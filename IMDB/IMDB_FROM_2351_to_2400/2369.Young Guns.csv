0,TheLittleSongbird,"Totally bogus in terms of historical accuracy, but taken on its own terms as a comedy-western Young Guns is a very entertaining film",7,22 September 2015,"The main selling-points of Young Guns are the incredibly compelling story of Billy the Kid and its very talented cast- actors like Kiefer Sutherland, Terrence Stamp and Jack Palance promises a lot. While it is a long way from flawless, this viewer did find themselves liking Young Guns a good deal.Young Guns does have its problems. The hard-rock soundtrack is incredibly jarring, can sound cheap and doesn't fit at all within the film, a lot of the film goes at a fast pace and the music sounded somewhat pedestrian at times. The storytelling does become a little less involving and quite ridiculous in the last third, where it also loses the momentum that the rest of the film has. Pacing is also a touch chaotic in places, and while he does what he can Charlie Sheen is badly wasted, his underwritten role doing little for his talents.However, Young Guns is a good-looking film, with handsome scenery, evocative costumes and some clever, stylish filming. The dialogue is very witty and funny, the film blisters in the action with a tense and exciting if rather far-fetched somewhat climactic shootout and while it does butcher history the story is compelling and goes at a breakneck pace. While it entertain in the comedy, excites in the action and rouses as a Western, there are some nice dramatic moments, Lou Diamond Phillips' scene where he tells of the slaughter of his family is the film's most heartfelt scene. The relationship between Billy and Doc is also very well done, providing a lot of heart and funny moments. . Christopher Cain's direction is crisp and efficient, his decision to do the action in first-person comes over more than effectively.Very good cast too, there have been mixed reactions to the performances quality, for me it was one of Young Guns' biggest strengths. There were initial reservations as to whether Emilio Estevez was too modern and too nice for Billy, but he is cool, fun and likable with a touch of sassiness in the role, and is closer in age to most other actors who have portrayed Billy. Kiefer Sutherland has one of the most strongest written characters in the film, and is remarkably poetic in this film, a pleasant change from the usual roles he takes on. Lou Diamond Phillips does overact quite broadly in places, but does mostly act with real soul and poignancy, especially in the aforementioned scene. Casey Siemaszko is also very affecting, when he overcomes his fear it came over very emotionally. Dermont Mulroney has some good intensity without going overboard, and he is very amusing as well. In lesser roles, Terrence Stamp is a sympathetically and touchingly played and tragic father-type of figure, and Jack Palance is perfectly cast as Murphy (a rather one-dimensional role but Palance does much with it, and is genuinely menacing without trying too hard. Brian Keith is memorable in his short appearance.Overall, not a flawless film in any shape or form and won't work for everybody but on its own terms it was a very entertaining film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Young Guns
1,bkoganbing,"""Regulators, Saddle Up""",8,5 August 2008,"This retelling of the Billy the Kid saga here and in the succeeding film, Young Guns II, is yet another fictionalized account of the doings in Lincoln County, New Mexico 1878-1879. One fine day we may get an accurate picture of the events. Here though several young actors some of whom were labeled the Brat Pack and who were coming up roughly around the same time in the Middle Eighties got an opportunity to play some real life western characters. The names of the characters these guys play are real even though the story is highly fictionalized to the extent that not all of them died during the period both films show.One reason I do like Young Guns is that it does show what is probably the most realistic portrayal of Billy the Kid. Forget Robert Taylor, Johnny Mack Brown, Paul Newman, when you see Emilio Estevez on the screen you are seeing the real Billy, basically a punk who was skilled enough to back up his brag.Estevez rides with Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, and brother Charlie Sheen. They are the 'regulators' who ride for John Tunstall the British rancher played here by Terrence Stamp.It was the relationship between Tunstall and his young regulators that villain L.G. Murphy (Jack Palance) touches on. It's certainly led to speculation that these guys were some kind of a gay harem for Stamp. I certainly am not going to comment one way or the other because we just don't know. What's more cause for the animosity is that old country resentment of the English rulers.What Young Guns essentially does is take the plot of the John Wayne classic Chisum and tell it from the Tunstall/Regulators point of view. Chisum himself is eliminated from the story, though he appears in Young Guns, II played briefly by James Coburn. So if you've seen that, you know what happens.The young guys are great and Stamp and Palance provide a good pair of antagonists. Brian Keith is around for a memorable performance as Buckshot Roberts, a well known bounty hunter of the period.Young Guns is a well done western with good editing at a pace that never drags. It's a modern classic not to be missed.",Young Guns
2,SnoopyStyle,Emilio Estevez goes nuts,7,25 December 2013,"William H. 'Billy the Kid' Bonney (Emilio Estevez) has trouble with the law. John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) takes him in just as he has done with several other young men. They call themselves Regulators. One day, Tunstall is killed by his competitor rancher Murphy (Jack Palance)'s men. Sheriff reluctantly deputizes the Regulators to bring the murderers to justice. However, that's just the start of an all out war.This is the best Brat Pack western. Emilio Estevez goes nuts in this movie. His manic laugh makes this movie. Oddly, Charlie Sheen plays the reasonable leader of the group. Kiefer Sutherland falls for Murphy's china doll Yen Sun. Lou Diamond Phillips is the Indian. Casey Siemaszko and Dermot Mulroney round out the Regulator crew. History be damn. This is fictional. Although there are some famous names for the characters. This is just a bunch of young guns having fun playing cowboys.",Young Guns
3,Prismark10,Young Guns going for it!,3,15 March 2015,"Young Guns was the brat pack western starring some of the brat packers of the late 1980s, well a few were deemed to be seen as rising stars such as Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko.The rest are more bona fide brat packers such as Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Lou Diamond Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland accompanied by a rock score. However there is also room for western veterans like Jack Palance and Brian Keith.Estevez is the hot headed Billy the Kid who became regulators when their boss (Terence Stamp) is murdered by Palance's gang.Now when the film came out some critics were rather sniffy about the film and you have to applaud the movie for shaking the genre up a bit. However it is bewildering silly as well. In the shootout with Brian Keith in the latrine, well they could had just gone round the side to attack him and even from behind. Maybe they needed a reason to write Charlie Sheen out of the movie a third of the way through as he was in demand as an actor at the time.There is also the silly scene where the characters get high which now looks laughable. Estevez character is supposedly to be fiercely loyal to his slain boss but also appears to be psychotic.I remember liking the film a lot when it first came out but now it looks dismal. You end up thinking why does Stamp's character want to surround himself with young lost men.Sutherland's poetic character comes off best but even his romance with the Chinese ward of Palance looks rather odd.",Young Guns
4,classicsoncall,"""Get ready for hell!""",8,14 October 2007,"I've always enjoyed watching this movie, and with my most recent viewing I followed up with the episode of 'Billy The Kid' from the three disc 'Gunfighters' DVD collection from Nonfiction Films (1998, listed as 'Gunfighters of the West' in the IMDb database). It was pretty surprising to see how closely the film followed real events in the life of The Kid, born Henry McCarty in New York City's Lower East Side in 1859. All the business with John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) and Alex McSween (Terry O'Quinn) is based in fact, although the real name of the Jack Palance character was Jimmy Dolan. He was a real life businessman (read that town boss of Lincoln County) who was challenged by Tunstall for rights to government contracts at Fort Stanton in the New Mexico Territory. Dolan headquartered his 'Company' at an establishment named the House of Murphy, hence the name Lawrence G. Murphy used in the picture. The ensuing Lincoln County Wars, often depicted as a range war, was in fact a mercantile war fought essentially over the right of one faction to make more money than the other.I've often wondered whether the real life Billy would have been as maniacal as the way he was portrayed by Emilio Estevez. I would almost think so, but with the kind of charisma that made him entirely likable as a person to those who knew him well and called him friend. Estevez, along with his brat pack buddies have an engaging chemistry on screen, even if most of it is spent dispatching members of Murphy's thugs. If not for Estevez's pacing of the character, the tone of the film would have been entirely different, as most of the men gunned down in the course of the story were simply murdered to avenge the death of Tunstall.My favorite scene had to do with the gunslinger in the saloon who Billy mocked into a gun-down. I'd consider that one of the fictional elements thrown into the story to highlight just how duplicitous the real life Kid could be. Did you notice how the gang reacted instinctively to back up their leader just in case?I'm not as familiar with the sequel to ""Young Guns"" as the original. Both were written by John Fusco, so I'd expect that the continuity relative to historical accuracy is similarly maintained. Over forty films have been made about the legend of Billy the Kid, along with the blatantly contrived two season TV Western ""The Tall Man"" from the early 1960's. Your best bet apart from the documentary mentioned earlier, while maintaining an element of entertainment, would be tuning into ""Young Guns"".",Young Guns
5,jboothmillard,Young Guns,5,14 April 2013,"I will firstly admit that I did not pay the fullest attention to this film while it was on, but I did understand everything going on, and I knew it was going to bit of an average film anyway, but still one I was interested in because of the all-star cast, from director Christopher Cain (The Next Karate Kid). Basically, set in 1878 in New Mexico, young gun men are picked up on the road by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) to work on his ranch, but they also learn to read and be civilised, but competitive cattle seller and rich rancher Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance) is hanging around and acting suspiciously. Tunstall is shot by Murphy's men during a scuffle, because Sheriff Brady (Daniel 'Danny' Kamin) is one of the gang Justice Wilson (Victor Izay) can't do anything about the situation, but attorney Alex McSween (Lost's Terry O'Quinn) persuades him to recruit the young men as deputies and give them the warrants to arrest the murderers. The young men: William H. Bonney (Emilio Estevez), who later becomes the infamous 'Billy the Kid', Josiah Gordon 'Doc' Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), 'Jose' Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko), do not intend to arrest the killers though, they just want to shoot them. After Dick and one of the others is killed the five remaining young gun men have the final showdown with Murphy and his gang, and Billy of course went on to become an outlaw and was eventually shot dead by Patrick Floyd 'Pat' Garrett (Patrick Wayne). Also starring Sharon Thomas Cain as Susan McSween, Brian Keith as Buckshot Roberts and Cody Palance, Jack's son as Baker. The cast all do their parts fine, especially Esteves in the leading role of the well known gunslinger, I may not have followed the story in full, but the action sequences are good to watch with all the guns firing and some blood, a not bad western. Worth watching!",Young Guns
6,Tweekums,A stylish retelling of the Billy the Kid story,8,11 March 2011,"This take on the story of Billy the Kid features Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Philips as Billy the Kid and his fellow 'regulators'; young men employed by rancher John Tunstall, played by Terrence Stamp. When fellow rancher Murphy murders Tunstall the regulators find themselves deputised and going after those responsible. They are meant to be making arrests but the leave a trail of bodies wherever they go, usually because Billy likes to shoot first and ask questions later. As the body count rises they find that they are now the wanted men so they must decide whether to try and run or turn and fight.This film contains a good cast who perform well, the story might not be true to what happened in New Mexico all those years ago but it is exciting and filmed in a stylish way; there are also quite a few comic moments which serve well to lighten the mood in between the thrilling action scenes. If you like Brat Pack films or modern westerns I'd certainly recommend checking this out but if you want gritty realism give it a miss.",Young Guns
7,ma-cortes,"Revisionist and contemporary study about William Bonney, alias Billy the Kid",6,6 September 2008,"This is a revisionist look about the known story of the West's greatest bandit. Contemporary-style Western with nice performances and fine direction by Christopher Cain who creates some good action scenes. The Kid is well played ,though sometimes overacting , by Emilio Estevez, he plays as a likable, sympathetic,attractive young and favourite with girls. Colorful and great cinematography by Dean Cundey. Modern and unfitting musical score by Anthony Marinelli. The motion picture will like to Western fans. Followed by a sequel titled 'Young Guns II'(Geoff Murphy,1990) with similar players and concerning about Billy and his band heading toward the Old Mexico and pursued by a posse.The picture is based partially on actual events. These deeds are the following: Billy(Emilio Estevez) became a cowboy in Lincoln County(New Mexico)for cattleman Tunstall(Terence Stamp) along with a young group(Kiefer Sutherland,Charlie Sheen,Lou Diamond Phillips,Dermot Mulroney,Casey Siemaszko). Tunstall was supported by lawyer McSween(Terry O'Quinn). But Tunstall was murdered by rival cattleman Murphy(Jack Palance) and started the Lincoln County War. Billy seeks revenge for his death and he converted an outlaw and nasty gunfighter with a price on his head. Bonney and his gang pull off a hot pursuit against the enemies. Billy, his band and McSween were besieged but he went out firing his gun and made his escape. The Kid was caught and convicted of killing and sentenced to be hanged ; though shackled foot and hand , he managed to getaway from prison by shooting dead the deputies guarding him. Pat Garret(Patrick Wayne), a former friend, was elected sheriff and set off in pursuit to capture him and on 1881 tracked at Fort Sumner and there shot him dead by surprise. Legend says that Billy murdered 21 men in his 21 years of life but is really thought to be much less.",Young Guns
8,wes-connors,Young Guns Go for It,4,16 May 2010,"These ""Young Guns"" are led by Emilio Estevez. According to the DVD sleeve's synopsis, ""The year is 1878, Lincoln County. John Tunstall, a British ranchowner, hires six rebellious boys as 'regulators' to protect his ranch against the ruthless Santa Fe Ring. When Tunstall is killed in an ambush, the Regulators, led by the wild tempered 'Billy the Kid' (Estevez), declare war on the Ring. As their vendetta turns into a bloody rampage, they are branded outlaws, becoming the objects of the largest manhunt in Western history."" This modernized ""Billy the Kid"" gang bang delivers its promised gunslinging action. But, that's about it. ""Young Guns"" only boasts authentic pretense. They have great hair and show off some butt cheeks. But, the ""Old Guns"" making cameos are better. Growing old gracefully, handsome Patrick (son of John) Wayne (as Pat Garrett) blows everyone out of the water. There are guns galore, but few females. The soundtrack rocks and the camera is grainy. In short, this is a western from the 1980s that stays there.**** Young Guns (8/10/88) Christopher Cain ~ Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen",Young Guns
9,michaelRokeefe,Death is dealt and mocked by young guns.,6,13 July 2003,"A brat pack resembling a ""Wild Bunch"" lets the bullets fly as Billy the Kid(Emilio Estevez)and his gang of ""Regulators"" are on the run into old Mexico where they are demi-legends. Action packed to say the least. Some fine performances turned in by some popular young stars:Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips and Charlie Sheen. Also in the cast are Patrick Wayne, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. And an un-credited cameo by Tom Cruise. This shoot-em-up shoots the hell out of a lot of 'em out there. Duck and reload. You can almost smell the gun smoke. A terrific modern western about the late 1870s wild west.",Young Guns
10,hitchcockthelegend,"If we're caught, we're gonna hang... But there's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip.",8,2 August 2012,"Young Guns is directed by Christopher Cain and written by John Fusco. It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, Casey Siemaszko, Terry O'Quinn, Jack Palance and Terence Stamp. Music is by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli and cinematography is by Dean Semler.Film is a telling of Billy the Kid's part in the Lincoln County War in New Mexico 1878. Plot sees the murder of John Tunstall send Billy and the rest of the Tunstall Regulators on a mission to avenge his murder.It ain't easy having pals.Often derided by Western movie purists as a sort of MTV Western made to showcase the various talents of the then Hollywood Brat Pack of Estevez, Sheen, Sutherland et al, Young Guns is actually a far more entertaining picture than some critical assessments suggest it is. It also has some rock solid Western history footings holding it up, yes it's far from accurate in various scenarios, age of characters and numbers in gangs etc, but the core story of the Lincoln County War is there. A massive success at the box office and spawning an equally successful sequel in 1990, Young Guns zips along at pace, contains high energy action sequences and provides plenty of quotable dialogue. Best of all, though, it doesn't take itself seriously, it wants to be a rooting-tooting Western of fun endeavours, if viewed on those terms it's an absolute winner, especially since the cast are playing it that way.Alex, if you stay they're gonna kill you. And then I'm gonna have to go around and kill all the guys who killed you. That's a lot of killing.Estevez is terrific as The Kid, blending boyish arrogance with fearless rage, a fun and scary character who is easy to get on the saddle with. Elsewhere it's a mixed bag, but apart from the disappointing Sheen, the casting decisions sit well and if you talk to ten different Young Guns fans you will most likely get a number of different answers come back as to who is their favourite Regulator (mine is Dirty Steve played by Mulroney if you are wondering?). O'Quinn is spot on as Alex McSween, Stamp adds classical tones to the ill fated John Tunstall and Palance is a neat fit as villain Lawrence Murphy. Nice to see Brian Keith get a cameo as a larger than life bounty hunter as well. Semler's photography and Cain's filming techniques are a bit too anachronistic at times and the Banks/Marinelli score too modern an accompaniment on occasions. But film rounds out as a nifty bit of Oater play for Gen X and showed that as the 1990s approached there was still love for this greatest of genres. 7.5/10",Young Guns
11,Hey_Sweden,"He ain't all there, is he?",7,19 May 2019,"""Young Guns"" is another in the long line of Hollywood movies to take inspiration from the real-life Billy the Kid legend. And ""inspired"" is the right word, since, once again, this is a fabrication of factual events. But, overall, the film is fun: fast-paced, violent, not hard to follow, very well shot (by ace cinematographer Dean Semler), and generally well acted.Emilio Estevez clearly has a ball playing the colourful outlaw in this story. It begins as British rancher John Tunstall (a wonderful Terence Stamp) recruits Billy as the latest in his ""family"" of outcast boys, whom the benevolent Tunstall employs as ""regulators"". Trouble brews when the villains, led by an effectively sleazy Jack Palance as Murphy, succeed in knocking off Tunstall. The boys are deputized into helping depose the villains, but Billy would rather go about seeking revenge. So, a couple of dead bodies later, and the Regulators become wanted men.Efficiently directed by Christopher Cain (whose wife Sharon Thomas plays Susan McSween), ""Young Guns"" is decent robust entertainment that goes for a much more visceral approach than an intellectual one. Not that that's really such a bad thing. It serves to showcase a ""Brat Pack"" sextet of young actors: Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Estevez' brother Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney, and Casey Siemaszko. Their performances are fine, but they tend to be outshone by veteran co-stars such as Palance, Stamp, Terry O'Quinn, The Dukes' son Patrick Wayne (playing Pat Garrett), and Brian Keith in an amusing but regrettably brief cameo as a scruffy old bounty hunter. Towards the end, keep your eyes peeled for Tom Cruise, in disguise as a bad guy who gets shot.With stylized opening credits, and a jaunty rock score, this is clearly filtered through 1980s sensibilities, so it might not appeal to Western fans across the board. But, in truth, it's not as gory as some people might fear, and it delivers some good action. The finale at the McSween homestead is an exciting one.Overall, entertaining stuff if somewhat overextended at 107 minutes.Followed by ""Young Guns II"" two years later.Seven out of 10.",Young Guns

One, it's filmed in New Mexico, and that is a good setting for a western. Secondly, it has a whole bunch of actors worth watching, even if they don't do a great job of acting.After Murphey's (Jack Palance) gang guns down the boy's guardian (Terence Stamp), they set out to arrest the perps.Once Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) starts the killing, the rest of the gang have no choice but to go along.

14,view_and_review,Regulators! Mount up!,8,21 March 2020,"""Young Guns"" was not only a spectacular movie, it was also the source of the sampled lines in the mid-90's hit rap song ""Regulators"" by Warren G featuring Nate Dogg. The Regulators were a group of young men taken in by John Tunstall (Terence Stamp). He educated them and used them to protect his financial interests. When he was killed by L.G. Murphy's men, Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) sort of decided for all of the Regulators that they would avenge Tunstall.Billy the Kid was fantastically fearless and not just a little bit crazy. Insurmountable odds and a rising bounty on his head didn't bother him one iota. In fact, it probably made him more fearless and crazy. He brought the movie to life and helped to give us the classic Western final gun battle.",Young Guns
15,morrison-dylan-fan,Young Guns: Part 1.,7,5 February 2007,"After having heard about this movie for a while,i decided to pick it up.I feel its a really enjoyable (and pretty fast-moving) Western. The plot: In the Wild West,a group of young cowboys are getting taught how to be more grown-up by rancher John Tunstall.(Terence Stamp) However,rival rancher Murphy ,wants to get rid of his main rival.So he gets his gang to go kill him.Due to the sheriff being in Murphys gang,an attorney decides to hire the young cowboys to arrest Murphy and his gang.Things go very wrong when one of the cowboys-Billy the Kid (Emillo Estevez) goes crazy,and instead of arresting some of the gang members,he decides to kill them!This leads to a bounty getting put on all of there heads,they think of going to Mexico,but when they find the attorney is going to get shot,they decide to go save him.When they get there,they find out that Murphys gang has plans for the attorney and them... View on the film: First,i have to say that the main flaw with this film is its 1980s rock score.The film would (i feel) have been enhanced if it had used a non-rock score.The cast:I have to highlight some really good performances in the film.First is Terence Stamp as John Tunstall.Even thought Stamp is only in the film for the first half-hour.He gives a really great performance and makes the ""regular"" role of the father figurer/elder his own.The most under-used in the film is Lou Diamond Phillips as Jose.Phillips does a really good job in the film (especially in the films strongest scene,where he talks about his mother.)While Estevezs does a good performance,for me he just feels a little bit not right to play Billy.The main problem for me,is that he just seems like a kid thats messed up(and someone who would not be remember along time after his death.)The last performance i want to highlight is Kiefer Sutherland as Doc.Sutherland gives a performances,that steals every scene he is in.Even thought he is meant to (along with the other cowboys) be nasty,he comes off as a very likable character. Direction:While directer Christopher Cain does ""homage"" to Sam Peckinpah, (espectley The Wild Bunch) he still does some very interesting things.One of the things Cain does really well (that i think is pretty creative) is that during some of the shoot-outs,instead of showing all of them in ""wide shots"",Cain shows it in first person,so you can see the tension from the cowboys point of view. Final view on the film: A really good ""recent"" western,with some great performances.",Young Guns

17,Wuchakk,Fairly accurate account of Billy the Kid & his gang,8,3 October 2016,"Released in 1988 and directed by Christopher Cain, ""Young Guns"" stars Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid, an orphaned teen taken in by English merchant John Tunstall (Terrence Stamp) who mentors him and several other 'young guns' – Richard 'Dick' Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Doc Scurlock (Keifer Sutherland), Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Malroney) and Charles 'Charley' Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko). When savage injustice strikes, the youths team-up as deputies, but their hunger for justice takes them beyond the law wherein they must be hunted as an outlaw gang. Jack Palance, Brian Keith and Patrick Wayne are also on hand.This is an excellent ""modern"" Western that sticks pretty close to history. The relatively lame 80's pop rock score wasn't as bad or prevalent as I remembered and, besides, it's mixed with some more traditional Western music, usually ""live"" stuff performed in the scenes, like banjo, guitar, etc. The movie is realistic with an amazing true-life story brought to action-packed life by a great cast with excellent performances and potent dramatic scenes (like, for instance, Chavez's notable venting sequence).Be sure to catch the excellent 30-minute documentary on the real-life Billy the Kid on the DVD for comparison to the events in ""Young Guns"" and the sequel.Speaking of which, 1990's ""Young Guns II"" is almost as good and is mandatory because it shows the rest of the story – the hiring of Pat Garrett to chase down the gang and put an end to it by taking Billy out. It also sticks pretty close to history, but takes some understandable licenses (e.g. Pat Garrett was never a member of Billy's gang).The film runs 107 minutes and was shot in New Mexico and Old Tucson, Arizona.GRADE: A-",Young Guns
18,mm-39,Bad acting,4,3 April 2002,"This film had a good script, but the acting was awful.  I like the ending, and how the story transgress from the beginning to the end.

It's based around Billy the Kid and his gang. These boys have been raised by a kind man who took them in when they could have ended up having miserable lives. When the sheriff and his evil men take his life, the boys rebel and take over the town.Young Guns is a pretty entertaining movie that I think anyone could get into. But I was a little concerned with Emilio as Billy the Kid, he just seems too nice to play him. But over all I'd say that he was convincing.

23,ElMaruecan82,It grew on me and I grew up with it ...,9,17 December 2011,"It seems that the 80's were so flooded by the ""Star Wars"" and ""Rocky"" films, by Steven Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones"" and so many other blockbusters such as ""Top Gun"" or ""Terminator"" that it didn't leave much room for some little gems like ""Biloxi Blues"" or ""Barfly"" or let's say for the Western genre, ""Young Guns""  one of my favorite westerns ever.Maybe, I'm using 'one of' as an understatement, as if I was ashamed to say 'm favorite', but I am not, I just gained some maturity, I saw more westerns since the day I discovered ""Young Guns"", and I can understand why this movie didn't get much acclaim, especially if you consider the period, the 80's, when Eastwood the director was reconquering the genre, and through ""Pale Rider"" prepared the audience to a darker form of revisionist westerns. ""Young Guns"" with its youthful cast introduced by one my all-time favorite intros: Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Casey Siemaczko and Dermot Mulroney, looks closer to the typical 80's film marketed for teenage audiences than a mature film meant to be taken seriously, on the surface only  because if you watch it, and decide to appreciate the film regardless of your personal tastes  well, I defy anyone not to be captivated by theses 100 minutes of pure entertainment.Yes, even the dark ""Pale Rider"" pales in comparison with ""Young Guns"", because the latter doesn't overdo the archetypes of the genre, it has its load of thrills, of chases, shootouts, parties, romances, discussions BUT with something more that lacks even in the most acclaimed masterpieces of the genre : it has characters, a wonderful gallery of characters, who carry their personalities less than stereotypes than true human flows, with their motives, actions and reactions, and within the plot of the film, there are different arcs involving each of these characters, handled with such a confidence, that nothing ever feels forced or cliché, and at the end, each of them would ultimately change, making ""Young Guns"" more than a Western but also a sort of coming-of-age story, a genre cherished during the 80's. And of course, the biggest change will concern the leader of the bunch who'll become one of the most defining legends of the Old West.As a kid, I grew up reading ""The Adventures of Lucky Luke"", a Franco-Belgian comic book set in the Old West, needless to say that I loved it so much, I was familiar with Billy the Kid, the stagecoaches, Jesse James, Calamity Jane, the Conquest of the West before I reached my tenth year, so I discovered ""Young Guns"" at the age of 13, with enough knowledge of the Old West to appreciate it and not enough of cinematic westerns to judge it impartially. And I'll never forget that night, when I saw it with my father, I didn't care much about the story until that young blondish guy introduced himself by ""William Bonney"" and the other said ""Pat Garrett"", I told my dad, ""hey, it's Billy the Kid, and this is the guy who'll kill him"" The movie took a whole new direction for me and it immediately grabbed my interest. And the rest didn't disappoint me.""Young Guns"" is a movie whose rooting process is slow but efficient, you definitely get into the story when the tutor, John Tunstall, remarkably played by Terrence Stamp, is killed by men who belongs to the cattle owner and biggest competitor, the evil Murphy, Jack Palance whose evil smirk hasn't lost its touch either. Then, the 'young guns' are mandated as 'regulators' to arrest the killers, then it all gets wrong when Billy, the previously underestimated newcomer makes this business personal. He makes himself an enemy through Dick, Charlie Sheen, the straight man of the bunch, who'll get killed as if fate wanted another kind of leader, and progressively, as blood is shed and guns are fired, we get into the others, Doc, Kiefer Sutherland as the poet in love with a little Chinese girl sold to Murphy for a dirty shirt, Chavez, Philips as the only surviving of a Navajo tribe killed by Murphy's men with the army as accomplice, and of course, his 'friend', the scene-stealing tobacco-chewing ""Dirty"" Steve.But the one who touched my heart the most was Simeaczko as Charley Bowder, the nicest and most friendly (also cowardly) of the bunch. It was a nice touch for the story to have a character who doesn't react as a coldblooded killer but feels sick from the simple thought that he might be hanged, and his evolution is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the film, as I never fail to have goose bumps in the scene where he finally overcomes his fear and start getting into the shootout that concludes the film. And talking of the shootout, it's certainly one of my all-time favorite climactic sequences because I never saw the way it started coming and the amount of thrills is so great that at the end, me and my Dad, sorry, my Dad and me  could only wow, and I knew I had just watched one of the greatest films ever.Yes, ""Young Guns"" became one of my all-time favorite films because of so many things, the extraordinary performance of Emilio Estevez, the difference between the characters and my rooting for each of them, the amazing shootout, the coming-of-age story and beyond everything, the emotional core of the film: a great message about solidarity and friendship, as mentioned by the concluding line of the film : ""Pals"", before followed by one hell of an amazing soundtrack.So say what you want, it may not be the best Western ever made, it didn't get any Oscar nominations, but for some reason, it will forever have a special place in my heart.",Young Guns
24,bowmanblue,So perfectly over the top,8,26 June 2014,"Young Guns is one of my 'guilty pleasure' films. I don't know whether it's because I saw it as a young boy in the eighties and still have some nostalgia for it, or whether it's genuinely a good film. Either way... I love it.It tells the (loose!) story of Billy the Kid, Doc Hollywood and co as they evade both the good guys and the bad guys as they go on their rampage of revenge when a corrupt land baron kills their mentor. Is it factually accurate? Who cares! It's just such good fun! Maybe it's the loud, overblown rock music (which is probably a little out of place when dealing with a 'wild west' film) that makes everything so cool, or perhaps it's the overused slow motion technique whenever an important gun fight takes place. Then of course you have Emilio Estevez at the height of his eighties fame, playing a completely manic (yet strangely endearing) anti-hero who shoots first and bares his bottom later.I'm guessing that this is a guy's film; it has action, chases, rock music and slow motion. What more could a guy what when he has a beer in one hand and a sofa to sit it? Possibly a horse and a six-shooter, but the TV's remote control will have to suffice.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Young Guns

(The talents of two older actors--Terence Stamp and Jack Palance were equally wasted.)What we received on the screen was a ho-hum Western, complete with good guys, bad guys, and crooked politicians. The dialog was supposed to be ever-so-clever, but wasn't, and the actions scenes had been done equally well in dozens of earlier movies. The formula--bring together a disparate group of hard cases, give them a reason for revenge, and let them kill and be killed.Not a bad way to spend an evening when nothing better is playing on TV.

Along with half brothers Estevez and Sheen, the movie poorly portrays life of the late 1880 period when the wild west was really wild.The plot and script are too weak and the star studded cast can't help the movie forward.

32,barnabyrudge,A semi-successful attempt to revitalise the western genre for a 1980s audience.,6,17 December 2006,"Young Guns is one of the only Hollywood westerns made during the 1980s, where it sits solitarily alongside the likes of Pale Rider and Silverado. By this time, the general public perception was that westerns had nothing new to offer. However, in this bloodthirsty and fast-paced retelling of the Billy The Kid legend, script-writer John Fusco and director Christopher Cain manage to find a few new angles. By populating their film with hot young talent, then cranking up the violence-levels like some modern retread of The Wild Bunch and underscoring the film with a pulsating rock soundtrack, the makers have found a reasonably effective way of breathing fresh life into a tired old story.Idealistic rancher John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) harbours a plan to recruit the wild and reckless youths of the Wild West to work on his Nebraska ranch. By showing them the care and patience they've never known, he soon gets these seemingly undesirable youths to become conscientious and hard-working ranch-hands, and even provides them with enough basic education to read and write. The plan falls apart when a rival rancher, Lawrence G. Murphy (Jack Palance), hires a gang of desperadoes to kill Tunstall. Following his death, Tunstall's young workers are determined to avenge their mentor. Initially they set about gaining their revenge legally, working as dedicated deputies out to nail those responsible for his murder. But their approach to the job proves so violent and trigger-happy that they themselves are quickly branded as outlaws. Under the leadership of the most hot-headed of their number William Bonney (Emilio Estevez), the youths leave a trail of corpses across the west as they track down their enemies. Soon Bonney earns the nickname Billy The Kid, and he and his gang of ""young guns"" become the most feared gunslingers around, hunted by the law and the lawless alike.Young Guns helped to launch quite a few careers. Estevez had already done some decent films prior to this one (Repo Man, The Breakfast Club and Stakeout spring to mind), but this was the first time that he was given the opportunity to grab a role by its throat. Among the many others making a name for themselves are the likes of Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulrooney and Casey Siemaszko. Meanwhile, seasoned old pros like Stamp and Palance provide the kind of expert support that they've done throughout their careers. While the pounding rock score and Brat-pack casting might provoke head-aches among western purists, it makes the film lively and energetic. The shootouts become increasingly stylized as the film draws to its blood-spraying conclusion. This stylization might be off-putting for some, but for others it adds to the film's sense of confident, over-the-top enjoyment. Young Guns is a fairly successful action film which definitely puts the ""wild"" back into the ""west"".",Young Guns
33,lukem-52760,ESTEVEZ IS AWESOME IN THIS EXCELLENT WESTERN,10,28 January 2020,"The great Emelio Estevez leads a Cool cast of then young stars in this Awesome modern western!!!I love Emilio Estevez & i think he's seriously underrated & ridiculously underappreciated ,yet he's made such a huge impact on the world of movies & Cinema.
Estevez was a mega star during the 80's with hits like ""The Breakfast Club"" among others & even into the early 90's he was still a big enough movie star to draw Audiences to the cinema with flicks like ""Mighty Ducks"" among others, but since the late 90's he pretty much disappeared from movies. He's a great Director now with Critical hit Drama's like ""Bobby"" among others, so he's still around but he only seems to be remembered for his 80's ""Brat Pack"" films which are no where near as good as his later films, such as my favourite of Estevez's work with ""Judgment Night"" from 1993, it's a dark & gritty urban survival Thriller & Estevez is excellent & gives a fantastic hero lead performance!!! But it's a rare almost forgotten Gem among his later 90's film work but it has reached Cult Classic status. Now i also loved his 90's Sequel ""Another Stakeout"" & it's a wonderful feel good Cop Comedy with that great Chemistry back between Estevez & Dreyfuss, but these Awesome films were all ""flops"" to the Critics & Estevez faded but not for me as I'm a big fan & consider Estevez as one of my all time top 5 fave actors!!!
I loved both his ""Young Guns films"" & his Sci-fi Thriller ""FreeJack"" & his fun as hell 80's sci-fi Horror ""Maximum Overdrive"" & his weird & Cool Comedy ""Repo-Man"" among others, so this guy is a legend of cinema in my opinion & not for the silly ""Brat Pack films"" as he's done way better film work.Anyway yes I'm a big Fan of Estevez, Young Guns is a well made & totally fun modern western with all those actors in the ensemble cast like ""Keifer Sutherland"" & ""Lou Diamond Phillips"" & ""Charlie Sheen"" & the veteran great & movie legend ""Jack Palance"" R.I.P who is excellent in this film!!! The cast is Cool & the action is Awesome & the music is great.
Estevez plays probably his most iconic role here as the infamous ""Billy The Kid"" & he nails the part with his Cool presence & Cheeky charm, he's great here & seems to be really having a good time playing this wild & crazy character & making it his own & ultimately becoming a Legend in his own way & style. Estevez is a great actor that doesn't get the recognition he deserves.

Billy the Kid) to clean up the bad old West. Director Christopher Cain has taken a folklore legend and turned it into a teenage, bubblegum action-comedy which bears more resemblance to a long playing rock video than a classic western.Emilio Estevez plays the sharp shooting vagrant who is wanted by the law for murder. A kindly English gent by the name of John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) takes the lad in, and he soon becomes part of the regulator gang that looks after John's beef live stock and other property interests. When cold-blooded Irishman Murphy (Jack Palance) has Tunstall shot down because of their rivalry, young Billy takes the law into his own hands, and soon the regulators are being hunted by Murphy's gang, the law, and several other money hungry mercenaries.Youthful audiences are sure to enjoy this movie due to the high-level action, rock style soundtrack (from Anthony Marinelli and Brian Banks) and the cast which includes Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko.Australian Dean Semler's cinematography is impressive, as are the sets (Art Direction by Jane Musky), but still ""Young Guns"" is way out of its league. John Fusco's storyline is an historical schmozzle, and the regulators are more akin to a bunch of yahoos horsing around than a group of hardened outlaws.Still it's entertaining on it's own level, but the unlikely finale doesn't really help the cause.Tuesday, September 20, 1994 - T.V.",Young Guns

However, it seems that with age my tastes have changed. The actors all still give good performances, but having a slightly worn out brain in my head, I start to see that what was fun as a teenager, now comes across as slightly psychotic. I'm referring to Billy of course, who even seemed to scare his friends in this version of events, something I didn't notice before. I laughed along as he killed the people that he was supposed to be arresting and felt his excitement at the chance of a fight or a shoot out, because that's how I was meant to feel at that age. Now I am older and almost a complete pacifist, although there are still a few people I could quite happily hit in the face. With a chair. Repeatedly. Anyway, as such, the violence doesn't interest me as much as the history of the characters and their journey.I'm not saying it's a bad film, just that it doesn't hit the notes that it used to for me. It's put together dvd edited well, produced and directed with a humour to balance out the fighting.
As modern westerns go, it's got to be one of the best, but it is a shame that they didn't follow the history more exactly. It really annoys me that they still do this with films. If it didn't happen don't put it in the film or change the names and the title to fit what you want to do without calling it an historic account.I will search out the second film and see if that still holds its own for me, although I don't remember that being factually accurate at all, but it does have Christian Slater in it, yum!",Young Guns

39,Movie-ManDan,One of the Great Westerns.,10,9 February 2015,"When people think of cowboys, they think John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Any cowboy movie that does not have them has some other tough, rugged, mean-looking dude as the star and as co-stars. Young Guns breaks that rule and is still able to come out a fantastic western. I'm not just saying this because it was the first western I'd seen, I really do think this is one of the very best.Young Guns is pretty much the Brat Pack in the old west. Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemazko play real life gunslingers: Billy the Kid, Doc Scurlock, Chavez Chavez, Dick Brewer, Steve Stephens, and Charley Bowdre. This is loosely based on a true story when ranch owner, John Tunstall (Stamp) takes the men (known as Regulators) under his wing to educate them and get them to protect his ranch. When crooked Murphy (Palance) murders Tunstall, the Regulators want revenge and justice to be done, but Billy the Kid's insanity causes a massive manhunt where the young men may not survive.Our leading actors may not be mean-looking, but they do provide a sense of brutality and great acting. Emilio Estevez looks like a child, but he delivers an Oscar-worthy role as the crazy Kid. Kiefer Sutherland plays a rare good guy who also does a great job. I'm surprised he didn't get many good guy roles after this. Casting directors probably disagree with me. Dermot Mulroney is the closest to a John Wayne/Clint Eastwood character. ""Dirty"" Steve Stephens chews tobacco and is a filthy slob. Phillips and Siemazko do the most emotionally driven characters that give the heart and seriousness that adds dimensions to this. That is what I love about this. Young Guns is a character-driven movie with a solid plot.3/4",Young Guns
40,p-stepien,A wasted opportunity,3,3 January 2011,"Delving back into the wild west and the times of Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez) is no easy matter. Even more so when we are dealing with the infamous Lincoln County War. In one of the most defining chapters of the wildness of the wild west Billy the Kid joins a group of cattle guards working for an English rancher John Tunstall (Terence Stamp). Despite coming from the shadiest backgrounds Tunstall manages to instill respect and become an almost fatherly figure. However the politics of Lincoln County won't allow for a peaceful happy ending, as Tunstall is murdered in cold blood by his local competitors Murphy and Dolan. In an attempt to bring about justice Tunstall's cowherds are deputised and soon they start bringing about their own bloody version of justice...After years I managed to return to the densely star-populated ""Young Guns"" (Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Jack Palance as well as Terry O'Quinn of ""Lost"" fame). I never remember being overly enthusiastic about the original, but I felt mildly intriguing when finding out that the events in the movie are actually a relatively true recreation of events. Naturally some script liberties have been taken, but I must admit that in this department the movie actually does a bang-up job.Nonetheless even such a strong story as the Lincoln County Wars, which has the potential of being a defining western movie, is not capable of hiding the multiple flaws of the movie. Emilio Estevez for one is a rather childish and clowny version of the Kid with almost no character development, which makes him feel more like a caricature. That said in general most of his accomplices are very thinly structured. With only a hint of attempting to flesh out the characters the film focuses on the story itself.But even here the plotting is jumpy and chaotic. Not to mention that the movie in general seems to totally lack heart and conviction. Even the most key scenes are dealt with poorly and with absolutely no artistic integrity (almost as if a made for TV movie). Forced to characterise the movie with one word I would have to chose ""lame"". Given the absolutely powerful source material driving around corruption, lawlessness of the law and the situation where the victims are turned into outlaws it is absolutely shocking that this disinterested depiction of a legend has become a household movie about Billy the Kid (while some absolutely supreme takes exist - Sam Peckinpah's attempt for one).",Young Guns
41,eric262003,Western Film With a Brat Pack Theme,8,8 January 2018,"It could be something worthy to laugh about knowing that the young pedigreed performers from the Hollywood industry would be seen wearing Western gear and sporting cowboy duds. However, the idea by director Christopher Cain and script writer John Fusco tied in with a more authentic feeling of the frontier characters that were portrayed in 'Young Guns"" from 1988. This serves as an indication of what young outlaws and enforcers had to go up against during a time where they only key thing to do is survive. As a trivial fact, Billy The Kid was only 22 when he died. Like these pedigreed upstarts, the many gunslingers in the Old West were trained to fight from childhood. Therefore, it was spot on that the principal cast were hungry youthful individuals making names for themselves. ""Young Guns"" strives to set its sight on delivering an accurate portrayal of the old frontier, however, the main premise is to focus on the life of William Bonney who would later mark his name as Billy the Kid. We see the evolution of Billy the Kid (an energetic Emilio Estevez) back when he was an apprentice to philanthropist John Turnstall (Terence Stamp) who was raising an elite of young fighters in adapting to the dangers the living conditions of the old west. When Turnstall is killed, the gang turn to the trustworthy Billy the Kid for leadership, thus the bloody hunger for revenge comes into fruition. The rest of the gunners include Doc Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), Jose Chavez (Lou Diamond Philips), Dirty Steve Stephens (Dermot Mulroney), Charlie Bowre (Casey Siemaszko) and Dick Brewer (Charlie Sheen). During the bloody trail, they go trough some familiar conflicts in their personal lives that will likely roll your eyes, but that burden is upstaged by really memorable scenes. While there's a lack of creating an original characterization of Billy the Kid as an energetic psychopath, Estevez does give his character a more natural modern-day approach. Billy is not that far from Estevez's previous character from the film ""Repo Man"". The scenes that were downers comes from Sutherland's scenes where Doc falls in love with an Oriental lady and wants to abandon the group. Cain does successfully capture the moments which the battles and shooting action takes place that's filled with graphic violence and fever-pitch energy. The memorable scene where Billy the Kid goes on a rampage and kills a few captured antagonists showcases just how messed up and dangerous this character truly is. Another memorable scene is where he brings down a potential bounty hunter that goes down with a tad of black humour. Director Cain must got the knack of getting a feeling for the Western genre. From the accents, to the clothing, to the settings and to the lingo that the characters have utilized along the way through each scene. In addition to that he has hired many familiar faces who have been in Westerns over the years including Jack Palance as the evil despicable Murphy (who could play evil better?), In addition to that, Patrick Wayne (son of Western icon John Wayne) has a cameo as Pat Garrett, the lawman who killed Billy the Kid. Sure it has a reminiscent of the old Westerns he father starred in back in the 1950's, but John Wayne would've easily killed these pampered heroes blindfolded. It's pretty weird for me to say this, but when the sequel came out, ""Young Guns II"", I thought that film was more improved due to the energetic direction from New Zealand born director Geoff Murphy. But if you like Westerns with a Billy the Kid character upgraded to fit the style of the 1980's then this movie is something or you to enjoy.",Young Guns

(R)Cattleman Stamp takes in wayward young men to work his ranch and civilize them, including William Bonney (Estevez), better known as Billy the Kid; when Stamp is murdered by Palance's hired gunmen, though, Billy and company jump to action, first as deputized lawmen and eventually as branded outlaws. Passable Western is rowdy, well-paced, and solidly performed, but also pretty shallow and formulaic. Overuse of gun smoke and close-ups during the shoot-outs obscures the action; little effort is made to consider the characters beyond one or two traits and a willingness to pull iron. A few interesting casting choices aside (e.g., Sheen playing the most upright and uptight of the bunch, even declining offered peyote), it's pretty standard stuff, and only seemed ""fresh"" at the time because of the shortage of cinematic Westerns during the late-80s and the Brat Pack-adjacent stars.

When he isn't cackling hysterically, he's yelling incoherently, or shooting somebody.It's the typical anti-hero oater, where murderers and thieves are idolized; while lawmen are depicted as arrogant, cowardly nitwits. In spite of that tiresome theme, the movie works. However, don't expect much historical accuracy in the depictions of the Kid, Pat Garrett or anybody else.Still, in spite of these weaknesses, the movie works to some extent and is certainly entertaining. Plenty of stampeding horses, bloodbath gun play, screaming onlookers, and so on. Enough to keep the most ardent action or Western fan involved, albeit on a detached interest level. What's lacking in character development is made up in non-stop pistol noise. Other than Estevez, the acting is all right, but nothing to write home about.Harmless Saturday afternoon shoot 'em up, worth a look.",Young Guns
44,DJAkin,Worst movie since ALL BILLY KID MOVIES!!,3,21 January 2002,"I have to admit, I love westerns.  However, there has never been a good Billy movie.  I am from Lincoln county (well close to it) and there is so much more to the Kid than YOUNG GUNS let's us learn.  Give me a break, the rat pack?  They can't play these western dudes.  They talk like they just got out of a country western dance club.  The only good lines are delivered by Lou Phillips.  There are a few good scenes but for the most part, it's a movie that only highschool kids can enjoy.  If you are a fan of true westerns (Stagecoach) then avoid this movie.",Young Guns
45,TheUnknown837-1,"a heavily flawed film, but it works mainly due to a brilliant performance by Emilio Estevez",7,18 November 2009,"""Young Guns"" is one of those movies that works not because it has solid directing or a particularly good script, but because the characters are formatted into three-dimensional human beings not from well-written dialogue, but from incredibly enthusiastic and charismatic performances by the cast. In screenplay form, it's really a mediocre film with a lot of flaws. But the six main characters, particularly Billy the Kid, are played so well and with such energy and charm by the cast, that it strangely enough makes the whole movie work.For those unfamiliar with the movie, ""Young Guns"" is yet another retelling of the story of Billy the Kid, the infamous Old West outlaw rumored to have killed twenty-one men within twenty-one years. And out of all the versions I have seen, this is my personal favorite. Historical inaccuracies plague the story, but communicates enough to basically tell what happened, how Billy the Kid was taken in off the streets by an English landowner (Terence Stamp) and then sought revenge after his caretaker's land feud-induced murder.The primary reason this movie works is because of, what I think is really an Oscar-caliber performance by Emilio Estevez as Billy the Kid. Estevez is brilliant in portraying the stereotypical idea of Billy the Kid as a short-tempered, maniacal trigger-happy but oddly enough charming and charismatic killer. He just has an uncanny way of zeroing in on his otherwise mundane lines to generate the personality of a half-insane shootist all too ready to crack a joke along with a gunshot, even if it only amuses himself. Supporting him are his real-life brother Charlie Sheen, Lou Diamond Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland, Dermot Mulroney, and Casey Siemaszko, all of whom are very young here and very good in their roles.With a less enthusiastic cast, ""Young Guns"" might not have been anything special because again, its screenplay is highly imperfect. There really isn't any depth to any character besides Billy the Kid and as a result, the characters other than the outlaws are rather a bit impersonal. Jack Palance's character of L.G. Murphy is well-played by the late great actor, but shallow in terms of impact. And the friendship between Billy the Kid and a lawyer played by Terry O'Quinn is really just used as a plot-mover. And there is also a very tired and uninteresting subplot involving a romance between Sutherland and a Chinese girl which merely fills time.Nevertheless, the movie works because of very strong and magnetic performances, some explosive and gritty action scenes, and a brisk running time. I've yet to see a perfect film version of the story of Billy the Kid and I hope there will one day be one, but as for now, this is the best I've seen and certainly the most charismatic and enthusiastic way that the outlaw has been played.",Young Guns
46,DunnDeeDaGreat,One of the few Westerns I love,7,15 June 2002,"Being a film buff all of my life, Westerns were the one film that I would prefer to watch growing up. The only westerns I care for are Sileverado, Unforgiven, The Quick and The Dead & Posee. Young Guns is a mixture of semi pop culture from the late eighties and western action. The cast is good and the direction is tight.",Young Guns
47,mentalcritic,A glass half full,7,28 May 2005,"More films have been made about Billy The Kid, whatever his birth name was, than any historical figure before or since. If you load the movie connections page for Young Guns II and take a look at all the films listed under ""version of"", you will soon see what I mean. While most films about The Kid paint him as a lunatic or an individual more monstrous than human, Young Guns gets the balance a little more correct by showing the humanity of the character. Which is a good thing, since the real William McCarty was basically a teenager fending for himself in a time and place where knowing how to operate a firearm was the difference between life and death. That is not to say that Young Guns gets the balance between fact and fiction entirely correct. But every little step towards telling the truth about this enigmatic victim of a deeply flawed society is a good thing.Of the two Young Guns films, the original can be judged to be quite a way more accurate. This is not to say it is without some glaring falsehoods, but given how Young Guns II took one of the most deplorable exaggerations of the Billy The Kid myth and ran with it, it is an improvement. The Kid we see in this film is a cross between the silent heroes of many a typical Western (think a young Wyatt Earp) and an ancestor of Axl Rose. In other words, the sober, thoughtful Kid has been replaced with something more palatable to teen audiences. The rest of the characters get a fairly severe age reduction, with one notable exception. The real John Tunstall was less than half the age of the John Tunstall shown in this film when he was killed. Whether this revisionism was meant to build sympathetic focus towards the Kid by proxy of Tunstall, or just to increase the appeal to the teen market, is something the viewer can only guess at.In the end, the strength of the film lies in the support cast. Not to take anything from Emilio Estevez's performance, as I've seen at least two people who concern themselves with preserving the true history of Billy The Kid rate Estevez as the best actor to perform the role to date. No small feat considering the historical figure has appeared in fifty-one films, and countless TV series. But in this instance, it is the performances of Terry O'Quinn and Kiefer Sutherland, trying to act as the rational counter to an increasingly mad Kid, that take home the gold medal. Of the whole 1980s Brat Pack, Sutherland enjoyed the most success as a creative artist in general, and the reason is readily apparent here. Likewise, you can see why Lou Diamond Philips' career has basically died after his success here and in La Bamba. Aside from a grating tendency to overact, he really needed to learn faster how to ask the director why his lines seemed so utterly retarded or stilted.Not that Philips was alone in having to deliver some truly excruciating dialogue. Jack Palance, a man whose weirdly breathless style of delivery can make the worst lines memorable, unfortunately finds himself doing exactly that here. Terence Stamp sinks his teeth into a terribly underwritten father figure role, which was completely unnecessary both for the nature of the real man behind the character and dramatic purposes. Sure, the film was supposed to be about the youthful, vibrant nature of these outlaws, but given that The Kid was the youngest of the bunch by a margin ranging from years to even a decade, this drives the whole thing into the dangerous territory of bowdlerising. The real Chavez, for example, was known to be at least eight years The Kid's senior, and served eleven years of a life sentence after very narrowly avoiding being hanged for murder. This is not to say that the manner in which being aligned with the wrong merchant could determine one's chance of getting some justice was deserved, but it only cheapens the drama to make the characters so squeaky clean.Where Young Guns rescues itself is in some of its action sequences. The shootout between the Regulators and Buckshot Roberts has all the right tension and drama. It is also an uncanny display of the notorious inaccuracy of nineteenth century firearms, where one can fire at a target standing not twenty feet from them and miss simply because the bullet and barrel were aligned the wrong way. The climactic shootout at the McSween house is very well made, but suffers from some ill-advised and badly-executed uses of slow-motion. It also picks exactly the wrong time to emphasise The Kid's sense of humour. Graceful under pressure he was, maniacal enough to laugh hysterically when an entire battalion of the army was lining up outside his door, he wasn't. Oddly enough, in the real-life version of this battle, Scurlock was already married, and his father-in-law killed one of the participants. In fact, many of the participants shown here outlived The Kid by some margin. But that only serves to highlight how willing the film is to repeat myths and exaggerations, even in narrative form, as fact.It is for this reason that I gave Young Guns a seven out of ten. When it is simply trying to present an action theme with a mob of famous outlaws at its centre, the film excels. When it tries to present any factual basis to its storytelling, it falls flat. In film, this is probably one of the best, if not the best, introductions you will get to the Billy The Kid myth, but it should come with a subtitle or something in the credits to encourage the viewer to do a bit of further research.",Young Guns
48,thekarmicnomad,2021 Revisit - still loving it,7,23 June 2021,"This is a very fresh Billy the Kid story told from the perspective of the kid.It has a host of vibrant young actors who were at the top of their popularity and given great characters to work with.This portrayal of Billy the Kid was (and still does) feels very fresh.Rather than a hard nosed killer or a robin hood character he is depicted as a young man who wants to make the world a better place... a better place according to him of course.Oh yeah, and he is a total psychopath.Did you ever had one of those friends who is full of energy and really good fun to be around, but at the end of the night, when someone cuts in line in the taxi queue, they kick off? You tell them a thousand times to just let it go, but you both know that they have already made-up their mind to start a fight and, one way or another, the police are going to attend.This is Emilio's Billy.He is charismatic and fun and wild and free with an absolutely blithe attitude for human life.He is not cruel or evil and has a strong morale code. But his self centered nature makes him dangerous and unpredictable.This film is old now and the production feels a little tired and the score for this film is awful, really really bad.But the characters and story more than make up for this.I have a big chunk of nostalgia for this film but even trying to see past that I think this is very good and very fresh for a western.",Young Guns
49,one9eighty,Regulators... Mount up!,6,24 February 2021,"The first time I watched ""Young Guns"", in the early 1990's, it impressed me. It was like watching the cool kids of the wild west making up the rules as they went. With the cast that the film brought there was a rat-pack/brat-pack feel to it too with the likes of Estevez, Sheen, and Sutherland in it. Re-watching the film as a more 'mature' audience (rather than a teenager), some of that rule-breaking cool that the characters brought then, in particularly Estevez's William H. Bonney (a.k.a. Billy the Kid), now seems less cool, and more petulant and annoying. I will get into that some more later though.The film starts off with Terence Stamp's John Tunstall and Kiefer Sutherland's Doc Scurlock picking up a bad-boy runaway, Estevez's Billy the Kid. Tunstall gives a home, education, and purpose to outcasts that aren't necessarily friends of the law. When Billy joins up, Tunstall already has a 6-man posse of riff-raff on his staff. When the kids aren't helping around the farm they are regulating, and they ""regulate any stealing of his property"" (I'm not quoting Warren G's anthem, the G-man samples the film in his ""Regulators"" song). So basically, the kids aren't just there to work the farm and learn a purpose, they are hired guns and muscles that can protect Tunstall and his interests. When Tunstall is gunned down by Lawrence Murphy's gang, who Tunstall has been in competition with, the 'young guns' are begrudgingly deputized in order to bring the outlaws responsible to justice. Unfortunately, the west is still wild, and as the roam Lincoln County in New Mexico, not all the young guns have the same idea of justice. ""Dick"" (Sheen) wants to arrest the responsible outlaws, while Billy's justice is execution. This puts the gang on the wrong side of the law and end up being wanted men - so they make a run for it. Again, not everybody is happy with doing a runner, especially when vengeance for Tunstall and their friends hasn't been served properly.The casting for this film was eye-candy to 80's audiences. Most of the main stars had been in big hits before they were assembled in this western action film. They all do a decent job in delivering their performances, and for the most part I do not have much beef. One of the things I did have a slight issue with is that they were all supposed to be under the age of 20-years. This however is Hollywood of the 1980's and quite often audiences were told somebody was a teen, even when they had 5-o'clock shadow and crow's feet.The standout among the group is Emilio Estevez in the starring role of Billy the Kid. As a teenager watching this film, I thought he was cool and always seemed to push the boundaries of what was acceptable. As a much older viewer nowadays, my opinions have changes slightly. These days the character would warrant a slap and be sent to bed with no supper. The choices he made constantly got the group into trouble, and in some instances, it got them dead too. This is the wild west though - and from reviews and studies I have read there seemed to be a lot of historical accuracy in the performances and characters.Some reviews have suggested that the way this film played out was closer to what happened in the Lincoln County War than other films before it, the notable exception is the John Wayne film ""Chisum"" from 1970. In fact, some commentators have said that, with how accurate the characters were to real-life in ""Young Guns"", only the addition of a John Chisum character could have made it more authentic. Despite the plaudits the film got about certain historical element it got right, the film still plays fast and loose with other historical accuracies. Let's face it though - this is entertainment and not a documentary, there has to be some Hollywood embellishment here or it might not have appealed to the box office and grossed the $56 million that it did. Because of its success, despite how the film ends and the narration that mentions Billy the Kid's eventual demise, 1990 brought audiences a sequel in the form of the creatively titled ""Young Guns 2"".From a technical point of view the film revamps and updates some of the more traditional elements you would expect to see in a classic western film. Camera work is good and there are some nice scenes shown. Some of the post-production and editing is a little cheesy, especially the end with the number of slow-motion shots that are played out - but its still fun. The wardrobe department did well to make the kids look cool but authentic too. And music, decent enough although its modernised a lot so make this the rock-and-roll version of a western films.""Young Guns"" as a whole is a fairly enjoyable film which has a decent pace and features some fun performances. It isn't going to be something that everybody enjoys, but it is good pulp-fiction to western fans. It is a buddy-road movie in a western style which is very much ""ride of die"", and ""pals stick together like family"". There have been better westerns in the past, better western films came after this too - but as a contribution from the 1980's, this is a decent enough entry with plenty of fun and 80's feels to it. If the likes of ""Rooster Cogburn"" (1975) is an acoustic guitar, and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is a jazz trumpet, then ""Young Guns"" is definitely a 1980's flying-V heavy metal guitar with amps turned up to fuzz and crackle. But just like hair-metal of the 80's, this film isn't as fresh as it once was to me.",Young Guns
50,Maziun,Good teenage western from the 80's,6,23 February 2014,"This western was obviously aimed at the teenage audience , but it's not a bad thing. It's actually a quite refreshing take. The main heroes are young and not certain of their actions . The movie does reminds sometimes a music video (the opening credits , the final shootout) and the rock guitar solos work really well as the soundtrack.Emilio Estevez (""Stakeout"") , Charlie Sheen (""Major league"") , Kiefer Sutherland (""The Lost boys"") and Lou Diamond Philips (""Stand and deliver"") all give nice performances. Their characters aren't really complex , pretty much one note , but they managed to make them likable and interesting. Estevez gets the most attention , since his Billy The Kid is the most interesting of them – irresponsible hothead , typical ""shot first , then ask questions"" guy. Sheen is a calm and religious guy , Sutherland is a mild mannered poet and Philips is a mysterious Indian. There are also two other characters played by Casey Siemaszko and Delmot Mulroney , but they aren't really interesting. Last , but not least there is a good performance by Jack Palance (""Batman"") as the villain.This is pretty much a action movie , but also a story about friendship and loyalty. I think it's a little weaker than other westerns from the 80's like ""Tom Horn"" , ""Pale rider"" and ""Silverado"" . Still , it's a satisfying movie that might be enjoyable even by people who usually don't like westerns. I give it 6/10.",Young Guns

This film is primarily about youth and how it can be lost so quickly, so easily. All of these guys became men too young and lost their chance for youth. And they paid for it. This is also about good and evil. Emelio Estevez is excellent as the more or less evil Billy the Kid. He and the others (Keifer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Lou Diamond Phillips are given a chance to become ""good"" after straying from the right path.

I really dug this flick when it came out on video, and I need to plug it good here for two reasons. First, my parents claim I was playmates with the Sheen (Estevez) boys, because I grew up in Greenwich Village and my parents were running around in the same artsy crowd with Martin Sheen. So I always give those two probably much more credit then they deserve. Second, I made some serious jack playing the end scene to middle aged guys with money to burn on a new thing called Dolby Surround THX in the late 80's to early 90's. The soundtrack if played on a home theater system was so highly exaggerated that you'd have to be deaf not to hear the ricochet's going from front to back! The movie is very light on dead spots. It's made for the teens and attention span was a real factor in its making. There's action just to kill time in this flick and it works, Emilio's snappy dialog and crazy antics make it really interesting, and I also thought Casey had some bits that almost stole the movie for him. Brian Keith, Terrence Stamp, and the great Jack Palance add some legitimacy to also bring it up a notch. I just watched this flick in full on cable at my current job (the ""decent"" surround systems don't cost $4,000+ anymore so no more commission salesman job for guys like me, I've got a ""real"" job now, lol), and it brought a tingle up my spine to see that ending again as I remembered every line that was being said.

Aside from this, it is a great film with superb performances from all concerned. It tells the story of a group of regulators on the run after their boss/teacher is killed, and they see revenge. Among them is Billy the kid who seeks fame and fortune, and Doc who simply wants a quiet life with the woman he loves. The film has many memorable moments, including the peyote scene induced by Lou Diamond Phillips, a shockingly underused actor, and the final shoot out. We want all of them to survive, as we grow to love their individual characteristics, but not all of them do in the quest for revenge.

A few weeks ago saw it for $3.95 and snapped it up quick.There's a few reasons why this DVD is so cheap. (A) The quality for a DVD is pretty poor (B) The movie isn't that rewatchable. I hadn't seen it for maybe 10 years and remembered it being way better than it was this time. The only reason I can see for this is due to the star factor. On the DVD they keep going on about how cool the cast is, and back in 1988 they were, problem is nowadays they aren't really still at that elite level.Charlie Sheen- Is now a sleazy laughing stockEmilio Estevez- Never did anything of note really after this, except ""Young Guns 2""Lou Diamond Phillips- Also no longer cool, except when he appeared in ""24"" last seasonKiefer Sutherland- Still cool, but he was wussy in this movie and shattered my Jack Bauer image that he's worked so hard onIf you don't know, the movie is the story of ""Billy The Kid"", a renegade who went on a killing spree in the old west to avenge the death of a man who took him in and looked after him.

58,jackasstrange,The film which resuscitated the western genre,8,19 December 2013,"After a long while of starvation in the western genre, in 1988 a film stand out in this genre and became a major hit: Young Guns. It is really a western with a 80s feel on it, very different from the ones made previously, and with also a cast of familiar young faces resulted in a great box office draw. It does not matter if you like this film or not, but it definitely was the precursor of the 'new western wave', a the title that should be respected. And above it all, it is a very entertaining film. Emilio Estevez is aces in the role of the wild and hot- headed 'Bily the Kid', and he definitely it's the best character in the film. The dystopia theme in this film are very well- executed in my opinion, but far from being realistic. But hey, it does not matter at all if it's realistic or not. The story is involving enough to make you not to think about the 'fantastic' aspects, at least not during the film. The cinematography was awesome. The scenarios were undeniable well-done. The soundtrack with the typical 80s beats was new,I've never listened this beats in a western film before, but i thought it was fine and fitted some action scenes.One of my favorites films from the 80s. 8.3/10",Young Guns
59,bluesman-20,Six reasons why the west was wild,10,16 September 2009,Young Guns is perhaps the closest to the truth that Hollywood will ever give to the Billy the Kid Lincoln county war saga. the actors chosen to be the regulators are fantastic. Now when I first went to see this film I was a Big Lou Diamond Phillips fan La Bamba had made an impression on me. However Young Guns sealed the deal Emilio Estevev is astounding as Billy the Kid. Jack Palance is nasty as the films villain and Keifer Sutherland is superb as the gentle poet turned gunfighter named Doc. Charlie Sheen did a able job and in fact some of the best moments in this movie come from the interaction between Sheen and Estevev. The direction is crisp and sharp the action is breathtaking and the humor actually produces laughs that are heartfelt and real. Patrick Wayne's cameo as PAt Garrett foreshadows events we know that happened When PAt Garrett Killed Billy The Kid a year later. However none of that matters here. This film conveys the sense of family that the real billy the Kid and his regulators must of had and felt and it translates beautifully to the screen.,Young Guns

From the first time of seeing Young Guns at the movies in 1988 to the present day each time I watch it I enjoy it. Now considered a classic with many TV viewings this is a movie you learn by heart, many of the scenes with Billy the kid (Estevez) are so well respected and remembered. The performances from Sheen and Lou Diamond Phillips are great it worked so good with the Emilio character.

The music in the film is a little jarring in places,electric guitars screaming Van Halen style over a western horse chase feel very much out of place but its never distracting enough to take you out of the fun.

The start is very true to the events that happened, and shines a light on who is good or bad in a lawless society. The modern day heroes of the West usually played as law-men one day and outlaws the next.. The Earp brothers and Doc were a legal mob running Tombstone, the OK corral was a massacre of their rivals under protection of the law.

I also liked the Kiefer Sutherland part, it was wonderfully different from the way  Western characters are usually shown.Though I did not quite get the Indian trance sequence and though the finale was, let's say, a tad unrealistic, I like this film a whole lot because it is exciting and you can identify with the characters even though they are, in a way, cold-blooded killers (well, especially Billy).

65,DeuceWild_77,"Action packed western with a modernist touch, way better than what film critics said when it was released !!",8,23 February 2020,"A box office hit when it was released in '88, in a case that audiences did not follow the bad reviews, ""Young Guns"" is an action packed western with a modernist touch, written and produced by John Fusco (""Crossroads"", ""Thunderheart"", ""Hidalgo"") and directed by Christopher Cain (""The Principal"", ""The Stone Boy""), two interesting filmmakers, and featuting a cast of some of the best young adults performing in the 80's.Set in the years that led up to the Lincoln County War, which took place in New Mexico during 1877-78, the screenplay makes some good use of historical figures such as Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, John Tunstall or Lawrence Murphy and real situations that occurred mixed up with fiction to fit the cinematic value of this screen adaptation.Gritty, witty and mean, well structured and staged, especially on the action scenes, this movie is way more than 'Brat Packers with cowboy boots' that the 'professional film critics' spreaded in their nasty reviews. First of all the only 'Brat Packer' in the cast is Emilio Estevez, and ""Young Guns"" resembles more a ""The Outsiders"" ('83) set in the Old West than ""The Breakfast Club"" ('85) or ""St. Elmo's Fire"" ('85), curiously, all starred by Emilio.Some good camerawork by Dean Semler; a catchy western tune by conductor Anthony Marinelli and competently made art design and wardrobe enhanced a way interesting film that helped the western comeback in late 80's, after a decade that only ""Silverado"" and ""Pale Rider"" (both '85) were considerable hits.
The sometimes dark and cynical tone of this film were ahead of its time and became more popular in the 90's.Last, but surely not the least, its tremendous cast led by Emilio Estevez, joining Christopher Cain again after they both worked in S.E. Hinton's ""That Was Then... This Is Now"" ('85), playing the ruthless Billy the Kid with his characteristical charismatic laugh in one of his more remarkable roles; Kiefer Sutherland as ""Doc"" Scurlock, the soft spoken poet turned gunfighter; Charlie Sheen, who was a big and demanding star when this movie went into production after ""Platoon"" ('86) and ""Wall Street"" ('87), but filmed his short role of ""Dick"" Brewer to give star power to a movie starred by his older brother, Emilio, and Lou Diamond Phillips, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko, respectively, Jose Chavez y Chavez, ""Dirty Steve"" Stephens and Charlie Bowdre who were outstanding fleshing out their characters.
Lou have an incredible scene talking about the fate of his tribe; Dermot is a riot as a dumb hillbilly with an attitude problem and Casey is just perfect in his naiveness and brute force at the same time.The supporting cast is consisted of such veteran screen legends as Brian Keith (""Deadly Companions"", ""Nevada Smith""); Patrick Wayne, the eldest son of The Duke, playing Pat Garrett and Jack Palance in the villanous role of Murphy which shades his Oscar nominated performance in ""Shane"".
Classic actor Terence Stamp leaves a mark as the englishman John Tunstall, always a masterclass in acting, and character actor Terry O'Quinn delivers the goods as the honest lawyer, Alexander McSween.Blink an eye and you'll miss a cameo by Tom Cruise, disguised with a moustache in a non-speaking part. He's at the siege near the end when Casey Siemaszko is leaving the house.
Cruise did this cameo just for the fun ot it, when visiting his best friend Emilio on the set.
Years later, Emilio would appear in ""Mission Impossible"" ('96) in a non-billed extended cameo as the ill-fated Jack Harmon, one of I.M.F.I give it a 8.5Way better than what the critics said, recommended !!",Young Guns
66,yojimbo999,"Slick, great Western",9,6 May 2003,"One of the best westerns.

67,Goon-2,The actors help,5,9 February 1999,"There are plenty of other genres of film that I prefer over the ""western"" genre, but if I am to consider myself a true film buff, than I have to try everything, right?Maybe that's the reason why I watched ""Young Guns"", I don't know. I suppose it could have been for the actors, and ""Young Guns"" boasts a so-so cast of them: Emilio Estevez, Charlie Sheen, Lou Diamond Phillips, Kiefer Sutherland, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko. Obviously, as actors go, some are better than others(Siemaszko, Mulroney, and I suppose Sutherland outweigh the other three), and as far as the performances go, some are also better than others, with Siemaszko as the most moving and Estevez as the most miscast.I don't know what it is about Emilio Estevez's performance that bothered me so much, because usually I don't mind him, but in this one he just didn't ""click."" For one thing, he doesn't look believable as a cowboy, he just looked like he was playing dress-up, basically. For another, he spoke in some weird faux-Southern accent and I guess I don't really like those with most actors. Either you are Southern or you aren't. He also made his voice all deep and ""cold"", and I just don't even know how to explain it. I just didn't like him. If it's any consolation, I didn't really care for Lou Diamond Phillips either.I was somewhat more impressed with the work of Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko. I have seen ""Young Guns"" about three times now, and for some reason, I did not really register Mulroney's work until about the third, but he has a great role! Very funny. Casey Siemaszko also gave a rather good turn, which for some reason, also took me a couple of tries to really notice. While he probably plays the most ignorant of the Young Guns (and Siemaszko often gets stuck playing people who are not of high intelligence), his character has enough wit and depth to get past the ""dumb guy"" role. He also gives it a nice ""sensitive"" touch, that suggests that maybe Charley Bowdre is smarter than anybody allows him to be.But sometimes good acting just isn't enough. Films need to have interesting writing in order to hold my attention, and ""Young Guns"" didn't deliver enough of that to me. Nevertheless, I didn't HATE it, and I am sure that if people like westerns, and are more used to the formula, or if they really like one or more of the actors, than they will get into this movie.",Young Guns

This movie plays fast and loose with history and is in not particularly accurate about most details but as an enjoyable western adventure it succeeds. The movies style harks back to the old days of the western adventure such as Rio Bravo etc and while nowhere near it in terms of class it is a worthwhile watch. Jack Palance makes a fantastic bad guy and Terranc Stamp puts in a good performance as the gangs father figure. Performances of the brat pack are pretty good and I really enjoyed Estevez's portrayal of the kid. If you like westerns and enjoyed modern versions such as Tombstone you'll enjoy this movie.7/10 - Not exactly Unforgiven or Rio Bravo but still a worthwhile watch for any western fan.",Young Guns
70,Mickey-2,A pack of young stars take on the western legend known as Billy the Kid.,8,6 July 2007,"The year is 1870 and the place is Lincoln County in New Mexico territory. A young William H. Bonney is rescued from a possible hanging by John Tunstall, who befriends the youth and makes him part of the family of young guns known as Regulators. This puts Billy in the midst of a territorial dispute between Tunstall and the Santa Fe Ring, led by Lawrence G. Murphy, villainously portrayed by Jack Palance. Another western legend, Pat Garrett, is played by Patrick Wayne, the son, of course, of John Wayne.After the killing of Tunstall by Murphy's henchmen, the Regulators and Billy hit on all cylinders in extracting revenge for the slaughter of their benefactor. The Regulators are branded as outlaws, and the ""legal forces"" of Murphy attempt to pare them down to nothing. This leads to a final shootout on the streets of Lincoln, and very few of the original Regulators escape, which leads to the sequel of ""Young Guns,"" appropriately called ""Young Guns II."" The cast of young and upcoming Hollywood stars include Emilio Estevez as Billy, Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen, Lou Diamond Phillips, Casey Siemaszko, and Dermot Mulroney.One final note: the DVD includes as part of its special features section a Trivia Track, which flashes western facts and information about the stars or the characters being portrayed on screen without detracting from the viewing of the film.

72,bobc-5,Interesting modern western relies a little too heavily on cliche,6,18 July 2001,"An Englishman running a New Mexico ranch in the old west recruits wayward young men to be his ranch hands. Among their duties is protecting the ranch from his more powerful and villainous neighbors, thus earning them the title ""regulators"". Through a combination of discipline and nurturing, he is able to civilize the men and give them discipline. When murdered by another rancher, the regulators are deputized to help catch the men who did it. But one of the regulators, known now as Billy the Kid, is a relative newcomer who has not yet learned self-discipline. Engaged in a power struggle for leadership of the group, he is far more interested in killing the villains than bringing them to justice, thus turning the group into outlaws themselves. Although the movie is very well made, it never really explores the potential of the plot, relying instead on cliches to entertain us. It also seems completely confused in its portrayal of the main character. Is William Bonney a homicidal maniac or a fiercely loyal man out to avenge the death of a father figure? Is he a caustic head-strong youth or a steely smooth-talking leader? Depending on the scene, you can take your pick. He's clearly supposed to be a sympathetic anti-hero, but this is accomplished only by turning his antagonist into a cartoonishly evil villain, portrayed in perfectly predictable manner by Jack Palance. The shootout scenes are nicely filmed, but as the movie progresses they move more and more towards standard western cliche. The strongest point of this movie is the relationship of the characters played by Sutherland and Estevez. Doc is strongly attracted to Billy the Kid and admires his strength of character at the same time that he fears him and is repulsed by his murderous actions. Both actors do an excellent job trying to pull this off in spite of the limited development which the script allows. This and the support of a very competent cast makes the film worth watching but not necessarily worth going out of your way for.",Young Guns

Although they took some (slightly indecent) liberties with Certain Truths, other accurate depictions were enough to offset these typical cinematic variations. I'm not big on horse operas, big-screen or small, but my curiosity here was piqued all these years later due to happening upon my sat provider's on-demand less than enthusiastic 2-star rating. At 1st I wasn't thrilled, despite the interesting array of the main actors' opening credits (that godawful non-Western noise masquerading as ""music"" & the so far earliest example of a real irritant, ""music supervisor"" not only contained therein but before 8 composer credits - which without, there wouldn't *be* no music to ""supervise""), but quickly I was drawn into the circumstances having seen a couple of Lincoln County War documentaries. They were all very effective in their performances, even Sutherland - of whom I'm no fan from his flatlined mumbling in that beige dull overrated ""24"" - & was right delighted when their names came up of Brian Keith & that legendary Jack Palance in the mix. With Keith's CV (""cinema vitae"") brimming with appearances in other pre-auto productions, his portrayal of Buckshot had a perfect-fit weathered comfortableness to it that we could wish for more. And Lou Diamond Phillips channeled the pain of dispossessed & disrespected people so well in recounting the unhappily true (though given a different name) massacre that it was All Too Easy to be surprised that he isn't really of American Indian descent. Throw in Palance - who owned every role he was in & whose theatrical just-desserts end here (slo to the mo) did not impress as corny, Terence Stamp playing so well a man who actually was far younger in those days, & the never-too-much portrayals of these Regulators by the ensemble, & it mystifies me as to this film's low regard. (Of course with their ears bruised by that cacophonous Background Score it's not a wonder in some cases they'd be little inclined to be more generous.) So for a rarity this surprising accidental discovery takes a place in my collection of favorites. I'm of a cautious bent about its '90 sequel, ""II,"" & my jaw really took a drop in seeing now 7-month-old news of a potential ""3"" being cooked up. That would be 33/31 years after the 1st 2, seriously stretching it in the time lag department, & Mister Emilio might need some trank powder sprinkled in his oatmeal on that one. Well, Stetsons off to him if he can Make It Happen; but fancier upgrades won't supersede the earthy charms of this original. The moviegoing public can hope at least for better music.",Young Guns

The movie just was horrible as a whole. The one liners and all that, they appeal to most people. I just didn't find the movie worth sitting through to get to them. Your time would be better spent watching pretty much anything else these guys were in. (Really shocked me when Young Guns II came out!)

77,talarisw,"Six reasons why the west was wild as a group of ""young guns"" led by the legendary outlaw Billy the kid go to war in this classic western.",10,22 August 2013,"I have not seen a lot of westerns so I don't pretend to be some expert on western movies. However this is without a doubt one of the best westerns of all-time and my favorite western of all-time. I know some people criticize this film for not being historically accurate or a shallow attempt to be a ""hip"" western. Well, the truth is this film is not 100% accurate with history but what movie is? I liked the idea of this being a hip western staring Hollywood's ""brat pack"" with rock music playing in the background. I think it fits because this is basically a story about Billy the kid, a outlaw who was under 20 years old so it makes sense to give this one a younger or hipper feel to it. I like the Billy the kid story and I've seen many movies about him but this is the best one for 3 reasons. 1: I liked that they started from the beginning, other films focus on the ""later"" years when he met Pat Garret. 2: I like that this is more about the gang and not just about Billy. 3: Emilio Estevez is the best Billy the kid. I think the story is very well done, it's the best depiction of the Lincoln county war in New Mexico and the changes made were for the better. Like in real life John Tunstall was only twenty something and their were about a dozen or so ""regulaters"" not just the 6 shown here but the changes made worked for the better. The film is well directed by Chris Cain with a great balance of action, humor and is appropriately violent. I also like the look of the film, it really makes you feel like their in the wild west during 1878 and not on some sound stage. It also has a great cast! With the great Terrance Stamp who's perfectly cast as John Tunstall, an older English man who takes in six young rebellious men to work at his cattle ranch. The villain is the always great Jack Palance as Murphy, who kills Tunstal, starting the war. The 6 young boys search for justice so they become sheriffs but thanks to Billy killing everyone who they're supposed to arrest, they become outlaws. I LOVE Emillio Estevez as Billy the Kid. I know many would say his interpretation is not historically accurate but I think it's much more the way we would like to imagine the kid. Emillio gives one of his best performances and he was cheated out of an Oscar nomination. I think they did a great job in blending a lot of color to the kid. Billy is a lot of things in this movie, he's cocky, rebellious, trigger-happy, a little crazy, a loyal friend, and charming. Billy is perfectly portrayed as an anti-hero like he should be. Emillio always makes him likable even if we know he's a little crazy. I do like how they make Billy a little crazy as he takes pleasure in killing his enemies. His kills are marked by his unforgettable giggle, I love Emillio's lunatic sounding laugh. Billy is fearless who enjoys the thrill of life or death situations. But despite his wild behavior he's extremely loyal to his friends which gives him a lot of heart. Kiefer Sutherland is great as the more sensitive ""Doc"", one of my favorite performances of his. I love Lou Diamond Phillips as Chavez Y Chavez, possibly his best role and I love his knife skills. Dermot Mulloney is great as ""dirty"" Steve and he has a lot of funny moments. Casey Siemasko is great as Charlie, the more scared one of the bunch. I love Charlie Sheen as Dick, the appointed leader of the gang. I like how he fought for leadership of the regulators with his real life brother Emillio as Billy. I like the name of the gang as ""the regulators"", that's a cool name. The film has non stop action, good humor, good characters and the theme of friendship works well here.I love the rock'n'roll theme music. I like that they show Emillio/Billy take the now famous Billy the kid picture as well. One of my favorite movies of all-time.",Young Guns

79,ridiculonius,The Best Western Ever,9,21 December 2008,"Let it be known that I hate westerns as a rule. I'm sorry, but I can't stand them. Most of them (for me) have the same tiresome plots, the basis of which are always some so-called ""good"" character goes out to kill some so-called ""bad"" character (both characters are, on an added note, incredibly unlikeable). The whole movie is often tied together by scenes of unending gunfire, in which people (who you think are important but you can't be sure) are shot dead without ceremony and left there while the ""good"" character reaps the reward. I cannot abide westerns. So, when my mum finally convinced me to see Young Guns, I was (despite the presence of Keifer Sutherland) determined to despise it.Well, I finally found the best western. And it is this.Young Guns follows the story of William ""Billy the Kid"" Bonny (Emilio Estavez) and the gang of Regulators he was the pseudo-leader of during the Lincoln County War. The Regulators, which include(d) Josiah ""Doc"" Surlock (Keifer Sutherland), Richard ""Dick"" Brewer (Charlie Sheen), and Jose Chavez Y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips), all wanted revenge for the cold-blooded murder of their friend and mentor, John Tunstall. Having been deputized via a friend of Tunstall's, Alex McSween, the Regulators were admitted to kill certain men in their vendetta. After Billy's reckless slaughtering of folk not permitted to be slaughtered, the Regulators were branded outlaws, and became part of a county-wide manhunt that eventually led them to a final showdown with Tunstall's killers.A movie that is about friendship and politics just as much as it is about gunslinging, Young Guns is touching, exciting, and much more humorous than any western I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that makes you smile at the end of it, an ending which is bittersweet and moving. Estavez's Billy the Kid is a slightly psychotic, annoying yet strangely likable anti-hero with a strong sense of loyalty that makes him the most interesting character in the movie. The Regulators, though coarse and somewhat awkward in their social abilities, are all quite affable in their own way, and you really get to care about them.Overall, Young Guns is not only a terrific western, but a terrific movie. While riddled with clichés and deep-down-but-not-so-far-from-the-surface messages, it still retains enough dignity to have true heart.9/10",Young Guns

Emilio Estevez is great at the part of Billy the Kid and there's a lot of action and gunfights in it.  Estevez also brings in some humor in the movie.  Brian Keith did good in his role as the old man who guns down Charlie Sheen and he probably had the funniest part in the movie. Just imagine being so calm in shooting at 6 guys who are armed as well.  I felt such excitement at the end when Estevez jumped out of the chest where he was hiding in and shooting like a maniac at the corrupt lawmen.  All six characters, with the exception of lean, calm Charlie Sheen, live up to the tagline on the cover of the movie; Six reasons why the West was wild.

The task of Billy is given to Emilio Estevez and Charlie Sheen, Keifer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Dermont Mulroney and Casey Siemaszko as his friends or as they are know in the film and in real life the ""Regulators"". In terms of plot the film is loosly made around history as it was although some parts never actually happened. However the key part of the film is the acting which is one well considering the cast is quite young.Estevez plays Billy well, and shows him as the houmouerous character that Billy has was known for all those 100 years ago. However all Billy the kidd films portray him as a trigger happy short tempered man, dispite historical documents that prove other wise.Despite its historical errors (which are made possibly to make the film better/ more exciting) *like there being around 15 regulators at the fight at the McSween house, and some of the characters getting killed when it actually never happened.

87,AndrewWalker747,more than a western,10,20 October 2001,"SPOILERS Watching this movie 10 years ago when I was a kid, the only thing I really remembered was the shootouts.  But after watching it again this summer, you really get an appreciation for the characters and the unfairness and hardships that their lives became.  Watching the movie, you really sympathize with these orphans and the friendship and bonding that they go through. A good example is Dirty Steve and Chavez.  Two guys who hated each other in the beginning and by the end are almost like brothers after what they went through together.  Did you notice in the last shootout that Chavez got away and Steve died because Steve gave him his horse and told him to go? Another example is when Chavez was going to walk out on the posse after telling the guys the fate of his family with the U.S. army, but then Billy tells him ""were your family now, you got 4 or 5 good pals, then you got yourself a tribe,aint nothing stronger than that, you desert us then you brake our sacred hoop.""Character change was also big in this movie, if you really noticed.  Take Billy for example.  Look at his two different meetings with pat garret. the first one he is awed by Garrets size and then says ""im gonna be as big as him someday, no ill be bigger.""  The second meeting at Charlie's wedding, Billie is much more stronger against Garrett and threatens him with his pistol.  this is after Billie has become the most wanted man in New Mexico. and speaking of Charlie, he went from a kid so afraid of dying to being absoloutely trigger happy in the last shootout when he takes on John Kinney, the bounty-hunter he feared the most, and takes down Kinney before he falls too.To be general, this movie is much more than a shoot-em-up western (although the gunfights were absoloutely fantastic).  The characters were brialliant and well-portrayed.  Especially Emilio Estevez who was hilarious as Billy the Kid (""yeah i seen Red Smitty hang, I see his head come clean off, it was a hell of a sight!"" and ""Pippin, Charlie Crawford aint with you anymore!)

88,Challenger2013,One of the Most Underrated Westerns Ever,9,14 June 2015,"Here is one of the most underrated Western films of all time. What we have here is the untold story of ""The Regulators,"" led by the infamous Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez). The film follows the group of six young men (none of them over 21 years old, but they all look like they're 25 or 30.) The story is quite simple; their guardian is murdered, and they are deputized to find the suspects and bring them in. When Billy goes on a killing spree of the murderers, the boys are on the run from the law themselves.The great effect of this film is how it mixes exciting Western action with comedy and boyish charm. Each actor plays their part as it is meant to be played, nothing special but still exceptional. Each character also has their defining traits that make them individually likable. One of the most lovable is Doc (Kiefer Sutherland) who is great with the steel, but also claims to be a poet, even though all of his poems are slightly tweaked versions of classic poems by acclaimed authors. Lastly, we are given a wonderful, almost-evil villain played wonderfully by the Western legend, Jack Palance.This film, being made just before the 1990s, contains new comedic elements for the genre, but is also quite relatable to the classic, beloved Westerns of earlier decades. It doesn't look like other 1980s films aesthetically; it looks more like a technicolor 1950s Western, and it is very refreshing. The film is not necessarily under-watched by Western fans, but does not receive the acclaim it deserves. It's easily one of the most fun Westerns of the last three or four decades.",Young Guns

92,AVass0812,New Western that's entertaining...,6,18 October 2002,"Recently I viewed the DVD version of the 1988 western ""Young Guns"". I have to admit, that 12 years since this film was released, I still enjoyed watching it. This film does not appear dated, except for the realization that just about everyone in the film (with the exception of Keifer Sutherland) has managed to pretty much ""six gun"" their acting careers into oblivion. The film, set in the late 19th century old west, depicts the story of the Billy the Kidd and his loosely knitted gang of ""Regulators"" dispensing justice on those who killed their gallant British (and extremely boring) leader played by Terrance Booth, who seemed to have a fancy to ""young guns""...not too far from the real truth? I liked this film for the fact that it copied the the formula that made so many of the spaghetti and b-rated westerns a huge success. Guns, bad guys in black, more guns, Cowboys and Indians, old west...and guns.I had totally forgot the cameos of Jack Palance & Brian Keith (Uncle Bill from Family Affair)who were in it. I guess Charlie Sheen's role was just a little more than cameo, but close too it. This film is worth watching, especially if you've never seen it before or if its been a long time (like my experience) since watching it. I assure that it won't be a waste of 90 minutes.",Young Guns
93,Jonthan22,"Fun, action romp",7,23 February 2006,"Young Guns, is a fun western adventure, buzzing with energy. It tells the story of William H. Bonney (aka Billy the Kid), as he sets out to right the injustice done to himself and his friends when their employer and mentor is murdered by a business rival.Young Guns works as a Western and as an action movie, and its ensemble of young actors (hence the title Young Guns) should be enough to entertain the young audience as well as the western buffs.Emilio Estevez (Freejack, Stakeout) heads the gang of Young Guns, as the Kid, arguably his finest performance to date. Estevez portrays the Kid as a c0cky, slightly crazy young man, who loves the thrill of the chase and lives for the excitement of gun fire and danger.Kiefer Sutherland (24, The Lost Boys) is Doc Skurlock, the level head of the group and an intellectual romantic.Lou Diamond Phillips is the enigmatic half Indian, half Mexican Chavez.Charlie Sheen is Richard Brewer, the patriarch of the group who is constantly at odds with the kids brash and reckless behaviour.Dermot Mulroney is ""Dirty"" Steve, the tobacco chewing, shotgun wielding hillbilly.And Casey Sziemasko is the sensitive pugilist Charlie Bowdre, who really does not realise how deep he is in with the Kid.Together they are ""The Regulators"" and they are seeking revenge for the murder of their boss John Tunstall (Terence Stamp) at the hands of rival cattle farmer,Irishman Murphy (played by Jack Palance, at home as the leering villain like always). The movie exudes energy right from the start and the score helps a great deal. The actors each give a decent performance and this version of the Billy the Kid legend (Whilst not 100% accurate) is probably the closest thing we will ever see to the truth regarding the story of Billy the Kid. Of course the purely fictional Young Guns II tore all that down but hey, this is Hollywood.A great movie!",Young Guns
94,Mankind-6,Where have you gone Emilio Estevez ?,2,13 December 2003,"So it's not a great movie... and the acting is not the best from most of the main players, except for Kiefer Sutherland who truly is great no matter the script he gets.  Heck, even his MCI commercials are well acted.  I did however enjoy it... and would recommend it for a few laughs...",Young Guns
95,jhammond59,History is shot down once again,7,3 May 2006,"I was somewhat surprised to see the Lincoln County War portrayed as accurately as it was, even though there were a number of historical inaccuracies. Since I'm doing extensive research on the Lincoln County War for a novel about same, I expected to gag often at historical lapses, but the screenplay by John Fusco stays reasonably close to the historical record. Of course the historical record has produced many conflicting interpretations as I soon discovered.The choice to make Billy a psychopathic killer, whether by Emilio Estevez's interpretation or the director's is not well supported by historical facts, but Emilio's insane giggle after each killing strongly suggests it.In the context of the times, within a lawless county that at the time was as large as Connecticutt, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont combined, men often settled things with a gun and violence, and Billy was definitely a product of those times.One glaring mistake, and one made often in Billy the Kid movies was John Tunstall's real age, which was 24, not 55 as Terrence Stamp (I'm being charitable) appears to be in the film. While Billy was loyal to the man that gave him honest work, I don't think he'd be perceived as a father figure. Nonetheless, the scene at Tunstall's home where he asks Billy to read for him did portray the fact he was quite literate as his letters to Gov. Wallace prove.The scene where Billy kills Henry Hill in the outhouse is pure fabrication. There was a Tom Hill that rode with Jessie Evans, but he was killed later by an Cherokee Indian when Tom and Jessie tried to rob a sheep drover, John Wagner. Legend did have Billy responsible, but most accounts tagged the notorious Jessie Evans for that mishap.The Five Day Battle, one of the most famous in the west, was done reasonable well. Col Dudley did get involved in the fray, and brought a six pounder howitzer and a Gatling Gun with him. His intent, while he denied it was to ""even the odds"", which meant to give the Murphy-Dolan gang a 2 to 1 advantage. However, the gun was NOT used to kill McSween, but to intimidate McSween's men housed in two other buildings in Lincoln.McSween was killed trying to escape the conflagration, but had waited too long after Billy led a diversion to draw their fire. Many of the soldiers were shown also firing at the McSween home, but little evidence supports that possibility. However, Dudley's positioning of his men alongside Dolan's made it impossible for McSweens's men to return fire for fear of hitting a soldier that would have resulted in Dudley firing his cannon and Gatling Gun.Also, on this point, the soldiers of Fort Stanton would have been hard pressed not to get involved with all the guns going off. These were battle tested veterans, many of whom knew Murphy and Dolan as they both were mustered out at Fort Stanton, and Murphy had a store at the fort years earlier and no doubt got drunk with some of them.The character of L. G. Murphy was perfectly cast with Jack Palance. You never had any doubt this was a bad dude. However, at the time of the battle, Murphy suffered from Cancer of the bowels, and was singlehandedly drinking up his saloon's profits. Dolan was by then the man in charge, and an even nastier man than his ex-boss.The one point of departure that had me completely aghast was the needless peyote scene. Unless, true to the times, we had to have a ""drug scene"", where were they going with this? Others have commented on the music, and I must say, when playing the DVD in its intro mode, the replaying of that dreadful song is enough to make one hit the mute button. One of the extras that I appreciated is a documentary of Billy the Kid, which does correct some of the deviations in the movie.One place they did get things right was in the characterization of Buckshot Roberts by the late Brian Keith, one of my favorites. Buckshot got his name from a load of same that shattered his shoulder making it impossible for him to raise his rifle above his waist and Keith mimicked that perfectly.There were other inaccuracies to be sure, but I have covered the most glaring. And of course most of you are not watching this as western history, I trust. Faults aside, this is still one of the most realistic and accurate portraits of the 1870's in New Mexico.",Young Guns

98,indurain,Not a bad movie until the end,5,2 May 2013,"At the end of the movie, Billy and his gang are holed up in the house of their lawyer which is completely surrounded by hundreds of lawmen, bounty hunters, and the U.S Army. Even Doc says ""Billy we're good, but this is getting ridiculous."".After the house is set on fire, Chavez escapes and somehow sneaks right past the men outside. Billy and his gang exit the house guns a blazin' right in front of a Gatling gun the Army has brought which mysteriously is not used. Chavez rides back with 3 horses, rides right through the men outside, jumps the horses over a barricade, and Billy and Doc somehow manage to mount the horses and ride right through the men down the street with not one shot fired.Then to top it all off, the lawyer emerges from the house and the Army pumps about 100 bullets into him with the same Gatling gun that for some reason they didn't use on Billy and his gang. It gets better, Billy then rides back, stops in the middle of the street, pops a cap into Murphy, and then rides off with no shots fired at him. Of course the gang then just rides off into the sunset, why would the US Army bother to pursue?This was a ridiculous, unbelievable ending and completely ruined the entire movie.",Young Guns
99,the_stiff_meister,Good Western,7,24 November 2006,"Jon Tunstall (Terence Stamp) is an English cattleman who takes in outlaws to help him on his farm and help them prepare for a life in the new world as well as putting a roof over their heads.In this group there is mild mannered Doc (Kiefer Sutherland in a brilliant performance) Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips in his best performance to date) as well as Charlie Sheen, Dermot Mulroney and Casey Siemasko they are band calling themselves the regulators competing against rivalman L.G Murphy (Jack Palance in a terribly underrated performance) for land and power Into this war enters Billy (Emilio Estevez in an awesome performance) he fits in well with the rest of the regulators and gets on with Tunstall.Tunstall is brutally murdered forcing the regulators from their home they are deputized by Tunstall's lawyer Alex McSween (Terry O Quinn) hoping to bring justice to those who killed Tunstall and one day getting to Murphy who ordered the killing.This is where Billy's wild side comes out and Estevex really has fun playing him he takes the regulators authority too far and they soon become the hunted.Its a bit of a slow start but after the death of Tunstall it really picks up speed its non stop action and thrills right to the end with gunslinging a plenty and lots of huge gunfights and deaths the setting is a brilliant typical wild west setting and is brillaintly detailed with lots of cool starsApart from the action and carnage the other huge strength here is the acting Emilio Estevez is pretty much an evil good guy as really gets into the character, Kiefer Sutherland is more subtle and polite and not a very violent person, Lou Diamond Phillips character is a typical hardman he plays the role very well, Charlie Sheen's character Richard ""Dick"" Brewer is my favourite out of the lot even if he isn't in the film as much as the others (he dies quite early in) its still a good performance So overall i would hugley recommend this film to Western fans, Action junkies (even a touch of romance) or just people who like a good film you will not be disappointed however it lacks a little as it is not very rewatchable but from time to time give it a try and cheer yourself up 8/10 8/10",Young Guns

Also alot of powerful words n teachings in this film. Spiritual and deep in ways. Pals !! Alot of powerful quotes. I love this movie. I was born in 1987 and grew up watching this in the 90s with my brothers, my pals. We had little figurines like gi joes of these characters. It was so cool. I re watched this movie in jan 2021 after not seeing it since 90s and it was as entertaining as ever. Kept me glued the whole time. The music is terrific bc its made in the 80s. This is an all time classic and will stand up to the ages. Doesnt need fancy cgi to be awesome, gotta love that. Emilio plays billy the kid in a phenomenal way, i cant imagine anyone else playing this role as good. All the main characters n supportative cast all do great job acting as well. A bunch of different personalities but all great acting n very realistic and all those diff personalities = pals. Thw regulators! Mount up !! I encourage you to watch and its not too dirty to good for children 6+ to watch i think too. Enjoy !! Young guns 2 is just as good. Its One of the few sequals which is as good as first movie....also, i was fortunate enough to visit the town of Lincoln, nm in 2016. Being a young guns fan made it such a cool experience.

103,hitzendegen,Good for the action !,5,20 December 2011,"This movie is watchable. The best performing actor by a mile is Jack Palance, making much out of a shallow character. From the younger bunch (Lou Diamond Philips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Casey Siemaszko, Dermut Mulroney and Emilio Estevez) only the last one is worth mentioning as rather decent. The plot is predictable all the way even if you are not very familiar with Billy the Kid. Talking history, don't expect to pick up anything from history. Movies are not the best place to learn history and this one doesn't make an exception. The soundtrack is not very exciting either. So what make it watchable ? The settings are really quality. In every scene you can feel a bit of that dust and the desert-like weather. And the action. If you take some of your precious time to spend on ""Young Guns"", you are not looking for some mind-boggling drama, are you ? There are many sequences of shooting, bloodshed, revenge and quarry. That's the best of it. If you consider yourself thin-skinned, don't even bother to watch. Apart from some nonsensical dialogs, a dislocated speech here and there to give you some ""history"", it boils down to guns going off. And it won't let you down in this very aspect. The accents are another annoyance. But what disappoints immensely is Charlie Sheen, whose awfulness kills his character into the first 30 minutes. It is a blessing. And his movie career didn't actually take off. Go figure !5 out of 10",Young Guns

107,jim_ruuth,Regulators... Mount Up!,10,30 May 2017,"The movie is (loosely) based on Billy the Kid's adventures during the Lincoln County War, that took place in 1877-1878. The movie has this brat pack feeling to it. filled with fast action scenes and snappy one liners.The brat pack of gunmen consists of Billy the Kid (Emilio Estevez), Dick Brewer (Charlie Sheen), Dirty Steve (Dermot Mulroney), Doc Scurlock (Kiefer Sutherland), Chavez y Chavez (Lou Diamond Phillips) and Charley Bowdre (Casey Siemaszko). These young men are a bunch of misfits and gunmen that are gathered under the guidance of English cattle rancher John Tunstall (Terence Stamp). They work and protect his ranch and economic interests and John Tunstall gives the young gunmen food, shelter and an education in return. The movies main villain is the Irishman Lawrence G. Murphy (played by western movie veteran Jack Palance), whom also is a rancher and merchant and the natural rival to John Tunstall. The rivalry goes bad and John Tunstall is murdered and the movie turns into a tale of revenge. Billy the Kid's gang is deputised after meeting lawyer Alexander McSween (Terry O'Quinn). They were young and inexperienced but they were the only men with guts enough to challenge the terror of Lawrence Murphy, whom had a huge gang following him. The young gunmen takes on the name The Regulators as they ride out to arrest some of the murderers in Murhpy's gang. But hot-headed Billy wants instant justice and starts to murder his enemies and the Regulators are stripped of their badges. Despite becoming outlaws the Regulators keep hunting down Murphy's men while bounty hunters and law men are closing in on them. The movie is filled with cool and creative shooting scenes, the dialogue is fast and saucy and often really memorable. The movie has a fast pace and there if the movie had been directed by Peter Jackson it would have been 3 times 3 hours long. Young Guns is more fun than your old John Wayne / Clint Eastwood movies. Funny fact is that: Pat Garrett is played by John Wayne's son Patrick Wayne.The cast is brilliant and Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Jack Palance and Emilio Estevez does some of their best work of their careers. The movie doesn't go deep and rarely scratches the surface and at times the dialogue feels more cool than realistic. This western has everything, it's an adventure, it has comedic elements, it's action and it has even got some romance in it. The movie is about friendship and going against the odds as the men keep challenging themselves to grow. It's a very entertaining movie, It doesn't compare to some of the old Spaghetti westerns out there but it doesn't try either. Young guns was a new brand of Western that we hadn't really seen before. It doesn't follow the real story of Billy the Kid correctly either. There are some fabrications of the truth here and there, but Young Guns come in all guns blazing and it does it with a big grin on it's face. The movie came out when the Western genre was more or less dead and buried, but the movie did pretty well despite scoring bad reviews and it helped revitalise the dead genre a bit. I've seen more than 100 western movies in my days but I still think that this is the most exciting western movie out there, maybe not the best but definitely one of the few that I can watch over and over again. Movie fans... Mount Up!",Young Guns

I don't see a movie analyzing the historical accuracy, nor do I expect more than I get, something no one should do except they wish to find spots of bother. To me, Young Guns is a film with a good plot, fine actors, interesting characters and nice messages such as the importance of friendship. Furthermore, it takes people to a universe, be it ""real"" or not, which is filled with wonders and excitements, opening a little window to what we call imagination. Luckily, no boundaries are set to it and we can dream away just like a filmmaker can portray his vision. It's lucky we don't need to take movie critics too seriously, not if a film touches our hearts and we care about it, because it's become part of our memories, therefore our lives. I don't need anyone telling me what to like and what not to like. Young Guns is thrilling, exciting and nicely done in all aspects. That is all one needs to know. Every western fan should have seen it. Movie critics or even buffs who're not into westerns should busy themselves with other things and take it easy.

The plot of the film is Billy the kid and his band of regulators off on a revenge path on the gang that killed Tunstall. It's probably the type of movie people can eat popcorn to and have a good time but also has a lot of heart. I would recommend Young Guns to pretty much anybody, even those who aren't western fans.

114,poison-8,You really should see this film!,10,27 May 2000,"Young Guns is one of the best films I have ever seen. The script is cleverly written and there are scenes which will make you cry, make you laugh, make you shiver with excitement, and make you hate certain characters. These superbly written scenes are delivered by a perfect cast, with exceptional acting from Emilio Estevez and Lou Diamond Phillips in particular. The film focuses on the Lincoln County War, paying particular attention to the part played by the Regulators in this war. The Regulators and the few people on their side are shown in a positive light, and other parties involved are shown in a negative light. I believe this film is an accurate representation of the war and of those involved. I strongly recommend this outstanding film to everyone, whatever your interests, this film is a must see. If you have already seen this film but have not yet seen it's equally brilliant follow up 'Young Guns II' then you really should do, the sequel does this film justice.A final note, if you are sensitive or emotional, here's a word of warning- tissues may be needed!",Young Guns

116,cliffcovenant75,LACKLUSTER AND PURPOSELESS,1,19 October 2018,"When ""Young Guns"" was first released I was 13 years old. I have inherited a love for westerns from my father however I never had the desire to watch it then and never had actually watched it until now some 30 years later. I had seen the trailer several times but it failed to grab my interest.I am always looking for good westerns to watch and I came across ""Young Guns"" recently and thought it was about time to see it. My suspicions have been proven right. It is not a good movie in my opinion and I have not missed anything these past 30 years.My first impression was that it may have been merely made as a vehicle to showcase the talents of the young actors who star in it. I will admit that they do play there parts really well despite the strange pace and insipid feel of the film. As we all know a few of them have gone on to be quite formidable actors who deserve our respect.Secondly the film has no heart. I did not feel emotionally invested in anyone, except maybe in Doc who Kiefer Sutherland really makes stand out from the rest. Also it seems as if the film makers are trying to present Emelio Estevez's Billy, clearly a psychopath, as a hero. Very strange! True William Bonnie was a conflicted, complex individual, however to give him a subtle heroic, integrity in the film has no purpose, except to perhaps get a message across that even psychopaths are good guys. In fact the lines between good and evil are so drastically blurred in this film that it is pretty much impossible to find anybody likeable. When they all got shot up in the end I was glad to see the last of them, not just Murphy, although some of the young guns did survive the battle. There was no sense of victory or closure to the story. It was almost as if it was trying hard to be like The Magnificent Seven, just without the sense of those who had died having nobly given their lives for the well-being of others.This brings me to the last issue I have with the film. What was it's purpose? What point was being put across? I draw a blank there! A superficial revenge tail that seems to be nothing more than an overlong music video (please take note of the score-80's syth rock for a western?!?).Everyone has something they want to say. Film makers express themselves through film. I like to listen to people communicate and put a point across. I may not agree with what they say but at least it has clarity. I hate listening to someone talk for a few hours who has not made one clear point. I feel exactly the same about ""Young Guns""",Young Guns

Many a film on Billy the Kid I have seen where Billy, 21, has been played by middle aged men!

The rest of the cast is good also although Dick shouldn't have died as fast as he did after all he was a credited character in the movie and he died within the first half hour of the show. Lou Diamon Philips did well but was better in LaBamba. Keifer should have went right into detective shows since he's best at those in mopo.

Although I'm more used to seeing him playing vampires and eccentric doctor types I was not disappointed. Not only did Sutherland make an excellent cowboy, suave and courageous at the same time, but the film also had Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estivez, which gave it even more appeal (to me anyway). This film proved to me that Sutherland, Sheen and Estivez are capable of so much more than the ""cheesy"" horrors and the ""laugh a minute comedies"" that they've been in and in the future I won't be so quick to stereotype actors.I found the film itself to be really enjoyable. Not the blood baths that I'm accustomed to, but all that gun slinging and revenge was brilliant all the same. It was also humorous in a way that you wouldn't expect from a Western.

The action is explosive, and for the most part, the movie shares a lot of similarities with the legendary Billy The Kid and his gang.

After seeing it I went out and looked up anything I could on Billy the Kid. And from what I've read this movie (for the most part)is true the man and the myth.",Young Guns
125,Tykeyla_Gold,Excellent!!,10,30 June 2002,"I love this movie!!It's the best western movie I've seen.They start off hating each other,then they begin to realize how much they needed each other.""I think now,looking back,we didn't fight the enemy,we fought ourselves.The enemy was in us.The war is over for me now,but,it will always be there,the rest of my days.As I'm sure Elias will be,fighting with Barnes,for what Rhah called""possesion of my soul.""   Charlie Sheen As Chris Taylor in Platoon(1986)",Young Guns
126,stlveg,Well worth seeing,10,17 August 2002,"Young Guns is very entertaining, not just another western. Character development is superb with excellent performances by all the actors. Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Charlie Sheen and Lou Diamond Phillips play off of each other very well. The relationship between Estevez as Billy and Sutherland as Doc provide for some very funny moments in spite of the fact that the overall tone of the movie is fairly intense.  The violence and language definitely make this movie inappropriate for young children.",Young Guns
127,rvwageningen,Waste of time,3,11 January 2003,"For an action film it was too ridiculous. For a drama it was to unreal. For a comedy it wasn't funny enough. And then the actors did a bad job, as did the scenario writer. Indeed, watching this movie was a complete waste of time. But then again, you learn to appreciate other westerns better after you've seen this one.",Young Guns
128,sherry03,Young Guns Rocks,10,17 May 2004,"I thought that Young Guns was an absolutely amazing movie and a lot of great and talented actors such as Emilio Estevez. I find that it puts the spotlight more on the outlaws changing people's point of view on them and really giving them a chance to shine and show that they're not all ""bad."" I especially like the way it defines the character of Billy the kid as not just someone who killed a lot of people but someone with a life and goals, more of a real person. I like the way it made him more of a real determined character and it really made me feel sorry for him when at the end it said that he was killed in the dark with no weapon and in my opinion the people who killed him is a coward. I like the fact that after he is dead it makes him seem like a good person which is something he deserves. I thought that movie was an absolutely amazing, inspiring film and if you haven't seen it , i strongly suggest you do.",Young Guns
129,roythetoy1,Top Five All Time Westerns,9,13 September 2005,"It just doesn't get much better than this. Extremely well acted by all main characters. I highly recommend this movie. It's the kind of movie you can watch time and time again and never tire of it. Emilio Estevez is one of my favorite actors since seeing him in Young Guns. He comes from a family of top notch movie star stock. His Father, Charlie Sheen and brother Charlie Sheen. Generally speaking I'm not much of a western movie fan, however Young Guns, Tombstone, Forgiven,and all Clint Eastwood westerns. Emilio Estevez captures the Billy the Kid character and makes it his own. After watching his version, I can't imagine any other Billy the Kid version.",Young Guns
130,ca-cavalier2009,Awesome!,10,4 September 2005,"I can't even describe to you in words how much I love this movie. It's simplicity is what makes it truly great. How every character is portrayed is unique and very well done. I have seen this movie many times and I love it every time I see it. My friend Lisa and I are huge fans and continue to be huge fans. When Murphy is killed in the final battle by Billy I was in awe at how well it was done. I was saddened to see Charlie, Steve , and Alex go but I was floored at how heroic they died. Chavez is my favorite character because of how complex his character is. His tainted past made my heart ache and I was filled with grief. This is my opinion on the movie, I hope it kind of helped.",Young Guns
131,russelljeffords,"Keith as archetype, what Lincoln County really was",7,17 January 2006,"As an oldster who enjoys current films despite the ""noise"" often selected as soundtracks, it is also often sad to see what roles old actors must take to keep food on the table. Thus the appearance of Oliver Hardy in ""The Kentuckian"" or Henry Fonda as a real bad guy in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". The role I remember most is that of Brian Keith, as the aging mountain man. As most know, he, like John Wayne, died of cancer. I imagine that this role, like that of JW in ""The Shootist"", was an affirmation that the way to go out of a life is With Sand. It is not only 19th century weapons that are or may be inaccurate; many a gun battle these days feature 1000 shots and only one hit--you'll remember one of those school shootings where this happened at ten feet. As for Lincoln County, this was the westernmost part of Texas stolen from us in 1853. Bo matter what you call the fight, it's Texans (and Confederate-philic) Regulators against the carpetbaggers in power.",Young Guns
