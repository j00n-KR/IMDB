0,nogodnomasters,I read articles on body language.,5,13 March 2020,Norval Greenwood (Elijah Wood) visits his estranged father (Stephen McHattie) who deserted the family when Norval was 5 years old. It has been 30 years. Norval discovers his father to be an abusive drunk not knowing why he was invited to his remote coastal home in the first place. About 50 minutes into the films things become very twisty as we watch a different film.The film was not overwhelming. I didn't care for any of the characters who were all heavily flawed and lacked charisma.Guide: F-word. Nudity,Come to Daddy
1,kosmasp,Daddy dearest,8,9 March 2020,"They say it's best not to meet your idols ... sometimes that is true with your dad too. Especially if he wasn't a part of your life. But how do you know, what kind of person he is, if you've never met him? And how do you deal with him, once you meet him? Do you even want to meet him? There are a lot of things that seem weird here, and McHattie is perfect choice for the character he's portraying - in every scene he's involved.Having said that, there are other actors too and they are really good. Technically good and a story with enough twists to keep you occupied and at the edge of your seat. This is fun and scary, what more does one need?",Come to Daddy
2,deloudelouvain,"Slow start, strong finish. Much better then expected.",8,11 July 2020,"Come To daddy was not really what I expected, it's actually much better then I thought it would be. It's a bit of a slow burner in the beginning, makes you wondering where they're going to with this already enjoyable story. The second half on the other hand is definitely in another gear, with some pretty looking brutal scenes. I thought the tension building was perfect, you can't stop watching once the plot unfolds. Good acting from the whole cast, with an Elijah Wood that proves he can do something else than playing a Hobbit. Good directing from Ant Timpson and very good writing from Toby Harvard. I'll definitely keep an eye on those two. If their future work is of the same level it can only be good.",Come to Daddy
3,christopher-underwood,not short on excruciating violence or colourful language,7,1 September 2020,"This is well made and put together with decent performances. Its just that nothing about it really appealed to me. I didn't take to any of the characters and found myself finding fault with their choices and actions. Admittedly it takes some unexpected turns and is never predictable but I found I really didn't care too much. For me the wrong character dies at the start and things never really got back. On the extras there is an interview by the guy that used to help out at London's Cinema Store back in the day and a short film from the director of this feature. This impressive short shows well enough that Ant Timson has great skills and a wonderful cinema eye, even if rather influenced by Eraserhead, so maybe it was just me having an off night. Certainly not short on excruciating violence or colourful language.",Come to Daddy
4,thesar-2,"Come, Take the Edge Off",5,4 June 2020,"Sounds more like a gay porn to me. And, yet, maybe?I think this film REALLY wanted to be edgy. Maybe the next Tarantino film. While still good, original and interesting to stay through the end, it failed at being the next indie-darling.An odd, sorta 70s porn star-looking Elijah Wood stars as a struggling adult artist travelling to a fantastic home to (insert Film Title Mission here) and when it's not what it's cut out to be, six more sinister subplots appear.I appreciate they're trying to be creative and cultured, but there's just too little time here to explore. It almost felt like a dark cinematic universe and when it was over, I was looking forward to parts 2-4. Unfortunately, this is all we got.At least there were plenty of full-frontal male nudity scenes to enjoy, some snappy dialogue and a hilarious front desk clerk - easily the best character in a movie with so few characters.***Final thoughts: I'm no filmmaker, but seriously, I would've condensed this entire movie to 20 minutes and then add 3-4 more 20-minute chapters and made the best art-house film since Pulp Fiction. Instead, we just got a so-so, yet still entertaining, student film.",Come to Daddy
5,westsideschl,Started Well,4,18 June 2020,"First 20 min or so I was going to rate this higher, but as it went on it's rating started to fall. Characters from the estranged son & supposed dad along with the behavior of all others didn't come across as real. Lots of four letter obscenities to fill a dialogue that was going nowhere. Brief action scenes also yawning unbelievable. Lack of attention to detail, e.g. character not locking steel trap door; using the being used car trunk to hide in; Calif. zip code with 555 movie area code with location either in Mich. or Ontario with address in Portland and non-existent bus company; filmed on Vancouver Island, Canada. Pointless, awkward attempt at serendipity w/tiger toy; tiger plastic bag; large tiger sign. That's what happens when New Zealand, Ireland, Canada, US create a disjointed unreal script.",Come to Daddy
6,nairtejas,"50% Hilarity and Crime, 50% Dullness / 5 Stars",5,1 September 2020,"Nothing much happens in the first 50 minutes of Come to Daddy, a black comedy with shades of crime that sees Elijah Wood's character come to meet his father after he receives a letter from him. Things go wrong after the 50th minute and the film packs a punch with its hilarious jokes, sudden jerk-like action, and subtle background score. I enjoyed Wood's performance, and in a character's words, I agree that he has kind eyes. It's short and it's passable LOL material to watch with friends. TN.",Come to Daddy
7,UniqueParticle,Super weird/eerie vibes,7,10 October 2020,I'm unsure what to think except it's creepy and bizarre in multiple parts. Elijah Wood is definitely great in horror or super just playing as weird characters! The sounds and awkward interactions are enough to be scary plus it gets brutal. Come to Daddy is better than I expected at least to some extent!,Come to Daddy
8,Tweetienator,Crashed Somewhere in the Grey,5,2 May 2020,"The whole cast, especially Elijah Wood fit well into their shoes and are the best part of Come to Daddy, but, and this is a great but, after half or so of the running time the story loses its momentum, and I got slightly bored - the more and more cruel and ugly scenes couldn't disguise the fact that the story took some twist too much and (in my opinion) a rather boring turn. I would have preferred some evil spirit or satanic cult, or maybe just a father-son drama/conflict like the movie started. Anyway, the acting is good and you may dare to give it a try, especially if you like to watch Mr. Wood.",Come to Daddy
9,Fella_shibby,"Well acted, hilarious n brutal at times. Well, a pen is indeed mightier than the sword.",7,15 March 2020,"A musician from Beverly Hills receives a letter from his estranged father asking him to come and visit him in his secluded cabin overlooking a lake n surrounded by woods.
As audience we suspect that something is not right after the phone calls, but trust me the film is not at all predictable. It is very hilarious n well acted. Elijah Wood gave a good performance and Michael Smiley is hilarious with his ultimate weapons, a pen n a crossbow.
The film is a bit slow in the beginning but picks up n then doesn't let go. I was laughing my guts out.
I didn't like the director's Greasy Strangler. Found it gross n offensive. But this movie is less gross n more comedic.",Come to Daddy
10,marmar-69780,come to daddy,6,4 March 2020,"Come to daddy is a film with some fun moments in it,it also has some nice acting from elijah wood and he was defienetly the best part of a film since they made him were likeable and he was also easily to relate to since all of us in some times had problems with our fathers and he represanted that part of story very well,but film as whole idea wasnt so succesfully made,it has some weak dialogue and some more faster sequances werent so well made,sideline characters were little underused and they felt like they dont belong there since purpose for them isnt that big,come to daddy is a solid film that has nice moments in a pretty much forgettable film",Come to Daddy
11,gwnightscream,Dads Aren't Always Who They Seem,5,16 July 2020,"Elijah Wood and Stephen McHattie star in this 2019 comedy thriller.
Wood (The Faculty) plays Norval, a young man who unexpectedly
receives a letter from his estranged father to come see him. Norval arrives and meets him (McHattie) discovering he's not who he seems. Norval finds himself in a bizarre nightmare with twists. This is a weird flick that starts off ok, but goes downhill. Wood & McHattie aren't bad and I like the settings/scenery. If you're into dark comedies or thrillers, give this one a try.",Come to Daddy

13,jtindahouse,A very unique film that has a little bit of everything,7,15 February 2020,"Only a New Zealander could open their film with a quote from Shakespeare, and then immediately below it a quote from Beyonce. I wasn't actually aware this was a New Zealand made film before going into it, but I was very pleased to see that it was. Who knows, Ant Timpson could be the next Taika Waititi. So has he started his directing career with a good film? I would suggest he has.'Come to Daddy' is a very different film to what I was expecting. Even compared to what I thought I was going to get 20 minutes into the film, it was completely contrasting by the end. What the film first appeared to be, almost a modern version of 'The Lighthouse' between a ""father"" and his son, was a film I actually wanted to see. When the film shifted and became something else I was almost a little disappointed if I am honest.About 10 minutes after that I couldn't for the life of me work out where things were heading. The tone had completely shifted and it was almost becoming an awkward and dark romantic comedy of sorts. Then the film changed again and became something else and finally settled into that storyline until the end of the film. There are at least 3 film ideas all combined into one movie here. All of them equally intriguing in their own way.I think the thing I liked most about this film was that you literally have no idea what is going to come next. Absolutely nothing would have surprised me by the end. There is extreme violence, graphic nudity, extremely coarse language - the film holds absolutely nothing back and I loved it for that. Also Elijah Wood really impressed me. He is in the entire movie and he gives everything he has to his performance.The only criticisms for me would be the film sometimes feels like it has a lack of purpose. You can occasionally find yourself asking where things are headed and what is the point of what is going on. Otherwise though the film has a lot going for it and I am glad to be able to chalk this one up as an above average New Zealand film.",Come to Daddy
14,kevin_robbins,The film is a little all over the place but unpredictable and very entertaining.,7,22 May 2021,"Caught this last night after Edward Delgado's recommendation. The acting is superb and the script is hilarious. Definitely a nice blend of comedy, unpredictable circumstances and gore. The film is a little all over the place but unpredictable and very entertaining. I recommend watching this for sure. Stephen McHattie kills his performance. I'd give this a 6.5-7/10.",Come to Daddy
15,kwenchow,"A bit mystery, but overall not intense, weird and annoying! Should have done better!",2,22 February 2020,"This film start with a man ""Norval"" getting off a bus, and he found a house at the beach scene! As turnout, this film is about Norval saving his father from the gang who lock him inside the basement! The gang lock Norval's father inside the basement, actually is to get back the ransom money of the kidnap job they done together! Entire film full of annoying sound from the house, and annoying imagination scene from the main actor! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, Norval constantly stabbing Dandy private part and kill him! Barely laughable scene is, Gordon intentionally drop Norval's iphone into the water! At the end, Norval dysfunction Jethro car, Jethro having an accident and wounded! Norval eventually using the sharp object stab by Jethro inside his mouth to kill Jethro!

17,yusufpiskin,Funny... But... Disturbing..,6,12 February 2020,"The beauty in Come to Daddy is how it convincingly flips the script on audience expectations when the midway mark hits, drastically shifting from The Autopsy of Jane Doe to You're Next with mostly successful results.The comedy is dark, entertainment is plentiful, and Elijah shines through in another dark horse genre flick.",Come to Daddy

19,jfgibson73,What a useless bag of garbage,6,4 April 2020,"This was a movie with some surprises. I liked where it ended up going. I was worried that something supernatural might be going on, but this movie plays it straight all the way through, which I appreciated. Elijah Wood is infuriating as a helpless sack of crap unable to take the slightest bit of control of a situation. Enjoyable all the way through.",Come to Daddy
20,questl-18592,Into the Wood,5,18 January 2021,"I really appreciate a movie that tries to be different and I love the way Wood has embraced the weird to really distance himself from Frodo and the Shire. It's these artsy, explorative projects that actors like him, Radcliffe and Pattinson explore in the hopes of escaping the legacy of their franchises that lead to some really incredible stuff. While this isn't exactly incredible, Wood's performance is really a fascinating and engagingly captivating display. It's worth checking out fro the wildness of it, it just doesn't quite feel like all the pieces click into place properly which leaves this feeling creative and filled with potential but not quite living up to it.Still, I think it's worth checking out for anyone looking for some horror/comedy fun with a really solid lead performance. The strangeness alone is enough to keep your attention for the brisk duration of the film. Worth checking out if you can stream it somewhere but wouldn't advise spending anything on it.",Come to Daddy
21,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Intriguing Dark Comedy with Horror Elements,8,23 February 2020,"This was a movie that I knew as coming out and was quite excited. From just things that I heard, Elijah Wood and Stephen McHattie are two actors that I've been quite impressed with in pretty much everything I've seen them in. I knew this was coming to the Gateway Film Center, so I made a point to see it when it finally did. It was interesting to hear an interview with the director, Ant Timpson, on the Shockwaves Podcast before seeing this to hear a bit about where the idea of this movie came from as well. The synopsis is a man in his thirties travels to a remote cabin to reconnect with his estranged father.We start this with Norval Greenwood (Wood) getting off a bus in the middle of nowhere. He has a letter with directions where he's going. He walks through the woods to find an interesting house that is overlooking the water. He knocks at the door to find Gordon (McHattie). They embrace as they're father and son and haven't seen each other in a long time like the synopsis states.The relationship is awkward, as Norval is a recovering alcoholic and Gordon is a full blown one. Due to the years apart, they're feeling each other out as neither knows anything about the other. This makes for quite the tense interactions as we get that Gordon doesn't respect his son and Norval is trying to impress him. There's also something off about Gordon.Things take a turn though when something happens as it causes Norval to descend into madness as he tries to find out the truth of what is going on here. Things are much darker than he realized about his father and things that he thought he knew might not necessarily be the case.Now I wanted to go a bit lighter on the recap as this film doesn't have the most complex story to it and a lot of the things to go over are actually in the latter half of the film which would involve me going into spoilers. I don't want to do that here in the recap or this part of my review.In the interview that I heard, this movie came from an experience where the director, Timpson, who is from New Zealand sat with his father after he passed away. It was odd having people come in that he never met and tell him things about his father that he never knew. This movie is a bit more extreme than that and where things lead here, but I thought that was an interesting premise that we got here.This movie though is really driven by the acting. Woods and McHattie are great in this first part of the movie as they play off each other. Both are just so good at becoming the character that they're playing. We do get more of a cast as things go on and I thought that they were all solid as well. The real villain here is solid with Jethro (Michael Smiley) along with the rest of the cast. They really do round this movie out for what is needed.That will take me to the pacing for this movie, which I also thought was good. We get a normal run time of just over 90 minutes and I think that works. The first half hour is establishing these two characters. We then get an event that sends Norval spiraling and then we get reveals that lead us to the ending. It is oddly uplifting despite everything that has happened. What I also like here is that this is part comedy, but much more of a dark comedy. I don't think that it ruins the movie as the jokes are pretty horrible and with my sense of humor, I can appreciate that. I would put this more akin to a Killer Joe type if you've seen that.I want to shift over to the effects. They seem to be done mostly practical from what I could tell and if there is any CGI, it looked real to me. This movie does get quite brutal with what happens and I really can appreciate that. The blood looks good and seeing how violent this gets. The cinematography also was well done as I had no issues there.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I'm trying to think back to it now, but I am drawing a blank. I do remember that it worked with what the movie was going for. The use of sound was also good though. There are some noises that are driving Norval mad and I really thought that worked. Overall I would say that it worked for what was needed, but not a soundtrack I would revisit often.Now with that said, I did really enjoy this movie. It went in a direction that I wasn't expecting and the premise behind where they came up with the story is interesting. This is a brutal film that kept my interest and I like how everything plays out. The acting was strong and it doesn't outstay its welcome. The effects did look realistic with them mostly being practical. The soundtrack didn't necessarily stand out, but I had no issues. The use of sounds though in the house was effective. I would say that this movie is above average overall. This might be one I would revisit again before the year ends as well.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10SPOILERSNow this was a movie I thought I would bring this back here. The big reveal is that the noises draw Norval to a false wall in the hallway. He finds a photo album to discover that the man he thought was his dad isn't really. The noises he's been hearing are actually his real father, David (Martin Donovan) who's been locked in a secret room. He goes there to talk with him and he wants Norval to kill the men who put him here. It turns out that his father is a bad guy. He fled to Thailand and robbed his friends who are Jethro, Dandy (Simon Chin) and Gordon. Norval is an artist who's grown up in Beverly Hills when his mother doesn't work. It turns out that his life has been completely funded by the money that his father stole. This was a pretty good reveal as to the truth of this, so Norval really has to decide to save his father, who's a bad man or just walk away. The problem is that Jethro finds his tag on his luggage and knows where he lives. This helps with the change that comes over Norval in deciding what to do.",Come to Daddy
22,begob,My little tiger,6,30 August 2021,"An eager-to-please son obeys the call of his estranged, reclusive father to come visit, but at their meeting the father is up for a fight ...Interesting scenario that winds up the tension nice and tight in the first act. Then an unexpected full stop that got me looking forward to the possibilities, as the hero is left alone with his deep seated issues in a house that goes bump in the night.And whaddya know - there's a totally offbeat plot development that introduces the mighty Michael Smiley in a sort of Frank Booth role. But it doesn't work. I think the problem is the knowing, facetious dialogue, foreshadowed in a ridiculous line about burping on demand, which drains all the menace - as if the screenwriter was embarrassed by his story. And for whatever reason, Smiley really is not convincing as a force of malevolence - probably because the bloody violence doesn't grow out of the ground prepared earlier in the movie. It's a random sequence, derivative of Martin McDonagh, which comes off as half-hearted juvenile fantasy by introducing throwaway characters after already throwing away the coroner and policeman from earlier on. A couple of scenes at the motel are ripped straight from Tarantino, but have nowhere near the same ear for dialogue. To be honest, I got a bit distracted during the underwhelming climax.And where did the hunchback disappear to? What about the alcohol dependency? Why is the hero a musician? Why the reference to another slit-wrist suicide? Or to the Celestine Prophecies? Maybe the screenplay needed a few more trips through the shredder to grow its integrity.The pace is pretty good, the performances excellent in the first act, and I liked the choice of odd music tracks. The score itself felt a bit dumpty-dumpty-dum in its humour. Apart from that, awesome location and photography.Overall: Pregnant setup spills its load by imitating others.",Come to Daddy
23,omendata,Absolutely Hilarious - May Require A Gaelic Sense Of Humour However!,7,18 February 2020,"This is one crazy film for sure but it had me in stitches - perhaps because I am of the Frankie Boyle stable of merriment and my sarcaustic Scottish heritage and also perhaps why I thought Michael Smiley a fellow Gael made this movie for me and I have never met an Irish brother I have not liked and that has not changed after watching his gleeful and always on the spot performance.I do not for the life of me understand the negative reviews - must be in the Mark Kermode snob-school of film appreciation!From the opening intro with Elijah and his Himmler haircut to the fight with the excellent Stephen McHattie ending in more over the top lunacy in the motel, it was a riot of filthy humour and over the top violence and well what can I say - Being Scottish we love that style - ""Pure dead brilliant"" so it is!",Come to Daddy
24,gedikreverdi,He came to daddy and found more,6,3 August 2021,"Elijah Wood is great as always. I watched him in Maniac before this and he's such an amazing actor. He went to his father's oceanside house after he received a letter from him. They didn't see each other for years as the man left them years ago. They had an altercation and the father dropped dead just before he wanted to kill Norval. The coroner brought the dead body back home because there were floods in town and it had to stay home. They both lay down side by side and talked because there were strange noises in the house and Norval thought it was him. But his real father was chained down in the hole that opened to the floor of the house hidden under the carpet. He went down and a man showed up. The longhaired guy tortured his father. When he went away, Norval snapped his fingers to get him out of there but then they just unhooked the chain from the wall. It turned out his father and those friends of his kidnapped a rich man'a daughter in Thailand and the man stole the ransom money before they got to split it between themselves. And he spent it to make his ex wife and son live a comfortable life in a Beverly Hills mansion. Norval found another man in the bathroom and he went full murderous. And then he hid in the trunk of the longhaired guy's car and went to the motel. He found himself in the middle of a swinger party in disguise of a geology conference. The longhaired guy stabbed him a giant needle and impaled it in his cheek. Then he left for his mother's mansion and had an accident immediately. His skull was cut off and his brain was exposed. The man was walking in the middle of the road and told Norval that his mother was a prostitute and he had sex with her. Then Norval took the needle and stabbed him in the brain. He walked back home thru the woods. His father and him was lying down in the beach against a log. I don't know if he was dead or not but they were together after all. I thought it'd be some supernatural flick, something to do with aliens in disguise of his estranged father or something. But it turned out to be a very different thing which was pretty cool. I really laughed at the motel scene and the twist worked better for me when I watched it in Shyamalan's The Visit. But still it was a nice story and the house by the ocean was amazing.",Come to Daddy
25,Fernando-Rodrigues,Elijah's my crush,5,7 November 2020,"I know it's a dark comedy and not everything needs to make sense, but there are some things that bugged me, not a big deal -like Elijah losing a weapon he could use later, or the other characters noticing the fake daddy was dead days later, bc they were entering the house every day so it didn't make much sense, etc, etc- but it's a cool movie.",Come to Daddy

27,redrobin62-321-207311,"Okay, I Guess.",6,21 February 2020,"I suppose their are much better ways to spend the evening, or night, that sitting in front of ""Come To Daddy"" for 90 minutes. If you choose to, make sure you have a beer or two handy as I did otherwise you'd think it would just be a dull affair. ""Come To Daddy"" is kind of an uneven film in the sense that it's not sure what it wants to be - horror, comedy or crime thriller. Maybe an admixture of all three? In the end, I'm not sure it worked. Even the director's odd choices of background music left a lot to be desired. The closing title music with it's out of tune surf punk guitar was particularly annoying. View, and listen, at your own risk.",Come to Daddy
28,Patient444,More of the same.,5,9 February 2020,"I have no idea why Hollywood keeps making such movies, but obviously there is a market for them, most likely a growing one, thus I expect to see more and more of this genre.On the other hand how did Elijah got here is beyond me, I'm guessing it might have something to do with productions like Maniac and Cooties, also I've noticed he produced others such as Mandy, The colour of space, so all in all, perhaps it's a choice and not a downhill slip for him.Come to Daddy is clearly not my coup of tea, I do get the appeal it has, the dark humor managed to make me smile a few times, but jumping from one extremity to another didn't quite did it for me. I do like some consistency, sure, after a first slower half I did not mind one bit seeing some action but it came in a rather disturbing hilarious way, where I didn't quite know how to take it all in. You see, I am a big fan of productions such as The Visit, where you also see a nice blend of comedy with some disturbing elements, but that one stayed away from torture porn or gore, and it managed to have quite a nice impact on me.All in all definitely not a bad movie, as I mentioned already, I'm sure it will be a blast for many, but not for me. I recommend it only if you're a fan of the genre.Cheers!",Come to Daddy
29,killercharm,Elijah Wood is always a surprise,7,28 February 2020,He is so good in this movie but the whole movie is great. A 30 something goes to see his estranged father only to find intrigue and infighting. Turns out his father is a huge no goodnik who has all kinds of secrets.,Come to Daddy
30,kjproulx,Full of Fun Surprises,8,21 February 2020,"Every now and then a weird movie will come along that intrigues me. One of the most surprisingly weird films I've seen in a while was The Lighthouse, so nothing is going to top that anytime soon, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a blast watching Come to Daddy. When you mesh an interesting premise with odd twists, usually you can hold my attention, but the fact that it also embraces everything being presented and completely delivers is just an added bonus. While I can't exactly recommend this film to all audiences, it's worth a watch for those who enjoy weird stuff. I think I enjoyed this film as much as I did, simply because it's not just weird, but also heartfelt.Come to Daddy follows Norval (Elijah Wood), a man who hasn't seen his father in years, as he travels to reconnect with him after receiving a letter, stating that his father wished to see him again. That premise is really just the first act of the movie, due to many unexpected occurrences. Each act continued to surprise me, even though the finale sort of felt a little been-there-done-that. It takes a few leaps throughout its 95-minute run time, but if you find yourself engaged by these story shifts, I think you'll enjoy it as I did.The Lord of the Rings trilogy is what put Elijah Wood on the map and he has seemed to mostly do independent films ever since. For this reason, most mainstream audiences probably don't even realize he's still out there giving really solid performances. His odd persona in this film was both engaging, yet incredibly eerie. The journey his character goes on is slightly unbelievable but ultimately works as a great arc for the character himself. I highly suggest, even if you don't watch this film, to seek out other work Elijah Wood has done because he really does continue to be a great actor.Where this film may lose some viewers is after the second act kicks into gear, simply because the film becomes much more of a thriller/slasher film. It pretty much goes from a father and son reconnecting to the main character fighting for his life. This shift will probably be too much for some viewers and there are even moments of violence that will make some viewers sick to their stomachs, so be wary. There is really only one moment like that in particular, but I still feel the need to mention it.In the end, Come to Daddy is one of the more enjoyable films that I've seen in quite some time that has seemed to go under the radar all the way until home release. I'm reviewing it now because this was the first time it was even available to me. So, if you're into a weird premise, as long as it's fun and told well, I would absolutely recommend checking this one out. I had more fun with Come to Daddy than I was expecting and I feel that some viewers will share in that experience. It is a huge mess at times in terms of where it wants to take the story, but it's ultimately satisfying.",Come to Daddy

34,johannes2000-1,Weird but intriguing and very entertaining.,8,7 October 2020,"It's not easy to rate this movie, because it's so unusual and strange, I'm not even sure if I watched a thriller or a comedy (it was advertised by the way as a horror, but that didn't quite cover it either). Nevertheless I was highly intrigued and entertained, and to me that's worth a lot, I rank it 8 out of 10.The story seemed to go all over the place, with weird persons not being who you thought they were and characters popping up (the deputy, the coroner, the call-girl and the guests in the motel) that at first seem to be of importance but later on disappear into thin air. After main character Norval (Elijah Wood) descends into the basement of the house things quickly evolve in a totally bizarre, almost grand-guignol-like way. There's much to chuckle about, but also some substantial violence and scary stuff. The house by the way is really awesome, impressively situated above the sea in a totally bleak surrounding, looking heavy with anxious forebodings.The acting of all concerned was fine, to begin with Elijah Wood (although it took me some time to get adjusted to his Tom of Finland moustache), and I especially loved Stephen McHattie in his short but extremely intimidating and overbearing part.If you are into this kind of bizarre thrillers-with-a-twist, then greatly recommended.",Come to Daddy

38,TwistedContent,Genre Defying & Deliciously Entertaining,8,7 February 2020,"""Come to Daddy"" turned out to be so much different from what I imagined - and props for that. This is one of those movies that rejects genre classification, for Ant Timpson and Toby Harvard have compiled a variety of elements, emotions and oddities and have done it organically, no less. Furthermore, Elijah Wood & Stephen McHattie tops off this eccentric cocktail with sparkling performances.A man in his mid-thirties, an urbanite (Elijah Wood), receives a letter of invitation from his father whom he hasn't seen in 30 years & so he journeys to his father's remote cabin by the sea. I had seen the trailer before, read an article or two, but little did I know what I thought will go on for 90 minutes went on only for about 30. The story twists and turns multiple times (from which there are 2 'major' turns), while also keeping a coherent and all-weaved-through emotional ground, consistency. My only complaint is the underwhelming revelation of the fact that Stephen McHattie is not there for the long run. I like the guy a lot. But, naturally, it didn't take away anything for ""Come to Daddy"" has what it takes to engage and entertain all throughout. Amusing characters, witty dialogue, pitch-black humor, pumped-up and gnarly action, certain and stable moral core. First half an hour, the son meeting the father, plays like a Tarantino movie, just throw in the kind of suspense and creepiness only the horror genre can provide. Next up is a man in a storm of confusion, demons and machinations & in the end we count the fates and enjoy the action. As for the audiovisual/aesthetical qualities, ""Come to Daddy"" is shot and edited together tastefully, the technical side holds up to the rest of the goodies.Keeping in my mind that this is Ant Timpson's directional debut, I'm excited to see what else is there to come. More than a solid start. ""Come to Daddy"" is a top-tier, highly creative, excellently performed indie flick, a dark comedy with the undertones of several other genres. My rating: 8/10.",Come to Daddy

The trailer certainly made it look odd but it really felt like it could have gone in just about any direction. There are a lot of movies that come out now which have a huge underground fanbase right away and it's crystal clear that they're already cult classics. Come To Daddy, however, is the type of movie that barely anyone is talking about, that I believe will eventually have a full-on cult classic status - it will take years, maybe decades for people to see though. The true cult classics are the sleepers - and this is one of those!This is a perfect contemporary B-movie. With only a few settings, a small cast, and a simple plot - Ant Timpson (LOL - is that really their name?!) has crafted an electrically entertaining 90 minute feature full of just the right amount of unpredictable elements, bizarro dialogue, and...grotesque gnarliness. Elijah Wood sells this like no one else could, and all the characters aside from him are like bad guys from Saturday morning cartoons, except for adults with sick minds - the whole thing is a heckin' good time.

Soon Norval's limited edition gold iPhone is smashed during a drunken selfie episode as the family reunion commences.With a wine bottle in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other, the fabulous Stephen McHattie provides a belligerent and menacing foe as the crazed papa. There's a chess set in the middle of all the verbal sparring, which as it turns out, is not just a red herring, but a stinky rotten fish. instead of a clever gender duel, ""Come To Daddy"" comes totally off the rails and morphs into a bizarre, way over the top physical thrill ride that leaves many of the clever bits behind.Not that that's a bad thing. It is just a weird thing. Like a double feature in one schizophrenic sitting. Perhaps folks will find pleasure in each half, perhaps not. The set up is certainly presented with snide snark, and creates an unsettling tension. The film looks great, with a velvety saturation glow. The performances are spot on.

The motel prostitute/swingers thing is a good example, it just didn't make any sense.

57,eelen-seth,Cult classic in the making - intoscreens.com,7,1 April 2020,"""There is no one else like my daddy."" - BeyoncéStar and universally renowned hobbit, Elijah Wood (Lord of the Rings-trilogy) has starred in numerous horror/thriller-esque vehicles over the past decade. In New Zealand-born Ant Timpson's directorial debut, 'Come to Daddy' we see Norval Greenwood (Wood), a privileged man-child visit the beautiful coastal home of his estranged father, who he hasn't seen in 30 years. Not remembering a thing about the man, we get to witness an unfortunate family event between the two that will reveal secrets changing both their lives.Timpson, who's known for producing other comedy thrillers such as 'The Greasy Strangler' and 'Housebound', finally takes the wheel and does a pretty good job at envisioning his original idea, developed into a screenplay by Toby Harvard (writer of The Greasy Strangler). What gives the film the edge it really needs to keep your attention is its eye for production design, Daniel Katz's stunningly captivating cinematography which gives the British Columbia filming locations that endless escapism in times of self-isolation, and Karl Steven's unique sound to underline the quirky behaviour of Wood's character along with the situations he finds himself in.Wood himself is unbelievably believable as Norval. The confusing-taken-back-attitude of the character evolves into some sort of unpredictable and surprisingly maniacal detective, who's just out to get all the answers about his past. The rest of the cast is decent, but this is Wood's film without a doubt. What he does with the script and small amount of locations to work with, finds another dimension in his ""grapelike"" eyes which make him look more frightening than charismatic.The film never overstays its welcome and could easily become a cult classic. Clearly inspired by some of Hitchcock's best work and with a twist as unpredictable as that of this year's biggest Oscar winner 'Parasite', Come to Daddy has a level of confidence we don't see that often within the indie-genre. What starts off as a somewhat funny family reunion quickly turns into a dark and very gory thriller that will make you squint your eyes more than once.""The sins of the father are to be laid upon the children."" - William Shakespeare.",Come to Daddy

I get it. The idea here is that growing without a father he's supposed to be that way, aimless and seeking identity, and it does drive the tone of the climax...but it was a bit too cartoonish and on the nose.

He has the skill to link the emotional and the grotesque, with the end result being something, and you can be sure of yourself when you say it, you had never seen before. The story is surprising by itself, holding plenty of twists, but it's the beginning's moody and slow pacing that will mislead you as to what's to come... to say more will mean to spoil it.Elijah Wood had taken on many quirky questionable roles in the past decade, all to try to enhance himself as an actor and he does well. A very unglamorous and almost pathetic role, here he gets to the bottom of our hearts, because everyone roots for the underdog. Most importantly as an actor he enjoys horror films, he produces them and acts in them and his passion is obvious. Here he is having a blast, his character is an oddball of grotesque, sympathetic and sad.

74,andrewburgereviews,Le hipsteresque,3,3 March 2020,"I don't mind violence in movies, as long as it is used as an expression of what the perpetrator is already feeling. ""Come to Daddy"" uses violence in the most tasteless way possible--by making it disgusting. It then acts smart by throwing humor in its midst and saying deal with it--not this time.Director Ant Timpson's inspiration for the plot of this movie, which involves 30-something year-old Norval--yes, that's the actual name--played by Elijah Wood visiting his estranged father, living in a secluded cabin in the woods is inspired by his actual father so I expected more of an insight. From his appearance, Norval seems like a privileged post-modernist hipster whose too much material well-being led him to become a suicidal alcoholic--now sober, his father is still not impressed. But if you think this is going in a certain direction, you are wrong. The plot derails in dumbed-down ways and at the end of it the movie makes you wonder--what's the point?""Come to Daddy"" does not have Tarantino's knack for cool, flamboyant, cheeky violence and Picasso-esque blood splattering for instance. Nor does it have The Coen Brothers feel for elegant strangeness. The strangeness in this movie is just for the sake of seeming interesting. While not spoiling anything, I will tell you that the further misadventures of Norval after meeting his father do add up to a satisfying bunch. The comedic moments, written by screenwriter Toby Harvard are a success even if their timing is weird and the issues are to personal here to make a smooth, a-la Marvel mood transition.The entire movie, the greenhorn Norval really was bothered by one question: why did his father wanted to see him after all these years. The answer, as it should be, is not expressed by words, but by the movie's final few minutes.

""Come to Daddy"" is often comedically awkward and uncomfortable.Which isn't to say this is a bad film. It is not. It plays best when avoiding the humor. And there are several standout performances: Wood does about as well as one might expect given the material. McHattie is his usual wonderfully crusty self; and Michael Smiley gives him a run for the money as a weird cross between Tiny Tim and Lemmy Kilmister.In the end, it is not clear what the ""point"" here was, and while I can't say I disliked it, I was more ""bemused"" than ""amused"" by the dark comedic elements.",Come to Daddy
79,livin_the_weekend,"Slow starter, less than an average watch!",5,22 August 2020,"**NON-SPOILER**The film starts with Norval turning up at his Father's house who he hasn't seen for some years. From there they rekindle on several subjects, catching up with eachother, until something sudden happens. It's at this moment the film really starts and more interesting things are brought into the mix!
That said, it gets a little confusing all at once and you don't really know the full story of why what happens is actually happening.
Some parts of this film had elements of comedy, particularly the cling film scene, but the majority of it just fell flat, I felt a little bored and was really waiting for it to just finish.How anybody can say that this is hilarious is beyond me!?",Come to Daddy
80,ham-ma242,This is a true inspiration for movie creators,10,7 March 2020,"Haven't seen such an indie movie in a long time. Plot twists and an incredible atmosphere that delivers not just tensity, but absurd situations that inspired me to laugh hysterically. A very ""weird"" and I'd say unpredictable movie, a gem to watch, something very refreshing.I'm glad the summary in IMDB is just one sentence that is accurate, yet doesn't reveal anything about the plot. People who put low ratings either didn't watch the movie after 30mins~ or they got some anxiety issues due to that nothing is clear and the dialogue is very vague at the start.Being patient is very rewarding with this movie, because it's not clear what will come next due to so much space created with those uncomfortable moments between characters and how information is limited for somebody to make assessments. Also the soundtrack is nice and the scenery is very beautiful.",Come to Daddy

82,Shuggy,Incredibly Strange,9,10 August 2019,"(The Wellington premiere with Ant Timpson and Emma Slade giving Q&A)O.M.G. That was, as expected, an Incredibly Strange movie. (Ant Timpson is best known in New Zealand for the Incredibly Strange film festival, which began in 1994 with the likes of Plan Nine from Outer Space.)Elijah Wood's character, Norval, is aptly named. He is an innocent nerd, called to visit his estranged-since-childhood father at a remote and beauiful house on the shore of Vancouver Island. The father (Stephen McHattie) is creepy from the get-go (think Jack Nicholson in The Shining). I'll say no more but nothing is as it seems and the movie is a roller coaster ride of extreme tension and release, extreme violence, and a generous slab of (black, of course) comedy. Just suspend your belief enough to erase the words ""We've got to get you to hospital"" from your memory.I didn't stay for all the Q&A because they talked at length about technical details, but Timson based the movie on his own experience with the death of his father, which was Pretty Strange.It'll never be a blockbuster, but it'll be a cult favourite for years to come.",Come to Daddy
83,DrDarkness,Weird but easily forgettable experience,4,9 August 2020,"I'm not entirely sure why this movie was made, if I'm being honest. I like how Elijah Woods can act so naturally a character that's awkward and lost in his life, but I think that's about it for me.I guess an attempt was made here, but I really do not know how the film was supposed to be. It certainly tries to be more than a simple comedy and a simple mystery, but somehow I got the feeling that it didn't quite know how to do that.The comedy side of the movie is generally interesting, but in many cases, way off. It doesn't know if it should try to go with more subtle approach, or hit you in your face with it (and several times in the row, because you know, LOOK AT THIS IT'S FUNNY ISN'T IT LAUGH DAMN YOU).Come to Daddy succeeded in having my interest, but also it managed to lose it in less than half-way into the story.

BUT
after the first act concluded it changes that slow burn approach and turns into more of a funny faspaced thriller with bloody and gory fight scenes (especially the one between Norwell and Dandy....man I literally felt that scene and went OUCH!!!!) LolELIJAH WOOD as NORWELL is very much convincing strong and appreciable
The supporting characters and the main antagonist also does their part wellSo

He and his dad have not seen each other since the dad walked out on him and his mom as a child.Once he arrives, Dad (Stephen McHattie of a History of Violence and Pontypool) greets him less that warmly. The old guy drinks too much, shows no remorse for ditching him, and screams into the phone late into the night.Ultimately, our hero learns his father is not what he seems leading to a twisty, noirish story involving kidnapping, bank robbing, and sudden bouts of extreme violence. The movie seems to want to be a Joe R. Landsdale style weird mystery and I guess it is. It just never gets off the ground.The two leads, Wood and McHattie, are good but they can't save the movie. Wood's character is the guy we're following and frankly, he just isn't that interesting. I've seen the movie's big twist before and done better. It's reasonably well shot and some of the violence, all of which is in the third act, is shocking and impressive but the movie takes so long to get going it just wasn't worth it for me.

104,frostyfrog,Come To Daddy,5,25 March 2020,"Come To Daddy is a film directed by Ant Timpson that stars Elijah Wood (""Lord Of The Rings"") that tells the story of a man child who arrives at a cabin by the sea to meet his father, whom he has not seen in thirty years. This film has flown under many people's radars as a sort of Hidden gem and there is a lot to like about it. Each act is effective in it's own way with the first being incredibly tense and mysterious where very clearly all is not as it seems, pushing viewers to the edge of their seats, the second is bloody, gruesome and revealing as details hidden at first reveal a grandiose story and the third is a fusion of what each of the first two acts did well with the suspense of the first and gruesomeness of the second with an emotionally satisfying crowd pleasing conclusion. The story of this film definitely took risks and showed me things that I haven't seen in awhile from a violence perspective and I loved it which is why I was frustrated when the film went into a more predictable route screenplay wise as it progressed. The predictable plot of the film was backed by a backstory that is so ridiculously large scale that you might have issues taking it seriously. Despite these issues though the film does have a lot going for it like a beautiful somber score and a pretty decent performance from Elijah Wood (I haven't seen him in a film since the Lord Of The Rings trilogy but he is doing his own thing now and it is both weird and amazing). The film is also paced pretty well too as there really isn't a full moment throughout. All in all, ""Come To Daddy"" isn't incredible cinema or the most original movie of the year and it didn't have to be, it just had to do what it's intent was which was to unnerve and entertain and it did just well enough at that for me to think of it fondly.",Come to Daddy
105,coldwarkid,Unexpectedly entertaining.,8,26 May 2020,"I never had a lot of time for Elijah Wood, but this is the 3rd movie I've seen him in of late and I've been impressed, it's also always a treat to see the very underrated Stephen Mchattie. I wasn't sure what to expect and found it a little slow to begin with but it gradually became very engaging as it unfolds into a very dark comedy of sorts. Comparisons aren't everyones cup of tea but it was not unlike Coen Bros film. I'm not going to say anything about the plot, but it was a very pleasant surprise to see Michael Smiley appear as the deranged 'Jethro'.
I really enjoyed this movie.",Come to Daddy

The thing is it doesn't try that much.This movie starts fine but it changes the course to go for a very bland comical action approach that ends anywhere, with an emotional ending trying to give meaning to something that doesn't have one. It'd still be good if this change was well-made but well, I went from intrigue to boredom by the second part of it while seeing a movie trying a bit too hard to be somewhat dark-ish and funny at the same time.Decent idea, fairly entertaining, it had its moments and wasn't bad technically speaking either, so I give it a 5/10.",Come to Daddy

Care to see Elijah Wood's face stabbed through with a motel receipt holder?

'Come to Daddy' is as weird as it is unexpected, but I will say not watching the trailer and going in this with the only expectation that something unexpected will happen will increase the experience.I stumbled onto this movie through Elijah Wood as I enjoy the weird stories he finds himself into. I think he genuinely enjoys being in these quirky stories even if many of them are not rated well by the general public. Come to Daddy is no different. I can totally see why its rated this poorly, but I can also say this movie has its tense moments and its laugh out loud moments. It's weird enough to be entertaining, but don't expect... actually just don't expect anything.The movie might be terrible, the movie might be a riot, but whatever you expected, it probably won't be that. And I think that's as much of a compliment as it is a critique, because I did expect something else, but what I got was not bad either. Well, your mileage will vary.Sometimes in life, you just have to experience something different, and this movie definitely fills that box. As I end the review, I know I've literally said nothing of value, but it also feels like the perfect way to encapsulate this film. I also realize this is as ambiguous as the movie itself.

With a premise that sets the tone, the film soon takes a turn away from the expected, taking viewers on an obscure ride through the eyes of the films protagonist, Norval (Elijah Wood).With a plethora of bizarre situations which Norval and other characters face, the main appeal of this intriguing film comes from its whacky characters, un-easing situations and interesting occurrences which help to build on the truly uncanny ground that the main story of the film is built upon.It's hard to recommend 'Come to Daddy' because it's so unique. At the same time, it's a film that I'd certainly suggest giving a chance and viewing in the comfort of your own home. Just don't go in expecting anything.

141,gerardsiebert,Time to change the rating system,8,23 February 2020,"So many times I watched a movie with bad reviews mainly rated by young people and it turned out I loved the movie.
Can YouTube somehow take into consideration to show ratings per generation or age range?I'm tired of trolls with short attention spans having a major impact on ratings, using reviews as an outlet for their primary reactions. Most of their comments are immature, stupid or ignorant.Yeah, c'mon hate on me. I bet this probably sounds like grumpy old man talk to you.Let's just respect the fact that there is a generation gap and I'd like to be able to sort the ratings by age range.",Come to Daddy
142,matt-154-675638,Stay Away,2,23 March 2020,This movie wasted two hours of my life. Unfortunately I can't get that back but maybe I can save you the headache. This movie made no sense.,Come to Daddy
143,craigfreeman-95230,Never got good from start to finish,3,24 February 2021,What a disappointment this movie was. I never quite understood where this movie was headed and the ending was just a splattering of crazy characters and a pointless plot. Not quite sure how this film got such high ratings from others,Come to Daddy
144,A_Deer,Bland. Desperate to be a cult film,1,9 February 2020,"It was a slow start, never picks up and unfortunately any potential was wasted, with the most horrific thing about this movie being it's god awful writingAn endlessly shocking thrill ride it was not, the on screen violence probably had a total run time of 2 mins, and the actions of some of the characters makes little sense other than to progress the poor excuse for a storysome of the actions and inaction of the characters is mindless, it all feels so linear and unnatural.You get an uneasy feeling due to the dialogue of some characters but it never goes anywhere, they make no other appearance and don't help the plot either, only serving as bizarre red herrings,It feels like the Director desperately wants to create a cult film and figured by having odd characters, strange dialogue, good cast, obscure violence and throwing everything at the wall that something will stick and perhaps some people actually do see all these elements and are fooled into believing its so weird it must be good, this also gives the Director a great out when It comes to criticism as he can claim he didn't want to be conventional, however it all comes off as arrogant and pretentious.The cast is fantastic and fantastically wasted here, I thoroughly enjoyed 'A field in England' featuring Michael Smiley which really was a dark and thrilling low budget featuring film.Unremarkably NZ media appears unable to give the film a negative review as it seems the director is a treasure in the industry and their reviews certainly let you know it, as well as how horrifying, brilliant and shocking the film is, an if it wasn't the unforgivable garbage that it is, there's actually many films that do low budget over the top violence well such as 'Brawl in cell block 99' 'Green Room' or the firefly trilogy,the violence in this film however is exclusively brief and intended to shock, like a cheap joke,
Seriously don't waste you're time on this oneI conclude this is a very conceited film which never gets off the ground, nothing about it is nuanced, the humor is sparse, but this does nothing to save its clunky pacing and terrible story and writing",Come to Daddy

146,Riley-Housedog,Whimsical - Not in a good way,4,1 August 2020,"The connotations for this film being a psychological thriller carried much of my interest, at least for the first 30 minutes of viewing. Beyond that, the film's potential had only morphed into a corny sequence of spur-of-the-moment events, and slapstick follow-through. Expecting to hopefully find redemption in a somewhat meaningful punchline, I continued watching, only to unfortunately discover that it failed to deliver even that. Although the writer/director's intention was to create and utilize a combination of film styles, the film remains feeling half-fleshed, and ultimately attempting to discover what it was truly meant to be. At best, this film is merely imitating a caricature of what its true intention was. For that reason, Come to Daddy was a total miss.",Come to Daddy

148,slander83,Ant is a cool name but...,2,23 February 2020,"I agree with Stephen Whitty of 'Screen daily' full throttle.
HEre is a movie from a new director we are hoping will bring a new feel somewhat like Hereditary{after reading all the swimmingly albeit undeserved reviews} and maybe enjoy a few new actors or accents a la Tkitti ( director of jojorabbit) -i know i cant spell his name. But instead we get a mashup of one well known actor, well trained at playing complex characters, and a bunch of hard hitting players that can hold there own. Unfortunately for me , this movie lacks character development, swims thru plotholes and all in all feels like a bad dream. Not sure where this script came from but find a better one next time Ant, this movie is gory NOT scary at all.",Come to Daddy

ending also not worth the wait",Come to Daddy

155,caidenclark,Over the top thriller,6,15 June 2020,"This movie was a very fun watch. Elijah Wood does a wonderful job selling his character as a priviledged adult. It does an excellent job grasping your attention in the first act, even though it tends to slow down a lot in the second. The third act successfully ramps it back up and this is where the movie shines as the over the top gorefest it is. There are a few suspenseful scenes that will keep you invested and glued to the screen, and there are quite a few interactions between characters thay will give you some laughs to ease the tension the rest of the movie lays on you. Fun movie to watch, and definitely a good movie to recommend.",Come to Daddy

160,jennifereveortega,"""Come to Daddy"" is a Hilarious, Manically Violent, Sentimental Dream of a Film",10,7 February 2020,"The fact that this film exists makes my heart happy. ""Come to Daddy"" is the directorial debut of celebrated producer Ant Timpson (Turbo Kid, Deathgasm). The initial idea came from Timpson and then was masterfully written by Toby Harvard (The Greasy Strangler). I'm obsessed with the dialogue in the film. Part of the beauty of ""Come to Daddy"" is that it eases effortlessly between genres. It is intensely macabre, cartoonishly gory, but it's also insanely hilarious and sweetly emotional and tender. ""Come to Daddy"" is about a man in his thirties named Norval (Elijah Wood) who goes to see his long-lost father Gordon (Stephen McHattie) in his remote home. That's really all you should know about the plot. Within the beautiful insanity & mania of ""Come to Daddy,"" the core of this screwed up dynamic between Norval and Gordon is actually very relatable and authentic. I cannot imagine anyone but Elijah Wood playing Norval. There is something in his gaze that perfectly captures the nuances of the character, and Stephen McHattie is just so good as his father, Gordon. Michael Smiley appears in the film almost unrecognizable and is just incredible.I am so tempted to write specifics on scenes and lines and why they resonate so much, but this film is way too magical to spoil. There's so much mediocrity in film, music, people...so when you see the horror/family-drama/black comedy film of your dreams, it's special. Thank you, Ant and Toby, for expanding the ranges of horror. ""Come to Daddy"" is genius and I genuinely hope both of them keep on creating for years and years and years on end.",Come to Daddy

It is such a bizarre patchwork of nonsense, it feels like someone took several movies from different genres, and just started splicing them together in a haphazard and pointless way.

It seems that something went wrong in to justify the nonsense of the film. It is like entering a restaurant alone and paying the bill without having dinner. It is forced to try to make the story strange without the being interesting.
Bah Long live who has money to throw in the cinema... It is to show in film schools and then say to the students and then say ""Have you seen this movie? We showed it to you to understand what not to do"". I am on an empty stomach and I have paid the bill.",Come to Daddy
