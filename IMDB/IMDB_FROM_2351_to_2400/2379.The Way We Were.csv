0,MartinHafer,In many ways the film is beautifully made--but with one HUGE flaw,6,12 June 2005,"The music, the directing and acting are just fine in the movie. The only problem for me (and others may NOT care about this) is the basic relationship problem. Robert Redford is stunningly handsome, rather quiet, rich and conservative in the movie. So WHY would he be interested in Barbra Streisand's character? She is loud, exceptionally opinionated, liberal and not attractive (this is a BIG acting stretch for her, I know)--at least in a conventional sense. We have all heard the old saying ""opposites attract"", but it is only an old saying and really isn't true. If it were, then believing this relationship would be a lot easier. The problem is, they just don't seem to have ANY common ground. If they were incompatible but had SOME mutual interests or similarities, I could buy the conflict.Fans of ""Babs"" no doubt think I'm a moron for not understanding or appreciating her greatness. While I may be a moron (the jury's still out), most Americans either adore her or can't stand her films. I'm one of the latter ones.",The Way We Were
1,bkoganbing,"""If We Had The Chance To Do It All Again, Tell Me, Would We, Could We?""",9,17 January 2009,"I recall a line from The Alamo in which John Wayne says to Linda Cristal that political differences don't make for good breakfast talk between a man and a woman. That's a piece of wisdom that Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford should have remembered for their characters in The Way We Were.Meet Hubbell Gardiner and Katie Marofsky from the Thirties at Columbia University. Redford as Gardiner is your all American athlete and the Prince Charming of many a young girl's dreams. An elegant WASP Ivy League future is in store for him if he wants it. One of those girls who thinks Redford is Prince Charming is Barbra Streisand as Katie Marofsky. She's a member of the young Communists and is one eloquent campus radical for her cause. When we see her she's got a picture of Lenin in her dormitory room. We see her talking about the cause of Republican Spain and the budding young Ivy League Republicans on the campus are hooting her down. All, but Redford who's impressed by her convictions even if he doesn't share them.But when the USA does get into World War II and Redford is in the Navy and Streisand now working for the Office of War Information now meet. Politics seem to take a back seat to romance and Streisand lives out a real life fairy tale as a Brooklyn Jewish Cinderella.Their love gets really tested in the post World War II period during the Red Scare. Streisand's not quite the Communist she once was, a picture of FDR is now in her room. That was in fact one of FDR's main contributions to our body politic, winning over budding revolutionaries like Streisand to support our democratic, (big and small ""D"") way of life. But he's gone now and the Soviet Union has become our cold war enemy. A lot of people are now caught in the post war reaction.Because Hollywood is the glamor capital of the world and right-wing politicos can't get any mileage out of investigating Communist plumbers, it's to the movie capital that the House Un-American Activities Committee turns. Redford is now working in that industry as is Streisand. Redford sees the problem in personal terms, Streisand sees the big picture, but that's all she does see. How things resolve themselves is the basis of The Way We Were.With all the political differences there beats the heart of one of the best love stories ever done in Hollywood. When Redford's around, Streisand lights up the screen with her passion for him. But it never quite covers the different world views they have.With such detail given to the stars by director Sydney Pollack, the supporting cast and it's a good one, never really establish their characters. Maybe that's what he wanted, to have them appear as plastic as Streisand's Katie Marofsky thinks they are.The Way We Were contains the title song written by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bregman which became one of Streisand's best loved ballads. Her singing of that song is unforgettable whether heard on record or if fortunate, live at one of her concerts. Bing Crosby also made a nice recording of it for one of his last albums. Hamlisch also won an Oscar for Best overall Musical Score that year, they were the only two Oscars won by The Way We Were.The sad thing about The Way We Were is that Streisand and Redford hold such different views and yet are fundamentally decent people who cannot agree to disagree. It's what makes The Way We Were such a beautiful, yet ultimately sad film.",The Way We Were
2,SnoopyStyle,the never-changing look of a God,7,18 February 2019,"It's WWII. Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) is a Jewish girl working in New York radio pumping out patriotic programming among her many activist jobs. In a nightclub, she runs into former crush and Naval officer Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford). In college, she was a communist student leader struggling to rally against Franco with Frankie McVeigh (James Woods). He was the WASP star athlete, the man around campus, and outwardly lived a carefree life. He's taken with her tenacity and she admires his writing. In the post war years, they are married in Hollywood where he writes for the studio and she fights against Mcarthyism.She has the better part. He's playing the trophy wife. His hemming and hawing with his writing is a bit infuriating. He's too cool for school except for a few emotional outbursts. Those are great for showing some depth in his character although the couple seems to have only two polar opposite gears. As for her, Streisand gives it her all. There is a grating edge to her character which is not that appealing. I do like that these two flawed characters struggle with their undeniable connection until I can't take their unending fight about politics. Another issue is the unchanging Grecian God beauty of Redford's look. This movie takes place over decades. He needs to change. Maybe give him a buzz cut during the war years. There is the famous song which I wouldn't diss or praise. Pollack delivers a solid melodrama although the relationship gets too melodramatic at times.",The Way We Were
3,mark.waltz,Love among the ruins of personal freedoms.,8,13 September 2016,"You can't force romance to blossom, to grow, to continue. What you can do is reflect on the mistakes to grow from them, remain true to yourself even while thoroughly and totally in love, and by all means, remember the laughter. For those of us who have tried but failed in love, it is those moments that with luck will prevent the bitterness from taking over and if the two people are mature enough to be in the same room years later without regret, they may even be able to smile at each other and thank them for the memories.The theme song from this romantic drama says it all as political activist Barbra Streisand falls head over heals with the perfect smiling toothy Robert Redford. She allows her love for him to consume her, pleading with him to see how perfect she is for him, while he demands space. A previous meeting had him basically ravaging her while in a drunken stupor has her allowing the liaison even though he doesn't know that it's her. Streisand really lets loose with the strengths, the insecurities, the demands, and of course, the finger nails. She leads Redford around by the nose for a short time, but is perhaps too out of his league, too needy yet too intense. She tries to fit in his world, but it only makes her more demanding. Yet, she's not a nasty person, and no matter how hard she tries to tone it down, can't betray who she is inside.Redford gives his all to keep up with Barbra, but in the long run, the passion she gives to this project makes her the driving force behind its success and legendary status. Even with a cast of veteran actors of stage, screen and TV, there's just no time for any of them to get their fingers into the bowl. A young James Woods does show promise as Barbra's constant companion in the beginning of the film. This is Barbra's film all the way, and love her or hate her, you can't help but admire her tenaciousness. The script by Arthur Laurents and direction by Sydney Pollack are pieces of wood glued onto Barbra's deep thought into her characterization, so the puzzles of who she is come together. This maintains one of the best finales in film made within my lifetime, and one that is heartbreaking as well as touching.",The Way We Were
4,lee_eisenberg,"Anyone remember in ""Gilda Live"", when Gilda Radner played the theme song?",7,13 February 2006,"OK. So Barbra Streisand has a weird reputation (although I agree with her political views), and Robert Redford is...well, I don't know how to finish the sentence (although it seems that his politics are about the same as Streisand's). But ""The Way We Were"" does what it can to look at politics from the Depression to the postwar era. Streisand is the left-wing political activist, Redford the apolitical athlete, and they become lovers, but get forced apart by the red-baiters.Apparently, when this came out, director Sydney Pollack wanted people to interpret it mostly as a love story, but also to pay attention to the politics. I still don't know whether the political aspect or the lovey-dovey aspect is supposed to dominate. As a political message, this is certainly a good movie, but do we need the love story? By the way, has anyone ever seen Gilda Radner's concert movie ""Gilda Live""? In one scene, she appear as Lisa Loopner, describes this movie's plot, and plays ""The Way We Were"" on the piano. The things that we see in life.",The Way We Were
5,jboothmillard,The Way We Were,6,14 May 2008,"I think the main reason I wanted to see this film was because of the title song by the leading actress, and it sounded quite good, from director Sydney Pollack (Tootsie). Basically Katie Morosky (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Barbra Streisand) runs into past love Hubbell Gardner (Robert Redford), and of course we see a flashback to the love they used to have in college in the 1940's. Back in this present time, 20 years later, they reconnect quite quickly. The only problem they have is their political opinions, and Katie pushing Hubbell to write another book. It may have lasted a good long while, but eventually their differences separate them again, and in the end they meet again, moved on and saying what is essentially goodbye (for good). Also starring Bradford Dillman as J.J., introducing Moonraker's Lois Chiles as Carol Ann, Patrick O'Neal as George Bissinger, Viveca Lindfors as Paula Reisner, Allyn Ann McLerie as Rhea Edwards, Murray Hamilton as Brooks Carpenter, Herb Edelman as Bill Verso, Diana Ewing as Vicki Bissinger, Sally Kirkland as Pony Dunbar, Marcia Mae Jones as Peggy Vanderbilt and young James Woods as Frankie McVeigh. It may be a bit too chatty at times, and Streisand and Redford are a little forceful in their performances, but the Oscar winning music by Marvin Hamlisch, and of course the Oscar and Golden Globe winning title song by Streisand (which was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Songs) is certainly worth the while. It was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design. It was 64 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Good!",The Way We Were
6,moonspinner55,Hollywood schmaltz or deeply felt love story?,9,4 September 2005,"Actually, ""The Way We Were"" is both, and happily so. It's a classy romantic period drama about a 1940s wallflower in New York who blooms in love with her ex-jock boyfriend (an old acquaintance from their college days), and the movie overflows with star-power. None of today's celebrities have the kind of chemistry Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford bring to the screen, and Streisand in particular is so deeply into this character that the herky-jerky editing and breathless writing don't harm her or get in the way (the faults can easily be overlooked). When writer Redford adapts his novel into a screenplay and the couple marries and moves to Hollywood in the McCarthy-Blacklist era, her passion for politics gets them both in hot water; that's where this script hits a snag, with increasingly melodramatic plotting (Redford's affair with a former flame) and confusion in the character motivations (this primarily due to hasty, eleventh-hour editing). Still, it is a handsomely-produced movie with a great tearjerker ending and two fine stars who plow right through the nonsense and bumpy continuity. They transcend the make-believe surroundings, turning the picture into something really special, something to remember. ***1/2 from ****",The Way We Were
7,tavm,"I finally got to see The Way We Were and for the most part, I loved it!",8,17 October 2012,"When Marvin Hamlisch died several weeks ago, I suddenly found myself wanting to watch this movie, having never seen it before but reading and hearing about it over the years and what a classic it was. So I added it to my Netflix list of DVD's for delivery. The famous song that Hamlisch wrote with lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman with Barbra Streisand's vocals is here but in a different version than the one I heard on the radio over the years which had a more contemporary '70s vibe than the more orchestral version played here. Such a touching and memorable song that was and hearing it in the score quite frequently in the picture made the whole thing almost perfect. I said almost because, as many of you reading this probably know, director Sydney Pollack had cut a couple of pertinent scenes that, when I watched the accompanying short doc that was also on the disc that showed these sequences, made sense why things happened at the end when they did. I mean, watching the film without them made things a little confusing but still had a bittersweet romantic effect that still gave a somewhat touching climax due to the talents of Pollack, Streisand, Hamlisch, and especially leading man Robert Redford. The whole period from the late '30s to the '50s was so fascinating to look at and Arthur Laurents' screenplay was awash in dialogue that was to die for especially between Barbra and Robert. Really, all I'll say now is The Way We Were is still something worth seeing and thinking about afterwards...",The Way We Were
8,edwagreen,"""The Way We Were"" Is the Way A Picture Should Be ****",10,22 April 2006,"Barbra Streisand's second Oscar nomination for lead actress came for ""The Way We Were."" As far as I'm concerned, the race that year came down to Streisand and Joanne Woodward for ""Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams."" How Glenda Jackson won for ""A Touch of Class"" was a big surprise to myself and others as well.Streisand is perfect as the Jewish girl who finds love with a handsome gentile guy well played by Robert Redford. The two together on screen have a perfect chemistry.Of course, Streisand pulls some usual shtick but it's well done. She acts just the way you'd think she'd act when the news comes that President Franklin Roosevelt has died.Of course, just like in ""Funny Girl"" her marriage is again unsuccessful. Hubbell (Redford) is really in a different league from Streisand and the years point out these differences.That final scene is gut-wrenching.With an Oscar winning song, how can this film miss?""What's too painful to remember, we simply choose to forget."" Nothing painful about this film. It will not be forgotten.The story basically points to the fact that Streisand, in a perfect role for her, is an activist and total non-conformist. This invariably leads to the heartbreaking ending. The film is rich in history in that the Franco 1937 upheaval in Spain and the Hollywood black-listing period are both well described. Streisand was certainly a rebel with a cause.",The Way We Were
9,sunwarrior13,A Hit Classic Inspite Of Its Limitations,10,1 August 2013,"The Way We Were is a romantic film about a handsome young man and a radical and ordinary looking Jewish girl that features Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford.The screenplay by Arthur Laurents.It was based on his college days at Cornell University and his experiences with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Sydney Pollack directs.Katie Morosky is the secretary of the campus Young Communist League. Hubbell Gardiner,to whom Katie is fascinated due to fact that he is not only incredibly handsome and the top athlete on campus, but also writes great fiction for their short story class. Unfortunately,for all of his charms and talents, however, he's basically weak: He drifts into love affairs on the strength of drunken excuses and drifts out if the girl has too independent a mind. Katie does.She can't stand Hubbell's WASP friends with their jokes about Eleanor Roosevelt and their endless weekend cocktail parties. Hubbell, on the other hand, suggests that she find an additional mode of address to supplement her basic one, the impassioned political harangue. Anyway, they have nothing in common. But nevertheless,they they fall in love and get married and they move to Hollywood.They arrive roughly during the McCarthy period, and of course Katie is outraged in defense of the Hollywood 10 and Hubbell doesn't care. So we're all set up for the big obligatory scene where Katie stands up for principle and Hubbell chickens out at a HUAC hearing.Inexplicably, the movie suddenly and implausibly has them fall out of love and they split up.Overall,it is an engrossing, if occasionally ludicrous, hit tearjerker with Pollack, Streisand, and Redford doing a good job of bringing Laurents' script to the screen.It is enjoyable as a star vehicle for its handsome stars - Redford and Streisand - in their only film together.Although it does not resolve anything in the end and it turns out to be a talky melodrama with politics in the background,the stars manages to make the film a hit classic inspite of its limitations.",The Way We Were
10,preppy-3,Mixed feelings,7,4 May 2003,"Love story mixed with politics. Radical Barbra Streisand falls for all-American boy Robert Redford. It chronicles their relationship from the 1930s to the 1950s. They love each other but her political commitment bothers him--can their relationship survive?On one hand I love this movie--the title song is wonderful (of course); Streisand and Redford do have chemistry between them; the script is sharp and intelligent; the film looks absolutely beautiful with particular care and attention given to the clothes and settings; it doesn't downplay the politics; the romance never becomes too mushy--but this movie left me kind of cold.I never really believed Redford and Streisand were lovers--they DO have chemistry and she gives out a great performance--but Redford is so stone-faced I didn't know how to take him. Also there was severe cutting in the last reel leaving some serious plot holes. So Redford's non-acting and the plot loopholes seriously damage the film.Still it's worth seeing for all the other actors--all of whom are excellent (especially a very young James Woods and Lois Chiles) and some truly romantic love scenes. And, again, the beautiful title song.",The Way We Were
11,writers_reign,Nostalgia IS What It Used To Be,10,28 October 2009,"This may well be the last Great movie to come out of Hollywood. Okay, let me qualify that; I mean in the sense of an Original Screenplay written directly for the screen as opposed to an Adaptation from another medium (for example the year after this film was released Redford starred in an unsuccessful film adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's novella The Great Gatsby with a budget probably five times greater than The Way We Were and light years inferior to the 1949 Alan Ladd version which in comparative terms was made for a stick of gum), a movie that is character driven and plot driven as opposed to cgi driven, a big budget movie in which all the Above The Line personnel - Writer, Actors, Director, Composer/Lyricist(s) - are all A-List as opposed to an Indie with few if any A-Listers involved. It may work so well because we've seen elements before - it's quite possible that Noel Coward, for instance, was the first writer to set a story spanning several decades against a backcloth of international events that serve as shorthand to link the passage of time; he did it first in Cavalcade and again in This Happy Breed but Arthur Laurents borrows it to great effect in a plot that is punctuated by, among other things, The Spanish Civil War, The death of FDR, the witch-hunts overseen by HUAC and the Ban The Bomb campaign. Then there's the radio element long familiar to admirers of Irwin Shaw (who began by writing for radio in the thirties) via his brilliant - and unjustly neglected novel The Troubled Air. Then, of course there's the bittersweet love story that's been with us since the cradle and this one takes one of the greatest, Brief Encounter, and puts spin on it. I'm not a particularly great fan of either Redford or Streisand but in this entry I couldn't fault either and have only the highest admiration for both. Beyond superb.",The Way We Were
12,grantss,"Schmaltzy, dull, irritating",2,26 February 2016,"Schmaltzy, dull, irritating.Set in the period from the mid-1930s to the 1950s, a love story involving two markedly different people. Katie is an idealistic, uptight, Stalin-loving political activist. Hubbell is an easy- going, athletic, All American-type, and a talented writer. We see their different personalities affect their relationship and how they manage despite the differences...Pretty much your stereotypical romantic drama, but with added dullness and schmaltz. So long-winded and pointless.There is potential for profound statement, especially when we run into the McCarthy witch-hunts, but this is handled so heavy-handedly that the movie defeats its own purposes.Elevating the nausea is Barbara Streisand, and her character, Katie. One of the most irritating characters in cinematic history. The fact that Hubbell sticks with her despite her personality being so off-putting harms any credibility the relationship had.Robert Redford puts in a solid performance as Hubbell, and his presence probably gives us a clue to why this movie is so highly rated. The producers' idea was probably ""Hey, how about a romantic drama, with Robert Redford in uniform for the majority of it. Women will love it!"". Sure does look like they fell for the ploy...",The Way We Were
13,evanston_dad,Forced Nostalgia in a Fake Hollywood Romance,5,8 June 2007,"I just recently posted a comment about ""The Painted Veil,"" a splendid film that came out in 2006 and was virtually ignored by everyone. I praised it and compared it to ""Brief Encounter"" for bringing to the screen a good old-fashioned Hollywood romance without resorting to the fakey, absurd hokum that the genre so often relies on.""The Way We Were"" is exactly the kind of fakey hokum I was talking about. It's as if director Sydney Pollack was more interested in capturing a couple of scenes that would make great clips at awards shows for years afterwards than he was in making a good movie. Robert Redford makes a handsome if bland leading man, and Barbra Streisand transforms from a frizzy-haired Jewish girl to a ravishing adult (and straight-haired) woman who loves him. Didn't she do something similar in ""The Mirror Has Two Faces?""...... We're supposed to think this romance is oh-so-adult and realistic because the lovers don't end up together at the end. By the time the end rolls around (and this isn't a short movie) you'll just be glad that they're making a decision about one another; I doubt you'll care much about what that decision is.And of course there's the theme song...ugh! that theme song!

14,anaconda-40658,The Way This Fails.,5,16 December 2015,"The Way We Were (1973): Dir: Sydney Pollack / Cast: Barbra Streisand, Robert Redford, Bradford Dillman, Lois Chiles, Patrick O'Neal: An opposites attract romance where the male cannot commit himself yet he can sleep with the woman in question. Romance reflecting upon nicer times that grow into loveless empty worlds. Barbra Streisand plays a political activist and Robert Redford plays a Hollywood screenwriter whom she knew long ago. They get reacquainted and romance blooms but they share different views on political issues. Directed with insight by Sydney Pollack who previously made Jeremiah Johnson and They Shoot Horses Don't They? While his talent brings out the theme, the screenplay blemishes the theme with its formula driven romantic drivel. Streisand plays her role with zest and intelligence but when she becomes pregnant Redford is unable to be there thus concluding upon bypassed responsibility. Redford is a fine actor but here he plays a guy who is unlikable and unsympathetic. Supporting roles are also flat with Bradford Dillman and Lois Chiles among others basically filling space. This film isn't very romantic by any means but it does feature the inspiring vocals of Streisand within the film's signature song. Although its romantic themes diminish it does reflect upon missed opportunities and moving on with hidden regret. Score: 5 ½ / 10",The Way We Were
15,HotToastyRag,Classic love story,5,26 September 2017,"If you haven't seen The Way We Were, you're missing one of the great classic romances. Watching it isn't a guarantee that you'll like it, but at least you'll be able to say you've seen it. Two of the biggest stars of the 1970s, Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand, unite in this unforgettable love story that supports the great theory of opposites attracting.Robert Redford, in his infinite handsomeness, comes from a privileged background and meets the stubborn, politically active Barbra Streisand in college in the 1930s. While she argues about Marxism and social injustice, he prefers to enjoy the simple and finer things in life. Somehow—you'll have to watch the movie to find out—the unlikely pair fall in love, but because of their dynamic, it's not always smooth sailing. ""You push too hard,"" Bob says to Babs in one memorable argument. ""Oh, but look what I got,"" she smiles. If there's a woman in the audience who doesn't tear up during that line, I'll give her a refund on her ticket price.Parts of the movie are sweet, parts are frustrating, and parts are hard to watch as Arthur Laurents captures the realism of difficult relationships. But if you're a fan of either of the actors, or like watching classic love stories like Love Story or When Harry Met Sally, you need to add this movie to your weekend watch list. Stock up on Kleenex and popcorn, and get ready to fall in love with Robert Redford.",The Way We Were
16,Wuchakk,A radical Left-winger falls in love with a more conservative WASP on the verge of WW2 and post-war,7,14 August 2019,"A disparate couple meets in college in 1937, New York, and then reignite after the war. Katie (Barbra Streisand) is an uber-Liberal while Hubbell (Robert Redford) is more levelheaded about politics. He becomes a writer in Hollywood during the blacklist investigations of the late 40s wherein Katie's activism threatens his social life and career. The story closes in 1957.""The Way We Were"" (1973) is a classic drama/romance, much acclaimed in its day. The vibe is similar to ""Love Story"" (1970) but this has superior characters and a more interesting setting.It's interesting to see how loony Liberals existed way back then in the 30s-40s. The movie works because it wisely makes Katie three-dimensional. Sure, she's a typical INtolerant, obnoxious Leftie, but she also has a human side, a warm and humble side. Meanwhile Redford is at the top of his game here. Streisand incidentally developed a crush on Redford during shooting, but didn't share her feelings. He feigned ignorance and used Barbra's infatuation for the benefit of the movie.There has been some confusion about the last act. Pay attention to what Hubbell says. What happens has nothing to do with Carol Ann and everything to do with the obvious.The film runs 1 hour, 58 minutes, and was shot in Union College in Schenectady, New York; Ballston Spa in upstate New York; New York City; Malibu; and nearby Union Station in Los Angeles.

17,JamesHitchcock,Misty Water-Colored Movie,6,20 September 2013,"""Memories, Like the corners of my mind Misty water-coloured memories Of the way we were"". When I recently sat down to watch ""The Way We Were"" for the second time (the first having been over ten years ago) I realised that Marvin Hamlisch's famous theme song was about the only thing I could remember about it. Of the film itself I only had misty water-coloured memories of a campus romance between a handsome, blond upper-class WASP boy and a working class girl, a sort of remake of ""Love Story"" except for the fact that the girl, who is Jewish rather than Italian Catholic (and a lot less attractive than Ali McGraw), doesn't die at the end. The scriptwriter Arthur Laurents in fact wrote the leading male role with Ryan O'Neal, the star of ""Love Story"", in mind.The film opens in the late 1930s when Katie Morosky and Hubbell Gardiner first meet at university. The two do not seem to have much in common. She is a working-class Jewish Marxist and president of the college branch of the Young Communist League, whereas he is from a wealthy upper-class WASP background. (At least, everyone seems to assume that Hubbell is a WASP, although his Protestantism is never actually mentioned in the film. He could equally well be a White Anglo-Saxon Catholic or White Anglo-Saxon Atheist, but WASC and WASA do not work so well as acronyms). This, however, seems to be one case where opposites attract, and Hubbell and Katie fall in love. They are temporarily separated, but meet again after the war and marry. The film then follows the subsequent history of their marriage. Perhaps the reason so little about the film remains in the memory is because it is a misty water-coloured movie. By that I am not referring to its visual style; the photography is crisp and well-defined. There is, however, something vague and insubstantial about the plot. It doesn't help that both the leads are so unsympathetic. Hubbell is good- looking and charming, but shallow and superficial, unwilling to work hard at anything. When we first meet him he has ambitions to become a writer, and clearly has talent in that direction, but after publishing his first novel never has much success, preferring to work for easy money producing scripts for Hollywood and television. As for Katie, I find it very hard to sympathise with a strident and unapologetic defender of Stalin's regime, even though Laurents obviously intended us to find her sympathetic, politics and all. One of the causes of the growing estrangement between her and Hubbell is his dismissal of her political activism, but this is one area where I felt he showed more sense than she did. The film deals with McCarthyism, but in a classical piece of solipsism fails to acknowledge that the concerns of the House Un-American Activities Committee went much further than a few blacklisted Hollywood directors and screenwriters or that the great majority of McCarthy's victims had absolutely no connection with the motion picture industry. Nor does it explore the irony of Communists like Katie invoking the protection of the American Constitution they were sworn to destroy or ask why, if they were so concerned with freedom of speech, they did not demonstrate outside the Soviet embassy demanding that Stalin extend to his own subjects the freedoms they were claiming for themselves. Another problem with the film is that too much is taken for granted and not enough explained. It purports to be a study of a marriage, but important events in the story of that marriage are rather glossed over, such as Hubbell's affair with the ex-wife of a friend. The final scene shows Hubbell and Katie meeting again in the sixties, and it is clear that they are now divorced (and Katie re-married), but the actual divorce and what led up to it are never shown. We are left to conclude that the differences in their background and temperament have made it impossible for them to live together. (To be fair to Laurents, his original screenplay was very much altered to meet the studio's demands and various other writers were brought in to contribute, which possibly explains the plot's lack of coherence). Robert Redford's rather laid-back style of acting made him a natural choice for a laid-back character like Hubbell. Casting directors from this period often liked to pair Redford with a more intensely dramatic leading lady to emphasise the contrast between their characters. Sydney Pollack, who directs here, had already done this by casting Redford opposite Natalie Wood in ""This Property Is Condemned"", as had Gene Saks (less successfully) with Jane Fonda in ""Barefoot in the Park"". (Pollock was later to make the Redford/Fonda pairing work more effectively in ""The Electric Horseman""). Certainly Barbra Streisand is at her most intense here, but she is faced with the impossible task of trying to make a Stalinist harridan into a likable human being, and we never really care about what happens to her character. On the positive side, Hamlisch's romantic and poetic musical score is a very fine one and Streisand gives a marvellous rendition of That Song. 6/10. (5/10 for the film itself, with a bonus point for the music; Hamlisch deservedly won Academy Awards for ""Best Original Dramatic Score"" and ""Best Original Song"").",The Way We Were
18,DKosty123,Notable 1st Pairing of Redford & Streisand,6,4 March 2007,"""Memories, are so beautiful & yet, they are such distant memories, of the Way We Were"". Barbara Streisand sounds great singing the title to this one. She looks good on film too.This film has some very good photography & some of those romantic scenes with Babs & Redford everyone was expecting to happen from the moment the film was announced. It is a good film.Time is 1941, pre World War 2 America. Here is Barbara on a college campus protesting American involvement in the war. The film reflects an America that doesn't exist any more. It does a pretty good job including closure on the romance between our leads.Not an essential film for viewing, but if your stuck without anything to do, a pleasant diversion.",The Way We Were
19,sddavis63,Fluffy Nothingness Neither Offends Nor Excites,4,5 July 2001,"A low key and slow paced account of the ups and downs in the romantic relationship between Hubbell Gardner (Robert Redford), a naval officer and aspiring author, and Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand), a Communist with a definite chip on her shoulder.Set largely during the period of the Roosevelt administration and the later beginnings of the ""Red Scare,"" this movie is the classic example of opposites attracting. Hubbard and Katie are as different as can be imagined. In personality, temperament, politics, sense of humour, etc., these two are polar opposites and are never truly comfortable with each other, yet are constantly drawn together by a love that neither of them really understands. It seems that there should be more than enough dramatic tension here to keep a movie going for 2 hours, but somehow the screenplay by Arthur Laurents just didn't manage any sustained flow. I would describe this as a piece of fluffy nothingness. It isn't unpleasant and there's nothing in it to offend. It's just that there really isn't all that much in it that's interesting, either. If it hadn't been for the fact that it gave us the wonderful title song sung by Barbra Streisand, I suspect this movie would have been rather quickly forgotten.I can't go any better than 4/10 on this one.",The Way We Were
20,theowinthrop,A Romance With No Winners But No Real Losers,10,31 May 2008,"Taking place in the period 1936 to 1947 (with a conclusion around the year 1960) ""The Way We Were"" is a fine ironic love story of two people (Hubble - Robert Redford - and Katie - Barbara Streisand) who meet at college and then meet accidentally during World War II in New York City, and gradually find that while they do love each other certain personality and background differences make the relationship too intense for one of them to pursue successfully. Redford is an all-American W.A.S.P. who is a ""golden boy"" with the right charisma and charm. Streisand is an activist left winger, trying to get the student population to stand up and think for themselves (while she tends to overlook her own inability to think clearly: at the start of the film she is lauding Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union for being the only ones supporting the ""Loyalist"" regime in Spain against the Fascist Franco). On the campus they never quite clicked, although Redford did show a friendly interest in ""kkkKatie the Commie"" while Streisand certainly loved looking at Redford. Redford has talent (writing a brilliant short story in the creative writing course he and Streisand attend), and later publishing other short stories, and finally a novel. Streisand reads his novel and wants to bring out his creative muse. The problem is that Redford is not as intense as Streisand on anything. He is hesitant about further novels, and he certainly is more easy going about the reality of politics. When FDR dies Streisand is in deep mourning (she thought of the President as a demigod). But Redford and his friends like J.J. (Bradford Dillman) see the reality that frequently undercuts whatever good politicians try to accomplish. Streisand gets furious at various jokes at the expense of FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt that Redford and Dillman's friends tell, not realizing that the jokes are to relieve the tension and sadness of the moment.It keeps going on like this, causing the relationship to falter, and then be rebuilt again and again. The crisis comes in Hollywood. Redford has written eight chapters of a second book, but he willingly shelves his book to concentrate on a career as a screenplay writer, working on a movie of his novel directed by George Bissinger (Patrick O'Neill). Bissinger is a liberal, and his friends include left of center types (Vivica Lindfors, Murray Hamilton), but he is a realist about what to avoid in the growing Cold War paranoia in the U.S. Both Dillman and Redford see this too. But Streisand sees only the threat to the Bill of Rights, and becomes a vocal opponent to H.U.A.C. She goes to Washington to support the ""Hollywood Ten"" writers who were blacklisted, and Redford comes to take her home. Their confrontation in an empty train station room is the point where the marriage crumbles.The Way We Were was up for several Oscars in 1973, but only won one Oscar for it's haunting and lovely theme song by Marvin Hamlisch. It has since become one of the songs (like Julie Styne's ""Don't Rain On My Parade) that are associated with Streisand, as she sang both. But it has much more going for it, including it's screenplay by Arthur Laurents and the performances in general (including supporting parts by Lois Chiles, Herb Edelman, George Gaynes, and a young James Woods). The film also was well directed by Sydney Pollack, the second of seven films Pollack did with Redford as the star. It has now become a kind of cultural icon of its own, being referred to on programs like ""Sex and the City"", ""The Gilmore Girls"", and even (in a funny stretch) ""The Nanny"". Although Pollack's Oscar was for ""Out of Africa"", and his best liked film was possibly ""Tootsie"", I think that in the long run it will be ""The Way We Were"" which will be Pollack's best remembered film.Therefore, I dedicate this review to the memory of Sydney Pollack, who died of cancer last week.",The Way We Were
21,Lejink,Stars (and stripes)-crossed lovers,5,9 November 2009,"I wasn't quite convinced by this big-star, big budget post-war Hollywood background love story and even though I was committed to watching it all the way through, it seemed to me an uneasy mix of a love-story set to the backdrop of the anti-communist witch - hunt of the day. While it has some points in its favour, I found the writing and acting of not quite the highest standard leaving a sense of unfulfilment by the end.Hollywood in the 70's was at last ready to confront openly its own shame at its treatment of left-leaning actors writers and directors (""The Front"" starring Woody Allen was soon to follow) and ""The Way We Were"" must have been something of a trailblazer in that respect which is certainly to its credit. Furthermore it's laudable to present the viewer with a deeper than usual love-story against this background, with many of the conversations of the leads debating interesting points on artistic integrity, political correctness and the shallowness of much of the general public's response to freedom-challenging issues of the day. In the end though I got the sense that director Pollack was more interested in the love story angle than the political angle (perhaps with an eye on the box-office) and this throws the film off-kilter.Streisand gets the showiest part (and, interestingly, her name in front of Redford's over the titles) and is mostly good. She's usually better when she says least (for example when Redford crudely and drunkenly ""makes"" her at her apartment) although her motor-mouth delivery obviously helps with her character's verbosity. More than once, though, you can see her acting and obviously hoping that Oscar was watching (he obviously wasn't). Redford is altogether more natural in his part as the handsome hunk with something approaching a brain but who ultimately can't accept Streisand's at times over-strident political philosophising. However one's sympathy for his character was dissipated by his turning love-rat on a now-pregnant Streisand and then abandoning her and their child almost the minute the child is born. Both these actions are loathsome in the extreme (not to mention an offensive homophobic remark he makes at another juncture) and by the time he's walking out on her for the last time at the conclusion (having also now sold-out the writing talent which Streisand alone had encouraged), you realise you've been watching a ""woman's"" film after all with the dice loaded in favour of Streisand's character. I was disappointed with this revelation as to Redford's character's true colours and felt it inconsistent with much of what had gone before.The film was obviously on a two-header basis which doesn't leave much room for the supporting actors to shine although Brad Dillman and Lois Chiles do okay with what they're given. Director Pollack keeps the narrative moving although some of the settings and costumery employed looked at times too contemporary. I'm also bound to state that I never got the impression that either lead was ageing down the years.As for the music score, while Marvin Hamlisch's title song is pretty and has obviously become a standard, I felt its strains were just too intrusive throughout and felt it should have been left a titles-only piece.A film then, at once ambitious and conservative, political and soporific, lush but talky - in the end I found it didn't enmesh these contradictions sufficiently well and missed its marks accordingly.",The Way We Were
22,ElMaruecan82,True to a certain bittersweet quality of life ...,8,16 October 2012,"At the dawn of the campus years, Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford) celebrates the first publication of one of his short stories; and Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) raises a toast ""to his first novel"". Meanwhile, he asks her why she didn't take with humor one joke made after a political speech, all she needed was to laugh at a rather benign prank and she would have won the audience. But Katie has no sense of humor whatsoever when it comes to politics and Gardiner hardly believes he can make it as a novelist. Here we are with flawed characters trying to inculcate the very value that lacks in the other: detachment and passion. And that kind of complementarity is the true basis of a realistic romance rather than a simple love at first sight or a hate-then-love formula, ""The Way We Were"", directed by Sidney Pollack in 1973, is above all these clichés.The scene I just described encapsulates the whole relationship between the Jewish, passionate and activist Katie Morosky and the classy, WASP and handsome Hubbell Gardiner. She believes in his talent, he's amazed by her passion, she's a burning fire that ignited his heart, and he embodies a sort of perfection only her eyes can value and cherish, and the way she tenderly caresses his hair is more eloquent than any description. The acting from the two leads makes the chemistry so real, so believable, that I even failed to see how the couple could be seen as 'unlikely', although the attraction between opposites is what drives the whole narrative, if not the romance. Granted Barbra Streisand is not the most attractive actress (though she has marvelous eyes, and fingernails that would turn on any fetishist) the film is definitely not about a sort of 'Beauty and the Beast' syndrome.I'm certain of this assessment even more because it's Katie who steals the show, she's the one who orchestrates the whole relationship and plays like a true mentor to Gardiner. And Redford finds the right note to play a character apparently dull, but in fact, only lacking the necessary amount of confidence because ""everything went too easily for him"". Gardiner is like the big and strong guy who was so physically impressive that he was never attacked and then could never develop self-defense mechanisms or brutality and could be dominated by smaller and weaker guys. Gardiner is blonde, good-looking, he's an accomplished athlete, and it was so easy for him to be popular that he didn't even need to build a character. He is a spineless guy and in contrast, Morosky dealt with adversity for so many years that, if not the 'Beast', she's the 'Ugly Duckling' who compensated through her courage, her ability to stand up for her ideals and transcended all her limitations.And what a character by the way, Barbra Streisand illuminates the screen with such an energy we can help but feel her enthusiasm and passion for Gardiner, but not without noticing how desperate it is. For she's the one who cares more for their relationships, and another aspect that confirms it is the whole political subtext that undermines the romance rather than accompany it. Gardiner and Morosky do complete each other but in the sense that one needs to be more passionate and gutsy, and the other more easy-going and cool, but the chemistry is always victim of political interferences. The film spans one decade but probably the richest of American history, it starts with the pre-War period when someone (Katie) could proclaim to be a Communist, to the War and it ends with the Cold War and first manifestations of McCarthysm, the era that would give a deathblow to their relationship. Yet the script isn't quite clear about the way the couple is threatened by the hearings, it widens the already existing gap between Gardiner and Morosky, as he believes that one shouldn't risk to lose everything for such abstractions as principles, people count more yet she believes that ""People are their principles"". The film features a lot of suffering, of misunderstandings, of failed attempts to change the person we love, to elevate him or her and in its own unique way. ""The Way We Were"" is the chronicle of a doomed relationship, and Pollack doesn't invite us to take side for one character, as each one is responsible for the marital failure. To a certain extent, the script remains true to a bittersweet quality of life, it doesn't even feature an obligatory 'I love you' line for that matter, and it manages to create situations we all can respond to. But now that I found out some scenes were cut out to relieve the film from its political material, I can't help but blame Pollack for having followed his audience' initial reaction (the issues are covered in the DVD features), because what's left is even more puzzling since we don't know why they broke up. We could see the rupture coming, but what was the defining moment that put an end to everything, remains unknown. And the film is too mature to get away with the excuse of infidelity; Morosky could have closed her eyes on that. At the end, ""The Way We Were"" isn't a perfect film, but it's still satisfactory, as if it was trusting the viewers not to focus on its rather anticlimactic ending, and just understand that the two leads had 'their' reasons to break up, and no matter what happens, they'll forever be the most important person of their respective lives.The movie is not without some flaws especially on the editing department, but it's kind of redeemed by the performances, the directing, a dazzling cinematography, and what's more, the sweet nostalgia induced by Marvin Hamlish's score, less emphatic than ""Doctor Zhivago"" or dramatic than ""Love Story"", it's tender enough to be listened to without distracting from the story.",The Way We Were
23,vincentlynch-moonoi,Perhaps not the classic it is sometimes seen as being,7,19 March 2011,"I don't know how it is that I never saw this film. It was smack dab in the middle of a series of films starring Robert Redford that I not only saw, but greatly admired -- ""The Candidate"", ""Jeremiah Johnson"", ""The Sting"", and ""The Great Gatsby"". And while I was not quite so enamored with the consistency of SOME of Barbra Streisand's films of the same period, I was still impressed by her impeccable voice and a number of impressive films she had starred in. Nevertheless, somehow I missed this film, and over the years chose not to watch it on cable until now.I found the bedroom scene very interesting, though illogical. True, he fell asleep right in the middle of it. But why would she have wanted to make love to him at that point? After all, he had just finished vomiting! Many of my friends had always told me I would like this movie because of its politics. While I did like the movie, politics is actually irrelevant to the first hour and ten minutes of the two hour film. It was a simple love story. Girl meets boy. Girl gets boy. Girl ALMOST loses boy, but manages to hang on and they live happily ever after...well, for a while. The problem that kept cropping up between them really wasn't her liberality, because he didn't appear to be oppositely conservative. It was really the difference between him as a college preppie and her as a sort of schlep. A class issue.However, about an hour and ten minutes into the film it does become about politics -- the Blacklist. Of course, you kinda figure out that once in the middle of the Blacklist controversy she will FINALLY become pregnant. But even then, the Blacklist is not the real story. It's simply the device to show, once and for all, that these two people, who do love each other, are mismatched. And so, girl loses boy.This is a good film, but perhaps overrated. Or maybe it's just that it is a classic love story, but not much more. The performances by Streisand and Redford are superb, and much of the cinematography is lovely. It's a really good love story...and nothing more.",The Way We Were

The film covers their relationship over the years between the late 1930s and the late 1950s. They negotiate dramatic world changes and dramatic personal changes. Through it all, the question is whether or not love alone is enough to sustain a relationship.

25,bsmith5552,The Prince and The Pauper!,7,21 November 2019,"I realize that I'm probably in the minority in not really liking this picture. It's a syrupy love story between two unlikely people that takes place over a period of some twenty years.Beginning at a College around 1937, we meet the principals, Katie (Barbra Steisand) a political activist working her way through college and preaching the virtues of communism, along with fellow activist Frankie McVeigh (James Woods) and Hubble (Hubble?) (Robert Redford) an aspiring writer who is a jock and has those blue eyes, blond wavy hair and pearly white teeth. (Tennis anyone?) . They keep running into each other but nothing really develops at this stage.Fast forward to 1940 and WWII where Katie is now working at a radio station under Bill Verso (Herb Edelman) and Hubble (Hubble?) has joined the navy and is stationed in the war torn city of Washington. Katie spots Hubble (Hubble?) asleep on a bar stool drunk in his Navy white dress uniform (How could she resist?. She takes him home to her apartment only to have him throw up, pass out and crawl into her bed stark naked. Katie seeing her chance disrobes and jumps into bed with her still unconscious guest and promptly seduces him. I'm not sure that Hubble (Hubble?) even remembers the encounter the next morning.Anyway, they become a number and move in together. Being polar opposites the couple clash when Katie expresses her unwelcome views to Hubble's (Hubble?) friends and embarasses him. They continue to disagree on their respective political views. Finally, Hubble (Hubble?) calls the whole thing off and turns in his key. Later, feeling sorry for herself, phones Hubble (Hubble?) and begs him to return. He reluctantly agrees.Fast forward to the 1950s where we find Hubble (Hubble?) a successful screen writer and Katie working somewhere in the communications industry (I think) . Enter the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) which has begun it's witch hunt of Hollywood personalities who have a past association with the Communist Party. Included among those ""worried"" are Paula Reisner (Vivica Lindfors), Brooks Carpenter (Murray Hamilton) and George Bissinger (Patrick O'Neal).Katie is ready to go to Washington in defence of those being persecuted.

This IS DEFINITELY Streisand and Redford's picture, make no mistake about it. Director Sydney Pollack's deletion of important HUAC scenes from the picture all but eliminated the roles being played by Lindfors, Hamilton and O'Neal. And I didn't find that Steisand and Redford made a likely couple. Mind you, their performances were quite good within the scope of the story but were a little unbelievable to me as a couple.

28,EUyeshima,"Streisand, Redford and Pollack All Soar But the Blacklisting Section Falls Short",8,31 December 2005,"When Carrie and the girls waxed enthusiastically about ""The Way We Were"" in an episode of HBO's ""Sex in the City"", I realized what a touchstone this movie has become for many who saw it as the ultimate opposites-attract romance. Over thirty years have elapsed since its initial release, and it's easy to forget what a massive challenge director Sydney Pollack had in making this movie. Primarily he had to harness the elephantine personality of Barbra Streisand, then the most powerful female movie star, within a period movie that was designed to provide an incisive look at the McCarthy-era witch hunts. Pollack does an exceptional job in delineating the somewhat preposterous love story, and he guides Streisand to one of her most subtle and touching performances, still her best on screen work. She was also lucky to have veteran screenwriter Arthur Laurents write such a strong, multi-dimensional character in Katie Morosky. It's quite a journey from young Communist college radical in the late thirties to glamorous Hollywood wife in the early fifties, but Streisand seems fully committed in conveying her character's idealism and blind idolatry. Matching her every step of the way is Robert Redford, who was then at the peak of his matinée idol popularity as well. He smartly underplays the lionized Hubbell Gardiner, fleshing out a character that could have remained a cipher but instead seems to understand his own limitations. It's interesting how all the other characters fade completely in the background as a result of the mega-wattage generated by the star coupling.In essence, the movie consists of three distinct parts: the college years when they first make impressions on each other, the WWII years when they meet again and start an unlikely romance, and the Hollywood years when they are married and get mired in the studio system. The first two parts are excellent and filled with memorable moments. I particularly like the intimate café scene where Hubbell announces to Katie that his article has just been published and later on when she cajoles him to stay for dinner and rattles on in typical Streisand rat-a-tat fashion about how she spent all her ration stamps on steaks and baked potatoes. Her look of realized humiliation afterward is priceless. She also handles her showcase scenes well, for instance, at the radio station when Hubbell concedes that the relationship is impossible to continue and later when Katie begs Hubbell to come over to help her sleep. I realize I was being manipulated by only-in-Hollywood, Oscar-baiting gesticulations, but the scenes somehow work regardless.When the story moves to Hollywood, the movie gets a bit more problematic. The star-crossed couple is challenged by the revelation to Hubbell's studio that Katie was a former Communist, which in turn makes Hubbell, now a rising screenwriter, a target for blacklisting. What should have been the most interesting part of the film becomes muddled as to what exactly is happening to cause their inevitable break-up. Ironically though, the film's most powerful scene is in this section, the train station confrontation between Katie and Hubbell over people and their principles. But bottom line, there is no narrative connection between the Hollywood blacklist and their separation, which just seems odd given the build-up of the story to that point. I am not certain whether reinstating several crucial scenes (cut at the last minute by Pollack) would have helped after seeing some of them in the extensive and insightful documentary included as part of the DVD package, ""The Way We Were: A Look Back"". I have to agree with Pollack (and disagree with Streisand) that the deleted scenes don't really fit in with the pacing and emotionalism during this part of the movie even though they do provide added context. Of course the coda outside the Plaza Hotel is still classic, mainly due to the brevity of dialogue, the swooning Marvin Hamlisch music and the tear-jerking stares and gestures.Despite its narrative disconnect in the last third, I still love this movie, and it does deserve its place among the great screen romances. The evocative music along with the overplayed title tune certainly adds to its impact. It's just that it doesn't belong in a sub-category of films that deal seriously with the Communist red scare. The DVD transfer is good though not exceptional, and for die-hard fans of the movie, the well-done documentary seems essential.",The Way We Were
29,nycritic,"Babs, Blondie and Incompatibility",7,19 December 2005,"Sometimes people just shouldn't get together because of a plethora of reasons -- whatever they had has died, love between a long term relationship has become a conformist monotone of days and nights, or that both parties are simply too different to coexist amicably under one roof. THE WAY WE WERE presents such a story. Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford, polar opposites in every way down to their physical features -- he's matinée idol pretty in a pre-Brad Pitt sort of way; she's just uncomfortable to look at and is a much better singer (when she's not acting) -- recreate the drawn-out story of a romance gone slowly bad due to the progressive views they both share.I don't know if it's the lead actors. I personally don't admire Babs all that much but I will say that she does carry much of the dramatic weight of the story and thus fulfils her part. (If only more attention to detail had existed to period, because the hair Babs has to sport if purely Seventies and almost distracting.) Redford, however, is a completely different story. Time has proved he's become a much better director. As an actor, all he does for the most of the film is react to Babs in a completely thankless manner so for me it wasn't that they broke up, but when it would happen. The entire film is one well-written inconclusive attempt to bring the old glamour back. Far from bad, just not all that believable where it should be.",The Way We Were
30,mossgrymk,the way we were,8,24 February 2021,"Better than most Streisand movies 'cause it's more than just a vehicle for this egotist to hog the screen, as she is wont to do. Indeed it is not too much to note that Robert Redford's golden boy turned not so golden once he's no longer a boy is a much more interesting character than Streisand's college radical loudmouth who, surprise of surprises, becomes an adult, Hollywood loudmouth! You are amused and entertained by Katie but moved by Hubbell, the fellow to whom things come too easily until they don't. The best scene in the film, in my opinion, when he and his pal J.J. (wonderfully portrayed in all his obnoxious but sad WASP-ness by Bradford Dillman) idly cruise on Hubbell's yacht, reminiscing about best days, best years, best football games, their lives effectually over by their late 30s, approaches the heartbreaking. None of the schmaltzy scenes involving the two leads come anywhere near it in the poignancy dept. Congrats to screenwriter Arthur Laurents for tapping, however fleetingly, into the Gatsby zeitgeist and director Sydney Pollack for knowing not to overdo it. I also like the way Laurents and Pollack handle the Hollywood 10 stuff in the film's second half, skillfully blending it with marital breakup while not letting the politics overwhelm the personal or vice versa.

31,bobsgrock,Mixing politics with pleasure.,6,20 June 2011,"The Way We Were tells the story of two people coming together and then falling apart. That much is apparent from the title and poster itself. The problem is not this setup so much as what happens in between, which is essentially nothing. Having understood the title and bringing in our knowledge of the history of romantic drama's inclination to force a wedge between its main characters, our only hope is to wait for the falling out moment and go from there. Again, none of this would be a problem had their been a more compelling story and situations to hold the audience's attention throughout the film. Unfortunately, that is not the case here.The sad part is, the acting is good enough to create a very tense and emotional setting. Barbra Streisand as the incredibly leftist political advocate and Robert Redford as the ""golden boy"" who gets by on a whim are both quite effective and have good chemistry together. Streisand got all the attention at the time mostly due to her extreme beauty and sparkling screen presence, yet Redford is remarkably subdued in this film and to great effect. His performance is much less noticeable than the melodramatic flairs of Streisand, yet he is the steady rock on which this romance rests upon. What this film lacks most of all is true emotion, a gripping scene or some kind of moment in which the audience is truly hooked and completely enveloped with these characters. Never for a moment are Katie or Hubbell ever so interesting as to invest two hours of our lives into theirs. That being said, this is not a bad film, just not a good one. Director Sydney Pollack maintains a steady hand in showcasing the rise of the romance and its decline, yet there seems to be a few scenes missing that needed to be included to help better understand the situation as a whole. I suppose the film is supposed to be read as a critique on extreme politicking and the turbulent times in which these characters live. Yet, the huge international and national events occurring seem to be nothing more than fodder in which to install these people. Neither are they so interesting as to capture the attention of people for a significant amount of time. Both are quite selfish and misguided and in the end come off as rather unlikable and aloof. Perhaps the only lesson to be taken from this is that politics are a volatile element in any relationship and serve little in the way of support and togetherness. Of course, that won't stop people from getting involved.",The Way We Were
32,brchthethird,Nostalgia with a dose of realism,10,21 February 2016,"In my experience of watching movies, THE WAY WE WERE is a rare bird: a romantic drama that isn't corny, has complex characters, and weaves in sociopolitical commentary without being overbearing about it. Given the title (and absolutely beautiful title song), nostalgia is one of the film's major themes. Yet nostalgia isn't approached from a purely idealistic standpoint either, as a third-act line from Hubbell (Robert Redford) indicates (""Katie, it was never uncomplicated""). The film, to a degree, is about how politics can be divisive, particularly in personal relationships, but also in one's professional life, as part of the story takes place against the backdrop of McCarthyism and the Blacklist in Hollywood. I found the whole thing to be extremely well-written and balanced, with Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford's characters each making valid points about devotion to causes, perception vs reality, and relationships. I haven't seen a lot of movies with either person, but both of them were in very good form here. And, the film had a very strong three-act structure that brought out the central relationship's development that much more. On technical matters, I thought period detail was attended to very well, with each segment/act being distinct in terms of light, color, etc. Then, there's the title song. Barbra Streisand has a beautiful voice that fit Marvin Hamlisch's music to a tee; and, the music itself did an excellent job of evoking a sense of nostalgia throughout the entire running time, appearing in various forms and instrumentation over the course of the film. It is without hesitation or reservation that I put this among one of my favorite films of all time. Everything about it just works, from the story, the acting, the music, etc. It's the kind of movie that will have you longing for the ""good old days,"" even if you never grew up during that time period.",The Way We Were
33,FilmOtaku,"Despite some faults, it's still pretty good",7,19 July 2005,"The theme of a golden boy falling for a girl from ""another world"", be it social class, the ""wrong side of the tracks"" or fill in your cliché here, is one that goes back to the silent film era. One of the most famous examples is Sydney Pollack's 1973 film ""The Way We Were"". Set from the 1930's through the 1950's, Barbra Streisand plays Katie, an outspoken member of the Communist party and campus activist who does not have anything handed to her; she works two and sometimes three jobs in order to pay for her living and college tuition. Hubble (Redford) is your typical aforementioned golden boy, a ""big man on campus"" who indulges in sports, debutantes and all-around good times. The two know each other from the diner Katie works at (he being the patron) and at one point before graduation, briefly bond over their shared passion for writing. Cut to a few years in the future and Katie encounters Hubble at a bar. Hubble is in the armed forces and Katie is characteristically working a couple of jobs while volunteering for various social causes. After a night of drunken sex (Hubble being the drunken one) they embark on an unlikely relationship that spans over a decade and includes a move to California (when Hubble becomes a screenwriter in Hollywood) and the conception of one child. They are happy, but realize that regardless of their desire, they can't completely cross social lines and certainly can't change one another, particularly Katie's ever-ferocious dedication to social causes; a fight that becomes exponentially heated during McCarthy's Red Scare. The two have to decide whether they can sustain enough raw emotion for one another to persevere over everything else that is stacked up against them.There are several things about ""The Way We Were"" that require suspension of disbelief (the fact that despite never having had much contact with one another that after one night of drunken lust and an awkward ""morning after"" being enough to kick start a relationship the magnitude of theirs is the first thing that comes to mind) but the bottom line is that it really is a well-written, well-directed and well-acted film. The two principal characters are full and complex, regardless of whether we are talking about the socially conscience Katie or the socially acceptable Hubble. I suspect they somewhat were written with the intent of familiarity for the purpose of effectiveness, and if this is true, it worked on me. The era in which these two characters were set was a very interesting time in American history, and the characters' actions during these times created some compelling cinema, particularly when it touched on the Red Scare.But who am I fooling? The main reason people watch this movie, whether for the first time or for the fiftieth is for the doomed romance, and Streisand and Redford deliver in spades. ""The Way We Were"" was written for Streisand, (something that cause Redford to turn down the part at first, because he knew the film was going to be hers) and her portrayal of Katie is excellent. There are so many perceptions of Streisand nowadays (some of them correct, to be sure) that it's easy to forget that she really does have some serious acting chops, and she exhibits them to full effect here. I also happened to learn that the soft filtered lens thing with her didn't just start with her later movies, for whatever reason she was filmed with that lens more often than not here, but that didn't do anything more than slightly distract me because I couldn't help but chuckle. Redford gives a typical solid performance as well, though his initial doubts about taking the role turned out to be valid; he is not the dynamic figure in the film. However, his character is a strong one and Redford does a good job.I don't know if Pollack knew he was creating a screen classic when he directed ""The Way We Were"" but he did make a very good film. If you can make it past some major melodrama and some plot holes (what was the deal with their child?) watch this film, and just sit back and appreciate it for what it is  a chick flick that guys don't have to feel ashamed watching. 7/10 --Shelly",The Way We Were
34,kenandraf,Failed love,9,14 July 2002,Very good romance drama film about situations where  love fails due to other factors in peoples lives.In this story one sees how love for one self can be more stronger than the love one feels for another.This leads to the relationship crumbling in time.Usually this type of relationship is more sexual attraction (physical) based.I see this as the case in this film.The cinematography here was great.The directing and chemistry between Redford and Streisnd was very good.The script/screenplay though was average.Only for romance drama fans who are mature minded and understand basic U.S. history and big fans of the lead actors......,The Way We Were

36,Dan1863Sickles,Hubble and Katie Versus Winston and Julia,3,1 July 2020,"People think of this as a timeless love story, not a dark dystopia. But did you ever notice how similar Hubble and Katie are to Winston and Julia in 1984?Winston Smith was the golden boy of the Ministry of Truth. Everything came easily to him, whether it was making up stories about the fictional adventures of Comrade Ogilvy or secretly dropping outdated facts down the Memory Hole.Then one day everything changed. It was the usual jaded crowd at the Two Minutes Hate, and Winston was goofing around with his best pal O'Brien when she walked in.""Look at the sash on that one,"" Big fat O'Brien wisecracked, carefully resettling the spectacles on the edge of his nose.""She looks like a girl who knows how phony everything is."" Winston was attracted to the dark haired girl. He could tell she hated fakes just from the way she threw her Newspeak dictionary at the telescreen. Effortlessly successful Winston Smith was turned on by her energy and passion, but also a little frightened.Secretly Winston felt himself to be the biggest fake of all.Was it ever all so simple? Or has time rewritten every line? Winston was writing in his diary, trying to remember life before the Revolution. We laughed more, and we cried more, he wrote, moved by the profound truth of his own words. As the Proles say, it was only an hopeless fancy. It passed like an April day.""Down with Big Brother! Down with Big Brother! Big Brother is Un-good! Big Brother is Un-Good!""Every day Julia stood outside the Ministry of Truth, a one woman protest movement. Sooner or later the thought police would come for her, but Winston knew he could charm them if they showed up. Winston had the golden smile. Maybe that's all he really was, the Outer Party boy with the perfect Inner Party smile.""Feel like getting some thin, watery stew with haricot beans?""""I love you,"" she whispered.They laughed together, they cried together. They made love in meadows full of bluebells, and in filthy bug-filled apartments. Winston told Julia things he had never told anyone before. His first wife didn't like sex enough to make the marriage worthwhile. He was afraid of rats eating his face.""Don't you believe in change?"" Julia asked. ""It's our duty to fight for a better future, even if it's a future we may never see!""""You're so . . . serious, Julia."" Winston felt pained by her stern and righteous nature. ""Everything that happens in the world does not happen to you personally.""O'Brien invited both of them to join his secret revolutionary movement. Winston knew it was a set up. Still he liked O'Brien. Every time he resettled his spectacles on his nose it seemed to signal that he was passionate and sincere.""We can change the world just by being passionate and sincere,"" O'Brien said solemnly.""Passionate and sincere,"" Julia echoed.Winston was naked and on top of Julia when the Thought Police came. In his terror and humiliation he suddenly realized that he had never loved Julia as much as he did right now. But it could never have lasted. Julia wanted to change the world while he just wanted to write naughty dramas for the telescreen and hang out with the Inner Party bigwigs and drink more Victory Gin.""And that's when I realized the truth,"" Winston sobbed, groveling at
O'Brien's feet in a cell somewhere deep in the Ministry of Love. ""The truth is, Julia was the one special girl. But I love Big Brother!""""It's all right, Winston,"" O'Brien said, carefully resettling his spectacles on his nose. ""Big Brother will forgive you, and you will no longer fear him after you have . . . changed. Now let's go.""Winston had always known where they would go in the end. Down in Room 101, he told the story of his love for Julia one more time. Even the rats were crying as the cage came over his face.Memories may be beautiful and yet . . . what's too painful to remember, we simply choose to forget.Winston put away his diary. Since his release, he had more time to write. Yet strangely, nothing mattered anymore. He walked alone down to the park, the cold air making his body shiver. And all at once he saw her. He saw Julia. She was protesting.""I love Big Brother! I love Big Brother! I love Big Brother!""""Looks like you've finally accepted reality,"" Winston said sadly. ""Did they torture you too?""Julia looked away. ""They made me watch that film . . . you know the one I mean. The golden boy and the bossy cow who won't shut up. It was worse than torture. I begged for them to stop. But then I realized that it was us. That was the way we were.""""The way we were,"" Winston said sadly. Those words summed it up perfectly. He felt as if he'd just lost the best part of himself. And somewhere the clocks were striking thirteen.",The Way We Were
37,oOoBarracuda,"""You're so ready to fight you don't understand anything.""",6,29 August 2016,"Sydney Pollack directed the drama romance for the ages with his 1973 feature The Way We Were. Often cited as a large influence of American directors, The Way We Were explores what identity means to different people, and just how much of our identity we will sacrifice for the ones we love. Filmed against the backdrop of the changing political climate in America between the 1930's-1960s, The Way We Were is a beautiful illustration of the depths of love and what human beings will do to love and be loved. Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford give emotion-packed performances reminding audiences why they are viewed as the acting talents that they are. Katie (Barbra Streisand) and Hubble (Robert Redford) first meet in college in the late 1930's. Katie is known as the campus activist and can most often be found organizing a protest or a sit-in somewhere around campus. Hubble, on the other hand, can most often be found on a track or football field and is known for his athletic abilities. They couldn't appear to be any more opposite until Katie learns there is a deeply creative side to Hubble that he stifles to protect his jock image. Regardless of the differences that stand in their way, the two forge a friendship, then a relationship with each other. Katie is a Jewish Marxist, and interested in the social struggle of human beings everywhere, whereas Hubble is a privileged white male that has never had to work for anything in his life. Hubble is the epitome of the type of man that Katie would usually detest, but a fledgling writer herself, she is drawn to the passionately creative side that Hubble keeps under wraps. Desperate to bring this side of Hubble to the forefront of his personality, Katie prods and prods him until he finally relents and moves to California to focus on his writing full-time. Despite their glaring differences, Hubble also relents and begins a storied relationship with Katie as the two live in California in what should be blissful unity. The couple soon learns that neither are happy in their now stifled lives. Katie feels as though she put all of her political interests on the back burner while she was pushing Hubble to pursue his writing. Hubble feels as though Katie is not really the kind of woman he wants, as he seeks the old-fashioned, doting wives of his friends. Realizing, no matter how hard they try, their union is strained and not making either one happy, Katie and Hubble must make a decision that will affect them both for the rest of their lives. The Way We Were was beautifully shot, with wonderful images of the different cities the pair lived in constantly flooding the screen. From the glorious opening shot of this film, one can see that the camera work in The Way We Were is above compare. The rich coloration throughout the film really aids in the understanding of how infused the love between Katie and Hubble was. The acting was a treat in this film. From the understated hopelessly in love James Woods to the captivating chemistry between Streisand and Redford; there is no shortage of on-screen talent in any scene in this film. The pacing of this film was a little slow but is easily forgiven because of the way the slow pace allows the audience to see how at times deep, and at times agonizing the love is between Katie and Hubble. At one point or another in their lives together, Katie and Hubble are both making immense sacrifices of themselves. As their identities mature and develop in unison with each other, they are also at times both sacrificing themselves for the other. The overarching question becomes, just how much identity one is willing to sacrifice for the other. If you are fortunate enough to discover your own identity, never lose it for that of another. Many people navigate life never knowing themselves, let alone ever really knowing someone else. Love is essential to human existence, but not living true to oneself can end one's existence; The Way We Were is a beautiful illustration and reminder of such concepts.",The Way We Were
38,dfle3,Odd couple romance that goes off on a tangent,7,11 March 2009,"This movie seems very much a star vehicle for singer Barbra Streisand, who plays undergraduate student Katie Morosky. Set in 1930's America at the start of the movie, Morosky is a politically active communist on campus, who hands out flyers and speaks at anti-war rallies. The man who will become her love interest is Hubbell Gardiner, played by Robert Redford. Gardiner is more a part of the elite than Morosky and is not politically active at all...he's more hedonistic, hence their being a potential odd couple.For this early part of the movie, you have to suspend disbelief over how much older Streisand and Redford seem in relation to the characters they play. In other words, they look too old for their parts. However, Redford gives a completely winning performance early in the piece as an undergraduate student. He is all easy charm, manners, and engagingly amusing to boot...in contrast to oh so serious Morosky.Now, not being versed in the history of this production, it does come across as Streisand pulling all of the strings. She is not a conventional leading lady, and her pairing with Redford would not seem an obvious choice. To me, their early attraction was glossed over, which made Morosky seem a little bit creepy when she does get into bed with Gardiner for the first time! So, if Streisand did pull a lot of strings to make this movie, it perhaps represents some 'wish fulfilment' on her part! And, as if to explain her presence in this film, Morosky does say some things which seem to have psychoanalytical weight for Streisand's own situation (i.e. Morosky's views on her looks, which may engage the audience member wondering why Streisand is paired with Redford).The undergraduate Morosky may seem a tad annoying early on, but the more mature Morosky does engage more...not being so militant, and ridding herself of that overgrown mop of hair on her head which didn't sit right with me. It's then that it becomes more understandable why Gardiner would be attracted to her.Theirs is an intriguing relationship, especially in how Morosky deals with Gardiner's friends, who are more like him than her. During the period that they are in university together (or maybe it's called 'college' in the US), attention is paid to Gardiner's writing ability. It is this part of the story that will later have a life of its own in the movie. Initially this branch of the story seemed quite odd...why focus on this if this is meant to be a love story? Things become clearer later on, as the historical context of the film's setting becomes clearer. This historical context may prove to be an eye-opener for Americans who are ""Generation X"" or ""Generation Y"".When I jotted down notes on this film, I wrote: ""The ending is sort of established, so, like the start, you wonder about the specifics"". Hmmm, not sure what I meant by that!Anyway, I give this film 65/100. Intriguing, and Redford shows his star qualities here-the Brad Pitt of his day.",The Way We Were
39,MelbaMan1,Streisand And Redford At Their Best,8,11 April 2018,"One of the screen's greatest romantic films. But it could have been a whole lot better. The scenes with Streisand and Redford together are lovely. Best when there is a tinge of wistful nostalgia and sadness in the plot. Unusual to have an intelligent romance in a film, as well as literary characters. But the political narrative is not handled well and becomes muddled. Maybe that and the Hollywood part of the plot could have been better directed.
Beautiful score and title song won Oscars. Laurents could have won one for the screenplay too if it had been treated differently. 
Streisand and Redford are perfectly cast and are at their best.
I love how marriage and divorce are never mentioned specifically. We never see the child and Hubbell's new wife (whose name we are not told) is all but invisible in her scene. I suppose this is to keep the plot as true as possible to its origin as a gay love story (before same sex marriage and adoption rights were legal).",The Way We Were
40,sunznc,"Moving, dramatic and very well done.",9,4 July 2011,"The film is very well made. Everything here top notch from the acting all the way down to the sets. Robert Redford is too old for the very early college scenes in my opinion but perfect as the film progress' and the lead characters get older. Could they have used a younger actor in the very early scenes? Who knows? He does a very, very good job with the part though and after viewing the film it's hard to imagine anyone else in that role.It doesn't really matter anyway because once the film gets going the viewer becomes absorbed in the story which is very good. There are times when it becomes a bit soapy and melodramatic especially since some scenes were cut out changing the reason for the couple's problems in their relationship. The film is sad and the very last scenes are bittersweet. I think most people will relate to the feelings of the lead characters though and because the acting is so very good up the end you can't help but understand both characters and you want them both to be happy. I think a lot of people will want this film to stay in their collection.",The Way We Were
41,roghache,Vintage romance between conflicting ideologies,7,23 March 2006,"When I first saw this movie after its release, I was quite enthralled but suspect, having matured somewhat, I might be considerably less so today.The film chronicles, over a period of two decades (1930's to 1950's), the tempestuous romance between two opposites. When they first meet in college, Katie is an outspoken Jewish, liberal (no, Communist) activist, working hard to put herself through school. Hubbell is a wealthy, conservative, golden boy WASP, more interested in sports than in causes. When they meet up again some years later, they have a romance that leads to pregnancy, get married, and move to California. However, by now it's getting into a politically volatile era where people are being blacklisted as Communist sympathizers, and their ideological differences cause problems...This movie is for me, memorable mainly for the amazing on screen chemistry between its two very adept stars, Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford (perfect in their roles here), the immortal tearjerker ending, and the song The Way We Were.Reading the commentary, I somewhat agree with other reviewers that, even though Katie has remarried, the idea of Hubbell abandoning his daughter, of having no contact with her whatsoever, is not very endearing. However, times were different during that era, and custody or visitation back and forth between New York (Katie) and California (Hubbell) would have proved difficult and unusual. Truthfully, the kindest thing he may have done for his daughter, assuming Katie's current husband to be a loving and decent man, is exactly what he did...stay completely out of the picture and let his daughter have one consistent male parent, the step father. So, while Hubbell on the surface appears selfish and negligent in his parental responsibilities...This film is a classic romance from my college years, and as such I remember it fondly. It's a testament to a quotation I once heard to the effect that a happy marriage does not depend upon the two people looking at each other, but in them both looking outward in the same direction. I guess we have a demonstration of this here with the apparently insurmountable obstacles faced by Katie and Hubbell.",The Way We Were
42,disinterested_spectator,The Way We Were and the Way We Are,8,26 December 2014,"This movie begins in 1944. Katie runs into Hubbell, a good-looking guy she met in college and whom she had a crush on. But as she is rather homely, her love for him was hopelessly unrequited. She invites him up to her place for a cup of coffee, but he is so drunk that without realizing what he is doing when he comes out of the bathroom, he gets undressed and falls asleep in her bed. She gets naked, slides into bed with him, and encourages him. Without really knowing what he is doing, he has sex with her, and she hopes he knows it is Katie he is making love to. But by the next morning, it is clear that he has no memory of what happened, and he merely thanks her for letting him sleep there.In evaluating this scene, we must do so from the vantage points of three different periods: the end of World War II, when the scene took place; the early 1970s, when the movie was made; and the twenty-first century, when we watch this movie today. In other words, each of these three different periods will tend to yield three different moral judgments about that sex scene.But first, let us reverse the sexes. By today's standards, if a man were to have sex with a woman while she was too drunk to know what she was doing, that would be rape, for she would be in no condition to consent. However, in accordance with twenty-first century egalitarianism, we would not limit it to just a man doing that to a woman. Rather, we would say that if one person had sex with a second person when that second person was too drunk to know what he or she was doing, then the first person has raped the second person. This allows for the possibility that a woman could rape a man, a man could rape a man, and a woman could rape a woman. In other words, by today's standards, Katie raped Hubbell.In 1944, when the scene took place, if it had come to light what Katie had done, no one would have called it rape. Katie's behavior would have been condemned, but not as an act of rape. Rather, she would have been regarded as a slut, in that she had sex without being married. And in no way would Hubbell have been thought of as victimized.In 1973, when the movie was made, the people who made this movie probably did not think of it as rape either. And given the fact that it was made after the sexual revolution, what Katie did would not have been condemned as slutty either. In other words, the audience of the early 1970s would not have been inclined to condemn Katie at all.In fact, the people who made the movie in 1973 probably had no idea that over forty years later this scene would challenge our willingness to apply a single standard to both men and women when it comes to rape. In other words, if a man who takes advantage of a drunk woman can be charged with rape and sentenced to a year in prison, should the same sentence be given to a woman who does that to a man? In particular, if ""The Way We Were"" were set in the twenty-first century, would we say that Katie should have gone to prison for what she did to Hubbell?Some people might argue that since she and Hubbell later fell in love and got married, that made it all right. But suppose a twenty-first-century Hubbell were to realize what happened when he woke up the next morning. And let us further assume that this twenty-first century Hubbell was outraged and felt disgusted by what happened. Under those circumstances, should Katie spend a year in prison?I confess that I have a double standard concerning rape in such a circumstance. First, I would find it hard to believe that even a twenty-first century Hubbell would be all that put out by what she did. And second, I would not want to see Katie go to prison in any event.But my views are not important. What is important is that this scene in the movie, imagined to take place today, tests our willingness to apply a single standard to both men and women in such cases. Most people I know, after some hesitation, will admit that they would not want to see Katie do hard time.",The Way We Were
43,RealLiveClaude,A reminder they don't do movies like this anymore... And Barbra shines here !,8,18 February 2019,"Love the song, sung by Barbra in this movie (and not forget the later version from Gladys Knight).At the time, Sydney Pollack did great movies and knew how to use its main stars. If Robert Redford does a good job here, Barbra Streisand steals the show all the way and in a story which most of the romantic couples face sometimes (works good at first, then all break loose and finally the love is gone, but not the respect for each other). Finally, this is a movie which can be watched to remember that good times/bad times happen, but there is always a spark somewhere.And Sydney Pollack did the job well. Later, he would greatly succeed with ""Out of Africa"", which stars again...

44,stevenfallonnyc,EXTREMELY overrated!,1,28 January 2003,"I finally watched Babs' big legendary flick with Robert Redford, and it wasn't anything nearly as good as I had heard. I was disappointed that it was set in the 40's, I was it was set the year the film was made, 1973, because I wanted to see an early 70's looking Babs, but she still looked pretty in her 40's garb anyway. But about Redford  I like him but he's definitely not that great of an actor. But he's ok. I recently saw `Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' with him and Paul Newman for the first time, and Newman completely wiped the floor with Redford without half trying. As far as those `70's good looking leading men' types, he pales next to Burt Reynolds, who has tons more screen charisma. Because of Redford's inability to set the screen on fire, and Streisand's overacting and the two of them generating no real chemistry  the big love affair here falls pretty flat. Redford has some chemistry with Lois Chiles though, who of course appeared later in the 007 film Moonraker.But Babs' role - Barbara is cast GREAT   she plays a left-wing liberal extremist communist! What do you know! And I mean that literally  her character is a communist, and even leads a group called `The Communist Youth League!' Even bigger `shock' was in the DVD `making of' documentary, where Babs and the screenwriter both say how perfect she was for the part of a communist, with Barbara herself saying how she `felt' for the character. Nice! Take that as you will.Of course, Barbara's communist ways go out the window when she demands $13 million dollars for every concert she performs, causing ticket prices to even reach into the thousands. Her extreme leftist politics often dominate Babs' character in the film, often ignoring Redford's pleas for her to lighten up a little, and in true fashion, she can't even resist telling Redford that his director (of his writing in Hollywood) `is an idiot' because she doesn't agree with his politics. How perfect!One telling scene features leftist Babs looking to `shut the other guy up' by going up to a man passing out Dewey fliers, she lies to his face saying `she wants to help,' grabs a big pile of fliers to ""help"" pass out, but instead walks down the street and throws them in the trash. Hmmm...Babs, after a decent start, eventually gets `in your face' a lot in the flick, and goes off on ranting tangents very reminiscent of her style in the comedy `For Pete's Sake.' She then starts to become intolerable to everyone around her, including the one guy who put up with her the most in the film, Redford's character. At one point, Redford's character says sternly to Barbara's, after she whines to some of his friends who are taking FDR's death more easily than Barbara is, `it just didn't happen to you! Everything in the world that happens does not just happen to you personally! Now behave yourself!' What do you think would happen in Barbara's house if James Brolin tried to pull that routine on her!Even as the politics start to overpower the `love story,' it makes no difference as the big love story wasn't that great to begin with. But it does make the film more interesting to watch, especially when Redford constantly tells Babs that her commie ways are a detriment. During one political demonstration where Babs can't keep her mouth shut (like I said, great casting) someone has a great line, `shut your mouth, you commie bitch!' Unfortunately, she doesn't, and Redford gets beat up defending her, which sucks because he's been wanting her to shut her mouth since the start of the picture. Redford then accuses Babs of coming to Hollywood strictly to spread her commie leftist views. They argue and Redford swipes the tableware to the floor. Cool! Again, all the while Communist Babs is making no effort whatsoever to leave the posh lifestyle that Redford's writing success in Hollywood has given her. Just like the real Babs! (She does say how she hates the ""means"" though, his writing, the films, and even the palm trees. But she'll enjoy the fruits of the means.)So really, `The Way We Were' really falls flat as a big romance. Actually, the only time I remotely felt anything for the two leads is at the end, when they have gone on to separate lives and Babs happens to spot Redford in NYC (it's so easy you know) and they share a last hug, that wasn't bad, but it was mostly because Redford actually showed some acting talent in the film and had a few convincing looks on his face. Then as Babs goes back to passing out her commie flyers on the street, the main song plays (again) and the credits roll. The song is good, but we've heard the melody many times during the actual film, so thankfully we don't hear the whole song after the film finishes. The movie IMO would have been better if they had someone who was more in sync with Redford, who was the real star of this picture despite his second billing, because Barbara just wasn't a good match for him. Perhaps this was realized and why in her next film, `For Pete's Sake,' she played a ranting girl in modern Brooklyn alongside Michael Sarrazin in a comedy! And unbelievably, they even included the `For Pete's Sake' trailer on the `The Way We Were' DVD! `The Way We Were' is a horrible, horrible mess.",The Way We Were
45,brefane,Diabetics beware!,2,1 February 2009,"Terrible and talky schmaltz that ladles on the syrupy score at regular intervals, and the Oscar winning title song is probably the most notable thing about this Barbra Streisand vehicle in which no one else has a chance to register and the supporting roles feel more like cameos, and her hair, which is commented on throughout the film by various characters, deserves star billing. As Katie, a woman more or less equally in love with Robert Redford and her own social consciousness, Streisand looks good and is sometimes affecting, but neither she nor Redford are convincingly collegiate in their early scenes, and in the latter scenes that awkwardly and simplistically deal with the McCarthy era, both characters and their arguments become wearying. Neither the actors nor the details are persuasively period. And Redford is awful; his charm is studied, and he looks at Streisand with incredulity. Besides, his character is a dull, glib, deadbeat who seems to have majored in hairspray. Sydney Pollack who directed Tootsie and They Shoot Horses, Don't They? has done nothing to offset the film's inherent triteness, indeed he revels in clichés!",The Way We Were
46,GeoPierpont,Beauty and the Beast...yet again!,5,8 January 2014,"After Funny Girl, Mirror Has Two Faces, Yentl, etc., never made the correlation of the same ol' same ol' script for Ms. Fabs.... Always the fish out of water, trying so hard to compensate and too many color coded mugs to count... Always loved those exceedingly long deep red nails and figured hmmmmm.... reminds me of 1937!! Did she wear super bells (bottoms) when lounging with Roberto on their beach front home in Malibu?? Who was the costume supervisor on this??? OK won't address the hair (OY) or war time phrasing, so onto that deep plot device.... Redford in UNIFORM!!! As usual he was very pleasing to the eye as well as devoid of consciousness, nonetheless an infield homerun.After watching ""On the Waterfront"", and reading about the implied Kazan apology, never appreciated the impact of being a Communist in the US. I was rather shocked to see rallies for the ""Party"" and that it seemed the right path to take for many citizens. Is this historical aspect correct? I am one of those on the bandwagon for political change and represent the proverbial broken record during many discussions. Only to fall on deaf ears as many just do not have the time or inclination to find out what really is occurring behind the scenes. So I definitely related to the character but would NEVER hook up with some clueless dude who, at the least, enjoyed the joke about Mrs. Roosevelt in the Coal Mines, moronic! Made no sense to me especially when you see her ROWING the boat in the harbor, it cracks me up to think she had to once again do all the work to make him love her... Also, his piece de resistance book, ""All the world is Ice Cream"" (sic) and how he was given everything, complete dullsville, he didn't even have mega cash like Omar... hence, was perplexed with this effort and can only recommend for the theme song, strong long nails, and Hollywood anathema... sigh",The Way We Were

48,mrcaw1,One of the best movies of the 70s.......,10,24 February 2004,"Contains Spoiler I read some of the comments registered here on The Way We Were and felt I needed to add my comments.First of all, I think a lot of people are viewing this movie through politically correct, 21st century eyes.Comments have been made about Redford's character ""abandoning"" his kid after he splits with Streisand's character at the end of the movie. However, the movie implies that Streisand's character moves from California back to New York while Redford's character stays in sunny Hollywood. If this were the case, back in the 1940s it was not as common for people to hop on a plane going from coast to coast. It would not be uncommon at that time for a woman to remarry (which Streisand's character does) and have her new husband basically raise the kid. Especially if the natural father was (as in this case) across the other side of the country. Societal customs were much different than they are now concerning extended families and such.
The two sides of the country also represent the main characters. Sunny, beautiful, extroverted, physically inclined Hollywood (Redford) on the west coast and the grayer, more complex, intellectually inclined New York on the east coast (Streisand).I'm also surprised at the comments regarding the characters motivations in finding the other attractive. I thought the movie made it very clear & believable. Both characters are acutely aware of their projected image to others and both characters feel trapped by these labels. This is something very significant that they share which bonds them. Redford's character chafes at his pretty boy image yet is at the same time uncomfortable in the role of writer.  When his short story is read in class, he is visibly uncomfortable yet still wants the approval of his classmates. Redford's character wants to be strong yet have a vulnerable artistic side appreciated. So too is Streisand hampered by her image as an intellectual, wise cracking, thick skinned rebel. She, unconsciously perhaps, longs for a man to treat her gently, appreciate her as something more than a spokesperson, more as a unique person, a woman.Each of the characters tentatively pin pricks the other's exterior reserve. Redford by trying to make Streisand smile, relax, not take life so seriously and Streisand by trying to make Redford feel respected and have his writing valued. Each receives from the other something most people won't give them. Streisand is made to feel beautiful and interesting and sexy and something more than just her political beliefs while Streisand lets Redford know that beneath the blond surfer boy looks she sees depth and integrity.The movie also deals with culture clashes within society. Redford's character is the classic White Anglo Saxon Protestant upper class while Streisand the lower class ethnic, non-Christian. That they even consider forging a relationship between the two of them would have raised eyebrows at the time.I'm surprised (though perhaps I missed it) that no one commented on two of the films most famous lines. In an argument near the end of the movie Redford & Streisand battle it out with Redford declaring that people are more important than principles with Streisand answering back that people are their principles.I agree with many that this is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood in the 1970s. I think both lead actors were perfectly cast and the period feeling of the WWII era is beautifully rendered.There are many wonderful ""moments"" throughout the film. The scene where Redford is out in the ocean on a small sailboat with his good friend and the two are playing the ""best ever"" game. When the friend calls out the category as year and Redford starts identifying first one year then another then another as his best or favorite years the viewer knows without being told that the years he's listing are his years he's spent with Streisand. The camera records Redford's bittersweet face and pulls back, showing the friend on the boat silently witnessing his friend's pain, then the camera pulls back in a helicopter shot showing the boat being bounced on the waves. It's an extraordinarily poignant moment in film.As mentioned in other reviews, the shots of Streisand brushing back Redford's hair off his forehead are sexy and intimate without being graphic.Another moment I love is near the end of the film and Streisand says to Redford wouldn't it be wonderful if the two of them were old and they would have survived all of this. Again, with brilliantly written dialogue and performed by professionals the movie accomplishes much depth without resorting to histrionics.I think it's a very romantic film along the lines of Casablanca and Gone With The Wind and Brief Encounter.I say, rent the film, don't try to over analyze it, just relax on the couch either by yourself or with your partner and just enjoy an old fashioned story of boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy loses girl in the end.",The Way We Were
49,Gideon24,One of my favorite movie romances,8,3 March 2015,"The ultimate chick flick, 1974's The Way We Were follows Katie Morofsky, a serious-minded college student and radical who works overtime at very liberal political causes that have developed through the turmoil of WWII and though she is the hardest working gal on campus, things don't always go as effortlessly for her as she would like.Enter into Katie's life a guy named Hubbell Gardner (Robert Redford),a golden boy to whom everything comes easy and who takes life as it comes. Katie and Hubbell meet in college and she is immediately smitten with him, though she tries to fight it. Hubbell admires Katie's spirit, though he doesn't really love her, and from this springs one of the most moving and beautiful love stories ever put on celluloid, ending during the early 1960's.This movie draws you in immediately because Katie and Hubbell are both people that we can relate to and we understand their feelings for each other from the beginning and even though these people are polar opposites, we want to see them make this relationship work, which is further complicated by their conflicting political convictions. Katie is all about making a difference in the world and Hubbell wants to take things as they come and not quite as seriously as Katie does.The on screen chemistry between Streisand and Redford is off the charts and Streisand had to fight hard to get Redford to do the film. He rejected the role after reading the original script and Streisand had re-writes done immediately in order to beef up Hubbell's role.Pollack's sensitive direction and effective support from Bradford Dillman, Patrick O'Neal, and Viveca Lindfors also deserve mention here, but it is the magic chemistry generated by Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford that made this movie the instant classic it became. Needless to say, the classic Oscar winning theme song, flawlessly performed by Streisand, didn't hurt.",The Way We Were
50,zfiany,This is one good movie that was unfairly treated by audience,7,20 November 2009,"It's a very good movie that was unfairly treated by audience though it had many true messages. The movie talked about a point that is rarely dealt with in romantic stories specially the new ones that stray away a lot from reality. The point is when two are in love but have different perspectives to life. It's truly a major issue in any relationship and was honestly dealt with in this movie because in the beginning when the passion is too strong both parties show the willingness to compromise but later when life takes over and time starts slowly killing this passion, both can tolerate the difference no more! I loved so much the final scene when he sees her in the street and goes to say hi. She invites him to the house to see his own daughter but he refuses to saying: ""You know I can't!"". Waw! It means he is still in love with her because when a love that is too strong passes by you once, you know you will not forget it but you know that you can bury it alive! Both actors Redford and Streisand were amazing in their roles and couldn't have though of somebody else replacing them. The roles were truly made for them.",The Way We Were
51,Davalon-Davalon,Questionable Pleasure,4,29 December 2012,"I was relatively young when this film first came out. I, like many others, thought it was great, and loved Streisand and Redford and the theme song. I recently saw TWWW again, nearly 40 years later, and my opinion has changed dramatically. I cannot deny that Redford and Streisand definitely seem to have some kind of chemistry. And, as I felt the first time, Barbra represented every ugly duckling, gay or straight, who somehow manages to capture the prize. Via Barbra's performance, we can easily imagine what it must have been like to lie down with a prince. This, I think, may be one reason why the film had a certain level of success. Barbra also had moments where she ""spoke the truth"" with passion and intensity. I think people related to this outspokenness, this gutsiness, this willingness to take chances and not apologize for one's opinions. Barbra was also the ""outsider"" -- she was the smart Jewish girl who knew she had to work harder, study more, and fight for what she wanted, because nothing would come to her easily. It is for these reasons why I think the movie resonated. But the reality is: The movie is not about anything, not really. What, exactly, is the plot? They meet in school, they meet years later, they fall in love, they get married, he has an affair, they divorce, they meet again... okay, so what? Barbra, who does have tons of talent, but in this film looked like she was performing her graduate project for Acting 101, spends a lot of time arguing and getting upset about things. But whatever those things are seem to be only tangentially connected/related to the rest of the story (if you can call it that). Bob, yes, stunning to look at, coasts through the film with little to do or say. He didn't want to do the film, and I can see why. Yeah, he looks great, but what is the emotional arc of his character? A lot was cut from this film and as a result, it seems disjointed. There is an inordinate amount of time spent on Bob's career as a screenwriter in Hollywood while a pregnant Barbra tends to their little beach house. And yet everyone seems miserable and unhappy. Voices were raised, but nothing really happens. Near the end when Barbra has apparently given birth to their child (after it's clear that their relationship is over), Bob shows up at the hospital. Barbra is perfectly coiffed and made-up as if she's just come back from a spa. He stands there, emotionless, ready to abandon her and their newborn child. We're supposed to like him? I couldn't stand him. In fact, James Wood, who we meet early on in the film, who seems to be Barbra's quasi-boyfriend in college and who seems to support everything she was trying to do, is clearly a better man for her--but he wasn't as handsome. Life is cruel, isn't it? Finally, the theme song: Yes, it is a beautiful song for what it is and Barbra sings it beautifully. Who knew that it would become an iconic song and help define her career? She didn't even want to sing the song--she felt it was too simple. She had to be talked into it. So, finally, in the end, what are we left with? A unique opportunity to see Barbra and Bob dressing in period costumes, lots of bad, bad lighting, a plot-less rambling ""story"" that does not stay any one place long enough for us to care about much of anything, lots of intense arguing and challenging others from Barbra, and lots of stoic looks from Bob. And yet, it was a big hit. Like I said at the beginning, it was Barbra's ""ugly duckling"" status and ""landing the prince"" that I think resonated with a large part of the audience. At least it did with me... back then. At this point in time, I just kind of stared at it in amazement and said, ""What exactly is this all about?""",The Way We Were
52,robb_772,The best film romance for adult audiences,10,20 April 2006,"As stated many times before, THE WAY WE WERE is one of only a handful of romantic blockbusters to actually feature an intelligent script and complex characters. Writer Arthur Luarents' based his screenplay (and subsequent novel) on girl he knew in college, who fought for liberal (and sometimes communist) causes. Three decades after it's release, THE WAY WE WERE remains one of the few cinematic depictions of the Red Scare that swept America in the forties and fifties; the backdrop of which lends the surrounding love story greater potency and depth. The film was a surprise box office smash when originally released, and became the fifth-highest grossing film of 1973 and was instantly embraced as a classic.Katie Morosky is a character that Barbra Streisand born play, and she delivers on all accounts. Fierce and determined, yet vulnerable and self-conscious, Katie is a tricky character and Streisand inhabits her so deeply that she seems nothing less than completely believable. Justifiably nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, she inexplicably lost to Glenda Jackson's shrill performance in the barely remembered A TOUCH OF CLASS. This was clearly a major blunder on the side of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Robert Redford, who had actually turned down the role twice before director and friend Sydney Pollack talked him into taking the part, displays some of the best reflective acting ever seen on the big screen and effectively brings forth the dark side of being stereotyped as the All-American golden boy (although Redford did not receive an Oscar nod for playing Hubbell in this film, he was nominated for Best Actor that same year for his light comedic performance in THE STING).THE WAY WE WERE is different from most romances in that it is not death, feuding families, or any other societal phenomena that directly tear the couple apart. Katie and Hubbell are simply passionate individuals with highly volatile, and contrasting, ideologies; the conflict of which is expressed in several brilliantly written and acted scenes that shimmer with the type of intelligence and honesty that is rarely seen in cinema today. The film's enduring popular success with the mass audience may very well be due to the magnetic chemistry between Streisand and Redford, the gorgeous cinematography, and the strong directorial hand supplied by Pollack. However, it is the complexity of the romance with politics and the strong characterizations by both leads that continues to make THE WAY WE WERE the best love story for adults.",The Way We Were
53,macpet49-1,The Way We Weren't!,3,22 April 2007,"With all due respect to Barbara, this is one of the corniest, glum,sentimental movies about a Hollywood that wasn't that ever was! First, the production designer and costume designer ought to be banned from ever working again--1970s clothing and feeling that is supposed to be the thirties and war years. Barbara's hair is either a Harpo fright wig (not in the style of the 30s glamour gals at all) or a stiff lacquered curl-infested bouffant so unlike the 1940s that I could puke. What a mess. I haven't even begun to mention the schmaltzy dialogue that is tripe intended to push all our 1960s baby boomer buttons! Was the scriptwriter 12 years old or just drunk? What was Babs thinking? Did she think after 'Funny Girl' and 'What's Up Doc?' that she could do no wrong? Oy, vhat a messy, schmessy malt-filled soda pop bag of baloney this is. My favorite scene is when she is screaming in a bar at Redford over his lack of political correctness wearing a snood the size of New Jersey. Half of the ideas they pose in argument hadn't even been thought of yet, in the 40s. These were the years of the so-called 'greatest generation' (I take offense at that too having been raised by 2 of them) who rolled up their sleeves, sent their men off to die without questioning, and worked in the factories making bombs for the US of A. These people never questioned anything until the 1960s rolled along and after Vietnam it became fashionable to reject. If I am a child of Kennedy, they were children of FDR who basically like a father for years gave them the illusion that all would be well until he died and it obviously was not so well (remember Yalta). They were the 'cocktail generation' who worried more about possessions than baby boomers ever could. It was the time of keep up with the Jones' at all cost--conformity ruled! We never heard about dissenters until the civil rights issues revved up the nation in the late 50s and early 60s. If people suspected McCarthy was wrong, they never talked about it, even behind closed doors. They poured another drink, spun out and slept through the fifties surrounded by their pink and aqua bathrooms and cars and TV sets. I remember, I was there. So, if all you want is to see Babs and Rob in their prime, this is the pic for you. If you want your brain teased and disturbed or challenged, go rent a foreign film.

54,jimakros,the movie that sold Redford and Streisand and the song,8,26 December 2009,"I read some of the criticizing comments about this movie and many of them have valid points about some aspects of this movie,like the relationship,the politics,the ending etc. but they are also missing the point.The point of this movie are not the characters but how Redford and Streisand themselves were identified with these characters.This movie sold successfully both of them as new stereotypes to the world audiences.Redford plays the Golden Boy and thats how he was known from then on.And Streisand plays the unstoppable,energetic,dynamic personality and thats pretty much her image. I was in my early teens then and i remember almost all the girls in my HS had photos of Redford from this movie.The guy became THE sex symbol of that time from this movie.There's the scene where Streisand sees Redford sitting at a barstool at ElMorocco,with his eyes closed and from the way of her expression the audience understands she is just knocked out by his looks.Which is really what this movie is all about.The audience sees Redford(its his face that is important not the character) through the eyes of Katie-Streisand and millions of girls and mature women identified with her and a new male sexsymbol was born.This type of blond boyish hero was not really anything Hollywood had before.The archtypical leading man had been Clark Gable,a dark masculine and dynamic man,while this Redford doll-type person was a new kind of feminine fantasy.On the other hand,Streisand-Katie was the dynamic,energetic and forceful woman,a kind of pre-feminist who wanted that blond boyish guy the way men like blond starlets.This movie created a stereotype for her too.So here the roles are really reversed,and this goes on in the entire movie,where Redfords character is really the more passive one and Streisands is the more forceful one.Its the reason Redford hated this character and didn't want to play it in the first place.But ironically,his image as a matinée idol was created mostly from this movie.So folks,this was it.Most people my age who had seen this movie when it came out don't even remember the story.They remember Redford and Streisand,and -OH-and THE SONG.",The Way We Were

The music by the way is fine and the song that still brings a tear to my eyes is the definitive divorcée cri de coeur. the movie however is a piece of junk for several reasons. The only decent performance is from the ever reliable Brad Dillman. Redford can't do Republican because he is simply a boy and can't play a man. Newman could but Redford even at 70 is still too emotionally flabby. As for La Streisand. She is an excellent communist. She's been playing the part to perfection for years and I have no problem with that but sentimental, good mom and woman in love who actually feels love for a human being, not in this life. I don't mind her quirky looks and even liked Yentl but this is a mess from beginning to end. Rachel had the right idea (stay away and out of the movie and the lives of these losers).

57,fred-houpt,"""Oh, but look what I've got""......",10,5 October 2009,"One of the tests of a good film is to watch it many years later and see if the material has aged well. After not seeing it for a very long time I sat down last night and played it. I can gladly say that the film has aged very well and is every bit as solid and moving as when I first saw it. Barbara is as beautiful as she ever was in any film. Redford made legions of ladies swoon with his natural, rugged, non-tampered handsome blondness.The story is quite believable and borrows from the historical record that it is placed in. There were lots of Jewish people who got caught up in the anti-Fascist, anti-war and anti-bomb movements. But the actual beliefs or disinterested lifestyles, although well articulated in the film are secondary throughout, helping to craft the tensions that underscore the real theme: romantic but inevitably doomed love.Streisand and Redford threw themselves into this work and their on screen chemistry is wonderful. Barbara's singing of the theme music pulls at the heart strings as it is meant to. This is a beautiful and adult drama that reminds anyone who has lived through disappointment and heartbreak in love what it was all about. One of the best films for both actors. For me only ""Yentl"" eclipses Barbara's success on screen. Watch for a very young James Woods early in the film. Keep the Kleenex box close by. Still one of my favourites.",The Way We Were
58,Streetwolf,a lovely movie with a terrible ending.,7,15 February 2002,"Summary: The movie starts out from their first meeting after high school where Hubbell has become a navy officer and Katie works at a radio station. Whilst their meeting we go and see how they met in high school.Hubbell is the popular guy in school with the best looking girl and the star athlete. Katie is a rising peace keeper, who fights for everything with everything for just about everything. When she realizes that Hubbell has a talent of becoming a writer she encourages him and the two become friends even though Katie doesn't like his friends because they like to make jokes about everything she works hard for yet she starts to fall in love with Hubbell thinking that she understands what she is doing...that and the fact that he is perfect! Back to the moment they meet for the first time after school things slowly start to happen between the two and they get involved,even though she believes she is lucky to have someone like him and he looks up to her for the way she understands everything better than he does, but with their different prospectives on everything they start to drift apart.Robert Redford plays Hubbell and we all get to see a side of Redford as the charismatic, charming, gorgeous man that he is whereas Barbara Streisand comes in as Katie, the strong minded young woman, who wants to have the whole world her way. There is a small appearance of a very young James Wood. I didn't recognize him at first, but it was him all right!Personally i did expect more, but with the characters still in love all through the movie there seems to be no room for them to compromise and live happily ever after and love is all about compromise. Barabara's hair gets worse, whereas Robert Redford is just beautiful through out the whole movie. 7/10 I hated the ending.",The Way We Were
59,danjakubik,"Stylish, sentimental, slightly uneven romantic drama, has some good individual scenes",8,13 June 2010,"""The Way We Were"", 1973, showcases the acting and singing talent of Barbara Streisand, who's quite attractive looking in the film. What's most memorable, is the title song and music score, which both won Academy Awards. I felt the film's best feature is, that it convincingly creates a mood of romance and sentiment from beginning to end. Music score, cinematography and film editing are largely responsible for this, unfortunately, not the screenplay.Streisand takes on a role near and dear to her heart, in real life, at the time. She plays a young Jewish woman who is very political and passionate. As an unlikely casting choice at the time, Robert Redford plays her love interest in the film, however his character is somewhat weak minded. Not the usual, male macho role he played at the time. I thought the screenplay was insightful and interesting, but a little uneven, throughout. Sentiment is kept in check. The highlights of the film are Barbra Streisand, the title song, music score, cinematography, art direction and some strong, effective scenes throughout the film. I'm a romantic by nature, so I was somewhat forgiving of the films shortcomings.The story idea concerns two star crossed lovers. Opposites do attract, but the long term success of this kind of romantic relationship, tends to be less than average.Recommended for romantics, sentimentalists and Barbara Streisand fans.",The Way We Were
60,sdave7596,"Opposites attract, but rarely last",8,6 August 2009,"""The Way We Were"" released in 1973, stars two of the biggest names in show biz then and now, Barbra Streisand and Robert Redford. The story is basically a weepy melodrama, but who cares? Both of these superstars are the reason to watch. At first, we cannot imagine what they see in one another. They meet in college, circa 1937 -- Katie (Streisand) is a wallflower political activist, Hubble (Redford) is the Golden Boy track star. Yes, both were too old to play college students, so it is obvious the director surrounded them with people their own age, with some decent supporting actors like Lois Chiles and a younger James Woods. The two are reunited by World War II, Redford is in the military but also part of the uppity ""Beekman Street"" crowd, Streisand is a liberal who is nuts about FDR and working on various political causes. The unlikely twosome fall in love, get married, and do not always have an easy time. Redford doesn't mind his wife's political activity, but he is bored by politics and cannot relate to them. The turbulent 1950's hit, Redford is a writer in ""Red Scare"" Hollywood who takes the easy way out; Streisand believes people should always stand up for their principles, no matter the cost. Sydney Pollack directed this fine film, and had to convince his friend Redford to take on the part of Hubble Gardner; Redford was reluctant, and it is easy to see why. His character, while a decent guy at heart, is also shallow, somewhat superficial, and doesn't take life seriously. The film obviously exploits Redford's golden boy looks, something he always detested. Streisand's part is obviously the more interesting one, as the part was exclusively written for her. And while her character may not fit in on ""Beekman Street,"" she looks fabulous here. All in all, this is one of the finest romances to come out of the 1970's that also has intelligence and class.",The Way We Were

At the same time, the film is flawed. Laurents was displeased with the changes Pollack made to his script, and although it went through many rewrites by various well-known writers, the end result was still largely the creation of Laurents. Laurents was an idealist, who was so consumed with what he saw as the ""Truth"" that he ignored the necessity for audience appeal.

63,montgomerysue,almost 50 years later ....,6,5 February 2021,"My girlfriend in college took me to see this in the fall of 1973. I thought it was pretty good and she loved it. There was a lot of hype over this movie that lasted through the holiday season. Streisand and Redford were at the top of their game and the radio was playing the theme song incessantly. The other day, my wife put this on tv and I sat down to watch it with her. The direction by Sydney Pollack, the cinematography, set decorations, and costumes are still top notch. Really an attractive looking film. But, almost 50 years later, I feel that the performances of the leads just do not stand the test of time. This was no doubt a vanity piece for Streisand at the time, but now her acting just seems a little high-handed and hammy. Redford looks like he's bored with the entire affair. Any chemistry between their two characters just seems sort of forced. I read during the intervening years that many excellent scenes with talented actors Viveca Lindford and Bradford Dillman were edited out of the final release, which is a shame. Their characters were somewhat intriguing. That being said, it is glaringly apparent that Dillman was edited during the famous sailboat scene with Redford towards the end. At one point, Dillman's character laughs, and you don't even know what he's laughing at. Pollack claims that the editing was done to crank up the romance story as opposed to the Hollywood blacklist plot line. But severe editing was done on the great Anne Francis in Streisand's ""Funny Girl"" in order to make sure no one upstaged Streisand.

Just terrible, not even the efforts of Barbara Streisand to make her character minimally believable can make this film watchable. The evolution of the characters throughout the film does not make any kind of sense whatsoever, I guess the writer and director tried to show that personal beliefs and political commintent may be stronger even than love, but I cannot imagine a more clumsy way to depict it. The same characters develop a strange assortment of relationships along time with the background of political and historical issues taking place in the US during the 30's through the 50's, in the end it all results a mess of incongruent situations, unbelievable leaps in the life stories of the characters, absurd scenes of arguments between the two main characters...

I don't think that it's because it hasn't aged well, but that the movie just suffered from a badly done screen play and some bad writing. If the picture had been directed by Barbra Streisand, I might understand why Robert Redford and all of the other actors were like scenery standing around while Ms Streisand emotes. But I don't think more participation from them would have helped. The romance is implausible between such divergent characters. The war time Navy never stationed any of its officers in New York. The line drawn between a raving radical and a selfish wasp is far too wide. What was I thinking thirty years ago?",The Way We Were
72,foxface,trying to become one,8,16 February 2006,"I've seen this movie a couple of times, at different ages, and I have to say, the older I get, the more I enjoy this film. Sometimes you see two people together and think, ""they have nothing in common,"" or ""they are an odd couple."" I feel Katie and Hubbell were attracted to each other, because they each had something the other lacked and wished they had inside of themselves.Katie and Hubbell were able to speak to each other honestly, brutally about the other's flaws. I think they came together to form a complete being, and that is why they married. Yet, this film also informs the audience you can't change your core beliefs, even for the sake of love. Eventually what brings them together, drives them apart.Redford's performance is often criticized in the film for not being emotional enough. If things always come ""easy"" to a person, there really isn't a need to make much noise, when you have access to all of your dreams. Redford's character knows he has deficiencies and that he is taking the easy way out. Hubbell is really a cynic at heart, but a shrewd cynic, because he tells Katie in one scene, that after the witch hunt is over, no one will care who was red or not, because people will just want to work, to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. Hubbell seems to know his time with Katie is limited, he knows they won't work out at tries to break it off, but can't. Hubbell also realizes Katies doesn't want the ""easy"" Hubbell and demands the real Hubbell make himself present in their relationship and in his professional life. At the end of the movie, people mention they don't like Hubbell, because he didn't have contact with his daughter, failed himself personally, but remains a professional success. Maybe Hubbell felt his daughter would be better off without him, or maybe having contact with his daughter meant he would always have to see Katie and he didn't want to be reminded of losing the love of his life. Maybe Hubbell felt constricted by the demands of love, realized this about himself and didn't want to expose a child to his defect. Yet, the final scene saves Hubbell for me, because when he walks across the street to speak with Katie and admits he can't come over for dinner and is pained to know his daughter has a good father. It was like he was never really a part of Katie's life. Hubbell and Katie were a movie about star crossed lovers that ran its course. The look on Redford's face is priceless.So all in all, Redford's understated performance, (with just enough outrage over Katie's antics in key moments) was just the right balance to Striesand's fire breathing Katie. In another actor's hand Hubbell's character would have tried to match fire with fire and that wouldn't have worked. You believe Hubbell has the strength to stand up to Katie and try to love her.As for Streisand, she walked a fine line between being a strong woman and being a fool for love. She knows she is all wrong for Hubbell and that she is stronger than Hubbell, but feels he could be a better person with her, and the right partner for her if, he would make the effort. She is going to mold Hubbell into the person she and he would like to be, but always forgets he is a human being with flaws. On paper, in person, he is too good to be true and is prince charming. The ballroom scene where Hubbell cuts through a crowd of people and dances with Katie is something from a fairy tale. Katie's yearning for someone from a fairy tale is interesting, because deep down she yearns for a knight in shining armor. Though the world around her tells her Hubbell is unobtainable, because he is a WASP, she is Jewish and not a blond bombshell, he seems to come from money, she's working class. Katie hates herself for being attracted to Hubbell, but can't help it. Striesand annoys you at times, but makes you root for her Katie. And why shouldn't she have prince charming? Striesand pulls out all the stops as a woman of passion and intellect, who shows her vulnerability through her love of Hubbell and tries to bring him up to her level in the area of personal responsibility to others and to oneself.Visually, Striesand is stunning in the glamorous 40's outfits and Redford is ready for Hollywood. It was interesting to see Katie transformed into a glamorous, almost carefree person in California, and that was because she was on Hubbell's turf. Back in New York, she goes back to her naturally curly hair, and you know she is back where she belongs, ready to save the world.The end of the movie is heartbreaking and yes, though everyone else has typed about it, you have to the love the hair brushing gesture Katie gives Hubbell and the warm embrace that shows there is still something between them, which was too much for them both to bear. I cry every time.",The Way We Were

This movie did not make me understand just what the attraction was to Redford's character other than his hair. In fact, it was Steisand's hair vs. Redford's! The basic plot was all-American Christian male linking up with cute Jewish communist sympathizer. What could go wrong with that? What they saw in each other was never developed. I never got the impression that there was any real commitment to each other in this movie. Also not developed was Redford's character. He looked like he was just walking through the part. But, going back to Rt. 66, he's the same (flat affect) in just about everything. I guess that's being cool (but contrast that with Steve McQueen's performances). So, what was the point of the movie? When two people fall in love just because of their looks, when they have absolutely nothing in common, their relationship will fail. Well, who would have thought?",The Way We Were
74,RomanceNovelist,Superbly acted...but this was not romance. It was two heartbroken people,8,2 January 2021,"Redford and Streisand acted with such gravity and depth, that the movie is not only breathtaking, but absolutely mesmerizing. I'll give a brief summary then my thoughts. Hubble is a waspy golden boy and Katie is a left wing activist. She works 3 jobs and takes life and the social issues of the era seriously, while the only thing Hubble is serious about is enjoying life and all the perks and privileges that comes with his station in life. They meet in college, and Hubble is intrigued by Katie. She's an enigma. But Katie is just barely polite to the privileged golden boy, and even goes out of her way to avoid him. He convinces her to share a beer one night, where he realizes she sees more in him and his talent than he sees in himself. Later, they even share a dance at a ball where he finally manages to captivate Kate before disappearing into the night for what seems like forever. Fast forward almost a decade. It's the middle of WWII and Hubble is back in New York, dapper, and fully dressed in uniform. Katie is like an infatuated school girl. They see each other at a party, share a cab, and eventually a bed in the span of a night, though Hubble is too drunk to remember that anything has transpired. He is barely interested in her now, and has no intention in maintaining the acquaintance. But Katie makes her feelings and infatuation clear. They soon meet up again and the relationship evolves into dating, a 10 year marriage, a pregnancy, and a painful breakup. Excellent acting by Streisand. One of the most powerful aspects of her performance was that she was able to make the viewer fall in love with Hubble with a single look. She allows the viewer to see Hubble through Katie's eyes, and Katie is desperately in love with him. Redford deftly conveyed Hubble's internal conflict and inner pain throughout the movie, using only the look in his eyes. His Hubble gazed at Katie with such patience, empathy, conflict, and occasional frustration, that it was heartbreaking. This is a very mature movie that doesn't explain or offer any easy answers, we are left to interpret these emotions on our own. My interpretation is that Katie and Hubble, despite the passion between them, were simply not right for each other. Katie pushed a reluctant Hubble into everything she wanted him to do, and so did everyone else, and he liked it that way... he flowed with the current while she moved against it. We learned he wasn't interested in any of the plans they made, including writing another novel or a plan to move to France. Living a lie caused them both a lot of pain. The relationship should have ended the first time they ran into trouble. Hubble wanted out of the relationship early but it was Katie who dragged him right back in, despite his hesitation to do so. Instead of telling her how he felt, Hubble led her on. I loved Redford's performance but I disliked Hubble as a character. He let the relationship go on for too long before he could be honest with himself, and ultimately Katie. Instead, he waited until there was a baby, had an affair, and was willing to leave her before she gave birth but only stayed because she asked him to wait until she had the baby. You have to be absolutely miserable to want out before your child is born. But Katie also brought this on herself. She saw only what she wanted to see and didn't listen or notice that he was incredibly unhappy. She expected him to change for her while refusing to compromise on leaving politics behind to sustain their romance. Hubble was just going through the motions and it pained him too much to hurt Katie by leaving her, until it hurt him too much and pained him too much to stay. He cared about Katie, but he was not in love with her the same way she loved him. Though I'm inclined to say, that Katie loved her empty politics more than she loved Hubble. Neither fit into the other's world and it took too long for either of them to figure this out. Beautiful movie, superbly acted, but I'm not shy about calling their romance a mistake. It wasn't meant to be.",The Way We Were
75,AdemWeldon,What a pathetic relationship.,6,6 April 2004,"(some spoilers)Sydney Pollack's The Way We Were is a disjointed romance that leaves the audience with mixed feelings. As with some of his other romance films (Out of Africa and Havana), there is never a sense of absolute love. All of these stories incorporate a mixture of rapidly progressive narratives, but then the intent of each film is focused on the romance between Robert Redford and the appropriate leading lady. Pollack is victimized by trying to capture every possible emotion of a serious relationship. His devotion to the realistic parallels between his characters and real people is (at times) incoherent due to over-exposure. Pollack always shows the highs and lows of each affair. In The Way We Were, the happier' times of Katie and Hubbell are mainly captured with montages. It is easier to appreciate the validity of their love if they are seen joyfully running on the beach or sailing in the fresh ocean breeze. Pollack then chooses to exploit the struggles they each have with one another. We are constantly brought back to the question of which person has the correct' views and beliefs. Katie eventually subdues her political ambitions to be with Hubbell. Later they both realize that she cannot lie to herself, (although this revelation is influenced by Hubble's philandering), and they end the romance. Though their problem seems evident, Pollack tries a great deal to show that there are more serious undertones that burden the couple. At times religious distinctions are subtlety employed, and even the possibility that Katie considers herself brighter' than Hubbell (which he resents by domesticating her). Sadly, the film's secondary flaw can be found in the disenchanting HUAAC sequences. Katie's crusade is never fully actualized because of poor editing. The black listing of the 1950's was a very serious time for the film industry and this film did not do the impact justice. Arthur Laurents decided to incorporate the event as a part of the romance, but the beginning college sequences seemingly foreshadow Katie's would-be-triumph. Instead, Pollack shreds the last bits of integrity by using the event only as a vehicle to justify the breakup. Perhaps a more interesting climax might have followed if Katie and Hubbell's demise were set against the backdrop of a secondary culmination that should have been Katie's actualized triumph.
A bleak, rainy day. Far from Pollack's best.** (of ****)",The Way We Were
76,Lramrz24,A Big Disappointment,3,20 April 2000,"It seems a shame to even say it, but I can't say I didn't find The Way We Were to be a huge disappointment of a movie.  I mean here I am ready to watch one of the greatest love stories ever told on film, and no more than an hour into it, I find myself wishing it would end already.  Boring Boring Boring is the only way I can describe it.  Perhaps it has something to do with todays generation being desensitized to issues like divorce and break-ups since they happen all around us, but I didn't feel in the least bit moved by Barbara and Roberts break-up!  And while were on the subject of Robert, can somebody please explain to me why he is supposed to be such a hunk???  Though I did find Barbara to be at her most physically appealing, I once again have to dimiss Robert as someone of slightly less than mediocre looks.  What's the big deal.  Overall, I found nothing appealling about the movie and suggest to those who have not seen it not to bother, unless tiresome dialogue and nonexisting storyline appeal to you.

77,StoryLover10,Had to be there,5,23 February 2021,"""What's going on?"" I asked. She was a good big sister and gave me the history lesson after we got home from the theater.I was 13-14 or so. Streisand and Redford were hot tix items at the time. I knew then it was a sappy love story with some socio political backstories that seemed disjointed, but important for context to my pubescent brain. Sis connected those contextual dots.A half century later, I do not hold The Way We Were to the standards of today yet comparing is unavoidable. Revisiting this film this evening confirmed that it was exactly what we could, and did, expect for its time. The politics and McCarthy hearings were grossly underdeveloped and some choppy editing caused pronounced continuity issues in several scenes. Streisand was borderline nauseating in her lovesick melodramatic portrayal, but that was a large part what audiences expected in the 1970s. To be fair, more substantive acting and direction would not likely have been well received in 1973-apt metaphor for Hubbell's film writing and watered-down scripts during the blacklist era. Conversely, Redford was better than I remembered, what a talent. The script was clearly edited to bits, which in this revisiting, I find sad. This film could have been so much better were it made today.According to Ben Mankowitz, Trumbo and Coppola had a hand in some of the writing, but word is that many substantive contributions were cut out, likely the cause of some of those awkward cinematic moments. Trumbo, of course, likely would have imparted meaty social commentary, beyond the Katie character's relentless social conscience. I also remembered the ending as being abrupt with much too much compacted into a few lines about the couple's time apart and future life trajectories. This viewing did not change that perception-another missed opportunity for a better developed story arc. Memory often imprints reaction rather than specifics. Such was the case with The Way We Were.

80,michellehayworth,A love story that stands the test of time!,10,22 March 2002,"The story is set just before, during and after the Second World War, a time of unparalleled American political radicalism. Streisand plays Katie Morosky, a university student and vocal leader of the Young Communists. She is drawn to the strikingly handsome, athletic and intelligent Hubbell Gardner (Redford), whose glibness and All American good looks anger and attract Katie, while also masking his apparently fine writing talents. One must say 'apparently', as we are never given any indications of what makes him such a fine writer. In fact, we are given little indication of what makes him a worthy object of the much more interesting, active and intelligent Katie's desire. If her attraction is simply to his Hellenic beauty, this seriously undercuts the great romance the filmmakers have attempted to construct.The story is an insightful examination of the conflicting political ideas of its two leads, matching Katie the red against Hubbell the conventionalist, their exchanges explode with tension. The blandness of Hubbell's ideas leaves one with sympathy for Katie, as he looks dull she looks vibrant and exudes fire and verve. Further, against Redford's mannered performance, Streisand looks in command, her face reflecting the inner turmoil she is feeling. It's not hard to fathom why their coupling is considered one of film's great pairings. They look as natural together as Gable and Lombard.
Lastly, kudos to the ubiquitous Academy Award-winning theme. Layered over every scene of even the slightest emotional importance, this has to be one of the most gorgeous themes in film's history. Lovers and romantics, be forewarned.",The Way We Were

82,asoapboxopera,Hubbell is no Telescope,1,31 January 2016,"Hubbell Gardner in The Way We Were is an abominable man. He has no passion, and tries to stifle that in Katie-- from the beginning, when he references her love of knowledge and politics as ""You never stop, do you?"". Hubbell Gardner is an awful, awful man. All the while she's propping him up, and singing his praises, he's openly treating her coldly. She treated him far too well: from the beginning, remember how he was heading out the door to leave her apartment, and couldn't get out fast enough? He was cold and uncaring, and she sought him out with care anyway.He has no backbone, as when he willingly lets his book be mangled into a film-- the act to which she fully objects, thinking he deserves better. Instead, he tries to silence her again, and then weakly let his film be mangled. Hubbell wants Katie to stop challenging him to do better for himself, to want nothing more for him that he actually can work towards. She has more faith in him than he does, but he wants her quiet so he can take the easy way out. Multiple times, he tries to silence her- he frequently tells her to be quiet, and he actually puts his hand over her mouth at the party (granted, she's supposed to be Harpo- on a side note, how is putting on thick eyebrows enough for some of the guests to pretend they're in any swing of things as far as Marx brothers costumes go? It's as bad and dull as the jokes Hubbell's friends make- commentary forthcoming). He wanted her to accept his friends' horrible, dull environs and crass in the horrible, tasteless, unfunny way of humor, and was upset when she didn't want to partake of it. The only mistake Katie made was in thinking Hubbell was worth her time or efforts. She put her own life on hold to go with him to Hollywood to make his dull film. But while she was there, she still managed to make an impact, heading to Washington, D.C., to protest the House Un-American Activities Committee's blacklist. Thankfully at that point he didn't try to silence her, and actually came to her defense briefly to punch a guy who insulted her. Aside from that momentary gleam, Hubbell has no potential. And even then, he followed it with their core differences- he has no hope for the future, and doesn't mind the melancholy, drab, mediocrity he dwells in, whereas she seeks better and tries to implement it.Hubbell simply doesn't care for Katie, or for himself. He is perfectly content to live his vapid and pointless life, and doesn't mind hurting Katie along the way. Even his friend, J.J., who made those tasteless jokes, told Hubbell Katie was ""really somebody"" and somebody you ""don't want to lose"". Hubbell of course doesn't get it, and cheats on her with the very person J.J. considered no one special. Plus, Hubbell knows Katie is pregnant at the time.She finally ends it with him, and her giving birth is as sad as it should be happy- the baby is fine, but the relationship that could be- the potential she hoped for in him- is all gone.When they meet later, he is still incredulous at her ambition, or his inability to put a damper on it. Despite his attempts to make her dull, or lose hope, or become boring like him, Katie is still seeking change and a better future. He has no concept of trying, when he is so emphatic about stagnation and giving up. After she's left him standing with his new lady, she is done with him, and goes back across the street to protest the bomb. As she's focused on her demonstration, he follows her, crossing the street, just to say, ""You never give up, do you?""When they were in college, Hubbell wrote a story feigning ambition, to have things not be easy- but it was all words. Sadly, even that story's recognition in their short story writing class led to real action by Katie, to stop pursuing her own writing, and tear up her work. She buys him a typewriter. He doesn't get one for himself- she gives him the tool. Still, as Hubbell, it was all a farce. Like the lies of the short story, Hubbell puts up a front, writing 8 chapters of a second novel, which later does not come to fruition. Katie asks if he ever intended to publish it: ""No."" If he ever wanted to move to France: ""No."" The closest thing Hubbell ever comes to ambition is his proximity to Katie. And even then, he tries to corrupt her into stagnating and giving up, and giving in to society, as he does.She thinks his writing style is absolutely gorgeous. This is a clear reference to her fondness for him, and his own attractiveness. Let this be a lesson to all-- no matter how pretty the words, or the man, it is the action that counts. Without action, there is nothing, and Hubbell has no idea about action, whereas Katie is action, and drive, and spirit, and motivation. Hubbell is stagnation embodied. He is attractive enough, has the ""right"" friends, the ""right"" place in society. He has and is nothing. Especially compared to Katie. Without action, there is no potential.So unlike the Hubble telescope is he. He has no perspective, no forward-thinking, and no ambition whatsoever. Katie tried to see in him, but there isn't anything to see.In no way is this a ""romance for the ages"", but in every way is it a delightful, cautionary tale against giving your life and soul to someone who doesn't deserve it.",The Way We Were

No dates are given, and it's impossible to date it by the clothes (by which one would say it all happens 1973) or any other details. So... this is supposedly a ""great love story"", and several times it is pointed out how Katie ""never gives up"":Hubbell: ""You never give up, do you?""
Katie: ""Only when I'm absolutely forced to.""Yet they marriage didn't last 3 years. We really don't know when they got married, but they met again 1945 and started their relationship there, and she got pregnant 1947, and they got divorced when the baby was born. 
She basically hated everything about him, his friends, things he found interesting, what he wanted with his life. She claimed to be supportive, but all she wanted to support him to do was what SHE wanted him to do. The only thing she compromised was to move to Hollywood with him, but she claimed to be ready to give up everything just to have him in her life... and he said she didn't need to. After all, he fell in love with Katie from College. He loved her. And she continued with everything she thought was important, even protested against the McCarthy crap. 
But she... she was like a starstruck bitch who just wanted to have everything her way and whined when she didn't get it. I really dislike her. And a romantic movie when you dislike the heroine? Not good. She had it all and was a spoiled bitch so she threw it all away. It wasn't even that she lost it, she threw it away. He loved her as she was, but she didn't love him as he was, and he didn't change fast enough.The ""touching"" end scene... nothing touching about that.

I suppose it has filmographic good sides, I mean, the music is amazing, the filming is nice... acting is good, I suppose... costuming is crap, editing is crap, script is... well. I suppose it's not that bad, because it is believable, but I hate her and it's not a love story, so... Frankly, the only reason to see this movie is for Robert Redford and he has done dozens of better movies. Just see ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""The Sting"".",The Way We Were
84,tony-ritchie-965-605112,Star Quality Makes this movie good but not grat,7,26 March 2018,I re-watched the Way We Were last night and came away with these thoughts. It is visually a very well made movie and Redford and Streisand are both very good and have great on screen chemistry. It is at the end of the day a good love story. However the story is very uneven. I felt the second half of the movie was not nearly as good as the first. Some of the motivations for Katie and Hubell didn't always make sense and seem to be over done. Hubell no really wanting to see his baby or have anything to do with it at the end painted him to be a little bit of a jerk which is not the best way to end it.,The Way We Were
85,reasonformirrors,Streisand is Amazing,7,2 July 2008,"We all remember the Paula Abdul song, ""Opposites Attract"", from her debut album, 'Forever Your Girl' (Yes, you are, Paula). Well, if you don't remember the song, you surely remember the music video.The music video begins with a spotlight guiding our eyes towards a poster that reads, ""MC Skat Kat and Posse"". Seconds later, MC Skat Kat begins the song by proudly proclaiming:I'm MC Kat on the rap, so mic it Here's a little story and you're sure to like it Swift and sly and I'm playing it cool With my homegirl, Paula AbdulAbdul then spends the next three and a half minutes flirting, dancing, and having some good old-fashioned fun with the animated cat.Is there really much truth to the phrase ""opposites attract"", or is it just a cliché that people use to try to justify idiotic people making irrational choices for shallow reasons? Hubbell Gardiner's(Redford) short-story begins with the line ""Like his country, things had come too easily to him"". Katie Morosky(Streisand) later on tells Gardiner that the line in the story is true of his own life. Maybe that's it. Maybe opposites attract because people want a challenge, and to get the guy/girl who they shouldn't be with on paper, is what attracts a man/woman to his/her opposite. Who would want, or need, a challenge more than someone like Hubbell Gardiner: All-American, popular, handsome college-athlete for whom things always came too easily.Hubbell's attraction to Katie (Jewish, ultra left-wing, political activist) can be rationalized, but what about Katie's attraction to Hubbell? Maybe Hubbell is right when he says's to Katie, ""When you love someone, from Roosevelt to me, you go deaf, dumb and blind."" Maybe we shouldn't even bother to try to rationalize an emotion like love. See, the ""opposites attract"" idea is not strong enough to make me believe that MC Skat Kat would ever have a chance with Paula Abdul, and it's not strong enough to make me believe that these two characters, on paper, would even get into a conversation with each other, let alone have such a passionate romance.The romance, on paper and at moments in the film, seems a little forced. However, it does work. It's not a naively romantic movie. It's definitely realistic, and it does not use the ""opposites attract"" idea as a tool to turn the concept of love into a force stronger than it is, as if it can conquer every and anything. In fact, the movie shows how their differences, despite their undeniable love for each other, are what drive them apart and prevent from being with each other. The movie should be titled ""The Way We Were, Are, and Will Always Be"" because they are ultimately static characters. The two leads also have a significant amount of chemistry truly needed for this story to work.Streisand's performance, especially, is what makes this movie work. Streisand has always played the down-to-earth, very human, very warm, funny young girl, and we all love her for it. This role was a challenge because the character of Katie Morosky is such a strong, stubborn, idealist (which can be very admirable, up to a point) and only Streisand's charisma can keep the audience from not being as tortured by her personality as Redford's character is throughout the story.The main problem with the film is that the plot seems to just be a way to past the time until the two break-up.The plot goes one way then inexplicably abandons that path without any sort of resolution. The Hollywood Ten protests were used as a way to get these two to suddenly fall out of love. The pregnancy plot point amounted to nothing more than the film ending, pointlessly, with Hubbell being an unapologetic deadbeat dad and nothing being or implied about it.This is one of Streisand's best performances and she really makes this film. Even with its flaws, it's intellectually engaging enough to enjoy.",The Way We Were
86,bm317,"wowed at twelve, but 30 year later...",6,17 February 2005,"I saw this movie growing up, and had the impression it was so terrific, and absolutely heartbreaking. Saw it a few days ago, 30 years later, and ... wasn't as impressed. The acting of Streisand made this movie good. Along with the music (still a tear jerker to me). And the theme of the difficulties inherent in an inarticulately relationship is worthy. But wow, I'm stunned by the reliance on stereotype of unattractive, needy Jewish girl and attractive, talented gentile boy. I myself as an adult couldn't figure out what Katie saw in Hubbell, if she was really the politically intense, principled character she was suppose to be. (Though the chemistry between Streisand and Redford is palpable. Maybe this was also why the movie was such a big hit.) I didn't think Hubbell was inherently a cardboard character, script-wise, as Redford feared. Hubbell had a slime side -- cheating, abandoning his daughter, emotionally unavailable to his partner, arrogant. (All qualities now judged from cultural perspective of early 2000s.) But in movie, these characteristics just seemed to be reasons Katie couldn't hold onto her guy. Perhaps it was Redford who flattened the potential for the character's complexity, giving the character a seemingly monotone ""integrity,"" even after behaving in ways that utterly lacked in integrity. I also caught some problems with the script this time around. For instance, I thought it was hilarious (unbelievable) that Hubbell wouldn't know the name of Katie's mother even after they were married and Katie was pregnant. And by the way, what was the catalyst for their last breakup? I realize now I didn't miss anything -- it is missing.",The Way We Were
87,mcpatti,A beautiful movie with a Beautiful Babs and Bob!,8,18 August 2018,"This film is definitely a classic. I had never noticed before how Redford is able to convey his story through silence. His silences, looks and acting carry forth his storyline. There is much icing to this cake. with Ms Streisand's singing, the outgoing character of Katie but what truly brings it home is Redford's ability to convey the character's truth through silence. I love them both, (actors and characters.) and it all comes together in a magical way. How very lucky we are to have them both in our lifetimes such great artists! Their chemistry is the cake and foundation to this lovely and unique film.",The Way We Were

But, it's one of those movies you can watch over and over.No one could have played Hubbell better than Robert Redford. I just can't see Ryan O'Neal as Hubbell. Redford is so quiet and mysterious. Just so darn sexy, even after all these years. At 36, I think that he is one of the sexiest men alive.I always heard rumors that they were going to do a sequel. I guess it will never happen. I don't think they would be do old...They are both still attractive and could do another love story. There aren't enough people who remember this movie that would go see it now.It's a shame they cut some scenes out, I wish they had put them on the DVD.See this movie, especially if you want a good cry.",The Way We Were
89,eldiran-24234,Misunderstood Politics as Love Story,8,28 May 2018,"Although this film works tremendously as a love story (or rather, anti-love story, for they break up to stay authentic to their perspectives), the larger point of the film is to trace the evolution of American Thought,--'The Way WE Were'-- from a time before Total Commercialism took over. Streisand here is the Idealist who fights for the Rights of others, and Redford is the happy-go-lucky privileged guy who simply (though regrettably) wants to live an uncomplicated life of sacrifice--two different options that battled in America from the late '20's on. Here the two Ideals are attracted to each other, and though they share an admiration, are not complementary. (A point much better made if you include the tragically cut deleted scenes--see YouTube) Great Star power by the 2 leads, and some really thoughtful dialogue (especially restaurant fight scene) that raise this film far above simply 'a love story'.",The Way We Were
90,cmaltezos,One of Hollywood's Best Love Stories,10,24 June 2007,"This is a classic love story. Streisand and Redford have terrific chemistry and make a great couple. Yeah, they're mismatched, but that's the brilliance of this film. How many times have we met someone we love that's bit different from us and then we try every way we know to make it work, yet in the end we realize we just can't change who we are. It's tragic and beautiful at the same time. I love the way Streisand and Redford really discover each other on screen. Little moments here and there such as when she drinks a toast to his book and he notices her shoes are untied and assists her in tying her shoes. I'm a Streisand fan and love her take on Katie. She never quits or gives up. There is passion, pain, strength and determination to Katie and Streisand hits all the right notes in this film from the beautiful title song to the heartbreaking ending. A treasure of a film!!!!",The Way We Were
91,sthomas659,history lesson / romance,10,22 January 2006,"This film combines the paranoia of the house of Un-Americans during the the early 1950s and a budding romance. It integrates a romance and reveals how two people can have different viewpoints and SOMETIMES those can dismantle a romance while INFLAMING it at the same time. The directing is excellent. Repetition is used in this film well. Katie brushing Huble's hair gently off his brow. It is especially important today to INFORM and DEMONSTRATE to young people the kind of outrage that went on during the 1950s Hollywood and the witch hunts. Many faces you will see that are familiar in this movie including Lois Chiles and James Woods. The music score is wonderful and there is a feeling you leave with perhaps a ""what if"" or ""chances gone by."" For Streisand fans it is a ""not to be missed film."" She is at her most elegant and strong willed. A strange combination but she pulls it off. Redford is young and handsome and plays Gentile very well. Anyone who had ""the one that got away"" may relate to this film. Great flick.",The Way We Were

Streisand and Redford are just wonderful as the film follows their stormy but passionate relationship through the years. Redford is gorgeous as Hubbel Gardner. He is meant for this role of the campus king but the story is smart enough that he is flawed. Streisand gives a GREAT performance a Katie Morosky. She is the opposite of Redfords golden charms. It's not until the second half that we see her character in full bloom. She is tortured by her love for Hubbel and her strong political convictions. Streisand plays this passion so real you feel it's a documentary of this character. The pairing of Streisand and Redford is brilliant. They look gorgeous together and Streisand's sexual heat for him is scorching! This kind of movie could not and would not be made today. It is so special and beautiful with no desire to be anything but a tragic love story. It ended up being a GIANT hit!! Icing on the cake for this classic!",The Way We Were

Nothing I've seen (I haven't seen a lot, but still) has compared to the chemistry, the depth of feeling, and the realistic portrayal of two opposites both beautiful in their own right.  This movie is a testament to the way we were really, how it was beautiful to be decadent and disgusting in the thriving 50's, of the attractive ""waspishness"" of Ivy leaguers, of politics and war.  The movie is not dated either, its quality making it appealing to a whole spectrum of people who would normally not be interested in something this good.  I first saw this movie in a history class and to my surprise most of the people in the class loved it, people who would normally go see ""Titanic"" and rave about it for days.  I think that is, if not something else, at least evidence of this movie's depth, quality, feeling, (and although very sentimental) realism.

100,barrie_creamer,art and craft - its got the lot,8,18 June 2005,"The Way We Were Barbra Streisand is your one-dimensional actress. One look at her face and you know what she's going to do  fail. She's always on the outside looking in, incredibly needy and her own worst enemy; scuppering any relationship before she can be rejected  maybe there's a hint of the autobiographical in what she does? However, man can she sing! Now before anyone tries to 'out' me for this  take a look at the bigger picture here. Streisand invariably plays Streisand  that's smart  she knows her limitations and so doesn't attempt anything too grandiose. The rest of the film is just as well-balanced.Robert Redford is also fairly one-dimensional as an actor. However, his dimension is the fifth  on a plane occupied by Steve McQueen, James Dean and other such deceased luminaries  if only he had the good taste to die he would be legend. His skill is on playing to his limitations and attributes also.Sydney Pollack directs  Sydney Pollack IS a legend (Tootsie, The Fabulous Baker Boys)  all great films can be attributed to the quality of the directing. This is a truism. No actor can carry a turkey but a great director can stuff one, baste it and slow-cook it to perfection.As well as being a totally seductive love story (one of the few a man can watch and not run the risk of having to sacrifice his cajones), The Way We Were is that rarest of things in Hollywood, an historical document. It manages to sneak under the radar by telling Hollywood's story in the era of McCarthyism and the 'House Un-American Activities Committee' as Redford's college athlete golden boy discovers not only is he handsome, skillful, stylish and cool but he's also a fairly decent writer who ends up re-writing his own screenplays which are perceived as being 'commie' (It doesn't help that his missus (Babs) is an outspoken Marxist with high fallutin' notions about the first amendment (freedom of speech)).Their relationship is rocky from day one. She becomes obsessed with him the moment she first spies him; he finds her curious and inspiring and her belief in his ability and the importance of his writing whilst slightly maniacal drives him to produce great works. Were it not for her, it is likely he would have stayed in the army or taken a sinecure somewhere and drank himself to oblivion whilst still looking fabulous  Gatsby style! She seems to drift on his coat-tails whilst forever railing against his decadent friends and lifestyle and whatever cause of the day takes her rage on its inexorable wave and they eventually split and rekindle and split again but not before hammering out the finer points of why 'it..justwontwork'  this is beautifully done. They know they are doomed. He is too perfect. Everything comes easy to him. She is too unsatisfied, mostly with herself. Nothing is good enough for him in her eyes and everything too good for her  she feels out of place.The scriptwriters; and this is rare, write the rise AND demise of a love story rather than just the development and crescendo of one. They see it out in all of its explosive fury and passionate hopelessness. The characters are believable. It's a thing of beauty to look at too  seventies films have that special something which has subsequently been lost  the film stock permits the audience a certain viscera and tangibility and the sets, costumes, acting, directing, soundtrack and cinematography are simply gorgeous  there's a real craftsmanship to the film. From the flawlessness of every scene, the stills of which could easily be sold as art, to the attention to detail in capturing the era  no expense is spared  no detail overlooked and the music! One can only be moved by that bloody song.This is the backdrop created for the actors who can only but perform up-to-par and they do. They must have been conscious of the amount of face close-ups where their expressions were paramount or the long drawn out shots where they ARE the scene  or maybe not  maybe Sydney Pollack made the most of what they were doing and not the opposite  who knows? In either case you are transported through art  the effect is like theatre, which in recent times film-makers have forgotten, bent as they are in cramming in as many scenes, explosions, effects, bright lights and noises as possible and labelling it high-octane action (with the notable exception of some of the new generation, Spike Jonze, Todd Solondz et al).I want a film that moves me, not causes me to have to move for fear of developing photo-sensitive epilepsy or going deaf in one ear  where is the craft in that? Where is the art? Always remember, film, at its very core is art.This film is as close to film-art perfection as you will find.Enjoy!",The Way We Were
101,samrosecorkie,a great movie for those of us who will never forget the person we loved and lost.,10,18 December 2004,"Once in a while you see a movie which makes you think about it long after its over The Way We Were was just such a movie which is perhaps why people of all ages can relate to it. Katie (Streisand) is the nice Jewish Girl who neither drinks or smokes and whose passion is politics. She is bright as a new penny and has an opinion about everything. Hubbell (Redford) is a handsome shallow Waspy guy for whom everything comes easy. Unlike Katie who has to work hard for everything she achieves. She has a crush on him in college in the late 30's but the romance doesn't begin until she runs into him in a nightclub during World War 2. She instinctively understands that the differences between them cannot be surmounted. However, he is another cause to her and she is determined to bed him. Which she does while he is too drunk to know that it even happened. I have never seen a scene like this before or since in any movie.As the relationship continues it becomes obvious that it is because she wills it to work. I think he is fascinated that in his world where people lack passion and are vaguely bored that here is this fierce woman pursuing him. (The book was written by Arthur Laurents who met just such a woman during his college years.) Hubbell is amused at his power to intrigue Katie and basks in the glow of her powerful attraction. When I first saw this movie I kept thinking Katie you won the prize now just keep your mouth shut and enjoy it. But as I get older I believe that she was the one who would ultimately end up the winner because she wanted so much. At one point he says to her ""Katie give up already"". So you have to wonder if he would have stayed married to her if she had not said enough.True to his passivity even at the end of the movie he leaves her to raise their child which he has no desire to see. Whether its because he can't bear to see Katie now married to David X. Cohen or whether it is that now that Katie is not interested in him he will not take responsibility for his child--one is left to wonder. He will never find someone who loves him the way Katie does and there is that sad recognition on his face in the last scene.There has been talk over the years of a sequel. I have always wondered what Hubbell would have been like in 30 years time. Things would no long come easily to him as he gets older. Katie would be very disappointed had she stayed.",The Way We Were

Not only that, the soundtrack is fabulous and ""The Way We Were"" sung of course, by Streisand, is both haunting and beautiful.The Way We Were is not only a cinematic masterpiece, but probably one of the most honest films ever created about love. Katie and Hubbel are so in love, yet so different and unwilling to change their own values and priorities, it just won't work. This is honest. People don't want to change and people do prioritize objects and causes ahead of people. Few movies capture this side of life, which is why The Way We Were will be around for many years as a great love story.",The Way We Were
