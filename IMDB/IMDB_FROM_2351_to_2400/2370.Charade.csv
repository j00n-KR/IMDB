0,MartinHafer,A nice blending of light romance and suspense,8,9 September 2006,"While I do not think this movie is good enough to make the IMDb top 250, it still is an excellent movie that is a lot of fun. I think some of the reason it is rated highly is because there seems to be an ""Audrey Hepburn cult""---a devoted group of people who see her as the greatest actress that ever lived and her movies as masterpieces. While I would admit she was a heck of an actress, I just don't think BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, ROMAN HOLIDAY or CHARADE are great--just very good and entertaining.The film automatically is guaranteed to be very good just because of its pairing of Hepburn and Cary Grant. Both are such professional and likable actors that it's no surprise at all that the movie succeeds. And while Cary is significantly older than his co-star, this is handled pretty well in the movie. The older Cary isn't as sure of himself or tough as he once was and he even makes a few remarks about his advancing age. This is a very graceful way of making the pairing actually work. About the only aspect of the pairing I didn't care for was how many times Cary turned out to be someone else. Considering how often he lied to Audrey, it didn't make much sense for her STILL to fall in love with him. This does prevent the movie from scoring a higher rating from me, but it is a relatively small quibble since the rest of the film works so well.The supporting cast is exceptional--particularly George Kennedy as the hot-head. The writing decent and direction superb. In particular, the exceptional camera-work result and music resulted in a wonderful romantic mood and the director worked with his crew to ensure this. Also I was impressed by the scenes where the two would-be lovers were on the barge having a romantic dinner. I noticed that they actually worked with the sound to make it sound as if the barge was actually going under the bridges--with Grant's and Hepburn's voices echoing realistically to this. That's an excellent touch that many directors would NOT have included. It was obvious that this was a work of love.So fans of the two stars as well as fans of romance should enjoy this film very much. About the only ones who might not like CHARADE are action-loving teens and kids who might just think the whole thing is ""icky"" and can't understand why Ms. Hepburn would fall for ""that old guy""--if only they knew and understood!",Charade
1,TheLittleSongbird,Classy and entertaining comedy thriller that deserves a lot more respect,9,23 February 2010,"I was one of those people who was convinced this was a Hitchcock movie when I first saw ""Charade"". I think this is because the idea of the plot, some of the set pieces and the style of direction are remarkably similar. The director here is Stanley Donan(co-director with Gene Kelly of ""Singin' In The Rain""), and I thought he did a great job directing.The real stars of this classy, entertaining and I think underrated Hitchcockian-like comedy thriller are the clever plot(with an ingenious McGuffin) and the marvellous romantic score from Henry Mancini. The cinematography is skillful enough and the Parisian locations are ravishing. Not to mention some truly wonderful set pieces such as Grant taking a shower fully clothed, Grant and Hepburn falling in love on a river boat, a hair-raising cliffhanger on the roof, the priceless funeral scene and the sequence under the stage.The acting is marvellous, with charming, brooding and urbane Cary Grant and lovely and equally charming Audrey Hepburn making a dream pairing and making the most of a crisp, funny and sophisticated script. James Coburn makes a star-making turn, Ned Glass is deliciously obnoxious and Walter Matthau, a wonderful comic actor in his time, in an understated performance here that I personally think is the strongest one of the film. In fact, while I have nothing against George Kennedy, I did feel as though he was slightly phoning in his performance here, but considering how good this film is that is a minor criticism.Overall, this film is terrific, not the best movie ever made but a long way from the worst. It is such a shame people have to be so derogatory to not only this film in general, but also about Grant, Hepburn and other movie stars like James Stewart when they have a lot more talent than most of the actors working today and that is a fact. Not trying to sound opinionated, but I'd rather watch any Hitchcock or this than any of the Friedberg-Seltzer spoofs or Steven Seagal's most sloppily paced, lazily acted film. 9.5/10 for ""Charade"".

2,bkoganbing,A Truthful Whitefoot Or A Lying Blackfoot,8,16 January 2007,"Audrey Hepburn's husband who only married her months earlier is seen being thrown off a train in his pajamas. Turns out she didn't know a whole lot about him, mainly the fact that he had stolen a lot of money from the OSS during World War II and double-crossed his partners in the heist. Now they and the government are looking for the money from her.All that's been left to her as far as her husband's things are the contents of a Lufthansa travel bag and the rather mundane contents of said bag. It's all one big Charade for Audrey, she doesn't know who to believe. She'd like to believe Cary Grant and who wouldn't, but every time she turns around Grant's got a different character name. He has a total of four during the film. The others are James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, and Walter Matthau.Charade boasts a fast moving plot and great location photography in both Paris and the Swiss Alps. It also has a nice musical score with a title song that was up for an Oscar that year. If the song Charade had won it would have been an unprecedented three wins in a row for the songwriting team of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. But the song lost to Call Me Irresponsible from Papa's Delicate Condition.It's ironic that Cary Grant at the last minute backed out of doing Sabrina because he thought the contrast in age between him and Audrey Hepburn would not be believed by the audience. Maybe so, but they do make a nice couple here and apparently he changed his mind along the way.We should be glad he did.",Charade
3,Leofwine_draca,The best film Hitchcock never made?,7,21 March 2014,"The similarities with Hitchcock's movies are too numerous to mention, other than to comment that CHARADE may well be the best Hitchcock film that he never actually made (that honour goes to Hepburn mainstay Stanley Donen). This is a witty and affectionate comedy/romance/mystery featuring impeccable performances from Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn as two people thrown into a mystery involving a hidden fortune and some deadly foes.CHARADE has a lot going for it, not least the crisp, neat, early '60s style. Grant is at his charismatic best, even though it's clear he's past his prime here, while Hepburn plays the usual intelligent, glamorous and slightly fragile character that she's so adept at. Film fans will be in their element with the presence of numerous soon-to-be-famous actors, including George Kennedy, James Coburn, and Walter Matthau.The story twists and turns at a merry place, ably mixing romance with murder and coming off well as a result. I particularly liked Grant's murky character motivations and how you're left constantly wrong-footed as to his character's true intentions. There's little to dislike here.",Charade
4,SnoopyStyle,Uneasy Mix Suspense and Comedy,7,3 November 2013,"Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) wants to divorce her husband but he dies before that happened. He sold everything they owned and the cash $250k is missing. Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) befriends her and he seems to be helping her. Hamilton Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) from the CIA reveal her husband has a secret past. The problem is that everybody is after the money, and she can't trust anybody.Audrey Hepburn plays a bit too dumb. CIO? Sure she puts on those big sunglasses and have great fun playing spy. It's an uneasy mix of suspense and comedy. The thriller part is a cross between Hitchcock and James Bond. It's a compliment. It's a fun action thriller. I wish Hepburn and Grant weren't so cool. It has the effect of lowering the temperature of the dangerous action.",Charade
5,Hitchcoc,Twists and Turns galore,9,8 December 2016,"This is a great whodunnit, using two of our most charismatic actors ever: Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Audrey has money that is hers due to the death of her husband. Once word gets out that she is loaded and is planning on giving the money to the government, three shady characters get into the act, pursuing her. There is a wonderful sense of humor to this film (much like the comic relief in the Hitchcock thrillers--usually delivered by the likes of Stewart or Grant himself). There is a masterful web of intrigue here and clever dialogue galore. Hepburn is beautiful, of course, and the photogenic Grant works his magic. Who are we looking for? Where does the danger lie? That's the question.",Charade
6,Prismark10,Keep up with the act,8,1 February 2014,"Often regarded as the best Hitchcock film not made by Hitchcock. This is a thriller with suspense, intrigue, comedy and a dash of romance.Audrey Hepburn is Reggie Lambert on the verge of divorcing her husband and finds out he has been killed.Reggie returns to Paris and find out that she is being pursued by people who are after her husband's loot. She is aided by Cary Grant who may or may not be a good guy. He keeps changing identity and there are enough twists and turns that will keep a citizen of small Parisian back alley in a frenzy.It is the cast that makes this film special. Apart from Hepburn and Grant, we have future Oscar winners in the shape of James Coburn, George Kennedy and Walter Matthau.Maybe some of the Paris backdrops looks a bit dated now but this is one hell of a fun thriller.",Charade
7,mark.waltz,To Paris with Spies...,8,22 March 2017,"A captivating and outrageously funny spy spoof, this is one of the great romantic comedies of all time. While Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are about 30 years apart, this gives a new twist to ""Bringing Up Baby"", Grant's comedy classic with the other Hepburn. Grant got to work with practically every younger actress of his day, often having more chemistry with them than the young actors of the time did with actors the same age. Hepburn herself had her share of older leading men, and Grant is perhaps the best for her as she was perhaps the best for him. She's a recent widow, shocked to find out that the husband she was about to divorce was a thief, allegedly having stolen a huge amount of cash from the C.I.A. Now an agent of theirs (Walter Matthau) wants the money back, warning Hepburn that dangers involving two stalkers (James Coburn and George Kennedy) are out to get her to get their hands on the money as well. The charade going on keeps making Hepburn doubt Grant's honesty, even after he risks his life for her. Grant, charming as ever, takes a shower fully dressed, fights with hook armed Kennedy on a rooftop, and even parodies himself in ""To Catch a Thief"". His attempts to grab an orange from the double chinned neck of a society matron is hysterical. Hepburn, as lovely as she was in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", is a stylish and elegant comic, but not afraid of taking the brunt of a pratfall or spoofing her princess like image. They are just perfect together, with Matthau, Coburn, a creepy looking Kennedy and ""West Side Story's"" Ned Glass in excellent support. In an ironic reference to ""My Fair Lady"", Cary Grant responds to Audrey's inquiry of where they are with ""On the Street Where You Live"". She also mentions Gene Kelly dancing by the river in ""An American in Paris"" and several other iconic Parisian cultural references as well, a touch obviously of director Stanley Donen's, a major factor in many of the great 1950's MGM movie musicals. In fact, the elegant touch of MGM and the stylish look of Hitchcock's recent hits is very evident. You'll not soon forget the Henry Mancini theme, either.",Charade
8,claudio_carvalho,"A Movie That Presents Action, Romance, Comedy and Mystery in Right Doses, With a Very Charming Central Pair of Stars",8,3 December 2003,"Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn, charming and elegant as usual) is spending vacation in some skiing station, when she meets Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) for the first time. They have some ironic conversation in a table of a bar. She has the intention of getting the divorce from her husband Charles when she comes back to Paris. When she arrives home, she finds her apartment totally empty and that Charles was murdered, dropped from a train. She goes to the morgue, to recognize the body, and she receives his assets in a small wallet. Later, she receives a call from Carson Dial (Walter Matthau), from the American Embassy. They meet each other and he informs her that Charles was a CIA agent, and he had stolen in 1944, during the WWII, the amount of US$ 250,000.00 with four other agents. He also advises that these men will chase her, trying to recover the money. Then, Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), the freak Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) and Leopold Gideon (Ned Glass), Charles' former partners, threatens her. Regina meets Peter again and he protects her, until she gets suspicious of him. Regina in the end does not know who is trustful or not. Yesterday I had lunch with a couple of colleagues and one of them told me that `Charade' is one of his favorite movies. I decided to check it out and I do not regret: it is indeed a movie that presents action, romance, comedy and mystery in right doses. All of that, supported by the wonderful Audrey Hepburn (in my opinion, one of the most beautiful smiles in the history of the cinema) and an older, but still handsome, Cary Grant. The ironical and sometimes acid dialogs are great. Some parts of the screenplay seem to pay homage to Alfred Hitchcock, with a delightful mystery. There are many shifts in the plot until the last scene. The quality of image of the VHS available in Brazil is not good. A magnificent entertainment, indicated for the whole family. My vote is eight.",Charade
9,classicsoncall,"""I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer!""",8,15 April 2018,"This is probably the only movie you'll find with stars of the caliber of Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn who begin the story by getting hit in the face with a squirt gun! I'd have to say they took it pretty well in stride to create an entertaining comedy/mystery that more than a few viewers on this board compared to an Alfred Hitchcock thriller. My thoughts were in agreement as the film started out as well, the train sequence was a regular Hitchcock motif.What was distracting to me though was the age disparity between the fifty nine year old Grant at the time, romantically paired with Hepburn who was thirty two. This wasn't uncommon for the era, but it comes across as rather unrealistic today. Grant's shower scene with his suit on would have played much better with a younger actor, and probably more credible. But in relation to the main story, I think they more than pulled it off with Grant's constant change of identity right up until the surprise reveal at the American embassy. What the picture did more than anything for me was to wish that we had gotten a look at the 'real' Charles Voss. He must have been quite the character if all three of his funeral attendees felt it necessary to test the integrity of the corpse. Reading some of the other reviews for this picture, and even though I enjoyed it quite well myself, I would have to agree that there's a somewhat dated quality to the writing, most notably at the finale with Regina Lampert's (Hepburn) gushing over the idea of a marriage license. That's something that was all too typical Fifties and Sixties that wouldn't pass muster with today's audiences.",Charade
10,gavin6942,Strangely Forgotten Spy Film,8,31 August 2012,"Romance and suspense in Paris, as a woman (Audrey Hepburn) is pursued by several men who want a fortune her murdered husband had stolen. Who can she trust? I was not aware of this spy film, and it confuses me why not. Audrey Hepburn has one of her better roles here, and Cary Grant may have given his last great one. Walter Matthau is incredible, and it is all directed by Stanley Donen, who is probably better known for his musicals. This should be a huge hit, but I had never heard of it.Apparently the movie is in the public domain because of a copyright goof. I know nothing about that. But it is a tragedy if true. Those responsible for this deserve every ounce of credit. Luckily for audiences, the people at Criterion snatched this one up and saved it. All too often public domain films languish and die. Criterion gave it the star treatment.",Charade
11,lee_eisenberg,Not only can you expect the unexpected...YOU SHOULD,10,11 July 2005,"Probably the best part about ""Charade"" is that you can't figure out until the very end who is on which side. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is a Givenchy-clad UN translator whose husband has been murdered. In Paris, trying to find out who or what was behind the murder, she discovers that there was a part of her husband's past with which she was not familiar, relating to a group of men who want something. Among the men are Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) and Cary Grant's character, a suave stranger who frequently changes his name. And H. Bartholomew (Walter Matthau) is even more intriguing still.One might compare ""Charade"" to another Cary Grant movie: ""To Catch a Thief"". Both movies are set-in-France mysteries in which Grant stars opposite a glamorous woman born in 1929. But I notice something else about ""Charade"": a series of patterns relating to the number 7. Bear with me.The word ""charade"" has seven letters. It was released in 1963, and 63 is 7 times 9. Cary Grant died in 1986, Audrey Hepburn in 1993, and Walter Matthau in 2000, all at seven year intervals. Interestingly enough, James Coburn died in 2002, so he broke the seven-year pattern (he also broke a pattern in the movie: he was the first character not wearing his pajamas when...well, I won't spoil it for you).Okay, I admit that that's probably all just a coincidence. More than anything, one can observe how hot Audrey Hepburn is. No matter what the camera angle is, this movie brought her to what may have been her most glamorous role. Sweet!",Charade
12,jboothmillard,Charade,8,4 October 2006,"From director Stanley Donen (Singin' in the Rain, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Funny Face), I remember seeing this classic caper once or twice, and remembering it being fantastic, so I watched once again to get a definite opinion on it. Basically Regina 'Reggie' Lampert (BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Audrey Hepburn) is due to divorce her husband Charles, but returns from a skiing holiday in Switzerland to Paris where he has been found murdered, thrown from a train, and he apparently left her $250,000 in gold, which has gone missing, she is now trying to find where it is. She meets Peter Joshua (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Cary Grant), well, this is the first name he gives her, he changes his name every fifteen minutes or so, but not so much his back story that there is a Mrs. ?, but they are divorced, anyway, he too is interested in her husband's fortune, which was stolen from the U.S. government during World War II. The husband's former partners in crime: Tex Panthollow (James Coburn), Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) and Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass), are staying close to Reggie as well as they are sure she may be hiding the whereabouts of the gold, Peter says that he will help her getaway from them, but in fact he is apparently in cahoots with them to get the money. Reggie and Peter are staying together and following all the clues that would lead to where the money is hidden, but one by one the other searchers are turning up dead, and it is only a matter of time before the killer catches up to them in this charade. CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholemew (Walter Matthau) from the U.S. Embassy is the only one Reggie can trust besides Peter, and although he continues to change his name, from Peter Joshua to Alexander 'Alex' Dyle, to Adam Canfield, and not telling her everything she perhaps wants to know, she cannot help but find herself falling for him, and vice versa. Eventually it is discovered that the fortune is not gold or money at all, the fortune all rests on the value of a bunch of postage stamps, but Peter and Bartholemew have Reggie cornered, and she unsure whether to believe her love interest or the supposed government officer, in the end she goes with her heart, Peter reveals himself to be an investigator in the case of the missing fortune all along, and he assures her she will know his real name on their marriage certificate, Reggie is happy, they will marry once Peter gets the stamps back. Also starring Jacques Marin as Inspector Edouard Grandpierre, Dominique Minot as Sylvie Gaudet and Thomas Chelimsky as Jean-Louis Gaudet. Grant as usual is charming and cool, Hepburn is glamorous and cast well as the woman in the middle, the pairing of them is perfect, supporting cast members Matthau, Coburn and Kennedy all add well to the mix as well, the ravishing Paris locations work well for the story as the search for a hidden fortune goes on, the romantic and tense music by Henry Mancini is great, there are the lovely couple sequences, the exciting action sequences, and there are good moments to laugh at, it all adds up to a satisfying romantic comedy thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Charade"". Audrey Hepburn was number 13, and Cary Grant number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Grant was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Grant was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors, Hepburn was number 3 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Hepburn was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Women, Grant was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 23 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Charade
13,ccthemovieman-1,Still Going Strong Past 50!,10,28 October 2005,"I have found many films just aren't as good as I remember seeing as a kid. A wide-eyed youngster gaping at a big silver screen at the theater can be more memorable than a middle-aged guy seeing that film decades later on a small television.However, here is one film that is EVEN BETTER than I remembered it. Yeah, it's a little dated here and there, but not much, just mainly Audrey Hepburn's dialog. However, the story with all its twists is just as suspenseful and fun to watch as it was over 50 years ago. I've seen this three times in the last two years, after that long, long absence. (Tip: spend the extra money to get the Criterion DVD disc. It is the only clear, sharp copy of this film I have seen.)The story's strength lies in getting the viewer involved. One never knows whether Gary Grant is a good guy or a bad guy. The dialog between Grant and Hepburn is very entertaining as the latter tries to figure out the same thing. There are lots of good lines, particularly by Grant. That in itself makes this film fun to watch multiple times. The pacing of this story also is good; the film moves fast and spaces the action out smartly.This has to be one of the best movies ever to come out of the 1960s. I have never known anyone who didn't like this film.",Charade
14,rmax304823,"Comedy, Thrills, Romance.....",6,22 July 2011,"Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn were well matched, an ex acrobat and an ex ballerina. Ten years earlier they were both among the most beautiful people in the world. Grant's dimple and Hepburn's eyes could have sold a movie all by themselves. Gawd, she was stunning, a la gamin. Alas, features harden or sometimes soften with age and the end result, even if only barely noticeable, is a little depressing. A couple of jokes point up the difference in age between the two but it doesn't help much. Time's winged chariot. Shudder.Their performances, though, are as fine as ever. Grant had nearly perfect comic timing and Hepburn looked born to be shocked. Stanley Donen's direction is efficient and Henry Mancini's musical score is appropriately mysterious and romantic at the same time. The supporting players do exactly as much as needs to be done -- Walter Matthau (in the dubious role of mustachioed villain), the angular James Coburn, the bulky George Kennedy, and the treacherous mouse, Ned Glass.It's a bit weak, compared to other romantic comedies of the same period -- Blake Edwards' ""The Pink Panther,"" for instance. The chief problem is with the screenplay, which thinks its funnier than it is. The amusement seems forced at times, too much given over to lengthy scenes in which Grant takes a shower in his drip-dry suit while Hepburn laughs herself silly, or to scenes in which the couple try to transport an orange from under one neck to under another without using their hands.""Do you want to see where I was tattooed?"" ""Yes."" ""Good, we'll drive around there sometime."" You can hear joints creaking as the guffaws are reached for.I saw this when it was released and found it charming. The charm has faded with the years but it's still a diverting example of its genre.",Charade
15,Tweekums,"A thriller that is tense, amusing and romantic",9,4 February 2012,"When Mrs Regina Lampert returns to her home in Paris planning to ask her husband for a divorce she is in for a surprise; the apartment is bare and the police inform her that he has been murdered! At the funeral three strangers turn up; take a look at the body then leave; it soon becomes apparent that her husband was not the man she thought he was. She is contacted by one Hamilton Bartholomew of the CIA who tells her that her husband and the three other men were responsible for the theft of a quarter of a million dollars worth of gold, which was intended for the French resistance during the war. It looks as if her husband had tried to steal it from his co-conspirators and now they believe she must have it... except she has no idea where it could be. Shortly afterwards a man she met on holiday turns up at her apartment and offers to help her... although it soon becomes apparent that he knows the three men from the funeral and they are all after the money. In what follows suspicions about where the money is and who has it constantly change as the crooks distrust each other while trying to get Regina to tell them what she knows. Tension rises as one by one those looking for the money end up dead leaving Regina convinced she is in danger from the man she thought she could trust.This film may be almost fifty years old but it is still fresh due to a fine story and a great cast. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are perfectly cast in the central roles of Regina and the man she knows as Peter Joshua; there is a real chemistry between them. They are ably supported by a well known cast that includes Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy. For a film with such a light touch and plenty of humour it is surprisingly tense; in particular the scene where 'Peter' fights the claw-handed Herman Scobie (George Kennedy) on the roof of a tall Parisian building and the final scenes where Regina fleas through the Paris Metro leading to a final confrontation with the killer. There are plenty of twists through out the film as characters switch from good to bad and sometimes back again... there is even a twist in the post confrontation epilogue!

17,moonspinner55,"Audrey fingers Cary's dimpled chin and asks, ""How do you shave in there?""",9,29 April 2001,"Just one of the many marvelous moments in ""Charade"", one of Cary Grant's and Audrey Hepburn's best films. There's a quarter of a million dollars floating around instant-widow Hepburn but nobody can SEE IT (it's right in front of their eyes). Filled with running jokes, colorful and eccentric oddities (such as trenchcoat-wearing George Kennedy with his hook and the little guy who won't stop sneezing), funny set-pieces (like the funeral scene, and Audrey's priceless exaggerated reactions) and suspenseful sequences, not to mention Audrey and Cary looking smashing together. This is one of 50 best films ever made, as good as ""Casablanca"" and ""My Fair Lady"". In fact, I think it's better.",Charade
18,Quinoa1984,"a fluffy, adorable movie about men dying and vying for money",8,12 May 2015,"It's often called in that cliché term the ""Best Hitchcock Movie He Didn't Make"". It's understandable of course - the mistaken identities, the spies (sorry, ""agents""), and Cary Grant, plus a foreign locale in particular with France and Paris (and To Catch a Thief, which this has a somewhat similar flavor to most of all, had two of those things for sure). But it's really in the shallowest terms that it can be described like that, even as I'm sure it would make a fine second film on a double bill with North by Northwest or Notorious. Something about the film is a little too... light, yes, even in comparison with Hitchcock. Not that it's a bad thing, far from it, but Charade is its own Hollywood escapist animal.The director here is Stanley Donen, who's Singin' in the Rain is maybe the greatest movie musical Hollywood produced. He brings together these stars, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, along with supporting players like Walter Matthau (for me a bit underused, though when you see the movie you'll know why), James Coburn and George Kennedy, and takes Peter Stone's comic script and gives it polish and flair. It's also filled with an air of romance - of course, if it's from Hollywood in the 50's or 60's and it has Grant and/or Hepburn, you're bound to usually find romance, and why not, they're beautiful people to look at and even more attractive when they're having to play irony or cute-sarcasm in their dialogs.The plot is fairly frivolous, and in the third act (though only then really) there's a kind of MacGuffin, but it all links back to money. I have a feeling Stone set up this plot, and knew it was good, but even compared to Hitchcock the stakes seem kind of low. When the fellow past-WW2-thieves get together to try and hash out where the quarter of a million are, though there are snarls and comically timed sneezes and Kennedy's got that hook for a hand, nothing is too menacing, and the threat level is actually quite low, and Donen's direction, though solid, doesn't have that calibrated, sometimes experimental side that Hitch had in spades. At least, I should say, it was for me. Perhaps I've just seen too many of these films (including, I should also note, Jonathan Demme's 2002 remake, The Trouble with Charlie, which I hadn't seen since then but suddenly seemed as fresh as it was when I first saw it, but I digress).For those going into it as a casual movie-goer, maybe seeing just a thriller or a comic escapade here and there, Charade will seem fresh as all heck. One thing that I can give it, aside from the obvious and light (but wonderful) chemistry and playfulness of the stars, is the element of the twists. People's identities keep coming into question - most of all for Grant's character - and it was actually something that remained clever throughout. We can guess that one isn't who he's saying who one is or the other, and it's all thanks to Hepburn, her character and her performance. She's the star, but she's also the audience (at least for the time), trying to piece together things and having to take trust at face value. Of course, who doesn't want to trust Cary Grant? The man at one point takes a shower with his full suit on just to amuse the pretty lady by his side. Again, adorable stuff.If it is kind of a frivolous movie, it's at least presented with gusto, a mostly cracker-jack music score (only one scene, with a fight on a roof-top at night, seemed kind of weakly composed), and the supporting players give as much a boost as do the stars. It's the kind of movie that would be good for a first date, if you have the date that likes movies from Hollywood's 'classic' age before those darn hippies took over. It's elegant, it's flashy, it takes its audience on a ride and we're glad to go on it. The only thing it doesn't do is leave an incredible, lasting impression, which is why it's still Hitchcock-lite ultimately.",Charade
19,JohnHowardReid,Treat yourself to a great movie experience!,10,15 December 2017,"It is really unusual to find an excellent, big-budget movie like ""Charade"" (1963) in the $2 DVD bin. Put it down to the fact that copyright was not renewed when it expired in 1991. Thus the movie is now available worldwide on at least thirteen different labels. Even when compressed, the DVD quality still rates at around 8/10 on most labels. And at least three of them feature excellent transfers that will cost you no more than two dollars.An exciting blend of mystery and romance, with a few comic touches thrown in, this Parisian-set, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant vehicle comes to a really suspenseful climax on the Metro and in a deserted theater. Stanley Donen's direction of this ""Charade"" is always right on the ball, and if George Kennedy's villain doesn't frighten you out of your lethargy, you may need to take a refresher course in movie menace.",Charade

I read on Wikipedia that this was the ""best Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made"" and I can't help but agree with that assessment. I mean, with stars like Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, one can't help but see how perfect they are in this mashup of thriller/comedy/romance that Hitch so perfectly did in his heyday especially whenever Grant keeps us on our toes when guessing which side he's on. Director Stanley Donen must have either seen many of Hitch's movies in preparing or he simply had the right instinct of what to do when filming. Also loved Henry Mancini's score and the Maurice Binder credits but I really loved seeing some of the other supporting cast like that of James Coburn and George Kennedy, both of whom provided just the right amount of menace for their parts. One other player I haven't mentioned yet that I loved was also just right for his part: Walter Matthau as someone Ms. Hepburn has to trust to get pertinent info from in order to move the plot along and who also provided a twist that I managed to predict but I didn't mind that I did since it also provided such an exciting climax. Add to that the perfect ending and I'll just say that I wouldn't mind seeing Charade again some day when I'm in the mood for such a pleasurable mix of genres like this one here...",Charade

Every time he seems to earn the trust of Ms.Hepburn, she receives further news that he is never the person he says he is. The ending will really grab you.Interesting, that I just read that the little boy who portrayed Jean-Louis, never made another film again and is now a professor of urology.Hepburn still has that persona of vulnerability on the screen as a woman who really didn't know her husband. When he winds up suddenly dead, she immediately turns to Grant who has suddenly come into her life. When the ""gang"" goes after her for the loot, go know that Grant is mixed up with them, but in reality he isn't.

22,hitchcockthelegend,Quality seeping from every genre pore.,9,9 September 2010,"Charade is directed by Stanley Donen, written by Peter Stone and Marc Behm, and stars Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. It also features Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Dominique Minot, Ned Glass, and Jacques Marin. It's shot on location in Paris with Charles Lang on cinematography and Henry Mancini provides the score - where his memorable theme tune was Oscar nominated.When her husband is murdered, just prior to seeking a divorce from him, Regina Lampert (Hepburn) finds herself pursued by a number of men who seem to think she knows the location of a quarter of a million dollars in stolen loot. Of all the men who are now thrust into her life, it's the handsome Peter Joshua (Grant) who she trusts and sides with. Trouble is, is that his name keeps changing and she's finding it difficult to determine who exactly are the good guys and who are the bad guys - especially as the corpses start to mount up.Pure Hollywood entertainment featuring two of its most endearing and classy performers, Charade shows how a multi genre spliced film should be made. It's rare to find a film that works on all levels, as a comedy, a thriller and a romance. But thanks to the astute direction from Donen, Charade comes up trumps whilst also oozing an elegant sheen about it. That Grant & Hepburn have charisma in abundance is something of a given, but they are given a quality script to work from and a Hitchcockian plot to revel in. It has been said from some critical quarters that there is no peril in Charade, thus its reputation is not entirely lived up to. Yes we can say it's a playful movie, but it's meant to be, pretty much like ""North By Northwest"" is. Yet the peril exists, lest we forget a great rooftop fight and the last quarter of the movie as we follow our hurried protagonists through the Parisian underground - and on to a memorable encounter at a theatre. Or what about a metal handed George Kennedy putting the pressure on, or James Coburn menacingly playing with matches? No peril my eye!.There's also been the odd dissenting voice proclaiming the structure of the story to be confused. Well it's very twisty, delightfully so, but nothing to tax the brain. Everything is laid out in simple terms and all dialogue is spoken nice and crisply. All played out amongst the splendid back drop of Paris. This was the first and only time that Hepburn & Grant appeared together. A crying shame, for in spite of Grant worrying about the age gap before hand (Grant 59/Hepburn 34), to the extent he requested some dialogue changes to make Regina the romantic pursuer, their chemistry sparkles and they make a very believable coupling. Coburn, Kennedy & Glass are effective bad boys, while Matthau is a key presence throughout. Stylish, charming, suave and suspenseful, with an ending that's truly a pleasant surprise - both in revelation and character closure, Charade is not to be missed by anyone who likes a bit of comedy, romance and thrills in their respective movie diets. 9/10",Charade
23,jotix100,Parisian adventure,8,5 November 2005,"Stanley Donen, the director of ""Charade"", was a man better known for his contribution to the musical genre. In a way, he was a natural for directing this marvelous movie of adventure and romance based in Paris, a city well known to the director. In fact, it didn't come as a surprise this is one of his best movies Mr. Donen ever directed. In fact, ""Charade"" has all the right elements to work as it does. First it's a thriller adventure as the beautiful Reggie is being menaced by some unsavory characters and she has no clue why are they doing that to her. Her dead husband ties her in to all the bad guys that want to get hold of a treasure she possesses, but has no idea about what could it be. When Peter enters the picture, Reggie feels protected, but then there is a doubt planted in her that makes her think twice about his intentions. In the meanwhile, Reggie has to put up with those bad guys shadowing her. ""Charade"" is so appealing because of the immense talented Audrey Hepburn, who was perfect for the role of Reggie. This young woman who works as a translator is one of the best things Ms. Hepburn did on the screen. The actress was a good comedienne as well as an elegant figure that graced whatever she played. Dressed by Givenchy, Audrey Hepburn is a beautiful excuse to look at. Cary Grant is seen as the man who ultimately conquers Reggie. In spite of the age difference, Mr. Grant was always a welcome addition to any film. The easy chemistry between the two stars is one of the strong points of the film. Cary Grant is perfectly suave in the film. The supporting cast was excellent. Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, among others, were perfect.""Charade"" offers a melodious musical score and gives the film a dimension and adds to the action. The great cinematography by Charles Lang takes in the beauty of Paris at its best. This is one of those films in which Paris seems to add to the general enjoyment one feels in watching it. ""Charade"" is an excellent film no matter how many times one watches it thanks to the inspired direction of Stanley Donen and the gorgeous Audrey Hepburn who is irresistible in it.",Charade

She has no idea what is going on until she finds out her husband had a large amount of money she knew nothing about--and three evil men (Ned Glass, James Coburn and George Kennedy) want it and are convinced she has it. Suave Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) is on hand to help her...isn't he? Just great combo murder mystery, romance and comedy beautifully shot in Paris. The script is wonderful--always moving and full of twists and turns. Hepburn and Grant are in top form effortlessly throwing off highly charged sexual innuendos at each other. However I DID find it hard to believe that Hepburn fell in love with Grant. He's a great actor and very handsome but come on! He could be her father! It has some extreme (for its time) violence but it's VERY tame by todays standards. It carefully walks the line between mystery, humor and romance and never looses its footing. There's also a very funny funeral sequence at the beginning. This is a Hitchcock like film--hard to believe he didn't make this.The acting is very good by Hepburn and Grant and Coburn is fun. But Kennedy and Glass are just so-so and Walter Matthau is horrible. Still the focus is mostly on Hepburn and Grant so these are minor complaints.This was a hit upon release. Unfortunately the TV version is heavily edited (for example--the movie runs 114 minutes and played in 2 hour time slots on TV!). That might be why the movie is still pretty unknown even today.

Composer Henry Mancini received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Music Score. The cast is first-class with George Kennedy, James Coburn, Ned Glass, and Walter Matthau playing the villains who will do whatever it takes to find the loot. ""Charade"" has enough twists and turns to keep you interested throughout its 113 minute running time. The scene where Grant has to remove an orange from a stout woman's body in a French restaurant without using his hands is amusing.The story really begins in World War II when the villains were U.S. Army agents working with the Office of Strategic Services. This quintet was ordered to deliver $200-thousand dollars to the French Resistance. The resistance never got the money The action opens as a body of Charles Lampert is hurled from a train careening through Europe. The authorities find Lampert's pajama-clad corpse lying next to the tracks of the Paris-Bordeaux railroad line. According to the dates, the police reported Lampert's death on May 4, 1963. Meantime, the murdered man's wife, Regina (Audrey Hepburn) is planning to divorce Charles because she doesn't love him. She feels that Charles has been keeping something from her. When she returns to Paris, Regina finds their apartment barren and a police inspector, Inspector Edouard Grandpierre (Jacques Marin of ""Shaft in Africa""), waiting for her. Later, in his office, Inspector Grandpierre points out that Charles had bought a ticket for a ship sailing in the morning for Venezuela. Naturally, Regina is confused. She tells Grandpierre that Charles was a Swiss citizen. He tells the policeman that Charles had no profession. Not only does stashed his money. An exasperated Grandpierre wants to know what happened to the quarter of a million dollars that Charles received from the public auction where he sold the contents of their apartment. The only thing found that belonged to Lampert was a blue Lufthansa traveling bag with his passport, an unsealed letter, a wallet with four thousand francs, an agenda with the last notation written on a Thursday, a ticket to South America, a comb, toothbrush, and a container of tooth powder, etc. Now, Regina is truly mystified by all this information.Later, she runs into a mystery man who she met initially at the ski resort and afterward at her apartment. Regina tells this individual that she plans to get her job back at EURESCO where she works as a simultaneous translator like her friend Sylvie. Unlike Sylvie who translated English into French, Regina translates French into English. She was working as a translator before she met and married Charles. Since she cannot remain at the apartment, Regina allows her mystery man to help her find an affordable hotel. The scene that ensues is pretty strange. Essentially, the villains make their entrance at the funeral. Aside from Sylvie and Regina, the only person attending the funeral is Grandpierre. The inspector sits quietly and clips his fingernails. The first of the villains to enter is Leopold W. Gideon (Ned Glass of ""Blindfold""); he sneezes on Charles' corpse. The next is Tex Panthollow (James Coburn of ""Our Man Flint"") and he checks Charles' corpse with a mirror to be sure that he is dead. After Tex comes Herman Scobie (George Kennedy of ""Cool Hand Luke"") who has a mechanical contraption in place of his right hand; he sticks pin into the corpse to check it.

Bartholomew tells Regina that Charles stole $250-thousand from the U.S. Government. He suspects that she has the money, but she claims that she doesn't. Nevertheless, Bartholomew urges her to find the money because she is in a great deal of danger. Things really get sticky after this interview.""Mirage"" scenarist Peter Stone relies on misinformation to distract audiences from solving the mystery as well as the whereabouts of stolen fortune. Although the dialogue is often neat, it isn't quotable. Hepburn gets ample opportunities to scream, be harassed, and feel betrayed, while Grant epitomizes suave sophistication in a suit and tie. Charles Lang's photography is excellent and the camera work in the morgue is imaginative. Hepburn looks gorgeous in a variety of outfits. James Coburn menaces Hepburn in a telephone booth at one point by striking matches and throwing them at her. ""Charade"" qualifies as an exciting but literate woman-in-jeopardy thriller.",Charade

29,oscaralbert,Sometimes screenwriters throw in a twist or six too many . . .,7,5 January 2015,". . . and CHARADE is a case in point. Taken as anything but a comic farce, the Byzantine plot Unspooling here is bound to tangle all your brain neurons into knots. Audrey Hepburn plays a slight variation of her ""Holly Golightly"" character from BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S. She embodies Mrs. Charles (Regina\Reggie) Lampert as an impulsive professional woman, willing to marry any guy who asks, if she at least knows his name. Cary Grant slings up ""Peter Joshua,"" ""Alexander Dyle,"" ""Adam Canfield,"" and ""Brian Crookshank"" on her wall, figuring he'll eventually get one to stick. As he says he's from crime-ridden Detroit, this makes sense. Everyone in the Motor City from the Georgia Peach to Slim Shady has at least one alias. But a plot that involves a large sum of money whimsically transforming from Nazi gold to furniture and lingerie to expired postage stamps seems more suitable for an episode of BEWITCHED than a spy thriller feature flick. I think that I like the parlor game Charades better than this film incarnation. The acting in the game usually is more believable than what's seen here, and the game's plot is less muddled.",Charade

Cary Grant is as good as he usually is at this period of the sixties (only okay) and Audrey Hepburn, who many love and I struggle with as much as she does her parts. Here she about half Grant's age and is presumably asked to play it like a silly schoolgirl. Meanwhile she is asked to display all this haute couture stuff and whoever thought it was a good idea to display clothes on that body must be having a laugh. Sad and cringe making at times there are just enough moments, especially those with Walter Matthau to keep this going until the delirious last section. Why, oh why couldn't we have had more of this? Instead of a motley collection of gents in hotel rooms we could have been out in the sunny streets of Paris. There is colour, there is suspense, there is even romance as we race and chase in full on colour, including a scene at the stamp fair and a fantastic sequence down in the glistening metro passage ways and on the trains. A glorious ending to a very average film.",Charade
32,JamesHitchcock,Excellent when seen as a romantic comedy; lacking when seen as a thriller,7,10 September 2004,"Regina Lampert, an American woman living in Paris, returns home from a skiing trip to find that her estranged husband Charles, whom she was about to divorce, has been murdered and her flat stripped bare. Regina is contacted by an official from the American Embassy who informs her that there was much about Charles that she did not know. He was not, as she thought, Swiss, but American (although he was in possession of several forged passports). During the Second World War he served with an American army unit that was responsible for the theft of $250,000. Charles was murdered by his former comrades-in-arms whom he was attempting to cheat of their share of the loot. Regina learns that she too may be in danger from these men, who believe that Charles has entrusted the missing money to her. During her skiing trip, Regina befriended a businessman named Peter Joshua. Joshua turns up again in Paris, and offers to help her search for the money. The plot then becomes very complex, and Regina begins to doubt whether Joshua is who he says he is or whether she can trust him.Like another film from 1963, Mark Robson's 'The Prize', 'Charade' owes an obvious debt to the work of Alfred Hitchcock- not the dark, sinister Hitchcock of 'Psycho' or 'Vertigo' but the lighter Hitchcock who could blend suspense with humour in films such as 'North by Northwest' and 'To Catch a Thief' (both of which also starred Cary Grant). The atmosphere of 'Charade' is surprisingly light-hearted for a film which has as its themes murder and robbery. This impression of light-heartedness is achieved in several ways. There is the casting of the two leading roles, Audrey Hepburn as Regina and Cary Grant as Joshua. The film-makers of the fifties and early sixties seemed to love casting Hepburn alongside leading men who were not only older than her but old enough to be her father. This did not always succeed (I have never regarded either the casting of Henry Fonda in 'War and Peace' or that of Fred Astaire in 'Funny Face' as inspired decisions), but sometimes the chemistry worked, as with Humphrey Bogart in 'Sabrina' or here with Grant. Despite her doubts about his trustworthiness, Regina finds herself falling in love with Joshua, and there is plenty of playful, bantering flirtatiousness between them, helped by a witty script. Hepburn is as captivating as she always was, and Grant, despite some greying hair, is surprisingly handsome and youthful for a man only a few months short of his sixtieth birthday. Besides the verbal humour, the film also makes good use of visual humour, starting with the opening scene where Regina seems to be menaced by a gunman before we discover that it is only a child with a water-pistol. There are also some attractive, if conventionally touristic, shots of Parisian scenes. ('The Prize' makes equally effective use of shots of Stockholm).Although there are many good things about this film, I was rather surprised to see it so high up in your list of top films. (In my view it is far from being Audrey Hepburn's best film, but it is the one that your voters seem to esteem most highly; indeed, of her others only 'Roman Holiday' makes the top 250). 'Charade' may be influenced by Hitchcock, but it falls some way short of genuine Hitchcock, at least when he was at his best. Even in films that have lighter moments, Hitch was always able to conjure up a genuine sense of fear and danger. Stanley Donen never quite succeeded in doing this; there is, for example, no equivalent of the famous scene with the crop-dusting plane in 'North by Northwest' or even of the car on the bridge in 'The Prize'. The scene with the water-pistol is about as close as Donen gets to genuine tension. Seen as a light romantic comedy 'Charade' is excellent; seen as a thriller it seems to lack a dimension when compared to truly first-rate thrillers. 7/10",Charade
33,lasttimeisaw,CHARADE is a top-notch star-vehicle ingeniously incorporates laughter onto the usual whodunit template,8,27 January 2016,"After the waning of Hollywood musicals, Stanley Donen, the king of the Hollywood musicals, steers into comedy genre and convenes two of the most popular and bankable movie stars in the business, Hepburn and Grant, concocts another exceedingly entertaining masterpiece, CHARADE, penned by Peter Stone, blithely blends a Hitchcock-ian thriller with a rom-com with banters galore, and the result is superbly satisfactory, if one compares it with a later analogue, the Goldie Hawn- Chevy Chase vehicle FOUL PLAY (1978) made by Colin Higgins, one can effortlessly taste the difference in quality, how the storyline of the latter is dumbed down to a no-brainer and the characterisation of its female protagonist as a dim-witted blond is plain prosaic.CHARADE is a nonpareil of the hybridisation of comedy-thriller-romance, Regina (Hepburn) is a newly widowed American in Paris, the mysterious murder of her husband Charlie brings danger to her too, since it concerns a fortune stolen by Charlie and his cohorts during WWII, yet she doesn't have a clue about its whereabout, soon, a knight errant appears, an American compatriot named Peter Joshua (Grant), voluntarily offers her his protection, but whose real identity will only reveal in the film's coda, a minor spoiler, he has four identities altogether. Grant was approaching sixty when the film was making while Hepburn was in her early thirties, the May-December romance seems incongruent at first, but Hepburn had already mastered a wondrous rapport with Gary Cooper in Billy Wilder's LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON (1957) with a 28- year age difference, also it is a stale manoeuvre in the industry to pair senior matinée idols with red-hot and much younger female stars. Thus, Stone's script leans heavily on Regina's proactive move, to contrast Peter's more self-effacing and suave appearance. Hepburn has what we call the essentials of a screen idol, she can enchant audience with her innate geniality and sublime elegance, and leave them forget how far-fetched or ridiculous sometimes the narrative turns out to be. Grant can do the same trick in his prime, but here, his downplayed joviality and less outspoken nature suit the role very well, the most droll moment comes when he takes a shower with his drip- dried suit on, although it is amazing to see him still acquire agility in all the chasing and jumping sequences.Matthau plays the CIA administrator Hamilton Bartholomew, who summons Regina in insisting that the missing fortune should be given back to USA, and holds the key of the big twist, which is not that out-of-the-blue, due to the movie's rather small cast, there would not be enough red-herrings in the killing game. James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass are three cohorts discharging menace and distrust invariably in their one-note design, and Jacques Marin's inept French gendarme brings the ultimate deadpan humour.The film is snubbed by the Academy despite being a lucrative box-office hit, only Henry Mancini's alluring theme song is blessed with an Oscar nomination, and CHARADE is a top-notch star-vehicle ingeniously incorporates laughter onto the usual whodunit template, which very few of today's mainstream products can remotely match.",Charade
34,sddavis63,Enjoyable And Humourous Murder Mystery That Does Run Out Of Steam A Bit,6,16 August 2018,"You certainly can't complain about the cast. Headed by two very big names (Carey Grant as Peter Joshua, etc. and Audrey Hepburn as Regina Lampert) and supported by folks like Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy, you expect fine performances all round, and basically you get that. ""Charade"" is a mix of suspense and comedy. Regina's husband is found murdered as the movie starts, and it turns out that he has $250000 stashed somewhere, stolen with some accomplices during World War II. Those accomplices now want their money and they assume Regina has it. And the story goes from there, the question being : who has the money?The mystery slowly (very slowly - in a good way) reveals itself, and along the way there's a good dose of humour mixed in (Grant taking a shower while wearing his ""drip dry"" suit; the passing the orange game; the funeral scene.) While the mystery around who has the money is the hinge around which the film turns, it's the humour that I found most appealing in this - and that probably makes me rate this down a little bit. Most of the truly humourous scenes take place in the first half or so. After that, it becomes much more dramatic and suspenseful, and this movie just doesn't work as well in that genre. The humour really needed to be a little more evenly spread out in my opinion. The budding relationship between Regina and Peter was at times very sweet, but Grant being 25 years older than Hepburn also had the potential to make it a bit uncomfortable. That was overcome (perhaps deliberately) by having the relationship sweetly romantic, but also a hesitant and even protective relationship, and in fairness I thought Grant and Hepburn worked together very well. The final revelation of who was actually who didn't come as a huge surprise, but that was probably because the story had set us up to expect pretty much anything.In all honesty, though, this did run out of steam after a while. Enough had happened by that time, though, that there was no way I was going to stop watching to find out where the money was and who really wanted it, mind you. (6/10)",Charade

Not quite in the league of ""North By Northwest"", but still a very entertaining and recommendable picture.    (***)",Charade
38,theowinthrop,A Wonderful Suspense Film - But I Would Have So Wanted to Change the Ending,8,5 February 2006,"I actually recall seeing CHARADE when if first the movie houses in 1963, and it has remained a fond memory ever since - one of the examples of a clever plot with a good cast and a surprisingly adroit director. Stanley Donen is best recalled for his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s on several of the best MGM musicals (usually working with Gene Kelly). But it is an interesting surprise that in the 1960s he did two thrillers (CHARADE and ARABESQUE) which were very well done indeed. CHARADE is about Reggie Lambert, a woman about to get divorced from her American husband. But before the divorce can get underway she learns her husband has been brutally murdered (we see his body thrown off a train). Soon she meets Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) who starts befriending, even romancing her - but their relationship is twisted when it turns out his name is not Peter Joshua but Alexander Dial, the brother of a man who was killed in a suspicious incident during World War II, where a fortune in gold was lost. Although the Germans apparently were responsible, the suspicion was that the men guarding the gold hid it, to divide it up later on. These men are James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass, a dead soldier named Carson Dial, and the deceased husband of Hepburn. The three living ex-G.I.s are in Paris - they had apparently tracked down Hepburn's husband, and one of them may have killed him. But each denies this, and suspicion is also on Grant (supposedly for the share of his dead sibling), and Hepburn. To add to the tensions, Hepburn is contacted by a Mr. Hamilton Bartholemew of the U.S. Embassy in Paris (Walter Matthau) who explains that the U.S. Government is interested in recovering the stolen gold.There are several mysteries in CHARADE: what happened to the fortune in gold; what is the game that Grant is playing (is he friend or foe to Hepburn); and who is bumping off the various ex-G.I.s. For as the film passes first one then the other is killed off. As these problems are wrapped up we reach the conclusion, a scary showdown in the empty Paris Opera House.Photographed in Paris, the film is also an able visual valentine to the great city. Only another Hepburn film, FUNNY FACE, shows as many romantic sites (a third one, HOW TO STEAL A MILLION, comes close too). It sort of fits the mood, with Grant romancing Hepburn in the great city.If you want to be totally surprised, I advise not reading beyond this point of this review. But if you want a personal observation read on:SPOILER COMING UP:All his career Cary Grant wanted to play a villainous part. He was always the hero (his roles in NONE BUT THE LONELY HEART and MR. LUCKY and SUSPICION were the closest to villains he played). This film was his last chance, and it would have been curious if he had played it as such. Oddly enough, the actual chief villain in the plot, Walter Matthau (as Carson Dial, pretending to be Mr. Bartholemew) was also at a crossroads. Most of Matthau's early film parts were villainous, such as the whip-happy tavern owner in THE KENTUCKIAN. However he had shown signs of being a ""good guy"". In A FACE IN THE CROWD, as a television executive, he tells off a scheming, collapsing, Andy Griffith that he'll be lucky in a year or two to be recalled as a has-been. And in ONIONHEAD, he was a good natured cook on a naval craft who befriends Griffith. Still his most recent performances were mostly villainous - as when he was the government adviser in FAILSAFE who recommends the accidental launching of an attack of Russia be followed up by a full scale sneak attack. I might add, to Matthau's later success, he demonstrated where he could his great sense of timing and humor.It has often struck me that if Donan and Grant had gotten together, rather than a routine romantic adventurer for Grant he should have been the killer and villain, and been the threat to Hepburn at the conclusion - that Matthau would have been great fumbling his way to rescuing her. There need not have been a romance between Matthau and Hepburn, but he could have saved her. After all, she had started the film married to a man with a secret about a government theft, and if she fell for a killer (as Grant would have been) it would have been consistent with her being a poor judge of character.",Charade
39,sol-kay,What do you think this is! Some kind of Schwade?,7,17 May 2007,"(Some Spoilers) With her marriage on the rocks UN interpreter Regina ""Reggie"" Lampert, Audrey Hepburn,is seriously considering filing for divorce against her never at home husband Charles but first she'll have to find him. Returning back home to Paris from a ski vacation in the Alps Reggie is first shocked to find that her very spacious apartment suite is totally empty of clothes and furniture. Later Reggie gets the shock of her life in finding that the police did in fact find Charles dead from being thrown from a speeding train.With this mysterious Peter Joshua, among his many other aliases, played by the very cheerful charming and witty Cary Grant popping up all over the place we're, both Reggie and the audience, walked through the movies very complicated plot that has to do with a missing 250,000.00 dollars in gold. The gold that was stolen from the French Resistance back in 1944. It seems that the CIA, back in 1944 when it was called the OSS, was involved in this transaction that was covertly sabotaged by four of it's very greedy and unpatriotic member. One of them included the now deceased Charles Lampert. The three surviving former OSS agents, or spies, Tex Herman & Lenny, James Coburn George Kennedy & Ned Glass, are now out looking for the stolen gold and feel that Reggie being that she was married to Charles, a member of the gang of four who suspected of stealing the money , knows where the missing cash is and will go so far as to commit murder to get it.The movie ""Charade"" has so many twists and turns that by the time that its over you feel like a pretzel in trying to follow them. There's Reggie and the mysterious Peter Joshua getting involved in all sorts of entanglements with the three former OSS agents in their attempt to find the missing money. The fact that the money is right in front of them, in what Charles had with him on the train at the time of his murder. This is all so obvious that for a moment I had the feeling that they were either too blind or drunk, on that rich exquisite and full bodied French wine, for them to see it and that includes both Reggie and Peter.Peter who changes identifies like you would change socks during the movie. From a member of the Rothschild family to the brother of one of the crooked OSS men, who was killed by the Germans, to an agent of the US Treasury Department or Diplomatic Corps or to just plain Gary Grant. The guy is just a bit, to say the least, too much for the already confused and befuddled Riggie to take. Riggie later gets in touch, in order to get a handle of just what exactly is going on, with the CIA's man in Paris the ultra secretive and shadowy H. Bartholemeu, Walter Matthau. Bartholemeu comes across as being so oily and slippery, in his keeping things to himself, that he looks like he was accidentally dropped into a barrel of crude oil, doesn't make things any better for her as well.It soon becomes obvious that one of the four surviving renegade OSS agents is the one who murdered Charles Lampert. With the other ex-OSS men getting knocked off one by one until there's none of the ex-OSS men left alive to find the stolen and missing cash it becomes quite clear that the killer might very well be the lovable and friendly Peter Joshua himself. An eccentric sort of a guy who's so harmless and lovable, even though he can get a bit testy and sarcastic when you push him too far, that you wouldn't worry at all about him being left alone with your teenage daughter or your pet poodle.Like they say looks can be deceiving and from what we've seen in Peter's strange and bizarre actions like taking showers with all his, except his shoes, clothes on he might very well not be what we, and Reggie, all think that he actually is: A happy go lucky bumbling, if not a bit fluttery between the ears, schmuck.",Charade
40,Lejink,Paris death match,7,11 December 2017,"Impossible to review this film without employing the term Hitchcockian so I'll get it over with right away. At times it seems as if all that's needed to complete the picture is for Audrey Hepburn to dye her hair blonde as elsewhere we have Cary Grant reprising his Roger Thornhill meets John Robbie persona, a plot with more twists and turns than a slalom ski-slope and more MacGuffins than you can shake a stick at.It helps when there's a supporting cast of the quality of Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy all playing cherche-la-femme in Paris as the newly widowed Hepburn learns she's inadvertently in possession of a secret of her lately murdered husband worth $250000. Director Donen keeps the surprises coming with pleasing regularity keeping the audience on the hop throughout until a denouement somehow reminiscent to me of ""The Third Man"".Underpinning all the kills and thrills is the chemistry between Grant and Hepburn as both play their parts and act their ages with great aplomb. It's fun to see Hepburn chasing Grant in an inversion of the norm although I don't think you'd find too many men running away from her. There are some surprisingly shocking images of the deaths of Hamilton and Coburn in particular and liberal doses of the type of black humour of which the Master would have been proud, none more so than when early on in the film, a supposed mourner sneezes over the deceased in his open casket. Inventively and stylishly directed, it perhaps lacks those directorial flourishes of you-know-who which stay in the memory, but the dialogue is smart, witty and occasionally risqué, the Parisian locations highly attractive and the playing excellent by all throughout.A fine homage to Hitch but with enough of its own identity and flair to entertain satisfactorily on its own merits.",Charade
41,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Fiction or non-fiction?,8,20 July 2019,"Rushed central romance aside, 'Charade (1963)' makes pretty much all the right moves to be correctly labelled as 'the greatest Hitchcock movie Hitchcock never made', even rising above the famed director's weaker efforts to be an entertaining, engagingly twisty time right the way through. The protagonist isn't quite as active as you'd like (Hepburn would have to wait a while until she could contend with the baddies herself in the superior 'Wait Until Dark (1967)') but she remains a compelling composite for the audience, assuredly navigating the complex web of lies known as the narrative with a keen mind and sharp wits. As I mentioned, the typical 'age-gap romance' is a little frustrating because it isn't developed all that well and sort of feels forced in for the sake of it, almost like it's included just because Grant can't be seen on screen without exuding some sense that he's an irresistible 'ladies' man' despite his age. It's lucky, then, that both key players make for enjoyable screen-presences and that their banter is actually quite charming. Plus, it helps that our leading man can apparently take a good-natured jab or two, evidenced by his odd but oddly funny fully-clothed shower. Occasionally, the picture does feel like it is getting confused as to who the protagonist is, with a couple fairly long segments dedicated purely to Grant's enigmatic every-man taking away from our otherwise steadfast connection with Hepburn's imperilled heroine. Still, this is a small issue and it allows for a fantastic, if out of the blue, fight sequence that's far more brutal than you'd expect - as are the various murders shown after the fact. It's this edge that keeps the stakes seeming real, even when the tone takes a turn for the comical or when the reveals start to come so fast that they almost tumble atop one another like some sort of last-minute pile-up. Indeed, it's the reveals themselves that make up the majority of the marketing for the movie (from what I can tell), so it's a good job that most of them are rather surprising - if not earth-shattering - and, even when they aren't, well thought out. The plot comes very close to being confusing but just about stays on the right side of that line, remaining a fun puzzle that you actively try to solve as it plays out. You never know who to trust, even the lead seems slightly suspicious, and the ending does a satisfying job of tying everything together. On the whole, the feature is a fast-moving, well-written and likeable experience. It does start to slow a little towards its mid-section, but it soon picks back up to culminate in a truly suspenseful and exciting climax. 8/10",Charade
42,dromasca,identity games,6,31 May 2019,"Had Stanley Donen directed only 'Singin' in the Rain' it would probably have been enough for him to have a place of honor in the history of cinema. But Donen has directed and produced many other successful films, most of them between the 50's and 70's of the last century. Blessed with a long life, Donen died two months ago, and on this occasion the local cinematheque screened a few of his films. On this occasion, we saw 'Charade', a typical blockbuster entertainment for that period, combining the genres of espionage thriller and romantic comedy, taking place in tourist advertising landscapes and casting famous celebrities whose clothes gave the tone of the fashion to the times. It's here that the James Bond series started.The main heroine of the film is an American young woman (Audrey Hepburn, permanently dressed impeccably by the Givenchy house) who finds herself a widow of a husband she did not know much about and whom she was planning to divorce, deprived of the comfortable life she had before, in an illustrated postcards Paris. Moreover, she is suspected by the French police of being involved in her husband's violent death and becomes the target of the pursuit of a gang of picturesque gangsters who are convinced that she is the possessor of a wealth she has no idea about. She is helped or at least seems to be by another American in Paris (Cary Grant, about 26 years older on screen and in reality) and a clerk of the American embassy (Walter Matthau). Our heroine will inevitably fall in love with the older man despite the age difference, but he also seems to hide more than one secret and will assume successively several different identities. The love story and action thriller progress in parallel with the game of changing identities of the hero, with the young woman having to guess and choose permanently between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys' while the number of corpses increases.The introduction scene and the generic are so modern that in the first two or three minutes I was wondering whether I entered the wrong cinema hall and I was seeing a new movie. I cannot say the same about everything that followed. I never was a great enthusiast of Cary Grant's type of actor and I believe that the difference in age between him and Audrey Hepburn makes the relationship between them on screen look not so credible in this movie. High quality acting creations can rather be found in the secondary roles, and here we have an exceptional cast including Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy, all of them gorgeous actors. Paris of the 1960s looks very well, filmed with the characters one in pursuit of the other. It is said that 'Charade' is Hitchcock's best film that was not filmed by Hitchcock. The reason is that around the same period the master of suspense made several films based on spy stories, including 'North by Northwest', which also features Cary Grant, or 'Topaz', which also takes place in part in Paris. I believe that Hitchcock would have been able to get more out of this movie, perhaps with different casting, perhaps with a more subtle use of the identity mysteries in order to create a denser suspense atmosphere. I am sure however that he would have liked Henry Mancini's music. Anyway, 'Charade' remains now, 56 years after being released, overall, more than honorable entertainment.",Charade
43,Irishchatter,A funny yet brilliant with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant!,8,11 March 2017,"I love how Audrey Hepburn's character became a purser this time as Cary Grant was sick and tired of filming romantic movies with other stars. Still it was quite romantic at the same time and to be honest, this film reminds you of James Bond a bit. It was even frightening too like I honestly didn't expect some of the scenes where I got a few jumpscares when one of the CIA agents got killed by Walter Matthau's character! I suppose in the 60's, they were experiencing the darker side of stories rather than mostly the sweet movies from the 1950's you normally would see! I swear Hepburn was just stunning as usual on this like really, she should've starred in more movies with Grant as she was the right woman for him to play as his lover. I even liked her yellow coat, it just looked fabulous on her, no wonder girls would want to be like her. I have to say, I would be the same myself if I wasn't so lazy lol! Anyways this was a great film with a lotta action and of course having three legends on this, makes the movie very enjoyable to watch. I give this a 8/10!",Charade
44,vincentlynch-moonoi,"Something not quite right, but still good",7,5 June 2013,"Cary Grant is my favorite actor, and this is a good film...but not his best (although far better than ""To Catch A Thief""). Every time I've watched this film, I've though there is just something not quite right here, but I've never been able to put my finger on it.Grant is charming as ever, even as a potential murderer. Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story.The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming.But there's still something not quite right. Let's put it this way: I probably have 20 Cary Grant in my DVD collection, but this is not one of them. Not saying pass it up, but just not my favorite, or close to it.",Charade

Cary Grant is Peter Joshua, a man she casually meets on vacation.Not only is the murder mysterious, the entire back story that unfolds is filled with allegations and innuendos that confuse Reggie. She leans on Peter for emotional assistance, never sure whom she can trust.I really enjoy the way the plot unfolds at a gentle pace in the early going, developing the characters. After every revelation, there are more questions. The viewer, like Reggie, is never sure where to place his allegiances.There is a fitting Mancini score. And some comedic moments that Hitchcock would have approved. A chance to see Hepburn and Grant together should not be missed.",Charade

Hepburn and Grant are absolutely charming in this suspenseful comedy. The age difference between the two is awkward with regard to romance, but the script cleverly makes light of it by including jokes about it. The plot has holes in it and it's fairly easy to guess the identity of the killer. However, it is so entertaining that any shortcomings can be overlooked. The terrific supporting cast includes Mathau, Coburn, and Kennedy. With his stylish direction, Donen does an excellent Alfred Hitchcock impersonation.",Charade
47,johnnyboyz,The script picks this film up and just carries it the entire distance.,8,27 September 2006,"The one thing that this film really has going for it the entire time is, indeed, the script. Never once does it let itself down and never once does it shy away from what it should be doing. The script has a certain degree of cynicism in it and this adds to the comedy throughout. After the early exchanges and dialogue, it could've gone done a slightly different route and taken a more serious approach but it didn't and credit where credit's due because it stuck to its guns. Everything is quick and witty and this is blended it with a very interesting and mysterious atmosphere which really works well.Often the film will make you laugh and there are simply too many one-liners and jokes within the dialogue to list. This works well in juxtaposition with the air of mystery and murder also contained throughout. People may be dying rather gruesome and unpleasant deaths throughout but the fact 'they all died in their pyjamas' is a fantastic example that you shouldn't really take it too seriously. In fact, it's like the film is actually ashamed of being too graphic and too serious, but it works in its own little unique way. The music also adds to this experience as it's often rather dark and foreboding and to me, it sounded a little ahead of its time.What's also interesting is the setting. We really do see both sides of the city of Paris in this film. You have grotty hotels and dank little streets but there's also the element of romance thrown in amongst a wonderful boat ride scene. This is ultimately a hint as to the love interest forming between the two of them from one characters point of view, at least. Also; the dialogue, bizarrely enough, actually echoes when the scene is taken under a bridge via the boat ride even though it doesn't LOOK like they're on location. It was a nice touch, anyway.The story clearly plays second fiddle to the script as Grant's character takes on so many different aliases; it's close to impossible to keep up on a first viewing. The fact that all of the characters whom are 'at war' with one another within the narrative are all within a few feet of one another pretty much throughout the film is another odd thing about this film but it doesn't detract too much.A final thought is the scene where the child asks James Coburn's character 'if he's a real cowboy' or not. A rather quaint little 'nod' to 'The Magnificent Seven' from three years earlier.",Charade
48,Red-125,Did they see the same movie I saw?,6,7 December 2014,"Charade (1963) was directed by Stanley Donen. It stars Cary Grant as the mysterious Peter Joshua, Audrey Hepburn as the clueless Regina Lampert, and Walter Matthau as Hamilton Bartholemew, the world's dumbest CIA agent.For me, this movie only had one positive aspect--Audrey Hepburn was incredibly beautiful, and she looked great in Givenchy. Other than that, the movie was ridiculous. The plot involves buried treasure--more or less--and three violent men who are as convincing as the Three Stooges, and a supposed chemistry between Grant and Hepburn.The repartee between Hepburn and Grant is about as sparkling as yesterday's ginger ale. The plot is ridiculous, and the denouement is incredibly bad. What I don't understand is how this film can be carrying an extremely high rating of 8.0 from IMDb viewers. My thoughts are that maybe people had a very different outlook about plot in the early 1960's, or they were so dazzled by Hepburn's beauty that they didn't care about the plot.If you want to see this film, it will work well on DVD. However, don't blame me when you get to the part where--in the middle of death and danger--Hepburn asks Grant how he manages to shave in the cleft of his chin. Not kidding.",Charade
49,SAMTHEBESTEST,Cary Grant finally gets an entertaining suspense thriller that he couldn't get with Hitchcock. An underrated Classic !,8,3 June 2020,"Charade (1963) :
Brief Review -Cary Grant finally gets an entertaining suspense thriller that he couldn't get with Hitchcock. Charade is unexpectedly a great mixture of Comedy, Romance, Mystery and Thriller that you just can't hate. Charade is fully deserving to be known as 'Best Hitchcock movie that Hitchcock never made'. A story of a window who is pursued by several men for the sake of fortune which her murdered husband had stolen. Charade is a great script i must say, although screenplay is imperfectly perfect. The first meeting of Grant and Hepburn doesn't sound like a real incident. Come on, a formal hello to stranger doesn't make you fall in love. But after that, Charade is flawless for next 110 minutes and you will keep counting the twists it has till 'The End' slate appears. Cary Grant worked in 4 films of Hitchcock but to be frank i Personally found most of them overrated, especially after watching Charade those films surely looks overrated or may be Charade is Underrated. Charade has more twists than all those Hitchcok-Grant films which are known as classics and additionally Charade is more entertaining and more romantic. Now you can compare these 5 films of Grant and Charade might just Top the list. Cary Grant plays a very healthy character in charade as he's constantly changing his identity and making us blow away and when you just think no he's telling the truth this time, he's actually got more twists to follow. Even the last scene of the film has a surprise for you. Like i said he finally gets more entertaining and more twisty thriller he couldn't get with Hitchcock and thanks to god for making it happen during the last phase of his career. Audrey Hepburn looks elegant and sizzles with Grant. She got most of the laughter lines to mouth. The only problem is Grant looked too old for her with those white hairs and old look. Kudos to Stanley Donen for making a solid compilation of 4 genres and delivering a Classic Movie. You know mixing 4 genres and still making a logical and engaging film is a very tough job and Donen did it exceptionally well. Charade is Must Watch and deserves more recognition by the audience. 7.9/10 is surely Underrated for this Awesome Show.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Charade
50,arfdawg-1,A Very 60s Trifle,6,3 April 2017,"The Plot. Regina Lampert, a Paris based American, has decided to divorce her Swiss husband, Charles Lampert, because of the secrets and lies that have pervaded their marriage, she coming to the conclusion that she no longer loves him and really knows nothing about him. Before she can make that request to Charles, he is found dead, seemingly pushed off a Paris to Bordeaux train. While Regina was on holiday in Megève, Charles sold all their possessions making $250,000 in the process, and seemed to be on his way to the coast to leave the country for South America probably for good. The money, however, was not among his possessions on the train, those possessions which are returned to Regina. Regina further learns from Hamilton Bartholomew of the CIA that they were after him, Charles Lampert only the primary alias he has been using of late.So first of all, this is a VERY 60's film. The music and costumes are all ""mod."" which makes the movie rather dated. Cary Grant was pushing 60 when he made this movie. But he's never dated. The issue with the movie is the dialog which is snappy and out of place. It's as if they wanted to make this a pithy comedy drama instead of a straight dramatic presentation. It doesn't really work.Plus it's a rather slow and talkative movie low on action. And Audrey Hepburn is a think of the past. Her ""acting abilities really don't fit today. As I said earlier, VERY 60's.",Charade

Loosely in the Hitchcock mode.  Grant takes on 4 names as a playboy ""thief""/secret agent/etc.  It's just a bit too whimsical, the villains too ""bad.""  Still, it's a fun little romp -- I especially remember the scene where Grant has to fight George Kennedy with a hook-arm on the rooftop.  The romantic moments seem contrived, though, and Hepburn is very young for Grant -- as usual, the film takes no notice of this.  Nice location photography, solid but not exceptional direction by Donen.",Charade
52,jzappa,The Bounty Hunter or Date Night in 1963 Terms,6,24 October 2011,"Charade is supposedly the result of Singin' In The Rain's director gambling his better hand on a Hitchcockian thriller. There are echoes of and references to Spellbound, Stage Fright and North by Northwest, but rather than being remotely Hitchcockian, Charade is silky, glittery, childish, overacted and far too self-aware to be in any way thrilling. Cary Grant referring to Audrey Hepburn's apartment ""on the street where you live"" is the kind of fun little reference to the musical work of his stars that Stanley Donen would probably be interested in. Frankly, if Donen had adjoined musical numbers or a repertoire of prominent theme songs, that kind of consistency would've made it glorious, but in its present condition it's a trivial case of star-cuddling.Everything is too bouncy, there is no danger, even for the foundling-like Audrey Hepburn moving up and down on waves of trickery after her worthless husband disappears and is reported dead. With this pitch established, the film's march of assassinations and laborious twists are carried with a jolly indifference, punchlines to frivolous gags. It would have a sense of anticipation of tension if Donen didn't capture Paris as a silky castle in the sky. This movie is so flippant and vain, it skirts on scatterbrained. However, the writing is clever, and if Cary Grant is your leading man, you might as well take full advantage of that fact.Grant was more overstatedly Grant in this movie than he'd been in anything since his slapstick days, that manic persona translated with age into his trademark broken bluster, puckered look of offended sensibilities, his ribbing impression of being able to get precisely what he wants if he could only afford the sweat. When one particular hooligan, out of a zanily over-the-top group of such brutes, pushes him to a rooftop with the intent of teaching him to fly, Grant is so earnestly matter-of-fact: ""All right, but the view better be worth it."" He's superb, but Donen's lack of economy in indulging his charisma plugs up the momentum like brakes on what's supposed to be a racecar.Hepburn is a good equal, all jolts and moans, carrying the kind of frustrated babe-in-the-woods openness of her Susy Hendrix in Wait Until Dark, although far more virginal. The most un-Hitchcockian thing about the movie is watching them become smitten, which ironically would be significantly expedited if she could solve where his allegiances truly lie. There is a tangle of secrets and deceit to decipher, and the location of a hoard of money her dead husband had supposedly pilfered from his friends, played with casual heartlessness by James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. But the plot is mere lip service. It's the sagging of Hepburn's suspicion that matters, and the anchoring of Grant's contrariness. Just slurp the silky romance of the movie's most famed line, as Hepburn's intoxicated Regina rends her heart asunder: ""Do you know what's wrong with you?"" she asks of Peter. ""Nothing.""",Charade
53,elshikh4,Magic and Sparkle !,8,22 March 2012,"I remember how my cinema professor was left agape when I told him that I love (Stanley Donen), (Vincente Minnelli) and movie like (Casablanca). He thought that cinema is all about (Stanly Kubrick) only!What's wrong about some glamour time? In fact, it's so right. Having a fun time is what movies were grounded on. And still are to a considerable extent; if only well-made. And in the case of (Charade), it is very well made.First of all, the script. I adore it. Look how it creates a real charade by making a story of a crime, a conflict of evil associates which leads to more crimes, with dividing the truths, hiding them, then giving them away one by one, to design a movie of non-stop murders, surprises and twists all along. Not only this, it leads this thriller hand in hand with a romantic comedy that has snappy smart lines. So the catchy formula perfects. I bet Hitchcock was jealous!Add to that, the star value. Ahhh, it can't get any better than this. (Audrey Hepburn) is a dream, especially in that blue pajama. She had that iconic face and humor, lighting the screen with a smile, a gaze, or maybe a scream. And (Cary Grant) is the very definition of this movie, as a combination of sparkle and magic. He's a load of charisma, fun, vitality. The thing is you wouldn't believe his performance only; you have to fall in love with his persona also. Very few starts in the history of cinema can reach this zenith while being in their third act (Grant was 59 year old at the time, and he retired from movies for good - after couple of more movies - in 1966). 3 moments of him had his stamp utterly, forcing you to re-watch them with increasing fun every time; showering with his suit on, picking the orange competition; where Hepburn was laughing for real I suppose, and the funny face that he came up with at the last scene; which was very much the best parody out of the audience's reaction towards this heavy long run of twists up to that point (which was very early for a movie back then). The rest of the cast is fine to say the least, with their different looking and speaking characters.Then, the magic continues. A music score by (Henry Mancini). That guy was elegance to movie music. He wrote, as usual, a fascinating theme. And this time, it could be played whether as interestingly suspenseful or tearfully romantic. I loved the way it's played in the dining boat scene; with a vocal version of it, or in the amusement center scene; as a part of the place's music, like the whole movie is amusement center. Why writing a theme song to be played in different arrangements throughout a movie seems so old and forgotten these days?! Undoubtedly it was part of yesterday's special charm. The cinematography is pure cozy, rather analgesic with deeply worm colors. It's the classically dazzling Hollywood movie image back then. (Stanley Donen)'s directing did very good. The fight over the building is memorable. Mixing the on-location shots with the in-studio ones was done adeptly. However I think that the best thing (Donen) achieved here was his 2 leading stars' so smooth performance and interplay.Though, (Hepburn)'s character was unconvincing. I didn't buy her as someone under stress or afraid for most of the time. She was having fun, falling in bottomless love with (Grant)'s character, and not having the slightest problem at all, which was a problem for me, the only problem this movie has in my viewpoint.There are some nice references along the way: mentioning American in Paris by (Gene Kelly) who's an old friend of (Stanley Donen); they co-directed together 3 classic musicals (On the Town - 1949), (It's Always Fair Weather - 1955), and (Singin' in the Rain - 1952). Or a line like: ""I taught them everything they know"", said by (Grant) about the young lovers' kisses, not as his character in the movie, but as himself; the romantic lead of countless movies. In terms of references to himself, (Grant) didn't feel shy admitting his age, and for more than once (the glasses to read is one), I think at the time he held a position of a ""movie star"" that allowed him to be (Cary Grant) more than his character here, whatever its true name was, and the movie friendlily toyed with that for honoring purpose.The last scene has it all. The 2 stars shine with magic. The boy, old boy, speaks to his girl about marriage; assuring that every love story has to end with marriage; noticing the decorous time; which I personally love and long for. And it's the movie's last surprise, twist, whatever.. when (Grant) turns out to be a government agent; now see how that script played with the cards brilliantly, switching them to make the real thief (Walter Matthau) as the policeman, and the real policeman as the thief (Grant doesn't stop lying from the start about his identity, deciding - until this moment - that he's a thief). Sure this was the script's best game, and it saved it for last.This is nothing but great entertainment. It's full of magic's sparkle or sparkle's magic, well, you name it. At any case, worth the love, the DVD, and the fight with that snob professor!P.S: Don't care much for the remake (The Truth About Charlie - 2002) (Yes, they had the guts to remake THIS!). Enough to tell that they handed over the role of (Cary Grant) to (Mark Wahlberg)!!!!!!!!!",Charade
54,Polaris_DiB,Only Hepburn gets to be herself,9,8 January 2010,"Stanley Donen and Audrey Hepburn certainly had a lot of chemistry as a director/actress duo, one only slightly matched by Hepburn and Cary Grant's on-screen chemistry. Charade is just simply damned good mystery entertainment, at times thrilling, funny, and occasionally bewildering. It's one of them twist upon a twist upon a twist movies (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn) set in the gorgeous backdrop of Paris (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn) and featuring an almost automatic romance between a couple who are basically ready to jump each other's bones from frame one but have to worry through all that plot first (see: Paris When It Sizzles, also starring Audrey Hepburn). Unlike Paris When It Sizzles, however, it's not all just meta ultimately pointing to one sole purpose, but has some really gripping storytelling.This is the type of movie where I had the killer figured out within a moment, but it didn't exactly mean the story was all that predictable. My favorite part of it is the constantly changing relationships of the characters as they all vie around each other attempting to gain the upper hand. Hepburn's own doe-faced surprise at every turn is less a character under duress and more an audiences' chorus as she watches with bright eyes the layers peeling back in front of her. If there's any real unbelievability to the movie, it's that she has so much patience for it, or if she has that she's ever telling the truth during the many times she says, ""I'm scared"".--PolarisDiB",Charade

I think this was the first Cary Grant movie I've seen.I've watched it several times since then, and I can say that this is a total classic in the way movies are made. It's a mystery set in glamorous location with money, murder, and intrigue at it's core.The movie's plot, acting, and cinematography has become dated since it was made, but this was the kind of entertainment people went to movies for back in the early '60s.I wouldn't say that this is the best movie Cary Grant or Audrey Hepburn made, but production is very good, and although following a pat formula, there are no other movie quite like it. It holds its charm and originality still after half a century.",Charade
56,robfollower,"Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn Splendid, shades Of Hitchcock...",9,18 August 2019,"I have heard ""Charade"" (1963) with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn called the best Alfred Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never directed. It has all the trademarks of the master of suspense - a tense fast-paced plot, humor and great acting. It's fun watching Cary Grant (who starred in 4 Hitchcock films) and Audrey Hepburn being chased around Paris by bad guys trying to get their hands on the money that Hepburn's dead husband stole from them. Grant is his usual debonair self and Hepburn looks super chic in those Givenchy outfits.
A terrifically entertaining comedic-thriller.",Charade
57,Lechuguilla,Paris In The Early Sixties,3,5 November 2017,"Owing to the romantic setting of Paris and the haute couture style of the two lead actors, ""Charade"" fits right in with the cultural ambiance of early 1960s Camelot. Producers could not have picked two lead performers more suited for such a pretentious film: the annoyingly suave Cary Grant and the annoyingly sophisticated Audrey Hepburn. Completing the ensemble of annoying contributors is Henry Mancini, with his dreamy ""romantic"" music; mercifully, the film doesn't contain his song ""Moon River"".The voluminous dialogue driven script is a mess, as it is as contrived and talky as we would expect for early 1960s haughty Hollywood. Worst segment is the ""romantic"" riverboat ride at night, all schmaltzy and dreamy, that just reeks of Camelot idealism. Further, the plot's alternating humor and murder is unsettling. It conveys the impression that both Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) and Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) are both plagued either by ten second attention spans, or worse, self-deception, wherein multiple deaths in two hours function merely as inconvenient intrusions into their budding love affair.All that said, the mystery element is pleasantly reminiscent of Agatha Christie's film ""And Then There Were None"". And the final few scenes are suspenseful. The whodunit element is rather easy to figure out for most of us, except for the giddily delusional and oh-so-naïve Regina Lampert. The plot's predictability in turn results in a somewhat disappointing ending.Color cinematography is average. I didn't notice any problems, but nothing about the visuals struck me as being overtly laudable, either.""Charade"" has no significant message to impart. It's a mainstream film that provides a pleasing two hours of diversionary entertainment for a star-struck mass audience. But the dreamy, romantic, sophisticated style of Grant, Hepburn and Mancini, set in romantic Paris, makes me yearn for a rowdy Western wherein old, cantankerous characters lacking teeth get dirty and cuss up a storm.",Charade
58,smatysia,Hepburn for the ages,8,8 April 2002,"A very entertaining film, but with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, how could it be otherwise? By the way, there's nothing wrong with Donen making a suspense film. Alfred Hitchcock did not own the genre, except figuratively. And the suspense elements of the movie were well-done, but not quite up to AH standards. But those are high standards, indeed. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Some of the plot twists, I did not see coming. But with the Matthau character, I just knew that there was more than met the eye. In any case, this is a film to add to one's collection. Grade: A",Charade

I wished it wouldn't end. This is definitely one of my favorite movies. Even though this is the first movie I watch in which Audrey Hepburn plays, all I can say is that she did her job wonderfully and now I wanna see more of her. I didn't get bored one second. I liked the way the story went very easily from the moments of suspense to the flirtation and romance scenes between Peter (Cary Grant) and Regina (Audrey Hepburn) and then going back to the mistery and confusion, having irony and humour all the way and a lot of plot twits and unexpected moments that I really enjoyed. I just loved every minute of it and I will totally watch it again someday!",Charade
60,barnabyrudge,Expertly packaged Hitchcock imitation - a really satisfying and watchable movie.,9,24 April 2006,"1963 was a good year for Hitchcock imitations, what with the superb The Prize and the delightful Charade. In Charade, it is the turn of great musical director Stanley Donen to show that there's more to his talent than song-and-dance routines and Gene Kelly getting rained on. A surprisingly sinister film, which expertly releases the tension with moments of charm and wit before reapplying it with a vengeance, Charade is engrossing from beginning to end. It is ludicrous, of course, with so many outrageous twists that in the wrong hands it would have looked somewhat absurd. But with Donen at the helm, and a cast of sublime actors, its improbabilities can be forgiven with ease.Unhappily married Parisian beauty Reggie Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is contemplating divorcing her husband when she learns that she will not have to bother doing so. Poor old Charles Lampert was murdered on a train while she was away on vacation in Switzerland. Reggie also learns that her late husband was involved in the theft of $250,000 worth of gold during WWII from the American army payroll. It seems that he may have been murdered by one of his gold-snatching accomplices, perhaps someone keen to increase his share by reducing the number of shareholders? Amongst the suspects are one-armed thug Scobie (George Kennedy), sneaky Gideon (Ned Glass) and the vicious Tex (James Coburn). The three hoods, all participants in the afore-mentioned gold heist, decide that Reggie must know where her husband hid the fortune.... so they terrorise her, hoping to intimidate her into revealing its whereabouts. Bewildered and frightened, Reggie's only hope is that a suave stranger (Cary Grant) can protect her.... but is he really her knight in shining armour, or just another killer trying to claim the stolen loot?Charade moves with breathless speed from one scene to the next, rarely pausing long enough for one to notice how far-fetched it all is. The dialogue between Grant and Hepburn is superbly written and just as superbly delivered, with some priceless and very quotable lines. Henry Mancini's score is perfect throughout, with a lovely bounciness in the picture-postcard scenes around Paris, but a sense of heightened tension during the suspense sequences. The revelations are concealed well, with the truth about who is who and what is what kept well disguised until the very end. On the whole, Charade is splendid entertainment.",Charade
61,MissSimonetta,The best of the three collaborations between Audrey Hepburn and Stanley Donen,10,5 May 2019,"CHARADE is like a cinematic ice-cream sundae: it goes down easy, a light, frothy adventure filled with suspense, romance, and intrigue.Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant share tremendous, easy chemistry. Unlike Gary Cooper in LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON or Fred Astaire in FUNNY FACE, Hepburn actually shares a sexual spark with Grant and you can buy the two as love interests despite the age difference.The plot is filled with twists and turns, keeping you on your toes no matter how often you revisit it. It's also very funny, with sparkling banter and a wry sense of gallows humor which fits the movie like a glove.Tight storytelling, memorable use of color, fine acting-- this movie's got it all.",Charade

Grant & Hepburn are wonderful as a couple involved in this twisted plot that starts with Hepburn's husband being killed and running across Grant quite by accident(not really). Grant really showed up for a reason, but to tell you too much about the reason would ruin the movie for everyone.  This movie has well-done character roles played by many young actors who end up with leading roles later in their careers.(Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy).  Everyone plays their parts a little tongue-in-cheek despite the seriousness of the situation which makes the movie very watchable.  This (to me) is a very overlooked classic by director Stanley Donen and deserves a look by many more.",Charade
63,Cristi_Ciopron,The Carson Dyle enigma,9,6 November 2009,"Donen aimed at and succeeded in making a cool thriller—a true marvel of pace, of fun and of suspense—hugely enjoyable by its atmosphere, pace, screwball, sense of chic and the wonderful clever snappy script.CHARADE may look like Hitchcock only to people who don't know Hitchcock; otherwise, not—though there are, of course, things which invite comparison. CHARADE is a lively somewhat sumptuous extravaganza, beautifully filmed and indeed gorgeously scored, made with a sure hand, a kind of treat for the Grant fans, with villains a la 'James Bond'—iron claws and all that, and also a sprightly comedy in Parisian setting, its touch of screwball brought by Audrey harassing Cary; not very much of a spoof or a pastiche. And Hitchcock would have never directed this comedy.'How can you tell if anyone's lying or not?' CHARADE is a dependable piece of fun. The King of the Hollywood musicals was 39 when he made this thriller; besides his Astaire movies, Donen made other films with Mrs. Hepburn and with Grant. In CHARADE, Mrs. Hepburn speaks about Gene Kelly and his Parisian film.",Charade
64,drystyx,What's not to like?,10,4 March 2007,"The best way to start a review of ""Charade"" is to ask ""What's not to like""? The movie is a very smart and engaging murder mystery. One of the most physically gorgeous women ever (at least to male audiences), Audrey Hepburn, finds out more and more about her dead husband, including his real name. She encounters Cary Grant early, and they hit it off with lines that are so classic in their appeal, that most later movies tried to emulate them. Add to this you have two of the greatest giants ever leading an all star cast, and you have everything going for it. The scenes smartly go from different emotions with smart segues. You have humor, suspense, romance, intrigue, mystery, action. You've got it all. So many ingredients make this even better than a great movie. And to top it off, easily the most creative and best movie death scene ever in any movie makes this a ""must see"".",Charade
65,EUyeshima,Lessons in Sophistication by Two Peerless Masters,9,18 April 2006,"One can be grateful that Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn co-starred at least this one time during their illustrious careers since they were likely the two most sophisticated, urbane stars to grace the screen. Just saying their names together and the chemistry between them seems assured. They were supposed to appear together in ""Roman Holiday"" and ""Sabrina"" (according to Marc Eliot's recent biography on Grant), but in retrospect, it's probably a blessing that they waited until 1963 when both were at the peak of their abilities exuding a confidence that is deceptively casual. Stanley Donen, who had worked with both actors before, has expertly directed a supremely entertaining thriller juggling suspense with a romantic comedy sensibility.Although many consider this film derivative of Hitchcock, in particular, ""North by Northwest"" (also strongly recommended), I have to say that Donen sets up Grant much more convincingly as a potential villain than Hitchcock did in ""Suspicion"". It's also obvious that Donen adores Hepburn (consider ""Funny Face"" and ""Two for the Road"", the latter especially recommended), and in this, arguably the least of their collaborations, she is far more interesting and provocative than the usual damsel in distress. Perhaps liberated by her then-recent Holly Golightly in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", she is surprisingly forthright sexually with Grant. Much of the credit also needs to be given to screenwriter Peter Stone, who penned a clever script revolving around a young wife in Paris named Regina Lampert, whose husband is mysteriously murdered, and then is besieged by a gallery of unsavory characters, her husband's old WWII Army buddies (a Texas-twanged James Coburn and a scarifying George Kennedy among them). Providing protection, sort of speak, are a solicitous U.S. intelligence agent named Bartholomew, played with characteristic dryness by Walter Matthau, and of course, Grant, debonair as ever under various pseudonyms starting with Peter Joshua. Twists and turns abound amid the glamorous Paris settings, Hepburn's smart Givenchy clothes and several comedy set pieces like the rolling orange game in the nightclub, some steamy nuzzling in an interpreter's booth and Grant's impromptu ""drip dry"" shower.Even though the ending is never really in question, the journey there is quite enjoyable as it hinges on whether Grant will ever inspire Hepburn's trust and on all of the characters getting their hands on a stash of money left behind by Regina's dead husband, the form of which provides one of the more intriguing plot turns. I particularly like the climactic, much-imitated chase scenes through the Paris metro and ending on a stage with a tic-tac-toe trapdoor awaiting the fate of the villain. The Henry Mancini score certainly sustains the suspense and romance topped off by the familiar title theme. If you can get your hands on the Criterion Collection DVD, the film transfer is exceptional, and Donen and Stone provide insightful, often quite funny commentary on an alternate track. This is one classy thriller and great fun.",Charade
66,Boyo-2,Flawless entertainment,9,16 July 2001,"Well if your starting line-up is Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant being directed by Stanley Donen, you know going in you have a fairly good shot at creating something great.  And the three of them did. This is a perfect combination of romance, comedy, suspense and action.
You are kept guessing the entire time who is who and since the movie moves so well and is so completely entertaining, you are going to have a great time watching this.  Add three actors who would go on to win Supporting Oscars - Walter Matthau, George Kennedy and James Coburn - all of whom are very funny and menacing. Kennedy, Coburn and Ned Glass make memorable entrances into the movie, one by one, each funnier than the last.  I am sure in 1963 this was thought of as a decent movie, no great big deal. Seen today, next to today's computer-generated movies and movie stars, it looks even better.  I am also reminded of the fact that Hollywood cannot even come up with anyone who can hold a candle to Grant and Hepburn in the class department.

She then gives chase to three of her late husband's World War II cronies, who are after a quarter of a million dollars the quartet stole while behind enemy lines.I really enjoyed this . It's a great story with some nice twists that have you guessing throughout. It looks great and has that 50's / 60's feel about it .
Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are great but you can definitely tell that Grant had his reservations about having a leading lady 25 years his junior and that shows in the brief love scenes .Being 60 years old , Cary Grant told the director he didn't want to get undressed for the shower scene , so he took it fully clothed and it turned out to be the most memorable scene in the film . You can see Hepburn is genuinely laughing .Because of the twists , this is one of those rare films that will look completely different on a second viewing .Good fun .",Charade

70,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Charade (1963),10,14 December 2011,"It takes a lot for a film to automatically jump into your favorites of all time. Charade is one of those rare films that did just that. Unfortunately ignored, mostly due to copyright mistakes made by the production company, this has been dubbed ""The greatest Hitchcock film Hitchcock never made"". It's certainly true that this owes a lot to the works of Hitchcock. Despite not adding much originality to the genre, it perfects every single facet. Charade is a classical romantic-comedy disguised as a spy thriller. The first noticeable sign that this is going to be brilliant is the witty and quick dialogue. Most comedies today don't generate so many belly laughs. This is a serious world, filled with real people. This means that everyone has a slight sense of humor, and interesting character quirks. The film also works by making Hepburn more of a predator than her older leading man. Her character is given much to work with as a woman looking for divorce, before discovering her husband has been murdered. A great thing about this film is that it has so many twists, and you only see them approaching seconds before the reveal. This film kept me guessing, excited, smiling, and intrigued. An absolute gem from when Hollywood crafted masterpieces.",Charade
71,nycritic,Cary and Audrey = Movie Magic,8,18 February 2006,"If Audrey Hepburn fell in love and blossomed to luminous womanhood in Paris as Jo Stockton in FUNNY FACE, CHARADE -- Stanley Donen's very Hitchockian thriller complete with Saul Bass-like opening credits -- has her not only falling in love but in constant danger from some stylish baddies who are after some 250,000 dollars which her late husband stole during the war. A convoluted plot in which Cary Grant and Walter Matthau swap more identities than two schizophrenics suffering from multiple personality disorder, requiring us to look closely and keep a scoreboard, CHARADE is quite straightforward -- since everyone is after the 250,000 and Hepburn must rely on Grant for protection even if he may at times be shady, it's inevitable that a romance will develop even when things get hairy (and they do). Both Grant and Hepburn exude an irresistible charm as a couple and it's a pity they did not work together after this film because despite the constant twists and turns and identity changes in the plot, they're the ones who light up the screen on their presence alone. CHARADE was remade in 2002 as Jonathan Demme's THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE with Thandie Newton channeling Audrey every moment she was on screen in the lead role and Mark Wahlberg in the Cary Grant role.",Charade
72,JuguAbraham,"Charming, but definitely not a classic",7,8 January 2004,"Viewing the film after a gap of 35-40 years, I am surprised at how the film is considered to be a top-notch movie.The film's script leaves me cold early into the film: what is the credibility of the leading lady who marries a man, who has no job, no friends and seems to know little else about him except that he has a Swiss passport. The church/undertaker's hall scene, though humorous, is unconvincing with no priests/undertakers and unlike the rest of the film seems unusually close to a stylized black comedy. Anyone who knows philately will know that costly stamps are not stuck on envelopes and peeled off envelopes as shown in the film.Nonetheless, there are aspects of the script that you do not forget easily. The James Coburn and his burning matchsticks scene in the phonebooth are a highlight. So are the chicken and liver wurst sequence with Walter Matthau, hilarious as it unfolds but lacking in credibility when you reach the end of the film. Are smart dialogues the criterion to judge good screenplays?Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are great to watch but are they providing great performances? Even Henry Mancini has made better music for films than in this one. George Kennedy's character is never developed. The film seems to anticipate the James Bond films right from the title sequence.While I heartily agree the film is an enjoyable family film that keeps you engrossed as any good thriller should, I am surprised it made the grade of the top 250 films on this website. You might consider it to be a classic only if you were not exposed to the cinema made in France, Cuba, and Eastern Europe in the Sixties and Seventies.",Charade
73,lewiskendell,Dangerously funny!,7,30 October 2010,"""You can't even be honest about being dishonest!""Charade is a very funny spy/mystery about a dead man, a very large amount of missing money, a threatened widow who is clearly in over her head (Audrey Hepburn), a mysterious man with many names (Cary Grant), and three sinister, shadowy men. This movie has more twists and turns than it should even be possible to fit into 113 minutes, and every time you think you have it figured out, it smacks you in the nose with another curve-ball.The plot is a successful marriage of humor, murder, and danger. People die at every turn, yet there's a small or big laugh around every corner. Hepburn and Grant really get to flex their comedic muscles, thanks to a script that provides excellent banter for the two leads. Hepburn is her typical beautiful, charming, girlish, impossibly adorable self. No surprises there. And Grant handles both the funny and dangerous aspects of his character quite well, to the extent that you never quite know whether to trust him or not. There's great chemistry between the pair, almost to the level between Grant and Grace Kelly in To Catch a Thief. That's a huge compliment, as I absolutely love that movie.Charade does a lot of things very well. And while it stays safely on the side of light entertainment, and doesn't quite have the magic of some of my favorite classic movies, it's a fun movie to watch.

74,DeeNine-2,"A bit of a farce, but enjoyable",7,4 November 2002,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This is a distinctly Stanley Donen film (some others: Singin' in the Rain 1952, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers 1954, Funny Face 1957, Damn Yankees 1958, Indiscreet 1958) characterized by light comedy prepared expressly for the middle American palate a little past mid-century, professionally done with offense to no one. There is just the barest hint of satire with a few laugh-at-the-genre jokes but nothing so blatant as to detract from the woman's fantasy, wish-fulfillment that is the essential point.One of the jokes in the film is that Audrey Hepburn always kisses Cary Grant first. This is entirely appropriate, I suppose, considering that he was at the time 59-years-old and she was 34. Both were (and are) two of Hollywood's enduring stars, Miss Hepburn perhaps at or near the pinnacle of her career when this movie was made, and Cary Grant in his last significant role. The chemistry is nice, creative and there are some funny lines. She chases him and he catches her, is the way it is played, when of course it is usually the other way around: HE chases her and SHE catches him!The stars are given fine support from Walter Matthau, James Colburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass in quasi-comedic roles as a quartet of sinister bad guys. The music (and the memorable ""Charade"" theme) are by Henry Mancini whose musical scores adorned nearly a hundred Hollywood movies beginning in the fifties. I particularly remember his music from the Pink Panther flicks in the sixties and seventies.Director Stanley Donen, despite being a paragon of commercial success, has a quality of making sardonic fun of the audience or of his stars in a way that is barely discernible. I think it's the cynicism of the Hollywood product that he became so adept at making, and his subconscious realization of what he was doing, that sometimes seeps through. Here he begins with ""Boy Meets Girl, Cute"" in the Alps with Hepburn in a costume reminiscent of something out of the middle ages, covering almost as much of her as a burka, her beautiful eyes masked by big dark glasses. It's a joke and perhaps a setup for contrast. When Audrey Hepburn smiles and her eyes light up in delight, she is most arresting. Imagine the whole film without seeing her eyes. (In Blame It on Rio 1984, Donen deliberately had Michael Caine in those hideous square plastic frames big enough for Mrs.Doubtfire.) And what I mean by Donen's attitude toward his audience, that he believes they only want familiar escapism, is the touristy feel of the Parisian scenes in which most of the action takes place. They are mostly spots frequented by American tourists seeing Europe for the first time, the Seine, the Metro, the Arc d'Triumph, Notre Dame cathedral, the Louis XVI apartment sans furnishing, the Paris opera house, etc. The fact that we can't be sure who-done-it until the very end when it becomes obvious by the process of elimination, didn't sit well with me. I also did not like the chase scenes in the Metro because it seemed abundantly silly to imagine that Hepburn in her long skirt and dress shoes could outrun Cary Grant, who had, in a previous scene, engaged in fisticuffs a bigger man (Kennedy with a steel claw for one of his hands). Nonetheless, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn together for the first (and only) time is a treat not to be missed. Cary Grant is particularly good as he maintains a wry stoicism against the power of Miss Hepburn's charms. Noteworthy is the excellent camera work exemplified in the two shots of Hepburn's face caught in light and shadow in the Paris opera house.For those of you thinking of seeing Jonathan Demme's remake of this film, The Truth About Charlie (2002), I would caution against it since the unreality of the story borders on the ridiculous and must be played as comedy. Without the star power and some of the clever dialogue of Donen's film I am afraid the plot contrivances would be embarrassingly exposed, although the idea of getting a quarter of a million dollars past customs in the form of very expensive (hint: small) art objects that appear to be ordinary objects, is a nice device that would probably work.See this for Cary Grant whose rugged good looks and smooth and effortless delivery made him a Hollywood legend and the epitome of a suave leading man.",Charade

No, it was NOT directed by Sir Hitch. It is very much like one of his movies though. I loved the supporting actors of George Kennedy and Lee Marvin as well! Oh, and did I say I loved Walter Matthau? Well, he was simply amazing!! This movie will have you on the edge of your seat! Especially when Lee Marvin lights matches and tosses them into Audrey Hepburn in an effort to terrorize her!",Charade

A man has died and to the dismay of his wife his funeral is visited by one dodgy type after another.The rest of the film is a feast of ""who is who"" around the themes of the rich widow (""Suspicion"", 1941, Alfred Hitchcock) and the loot that has disappeared (""The ladykillers"", 1955, Alexander Mackendrick).On the one hand the film has no other pretention than giving two hours of entertainment. On the other hand director Stanley Donen has the guts to make a film in the style of the great Alfred Hitchcock. Only French directors like Henry Georges Clouzot en Claude Chabrol got away with this unscathed.That the film does not take itself too seriously spills over to the actors, and results in playful perforamces. In one scene Audrey Hepburn points to the characteristic cleft in the chin of Cary Grant and says: ""How do you shave in there?"".",Charade

Yes, great acting, intriguing story - but as eluded to by others, Audrey Hepburn fawning ad nauseam presents a completely unacceptable role model that was never and has never been acceptable. Just another statue from a bygone time.",Charade
78,jaredmobarak,Punch and Judy,8,22 July 2006,"After seeing the dismal Jonathan Demme film The Truth About Charlie, I was left aghast. The film had so much going for it, but besides the surreal, New Wave feel of the end, just before the credits, it was a major letdown. I flipped the disc over upon completion to check out the bonus movie, Charade, which it was based on. I fast-forwarded it a bit and discovered the dialogue was much the same in that part, so I took it out and returned the rental. Now, four years later, I finally took the plunge and sat down to watch Stanley Donen's highly acclaimed Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn vehicle. This one is a winner.After only seeing Grant in Notorious, I wasn't quite ready for the comic chops he shows here, (even though I have heard so much about them from lovers of Bringing Up Baby). The quick wit was enjoyable as he and Hepburn were a great comic team. Sarcasm flowed freely from their lips and helped lay the tracks for why a love tryst could work between a 60 year old man and a 30 year old woman. I'm not quite sure if they tried to make Hepburn's Reggie older, as she looked it in parts, but either way her youthful mannerisms came out on top. Surprisingly, I kept thinking back to Thandie Newton's take on the character from Demme's film, and marveled at the similarities. Their faces are alike, especially the large eyes to get lost in. Grant and Hepburn really looked like they enjoyed each others company and it helped propel their characters through the intelligent, twist-laden script.When Reggie discovers her husband Charles has been killed and that his accomplices, from an old army booty theft, are looking for his money, she doesn't know who to turn to or who to trust. Everyone she encounters has a hidden agenda or identity, tripping up her plans to find the loot and save herself from her husband's fate. Nothing is as it seems and everyone is in on the ""charade,"" including her deceased spouse, whom it seems she really didn't know at all. Her life has been full of strangers and they are all trying to get to know her now, with hopes of finding the spoils. Among the many men she encounters are top-notch performances from James Coburn, Walter Matthau, and George Kennedy. Coburn and Kennedy are great as the mystery men from Charles' past, causing trouble and just being plain maniacal. The funeral scene, where the two of them are introduced, is hilarious and all involved are pitch-perfect. Matthau also does admirably playing against type, as I'm familiar with him, as a serious character. While his CIA administer Bartholemew has many instances of comic relief, it is his dramatic presence that really surprised me.Charade has it all: mystery, intrigue, romance, confusion, and an abundance of fun humor. Hepburn is radiant and sharp in her delivery, while Grant is comical and yet on a dime turns deathly stone-faced. The script is clever at most times, but never goes overboard to the absurd. I credit the actors and director Donen for steering it with enough reality to make us care for those involved in the plot. Unfortunately, it seems Demme decided to let his actors run loose in his adaptation, causing it to be a farcical retelling, making everything from the original that came close to being too much, fly right over the top. Charade needed to be grounded to succeed and that succeed is exactly what it did.",Charade
79,classicalsteve,"Hitchcock-like Thriller Still Has Its Moments -- Despite Bad Acting and Being Dated , A. Hepburn & Grant Worth the Admission Price",7,17 April 2008,"I have always wondered when 1960's movies started using those rather psychedelic and/or cartoon title intro sequences. And always with the accompaniment of some exotic-inspired music soundtrack with conga drums accompanying lush strings. It came into vogue somewhere in the early 1960's with The Pink Panther, Doris Day films, and other light-hearted action-comedies. Even the original James Bond films jumped on the band-wagon. Charade, a movie NOT directed by Hitchcock, uses the psychedelic opening with the letters of the words dancing around the screen to Latin jazz rhythms which immediately gives away its 1960's roots.The plot is simple enough. Audrey Hepburn's spouse is dispatched and dumped from a train in France before the titles of the movie start dancing around the screen. Turns out he had $250,000 in his possession but the loot has vanished. For a guy worth $100,000's, no one comes to his funeral in Paris except three American baddies, a one-hand trench-coat, a southern red-neck, and an allergic nerd. They didn't come to sob at the funeral. Instead, they each visit Hepburn demanding the dearly departed's money. They threaten to dispatch her they way they did her husband. Of course, she turns out to be a lot more difficult than her husband who appears to have been knocked off without much of a struggle. She then turns to Cary Grant for help, until she discovers he has been lying about who he is. Whom can she trust? And of course, there is Walter Matthau, an American agent (or spy?), who represents the US government's interest in retrieving the money.What saves the movie is the clever banter between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Of course, Grant has the wittiest lines, although Hepburn keeps up with him stride-for-stride, or rather line-for-line. At one point Hepburn points out she is a widow, and Grant replies that so was Juliet at 15. To which Hepburn says ""I am not 15!"" Grant then replies ""Well that's your trouble. You're too old for me."" Grant was almost 60 and Hepburn was 34 when they made this movie.If some of the actors playing the baddies used their footage in this movie as the final exam for an acting class, they would have failed miserably. It's amazing the likes of George Kennedy and James Coburn weren't in the actors' unemployment line after the release of Charade. And some of the writing is also a bit weak, especially Kennedy, replete with prosthetic metal hand, walking around groaning ""Give me the money!"" And James Coburn as a Midwest red-neck called Tex whose lines are little better, if you can distinguish the words through his rough-and-ready rather mediocre attempt at a Texas accent. I doubt whether real Texans could understand what he is saying! You will neither confuse this movie with Film Noir of a couple of decades earlier nor with action movies a couple of decades later. The entire look and feel was born out of a slightly new Hollywood style where filmmakers were trying to give their work a little more pizazz than some of the overly fluffy stuff produced in the 1950's. Action movies were no longer set in dark urban America where lesser-known actors limped into alleyways to avoid their pursuers. Now, they were shot on location all over the world, often in Europe, with the biggest movie stars imaginable. And the experience wouldn't be complete without the innocent sexual innuendo that permeates these films. In Charade, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, the Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig of Hollywood, take the audience on a roller-coaster ride of entertainment masquerading as over-the-top intrigue. It is just pure escapist entertainment, and you'll also breathe a little when you disembark from the roller-coaster. And it is a perfect representative of a bygone era of Hollywood film-making.",Charade
80,jhclues,Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant Sparkle,8,24 September 2001,"As anyone with even a minimum of experience in the real world can attest, life often has a way of taking an unexpected turn that in an instant can turn an uncluttered existence into veritable turmoil, which is exactly what happens in `Charade,' a mystery with romantic and comedic overtones, directed by Stanley Donen and starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant.  An American living in Paris, unaware of her husband's covert activities and associations, Regina `Reggie' Lampert (Hepburn) is informed upon returning home from vacationing at a ski resort that her husband (whom she was about to divorce) has died, having been thrown from a train en route to a destination (unbeknownst to her) that would ultimately have taken him to South America.	Suddenly widowed and without resources, Reggie quickly finds herself surrounded by murder and mystery as the strange secret life of her husband slowly comes to light, and she finds herself the target of some unfinished business that has to do with her husband's clandestine associates.  But as luck would have it, this damsel in distress is befriended by a stranger, Peter Joshua (Grant), a man with whom she had a momentary encounter during her vacation at the resort.  Together, they attempt to assemble the pieces of the discomfiting puzzle that has become her life, in order to get her back on track.  It's a tall order, however, and like the man said at one time or another, `Nobody said life was going to be easy.'  Along the way Reggie also discovers some things about her knight in shining armor that adds yet another perspective to the conundrum into which she has inexplicably fallen.  And she begins to wonder if anything in the world is actually the way it seems.	Working from an excellent screenplay by Peter Stone, and backed by a terrific score and that familiar theme by Henry Mancini, Donen invades Hitchcock territory to weave a web of intrigue and suspense that, while it lacks the nuance and that special touch that Hitchcock always managed to bring to this kind of material, will keep you guessing until the very end. The overall film has a decided `60s Cinema' look and feel that virtually defines it, and while this isn't a bad thing, the presentation as such has a way of keeping the viewer at arm's length and prevents the kind of emotional involvement that would've made this a riveting film.  Suffice to say that, comparatively, it lacks the realism that you find in more recent offerings of this genre.  What it definitely has in it's favor is the great cast, and especially the stars, Hepburn and Grant.	Audrey Hepburn is lovely as Reggie, bringing a knowing, yet innocent quality to the character.  Charismatic as always, and imbued with that natural, refined beauty that is her trademark, she epitomizes the sensibilities of the era with a waif-like consistency and bearing that makes her a joy to watch.  She has a radiant screen presence, and seeing her in this place and time makes it easy to understand all of the things that truly made her a movie star as well as an accomplished actor. 
	Grant, of course, is charming as usual, slipping into his character with facility and creating an instant chemistry with Hepburn that makes this story come alive.  His performance is smooth and believable, and his easy, yet commanding presence leaves no doubt that he is in control, even when faced with some formidable opponents and situations.  He conveys something of an invincibility in this role that lets you know that no matter how dark things get, all will be well by the end.  After all the twists and turns, you feel relatively certain that if they stick together, Reggie and Peter are going to land on their feet.  But then again, this is a `Charade,' isn't it?	The supporting cast includes James Coburn (Tex), Walter Matthau (Bartholomew), George Kennedy (Herman), Dominique Minot (Sylvie), Ned Glass (Leopold), Jacques Marin (Inspector Grandpierre), Paul Bonifas (Mr. Felix) and Thomas Chelimsky (Jean-Louis).  An entertaining film that has a place of it's own in Cinematic History, `Charade' affords the opportunity of seeing two of the giants of the silver screen together, doing what they do best: Making magic.  Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are stars of rare magnitude, and together they make the screen sparkle.  And it's no charade.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",Charade
81,SanteeFats,Excellent,10,10 March 2014,"Suspense movies don't get any better than this one. A great cast lead by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn with an excellent supporting cast. Hepburn is married to a man who turns out to be a thief from WWII. Along with four other OSS agents that were suppose to deliver $250K in gold to the French underground. They buried it instead and reported it stolen by the Nazi's during an ambush. Hepburn's husband doesn't wait for the rest but steals it first. So the remaining three show up after her husband is murdered trying to leave. There are only three left because Grant's brother (?) was one of the five but he is dead. There is some nice word play about spies/agents between Matthau (supposedly a CIA desk jockey) and Hepburn. Grant is superb as the suave, urbane, witty, older man to the rescue or is he?? There appears to be another player in the game as the three OSS thieves start getting killed off one by one. Turns out there is no brother, Grant confesses he is actually a thief (or is he?) and is trying for the gold also. Every time Grant is caught in one of his lies about his name and who or what he is/does he comes up with another name and occupation. Since this film was made in 1963 it only follows that the Hepburn must fall for the much older Grant but he does a role reversal and plays hard to get. Things start coming to a head as the nears it's end, of course it has too after all. It seems that the gold got converted into three very valuable stamps and are hidden on an envelope. This has been given to Hepburn's nephew and he trades them to a stamp collector for a whole bunch of worthless stamps. This guy turn out to be a rare thing, an honest man. He gives the stamps back to her. Thinking Grant is the killer and is now after her she calls Matthau and they are to meet. Grant and her pass in the hotel. He follows her to the train station where she ends up calling the US embassy. Here is where we find out that it has been Matthau all along who is the real bad guy. He is the fifth man that was left behind to die and is the killer and is now after the stamps. So now there is the chase scene only it is on foot. The chase ends up in an empty theater. There is a clever ending in the theater when Grant drops Matthau through a trap door ending his involvement. At the very end Grant is a treasury agent and has been trying to recover the loot. The two of them go off into the future to get married and live happily ever after.",Charade
82,Stampsfightclub,classy romantic thriller,8,30 December 2006,"Having never seen a film with Hepburn (My fair Lady) in before I was very excited about watching this film after her many praises and after watching the opening sequence in the Ski hotel I was immediately hooked.Hepburn stars as Reg Lampert, a sophisticated woman unaware of her husband's life. When hearing of his death she is left with a sum of money, only she doesn't know where it is. What she does know is that many men want it, and they are going to track her down to get it themselves.Conforming brilliantly to a thriller genre, Charade presents a somewhat light-hearted entertainment for the family through the use of a diverse set of characters and their own humour and antics. It's slow at points to allow audiences to become familiar with the characters but when necessary, for example the ending, it becomes fast and tense.Relationships between characters are great, especially between Grant (Monkey Business) and Hepburn who are simply terrific as they try to weigh each other out. Grant's character is very cool and classy and made me pay particular close attention to his actions in the film.The mystery behind this story is great. Audiences are always wondering who has the money and why and through many scenes involving close confrontation between each the film is always exciting and expecting.A few scenes had me put of where the whole plot seemed to easy and not realistic context wise. However it is minimal criticism for a film that is simply entertaining and engaging throughout.Hepburn's character has become one of my all time favourites.

With a central plot/love story hinging on the relationship between the Grant and Hepburn characters. And...this is where Charade succeeds greatly as the chemistry between the two is strong, thanks to the smart, forward-thinking idea of having Hepburn as on top of her game as Grant is of his. She is no ""damsel in distress"", but rather a worthy sparring partner for Grants (and the other mugs).Of course, it doesn't hurt that Hepburn is dressed - impeccably - by Edith Head in stunning Givenchy outfits all set to the music of Henry Mancini.Speaking of mugs, they don't get more character-y to look at than Matthau, Coburn, Kennedy and Glass and they all are terrific in their roles as shadowy, sinister figures who are after something that they think Hepburn has...but she just might not have it.Beautifully shot by Donen in Paris of the early 1960's, this film captures a bygone era and a real feeling of a romanticized and glamorous Europe. This is interesting characters doing interesting things in an interesting way in an interesting place.And...I'm glad all of this is interesting, for if you stopped for a moment to think about the plot - or the rather languid pace of this film - then Charade would lose quite a bit of it's luster and appeal.But, fortunately for me, I didn't do that. I sat and immersed myself in these characters, settings and circumstances and was rewarded with a very entertaining evening brought to the screen by master players who know what they are doing.Letter Grade: A-8 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Charade

Audrey Hepburn is Reggie Lambert, an American girl married to a swiss guy called Charles Lambert (at least that's what she thinks)... She's spending her holidays in some ski resort with her best girlfriend Sylvie and the son of hers. Reggie has decided to divorce her husband, so she gets back to Paris. Once there she found out that her husband's been killed. From this moment on she gets involved in the funniest spy plot ever.Watching Charade you'll have an smile on your face from the beginning till the very end. And you'll burst out laughing in many moments of the movie. Stanley Donen gets out of every sequence very skillfully and, as he did before in Seven Brides or Singin' In The Rain, he probes he's an outstanding filmmaker. There're two names that come into my mind every time I watch this movie: Alfred Hitchcock and Blake Edwards. In Charade, Stanley Donen merged suspense and romantic-comedy in the best possible way. Actor's selection is just perfect, the chemical between Hepburn and Grant is simply unbeatable. One more perfect couple to add to Hollywood's Couple's Hall Of Fame: side by side with Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn-Cary Grant (him once again!), Lauren Bacall-Humphrey Bogart... It's not easy to find two actors so compatible. What to say about George Kennedy or James Coburn? Best known for their roles in action movies, they do their best as CIA agents. And least but not less, we got Walter Matthau, one of the best comedy actors ever (I should've put Walter Matthau-Jack Lemon in my Couple's Hall Of Fame!) doing the best he can (that is a lot!) as (in principle) an American Embassy employee. So if you liked North By Northwest or Breakfast At Tiffany's, if you think that there's never been a more classy actress than Audrey Hepburn, if you do believe that Cary Grant's been one of the more talented actors ever (and one of the funniest ones)... please, don't miss Charade.

As another commenter has noted, this is quintessentially a Hitchcock film -- and I feel confident it would have been significantly better if Hitchcock had made it. But the romantic pairing of Hepburn and Grant transforms this otherwise commonplace thriller into something magical. There may have been better or prettier actresses than Audrey, and there may have been better (though not handsomer) actors than Cary -- but no two actors ever exuded sophistication and playfulness the way these two do, and they play off one another in this movie with extraordinary charm and electricity. It is truly a pity that they never made another movie together because it would also have been a classic. I don't believe Hepburn ever had another leading man or Grant another leading lady as perfect as these two are together. And the story is sufficiently tense and amusing to make reasonable use of the time when Hepburn and Grant aren't on the screen together. The film also brings together three later stars -- Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and George Kennedy -- as foils for Hepburn and Grant. But it is THEIR movie all the way!

She was a big star at this time and had already appeared in ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" - her iconic performance. This film finds her in a role that is not that impressive nor character-heavy. She portrays Regina Lampert the wife of a husband who is killed as the film opens. As an investigation ensues, she discovers that her husband, who was fabulously wealthy, had stolen money from the American government and had been a CIA man. Walter Matthau portrays Hamilton Bartholomew, who is supposedly on her side and whom she trusts. Regina discovers that three men are after the money her husband left and have threatened to kill her, thinking she is in possession of the money. Cary Grant's character is a man with many names who is also lying to Regina and whom we mistakenly believe is also after her money. Deception, lies, murder, CIA, are all elements in this mystery thriller which also pretends to be a romance. Cary Grant, no longer the young and handsome talent he had once been, is still charming and very funny. But the romance element is hardly the focus in this film. For fans of movies of Audrey Hepburn, you'll find that this one is not entirely romantic and some parts appear to have been inspired by the popular ""pulp fiction"" movies of the time. At times, owing to the music by Henry Mancini such as the opening credits music, the film has the feel of a James Bond movie. Add to that a girl running for her life, three dangerous men (one with a hook for a hand) and Cary Grant's debonair role and you do feel this is a James Bond movie. But what we have here is a mix of romantic comedy and thriller, almost as if it is poking fun of the thriller and mystery genre. I've loved Audrey Hepburn movies in the past and she is clearly comfortable in various types of films but this one is too much of an attempt to appear in a genre that is not suited to her. The best performances here are neither Grant and Hepburn who try to do romantic comedy in an otherwise bleak murder setting. Walter Matthau is a two-faced guy, who does it without even looking truly murderous, is the strongest performance, followed by James Coburn and George Kennedy. Filmed on location in Paris, with Charles Lang's usually excellent cinematography, and Givenchy's beautiful and chic wardrobes, this is a movie that is good and at the same time bad. I didn't care for the script and the comedy, considered old fashioned and early 60's inside jokes, can be lost to modern audiences. At times you don't know what this movie is trying to be. It's not the type of romance Hepburn did in ""Funny Face"" or ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"". It's Audrey Hepburn doing a film with mystery and thriller elements which was becoming more and more popular throughout the 60's. The romantic comedy elements are written into the dialogue mostly. Certain scenes are very ""60's"". For instance, the nightclub ""orange"" game in which couples pass an orange using their bodies and not using their hands has strong sexual innuendo, a sign of the more sexually liberated times of the 60's.

93,silverscreen888,A Fascinating and Very Pleasing Romantic Noir Mystery; Delightful,8,24 June 2005,"Henry Mancini's music and the lyrical title song are not the only virtues of the attractive production of ""Charade"". Stanley Donen, probably the best Alfred Hitchcock school-of director in the twentieth century, also mounted a film featuring beautiful sets, lovely costumes, very fine lighting, sound, cinematography and mush more. And the camera-work and blocking of the actors is extraordinary. But the strongest feature of the film is is intricate and logical storyline. The mysterious death of a young woman's husband makes her the target here of a trio of frightening types. She somehow enlists an enigmatic but attractive man she has met, who signs on to help her. But he proves to be as delusive, have as many false names and be more worrisome than was her mysterious husband, about whom she knew nothing. The four, along with her husband part of an army quartet that had stolen something valuable in WWII, want the item which her husband had stolen. The wife enlists a man from the American Embassy also; but she and the mystery man have to evade the nefarious trio, and try to trust one another; and finally she has to decide if the mystery man or the Embassy man is a killer, and which one will save her life and return the stolen item. Cary Grant does very well, despite being a bit too old to play the mystery man. Walter Matthau is effective as the Embassy man. The three villains are played energetically by James Coburn, intelligent Ned Glass and powerful George Kennedy, with a hook for a hand. There are wonderfully memorable scenes in the film such as a frightening first meeting with the bad trio in the funeral home where her husband is lying; a fight between Grant and Kennedy on the roof; a trip on a barge down the Seine; a hunt for the lost treasure; and a final confrontation in an empty theater. The slow growth of the romance between a reluctant-but-interested Grant and an eager by hesitant Audrey Hepburn as the bewildered wife works very well. This is a fine noir film, very colorful, and with tons of interesting and humorous dialogue. Highly recommended, and almost as good as its reputation says.",Charade
94,skepticskeptical,Comedic murder mystery,6,5 October 2014,"Cary Grant is looking wizened and leathery in this 1963 film. By this point in his life, he has clearly spent too much time at tanning salons. His less-than-dashing appearance is accentuated (exacerbated?) by the much younger, cream-colored and waif-like Audrey Hepburn, who however throws herself at Grant's fatherly figure at every available opportunity--that is, whenever she is not eating something. One can only wonder whether she has an extremely overactive thyroid or is perhaps bulimic, given how thin she is, despite eating constantly throughout the film. The story is amusing and lightly entertaining. It's a comedic murder mystery caper whose primary intention appears to be to stoke Cary Grant's ego. Charade was fun to watch, despite my issues with the Audrey Hepburn character, who does not seem to have much of an identity and seeks only to endear herself to the duplicitous Cary Grant character for reasons which remain inscrutable. The film would have been better in black and white, aesthetically speaking. Overall, I'd say that this production is a far cry from Notorious, where a younger Grant becomes romantically entangled with Ingrid Bergman with some similar dynamics in play. Notorious is a film worth watching over and over again. Charade is not.",Charade
95,bigverybadtom,Overdone,5,20 March 2016,"This is supposed to be a Hitchcockian-style thriller mixed with comedy and romance. But it never really succeeds in any category.Audrey Hepburn plays Reggie, an American living in Paris married to a Swiss husband she now wants to divorce because she doesn't love him and he has been too dishonest. But when she admits this to a female friend of hers, the husband has already been murdered, and he had already sold all their furniture and had tickets to leave for Venezuela. On top of that, three men are threatening her, demanding a fortune in $250,000 that she supposedly has-but she doesn't. She is contacted by a man in the American Embassy who tells her the story about how, during World War Two, some OSS agents were supposed to have delivered that money to the French Resistance but instead stole it. On top of that, another man meets her, knowing what is going on, and Reggie is unsure if he is a friend-or foe.Reggie has a sort of romance with this man, despite his own dishonesty over who he is and what his name is. There are also ridiculous scenes such as his taking a shower with his clothes on, and so much running back and forth that it gets tedious. The characters are undeveloped, the romance doesn't work, and there are too few laughs for a comedy. Nice try, but it just didn't work.",Charade

97,dave13-1,Nice!,8,5 January 2012,"Here, director Stanley Donen not only weaves together the usual Hitchcock suspense thriller elements - a man (or in this case a couple) on the run from ruthless villains, crackling situation comedy dialogue and a romantic subplot that plays out between all of the runnings about - he actually sneaks in all kinds of trademark Hitchcock visual devices to thrill audiences familiar with the master's work. Hitchcock loved to exploit the audience's fear of heights, for instance, and darned if people in this film aren't standing on ledges and looking over railings etc. The locale is, of course, a foreign one, Paris in this case. And Hitchcock regular Cary Grant is here too, with ultra-chic Audrey Hepburn along and fitting the Continental setting perfectly as she so often did. The 'McGuffin', the device that gets the plot rolling, turns out to be some missing money that a criminal gang assume Audrey has in her possession. Cary comes to her rescue. Or is he working his own angle on her? Her suspicions play beautifully off her developing romantic interest, just as every other element in the film fits together seamlessly. The jokes all work, the thrills thrill, the fast paced segments really move, and Audrey and Cary have fabulous romantic and comedic chemistry together. The production design is gorgeous and posh- looking, yet filled with menacing shadows and glaring lights - more of Hitch's visual devices - and Audrey looks suitably lovely in her trademark Givenchy outfits. And it's not all just a trifling style-piece either. The spy-thriller business at the plot's center, without giving too much away, is logical and compelling. When the movie is over, a viewer is conscious of having had an entirely satisfactory entertainment experience. Unfortunately, this was a one-shot for Cary, Audrey and Stanley. With all of the silly spy nonsense that came out in the mid- 60s, I would love to have seen this group team up for another go.",Charade

Audrey Hepburn was so pathetic and unbelievable and just overdone. Gary Grant was also a mess and his character(s) were just retarded to all capacity.Audrey Hepburn's character takes women back to the early quarter of the century - turning them into helpless lovelorn suckers for a man. The Paris location had nothing to do with the film, the rest of the story blends into something so horrible and the action is barely existent. It's just horrible on so many levels.There is one magical piece in here - it's the setting under the stage floor - which is a real masterpiece in the entire film - quite unique in the entire film era of the 60's and to some degree - even 40 something years later.Aside of that fantastic little segment, this movie is a dismal mark on cinematic history.",Charade
99,Eumenides_0,Hollywood At Its Best,10,14 July 2009,"For me Charade symbolizes everything good about old Hollywood movies: the stars, the luxurious sets, the intelligent dialogue, the twistful plot, the humor and suspense and fast-paced action that made them so entertaining.Audrey Hepburn plays Regina ""Reggie"" Lambert, an American living in Paris. She has an unhappy marriage with Charlie, a man she doesn't know very well. So she decides to divorce her. But before she does, he's conveniently assassinated. And so begins one of the greatest cat-and-mouse games in the history of cinema, as war criminals, CIA agents and Reggie not only try to find the killer but also the $250,000 the dead man was supposed to have on him.With beautiful Paris as the backdrop, it's inevitable that this thriller become a romantic movie, and there's no one better for Hepburn to fall in love with than the great Cary Grant. Their relationship is witty, heartfelt and enjoyable to watch on the screen. He plays an American who conveniently meets Reggie in her moment of crisis, but as the movie progresses his role changes many times until we're not sure who he really is.Twistful as the plot may be, it's also a lovely comedy, poking fun at the crime and thriller genres, with amazing inventions and situations for the characters to get out of. Peter Stone deserves all praise for his inspired screenplay. I live for movies like this, that mix a good dose of light-hearted fun with the best aspects of thrillers. This is the equivalent of a good Agatha Christie mystery. They just don't make movies like this anymore.With a cool cast that includes George Kennedy, Walter Mathau and James Coburn, Charade is a suspenseful movie that lives up to its title: you'll be guessing throughout the movie the truth about everything you're watching until the satisfying and logical conclusion.

101,garethcrook,Classic twister,7,7 February 2021,"I've never seen Charade before, this seems like a glaring omission in my cinematic education. Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, I could go on. Henri Mancini provides the score over a gloriously 60s infused opening sequence, that introduces Regina Lampert (Hepburn) and Peter Joshua (Grant) in all their effortless cinematic glory. We just don't put stars like this on screen anymore. Their opening exchange is fast, funny and fabulous. Regina is a wealthy woman thanks to her husband who she's planning to divorce. Before she gets chance, he turns up dead in Paris where they live, having unbeknownst to her, sold all their possessions for a quarter million in auction while Regina was away skiing and chatting to Peter. He was planning to scarper to South America, but never made it. Despite, we find out, owning 4 passports with different identities. We have ourselves a mystery! One that kicks into gear at the deceased sparsely attended funeral, as a string of unusual characters come to pay their respects... and check that Charles is dead. Despite the obvious cloak and dagger direction we're headed, the one liners are relentless. It's a lot funnier than you'd expect something like this to be. Enter the excellently named Hamilton Bartholomew (Matthau) with that killer wry smile. He says he's a ""CIA Desk Jockey"" and dishes all the dirt. Producing a photo of Charles with his mates Tex, Herman & Leo in uniform who all want the quarter mil... as does Bartholomew. To be honest I'd already spotted the clue as to where the money is in the opening 10 minutes, I've clearly watched too many films. But anyway Regina is tasked trying to find the money she's completely in the dark about. She needs help, she needs Peter. Only because this is the 60s and ""(A)young woman can't handle (this) by herself"". Their double act works though, but not in the suave elegant leading man, leading lady sort of way. There's not really any chemistry, despite Grant being dashing and Hepburn being vivacious. Comedically though they click. Now I'm a little loathed to divulge too many of the twists, but suffice to say there are many and most of the players have a trick up their sleeve, especially Herman (George Kennedy) who has a steel mechanical claw like something from a Bond movie. No one is quite what they seem and this deftly dances around with characters dodging, double crossing and generally pulling the wool over each other and our eyes. It's a lot of fun. It lacks the style that Grant delivered with Hitchcock in North By Northwest, but it's definitely singing from the Hitch playbook. Despite its tone of slapstick, it does the menace and mystery of espionage well too, not least with Herman and his claw. It's a really odd mix though and I'm not sure how I feel about watching Cary Grant shower in a suit or Walter Matthau doing squats on the telephone. Essentially we've an hour of smoke, mirrors and messing around, book ended with a great half hour either side. Everyone is great, looks great. It's cut well and uses its Parisian location beautifully. Mancini's music is gorgeous, it's a lovely piece of cinema. A classic. I didn't grip me though as I'd expect it might, but although the twists become glaringly obvious I did still really enjoy it.",Charade

It is funny, exciting and scary and a genuine thriller with so many twists and turns, it bewilders one on first viewing. But the film is good enough to see again and again. Kennedy,Coburn and Glass make terrific villains - funny but truly menacing at the same time. The musical score is sublime and adds to the movie. Matthau is great as a CIA agent and one is kept guessing about Grant's character. A truly brilliant concept which rewards the viewer who can give it their full concentration.",Charade

There are a lot of twists and turns that hold you to your seat and make you wonder what exactly is going on – and who is really who. It is basically a comedy mystery-thriller with a good mix of stars; suspenseful, with some comic dialogue and interludes. There is a reasonably good resolution at the end. That being said, it just goes on – for me anyway – a little too long. The meandering relationship between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn does become strained and repetitive. Some scenes could have been shortened or simply edited out – like that overly long boat ride on the Seine that was suppose to be romantic, but dissolved to schmaltzy. The pace of this movie was too uneven for me to give it a stronger rating.",Charade

Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead.She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government.At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept.The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau?

110,majikstl,The Truth about Charade,9,24 April 2004,"When Audrey Hepburn says to Cary Grant in 1963's CHARADE ""You know what's wrong with you?...Absolutely nothing!"", it is a great line because everyone watching knows that she is really talking about Cary Grant, not the character he is playing. When Thandie Newton says to Mark Wahlberg in THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE ""You know what's wrong with you?...Absolutely nothing!"", it is a relatively meaningless piece of dialogue, because, even though Wahlberg is apparently a nice guy and pretty good actor, he is no Cary Grant, and his character has done nothing to garner such praise. But then again, Newton is no Hepburn. And CHARLIE is certainly no CHARADE.CHARADE is one of the most pleasing pieces of fluff that Hollywood has ever made. Despite a notable body count and a few suspenseful moments, the film is really a romantic comedy. Despite its intricate plot of double crosses, fake identities and a mad search for some missing loot in a picture-postcard Paris, it is designed to amuse. It is Hitchcock-lite; as directed by Stanley Donen, a man best known for directing films like SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, the film also is constructed like a musical, stringing together a few remarkable set pieces with a silly plot and clever banter. But most of all, CHARADE is an excuse to pair up Grant and Hepburn, two experts in the field of romantic comedy. If ever a film were personality driven it is CHARADE, which sports not just pros Grant and Hepburn, but a batch of gifted character actors such as Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass. Nobody would ever mistake CHARADE for great filmmaking, but as sprightly comedy tinged with dark humor it is hard to beat.But for some inexplicable reason it was remade in 2002 as the rather blandly named THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. I can only assume that the filmmakers realized that there was no way they could equal the wit and style of the original -- not to mention the difficulty in finding contemporary stars comparable to Hepburn and Grant -- so they opted to play the film more or less straight. That may have made sense if the plot of the original was anything to be taken seriously. But remaking a comedy-thriller as just a thriller and stripping it of its Hollywood gloss for a gritty realistic look really does not make a lot of sense. Add to that some ill-conceived politically correct updating -- a dash of lesbianism, a bit of feminism (the police detective is now a woman) and a multiethnic cast -- and the style and the content of the film seem mismatched. Jonathan Demme, a director who once showed a knack for making light and quirky comedies like HANDLE WITH CARE and MELVIN AND HOWARD, now makes mostly dark and dreary dramas like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. He has become a ""serious"" filmmaker in the worst sense of the word.The film might still have been above average with proper casting, but the best that can be said for Wahlberg and Newton is that they are okay, but they never come off as a romantic couple. Certainly the sparkling chemistry of Grant and Hepburn is missing, but then the film never even tried for that tone in the first place. Only Tim Robbins, taking on the Walter Matthau role, seems to remember that the source material for the film was a comedy.As is, CHARLIE is a perfectly competent and perfectly forgettable little thriller. But that is not enough to make it anything more than just a dour stepchild of a minor classic.",Charade

This is one of those early Sixties films where the plot (money stolen by Hepburn's murdered husband is sought by a variety of dubious characters) was viewed as adult sophistication for a discerning audience but in retrospect is really contrived and stupid, with absolutely no plausibility. At least it works as a framework for the spontaneous and intimate interplay between Hepburn and Grant, who seem so smitten with each other that they're happy to digress from Peter Stone's meaningless screenplay to flirt heavily. (At one point, Hepburn hilariously interrupts Grant to ask how he manages to shave his cleft chin.) The score by Henry Mancini, including the now-famous title song (with lyrics by Johnny Mercer), is actually pretty good--dark, mature jazz that's more memorable than Donen's disinterested direction, a minor effort from a worthwhile filmmaker.",Charade

That is what's for sale in Stanley Donen's screwball, romantic mystery film, Charade, which trades in A-list charisma for our viewing pleasure. Coming just one year after Sean Connery wooed the world with his characterisation of James Bond, this cheerful outing, with themes of murder, theft and deceit, has the initial feel of Terence Young's iconic 007 debut, in its colourful, yet cartoon-ish opening credits sequence.Henry Mancini's music helps in setting an early mischievous tone that reverberates throughout the entire film. Audrey Hepburn is introduced, framed in a suitably beautiful looking ski resort, with an enjoyably playful early scene between herself and Cary Grant. It's a sharp, funny scene that assures a certain comical impetus.After this, the main thrust of the plot kicks in, which rotates around a web of secret identities and bubbly flirtatiousness. The film does occasionally cross genres over to being that of a thriller. One rooftop fight scene between Cary Grant and the ever burly George Kennedy, could easily be mistaken for one of 007's more exciting exploits. Furthermore, there are some surprisingly visual glimpses of the aftermath of murder, which given the established, lighter tone, might catch you off guard.The real draw here though, is the repartee between Hepburn and Grant. As Regina Lampert, Hepburn carries over her kooky charm from Breakfast at Tiffany's, with another quick witted display that see's the film through some of its more silly, screwball sections. Likewise, Cary Grant, although reportedly insecure about the age difference between himself and his co-star on set, cuts a relaxed presence, making for some delightful interplay between the actors.Charade is pure, old school Hollywood charm. If anything, the plot is little more than a vehicle for the fun and games that Hepburn and Grant enjoy. If you try and see it as anything other than a little bit of light fun, you've got yourself a case of mistaken identity.",Charade
115,tcchelsey,A REAL HOLLYWOOD STORY TO TELL!,10,4 February 2021,"Stanley Donen, the legendary musical director, grew up watching the likes of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but he admitted later in his career that he was also a devotee of Hitchcock. It took awhile, granted, but he got his chance, which also marked the only teaming of Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. Donen said that it would be difficult to turn down any movie with these headliners, however, mastering the technique of Hitch was another story. Donen will always be credited for having an eye for detail and he went straight to work on this project, capturing that black comedy slash edge of your seat genius Hitchcock so well projected in his films and he nailed it. Easier said than done. There was also another stumbling block, as CHARADE was released not too long after the death of President Kennedy, so he had to be most careful of any references to assassinations, and what to do with a story of a bunch of no-gooders who specialized in murder! Careful, now! It all worked out, because audiences were especially interested in the chemistry between Hepburn and Grant and what a dynamic team they made, if for only one film! Best of their scenes together are just watching Grant's comedic expressions, which are knock-down, drag-out hilarious. He truly was a master of comedy and Donen, a master himself, knew how to put this actor to work, if not just let the camera roll. The nightclub wiggle and jiggle scene, without giving too much away, is now legend, again crediting Grant's looks of utter surprise! And as for the baddies, notably George Kennedy, he truly comes off as a member of the Hitchcockian troop of villains, ALSO Ned Glass, who was in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, which was Donen's favorite mystery. Last but not least, a nod to Walter Matthau, himself a scene stealer like Grant, who most definitely keeps your attention and then some! Simply said, one of the great movies of all time and it goes by fast, and kind of sad in retrospect that Grant and Hepburn never returned together. But at least we have this one to cherish for many years to come and to attract a new generation of fans, that without a doubt. Thank you, Mr. Donen.",Charade

117,hemisphere65-1,"No thrills, comedy, or romance.",2,17 May 2021,"Pretty good story, but not a very good movie. The acting by the two leads is unconvincing, to say the least.

There supposed instant romance is about as believable as Stewart and Novak in Vertigo.Another disappointing ""classic"" film.",Charade
118,ragosaal,"Perfect Mix of Mystery , Romance and Light Humor",8,20 October 2006,"""Charade"" is a wonderful and most enjoyable film. With a plot that includes mysterious murders as a background it has a romantic story and humor too.Action takes place in Paris and Stanley Donnen's direction achieves a most entertaining product aided by a very good cast with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn in the leading roles. Hepburn gives a very good performance as the menaced widow that doesn't know why she is being menaced (at first at least). Cary Grant is as good and convincing as usual as the man that tries to help her and while at it they fall in love; though Grant was much older than Hepburn and this worried him a lot when they told him who the leading lady would be (in fact he tried Hepburn to be replaced), the difference doesn't really notice on the screen and they show a real chemistry between them that makes them a good match.The rest of the cast is most accurate. Walter Matthau is at his best as a member of the American legacy that also gets involved in the case. George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass are the villains that threaten Hepburn.If not regarding Grant and Hepburn's future, the ending of the film doesn't lack a surprising twist regarding the mysterious murders and the solution of the plot.An excellent film most complete and enjoyable as a thriller, a light comedy or a romantic film. Make your choice.",Charade
119,filmalamosa,Excellent,10,29 December 2011,The other reviews cover the film am just adding things that struck me.Hitchcock like only with the humor of Cary Grant intact. This is the kind of movie that keeps your interest through out.Audrey Hepburn is at her best... although having her eat all the time is ironic with her anorexia. Cary Grant delivers his classic persona intact.I usually like foreign films to take me as far away from my current situation as possible but time travel is another method. In movies made before 1965 the women still wore skirts and heels but much more important the Politically Correct stuff was a magnitude more innocent.Good movie watch it!,Charade
120,Catharina_Sweden,A wonderful bagatelle,8,16 January 2014,"This movie is a wonderful ""bagatelle"", as the French would say. The story itself is quite silly and very unrealistic - there are too many holes in it. Just to mention two of them: even if you are not a philatelist, you would not miss that the stamps on a new letter are a) very old and b) from different countries. At least the police, trained to notice details, ought to have seen it. And how could Regina, when she was all out of money and all her wardrobes empty in the flat, still wear a new very expensive coat every time she goes outside..? But one does not care about these flaws, because when one watches a movie with either Cary Grant or Audrey Hepburn, the main reason is that one wants to see THEM! He still so incredibly handsome and desirable there at age 59, and she so lithe and beautiful, and them both so elegant in their perfect clothes and hair-styles... The dialogue is witty most of the time (but sometimes silly), and one also gets to see a bit of Paris. This is elegance for all times!",Charade
121,antagonist117,"Timeless entertainment, and a career high for Hepburn and Grant",10,20 June 2013,"Charade is in a genre of its own: the romantic caper comedy thriller. The colors and shapes of the title sequence belong unmistakably to the early 1960s, as do the characters' clothes, hairstyles, and speech mannerisms. Yet over 50 years after its release the humor is still fresh, the twists still surprise, and Audrey and Cary are still the epitome of cool. The supporting actors, especially Walter Matthau and James Coburn, give the movie a sharp edge and high stakes. It is no hyperbole to say that Charade is one of the most purely entertaining films of all time. It is also arguably the best film that either Hepburn or Grant made during their long and very successful careers.",Charade

123,adventure-21903,Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn: Class Defined,9,22 March 2020,"Cary Grant made 5 of his last 6 films at Universal*. The studio gave him free reign and he cast his films perfectly. In Charade Cary Grant brought in Stanley Donen who was one of the classiest Directors of his era. For supporting players Cary Grant brought in James Coburn and the peerless Walter Matthau. Universal gave Grant a lot of perks including a star bungalow on the Universal lot. Ron Hudson who made millions for Universal also had a Bungalow.Topping off Cary Grant cast as his love interest Audrey Hepburn. I could go on for hours about Hepburn but to sum up: Audrey Hepburn was a Lady who was a great actress who was the most glamorous well dressed star of her era.This pic is set in glamorous Paris and the suspense works well. With these stars one becomes immediately entranced in the story.The likes of Grant, Hepburn and Matthau do not exist on today's Hollywood.Audrey died far too young. Audrey Hepburn was and still is the only woman who could wear a polka dot top and a stripe bottom at the Oscars as a presenter and get a standing ovation.* Cary Grant's last picture was Walk Don't Run at Columbia with Jim Hutton in the Joel McCrea role and Samantha Eggar in the Jean Arthur rookie, and Grant in the Charles Coburn role.",Charade

I did, and usually i prefer to check movies i haven't seen but...well this is a very good film. it doesn't have higher purposes than pure entertainment, neither is a big character story or it has a very deep story, but it's witty, it has charm and fun. and it's actually very well written.the biggest compliment i can give to this is saying that without the best part of the film - the chemistry between hepburn and grant (he's kinda a george clooney of his times probably a better actor, even though i like clooney) is fanastic - it would still work. because the cript has a lot of twists and turns and we can't trust anyone throughout the whole movie.it is full of surprises that makes us keep on guessing until its end. it's that type of film that works on any time and age because...well it's not about anything in particular. it's a thrill ride without historical context of any sorts. usually i would give a lower grade to films that ""can't"" be anything else besides entertainment. but this is higher value type of entertainment. it's like a very well carved marble that never gets boring and it's always on the move.this is one of the best movie ever without having a lot of meaings besides wanting the viewers to have fun. is a great great example of a romcom/action/con/ a film that subverts its genres whie it wants mostly to be a very well told story. if you want a film solely for passing a good time while being impressed how well is conceived exactly for that, this is the film. it's a really good ride that should be considered a true classic. it is.",Charade
125,Hancock_the_Superb,"Classy, endlessly entertaining thriller",9,2 December 2007,"Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) is a young American woman on vacation in Paris, whose marriage to her husband Charlie is about to unravel. The situation is solved quite unexpectedly when Charlie is murdered, and almost instantly Regina realizes that something sinister is going on. During WWII her husband had been a member of the OSS who had stolen a shipment of Nazi gold along with several others, and now the surviving gang members (James Coburn, George Kennedy, Ned Glass) are willing to kill Reggie to get it back. Bewildered, frightened, but always with ready with a snappy comeback, Reggie holds her own, but must rely on a seemingly upright CIA Agent (Walter Matthau) and a man whose name, identity, and allegiance seems to change at every turn (Cary Grant) to find the money and avoid a grisly fate at the hands of the criminals.""Charade"" is a borderline impossible film to classify. The plot description makes it seem like a rather straightforward Hitchcockian thriller: an individual trapped in circumstances they don't understand, protagonists who can't be fully trusted, menacing bad guys, and a rather ingenious Macguffin. But the movie also works as a wonderful romantic comedy, with an extremely witty script and two old-school Hollywood romantic leads. That the film works as both is a testament to its status as a classic. It may not be the smartest or most inventive film of all time, but it's certainly one of the most entertaining.The main attraction of the film is undoubtedly the two leads. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant were both stars of classic Hollywood, and both were entering the later stages of their careers. Audrey Hepburn is simply one of the greats. She aged incredibly well on film, maintaining the class and lovable straightforwardness from her earlier films, and adding to it a degree of sophistication and wit as she grew older. Audrey's charm is undeniable; even in her lesser works like ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", it's almost impossible to dislike Audrey. In ""Charade"" she is as beautiful as ever, dressed in a gorgeous array of Givenchy dresses, and carries herself with her trademark class and dignity. If anything she's more appealing in this film than in ""Roman Holiday"" or ""Sabrina"".On the other end is Cary Grant, one of Hollywood's greatest leading men, nearing the end of his career. His character is never who he seems; his identity and name change every other scene or so. You WANT to think that he's a good guy, I mean he IS Cary Grant, and he IS flirting with Audrey Hepburn. But when Reggie sees him conspiring with the three villains, when he gives himself a different name in every scene, how can you be sure? The film somehow manages to pull this character off without it being laughable or predictable, and I think Grant is to be credited for this. He and Hepburn have great chemistry and are helped by a witty script with an endless stream of verbal bantering, which together makes their rather large age difference superfluous. Nowadays, these two actors playing these characters would be decried for ""typecasting"" or ""lack of range"", but when something works, particularly as well as in a film like this... who cares?The film makes brilliant use of gorgeous Paris scenery throughout, and features marvelous set pieces, most notably a roof-top fight between Grant and Kennedy's characters and the lengthy chase sequence/shootout at the climax. Peter Stone's fine screenplay deserves credit for somehow managing to amalgamate the comedy and thriller aspects and keep the viewer guessing as to who the bad guy is. Charles Lang's cinematography captures both the beauty of Paris and also adds a touch of darkness appropriate to the story. Stanley Donen's direction is fabulous and he keeps a brisk, even, suspenseful pace throughout. Henry Mancini provides a catchy and extremely memorable score.The supporting cast is also solid. Walter Matthau does a good job as the CIA Agent who seems to be the one honest character in the film. James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass are perfectly cast as the menacing yet goofy bad guys. Coburn and Kennedy would soon go on to bigger things and they show why in this film, while Glass is wonderful as the obnoxious sniveling twerp. Jacques Marin also provides an amusing turn as the bewildered French policeman investigating the whole mess (""Three men dead in their pajamas? What is this, a new American fad?"").All in all, ""Charade"" is just a fun film to watch. It works on many different levels and anyone looking for a pleasant waste of two hours should definitely check it out. Supercritical writers could pick out the various plot holes and improbabilities, or pick out the plot twists before they develop. But most viewers will undoubtedly be charmed by the two leads, the wonderful script, and the gorgeous Paris scenery, all the while wondering whodunit? And that's all one can really ask from a film like this.9/10",Charade
126,lyubitelfilmov,Like snow on your head or Tangled Detective with a great ending,8,28 May 2020,"Thriller, detective, comedy. I continue a kind of marathon of paintings with the participation of the magnificent and charming beauty Audrey Hepburn, and today this detective thriller is in turn. The fact is that this picture is part of a collection of three dvd discs, which I acquired relatively recently, in addition to this picture there is ""Afternoon Love"" and the famous ""Roman Vacations"", which I will definitely get to, but a little later. In the meantime, here's my brief opinion - an intricate detective with a great ending. And, if in the film ""How to Steal a Million,"" I didn't mention the minuses, since I didn't find any, then he was found here, but only one, and I will certainly tell you about it, but for now let me begin to analyze this picture.
So, the pros:
1. A confusing story - to be honest, at first the story didn't hook me at all, because the film will talk about a beautiful married lady who has a husband killed, and several suspicious gentlemen who demand a fabulous sum from the newly made widow who allegedly her dead husband stole from them. And then an elderly, but charming Mr. Peter Joshua comes to the rescue, and the girl will have to decide who he is, friend or foe? I was expecting platitudes, in some places I guessed scenario twists, and with this picture I managed to confuse me. Sometimes I myself was lost in thought and conjecture about heroes, events, circumstances, and so on, sometimes even small details. What can I say - the scriptwriters caught me. I can't say that history is drawn to the highest score, but it can't be called a passing middle peasant. This is a solid four, and only because I guessed a few turns. During timekeeping, the story manages to spin several times so that you involuntarily peer at the screen, trying not to miss anything. My regards!
2. Music - and although, apart from the title topic, it does not stand out here, it definitely creates the right mood and immerses the viewer in the events that are taking place. But the title topic is fast, sharp, makes the heart contract as quickly as possible, fast and very dynamic.
3. Paris - and again, all the action takes place in Paris, with its quiet and narrow streets, famous buildings and structures, references to the French classics, and of course the surroundings naturally, though we will not be pleased with the views of the city often, but even in these rare moments Paris mesmerizing.
4. The final - let's say so, everything went approximately to this, there were hints at it, I completely guessed it - and this is good. The ending for this type of picture should be just that, and even from a moral point of view, not to mention another. Yes, I understand that I wrote the obvious thing, but this is my position, you can agree with it, or not - you decide!
Minus. Comedy - I don't understand this from the word ""completely""! We seem to have a serious story with cruelty and murder, a tense atmosphere, and here, in the midst of all this, the heroes begin to show a circus tent at the exit. At first I was not opposed to this, but after the first half I clearly understood how this comedy looks alien here. She does not belong here. I'd better keep silent about the romantic line, because if in ""How to Steal a Million"" I saw a ""spark"" between the characters and I saw circumstances, then this simply did not work here. It turned out a stupid farce, no more.
A little about the main characters:
1. Regina Lampert performed by Audrey Hepburn is an attractive married lady whose life is turned upside down after the news of the murder of her husband. In this situation, she is forced to trust a new friend, Peter, who promises help. It manifests itself as a brave Amazon, dressed in elegant costumes. Beauty Audrey did not disappoint me. Her sweet and innocent smile disarms, her eyes captivate, acting is at the highest level. Bravo Audrey!
2. Peter Joshua, performed by Cary Grant, is Regina's new friend, ready to help her deal with this problem. Charming, strong, clearly has his intentions. A crafty look betrays a true professional. Carey very skillfully played the role of the already elderly protector of the widow. Bravo Carey!
3. Inspector Edouard Granpierre, performed by Jacques Maren, is a Parisian police officer investigating the murder of Regina's husband. In terms of behavior, it looks very much like Inspector Lestrade - he grimaces, tries to follow the trail of a killer, and so on. Jacques very soundly and emotionally played this role.
So why did Soviet censorship not allow this picture to reach the Soviet audience? The whole thing is about one scene, a little frivolous content, and more in the picture I did not find a hint of the ""detrimental influence of the West."" If this scene were not there, then everything would be fine, but we have what we have.
As a result, we have a good detective thriller with a complicated story, a tense atmosphere, an excellent title theme, Parisian surroundings and excellent acting, especially the beautiful Audrey!",Charade
127,vox-sane,A Gem,9,22 April 2002,"""Charade"" is a superb little romantic-mystery-thriller-comedy.  Often called ""Hitchcockian"", it really should be viewed without the mindset one has going into a Hitchcock film.  The irreplaceable Cary Grant and the irrepressible Audrey Hepburn are in a life-and-death situation they never seem to take seriously, pitted against bad guys George Kennedy, James Coburn, and Ned Glass.  For jaded twenty-first century types, part of the solution should be obvious.  Getting there, though, is the fun. Hepburn's husband has been killed, leaving $250,000 (a lot of money in those days) that no one can find. The bad guys think Hepburn has it.  Hepburn is intrigued by, and believably falls for, Cary Grant, in one of his most interesting roles. Grant's film persona is funny and sexy, confident and vulnerable by turns; Hitchcock successfully explored a darker side to the persona, making him a menacing playboy.  Here, Grant is never menacing, but as the story unfolds his character, never changing outwardly or in tone, nevertheless becomes one of the puzzles of the pieces:  is he one of the good guys, one of the bad guys, or a lone ranger after the loot for himself?  Made the same year as another classic, ""The Pink Panther"", the music is another feather in the cap of Henry Mancini, especially with the many variations on the theme song, ""Charade"";  while this score doesn't have the originality and humor of ""The Pink Panther"", it's immensely hummable.  Highly recommended for an audience willing to take its breezy flippancy as offered, rather than looking for something needlessly profound.  It's fun.  It's not a main course, it's a fluffy dessert. Enjoy it.",Charade
128,MF210,A very pleasant surprise,9,6 September 2003,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. When I first saw Charade I had no idea what it was or about. When I had finished watching it, I thought it was a very pleasant surprise. It was very enjoyable throughout. Charade has many strengths, but if I had to say its biggest, it would be the acting. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn give great performances and they have great chemistry together. Walter Matthau has a small but very memorable role. The rest of the supporting cast does great. My only quarrel is the little boy, he was just ok. The movie also has a great script, that it is as intelligent as it is witty. The script blends together Romance, Comedy, and Suspense. All three of them are distributed evenly among the movie. So if you have two hours of spare time, watching Charade is a perfect way to spend it.",Charade
129,Gunn,Best Hitchcock film that Alfred never made!,10,27 September 2010,"This is one of my all time favorite films and I've seen it about 40 or more times over the years. You can't go wrong with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. This is Stanley Donen's masterpiece. He gathered together a fantastic cast: Grant and Hepburn, Walter Matthau, a wily trio of thugs including: James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass and a smattering of excellent French supporting actors. One of its many charms is that is filmed in Paris. Art direction, sound, editing, a wonderful music score by Henry Mancini, costumes for Hepburn by Givenchy that add to her glamour and more assure its status a classic. Donen adds quite a few Hitchcockian touches in the dialog and cinematic scenes. An example: Peter Joshua, Alexander Dyle, Adam Canfield and Brian Cruikshank. If you see the movie you'll know who they are. Plot involves gold stolen from the Nazis in World War II by a few GI's and what's become of it. From the first frame to the last Charade delivers comedy, thrills, chills and romance. What more could a film give an audience. Don't miss Charade!",Charade
130,koofasa,The ultimate witty banter film,10,11 December 2020,This was filmed back when people were witty and light. Stanley Donen did an excellent job with an exceptional cast. The writing is top notch and they actually filmed in Paris. No matter how many times I see this film I always like the reveal. Very clever.,Charade
131,Brucey_D,"...if I were you, I would not stay in my pyjamas...",9,2 February 2017,"A woman finds she knew even less than she thought about her secretive and recently murdered husband. Worse yet, it seems he had twice-stolen money; both the authorities and his former accomplices want it back. But when more people start dying, who can she really trust?.As I write this, there are already 263 reviews on IMDb for this film. It is unlikely that I have anything entirely novel to say about it, yet I still feel compelled to give my impressions of this excellent film, having just seen it for about the fifth time.Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are excellent here; despite his advancing years Grant is pretty spry and Hepburn is as lovely as ever, if painfully skinny-looking.Comparisons are made with Hitchcock films, and not without some justification; Cary Grant rushing around under an assumed identity, helping a beautiful woman involved in a mystery, it is reminiscent of 'North by Northwest'.But this film is really its own thing. The dialogue is so sharp and witty, particularly in the first half of the film; it is difficult to imagine anyone else saying those lines. (BTW this feeling is in no way diminished by the idiotic and lacklustre 'truth about charlie' remake). There are even a few goofy moments and sight gags too (such as when Inspector Grandpierre is watching the Punch and Judy show; I missed that before).There really isn't an on-screen moment wasted, and as it goes on the film's pace and seriousness both increase to a crescendo. I won't spoil it for the first time viewer, but you really are kept guessing, right up to the end.Weirdly this film is in the public domain because of a copyright marking cock-up. My advice is -if watching a video/DVD- to get the best quality version you can find; this film deserves it.",Charade
132,sandnair87,'Charade' Sparkles with the Vigor of Freshly Uncorked Champagne!,9,24 August 2015,"Charade is often hailed as ""the best Hitchcock film that Hitchcock never got around to making"", sometimes thought of in terms of ersatz Hitchcock, and that's understandable. But in hindsight, it really does director Stanley Donen a disservice because he brings into Charade a lot of flair and chutzpah, resulting in a delightful mystery-cum-romance that sparkles with all the vigor of freshly uncorked champagne.The stunningly playful opening credits designed by Maurice Binder places you right amidst the snow- capped mountains of the French Alps, where we see our leading lady Reggie Lambert enjoying a ski trip. She soon returns to Paris to find her house ransacked and her husband dead. His funeral is attended by three curious thugs, each of whom makes sure that the corpse is indeed dead. Peter Joshua, a handsome pickup acquaintance from her vacation, comforts Reggie and offers his assistance, as does CIA man Bartholomew who informs her that her husband was part of a gang which, during World War II, stole and stashed a quarter of a million dollars. Naturally, everyone thinks – mistakenly - that Reggie knows the whereabouts of the money. Meanwhile, Reggie finds herself falling in love with Peter, although she suspects that he too is after the money, especially given his fondness for aliases – first Peter Joshua, then Alexander Dyle, the deceased's heart stricken brother, later as professional thief Adam Canfield, and still later as Brian Cruikshank. The gullible Reggie can't help being befuddled. As the corpses begin to accumulate, it becomes increasingly important - and difficult - for Reggie to determine who the good guys are and who are the villains.Charade plays out as a slick, stylish thriller, with great on location shots and a chic Henry Mancini score, humming along in a breezy entertaining way with plenty of charm. But the film owes its reputation largely to the crackling repartee between its leading stars - the always elegant 32-year-old Audrey Hepburn and the always charismatic 60-year-old Cary Grant. Grant always had a bit of a dark side, a sinister center to his suave humor, that helps him out here as he plays different variations of essentially the same character. We only ever know as much as Hepburn does, and we're never sure we can trust him. It's a great performance. The luminous Hepburn is equally fabulous as she plays the damsel in distress, without giving into the clichés associated with such a character. The sexual chemistry between them, when set against Charade's tumultuous backdrop of shifting identities, makes this movie an enduring favorite.After all these years, Charade still remains the real deal, not some cheap, exploding cheeseburger of a movie pretender. Charade reminds us that when all the elements come together, it's possible for Hollywood to make a flawless entertainment that thoroughly whisks us away. Too bad it doesn't happen more often.",Charade
133,ab-2,A wonderful movie,10,10 November 2001,"Charade is so just so wonderful. The movie follows Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) whose husband has been murdered. She then meets with Peter (Cary Grant) then they befriend each other. She soon learns that a gang is after her husband's fortune and that Peter is not who really claims to be. Who is she going to trust? This movie is just wonderful. It is funny, suspenseful, and great. Grant and Hepburn are a great pair for this film. This movie is everyone and that is why I recommend it to everyone.10/10",Charade
134,imbluzclooby,Grant and Hepburn-As good as it gets!!!,9,17 April 2006,"I love it and totally dug it! Charade is the kind of crime caper that exemplifies how these movies should be made. With humor, tongue and cheek, fast paced action, slick dialogue, and two irresistibly attractive leads, Charade is what Hitchcock should have made. The chemistry between Grant and Hepburn is so palpable and luscious that they become our heroes. Cary Grant was hesitant to play opposite Audrey due to their age difference, but with some revision of the script and her character's brazenness, it was made possible. Thank God!! Walter Matthau, James Coburn and George Kennedy are a fun group of supporting players. I think this film flatters both stars very well and you will discover that the matching is perfectly correct. Grant pulls it off at the seasoned age of 59 and Audrey fits perfectly with him at her beautiful age of 34.Great stuff!!",Charade
135,BJJManchester,'Everybody wants to be like Cary Grant(and Audrey Hepburn)',9,24 September 2005,"A superbly stylish sub-Hitchcock comedy-thriller,only Hitch didn't make it.Still,it had the classiest leading actors ever(Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn),a witty script(Peter Stone),impeccable direction(Stanley Donen) and a faultless supporting cast(Walter Matthau,James Coburn,George Kennedy).The story is of course decidedly far-fetched,but this is a minor negative as the film was designed to be pure entertainment,which it succeeds in achieving in spades. Despite the greying hair and nearing sixty,Grant is still as handsome as ever,and despite the marked age difference between him and Hepburn,they make one of the best screen couples of all time.With any other actor of his age,it would've been an embarrassment but the witty,clever banter and romantic clinches are funny,delightful and charming.The most memorable of many memorable scenes for me is a beautifully judged sequence featuring Cary and Audrey on the boat trip on the Seine.In it's own way,this is one of the most charming and romantic scenes of it's kind ever filmed. CHARADE does counter balance it's superb romantic comedy elements with a surprisingly ruthless edge with the amount of killings involved,done in an admittedly imaginative way but still a trifle over-macabre.But the plot twists are very clever and suspense builds extremely effectively,and despite the plot's improbability,CHARADE still succeeds in being enormously funny,entertaining and thrilling. Screenwriter Stone and director Donen applied this style three years later with ARABESQUE,and although the results were perfectly acceptable,with Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren a decent romantic screen pairing,it didn't repeat the greater all round brilliance that CHARADE passed off with such élan.It is a shame Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn never made another film together,but we can be all grateful that they at least appeared alongside each other once;the chemistry achieved has rarely been matched anywhere else.CHARADE is now rightly regarded as a classic of it's kind,and it's reputation will hopefully continue to grow.RATING:9 out of 10.",Charade
136,g-89622,Old movies are enjoyable,8,13 October 2021,"There are suspense and surprises, laughs and love, handsome guys and beautiful women, snowy mountains and Paris, what more could you ask for? The story is full of twists and turns with the five identity changes of the hero, truly a mystery within a mystery; there is also a classic horror film routine in which a group of people die one by one but do not know who the murderer is, which is full of tension. But the film is not really scary at all, because it is dotted with innocent and nymphomaniac heroines; the lines are extremely sophisticated, and the wise and humorous dialogue is endless.",Charade
137,movieman-200,"Slick and stylish - get ready to unmask ""Charade""",10,30 August 2005,"Charade is director Stanley Donen's masterful attempt to outdo Hitchcock in the department of big screen cinema suspense. To say that Donen succeeds on every level is an understatement. He excels! When Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) returns home from holiday she discovers that her fashionable Paris apartment has been cleaned out by her husband, Charles - who was a double agent, embezzled money from a trio of crooks (headed by James Coburn) and has been murdered. Into the thick of this mystery comes the savvy stranger with too many names, played by Cary Grant. Presenting himself as a friend and confident, Grant is determined to put Regina's mind at ease. But is he or isn't he working for the same men that killed her husband? Walter Matthau does serious, and rather convincingly in an uncharacteristically diabolical role that is particularly engaging.THE TRANSFER: I have a problem with Criterion charging an arm and a leg for their DVD's when so many of them come with little more than bare bones in the way of extra features. Their reissue of ""Charade"" is no exception. You may remember that this title was previously available from Criterion in a non-anamorphic transfer. That oversight has now been corrected. But although colors are exceptionally vibrant and sharp, there remains a considerable amount of edge enhancement and fine shimmering that is detected in horizontal and vertical details throughout the film. The audio is mono and nicely rendered.A more fitting transfer can be found on the flip side of Universal's ""The Trouble With Charlie"" a remake of Charade starring (oh, no!)Mark Walberg and Thandi Newton. Though this remake from Johnathan Demme is about as dismal and disturbing as going through a bikini wax, its one saving grace is that an impeccably rendered and 16X9 enhanced copy of the original film - ""Charade"" comes with it. Hence, the latter is well worth its $15 price tag.EXTRAS: On Criterion's edition only: An essay on the films of Stanley Donen and an audio commentary that is  well, just ample as far as audio commentaries go.BOTTOM LINE: Universal has made ""Charade"" available as part of a double feature with its remake, the genuinely awful ""The Truth About Charlie.""

With romance, sophisticated comedy, and stylish suspense (including a smattering of graphic-for-its-era violence) balanced out deftly, CHARADE is the movie that made me a fan of both Peter Stone and Stanley Donen (yes, I actually saw this before I ever saw one of Donen's musicals!). Every other line is sparklingly quotable, and Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are among my favorite screen couples; pity this was their only big screen teaming (I liked the wry way they kidded the age difference between them, too). James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Walter Matthau (all Oscar winners now!) are in top form in these early screen appearances of theirs. Both Hepburn and Paris look their sophisticated best, and the theme is my favorite by Henry Mancini next to the PINK PANTHER theme. Do try to get ahold of the marvelous Criterion Collection DVD of CHARADE; it's well worth seeking out, with nifty extras including an utterly delightful commentary track by Stanley Donen and the late Peter Stone. By the way, CHARADE is also piggybacked onto the DVD of Jonathan Demme's well-meaning but disappointing remake, THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. On a related note, Donen's second Hitchcock spoof/homage, ARABESQUE, was released as part of a Gregory Peck boxed DVD set. I'm glad ARABESQUE is available on DVD, but I wish they'd recorded a commentary track by Donen and Sophia Loren while they're both still alive and reasonably well. But I digress...watch CHARADE today! :-)",Charade

He's obviously too embarrassed to get into a convo with her about the sexual inadequacies of elderly men. Cary looks like he's just doing a read through with the script around a table. He's not committed. He's relying on his humor to help him survive the filming. He's so tired looking--in fact, for most of the film he has a wan, grey pallor to his skin. Poor Audrey is flitting between murderers after her lost treasure while the audience waits for something to happen. The best actor is the little kid (""I berrcccchhhied it in zee gahden!""). Kennedy's fake hook hangs way too long for his body and he is prone to overacting. I like Coburn's cords. Between Audrey's breath (she was a chain smoker) and Grant's Polident odor, the kissing is rather bland and I'd say must've been tasteless. It's difficult to deep kiss a person with dentures. The scenery is great though. Aaaaaah, Paree!",Charade
141,fletch5,Misplaced elements,7,7 March 2003,"My feelings towards ""Charade"" are fairly mixed. When I first saw it, I wasn't impressed. After repeated viewings, I didn't feel so negative about it anymore, but I still experience it as an uneven combination of light comedy and suspenseful mystery that suffers from some badly misplaced elements.Firstly, the three villains played by Coburn, Kennedy and Glass really seem to belong in another movie, as they are way too quirky characters for this kind of glossy flick. (There's also a terribly annoying kid with his water pistol.) Secondly, the romantic angle between Grant and Hepburn seems ludicrous, mainly due to the huge age gap.Although there are indeed some very nice location shots around Paris, nearly the entire middle section of the film takes place indoors and tends to drag on a bit. Also, Hepburn's acting doesn't quite convince at every turn, but that's almost inessential since she looks so elegant in her Givenchy costumes. Matthau, however, is surprisingly excellent in a rather unusual role for him.",Charade

Not only the villain but also the Character name of Cary Grant is a mystery (Peter Joshua alias Alexander Dyle, alias Adam Canfield alias Brian Cruikshank).

But, no matter when this film takes place, it has a lot of flaws that all the 10-star reviews seem to ignore. First, it suffers from trying to be too many things. A witty comedy, a murder-mystery, a love story. Two many plots spoil the pot. You have to really suspend your disbelief way too early and often, and it becomes just impossible after a while. Audrey's husband gets murdered, and then a strange man lets himself into her apartment. Would you call the police immediately, or begin a love affair with the guy?
To make matters worse, this same guy ""just happens"" to be the guy she ran into during her ski vacation. And she thinks it's just a coincidence?
You're working at a U.N.-type of place in the middle of translating an important meeting. The guy comes in and starts kissing you. Do you shoo him away and continue your work, or leave in the middle of a U.N. meeting to go be with him? It's utterly ridiculous and unbelievable.
Then you find out the guy has lied about his identity 4 different times, yet you STILL trust him?

148,Holdjerhorses,"""You know what's wrong with you?""",9,24 September 2005,"""You know what's wrong with you?"" Audrey Hepburn demands of Cary Grant in ""Charade."" Then, moving aggressively toward him, ""Nothing."" The same is true for Stanley Donen's ""Charade."" From beginning to end, the film pretends to be nothing more than it is: brilliant entertainment.It also functions, perhaps, as the most ""revealing"" exposure of two Hollywood stars ever filmed. ""Exposure"" because, at moments, the carefully tailored script invites Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant to be loose and silly -- an opportunity never afforded either of them on screen before or since.In being silly, we see and know more about Hepburn and Grant as PEOPLE (forget their roles, here, or their Hollywood personas) than in any of their other films.Their delight in working together as actors is palpable from the opening.Their surprising chemistry together seems to develop before our eyes. Their playfulness grows and grows until, at the final reveal, Hepburn opens an American Embassy office door in Paris to discover that the man she (and we) alternately loved, rooted for, suspected and feared has always been a United States official -- and he's making a cross-eyed goofy face at her.We have no reliable way of knowing if that idiotic look was scripted or simply improvised by Mr. Grant and wisely included in the final cut by Director/Producer Donen.Coming thirty years into Grant's remarkably long-lived career, that perfectly-timed boyish stupid expression effectively undercuts his entire filmic persona -- while simultaneously being true to the character and the relationship that has blossomed with Miss Hepburn's character.(Hepburn's responses during ""Charade,"" where her character is essentially a passive victim of circumstances, exhibit astonishing range -- from elegant boredom to sadness, resignation, bewilderment, fright, love, courage. One cannot take one's eyes off her. She too seems to relax here more than in any other of her films, revealing an unencumbered sexuality and forthrightness not apparent in other of her roles.)The sequence with Mr. Grant showering fully clothed is, in retrospect, almost jaw-dropping. Funny? Yes. Shocking? Well, for a supposedly heterosexual screen icon to play this stereotypically ""gay"" may seem shocking today. Limp wrists, sing-song voice, mincing steps and all. How Mr. Donen ever convinced Grant to play this scene this way, or why Grant delivered, it still remains a fascinatingly comic picture of a deeply and ""secretly"" conflicted homosexual actor of a certain era camping it up. And camp it up Grant does. The sequence went over the heads of audiences of the early '60s, when ""Charade"" was released. Nobody was openly gay then.Knowing what we do today, it's delightful. And shocking on more than one level.Just another ""in"" joke like others threaded through this film. (""Here we are, on the street where you live,"" anybody?)The supporting players are all strong. Particularly Walter Matthau, playing (finally and convincingly) against type.Then, there are Miss Hepburn's costumes. Givenchy. Has anyone ever looked so gorgeous or worn clothes so well? Hepburn's celebrated collaboration with Givenchy in both her personal and screen lives is thoroughly documented. Yet here, for some reason (ask Donen) her wardrobe commands attention in every frame.How are clothes CUT like that? What is that coat MADE of? How did they get the seams in that hat? Has any woman -- in Paris OR New York -- ever dressed this well? Nah.She's Audrey Hepburn, you see. And he's Cary Grant.If you want to see two actors, two Golden Age Stars, generations apart, obviously delight in each others' talents and fall in love on screen, glamorously, while undercutting their own glamor and defying you to figure out who's who . . . see ""Charade.""A tour de force on every level.""What's wrong with it?""

150,CelluloidDog,Delightful light comedy mystery with good chemistry by stars,9,5 December 2015,"Charade is an audience delightful film. A comedy caper. And a modest classic. Real rating = 7.7 (= maybe one of the 10 best films of 1963)It really relies on a great storyline, script and sense of humor mostly with terrific twists. However, it is quite a goofy plot in many ways as Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) doesn't know her husband and falls in love with a liar and suspected killer. Shouldn't she stay clear? No! Danger is about and Reggie loves to stay in the middle. There are tons of twists, half of which is created by Cary Grant's nameless character. He's not the Man with No Name, but rather than Man with a Hundred Names. Despite the twists and Cary's changing names, it's as predictable as Cary's character answer to Audrey's ""Is there a Mrs..."" Cary: ""divorced"". So predictably: girl meets boy, the chase, the mystery solved, etc. It runs as smooth as a brand new Mercedes and Cary and Audrey had great chemistry. The audience can get enamored by Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn but it reality, it's one of their weaker performances. It doesn't showcase their talent but relies on their cliché, not much acting but more like (director:) Cary, you are supposed to be know for this, so do that. Same for Audrey. It is largely a star vehicle like Houseboat was for Cary Grant and Sophia Loren. The acting was quite mediocre. George Kennedy and James Coburn were even worst. However, the supporting casts including Jacques Marin (""Three men were killed in their pajamas"") and Ned Glass was funnier and better fits. Although this film is compared to Hitchcock, it rather is much more limited in director's artistic skills. Scenes are limited and routine, cinematography is plain (but I love the opening). It lacks the spectacular Hitchcock camera-work and scenes like Vertigo, Rear Window or North by Northwest. Still the lively pace, writing, suspense and twists keep moviegoers on their toes.Although it falls short on merit, Charade might be one of the 60s most entertaining tangled comedy-mysteries.",Charade

153,Mccadoo,"Uneven film, not Hepburn's or Grant's best by any measure",4,15 March 2021,"With the talent that was in this film it should have been much better than it was. I'm aware that I'm swimming upstream here and that most consider this a classic but I just didn't see it. I actually gave it four stars only because of the actors who were in it, not for the movie itself.
Hepburn's character comes across as a naïve, sort of clueless and helpless woman who believes pretty much anything that's told to her by Grants character. Hepburn was a great actress but she misses on this one, even overplaying scenes from time to time, possibly in an attempt to make her character believable because it really wasn't.
Cary Grant at times seemed to me like he was just going through the motions and some of his attempts at comedy; showering in his cloths and especially the face he makes when the final plot twist is revealed are totally out of his range and persona and fall completely flat. And the romance between he and Hepburn never seems believable in the film, possibly because in real life she's half his age but mostly I think because there isn't great chemistry there.
The supporting cast include some great actors but while they're meant to be funny they mostly come across like the three stooges and feel out of place in what's supposed to be a sophisticated romantic comedy.
Finally, this movie was filmed in Paris which offered the opportunity of many stunning backdrops and yet most of it takes place in dreary hotel rooms and offices. And when scenes do take place outside they're filmed in front of obviously fake backdrops. The dinner cruise is the worst example of this.
There is some clever dialogue here, especially early on in the film but overall it's a disappointment among both Hepburn and Grants canon of work.
If you're looking for a funny and well done Hepburn romantic comedy then watch ""How to Steal a Million"" where she stars opposite Peter O'Toole. It's a much better, much funnier and enjoyable film. For a great Grant romcom I'd suggest ""Father Goose"", his last film in which he stars with Leslie Caron, it's a really funny and enjoyable movie.",Charade

156,gaityr,Check disbelief at the door for one of the sexiest spy (agent!) thrillers ever...,8,25 October 2002,"Upon returning to Paris from a ski vacation, Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn) finds herself newly widowed, and Charlie, the husband she never really knew, hiding a secret from her the darkness and magnitude of which she never could have fathomed. With information provided by Hamilton Bartholomew (Walter Matthau) of the American Embassy, Reggie's hunt for that elusive quarter of a million dollars begins... with the dubious help of the man she meets (and instinctively trusts) in the mountains, Peter Joshua (Cary Grant), and the dogged pursuit of Charlie's partners in crime who want a cut of the money, Tex (James Coburn), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Gideon (Ned Glass). The illicit deal made in the past between Charlie and his army buddies tangles with the present as, one after another, the people after the money keep coming up empty-handed... and dead. Can Reggie's one friend, the man whose name she can never be sure of, be trusted? Or, in the end, is he the one who is ruthlessly eliminating everyone until there's no one else to share the money with? Speaking of which, where *is* the money that Charlie was killed for? Are they all hunting for something that just can't be found?You'll have to find these answers--and such answers they are!--by watching CHARADE yourself. What a treat you'll be letting yourself in for... this in spite of the fact that the film starts out a little slowly, and never quite dispels the feeling that everything one sees and hears as part of the audience is all too well-manufactured. A lot of the banter between Reggie and Peter, for example, seems just a little *too* glib; all the coincidences and plot twists (though they make for simply marvellous movie-watching!) just this side of too perfect. It all fits perfectly during the film, but you do come away from it wondering if you--and Reggie!--have been cheated just once too many times. However, that's just about the only caveat one can find about the extent to which you'll enjoy watching this film. Quite frankly, leave disbelief behind and you'll find yourself just enjoying the ride. Revel in the dialogue (crisp and stylish in the best tradition of romantic comedy), the settings (it's a nice picture of Paris, the ideal backdrop for high espionage and deep romance), and the cleverness of the script. The plot really is quite exceptional, though a bit contrived, and some of the twists--for there are several!--really leave you gasping. If for nothing else, this film is as good as any to serve as an introduction to Cary Grant. He's suave, just a little bit roguish, smiles that heartbreaking smile and tosses off those lines so naturally you'd wish he *had* become the original (James) Bond. From the absolutely priceless orange-game scene, through to his shower fully-clothed for Reggie's sake, Grant displays that impeccable and under-rated comedic timing he was born with... just as he shows his talent for darker drama (mined so successfully by Hitchcock in NOTORIOUS, another top-notch spy thriller) in the final scenes of this film. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, has that innate ability to make the audience fall in love with her over the course of a film--I must say that I hadn't warmed to her at first, thinking her too detached for the film. I don't mean her character, who is *meant* to be a little 'nuts' and detachedly asks for food (repeatedly!) and cigarettes every time she's faced with another stunning revelation. Hepburn herself seemed a bit removed from the action going on in the film, a little oblivious to the other actors around her. Fortunately this sense of distancing didn't last too long--by the time Reggie and Peter stared into each other's eyes while passing oranges under their chins (it's a lot sexier than it sounds, trust me), you could tell that Hepburn was in quite formidable control of her role. I couldn't let this review go by without mentioning the delicious telephone scene in CHARADE, surely a nod to a similar, electrically-charged scene in NOTORIOUS between Grant and Ingrid Bergman. It works, of course, just as one can believe Reggie chasing after Peter despite the discrepancy in their ages.With a great cast, a great script and excellent direction by Stanley Donen (which might explain the Gene Kelly references--one explicit and another subtler--in the film), one really wonders why anyone would even consider remaking CHARADE (i.e. save yourself the trouble of seeing 'The Truth About Charlie', and watch this instead). Grant already is irreplaceable. Add in the other elements of this film--suspense, comedy, drama, the luminous Audrey Hepburn--and CHARADE really is untouchable. 8.5/10",Charade

But who is he really? I mean Cary Grant can't be a bad guy. Or can he? Well, in in the course of the picture, Grant poses, as a businessman, the revenge-seeking brother of one of the bad guys' victims and a professional thief who's also after the stolen money. Each time Hepburn catches him in a lie, he simply comes up with a new name and occupation. ""The man's the same even if the name is different,"" he assures her. Who can she trust? Suspense, intrigue, murder and the screen presence of both stars make this a must see film. Grant and Hepburn are just magical on screen together. The chemistry between these two stars is a timeless thrill to watch and it is also the sad but true fact that there are no stars like these anymore. I mean come on- could you imagine any stars today who can deliver such lines as ""You know what's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing!""

Regina is one of Hepburn's least interesting creations, the character's sole trait is that she's funny (and she is. Hepburn and Grant both are very funny in this). However, the comedy is forced and ill-balanced with the suspense. This isn't nearly as well-crafted as the globe-trotting Hitchcock films in the same vein.

Why hasn't it achieved greater status among the great films of the 20th century?  In my opinion, its even better than Hitchcock's great films of the 50's. There are three reasons this film is great, among others of course. 1) The plot is paced perfectly and you never know who is telling the truth. This movie is about trust.  You cannot be sure that anyone is who they say they are and who's really after the money: hence the name of the film.  I've rarely ever seen something pulled off so flawlessly.  2) Grant and Hepburn.  Two of the most charismatic film stars ever with (at the time) their choice of scripts.  Of course they would choose this absolute gem.3) The dialogue.  It brought be back to the great films of the 40's like Notorious, Big Sleep and Maltese Falcon.

Even knowing the story and the final resolution after maybe the 10th time seeing it, it is still pure pleasure to watch such true super stars in the league of Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn or Walter Matthau. It all fits so seamlessly and is played out so masterfully without visible efforts. It is a perfect study, of what a superb actor Cary Grant really was and still how much he would let his co-actors shine just as well. Oh, what about the story ? Nothing to important, stolen money, a band of rather strange brothers chasing it and above all, romancing and chasing as well, Grant and Hepburn as reluctant lovers.

Gracefulness was her stock-in-trade, and although it came easy to her, it was almost always a star turn--self-conscious, a crutch--until ""Charade."" It's here--paradoxically--that the actress of whom director Fred Zinnemann (""The Nun's Story"") complained was too concerned about her image lets her guard down playing a character who is forced by circumstances to keep her guard up.  As Regina Lampert, the widow of a mystery man, a befuddled middle-aged woman who must rely on the aid of another mystery man to protect her from a motley trio of plug-uglies from her husband's past, Hepburn engages in the sort of acting games that women dream of trying only when they're trying them with Cary Grant.  And together she and Grant go through their paces; let the lights of Paris (courtesy of veteran cinematographer Charles Lang) play off their faces like delicate, fleeting emotions; and glide almost effortlessly toward the inevitable closing embrace. With James Coburn who is made to greet death with the strangest look of surprise ever frozen on an actor's face; Ned Glass; George Kennedy; and Walter Matthau who must surely possess the funniest deadpan face since Buster Keaton.  The denouement--a stirring chase that winds through the Parisian metro to the colonnade of the Palais Royale and beyond--is thrilling, a collaborative triumph of the talents of Stanley Donen who directed it, of Charles Lang who shot it, and of Henry Mancini--fresh from his Oscar win for ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""--who furnished the dazzling score.",Charade

Sure, while everybody gets distracted by watching Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn cavorting happily through Paris (and very distracting they are), the story of this film really deserves more credit than it gets.  The location of the hidden money is very clever, all the more so for being right under everyone's nose all along (including the audience).  In addition to an intriguing story filled with colorful characters, this film is also packed with terrific dialogue of the ""witty banter"" variety.  This contributes enormously to the film's charm, which, other than its stars, is its most bankable asset.  No wonder it is so well-regarded.I'm frankly puzzled by people who seem to resent the fact that this film is compared to Hitchcock.  As though anyone attempting to imitate Hitchcock must be, by definition, a fawning little hack.  Stanley Donen is no hack, and he wasn't fawning.  He realized that Hitchcock was monopolizing a genre he didn't invent, and thought ""Why should he be the only person allowed to make such films?""  Now, Donen doesn't have the reputation Hitchcock has, which is understandable enough.  When compared to films like ""Rear Window"" or ""Vertigo"", ""Charade"" looks rather slight and unimportant.  But it stands toe-to-toe with a film like ""North by Northwest"", and is stronger, I'd say, than ""Notorious"" or ""Strangers on a Train"", just to pick out a few examples. The blending of comedy, romance, and suspense is a difficult one to pull off, and Hitchcock didn't always get it right.  ""Charade"" does. 
The only complaint I have is a small plot detail.  Granted that Cruikshank must adopt a false identity for the purpose of a) deceiving the ""Marx brothers"" and b) finding out whether or not Reggie is involved, he gives Reggie one or two more false identities than he has to.  He tells her he's Peter Joshua, then that he's Alexander Dyle, fine.  But by the time his Dyle persona is blown apart, she already trusts him for the most part (as evidenced by the ease with which she accepts his rather thin story about being a thief), so why not just tell her the truth?  But it's a small flaw, and it doesn't do anything at all to undermine the enjoyment one takes in this lovely and endlessly watchable film.",Charade
165,joliefille411,A Vibrant Spectacle of Twists and Turns,9,30 August 2009,"I don't know how fate drew me to this movie out of hundreds of possibilities, but I promise to be forever grateful. Despite the box- office-busting stars present, this little gem remains relatively obscure. The Grant-Hepburn team was truly delightful- what a shame it was never repeated.In that vein, this is one of the quirkiest films I would have pictured these two typically refined actors working in. While hardly screwball, the performances were definitely not the straight-laced fare I am used to seeing. They really seemed to just be having fun, bantering and goofing off. I think it's great when an actor doesn't have to worry about making every line come out like Shakespeare.The film itself, with its psychedelic James Bond-like intro and self- aware cornball dialog still manages to be gripping. Lots of twists and turns right up until the end- it really keeps you on your toes and interested. A bit more violence than I was expecting for a 60s flick. Nothing overtly gory, of course, but I was shocked that the audience was allowed shots of an asphyxiated corpse.In the end, though, this is a film that will win your heart, and attention, solely on its ability to entertain. No thrilling car chases, no sex in a dark alley, not even a particularly inspiring script. Just a solidly intriguing plot and excellent banter between two of the screen's loveliest gems. And honestly, what more could you ask for in a film?",Charade

170,matjusm,Hitchcock would've been proud,9,6 January 2007,"I just can't help but think of Hitchcock when watching this film. The secretive plot, the twists and turns, its all there.Following the death of Regina Lampert's (Audrey Hebpurn) husband, she find out that he had stolen some 250,000 $ from the government and they want it back. She is also suddenly approached by a man by the name of Peter Joshua who seems to be offering her a helping hand. At the same time however, a group of men are trying to get to her to get that stolen money, which they believe she has. Lampert, who was unaware of her husband's dubious past, must now play a dangerous game of cat and mouse, not knowing who to trust since hardly anyone seems to be who they say they are.Directed by Stanley Donen, this film is very reminiscent of Hitchcock. However it can still stand out by itself. What really amped up the interested was how every development in the story brought about a twist or turn that made you think, who is who and who can you trust. The beautiful Hebpurn plays her role superbly and along with Grant, forms a formidable and interesting duo.A fine film, well worth the watch.",Charade
171,mbanak,Nice and entertaining but ....,6,19 September 2009,"... the acting looked a bit forced to me, and the timing somewhat awkward. Great script, great plot and development. But that budding romance didn't look at all convincing. Still, I held on until the end. Possible Spoilers ... there is an incongruity in there, an inconsistency. I'm still confused about how chummy Grant was with the bad guys on occasion. How about you? Best scene: The fight on the roof. Later, someone is murdered in the hotel, and everybody acts like nice neighbors again. The best acting came from a novelty collector near the end, and from the Paris chief of police. They looked the most natural, anyway. The Hiitchcock-like styling and suspense is unmistakable. But he would have tightened up this loose drum noticeably.",Charade
172,TexMetal4JC,Best non-Hitchcock Hitchcock,10,9 August 2001,"It is certainly understandable how this movie has come to be known as ""the best Hitchcock movie he never made."" Nor should we fault those who have called CHARADE a Hithcock movie. The similarities are uncanny: Shocking opening scene involving a corpse, psychedelic opening credits (a la Vertigo and Psycho), Cary Grant stars as a thief, international intrigue plays a part, the female lead is strong yet beautiful, it has an unexpected plot twist, and it ends with a surprise. AND it's even put out by Universal (just like nearly every other American Hitchcock movie)! Most of all this movie is filled with incredibly black humor that trademarked many of Hitchcock's films. But Charade is not a Hitchcock film, it is a Stanley Donan film. And while it does star Cary Grant as a thief, it does not star a blond-haired leading lady (and by 1963, Hitchcock was deep into his blond-haired obsession - Tippi Hedrin anyone?). Instead, the stunningly beautiful Audrey Hepburn stars opposite Grant, and she has jet-black hair. The story is basically one in which Hepburn's character (Reggie Lampert) finds herself the widow of a murdered husband. She goes on to find, thanks to CIA agent Bartholomew (Walter Matthau in a rare dramatic performance), that her husband had left behind $250,000 in stolen money in some form or another. But that money is not only wanted by the CIA, but by her husband's three - or is it four? - companions who had helped him steal it. These companions, played by Grant, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass, start dying off one by one, and Hepburn finds herself fighting to trust Grant (who keeps revealing a different identity), while all the while falling in love with him.This is truly one of the most underrated movies of all time. First of all, the directing is worthy of Hitchcock. Although it does not include any of Hitchcock's memorable tricks (probably because this is NOT a Hutchcock movie!) it does a very good job of keeping the pace of the movie interesting, while not sacrificing character development or subtlety.
The acting is simply stunning. Cary Grant, slightly gray in this, one of his last movies, is stunning as always, capturing that blend of humor and mischief that  made his To Catch a Thief performance so classic. He shines as always, proving that we may never get an actor like him ever. In CHARADE, it is quite obvious that Ian Flemming knew what he was talking about when he modeled James Bond after Grant's characterisms and acting style. Hepburn is gorgeous. The chemistry between her and Cary is fantastic (on a par with Grant and Grace Kelly in TCaT). Not only that, but on the eve of the sexual revolution, Grant and Hepburn were able to create a movie filled with sexual and steamy romance without a single iota of nudity or crass language. The supporting cast is equally good. Grant's three cohorts are equally funny and diabolical, partly parody and partly malevolent. Matthau also provides some good acting. although he falls somewhat short towards the end.But what really stands out throughout CHARADE is the humor. In the funeral hall, as Hepburn's dead husband lies in repose, his still-living compatriots march in, each in an increasingly funny entrance (think sneezing and door-slamming). The amounts of macabre humor rival any Hitchcock movie out there. Likewise, the screwball hilarity is reminiscent of other Grant classics like ""Arsenic and Old Lace"". For example, after several minutes of debating Grant's taking a shower in Hepburn's room, he walks into the shower and begins scrubbing with his clothes on. The humor and romance intertwined around the intrigue and death is simply beautiful.Once again, CHARADE is severely underrated. It deserves the recognition that ""Rear Window"" and ""Psycho"" receive as being top-notch thrillers. Undoubtedly one of Grant's best movies, and it would have been one of Hitchcock's best, too... If only he had made it.10/10",Charade
173,kidwltm,"Not The Greatest of Movies, But Good For a Fun Time",7,15 July 2003,"I prefer to think of Charade as more of a light-hearted suspense movie more concerned with romance than a hard nosed thriller.  Though the film can be classified as such, the screenplay takes more time to work on the relationship between the two main characters than the average thriller does. And of course it doesn't hurt to have Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, two wonderfully charismatic actors, as your leads. Very well written dialogue for the characters only increases the enjoyment. The film wisely focuses on them and leaves the thrills to the background.  Not to say that stuff isn't well written.  The idea isn't terribly enthralling, but it's executed with enough twists and turns to keep you interested, though if you're anything like me you'll see the surprises coming a mile off.  That was probably the weak point of the film.  It was simply too predictable.   And though I loved the two main characters and I'm glad the film focused on them, I would have like to have seem just a bit more time allotted to the three bad guys.  A little more sculpturing could have made them more effect heels than they were, not that they were bad.  Thanks to Grant and Hepburn, and a devotion by the screenwriters to make their characters great, the film is fun to watch.  The suspense is there, but not amazingly thrilling.  7.5/10* * * 1/2 / * * * *",Charade
174,Cue-ball,Little known gem that surprises to the end,10,7 May 2002,"It's hard to decide what genre this movie really belongs to.  It's a romantic comedy built around a mystery surrounding a mcguffin.  In this case, the mcguffin is a quarter of a million dollars.  The money is supposedly in the possession of Reggie Lambert's (Audrey Hepburn) husband (one of several unlucky folks who aren't around for the final reel) but, after he is murdered, the money is not anywhere to be found.  To help Reggie cope with her husband's murder, the divorcee Peter Joshua mysteriously appears in her apartment, having first met her briefly on a ski vacation. To her dismay, she discovers that some rather unsavory folks are looking for the money -- and think she has it.  A CIA agent named Bartholomew (Walther Matthau) offers to help her, as long as she helps him find the money.  From this point, the movie takes a long of unexpected twists and turns that will frighten and delight you the first time you see it, and amuse your memory every time after that.  You will NOT know the entire story until the last scene.If Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, and a Parisian setting don't sell you, than add Matthau, George Kennedy, James Coburn, Ned Glass, great dialogue, and a soundtrack by Henry Mancini.

Cary Grant keeps changing his identity so you don't really find out who he is until the very last scene. Audrey Hepburn (Reggie Lampert) turns hot & cold with him as he changes his identities. Thrown into this mix is a French police inspector who is trying himself to find out who killed Reggie's husband. Then everyone is after the quarter million dollars in gold that no one can figure out where it is until the end. And therein lies the big mystery - where is all that money? And who is doing all the killing as dead bodies keep piling up? All the constantly changing identities and scheming that Cary Grant pulls off just makes Reggie that more attracted to him.

Cary Grant was far too old and paunchy (he had to try to disguise his age and excess weight by taking a shower fully dressed in a stupid, unfunny sequence). Hepburn could never act and her awful overacting quickly becomes very annoying. Probably the worst thing however is the fact that the story is so obvious and contrived. It is so obvious who the villain is from the very beginning of the movie. Grant should have retired before this rubbish.

178,showtrmp,The Best,10,1 May 2012,"One of the most entertaining movies of all time, and I know I'm not the first (or last) to say so. Hailing from the days when Hollywood knew how to make light, sophisticated, thoroughly artificial entertainment. (When modern Hollywood tries, the results generally thud.) This movie has nothing to do with ""reality"" as we understand it; it's a playground for adults. Audrey Hepburn, as usual, wears faultless Givenchy clothes (on a translator's salary?) and tosses off endless Parisian-style bon mots without the slightest effort (everyone's favorite has got to be her summary of ""what's wrong with"" Cary Grant.) When her life is put in danger, she is just as intense as she was in the thriller ""Wait Until Dark"", but without losing her sense of humor. (After an unsettling sadistic scene where James Coburn corners her in a telephone booth and tortures her with lighted matches, she's discovered by Grant, who asks, ""What are you doing in here?"" ""I'm having a nervous breakdown,"" she growls.) In fact, this movie may be unparalleled in its balancing of comedy and suspense. I find that those who condescend to this type of filmmaking as ""irrelevant"" or ""unimportant"" don't understand how hard it is to come up with truly entertaining fluff.

The way in which the director films the moment when the key characters make an important realization is masterful. Many scenes in the movie are indelible- one wants to jet to Paris to see them all. Unfortunately, much of the film takes places near Les Halles which has been extensively renovated since the movie was filmed. The director captures a slightly-seedy-but-still-elegant hotel perfectly. The characters (villains a-plenty) are beautifully acted and unforgettable. What was Reggie's husband really up to? Who was he?

The first sequence, which a guy falls out of the train, gave me a strong impression and the music was also great.  However, the reason that it is worth seeing is Audrey Hepburn. Like other her movies, she is very enchanting and elegant that the audience has to love her.  Also, despite the age difference, she seems perfect with paring up with Cary Grant.

187,ADAM-53,Cary Grant  the best Bond who never was,10,18 April 2000,"Charade is an elegant and witty adventure. Audrey Hepburn is a UN translator whose husband is killed by a seemingly motiveless murderer. In her Paris home she is menaced by ex-soldiers James Coburn, Ned Glass and George Kennedy, fed confusing information by spy Walter Matthau and aided by the charming but elusive Cary Grant. The plot (five men who were behind enemy lines in wartime Germany stole a hoard of gold. Now four of them have come back to find the loot and the man who double-crossed them) is secondary to the suspense generated in the treasure hunt across Paris. The villains  particularly Kennedy as a one-armed hood who literally makes sparks fly  are genuinely menacing to poor Hepburn's sexy young widow, and trying to work out just on who's side Grant is provides much entertainment (especially as he changes identity every quarter of an hour). Charade's director Stanley Donen (former dancer and maker of musicals) easily out-Hitches Hitchcock. In its way, this was a hugely influential film. The villain with a metal hook motif was taken up again in the Moore Bond Live and Let Die, while the music and editing influenced the later Bond cycle (the film even has a pre-title teaser scene, a trait the later Bonds would make their own). The subplot, about stealing gold during wartime, provided the basis for the Clint Eastwood actioneer Kelly's Heroes and the recent George Clooney effort Three Kings. The photography, lighting and music (courtesy of Henri Mancini) are as good as  if not better than  anything the Bonds of the time could come up with (this is 1963, the same year as From Russia With Love). Particularly riveting is a rooftop fight between Grant and the one-armed Kennedy. This is one of the best fights in cinema history, nasty, suspenseful and with a viciousness that only the Dalton and Brosnan Bond movies have matched in the action films of recent years. When watching the film, you become aware that Grant was the model for the screen Bond. It's a pity he turned down Dr. No and never played the part, but at least here we have a taste of what his Bond might have been like. If you like comedy thrillers you won't want to miss a moment of this one. Director Donen, composer Mancini and scriptwriter Peter Stone reunited three years later for Arabesque, a suspenser with Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck in the Hepburn and Grant roles.",Charade

I appreciate dry humor, which Charade attempts throughout; however, the quality of the writing is such that the humor almost always fails to raise a chuckle. You can see the writer was trying VERY hard to be clever and urbane, but he just wasn't very successful.Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant are their usual wonderful selves, but it's very hard to swallow Hepburn's character's choices, both in survival and in romance.

I think if they toned down the griminess of it all, it would actually be one of the best pictures I have ever seen. That being said though, it is very good. The dialogue is witty and well crafted. The acting is superb and the plot-though complicated-will keep you intrigued. I see some people complain that the story is hard to follow but actually it really isn't.

Cary Grant is fantastic as the enigmatic Peter Joshua, giving his customary stylish grace to his performance. Audrey Hepburn is her usual lovely self as the endangered widow being stalked by unknown men who think she has a treasure that her husband and his squad members from WW II captured and hid. Walter Matthau is the helpful U S Government agent who turns out to be the bad guy. James Coburn is excellent as Tex, George Kennedy and Ned Glass are also in on the caper. As the treasure hunters are killed one by one, the audience tries to guess along with the characters. Who has the loot? who is what they seem and who is putting up a front?

The 2 leads do superbly well in their respective roles. The script is top notch, funny and suspenseful at the right times.You hear people quoting films like the godfather and Casablanca but this is chock full of witty, memorable lines. A favourite of mine being when Hepburn says to Grant, 'you know whats wrong with you?' He replies 'No', she says, 'Nothing.' This is probably more down to the 2 leads chemistry and their acting abilities, but its great stuff to watch.Audrey Hepburns husband has been murdered. Pretty soon it arises that her husband stole some money and 3 bad guys want it back. Cary Grants character also secretly wants it, though his intentions are for the most part unclear. He befriends Hepburn. Cue romance. The film has lots of twists and turns and people aren't who they say they are. Or are they? The movie is enjoyable to watch and superbly made.

I watch this whenever I'm down in the dumps or need cheering up. (It's on tonight on TMC; don't miss it.) And those one liners! I can't imagine any stars today who could deliver such lines as ""You know what's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing."" There are a zillion such lines. And I don't think Audrey Hepburn ever co-starred with anyone who she didn't click with. Sean Connery, Humphrey Bogart, Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney.You can have sexual chemistry on the screen without showing it. Today, they would have these Reggie and Brian (et al.) in bed together.A wonderful movie!",Charade
197,cruizca,Starsystem stuff,7,18 November 2020,"Regina (Audrey Hepburn), plans to divorce her husband after returning from their ski vacation. But when she arrives, she finds an empty apartment and her husband's body in the morgue. Regina learns that her husband owned a quarter of a million dollars from the government, which led to his death. Without losing any sense of humor at any time, the film begins to revolve around a series of characters who appear to claim the money.A film full of clichés of the genre, in which, regardless of the excuse, the plot and the characters must be tangled up to give the impression that everyone is guilty. As such, it does its job.However, and despite underlining that I had a lot of fun, Charade jettisoned the mystery created as soon as Gary Grant (in the film, the man with a thousand names) appeared on the screen. We all know that the plot always has a special role reserved for the star; and this is something with which I just did not commune. I do not like films in which the name of their actors is greater than even the title itself. Sometimes it doesn't even matter if they do it well, just who they are. Fortunately, this is not the case; Hepburn is splendid, and the chemistry she has with Grant is fabulous.",Charade
198,jack.hunter,Pleasant diversion but over rated.,6,2 October 2001,I found this movie to a pleasant diversion but for the life of me cannot understand why so many people find it outstanding.  If it weren't for Cary Grant's charisma I would have found it almost boring.  I thought the movie was a bit dated and the story bordering on the ridiculous.  Not bad but overall disappointing.,Charade
199,zwrite2,Cary Grant ruined this movie,8,25 July 2008,"Actually, I liked ""Charade"" a lot, but I wrote the above provocative headline to make a point about the movie's primary flaw.First, though, I'd like to focus on the positive. ""Charade"" is very enjoyable and very suspenseful, has surprising twists and turns, and has very interesting supportive characters. While watching the movie, I wanted to keep watching to see what would happen next.I was particularly interested in the mystery of whether Cary Grant's character was a good or bad guy. As a viewer, I bonded with the Audrey Hepburn character as she tried to figure out whether Grant was on her side, colluding with her late husband's foes, or a cold-blooded killer and thief.""Charade"" hooked me so much that I watched it three times and was never bored as I rewatched it. Watching the movie again also gave me an opportunity to look for the clues that I didn't pay attention to the first time. ""Charade"" was definitely an effective mystery.However, ""Charade"" was NOT an effective romance. It wasn't credible that Hepburn's character would pursue a man who lied to her constantly, confessed he wanted to steal her husband's $250,000, might have murdered him, and was twice her age. The second he said he was the brother of one of her husband's co-conspirators in the theft of government gold, she should have realized that what appeared to be a chance meeting at a ski resort was, in fact, a reason to suspect he was evil.Hepburn's constant romantic advances were extremely annoying. I blame Grant for the lousy romantic angle because everything I read about this movie says that he would not take the part unless the script was rewritten. Originally, the script had the man pursuing the woman.Director Stanley Donen should have selected someone else to play the male lead  a 40ish James Bond-type playboy whose roguish charm eventually seduces Hepburn, who should have been resisting a romance for most of the movie. Choosing a celebrity over a script is not a good idea.""Charade"" also would have been better if Alfred Hitchcock was the director. Donen does a nice job of balancing suspense, humor and sharp dialogue, but the tone is way too light. People are being killed, but the characters don't convey as much fear as they should. They act like bystanders observing the murders from a distance rather than principals who could be the next to perish.These flaws, though, were not something I thought as much about as the mystery. ""Who killed Hepburn's husband?"" I kept thinking to myself. As ""Charade"" progressed, my interest in the mystery deepened as the possible murderers were killed themselves and the suspect was not shown. Throughout the movie, the supporting characters played by George Kennedy, Ned Glass, James Coburn, and Walter Matthau were all distinctive, entertaining, and well-developed.Getting immersed in the characters pays off when the writers throw viewers for a loop by making surprising revelations about a couple of them near the end.I realize I've asserted that ""Charade"" has major flaws, but I'm giving it an 8 because I really enjoyed its primary plot, suspense, and characters.ZWrite",Charade

201,dfiscaletti8,review for Charade,6,16 December 2012,"Charade was very thrilling as it kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time",Charade
202,Sethtro,Trying too hard to be a romantic comedy & mystery it just became a disappointment,6,24 June 2020,"Personal Rating: 6.4/10As a kid, did you ever look at a slide and think I can't wait to go down that, it has plenty of twists and turns. But come to find out there's no slip to the slide, you have to scoot yourself down the whole time and you end up looking back up at it with distaste?That might be too specific of an illustration but it sums up my experience with Charade. I had high expectations going into this film based on the star-studded cast and while Hepburn and Grant had some alright performances, it certainly wasn't their best.In multiple places, the film felt lacklustre, with camera work that lacked intention. The story told while giving you whiplash with unexpectedness, I felt leaned too much on the ""didn't see it coming"" element and forgot to tell a deeper story. It's not all doom and gloom as the dialogue in many places was quite witty and refreshing.I do have to mention, though I don't have much to stand on as a male, I felt the portrayal and treatment of Audrey's character did not age well and is quite distasteful by today's standards.One example was the constant changing of opinions based on the frivolous come and go emotion of ""love"" in this movie from Hepburn for a character (Grant) mysterious and nothing more than a pretty face: ""I love you"", ""you're a murderer"", *let me kiss you a thousand times*, ""who are you"", all of these changes in feelings based on nothing left me quite confused and dissatisfied with the breadcrumbs of character development here.The script even recognises this fault when Gary Grant says: ""One minute you're chasing me around the shower room the next you're accusing me of murder""By now you are quite aware of the faults I find with this film, but don't get me wrong, it's certainly not the worst thing I've seen. If you're looking for some light-hearted mystery with a great cast this is the film for you. Avoid it though if you're seeking something that you want to stay with you days later.",Charade
203,NickD,Heaven = Hepburn + Grant + Paris,9,5 May 1999,"Audrey Hepburn. . .Cary Grant. . .what more could you want?!? Plus, they're both at the top of their form -- glamorous and hypnotic -- in a pretty good Hitchock-ish suspense thriller. This is Hollywood fantasy filmmaking at its finest. Colorful, glitzy and slightly other-worldly, all coated in a shimmering Henry Mancini score, ""Charade"" has many pleasures, including a frenetic chase through the Paris Metro and a great supporting cast including James Coburn, Ned Glass, George Kennedy and a marvelously villainish Walter Matthau. Pop this one in the VCR!",Charade
204,KubricksRube,"Entertaining, snappy direction, still missing something, SPOILERS!!",7,28 June 2004,"I thought Singin in the Rain was ""dull, unfunny, and over-rated,"" and I stand by that assessment, so I was a little worried about this movie, but I actually enjoyed it nonetheless.It would be impossible to adequately review this movie without even mentioning Hitchcock, as this is the kind of movie he specializes in.  Maybe it's unfair to Donen to contrast and compare to Hitchcock, but I can't help but feel there are areas in this movie that Hitchcock would have done better, and that would be a sense of danger.  Maybe others will disagree, but I did not feel one from this movie.Okay, so that's not really a flaw, just something I personally felt was missing.  But I do like the movie.  I think the acting was great, even Hepburn was good at comic delivery, and normally she leaves me underwhelmed. The directing was good, but not great.  The script was probably the strongest element.There are flaws though.  The script has weak points, some of the most important events in the movie hinge on some very unfeasible things, like Dyle managing to sneak into the US embassy during lunch hour to set up a phony appointment with Hepburn.  And perhaps I missed the explanation for this, but why is it that Hepburn seems to know next to nothing about her husband?  She doesn't know if he's rich or poor, has friends, or anything. Grant's changing identity seems to be an overly-elaborate attempt to keep an otherwise straightforward plot twisting around.  Why would the OSS trust five greedy psychopaths to deliver gold in an important, secret mission?I gave this movie a 7/10.  It was a good, entertaining movie, but not a must-see, and something I doubt I'd watch again.",Charade

206,AH-54,A Perfect Movie,10,7 July 1999,"Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn are absolutely perfect together, and the movie isn't bad either.  I just love the chemistry between the two and it makes me wonder why this was their only movie together.  The story itself is very interesting and unlike most mystery's it holds your attention through the whole movie.Cary Grant in his later years is as dashing and hilarious as ever, but without Audrey Hepburn this movie would have probably been a bore.  Audrey is the only actress that I can actually put myself in the role of.  Unlike most actress's who make themselves out to be ditsy and just plain stupid, Audrey is smart and cute at the same time.Cary and Audrey are perfect for this movie and this movie is perfect for them.",Charade

This film really worked. Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant had great chemistry, and it was great to see both of them, especially Grant, in different roles than I was used to. It kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. I was always wondering what could possibly happen next, and my eyes were always glued to the screen because something important was always just about to happen.The writing for this movie was amazing. The plot was well thought out and although the action was almost constant, everything related to the central plot.I'd recommend this film to anyone. It can appeal to people who like classics, dramas, romances, thrillers, and even comedies. Five stars : )",Charade

Hepburn finds herself being chased by some crooks who claim they're owed money by her late husband, and Grant tries up helping her even though she's unsure of his motives. The movie kind of winks at us through these questions, because the happy ending is never really in doubt. This is the kind of film Hollywood tries to make these days but can't get right.",Charade

Featuring compatible direction and an even more compatible couple, this is top notch classy entertainment. Audrey Hepburn is at her most beautiful and elegant in this movie, and Cary Grant as always delivers whatever is required of him, in this case, playing the charming and playful man of deceit.Charade is a story about a married American girl named Reggie Lambert living in Paris, who is just informed that her husband is dead, and that he has 250,00,000 stolen CIA dollars stashed away somewhere. After getting over the shock she is ambushed by several scary men assuming that she has the money and are threatening to kill her unless she confesses to what she doesn't know. She is found in the comfort of Cary Grant who offers to help her fend off these guys until they figure this whole thing out, until she finds out the he's actually a member of their little group.Charade is a fun movie, with lots of plot line twist and tasteful humour, as well as and a wonderful leading and supporting cast. But the best thing about this movie is that it has a rare complexion of mystery, comedy and romance that is weaved together with such skill by Stanley Donen, making it almost impossible to refuse its charm.",Charade
210,davidking,"Intelligent mixture of Mystery, Romance, Suspense, and Comedy",10,18 June 2001,"The movie Charade is unique, in that it seems to flawlessly blend thegenres of the Mystery of who killed Charles Lampert and his associates,the Romance between Regina Lampert and the elusive 'Peter Joshua', theSuspense Regina experiences trying to figure out what's going on andavoid getting killed, and the ever present comedy, like the way each ofthe victims is killed, and that all of them, except Tex, are found intheir pajamas by the police.Cary Grant, like usual, does an excellent job of portraying hischaracter without dominating the screen, allowing Audrey Hepburn properexposure when they're together; she, of course, returns the favorspectacularly.  The other primary actors also give their best, and helpmake the film a pleasant (or frightening, depending on your point ofview) experience for the audience.  Walter Matthau is also great, goofyenough to lead you on until you discover who he really is.  JacquesMarin is also wonderful as the film's police detective, able to rant andrave about the various complications of the plot without spoiling themovie, or compromising its intent.Overall, I think this is certainly one of Cary Grant's best films, andafter viewing it on DVD for the first time, and reviewing it again withthe audio commentary, I learned more about the film's creation, andenjoyed it more.

A whammy of a thriller loaded with an intelligent plot, complete with twists, that keep the viewer beguiled and mesmerised without getting confused in the process.Cary Grant displays his usual debonair style and lilt to the full in this role, while Audrey Hepburn is anything but the helpless, hapless widow heroine in this golden oldie.George Kennedy, James Coburn and Walter Matthau round out an excellent cast.A memorable theme song helps further the movie's claim to fame.'Charade' treads the fine line between comedy and action deftly such that the tension of one scene is nicely relieved by an adjoining light hearted moment. Superb direction and good editing help the already talented cast achieve this without coming across as campy.'Charade' reeks with the elegance and innocence of a far simpler time, when JFK was in the White House and everything looked absolutely positive.Imagine Cary Grant's character issuing an executive memo to get all office doors in the Paris US Embassy locked during lunch time after it is discovered that one of the villains duped Audrey Hepburn's character by borrowing an office! Today, you'd probably need to undergo a full body search just to get into the embassy! Movies like this are hard to find and even rarer to have stood the test of time.See this one for its plot as well as to soak in a bygone era that is sorely missed by many.",Charade

213,chriswright1969,"Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you can lie from any position, can't you",9,7 February 2019,"The greatest compliment you can bestow on Charade is that it is often mistaken for an Alfred Hitchcock film. Charade's greatest asset is the ingenious screenplay by Peter Stone. A romantic/mystery/comedy story that sometimes comes very close to being a parody, but never crosses that line. That Stone did not even receive an Oscar nomination for best screenplay will remain a mystery.Despite their age difference of 25 years, the pairing of the irreplaceable Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn is gold and paid off at the box office. They were two of the biggest stars in 1963 and this is their only film together. They are supported by memorable performances of then upcoming stars: James Coburn, George Kennedy and a clever Walter Matthau in one of his first comedic parts.Director Stanley Donen had already made his mark in film history with classic musicals like On the Town (1949) and Singin' in the Rain (1952). This sidestep was not only successful, but I consider it his best film. His lightweight tone makes it all seem effortless. Donen tried to repeat the success in 1966 with Arabesque. This time Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren were matched in the leads. But I found this one forced because of an inferior screenplay and the absence of Cary Grant.Maybe it's just me but I also had an early sixties James Bond vibe with Charade. But this must be a coincidence since the second Bond epic From Russia With Love was just released a few months before Charade and the James Bond-formula would not be defined until 1964 with Goldfinger. The similar tone could be that the title design was done by Maurice Binder, who did all the title designs for the official Bond films from 1962 till 1991. But especially the surly George Kennedy with his mechanical arm would have been a great Bond villain. Grant and Kennedy have a Bondian fight scene on a rooftop.Charade does give you a good indication of what Cary Grant would have been like as 007. Grant was on the (long) wish list of the Bond producers. But Cary Grant was too expensive for a modestly budgeted English thriller and a star of his stature in those days did not sign for a series of films in which he would play the same character. In the end they settled for a Scottish amateur body builder with some acting experience who was cheap enough and was willing to sign a six picture deal.And the rest is history......",Charade

Why that woman does not want any security from him? Many people want to kill her but she does not attempt to do anything. Is this orange scene real or made for this movie?However it's lengthy, I liked the story.

The dialog is funny & memorable, the plot twists are incredible, the mounting tension is delicious - just what you'd expect from Alfred Hitchcock, but somehow tempered in the capable hands of Hepburn & Grant so that it isn't a frenzied sort of tension.You simply cannot go wrong by pairing Audrey Hepburn with Cary Grant. These are perhaps the two most charming, attractive & likable actors this world has EVER seen, or is likely to see again. The chemistry is palpable. The supporting cast was also remarkable. The child actor who played Jean-Louis was excellent (it's the only film he's ever done!), as were the actress who played his mother, and the stamp merchant. The 'gang of four' criminals that are after the stolen loot are fantastic - Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy and Ned Glass portray their menacing characters beautifully.

Stimulate the intellect, not the flesh! Witty dialogs are peppered throughout the whole movie. That alone will draw the audience back to the theater again to catch more details.Why can't Hollywood give us today more movies like this, which lingers in your mind for days, instead of the eye and flesh stimulators which leave a bad taste in the audience's soul?Go rent/buy this movie, and watch it with your friends and children.

It is interesting how we always tend to remember the Master of Suspense when talking about those thrillers and sometimes forgot other great and important thrillers made in Hollywood's classic era.This time we have fantastic Audrey Hepburn who plays a widow who sees herself into a plot involving money, the CIA, bad guys and Cary Grant who was the best choice to play the leading man. There is such a chemical between Hepburn and Grant that any other actor or actress would have broken the film's essence completely.But, I warn you: if you are not used to this kind of film, you may find it a little boring. Different from the thrillers made today in Hollywood in which the studios make use of sex and violence to get a huge audience, 'Charade' works in another side. It is not a film developed though scenes, but from smart dialogs, characters and an involving story – and that is why this film is a classic one and proves once more that we don't need a lot of explosions and sex to have a good movie.I took almost a year to see this movie because I was always reluctant with it – I was underrating it before even watching.

Hepburn has one of her best role and is wonderful. Grant is a little bit too old for the part. 10 years before, he would have been exellent - now he is ""just"" great. And why is Hepburn so ""lovesick"" after Grant, when he seems to have no interest ?, how can everybody leave a important office left alone ?, how can she no nothing about her husband ?,  and why is a civil servant running around with guns, searching for money ?

Obviously, whoever was in charge was asleep at the wheel, and then they dropped the ball.Too bad, because the movie in its first 30 - 40 minutes promised top-notch entertainment. The dialogs were witty and pithy, the acting was right on the money, the pace was brisk and airtight. Alas, all that fell by the wayside the moment the movie turned into a romance- wannabe. The main female protagonist is as sexy as a cold dead fish, and the aging male protagonists (Grant) is barely plodding along.Another huge opportunity missed.

She's bewildered, he's charming, and neither of them has been quite who they really are, but at least they're not Meg Ryan and ______ ________ (fill in the blanks here).  I'm so sorry Hollywood doesn't turn out light, amusing little pieces like this anymore; they really should.Finally, a movie that's clever without being ingenuous, twisty without being ridiculous, and funny without having a laugh track.  I don't like being told when to laugh.  Admittedly, the humor in ""Charade"" is fairly subtle.  I laughed my brains out during the orange scene, and even the bit with the matches has its sadistic charm.  The leads make a beautiful couple with beautiful voices, and the whole thing comes off as a sideswipe at Hitchcock: not precisely a parody, not precisely a homage, and definitely not a pale imitation.Rent it.  The groovy music and titles at the beginning are only the beginning.",Charade
228,roy-c,Enjoyable Film,7,27 December 2012,"This is a solid 7 of a film, but not the top 250 type imhoI suspect that Audrey Hepburn's presence has a lot to do with this Positives, The standard of the cast, Comedy thriller - a difficult balancing act, Alfred Hitchcock pasticheNegatives, Would be better with a length of 90 minutes (But I would like almost all films to be cut down to a degree), Cary Grant looked a shade older than optimum, Audrey Hepburn kept throwing herself at the Cary Grant character - looks unconvincing, Lacks the touch of Hitchcock's best workNevertheless altogether a pleasant viewing",Charade
229,egham1,Don't expect to laugh!,4,4 April 2006,"This is supposed to be a comedy thriller. However, like most American Romantic / Sophisticated comedies of the 60s and earlier, it is not funny! The dialogue (I am sure) must be clever and (at times) amusing but not funny. Perhaps the comedy is that a man of advancing years (Cary Grant was 59) could convince a young lady (Audrey Hepburn was 34) that, no matter how many times he lied to her about who he was, she was still in love with him (whoever he was at the time!). Ignoring the absurdity of all that means that we have a pretty good thriller with top class actors (Grant, Hepburn and the magnificent Matthau). I enjoyed it enough to give it five but, after seeing all the rave revues, I expected more. DON'T believe all you read about it, it's not top drawer.",Charade
230,clare_bear25,Audrey is charming as usual,9,23 January 2007,"i bought this DVD for only $4.99(thats in Australian dollars) only because Audrey Hepburn was in it. I thought it was a good movie but thought of it as more of a comedy than a thriller. Despite the fact Cary Grant is way older, he and Audrey have a good chemistry.My favourite bit in the movie is right at the end when Audrey's character Reggie discovers who Cary Grant's character(Peter Joshua/Alexander Dyle/Adam Someone/Brian Crookshanks)really is. i cant help smiling every time i see it. There has also been a remake of Charade with Mark Wahlberg and another one is being planned, but the original is way better.",Charade
231,doug7347,The very best romantic comedy thriller ever made.,10,1 May 2004,"This film is just a simple unpretentious entertainment that works brilliantly.Every one of the very talented participants is in peak form.Cary Grant as the suave romantic leading man echoes his famous Hitchcock roles.  Even at age 59 he was still very handsome.Audrey Hepburn as the damsel in distress still displays her irresistible elfin charm at age 33.The romantic chemistry between these two Brits is unmistakable.  Some critics have complained about the age difference between these romantic leads, but to me that's as important as the mole on Cary Grant's cheek.The supporting cast of Walter Matthau, James Coburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass is brilliant.Likewise, the script by Peter Stone, music by Henry Mancini, and direction by Stanley Donen are top notch.I've enjoyed watching this film over and over as much as I have ""Singin In The Rain"".   I know every scene, but once I start watching it I start smiling again, and don't want to stop.One film student among these reviews mentioned that their professor presented ""Charade"" as an example of film-making perfection.  I agree.""Charade"" belongs in the AFI top 20 at worst, but was not even listed at all.  The reason may be that the studio allowed the copyright to lapse. The commercial motivation of the AFI lists was to sell videos, and Universal lost their commercial motive to promote this gem of a movie.In my opinion ""Charade"" is Stanley Donen's masterpiece, and the very best romantic comedy thriller ever made.",Charade
232,thomash85715,Neither Fish Nor Fowl,5,19 July 2007,"Why there are dozens of positive review rave pages on here for this is a far deeper mystery than any portrayed in the film itself. While the actors are competent, they are miscast and out of their respective elements in this failed attempt at clever storytelling. You can see the red herrings and twists coming from a kilometer away, and the various plot discontinuities and holes comprise a rolling non sequitur that distracts from the visual appeal of the settings and the people. The Hepburn character's sloppy evolution and transition from innocent/naive/bewildered to savvy/manipulative/covetous disproves the myth of an educated actress stopping filming to ask: ""What is my motivation?"" Such a question seems never to have entered anyone's mind at any stage of the proceedings. Much less an answer. I had recorded it off High Def satellite onto High Def digital tape, but will be driving over it with something better now that we managed to sit through the entire thing squirming in our barcaloungers hoping it would get more meaningful but being profoundly disappointed.",Charade
233,Kathing,Wonderful,10,6 March 2001,"The first time I saw this movie I was amazed at how wonderful it was. Witty, intelligent, and thoroughly confusing at times, you become engrossed in trying to figure out just who is trustworthy or not. Of course, Cary Grant never hurts to have on-screen, and this is actually my favorite of Audrey Hepburn's roles. It holds up perfectly. If you want to have fun while watching a movie, start here.",Charade
234,Werewolf-6,One of the only films I purchased more then once...,10,17 January 2000,"This film I rate as a must see for anyone who loves a movie with, suspense, romance, comedy, action, and of course, spies (agents)who loves to watch Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn since this is the only film to star both. Go out today and rent it, I promise you won't be disappointed!",Charade
235,czar-11,A delightful comedy/thriller,9,17 September 2000,"Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn turn in two of their most delicious performances. Hepburn is at her peak (not quite so girlish as Roman Holiday or Sabrina) and Cary Grant is... well, Cary Grant. Plenty of tension mixed in with the humor. A must for any fan of Grant, Hepburn, or just the whole early-60s comedy/thriller genre. The only flaw is in the revelation of the ""McGuffin"" that everybody is chasing; I won't reveal it here, except to say that once they find it nobody (least of all the scriptwriter) seems to realize that it is no longer valuable.",Charade
236,fce2,Dated and bland,4,28 May 2017,"With a whopping 8.0 rating, I expected it to be a fun 60's ride similar perhaps to ""Penelope"" or ""Pink Panther"". Turns out to be nothing like these. It's slow and talky. The mystery is barely there, the romance is unbelievable and the comedy and thriller bits get tired quickly because of poor script and heavy-handed direction. Rather than charming and feminine female character I always turn to older movies for, Hepburn is cold and hysterical. No help comes from unmotivated Grant, and Matthau, Coburn and Kennedy are all underused. The most dumbfounding disappointment though is the location: despite being shot in Paris, the movie stays mostly inside seedy hotel rooms and offices, and even when the action takes us outside, we're treated to process shots and fake backgrounds. This gives the film the hopeless, depressing feel of a Disney sitcom, where you know nothing exciting is going to happen as the plot won't escape the constrains of the 5 rooms it's trapped within.Pros: Henry Mancini score, some witty dialogue in the first actCons: Boring, contrived, claustrophobic",Charade
237,greatalpacaeye,"A strange film, hard to rate",6,5 September 2019,"In the third act the suspense picks up. It was entertaining, but I couldn't forget that the rest of the movie had mostly lacked that.
The dialogue was sometimes clever or funny or well-written--take your pick. At other times, it was horendous (or, perhaps, too clever to get). ""Your life isn't worth the paper it's printed on."" What? Did anyone proofread this thing?",Charade
238,jbraun1984,Who's Who,10,21 October 2005,"As dark comedies go, Charade is about as entertaining as you can get and a must see. All the elements of a great thriller pass before your eyes in a little less than two hours, but you also leave (or get off the couch) with a smile and perhaps even a chuckle, instead of just the usual stretch and yawn. I mean really, how can you get better than this? Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn were perfectly cast in the elegant lead roles of ""Peter Joshua"" and ""Reggie Lambert."" Whether or not those characters were written to be particularly chic, they attained that status by association (or perhaps osmosis) as a result of being played by those two great stylish actors. Yes, there is an age difference between the two (which both Mr. Joshua and Ms. Lambert allude to several times during the movie), however, we seem to accept the building romance between them rather easily, largely due to Mr. Grant's aging, but still well received, charisma. Here, two of the most glamorous stars of the middle portion of the twentieth century...albeit from different halves...work some mild form of sexual magic on film without ever literally going to bed with one another. It works because the 'sex' in this case is the alluring mix of murder, romance, marriage all rolled together in one chaotic screenplay. The real mystery of this multi-mystery thriller lay in the question(s) (which are really presented at the very beginning of the movie...and continue to its very end) ""How, where, and when will Peter Joshua (is that his real name?) and Reggie get together?"" Now for the rest of the fantastic acting/directing ensemble. George Kennedy, James Coburn and Ned Glass nailed the ""less than loyal mean natured old Army partners of the deceased (murdered) husband of the pretty widow who is thought to be hiding a small fortune which is really 'theirs' parts."" The CIA/mystery villain of the story was played to a comic, confusing, and at times terrifying tee by Walter Matthau. And then finally you have a great, a-one, first class director in Stanley Donen (also the producer of the film), who is probably best known for making the greatest musical of them all, ""Singing in the Rain."" Mr. Donen's musical background can be felt throughout the picture as the laughs, surprises, editing (with Jim Clark at the editing reel) and overall pace are well choreographed in the way that a musical would have been told/shownhad this been a musical. Of course, much of this great pacing (and dialog) is due to the terrific writing skills of Peter Stone (and Marc Behm). The addition of some great musical scoring by the legendary master of '60s cocktail music himself Henry Mancini, helped to further support this heavy weight film (which garnished an Academy Award nomination for the title song -the only one for the movie by the way). So what do you get when you put all of this together?...you get a finely orchestrated thilledy or comeder (depending if you are a glass half full or empty person). Often times the movie feels like a Hitchcock film (which I am using as a complement) in the sense that itlooks like Hitchcock, feels like Hitchcock, smells like Hitchcock, tastes like Hitchcockmust be Hitchcockor not. Perhaps it's its own thinga musical mysterywithout the music (which I know is just a mysterybut it's really too lyrical to be JUST a mystery). However you look at it, you get one hell of a fun (killer) ride. What you've missed if you haven't watched: Regina Lambert (Audrey Hepburn) is pursued by four ex (or could be 3 or 5) WW2 Army cohorts of Charles Lambert (is that HIS real name?  her freshly murdered, but was going to divorce anyway, husband). She soon learns that Charles, her husband, stole $250,000 of the US government's money during the war and double-crossed his Army war ""buddies"" in the process. Everyone wants the money, but no one knows just where it is (or that is what we are led to believe). The only real clue(s) left behind by her husband are stored in a Lufthansa bagand seem of little consequence. The story is chock full of deception, with nobody knowing just who is who. Reggie, through all of the new found truths and lies, becomes more and more vulnerableseeking occasional comfort under the multifaceted guises of Peter (whatever his name is). All this fun and action takes place in Paris, which was adeptly filmed by master cinematographer Charles Lang and is one of those films that really makes you feel as if you are in Francenot on a set made to look like France. Around every twist there is a turnwhat's up is probably downand nothing is what it appears. There's some great banter, exciting chase scenes, and a most excellent fight sequence that takes place on the roof of the American Express building between Herman Scobie (George Kennedy's nasty artificial armed character) and Peter (Joshua). Humor and intelligent action pervade until the end though as the tale continues to provide for more murders and deceitculminating in a great game of ""Who do you (really) trust?"" Even the very last few minutes of the movie, after the climax, keep you (or at least Reggie) guessing. This is first rate entertainmenta combination of several genres all rolled into one. It certainly showcases the talents of all the actors, with of course the comic and dramatic timing of Mr. Grant held as a standout. But, it is much more than that. It is also a movie that you can enjoy time and time again for all of its virtuesfor it is not one dimensional. So go ahead and be tricked, thrilled, and tickled for a couple of hours and come away from it  a different person? (Is that really your name?)J. Braun",Charade

I would recommend this film to just about anyone who enjoys quality film making.  A definite 10!",Charade
241,kabukiman2032,Expensive looking waste of talent,2,29 November 2015,"This is a disappointment beyond words. Bumbling director Donen somehow managed to get two fabulous actors like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant with Paris as a backdrop and still comes up with a turkey that is such an insult to smart audiences that I couldn't watch this til the end. There are just too many crucial moments when the movie is sabotaged repetitively from his clumsy, hamfisted work.The story is not too bad but the overacting, including, shockingly, from Hepburn, just spoils everything. The one-liners are weak and sound lame, just like most of the dialogue. You cringe at it when compared to masterpieces from Hitchcock where simplicity assures a timeless elegance that is sorely missed here.What a waste! Don't bother with this one if you appreciate well written film noir. How this could ever get such a high rating beggars belief.",Charade
242,rivitalizzare,Had me guessing for a bit there!,10,4 January 2021,"I'm rating the movie for the time it was made and it was great. I know movies like these have been triggering sjws because anything that isn't part of their agenda drives them mad which is why there are some 1 star reviews. I think it's a shame, but I'm glad to see that others haven't followed suit. The movie follows a woman who doesn't know who to trust after her husband is killed and left her with a large sum of money which she herself doesn't know where it is and other crooks think she's hiding it. What follows is a bit of suspense and chases that leave you guessing at who the woman can trust and who is after her money. I like that the film paid attention to even the little details like the boat scene where even though it was an obvious green screen they still changed the voices to echo when the boat ""passed"" under a tunnel. If you love older movies with good writing and wit, this is worth a look.",Charade

A wife to be widow, knows nothing about his husband. When he dies, Regina (Audrey) gets in the middle of an intrigue to find some mysterious money that his husband stole years ago. The movie try to make you think that someone is the bad guy and then kills him. Repeat until there is only one left. They find the money, end of the story.Two dimensional characters, very unreasonable romance. Boring, and simple. The charm of the 2 main characters kind of save the movie, but in my opinion is very very overrated.",Charade
244,gcglee,Sheer Bliss,9,8 December 2006,"CHARADE would be a movie-lover's treasure for no other reason than it gave Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn their only on-screen pairing. Were there ever two film stars easier to look at than Grant and Hepburn, who epitomized elegance, glamour and sophistication over two generations? Despite their 25 year age difference, their on-screen chemistry is like watching cotton candy being spun out of the air. ""You know what's wrong with you?"" a querulous Hepburn demands of Grant after a trying evening out. ""No, what?"" out-of-sorts Grant replies. Hepburn leans over to him with her liquid doe eyes and dreamily intones, ""Nothing."" That triple entendre, meltingly spoken by Hepburn, delights as a moment of cinematic perfection. Another is Walter Matthau's impeccable comic timing as he corrects Hepburn's mistakenly calling the CIA the ""CIO."" It's worth waiting for.But the stars, gorgeous and witty as they are (check out Hepburn's hilarious final line of the film) are not the only element that makes CHARADE sparkle. The script shines as much as the acting and the direction. The film is unashamedly full of Hitchcock touches (why apologize for borrowing from the best?) yet never feels derivative. The clever original story by Peter Stone and Marc Behm, and fine pacing by director Stanley Donen keeps the audience guessing through the many twists and turns that lead to Hepburn's climactic discovery of Grant's true identity--the ""charade"" of the title.My only quibble would be the shower scene--perhaps taking the borrowings from Hitchcock into parody. It feels unnecessary and slows down the story. Seeing Cary Grant embarrass himself in this way with his effeminate gestures as he washes in his ""drip-dry"" suit jars the viewer temporarily right out of the picture. And the trio of heavies that dominate the first 2/3rds of the film, played by James Coburn, Ned Glass, and George Kennedy, seem to be working too hard to be frightening when no one seems particularly scared of them. Hepburn's panic only begins to register when she confronts Grant at the end. Hepburn saved her intense terror for WAIT UNTIL DARK five years later, so why not let these villains lighten up a little and get into the spirit of the fun? These are minor distractions. With its effervescent score by Henry Mancini, gorgeous wardrobe by Givenchy for Miss Hepburn, and shimmering photography in Paris and Swiss locations by Charles B. Lang, CHARADE is the assured work of old pros, supremely confident movie makers who set out to entertain and did so while barely missing a beat. Even The Master himself was charmed. Hitchcock wanted Grant and Hepburn for the lead roles in THE BIRDS.",Charade
245,highstreet28,Thoroughly disappointing,2,28 October 2018,"I am quite appreciate that I am in a minority, but I found this film hugely disappointing. I'm sure I saw it years ago when we were confined to TV with one or two channels, but with the online choices we have now I can't believe I watched it to the end. The plot was easy to follow, the 'twists' were all predictable, and in the end I just didn't give a toss. The 'romance' was one of the most ridiculous I've ever seen - a relationship between a 60 year old man, who never was that attractive, and a supposed crush from Audrey Hepburn, about half his age and one of the most appealing women in movies. Nah, toe-curling stuff. Much idiocy thrown in, and much of which one would now find quite repulsive - the crass joke about rolling an orange over the breasts of a woman who was actually around the same age as Grant, and the utterly stupid shower shot. The rest of the cast can hang their heads, or just take the money and run, apart from Matthau, who was passable. I'm so glad we've graduated from nonsense like this.",Charade

The story line, as is the case with many ""mysteries,"" has the author taking some liberties. There is, however, one aspect that puzzles me. The scene where Audrey Hepburn discovers James Coburn's body doesn't ring true to me. About three quarters of the way through the film Hepburn enters the hotel room and finds a body on the floor. We see James Coburn dead with a plastic bag over his head. Following that, we then see Hepburn staring in fright at a name written on the floor. If the character could have a hand free to write the name, why didn't he tear off the plastic bag? Did I miss something?",Charade

I had found it amongst a few surviving video tapes in my parents bedroom. I was playing hooky that day, and I decided to see the movie. I dragged my father's ancient VCR out of the storage room and started the film. Of course at first I was bored. I was used to seeing modern crap, but then before I knew it I was pissing on the cowling. I had fallen in love with the film. Charade is a forgotten Masterpiece, it has a stellar cast, (screen legends Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Mathua), great characterization, and of course a great plot. Those of you who have seen Cary Grant films know that normally he's the romantic guy, but in this film hes multi layered and puts on a very dynamic performance. The cinematography is futuristic, the music is cool and gives you this eerie feeling. Hitchcock's overrated north by Northwest is utter crap compared to this!!!!!!",Charade

If you've never seen it, grab some popcorn and a cozy blanket and get ready to be surprised. Everything about this movie is just cool...in an old fashion cutting edge sorta way. This movie has it all, suspense, comedy and an interesting story line.

To my mind, far better than ""Breakfast At Tiffanys"", Charade has a top tongue-in-cheek performance from Cary Grant, a delightfully sinister contribution from Walter Mathau, and a near-comic turn from the battered gangster James Coburn. Wonderful vignettes stay in the mind - the lift and the stairs around it, replete with fussy wrought iron; the body in the bathtub; the scene under the stage, the stamp market -- Stanley Donen excelling himself.",Charade

This movie is an excellent example of why many movies from this time period still seem fresh today. The dialogue is witty and the comebacks fly thick and fast. The plot twists are enough to keep the story interesting but not to the point of being overdone or confusing.

258,mjennings_cot,One of my all time favorites,10,30 May 2014,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. I used to watch it at least once a week my senior year of high school. I watched it so much I knew almost the whole movie word for word. I didn't have cable in my room and had not even heard of the internet. O.o It was the late 80s so all I had was my small TV and a VHS VCR player.Below are comments that may be considered spoilers.Some of my favorite parts are:* When they are on the river boats and the lights go out and ""Peter"" says 'it's okay, come and look."" Spot lights are put on couples kissing. Then they kiss. It is very sweet.* When Reggie asks How can you tell if a person is lying and ""Peter"" tells her the story about the truthful white foot and the lying black foot.* When they are walking by the water talking about who did it and she is eating ice cream. You just have to watch it to understand. Reggie (Regina) changes the subject midstream and it is funny.* The end of the movie when she finds out who ""Peter"" really is and she says, 'You can't even be honest about being dishonest.' or something like that, it has been awhile since I've seen it.",Charade
259,aniket_md,classic and impeccable,9,17 March 2005,"Charade is one of the better movies I have ever seen. It has an excellent suspense plot, great romance played by Audrey and Cary Grant, crisp and witty dialogs, excellent background music and simply superb finish.The plot revolves around Regina Lampert (Audrey), widow of a recently deceased American Charles Lampert, who is killed on a train and has supposedly left behind a fortune of a quarter million dollars. Only trouble is, no one seems to find the money. Regina is chased by 3 thugs; add in the mix the mysterious Peter Joshua/Alexander Dyle/Adam Canfield/Brain Cruikshank (Cary Grant), who seems to change his names like everyday clothes, but is still enchanting enough to gain trust from Regina. The money supposedly belongs to the CIA (and not the CIO...ha ha!) and Mr. Barthalomew wants to recover it for the American government. Needless to say, he wants that money as badly as the thug gang and the mysterious Peter Joshua.The story has great twists in the plot and the on suspense rating, it is at least 9 of 10. The motives of Peter Joshua are very suspect throughout the movie and the end is pure Hitchcock style double somersault.OK, now the great bits. This is the only movie to pair Audrey and Cary Grant, 2 of the most beloved and captivating leads together. Though Grant is 25 years older than Audrey, their romance is not only believable, it is electric!! Audrey has a successful stint of acting opposite men much older than her and this is the best example. Crisp dialog, excellent situational comedy embedded within a great suspect plot and Audrey's enchanting innocence paired with Grant's urbane sophisticated connivery adds a great flair to this movie. This movie can also pass as one of the best classic comedies. Though the movie is a suspense, it is not a thriller. Your heart won't race at incredible pace with anxiety keeping you on the edge throughout. Instead, you can only sit back and enjoy a great romance on the backdrops of a worthy suspense story. A full 10 points to Audrey and Carey as one of the best romantic couples of all time.This movie has the taste of a cultured wine. At no point does it touch vulgarity even once. Even when Audrey asks Grant to use her shower (which would arouse too many amorous hormones in todays cinema), the scene is turned tastefully into one of the best comic sequences of the movie. According to me, this movie demonstrates clearly Audrey has an incredible sex appeal...maybe the best of all time...and she has done it without a single vulgar gesture. Todays female leads need to take some lessons! Finally, ""Truth about Charlie"" is the recent remake of this movie. Frankly, it was not as bad as I expected...but it comes nowhere close to this original gem. I highly recommend this movie to everyone and dare them not to love Audrey and Cary Grant after viewing it. One important hint: You can have both the movies in one single DVD. Get the DVD of ""Truth about Charlie"" and be delighted to find Charade on the other side!",Charade

Not only are the two lead actors, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, marvelous in well-written roles, but the supporting cast (which includes Walter Matthau, James Colburn, and George Kennedy) is also magnificent. The scenery is beautiful and a great background for a great story. The upbeat music, composed by Henry Mancini, is perfect for this thriller. And of course, the script is wonderful with it's different themes like romance, suspense, and thriller. And you just have to love those comedic quips.",Charade

I agree with some posters that Walter Matthau (though a very enjoyable actor) was not the right choice for this film. But you must realize we are pointing this out only after seeing him for do many years in extremely funny films (especialy those films with Jack Lemmon).Perhaps the powers to be were impressed with him and wanted to utilize him in a very important vehicle as this film appears to have been. The main thing is to sit back and enjoy this very classic film. This film makes you want to put more film with CG and AH into your collection or wish that they had made a dozen more films together.",Charade

267,cranbabe,Disappointing and confused,1,4 April 2021,"The acting is mostly atrocious, by all the actors, who otherwise had great acting credits to their names. Hepburn was particularly bad. The script can't decide whether it's a poorly written romance or a poorly acted drama. It shouldn't have tried to be both. The bad guy is obvious. The only saving grace is the mystery of where the money is. The fight scenes are laughable. The child actor is annoying. I'm flabbergasted that people found this suspenseful or clever. I'm terribly disappointed.",Charade
268,LBGladfelter,Charade,8,1 October 2012,"""Charade"" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot – H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the ""I am divorced"" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food.Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her ""not to cry wolf."" Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from ""Charade"" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.",Charade
269,uberpoof,Tongue planted firmly in cheek?,10,24 January 2005,"I just saw this film again last night for the first time in a long while, so I thought I would comment. Charade has always been one of my favorites as it has two of my absolute favorite actors: Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Though I do not think either of them have their best performances in this film, the sheer fact of them acting together bounces this to the top of my list.Now, last night as I watched this, I suddenly realized for the first time how intensely comic this is. Of course, the shower scene, among others, provides for laughs. However, now I'm realizing that almost the entire script is extremely tongue in cheek. With lines like ""Maybe he'll meet his hand in the afterlife,"" how can one deny it? And Hepburn's repeated proclamations of love for Grant...Well, anyway, I think this is great, and one of only two films I was surprised to find out were NOT directed by Hitchcock. The other was The Prize, and that, my friends, is a completely different story.",Charade
270,martin-joey,One of the best old films I've seen,9,1 December 2005,"This is one of the best suspense films I've ever seen. As a kid, I saw it a couple of times, and later bought it along with ""The Truth About Charlie"", the horrible Mark Wahlberg remake. I have seen 'Charlie' once. I have watched Charade 20-30 times. Charade keeps you guessing till the VERY last minute. A little more of a love story than I typically enjoy (I'm a GUY), but the story line carries it pretty well. Coburn, Grant, Hepburn, and Kennedy are fantastic. I think Walter Matthau makes the movie, though, as he plays an atypical part for himself. It's unusual to find humor and suspense woven together as it is in Charade. Toss in the love story, and it's really a unique film. Hepburn's flirting is a little annoying, but I understand that was Cary Grant's choice to be the 'pursued', rather than the pursuer. He thought it was a little creepy for an older man to chase a young girl. I think he was right.",Charade
271,slightlyweirdperson,"Lots of cash, hidden in the most 'not looked in' place makes Reggie the target of five men.",10,29 May 2005,"This is truly a great film for reasons which I need not explain due to their blatant presence when watching.A twisting plot, subzero coolness in the form of a glittering cast and exquisite camera work make this a must see.The duo of Hepburn and Grant is as magical as any, the four henchmen work brilliantly together.The moment when Hepburn enters the Paris apartment is quite startling in it's starkness, she looks tiny! Also, note her expression when she sees Grant in the next metro car, how big are her eyes!A great blend of humour and suspense allowing Cary Grant to show his best qualities and allowing us to see Hepburn at her most radiant.",Charade
272,mcyacw-1,The best comedy thriller of all time,10,11 August 2005,"The genre of comedy thriller is probably the most difficult to do, because being able to sustain tension and to create humor normally strains the credibility of the characters and the story. However, this stylish film manages to do both suspense and comedy superbly, and has a genuinely surprising ending that is truly satisfying. From the very first opening seconds the movie grabs your attention with stylish dialogue and gorgeous settings. Cary Grant and Audrey Heburn have both never been better, and that says an awful lot. It's so well done, that it is a family film in the best sense, one with edge and interest that can thoroughly entertain every age group of the family. In fact, I remember first seeing this film as young child at Radio City Music Hall, and loving it then. It is one of my personal top 5 favorites, and I can see it over and over again.",Charade

And it is the comedic aspect that is lacking in the recent remake of Charade (The Truth About Charlie).In Charade, there is a enough spy/suspense for the guys; romance for the women; and enough comedy for all.Rent this over The Truth About Charlie.",Charade

I only learned to appreciate Charade later. :-) I'm quite disappointed in Dan's comment not much earlier about ""He knew all along that he was looking for these rare stamps stolen from his government!! Why else would he have been sent?"" -- I can only say Dan's deductive powers of ""figuring everything out at the start"" are lacking, as no one knew the money had been converted to stamps.Audrey Hepburn is magical, Cary Grant plays the full spectrum as only he can, and ""chemistry"" starts as repartee, not lust--and no pair ever played repartee better!",Charade

This is clearly one of his three best films (with ""Singin' In The Rain (1952)"" and ""On The Town (1949)""), yet no one seems to remember that he, not Alfred Hitchcock, directed this thriller.  The film is part romance, part comedy, and all suspense, as Audrey Hepburn wonders with the audience whether Cary Grant is the villain or her savior.  Overlooked is an excellent performance by the late Walter Matthau, often thought of in comedic roles but showing his strength in drama as well.  An excellent film, worthy of far more respect than the $2.99 bin at K-Mart.",Charade

Why had I never heard of this movie before?Kudos to the Stanford Theatre for showing movies like this on the big screen and giving people a chance to discover these forgotten treasures.

I didn't know what to expect.  I'm glad I didn't go into the movie with any expectations.  This movie had so many twists and turns.  I thought I had it all figured out, then the next scene bam! what you know goes out the window. It's funny, romantic, and thrilling like everyone has before stated.  I really liked the mysterious music during the movie and the trailer.  It's perfect for a spy movie, yet it's different from the Bond series which I'm so accustomed to.The criterion version came out pretty well.  It didn't seem like it was in that bad a condition.  Too bad it was in mono though.All of Audrey's movies I've seen so far, she has made a great pair with the leading man.

283,baumgartnercm,Excellent movie; I would definitely recommend it!,10,29 August 2010,"Charade is a timeless and classic thriller starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Hepburn plays Regina, a widow whose recently dead husband seems to have left a secret fortune behind. Now she must race against three crooks to find the fortune, assisted by Grant, who is never what he seems. This movie has always been one of my favorites because it combines romance, suspense, and murder in a way that is both thrilling and comedic. Grant steps out of his good guy persona and into a character that may or may not be the bad guy, and Hepburn is fantastic as a woman who really has no choice but to trust him. The film really appeals to all audiences because it does cover so many genres and types. Although this is a great film, no movie can be perfect. Some of the plot twists are a little too twisty, and Grant switches names and aliases so much that only a few of them get fleshed out and understood by the audience. There was a remake of the movie made in 2002, starring Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton. The newer film was never as popular or well now as its predecessor, and Peter Stone, who was a screenwriter for the original, was so against the remake that his name was changed in the credits of the 2002 movie.",Charade

A number of artists have sung ""Masquerade"",and just wondered whether there was written anything about the similarities of the two?

The music is romantic and fitting, and the chemistry between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant is amazingly appealing. It has been said that Grant was troubled about the wide discrepancy between their ages and requested that she be the pursuer of romance instead of the other way around.

The mystery of why the husband was killed and the elimination of the suspects keeps you engaged to the end. Charade is a lovely visit to Paris, both daytime and night.

It has the grace of Audrey Hepburn as she wanders confused through a situation for which she didn't ask.Where the film does not live up to a Hitchcock film is in the filming itself. It is the acting, the plot, the dialogue, and the richness of the actors themselves that makes up for the lack of direction. Still, it is so easy to become so engrossed in the film that overlooking the minor flaws is hardly a feat.The shower scene is classic.
