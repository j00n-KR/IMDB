0,TheLittleSongbird,One of Richard Attenborough's best films,10,14 August 2010,"I am all for ambitious and stately films, which is why I watched Gandhi. And I like Richard Attenborough, I think not only was he a talented actor and director but his films are very interesting. Gandhi is certainly one of his more interesting films, along with the underrated Cry Freedom.Gandhi is just a wonderful film, and do I think it's one of Attenborough's best? Along with Cry Freedom and Shadowlands, yes it is. This film is for me his most ambitious and his most stately, and it is very compelling. True, it is long and perhaps leisurely in pace, but it is well worth the watch for several reasons.Visually it is superb to look at. It was almost like watching a David Lean film, it has the beautiful scenery, the stunning cinematography and the sweeping colours that a Lean film does. I also loved George Fenton's score, it was very epic and moving. Is it his best? Perhaps not, but it is one of his better scores. Attenborough's direction is superb, and the script is thought-provoking. The story, starting with Gandhi's assassination and told mostly in flashback, is interesting and compelling, while the acting also helps drives the film. Words cannot describe how good Ben Kingsley's performance was, composed yet inspirational, sometimes I felt as thought I was actually seeing Gandhi rather than Kingsley. In fact, this is probably the Richard Attenborough-directed film that feels the most authentic in terms of characters and story. Kingsley also gets superb support from Candice Bergen, Edward Fox, John Gielgud and Roshan Seth. Best scene? Lots to pick, but Gandhi's funeral was brilliantly done and one of the most emotional scenes in film and had massive scope to it.Overall, brilliant and one of Attenborough's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Gandhi
1,bkoganbing,Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.........1869-1948,10,5 February 2011,"Films do not come any better than this. The impact of this singular life is still being felt in the world. This man of peace who toppled a mighty empire and caused it to leave his country. Many study his teachings, most importantly the Reverend Martin Luther King for the civil rights movement in America, not enough follow them, especially in Gandhi's own corner of the world. His monument is now a growing and prosperous India that is slowly eradicating poverty form its borders. Gandhi would approve of that, he was not just for independence for the sake of independence, he was deeply interested in the kind of society that would result after the British left India. India's growing prosperity would please him, the religious and ethnic struggles still prevalent in that part of the world would not.The problem in discussing a film like Gandhi is that discussions will overlap into the life of the subject as opposed to the quality of the film. Richard Attenborough having lived a lot of his life during the time when these events took place remembered them well. He's got an eye for the sweep and grandeur of the story, but the life of Gandhi here is never overwhelmed by the spectacle of the film. And Ben Kingsley's Gandhi dominates the film, no wonder he received his Oscar for Best Actor. Ironically enough one of his competitors was Paul Newman who got a nomination for The Verdict which I consider his best performance and my personal favorite of his films. For me to say Kingsley deserved it over him is quite an admission.Gandhi was a devout Hindhu, but he was a man of vision who saw some of the injustices of fundamentalist and exclusionary religious beliefs. Born in the Brahmin caste, he fought against the caste system where social status was stratified by religion in ancient times and people could not rise from it. He was a believer in a land of opportunity, careers that were open to talent. He also was against male domination and treated women as equals. Note that scene where after he's arrested the British soldier offers to take Mrs. Gandhi to shelter, but says she will make the same seditious speech her husband intended to make and they might as well arrest her too.Of the many varied roles in the film by British and Indian players and a couple of Americans as well, the one that really stands out was Edward Fox as General Dyer. Some of the violence during our civil rights struggles in the American south was nothing compared to the Amritsar massacre when as the British commander he opened fire on a peaceful rally and slaughtered hundreds of men, women, and children. We put Nazis to death for atrocities committed in World War II, yet little happened to Dyer except he was put on the shelf and buried like an embarrassment which he certainly was. Fox in that small role captured the haughty military mind and cold blooded ruthlessness that one has to be born with.The ironic thing is that after India did send troops to fight in various theaters in World War I the Indians, Moslems, Hindus, et al, expected independence. They thought it would be peaceful, but Amritsar made revolutionaries of a lot of people. And the sentiment in the British population was for independence. But some politicians like Winston Churchill and press barons like Lord Beaverbrooke whipped up a lot of fear in the Tory ranks for granting independence. It was a stupid and incredibly shortsighted opinion that we still feel the effects of today.Gandhi won several Oscars besides Kingsley's including Best Picture for 1982 and Best Director for Richard Attenborough. The best review I can give Gandhi is that the film is great and worthy of the great man in portrays.",Gandhi
2,SnoopyStyle,grand epic from Attenborough and human scale epic from Kingsley,9,25 January 2015,"The movie starts with the assassination of Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) in 1948. In 1893, Gandhi faces racism in South African. He tries non-violent protest against the pass laws and gains notoriety. In 1915, he arrives back in Indian as a national hero. He supports the war and travels the country to reconnect with his homeland. The rest of the independence movement expect little from the little man but he quickly gains supporters. He urges for non-violence in a campaign for independence.At first glance, it's a bit racist to cast Ben Kingsley as Gandhi but it is an impressive performance from a brilliant actor. Richard Attenborough has made a grand epic of human power. The great thing about Kingsley is that he is able to harness that power. It is a superior movie in almost every way. As in most historical biopics, there are some glossing over and some simplification which is to be expected. I can see some real hate for Gandhi and some who like to point out every flawed statement in his life. It's always a concern but it's nothing too egregious in this case.",Gandhi
3,Horst_In_Translation,"Occasionally an epic biopic thanks to the outstanding lead performance, overall a pretty good movie",6,18 July 2019,"""Gandhi"" is a British/Indian co-production that may be considered today one of the last epics from the old days of cinema. This has partially to do with the gigantic effort when it comes to casting because there are so many actors in here who are just seen very briefly and don't have a word to say, but also with the subject (the title character) and the film's length (slightly over three hours). The director is Richard Attenborough, of course also known to be a very prolific and successful actor who especially had a glorious history with the Golden Globes, but this is his trademark movie when it comes to being the man in charge behind the camera. Same goes for writer John Briley, who was not as prolific as I would have thought. Their collaboration won no less than eight Oscars that year and even if you consider the writer and director deserving, there is no denying how the film stands and falls (well no, only stands) with Ben Kingsley's mesmerizing lead performance. He is in almost every scene from beginning to end and it is pretty funny how he won the Oscar that year probably very easily while being up against four true Hollywood greats in his category and he was basically a nobody that people have not really heard before Gandhi, but afterwards he was a big star of course and is easily recognizable to this day having added several other memorable performances to his body of work.Now as for Gandhi, there is a bit of a frame here. The film starts with his murder and ends with his murder too and the heartbreaking words ""Oh God"" he utters when being shot three times in the chest by somebody who initially posed as a supporter of him. Let's take a deeper look at this film from 1982 that is soon gonna have its 40th anniversary. Maybe depending on when you read this review, it even happened already. You will not find too many familiar faces of actors in here: Martin Sheen appears twice playing a reporter who crosses paths with Gandhi and it was interesting to see him in his younger years. Halmer is maybe more known here in Germany than in the English-speaking countries. Geraldine James had great screen presence, but she is far from a star either. Well, then there is John Gielgud and Harry Potter fans will also recognize a familiar face. Oh and Candice Bergen in her younger years playing a photographer. I immediately recognized her because I have seen Boston Legal in its entirety, but I have no clue what the BAFTAs were thinking when they nominated her for an award. It is really not a big or showy role or one that deserves the attention. Still, she is not bad obviously, but come on she is not even British which could explain that. I think the only one who deserves awards recognition from the cast here is Kingsley and he deserves all he got, probably even more. It is a massive transformation for him too physically about which needs to be said the costume and make-up people also did a marvellous job. Technically, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film.As much as it is all about Gandhi, it is also on really many occasions about the concept of peaceful (not passive) resistance. The best example with Gandhi himself is how he keeps burning the ID cards early on despite being violated in the most cruel manner at the same time. But his will is strong enough to keep going after experiencing injustice right at the very start of the film when we see him board a train in the first class section (yep, Gandhi liked first class in his younger years) certainly not to the amusement of the folks controlling the tickets. This path of resistance mixed with resilience and suffering is also one he takes on two occasions in this movie when it almost costs him his life as he enters into a hunger strike and really hits close to starvation because he stands up this way showing his concern about violence that is nowhere to be found in his agenda. The second example is when Hindus and Muslims constantly clash because they think a certain territory belongs to them. But we do know he will not die from it because either you already knew about the way Gandhi actually died or you just remember from the beginning, so the two religions manage to sort out their troubles at least for a little while so that Gandhi asks for bread again. The scene when that guy arrives at Gandhi's potential deathbed and tells him to eat is also among the most memorable because we find out about a devastating thing he did and Gandhi shows him the path to salvation that is all about loving your (alleged) enemy. And while Gandhi is struggling with opposing the British Empire being in charge of India really during the entire film (there is a pretty nice quote about a bad government by one's own people still being better than a foreign - debatable), he also has to stand up to opposing forces from his own camp. Many times, his closest advisers and the people he believes in the most have ideas that include violence, revolts and fighting and he needs to lead them back onto the path of righteousness that these measures are never the right solution in order to restore or achieve harmony.Still, even if Gandhi is very right about it most of the time, you can certainly debate on his approach. The best example is the exact time when the film takes place, during whcih it is set, namely the days when Nazi Germany tried to subdue the entire world. Or let's say Europe and passive resistance there would not have changed anything most likely. Or would the German people have woken up? Debatable. I kinda doubt it. But let's not focus now on what is wrong with this film or Gandhi's ideas and instead enjoy it for what it was. It definitely felt shorter than way over three hours to me and that also shows how fine a job everybody did. Everybody who was working on this project. I can kinda see why it was so successful, even if I would say that at best it is among the most memorable films from 1982, but not really from the 80s altogether, so it is slightly overrated. Nonetheless, you should absolutely see it, especially if you have an Indian or British background yourself or are just curious about who this man was. There is a reason nobody is really portraying that particular character in films anymore. Because probably nobody would reach Kingsley's level. So, even if you have no connection with Britain and/or India, his turn is still reason enough to check this one out. Also because of the many memorable quotes included here. No hesitation for me here in giving the overall outcome here a thumbs-up. Certainly recommended.",Gandhi
4,mark.waltz,"He wanted to change their minds, not kill them for weaknesses everybody possesses.",10,20 September 2017,"Don't fear the 191 minute running time in this masterful epic that explains in a forward that documenting a year in someone's life like Gandhi is difficult enough, let alone a lifetime. The film starts at the end, with his assassination, where Ghandi simply exclaims ""Oh no!"" as he collapses. Going back more than 50 years, the young Gandhi is explaining his desires for peaceful protests which seem impossible in any era, yet HW persists. Multiple beatings, arrests, court appearances and public speeches keeps that ideal working, making this a lesson in how a huge nation under the control of another got its independence in ways clever, subtly manipulative, often tragic, yet ultimately triumphant.This 191 minute epic then does indeed fly by, featuring one of the greatest screen portrayals of one of the greatest men ever. Ben Kingsley may not be a star, but his performance here gave him household name status, and years later, Steven Spielberg cast Kingsley as a Jewish man working with a non Jewish man to keep Jews out of the concentration camps, it was a reminder of how subtlety in acting creates a great portrayal that doesn't seem like acting at all. Kingsley is transformed into one of the great heroes of the 20th Century and not only looks like Gandhi for over 50 years of his life but makes you believe that he is Gandhi.Under the incredible direction of Sir Richard Attenborough, this historical epic is brought to life. An all-star cast supports him, but many of the actors are only on for a few moments. The script shows that not all the British people in India were rotten, that a few came to the cause because they changed, some didn't have to because they believed in complete equality, and some were downright brutal. This also shows how Indian women were as involved in the fight as men were; in fact, his wife stands up to him in ways that would cause other men instantly kill or beat them. But not the gentle, peace loving Fandi, shown to have minor flaws but with fairness and dignity.I first fell in love with the Indian countryside in ""A Passage to India"", and unfortunately feared that 191 running time in spite of the praise and awards heaped upon it. Unknowns outside of John Gielgud, Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen could have cast in their stead, and the film would remain as potent. But bravo to the casting of Ben Kingsley, because it would take somebody of enormous charisma to play Ghandi and make me not think of him. This is absolutely spectacular.",Gandhi
5,kosmasp,Sir Gandhi,9,4 March 2021,"Seeing the transformation Sir Ben Kingsley takes during the run time of this movie is quite extra ordinary. That alone is worth watching the whole thing - and it 3 hours long, so that is saying something. But add to that the intriguing story of our titular character/real life personality and you have quite the winner here.So while make up really helps us go through the decades with Kingsley (or rather Gandhi)), the way he behaved, the way he ""fought"" is something that was very well put together in this movie. You may know more about him than I did before I watched this - it might be quite likely to be honest, I did not know too much about his life, more about his message and achievements of sorts. But seeing it put to film is a different story - no pun intended, since it is the same story, but you catch my drift.Very well done and with quite a few good actors thrown in for good measure. Too many to just name them all, just check the list if you didn't recognize them yourself. A monumental and epic movie in many if not all the senses of the word.",Gandhi
6,classicsoncall,"""If you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.""",10,1 November 2017,"I was born a couple of years after Mahatma Gandhi's death, and my only impression of the man up till now had been of a small, frail, cloth wrapped Indian who preached non-violence and made it his life's mission. Though I'm certain, as with most movie takes on historical subjects, there are inaccuracies in the telling of his story here, but I was grateful to get a good, general overview of what Gandhi experienced and had to endure as a dedicated and pious servant of India's people. The film is rather epic in scope, with stunning photography and costuming, and the choice of Ben Kingsley to portray Mohandas K. Gandhi was an inspired one. The way he carried the story arc of Gandhi's career from young lawyer to pacifist leader was a genuinely moving characterization. Interestingly, the only time it seems that Gandhi showed any true emotion was the scene where he wept for his dying wife. Otherwise his stoicism in the face of imprisonment and punishment creates a long lasting impression for the viewer, and personally, I can't imagine how he was able to maintain such enduring self control. Not only that, but his tactics during the early part of the Twentieth Century proved to be unparalleled in achieving his political goals for India. It proved undeniably true for the citizens of that vast sub-continent when Gandhi uttered the words - ""I know a way out of hell"".",Gandhi
7,gavin6942,"Ben Kingsley, One of the All-Time Greats",8,5 December 2014,"Biography of Mohandas K. Gandhi (Ben Kingsley), the lawyer who became the famed leader of the Indian revolts against the British rule through his philosophy of nonviolent protest.The cast is pretty amazing: Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen, Daniel Day-Lewis. But Ben Kingsley, of course, steals the show. Unfortunately, it seems he has not maintained the same level of respect since this performance. In everything from ""Schindler's List"" to ""Iron Man 3"" he has shown incredible range, but does not seem to be the A-lister he ought to be.The film is something of an epic in the vein of David Lean, reminding viewers of ""Lawrence of Arabia"". This is the rise of a national hero. Now, it could be criticized for portraying Gandhi in too positive a light (he had negative qualities, too) but when the film is done this well, it is hard to complain.",Gandhi
8,lee_eisenberg,"Does anyone remember ""Gandhi II"" from ""UHF""? Or Robin Williams' comment about Gandhi Jeans?",9,6 January 2006,"What more can we say about Gandhi? Certainly the Mahatma was one of the greatest people who ever lived. Richard Attenborough's movie about him - starring Ben Kingsley in the title role - begins with his assassination and then goes back to his starts as a young lawyer in South Africa, and then shows his life as a non-violent independence leader.Believe it or not, there are some things that I've heard about Gandhi that make him sound a little shakier than we're used to. While he was in South Africa, he spoke for the Indians brought there by England, but not for the black South Africans as much. Also, he apparently believed that Hinduism would rise above all other religions.As for the movie itself, ""Gandhi"" maybe is a little overblown and adores it's subject more than necessary, but it's hard not to. Kingsley is perfect in his role, and Candice Bergen, Martin Sheen, Edward Fox, and the other cast members also do great jobs. A great epic in every sense.One more thing. In ""Weird Al"" Yankovic's movie ""UHF"", he featured a commercial for ""Gandhi II"" (no more Mr. Passive Resistance). Also, Robin Williams once jokingly suggested Gandhi Jeans (sizes 1 and below).",Gandhi
9,jboothmillard,Gandhi,8,17 January 2008,"It may be three hours long, but this is a brilliant epic biographical drama from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director Richard Attenborough (A Bridge Too Far, Cry Freedom). The film oddly starts with the death of the film's leading character, but obviously it is better to know why he was such an important figure in history. So back near the end of the 18th Century, young lawyer Mohandas/Mahatma Karamchand Gandhi (introducing Oscar, twice BAFTA and twice Golden Globe winning Sir Ben Kingsley) is thrown off a train for being ""coloured"" in Africa. Not long after this he begins revolting against the laws of the British in Africa, and when he gets back home to India he is seen as a hero. So using this support of his fellow countrymen, he begins and leads a campaign to make all Indians equal to everyone, especially the British, whatever religion they are (Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, and Christian). Over the many years he became a political leader that helps to free his country from the rule of the British with his philosophy of non-violent protest, i.e. they will attack the opposition, but there is high chance of being attacked themselves. Over a few more years, Gandhi's health weakens, probably because of all the struggle his country goes through to get freedom, but eventually everyone gets what they want. Also starring BAFTA nominated Candice Bergen as Margaret Bourke-White, BAFTA nominated Edward Fox as Gen. Reginald Dyer, Sir John Gielgud as Lord Irwin, Trevor Howard a Judge Broomfield, Sir John Mills as Lord Chelmsford, Martin Sheen as Vince Walker, BAFTA winning Rohini Hattangadi as Mrs. Kasturba M.

Jan Christiaan Smuts, Günther Maria Halmer as Dr. Herman Kallenbach, Saeed Jaffrey as Sardar Valabhhai Patel, Little Britain's Geraldine James as Meerabahen, Alyque Padamsee as Mohammed Ali Jinnah, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's Amrish Puri as Khan, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's BAFTA nominated Roshan Seth as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Ian Bannen as Senior Police Officer Fields, Michael Bryant as Principal Secretary, John Clements as Advocate General, Harry Potter's Richard Griffiths as Collins, The Madness of King George's Nigel Hawthorne as Kinnoch, Bernard Hepton as G.O.C., Michael Hordern as Sir George Hodge, Peter Harlowe as Lord Louis Mountbatten, Jane Myerson as Lady Edwina Mountbatten, Shreeram Lagoo as Professor Gokhale, Om Puri as Nahari, Virendra Razdan as Maulana Azad, Richard Vernon as Sir Edward Gait, Harsh Nayyar as Nathuran Godse, Prabhakar Patankar as Prakash, young then unknown Daniel Day-Lewis as Colin - South African Street Tough, Thunderbirds' Shane Rimmer as Radio Commentator at Funeral, Coronation Street's John Savident as Manager of the Mine, Toy Story's John Ratzenberger as American Lt., driver for Bourke-White and then quite newcomer Bernard Hill as Soldier/train guard. Kingsley is absolutely magnificent, and all the supporting stars are a good help too, a great award winning spectacle. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture by Attenborough, and it was nominated for Best Makeup, Best Music for Ravi Shankar and George Fenton, and Best Sound, it won the BAFTA for Best Film, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design/Art Direction, Best Score, Best Screenplay and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and Best Screenplay.

10,ccthemovieman-1,The Good - And The Bad - Of Gandhi,6,13 February 2006,"THE BAD - Another overt Liberal homage to a ""religious"" man who isn't Christian. Hollywood loves to heap loving praise on Gandhi, the Dali Lama, Buddha, etc. But Jesus Christ? Forget it, says Hollywood. Let Mel Gibson spend his own money on the movie. Candance Bergen and Martin Sheen, two ultra-liberals, make appearances here showing overdone reverence for the ""great man."" If the film was re-made today, we would have Barbra Streisand, Michael Moore and George Clooney all visiting Gandhi.There are several scenes early on when the filmmakers go out of their way to paint Christians as the bad guys and major perpetrators of prejudice. However, in a good-but-not that good instance, we have one Christian minister, played by Ian Charleson, who appears early on as one of the Gandhi's supporters but his theology is a little weak, of course. In fact, Gandhi shows more support for a statement Jesus made than the minister did!Ghandi, who was a good man with incredible inner strength, of course, had his flaws like all of us, but those aren't really pictured since this film is so biased. (Gandi advised England to let Germany run over them without a fight. He also had alleged pedophile instincts. None of these things were remotely touched on....only the good. That certainly wouldn't have been the case if Gandhi was a Christian leader. Those flaws and innuendos would have been front-and--center.)THE GOOD - Politics-aside, the film is interesting all the way, which says a lot since it's a 3-hour film.. Ben Kingsley is superb as Gandhi and the Indian actors do a fine job in their roles. Too bad they don't get any billing on the video box. Although some of Gandhi's statements go against Scripture, with his meekness, love and wonderful gentle attitude, he presents a strong case for the secular argument, which was the obvious intent of the filmmakers. The man presents an outstanding example of a human being devoted to living in peace with everyone and willing to die to help stop violence.It's beautifully filmed and a must to be seen on a widescreen format.",Gandhi
11,rmax304823,Noble Effort.,7,18 November 2009,"There is no question of Gandhi's wisdom or his bravery. He was a standout on both counts. That makes it a little difficult to make a movie about him because flawlessness isn't inherently interesting. He would have been an easier project if he'd kept an opium den or liked little girls. A little realistic ambiguity never hurt anyone. Look at ""Lawrence of Arabia."" As it is, we get what I presume is a roughly accurate picture of Gandhi's mature life, wrapped up as it was with the drive for India's independence. I don't suppose it's giving away too much of the ending to say that his life led to the death that such heroic figures so frequently suffer. Why is it that people of peace are always assassinated while scurrilous and dictatorial thugs seem to go on ruling forever?Ben Kingsley is damned near perfect in the lead role. Not just because he LOOKED almost identical to the older Gandhi but because he captures the man's moods so well, humorous and dramatic both. The film is by necessity a hagiography. I mean, he's celebrated as a leader in India. There is Gandhi Day, a holiday. And he's recognized world wide as a man whose protests were, at his demand, non-violent. Christians ought to be sensitive to those kinds of values, considering that they were espoused by Christianity's founder.There is, of course, conflict, first between the Indians and the British colonial system; then between the Hindus and Moslems, which led to the separation of India into what is now three countries -- Pakistan, India, and Bengladesh. There was nothing Gandhi could do to put a stop to the violence, and the enmity between Pakistan and India lingers to this day.In the film, the Moslems seem to come off worse. Their leader, Jinnah, continues throughout to wear European dress, sometimes a monocle. He seems always to scowl and is dilatory during the independence movement.There are several cameos by well-known actors -- John Gielgud, John Mills, Trevor Howard -- and small but prominent roles for Martin Sheen as the kind of newsman who discovered T. E. Lawrence and for Candice Bergen as the kind of photographer who made Gandhi's a familiar visage in the Western world.The movie is somehow neither gripping nor ""epic"" despite the potential of the material. I really DO wish we'd seen some of Gandhi's weaknesses. He must have had them. After all, he was just human. As it is, we get a picture of the kind of man who once had an awkward moment just to see what it felt like.Fortunately, the movie gives adequate coverage to the Moslem/Hindu conflict. But structurally it's a little anti-climactic. The proper fictional ending would have the hero assassinated just as the battle for independence was won, like Abraham Lincoln. But I don't mind the anti-climax. The reason is that anti-climactic events are often, as here, just as instructive as the events that led to the climax in the first place.It's not just the script that's weak. The director, Richard Attenborough, has clearly put a lot of effort into the film but he's shot it as if it were a TV movies. One close up follows another, not because they are dramatically called for but because Attenborough chose to use this conventional technique. No attention is paid to features of the natural landscape either. India looks like South Africa looked, although, with a few exceptional shots, we don't feel much impact from either location. The movie marches along, a little predictably, and lacks poetry.But the questions it raises have resonance. Is it possible for people to live in peace despite their differences in ethnicity or religion? Or must tribal allegiances continue to lead to more blood historically than political differences ever have, as the priest/sociologist/novelist Andrew Greeley has argued? Gandhi believed that peace could be achieved without violence, but moves on the international chess board constantly suggest he was mistaken.",Gandhi
12,ma-cortes,Splendid biopic about the lawyer who became the prestigious leader of the Indian revolts against the British through his philosophy of non-violence,8,31 October 2013,"Biography of Mohandas K. 'Mahatma Gandhi' , the lawyer who became the famed leader of the Indian revolts against the British rule through his philosophy of nonviolent protest . Gandhi (excellent Ben Kingsley) realizes that the laws are biased against Indians and decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa . Gandhi returns to India in 1915, when he has now abandoned his western clothing for more basic self-made garb of shawls and loincloths . Too weak from World War II to continue enforcing its will in India, Britain finally grants India's independence . Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. He is asked by prominent Indian figures of the day, such as Jawaharlal Nehru (Roshan Seth) , Sardar Vallabhai Patel (Saeed Jaffrey) and Mohammad Ali Jinnah (Padamsee) , to join the fight for Indian independence from the British, despite some within that group believing Gandhi's methods ineffective . Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nation-wide violence. Gandhi declares a hunger strike . All events leading to his assassination in 1948 . It's an enjoyable historical drama story where the protagonist , Ben Kingsley , is awesome . Ben Kingsley looked so much like Mohandas K. Gandhi, many natives thought him to be Gandhi's ghost , Kingsley was recommended for the role by Harold Pinter, who had seen him in a play. This exciting , overproduced and immortal story is plenty of emotion , realized in documentary style , though sometimes results to be overlong . It is an epic and moving tale , as the starring fights violent forces , taking on the risks to survive in a world surrounded by hatred , racism and intolerance . The script relies heavily on the Gandhi life but it doesn't originate boring . It's a brilliant story and though is slow-moving , isn't tiring . Ample support cast formed by notorious secondaries playing brief roles , many of them performing historical characters , such as Candice Bergen as photographer Margaret Bourke-White , Edward Fox as General Dyer , John Gielgud as Lord Irwin , Trevor Howard as Judge Broomfield , John Mills as The Viceroy , and Indian actors such as Saeed Jaffrey as Sardar Patel , Alyque Padamsee as Mohammed Ali Jinnah , Om Puri , Amrish Puri as Khan and Roshan Seth as Pandit Nehru . Furthermore , uncredited Daniel Day Lewis , Dominic Guard , Richard Griffiths , Bernard Hill and John Ratzenberger's brief scene ; being the last film of John Boxer and Sir John Clements. Lush cinematography woven into a rich and exotic tapestry from Ronnie taylor and Billy Williams . Sensitive score by George Fenton , including musical sounds with Hindu motives by Ravi Shankar . The picture was stunningly directed by Richard Attenborough , though no studio was interested in financing the film . Richard cited that most of the financing were solicited from Joseph E. Levine whom agreed to finance in exchange of Attenborough directing A bridge too far and Magic. Richard won the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director for this film . The motion picture was correctly based on historic events , these are the following : Gandhi returns to India in 1915 from South Africa , there he carries out the 'salt march' , he subsequently declares a hunger strike, saying he will not eat until the fighting stops . The fighting does stop eventually, but the country is divided . The actual division between the two new dominions was done according to what has come to be known as the 3 June Plan or Mountbatten Plan . The border between India and Pakistan was determined by a British Government-commissioned report usually referred to as the Radcliffe Line after the London lawyer, Sir Cyril Radcliffe, who wrote it. During 1947, after 350 years of occupying India, the British decide to leave, but not before separating Islamic Pakistan and secular India. Millions of Muslims crossed from India to Pakistan, while an equal number of Hindus, Sikhs, and Christians crossed over from the other side .Pakistan came into being with two non-contiguous enclaves, East Pakistan (today Bangladesh) and West Pakistan, separated geographically by India. India was formed out of the majority Hindu regions of the colony, and Pakistan from the majority Muslim areas. Countries of Modern Indian sub-continent . On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act that finalized the partition arrangement. The newly formed governments were completely unequipped to deal with migrations of such staggering magnitude, and massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the border. Estimates of the number of deaths range around roughly 500,000, with low estimates at 200,000 and high estimates 1.000.000. Gandhi spent his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He thereby angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom finally gets close enough to assassinate him.",Gandhi
13,moonspinner55,"""There have been tyrants, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall...""",6,5 February 2011,"Producer-director Richard Attenborough's biography of Mahatma Gandhi is a bit like the smile on leading actor Ben Kingsley's face: always at the ready, highly sympathetic, and just a touch self-satisfied. The film looms large (with a larger-than-life subject at its forefront), and yet it doesn't have an epic scope, just an epic-length (three hours and eight minutes). In the early 1900s, a bespectacled resident of India--not a cleric or, indeed, a member of public office--calmly accepts his role as the peaceful leader of a resistance movement of Hindus and Muslims against the hissable, heartless British who rule the country. The way John Briley's screenplay presents them, the British are nothing more than a wealthy, lazy monarch who take some kind of secret delight in arresting for Gandhi for no reason (except for being a threat to their regime)--and we in the audience are primed to applaud when Gandhi refuses to be taken for a passive mouthpiece for love and truth, standing firm under their omnipresent glare. Attenborough, who went on to win the Best Director Oscar, gives us the travails of Gandhi without much insight or humor, and the film is like a whitewashed course in a kind of carefully-crafted history (the filmmaker is so reverent of his subject, the thought of delving into Gandhi's less saintly moments would be anathema). Kingsley, himself an Oscar winner for Best Actor, has gone to admirable lengths to look and sound like Mahatma Gandhi, and his work is sterling; however, this vehicle surrounding the great martyr of India is so soaked in good will, good intentions, and good graces that it doesn't have much drive, either thematically or dramatically, particularly in its final hour. The winner of eight Oscars total, including Best Picture, ""Gandhi"" is really just a by-the-numbers (and therefore old-fashioned) heart-tugger...and that's for better or worse. **1/2 from ****",Gandhi
14,blanche-2,A great man gets the great bio he deserves,10,2 November 2009,"Ben Kingsley is ""Gandhi"" in Richard Attenborough's masterpiece of 1982, a sweeping, meticulously constructed story of one of the greatest men of the last - or any - century. The film begins with Gandhi, a young attorney called to work in South Africa, ordered to move to third class despite his ticket, because he is Indian. He refuses and is thrown off the train. Thus began Gandhi's life of sacrifice and service to his cause - to get India its independence from England, but to do so without violence. He points out, rightly, that there are many more Indians than British in India. With a little organization, independence will be theirs.Unfortunately for Gandhi, human nature being what it is, India no sooner wins its independence than its citizens turn around and start killing one another. How devastating that must of been for a man who devoted his life to the cause of freedom. He responds nonviolently, ov course, by fasting until the conflagration stops. He was such a treasure to the people that fear of his death could make them stop fighting.Richard Attenborough filmed in India and assembled a splendid cast that includes: John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, Candace Bergen, Edward Fox, John Mills, Martin Sheen, Athol Fugard, Nigel Hawthorne, even then newcomer Daniel Day-Lewis in a small role.Writer John Briley fashioned a magnificent script and probably worked through tons of material in order to do it.Now we come to Ben Kingsley. When Kingsley filmed this role, he was interviewed by Jack Kroll of Newsweek, and I transcribed the entire interview. It was fascinating to hear this man speak so intelligently and analytically about Gandhi, about religion, and about the process of acting. But of course, Kingsley doesn't ""act"" Gandhi. He is Gandhi. I am unclear about the newsreel footage, whether it was a ""Zelig"" type composite or not - I suspect the footage is real and of the actual Gandhi. Frankly, it's hard to tell. It's not so much Kingsley's physical appearance - a thin man shaves his head, darkens his skin, and puts on Gandhi garb - you've got Gandhi. It's in the way Kingsley walks, his mannerisms, the way he sits, smiles, and speaks, that gives us a full characterization.The eight Oscars won by this film were richly deserved. Someone on the message board asked if this is a true story, reminding me of ""Thirteen Days,"" when one of the reviewers on this site thought that Kenny O'Donnell, JFK's top aide, was fictional. The level of education in this country is extremely sad. Mahatma Gandhi is the pioneer of resistance to tyranny through mass civil disobedience, copied by leaders all over the world. If you're not learning about him in school -there's a problem.Great, great film that enlightens and inspires.",Gandhi
15,Quinoa1984,"an intellectually engaging experience, with a moving central performance at the center",8,29 September 2015,"With Mahatma Mohandas K Gandhi, a man who, in some ways, transformed how non-violent resistance has been practiced in the world for 100 years (basically in the modern era, and MLK was one of his big fans), it's hard to find someone to fill those shoes (or that white outfit he wore from a certain point till he died). Ben Kingsley is that man, and it's so magnetic a performance, so filled with empathy - or rather, he makes this man such a life-force of good, or always trying to be, or being stubborn in the face of insurmountable odds - he IS Gandhi, in a manner of speaking. All the more remarkable that, despite being from India, he is not of that skin color. Does it matter? Talent, heart, actual filling in a role to a point where color no longer matters, it's the kind of thing that helps to transcend the possibilities in movie acting.That may sound of high praise, though this is a good movie. Maybe not great, and I'll get to why for myself personally in a moment. What is impressive is that director Richard Attenborough engages the audience on a massive scale - this story takes place over a period of 50 years (it also starts at the end, with the assassination of the man in 1948). We see how he was put through racial discrimination and battery at the hands of British imperial forces in South Africa, and started off with his non-violent path of resistance all due to fingerprinting for citizens of India. Then of course it's just a matter of time from little rights like that to making the ""Alien"" presence of the British go away. That of course is less easier said and even harder done.It's a struggle that takes place over decades and involves in large part Gandhi winning over an entire nation, piece by piece, speech by speech (at times like that opening act at a rock concert that people don't expect much of, and then wipes everyone else away with what he has to say), and appealing to the better angels of the nature of people. The idea is simple: show the barbarism and problems of the way that Imperial rule is done, and don't fight back. We see these historical events unfold, and Gandhi, via Kingsley, has to come in as a voice that is not always seen as reasonable. When some Indians on a protest march fight back against some soldiers and then kill a couple of them in a vengeful rage, Gandhi insists everyone, all over, stop the run-up to get things moving in the fight against the British. And, Gandhi being Gandhi, he hunger strikes until all marching for freedom stops (momentarily). It won't be the last time, either.There's a lot of rich historical moments going on in the film, and a lot of is engaging just on a historical-intellectual level; in a sense it's a good brother/cousin film to Lawrence of Arabia, also about a man's attempt (kind of successful really) at changing how literally the lines of the map are drawn in a part of the world, and what happens when those very people have to forge new identities. In Arabia it was the cutting-up of countries into what we see today as the Middle East, and in Gandhi it's India and Pakistan. There's intense conflict to mine here, and we see a lot of turmoil in the second half of the film on this level. I also found it remarkable, and the scene itself heartbreaking, that the film's first half ends right at the Intermission point of a gigantic tragedy: the slaughter of over a thousand Indian people by British Colonialists (many women and children). Normally the first half of a film will end on a high note (just the year before in Reds it's at the point where Russia gets its revolution and lovers reunite for good, for example). Here, it's somber, and it sets up the tremendous stakes in the second half for this man.What didn't totally connect with me though were those parts around Gandhi, on an emotional level. Kingsley is so good here, and there's a decent performance usually around the corner (Martin Sheen, Candace Bergen), but I wish there was just a little more about the man himself, on a personal level, than we see here. Sure, there is a really intense moment early on where Gandhi and his wife get into an argument - he almost throws her out of the house until she yells sense into him and he realizes what he's doing - and while I naturally didn't expect more of that, I was hoping to see just a little more of Gandhi as the man, on a personal level, than just as his cultural accomplishments. This is not to decry the film too much, but it just lacked a certain something to the pathos overall that kept it from being great.Of course there's exceptions to this - a scene where a hunger-stricken (near death really) Mahatma has to tell a man who thinks he's going to hell for killing someone what to do is awe-inspiring, especially how Kingsley is on such a low-energy level - but it's really about the sweep and scope of this story that makes Gandhi the film it is. If that's fine for you, have at it. Those looking to see the many flaws that have been pointed out about the man in certain history books (or in the negative/less satisfied comments on IMDb) may not get that. It's a big Oscar-winning biopic, and it does what it does - thankfully there's a performance at the center that is truly great and spectacular, and often for how Kingsley isn't giving big, manic speeches. He's often just talking softly, calmly in a meeting or a courtroom or starving, and it's just... wow.",Gandhi

17,sunwarrior13,A Great Experience,10,16 September 2012,"Gandhi is a biographical film based on the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who led the nonviolent resistance movement against British colonial rule in India during the first half of the 20th century. The film was directed and produced by Sir Richard Attenborough and stars Ben Kingsley in the title role together with Candice Bergen,Edward Fox,John Gielgud,Trevor Howard and John Mills.It was Attenborough's lifelong dream to bring the life story of the Indian political and spiritual leader to the screen. When it finally reached fruition, the 188-minute, Oscar-winning film was one of the most exhaustively thorough biopics ever made.The film begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Mohandas K. Gandhi, a British-trained lawyer, forsakes all worldly possessions to take up the cause of Indian independence. Faced with armed resistance from the British government, he adopts a policy of ""passive resistance,"" endeavoring to win freedom for his people without resorting to bloodshed. In playing Gandhi, an actor must be less concerned with physical verisimilitude than with spiritual presence.But Kingsley is nothing short of astonishing.His performance is amazing, particularly in the way he ages across the five decades which the film depicts.But inspite of his great performance,it is too conventional in illuminating the person and it can be exhausting to the viewer.But nevertheless,it is a remarkable experience that will definitely entertain the viewer.",Gandhi

That's a point in this rather long Biography since the opening and ending scenes are the martyrdom of the great Mahatma.As a film it is dominated by Ben Kingsley's performance and everything else pales in comparison. He carries the movie on his bare, bent shoulders and the extraneous is left unexplored to a large degree. There is no motivation, if they had any, for British enslavement except the obvious that, if they could, they would have the whole world under their Empire. Both the politicians and the soldiers are without any sympathy and have nothing but contempt for their subjects.So we see it all from Gandhi's perspective and it is a brave, noble, self-sacrificing, unselfish view. He did make a difference. The irony is that the Muslim-Hindu clash was as devastating as the British control. However, at least this indigenous Indian problem was homegrown and not forcibly fostered on the citizens by a foreign occupation.As a movie it is maybe a bit too long and given its length could have tried to interject more depth to the Nation's overwhelming problems, but the film is about a man and for that it succeeds in its endearing attempt to portray the little man with the big ideas quite receptively.",Gandhi

Most of us are not worthy to kiss his sandals.Richard Attenborough gave us a memorable performance as Kris Kringle on Miracle on 34th Street, but he gave us so much more as director of this film. He kept us glued to the screen for the entire 188 minutes, and made a film that we return to over and over.Ben Kingsley was outstanding in House of Sand and Fog, Sexy Beast, and Bugsy, but he was head and shoulders above in his role as Gandhi.

I actually watch some scene's from this movie in history class when I was still at high school.""Ghandi"" tells the true story of a truly remarkable character that changed an entire nation. The story is told with lots of visual splendour, with good locations and cinematography, which are also two of the few categories for which this movie received an Oscar.But the biggest strength of the movie is not in the sets or cinematography but in Ben Kingsley performance. Not only does he look like Gandhi but he also acts like him, including his walk and certain gestures. The cast is filled with many big names such as Martin Sheen, Sir John Gielgud, Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Edward Fox and some famous Indian actors. But unlike Attenborough's other movie ""A Bridge Too Far"" it isn't a celebrity overkill mainly thanks to it that all the other characters are all just mainly play small parts in the movie and the main focus is and stays on Gandhi.Sure there are some slow points in the movie but they don't make the movie less interesting to watch, believe me, I watched this movie VERY late at night and I didn't felt sleepy for one moment. I was intrigued by the movie and its main character.It's a bit of a shame that at times the story is very one sided and the English are portrayed like mindless villains.

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Beautiful film,8,3 November 2006,"I knew little of the man whose name graces the title of this film before I watched it... I knew the name and had a vague idea of what he stood for, but that was it. Through this extensive three-hour biography, I was told what appears to be almost all of it. Gandhi was an extraordinary man. His philosophy of not fighting physically, but simply resisting, to let the oppressors of his people come to realize by themselves that they were on the wrong(while it arguably would not have worked many other places or even at other points in time) was truly genius. A peaceful revolution, a non-violent overthrowing of government... it sounds as if those sentences contradict themselves, but through this man's work, they were proved to be true. The plot is interesting, and takes off from the very beginning. The pacing varies, but is mostly good. The acting is all very strong... Kingsley *became* Gandhi. The characters are well-written, though there certainly are many of them... you'll need to pay close attention and concentrate to be able to remember all of them. The cinematography and editing is of high quality, though it's often kept relatively simple. The dialog is expertly written... when Gandhi speaks, whether simply stating his philosophies and claiming the rights of his people, or using his clever wit to expose the ignorance and unfairness of his oppressors, it's perfect. You can not argue with this man's intentions, and the effectiveness of his methods is widely renowned. Yes, he may have been stubborn, perhaps even too much for his own good... but his fight, his victory changed the world, and his example will remain an inspiration for years to come. I recommend this film to any fan of the people involved in making it and anyone interested in Gandhi. 8/10",Gandhi

Later, Gandhi becomes a national hero and leader who calls for India's independence from Great Britain, but who does so by strictly non-violent protest, which amazingly does work for them, since they gain world sympathy due to favorable press coverage.

Given Gandhi's fight for justice for all, I just cannot imagine he would have disregarded the human rights of black natives in South Africa.Anyway, kudos to Ben Kingsley (who was excellent in Sneakers) and also of course to the director.

27,JamesHitchcock,No man's life can be encompassed in one telling,8,11 July 2014,"Richard Attenborough had long cherished the ambition of making a film about Mahatma Gandhi, an ambition dating back at least to the early sixties, and eventually got to realise his dream some twenty years later. The film does not cover Gandhi's early life but opens with his assassination by the Hindu fanatic Nathuram Godse and then jumps backwards to what was to become a defining episode in his life, the time in 1893 when he was thrown out of a first-class carriage in Natal, despite having a first-class ticket, something which opened his eyes to the reality of racial discrimination. The film then deals with his fight for the rights of Indians in what were then the British Crown Colonies of the Cape Colony and Natal. (The film gives the rather misleading impression that South Africa already existed as a united nation in the 1890s; in fact it did not become a single Dominion until 1910). Even after his return to India, Gandhi's political ambitions were still rather limited; he initially fought for greater rights for Indians within the British Empire, and even supported the British war effort in 1914-18. Gradually, however, he became concerted to the idea of full Indian independence, and the film chronicles his struggle to achieve this through a policy of non-violent non-cooperation. A key event in the evolution of his political thought appears to have been the Amritsar massacre of 1919 when over 300 protesters were shot dead in cold blood by troops under the command of General Dyer. In some respects the film raises more questions than it answers. It does not explain why Indians who had been so keen to adopt Gandhi's strategy of non-violence during the independence struggle could not find a non- violent solution to the disputes between Hindus and Muslims. (Several hundred thousand people died in sectarian violence during Partition). Nor does it explore the motivation of (or even acknowledge the existence of) those Indian nationalists who rejected non-violence, such as Subhas Chandra Bhose's pro-Axis Indian National Army. Nor does Attenborough really tackle philosophical objections to non-violence, such as George Orwell's celebrated dictum that those who abjure violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalf. Gandhi's attitude to Nazism during the war struck many Britons, even those who were otherwise sympathetic to the Indian cause, as being at best naive, at worst ambivalent. Pakistanis might well take exception to the rather negative portrayal of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of their country. These, however, are not really criticisms of the film as a film. Yes, it is rather too hagiographic for my tastes, but then it is Richard Attenborough's film, not mine, and he had the right to show the world Gandhi as he saw him. As he himself put it ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling"", honestly admitting that, like all biopics, this is an edited version of the life of its subject, deliberately edited to produce a coherent view of a man's life as seen from a particular viewpoint. And it must be admitted that Attenborough carries out his task with great skill. He was lucky to find the right actor for the job in the shape of Ben Kingsley who accepts a difficult challenge and makes this into the role of a lifetime. Kingsley's Gandhi dominates the screen, a man who combines great humanity with great strength of will, who manages to be both simple and profound. The role won Kingsley a well-deserved ""Best Actor"" Oscar and launched him on a stellar career. None of the rest of the cast can compete with Kingsley, although there are several cameos by the great and the good of British cinema such as John Mills, John Gielgud and Trevor Howard. Perhaps the best of these comes from Edward Fox as the cold, heartless Dyer. I was less impressed by Gandhi's various British and American acolytes, who play a surprisingly large part in the film, as if to suggest that Indian independence could not have been won without the support of white liberals. Ian Charleson, last seen as Eric Liddell in ""Chariots of Fire"", here appears as another man of the cloth, the Revd Charles Freer Andrews. There are also bit-parts for Candice Bergen and Martin Sheen, as if to suggest that all those Oscars could not have been won by a British film without at least a token contribution from some Hollywood Big Names. I am aware that ""Gandhi's"" Best Picture award is controversial among the militant wing of the Spielbergista movement, who resent it for depriving ""ET"" of the supreme honour, but I will reserve my comments on that particular controversy as I have not seen Spielberg's film since the eighties. (My own vote for ""Best Film of 1982"" would have gone to ""Blade Runner"", but we must remember that at the time the Academy only had available to them the original cut, not Ridley Scott's later director's cut). I will only say that, whatever one's view of Gandhi himself, there can be no denying that it is a superbly made film. It could perhaps have done with some discreet cutting to reduce its length by about 20 minutes, but it is nevertheless a monumental work. Some moments, particularly Gandhi's funeral and the heart-stopping recreation of the Amritsar Massacre, achieve a truly epic status. Following the success of ""Chariots of Fire"" the previous year, Attenborough confirmed the truth of Colin Welland's cry, ""The British are coming!"" Had the Academy not unaccountably preferred ""Terms of Endearment"" to ""Educating Rita"" in 1983, we would have made it a hat-trick. 8/10",Gandhi
28,StevePulaski,"While attentive to key aspects in humanizing a character, it still makes the same mistake many biopics and epics do",6,21 January 2015,"Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is the perfect film to show someone if they want to see the true art of character actor and witness an actor lose himself in a role for over three hours. Ben Kingsley commands the screen as Mahatma Gandhi, almost never leaving the frame, and with that, creates an immersing film on the basis of a figure alone, who transitions epic and larger-than-life boundaries to become a man on a human level. The opening title card of the film states that it's impossible for a single film to show and develop all of one man's accomplishments on screen, as well as giving each time period and year their allotted weight and detail. However, this particular film's prime goal is to be spiritually accurate and faithful to the life of Gandhi by showing his active pluralism, reading and following Hindu, Christian, Muslim, and Jewish principles and being a loyal man of God through various different religions.On that level, Gandhi succeeds overwhelmingly; at over three hours, the spiritual effects of the film are never desecrated, nor limited in their size or impact. Writer John Briley and Attenborough provide keen attention to detail in various spiritual aspects of the film, not only showing Gandhi as a loyal follower, but delicately handling each religion with its own respect and grace. On a human level, Gandhi succeeds for the most part because having the man in the frame for most of the film, through his journey of courageous, non-violent resistance and self-doubt, provide for a focus that is deeply rooted in realism and human emotions. Gandhi, however, doesn't overcome the hump of basically doing exactly what its title card said was impossible from the get-go; the film, at one-hundred and eighty-seven minutes long, tries to pack in far too much and, in turn, becomes a grating sit well into its two hours. We see important historical events that are either not fully developed or shortchanged so that the film can be inclusive to nearly every major event in Gandhi's life, and it is with the film's persistency to check off a laundry list of events that it obscures opportunities to further humanize its central figure.The film follows Kingsley's Gandhi as a man who was motivated following being thrown from a train in South Africa for being in the traditionally all-white first class section to liberate the Indian people of the region. Gandhi preaches the gospel of non-violent resistance, which doesn't condone acts of brutality against oppressors, however, doesn't accept passivity either. Gandhi believes in resistance that shows that he and his brothers and sisters are fed up with harsh treatment, and rises above such acts of brutality by showing who really is the strongest.Following Indian liberation in South Africa, Gandhi takes on a task that initially seems insurmountable; liberate the Indians of the oppressive British Empire, a challenge he accepts following his return home to India where he is recognized as a hero and a powerful figure. It is here when Gandhi decides to partake in a hunger strike, an action which is, essentially, being violent to oneself rather than a specific group of people. It is during is fight for India's independence that we, and Gandhi, for that matter, see just what he's made of and all he is capable of as a human being.An event of Gandhi's life that would've been fit for a film itself would've been the hunger strike, which crippled Gandhi and made him a skinnier soul than he already was. Such an event, like Nelson Mandela's prison sentence of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Selma protest, are events that would've made for fine, epic films benefiting from a concentration in a specific event. Gandhi's is a film that occupies a grand amount of space and a large amount of time, even boasting an intermission, and with all this time and ground to cover, inevitably, even if you don't know the entire story, you know that certain situations were truncated or lack the kind of development needed to make them more meaningful. While Attenborough slows the film down to assert Gandhi's religious devotion and his human qualities, he nonetheless makes the classic mistake of epics and biopics in that he tries to cover too much ground that even the liberal runtime of three hours and eleven minutes cannot do effectively.Starring: Ben Kinglsey, Rohini Hattangadi, and Roshan Seth.

30,sddavis63,This May Well Be The Best Bio-Pic Ever Made,10,26 January 2012,"Do not be put off by the length of this movie. At a little over 3 hours it is a rather long movie, but it's wonderfully made, surprisingly accurate and never dull. It also deals with one of the more fascinating figures in history - Mohandas Gandhi (or the Mahatma) - a Hindu disciple of non-violence and human equality who was one of the leading figures in the movement for the independence of India, and who - as many have suggested - was (even as a Hindu) a better disciple of Jesus' teachings than most professing Christians are. Gandhi is a fascinating character, and a wholly appropriate subject for a film of this length and depth.I give credit to Richard Attenborough, who was both the director and the producer of this film. In an opening written message, he acknowledges that no movie can do justice to a man's entire life, and that his hope is to be able to offer at look at the heart of the man. In that he succeeded admirably. After the shocking opening sequence that depicts Gandhi's tragic assassination at the hands of a Hindu militant who objected to his attempts to reach out to Muslims, we are transported immediately to Gandhi's early career in South Africa. Arriving as a lawyer to assist in a case, he's introduced immediately to the racial realities of South Africa, and he becomes a leader in the struggle for racial equality in that country (at the time, a part of the British Empire.) At that point in his life, Gandhi is a figure of a more cultured, upper-class Indian (or ""coloured"" in South African parlance) and he has a great commitment to the British Empire and a pride in being a citizen of the Empire. He trusts the Empire and its system to look out for his people's interests. He also works out his essential philosophy of non-violent resistance in South Africa. The South African part of the movie is a backdrop to the more important story of Gandhi's work in India, but it's vital to understanding who he was - and who he became.Gandhi arrives in India just at the beginning of the First World War - at a time when the movement for an independent India was just getting off the ground. He becomes committed to that cause, and increasingly disenchanted with the British authorities, but always remains a disciple of non-violence. He associated with the lowest of the low - the ""untouchables"" of the Hindu caste system (even dressing like them, or even more modestly than them) - and he tries to maintain unity and friendship between Hindus and Muslims, believing both to be essential to India's future. In India we see his campaign of non-co- operation with the British, which tragically dissolves into violence toward the British (which is only stopped when Gandhi goes on a fast, vowing to starve unless peace is restored) and then we get a fair bit of background about the Salt March, as Indians join with Gandhi to illegally make salt in their own country - where salt was under a crown monopoly.Finally, the movie portrays the debates around Indian independence, and the ultimate tragedy of a divided India rapidly dissolving into religiously motivated violence, as the country ends up divided between Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan, before finishing once again with the portrayal of Gandhi's assassination.One might quibble, I suppose, with the casting of Ben Kingsley as Gandhi rather than using one of the many very talented Indian actors in the role, but clearly Hollywood wanted a ""name"" - someone familiar to American audiences. And even if one quibbles with the choice of Kingsley, one cannot quibble with his performance. He was perfect in the role; he became Gandhi in this picture. Indeed, as Attenborough suggested was his goal at the start of the movie, Kingsley captured for us the heart of the man. The other performances faded into the background in comparison with Kingsley's. I was a bit surprised by (of all things) the credits that rolled at the end of the movie. Actors who played (in the overall scheme of things) minor characters (like Americans Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen and Brits John Gielgud and Trevor Howard) were given credit ahead of the actors who played truly important figures such as Nehru (Roshan Seth) and Jinnah (Alyque Padamsee). I found it a bit disturbing (and perhaps not in keeping with the heart of Gandhi) that the ""ethnic"" actors who were truly central to the story seemed to be given second place behind American and British actors in lesser roles.I can't really bring myself to mark the movie down for that indiscretion, though. This is a marvellous movie - possibly the best bio-pic ever made. (10/10)",Gandhi
31,Lejink,Workmanlike biography of India's great religious leader,6,26 March 2008,"I'm relatively unfamiliar with the history of Mahatma Gandhi's lifelong struggle to liberate India from the yoke of British colonialism and have since learned that this biopic plays somewhat fast and loose with the historical events and characters (particularly Nehru and Jinnah) along the way. That said, it's still an ambitious and admirable piece of film-making by Richard Attenborough even if not, in my opinion ultimately quite deserving of all the accolades it received at the time of its release. The cinematography is of the highest standard (eat your hearts out Merchant Ivory), the crowd scenes superbly handled and of course centring it all is Ben Kingsley's performance as the beating heart of the movie, moving the events forward as he matures from an idealistic young lawyer first learning to turn the other cheek of passive protest in turn of the century apartheid South Africa to later take on the stubborn remnants of the fading British Empire in his homeland to achieve his desired aim of independence just after the second world war. Perhaps a weakness of the film is that we only ever seem to get Gandhi's viewpoint of things, so that any contrary view to his is somehow demeaned and found wanting. This can't be right when one thinks of the conviction politics at play here particularly the religious differences which caused the India / Pakistan divide. There's also a possibly unavoidable tendency to sanctify Gandhi as he delivers homily, after edict, after platitude - he surely can't have been right all the time...and there's a bit of underpowered dynamism at key parts of the narrative. There also seems to me to be a little too much croney-ism in some of the casting although it was certainly a brave move to cast the little known Kingsley in the lead part. You could argue that the director's low-key approach better serves its serious purpose rather than a more Hollywood-type hyperbolic exaggeration but remembering that this is a movie entertainment and not a documentary, I still felt the malaise. The sheer length of the piece (even with intermission) again mitigates against the drama although again director Attenborough, obviously in thrall to his subject, possibly didn't want to short change Gandhi with just a two hour potted biography. All through this review in fact I'm apologising for the director, perhaps subconsciously venerating the subject matter too much myself. Gandhi's place in history however is secure and Attenborough's noble but slightly stolid film does nothing to detract from that. Whether the life of a religious leader or politician lends itself to great movie art is however debatable and ""Gandhi"" for me doesn't quite deliver enough as a film to convince me one way or the other.",Gandhi
32,ElMaruecan82,The triumph of a little man ... an inspiration for humanity ...,10,28 August 2011,"Albert Einstein said about Gandhi : ""Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood"".Well, I believe a soul so generous in goodness and capable of intelligent humility ever graced the face of the Earth and enriched our universal History's heritage, I sincerely do. But I can't admit that the last thing this great soul saw, was the face of hatred and violence, as the cruelly tragic destiny of a soul that was definitely too simply noble for our ""sophisticated"" comprehension of what is right or wrong. Maybe that's what Einstein meant : Gandhi, was good on a superhuman level.But that raises a puzzling issue regarding the Mahatma's posthumous aura. A man with his magnitude sure deserves to be venerated and honored by people from all over the world. However, this contradicts the conception that Gandhi had on his own person for he never felt like being special or above anybody, not even the untouchables. Cleaning the latrines was no less honorable than being an accountant and Gandhi rejected whatever would betray his background or social category in order to banish himself from premises of comfort and luxury and make one with his people. Gandhi's ascension to power ironically coincided with an extraordinary descent into the lowest depths of Indian population, at a time where 350 millions of Indians needed the light to guide them to the Independence.Richard Attenbough's Best Picture Winner could have been one of these epics that are more excuses to display cinematic grandeur with scenes of battles, inflamed speeches and cheerful cries, but the movie elevated itself from such clichés by centering the story on the man, more than the cause, making the cause no less inspiring. The psychological dimension of the Oscar winning script invites us to follow the birth of Gandhi's political conscience in South Africa and its evolution when he would rediscover his country, struck by poverty, and the shocking injustices of the British domination. Realizing that the education of Indian elites lead to an unfortunate ignorance of the real people's basic needs, Gandhi never left the ashram (community) and progressively became the iconic figure we're all familiar with, reassembling more and more disciples and followers, among them the Pandit Nehru and Mirabehn, a British woman who devoted her life for Gandhi, intriguing the skeptical Muslim leader Mohamed Jinnah and even the British enemy, but never without some unconscious fascination.""Gandhi"", as any epic, doesn't lack action and thrills, but they only serve as elements that will drive Gandhi's political beliefs or influence his decisions. Gandhi's determination and defiance toward the British will clearly be reinforced after the infamous Amritsar massacre, one of the most poignant and heart-breaking parts of the film. Most of the times, we're invited to meditate on Gandhi's thoughts, and on that level, the movie has a very interesting intellectual value, changing the image of pacifist that marked the card of Gandhi. In a simple but insightful scene, Gandhi, still a young lawyer, explains to a priest his view on 'turning the left cheek' as a self-defense move. For Gandhi, it's a sign of courage and resistance more powerful than the basic use of violence, and the active non-resistance revealed itself to be crucial in the extreme circumstances when violence was expected by the British as an alibi to justify their repression.In fact, the attitude preached by Gandhi is more provocative than any act of violence or terror. And when you extrapolate this idea to our current world, you realize how visionary was Gandhi. Not to say that violence was never necessary, but have the leaders who conquered the power through violence got rid of that deadly instinct? Gandhi knew it and foresaw great tragedies. ""An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind"" A sad prediction illustrated by the civil war that torn India apart. The late scenes provided some early hints of why a man like Gandhi would be killed by his own people. It's easier to set the fire of hatred and violence but it takes a greater deal of courage to extinguish it. Gandhi firmly believed in the coexistence between the Hindus and Muslim, and the worst that could've happened was the dislocation of the territory. I was particularly moved by the Civil War sequence, not just for the historical tragedy it represented, but because it illustrated that the cause Gandhi dedicated his whole life for, was being annihilated. I was sorry for Gandhi more than anyone, how ironic that the massacred also ceased for the sake of Gandhi.As usual, the movie absorbs you in its most serene moments. When the war stops, all of Gandhi's friends, surround his frail body begging him to stop his hunger strike. Gandhi often punished himself as if he felt responsible for his people, 'Bapu' was his nickname as he was the Nation's father more than symbolically. In a significant scene, Gandhi advises an Indian, devoured by the guilt of having killed a Muslim boy as an act of revenge, to find a boy and raise him as a Muslim. This is basically, how Gandhi would have raised his people. Still, Gandhi was a man of simplicity, and perfectly embodying the spirit of the Mahatma, the simplest and quietest scenes were the best, especially those involving his tender and respectful relationship with his devoted wife Ba who, inspired by Gandhi's dedication, followed him heart and soul. Speaking of soul, Ben Kingsley's perfect performance was the soul of this film, which is not one of the most inspirational biopics but also a remarkable achievement on the field of cultural knowledge.The philosophical heritage of Gandhi speaks to the whole world, for any country, at any time, and his tragedy was that his voice still fails to be heard, as it did in his own country ... but his combat is still our inspiration.",Gandhi
33,gbill-74877,Beautiful movie about a truly enlightened man,9,1 December 2016,"As Einstein said about Gandhi, a quote included at the end of this movie, ""Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever, in flesh and blood, walked upon this earth."" Critics of this film will say that's in part because of the mythologizing of Gandhi, which director Richard Attenborough contributes to by not showing us questionable aspects of Gandhi's personal life, or some of the opinions he held. Just one example of the latter was his very naïve attitude towards Hitler, which I chalk up to the limits of his idealism more than anything else, not evil on his part – but that would have been 'fair ground' for a more accurate and balanced portrayal of the man. However, I have to say, those who focus on these omissions miss all that was absolutely accurate – and truly inspiring – in the film. This epic movie has beautiful shots of India and is beautiful in spirit. Who can possibly not be moved by this great man, whose simplicity and nonviolent approach to oppression and violence inspired Indians and the world? He endures beatings without raising a hand, and his moral rectitude and dignity never waver in dealing with the British, his countrymen, and his peers in the 'Home Rule' movement. He eschews pomp, embraces poverty, and demands authenticity. In testifying in his own defense while on trial, he says simply ""Non-cooperation with evil is a duty, and that British rule of India is evil."" In speaking with British officials, he says ""In the end you will walk out, because 100,000 Englishmen simply cannot control 350 million Indians, if those Indians refuse to cooperate – and that's what we intend to achieve – peaceful, nonviolent, non-cooperation, until you yourselves see the wisdom of leaving."" He tries desperately to hold Hindus and Muslims together in the aftermath, but is frail and then is of course assassinated.Perhaps the most difficult to watch or even fathom is the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, which Attenborough shows us right before the intermission. The brutality and cruelty of British Colonel Reginald Dyer is staggering, as was his callousness in the inquiries afterwards – and there is no exaggeration in the film. There are aspects that can be questioned about the film – why a white man was hired to play the part of Gandhi (even though Kingsley is fantastic), why Jinnah was portrayed in too negative a light (possibly due to the influence of the Indian government, who helped sponsor the film), and why Gandhi was overly idealized. It's not perfect, and neither was he. However, the truth is that the man was courageous, enlightened, and an awe-inspiring moral beacon to us all. His words were beautiful – and the film gets all of this right. For companion reading, try 'Mohandas Gandhi Essential Writings', which has a number of fantastic passages, and provides a more complete view of the man. In the meantime, I highly recommend this movie. Just one more quote, in his speech in front of a packed house, which threatens to become violent in the face of unfair new British Laws:""In this cause, I too am prepared to die; but my friends, there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill. Whatever they do to us, we will attack no one, kill no one, but we will not give our fingerprints, not one of us. They will imprison us, they will fine us, they will seize our possessions, but they cannot take away our self-respect if we will not give it to them.  I am asking you to fight. To fight against their anger, not to provoke it. We will not strike a blow, but we will receive them, and through our pain, we will make them see their injustice, and it will hurt, as all fighting hurts. But we cannot lose. We cannot. They may torture my body, break my bones, even kill me – then, they will have my dead body – not my obedience.""Hallelujah.",Gandhi
34,g-bodyl,Intense Film About a Peaceful Man!,9,19 June 2013,"Gandhi is a sprawling, epic biography about one of the greatest, most influential leaders to have ever walked on our planet. That man was Mahatma Gandhi. He brought about the independence of India from the British Empire without enforcing the need for violence. He also wanted peace between all the Muslims and Hindus in India. This movie perfectly describes how Gandhi set to achieve his goals despite the British Empire trying to stop him.Richard Attenborough's film is about the life of Gandhi from his early adult life all the way to his brutal end. The way this man preached for peace and independence should influence all men and stop the unnecessary violence in this world.This film is very well-acted. I never thought a non-Indian like Ben Kingsley could pull off this kind of role off. But he did. Kingsley truly gave a magnificent performance and I felt like I was watching Gandhi himself. All the supporting actors were very good even though there are too many to list. A trivial fact for movie fans: Daniel-Day Lewis is indeed in this movie.Overall, this is one epic film about a man who united his country. This film has the essential cinematic qualities and it remains one of the top biographies ever made. The only thing that goes against this movie is the running length of over three hours long. But it was well-paced and has very powerful dialog. This film is a must-see for everyone. I rate this film 9/10.",Gandhi
35,kenjha,Lavish Biopic,8,9 August 2011,"This lavish production recounts the life and times of the great Indian leader over several decades. Attenborough tackles a biography of epic length and manages to make it interesting for the most part. Only in the final act, which focuses on the civil war between the Hindus and the Muslims, does the film run out of steam somewhat. Kingsley, who is half Indian, is nothing short of brilliant in the title role, providing an uncanny impersonation in terms of looks, vocals, and mannerisms of a man who espoused the power of non-violent resistance. In addition to Bergen and Martin as American journalists, the cast features cameos by a number of notable British actors.",Gandhi
36,tomgillespie2002,Occasionally plodding but anchored by a fantastic Kingsley performance,8,11 May 2015,"The late Richard Attenborough acknowledges the troubles with the biography genre from the get-go with his finest film as director, Gandhi. ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling,"" the opening credits state, ""what can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man."" Yet Gandhi manages to achieve more than most biography's by not only portraying the famous historical events that the man lived through, of which no doubt helped form his own ideals, but by showing us the real man behind the speeches and the fasting, who enjoyed spending time at peace with his loving wife or operating his spinning wheel.Wisely avoiding Mahatma Gandhi's early life, we are first properly introduced to the man as he rides a first-class carriage in South Africa. He is thrown off for being a non-white, even though he possesses a first-class ticket and is a practising lawyer, and this event provokes him to form a non-violent civil rights movement. Through sheer will and stubbornness, the government eventually relents and passes laws benefiting the residing Indians, allowing Gandhi to return to India in the process. When he arrives in his native country as a hero, he witnesses the same prejudicial brutality at the hands of the occupying British Empire. Through more non-violent protests, Gandhi manages to unite millions against the British, causing a divide between the Hindus and Muslims in the process.Gandhi was a labour of love for Attenborough, who fought for over a decade to get to the film made. Alec Guinness was rumoured to be set for the role of Gandhi when the movie was still in the hands of David Lean, and after seeing Ben Kingsley's portrayal of the great man, such an idea now seems utterly preposterous. Kinglsey's performance is without a doubt one of the finest embodiments of a public figure in history, not only settling for a good impression and an uncanny resemblance, but convincing to the point that you believe Gandhi himself is on screen. It's a quiet, dignified performance, often channelling Gandhi's gentle charisma, shrewd wit and fierce intelligence without saying anything at all.For all it's technical impressiveness - the film is undeniably beautiful, shot with a grandiose David Lean-esque epic feel with extra's numbered in the thousands - it occasionally plods. Although the events in South Africa no doubt shaped Gandhi's attitudes and spirit, we spend far too much time there, and this doesn't allow the complex events in India to unravel with the time and care that they warrant. The aftermath of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the growing political and social unease between the Hindus and Muslims, and the events that led to Gandhi's assassination are all rushed over the finish line. Without these flaws, Gandhi may have been a masterpiece. However it is still an enlightening experience, and the praise lavished upon Kingsley (as well as his Oscar) is wholly justified.",Gandhi

The direction which was made by Richard Attenborough, it was simply amazing and he succeeded on creating a bond between the audience and his main character that made more clear not only the plot but also the true meaning of the movie. The interpretation of Ben Kingsley who played as Mahatma Gandhi was simply outstanding and I believe that he made one of his best interpretations. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rohini Hattangadi's who played as Kasturba Gandhi and Candice Bergen's who played as Margaret Bourke-White. Lastly, I have to say that ""Gandhi"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure it will change or make you think about Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy and life in general.",Gandhi

There's also a brief early appearance from Daniel Day-Lewis as the chap who hassles Gandhi for walking on the pavement in the company of the white reverend.A lengthy film and one which, of necessity, focuses on the politics of the time and the liberation of a state under the thumb of imperialist rule; but 'Gandhi' doesn't shy away from showing its subject as a human being and a man of integrity.",Gandhi
39,johnnyboyz,"Sound and diligent recounting of the life of a certain legendary free-thinker; what the film lacks in certain departments, it makes up for in scope and emotional involvement.",6,29 August 2011,"The opening titles of Richard Attenborough's patchy, but irregardless rather accomplished, 1982 biopic Gandhi, a film detailing that of the famous titular Indian, outlines that it doesn't believe a text, indeed a retelling, of his life, through whatever means, ""....will ever amount to what is most definitely required to do justice to what he achieved"". Fittingly, the opening captions are kind of on the right tracks from the get-go; the film an interesting in-its-own-right recounting of what a lowly attorney managed to achieve through the ages, but a piece that is never much more than rather interesting and never an awful lot worse than somewhat curious. The film's consummate direction patches over what little-narrative and minuscule character study it actually has going on, but what a directorial feat: The film's evolvement, for the most part, into this power struggle between Gandhi and the millions of Indians against the British Empire comes at us as this slow slog through a mire of animosity that does not allow advance. Translated to the screen, this premise happens to move quite briskly and with pace and engagement; a far cry from the pain and frustration felt by those within.The bagginess of its inability to tell a proper story, more-so a dapper retelling, is rarely more than evident during its closing acts, during which the film is so eager to recount mostly everything in terms of ground covered, that it swoops through not only the dissolution of the British Raj, but the forming of the independence of what is now India; the birth of the nation of Pakistan; how it was these events were influenced by the Second World War's conclusion and the infamous moment of Gandhi's actual assassination - each of which unravel in barely that of twenty or so minutes after two hours plus of progressive episodes in the lead's life. On the other hand, critical reaction citing the film for moving too slowly be damned; at least for its final curtain sprint.Where the biographical qualities of the picture hold up to varying degrees of success, there is a gnawing sensation born out of its repetition to get across precisely what it was the man stood for: change and independent movement through the spoken word, and not force. This is inherently evident when the film no longer has an awful lot left to depict on the side of Gandhi's tale, and instead beds down into that neat groove of what is essentially a power struggle between ruling British forces, and their violent ways, and Gandhi's voice of independence played out through that aforementioned spoken word. It is Ben Kingsley bringing to life that of the great man of the last century or so; the film beginning with his death, consequent funeral and then a radio broadcaster reiterating to us, the listening audience, what we ought to know straight off of the bat. His death, we knew of; the sadness enveloping this newfound nation, we were aware of – the rest of the film, following this verbal confirmation, an historical retelling of all those things we perhaps lived in ignorance of.People misunderstood, indeed underestimated, Mahatma Gandhi from what appears a very early stage. His raucous with a train guard in 1893 South Africa over a first class compartment dwelling is a happening born out of the fact they doubted a black individual would even have Gandhi's then job, something highlighting not only the raging jingoism rife throughout the colonies but the sense of conflict and racial tension that seemingly travelled with Gandhi throughout. When he reaches his employer following this train journey, and occupies a lush office full of suited men, we witness Gandhi moving around; pacing; contemplating and seemingly always active – a picture of ideas and movement and something contrasted by everyone else's very passive, very still demeanour as they sit or stand and proceed.Things press on and this marginalist attitude to those of differing races does not cease; a routine demonstration-come-public speaking routine in broad day light of little significance quickly mutating into a brawl involving local police officers and a silencing of the voice. Gandhi shifts more predominantly into politics, or motivational speaking, following some gained ground out of his South African exploits; a travelling to an India he states he ""knows little of"" his next port of call. India, or the British Raj, is firmly in the grip of the imperialist attitude of colonial Britain - the man's mission to seemingly transfer beliefs and writings on what he's to the here and now so as to quell some of the marginalisation rife throughout the Providences. There is an early instance seeing him talk in a Colosseum-like locale to an audience made up of many individuals. They are of a Muslim, Hindu and policing variety, but are essentially representative of those he is charged of bringing together as they sit there uneasily in their own little sects. His journeying through this field is punctuated by that of the appearance of Martin Sheen's character, an American journalist named Vincent Walker; a man whom cannot even pronounce Gandhi's name at the beginning of his tours but comes to enthusiastically shout reports and such down phone lines post-Gandhi speeches. The film is no doubt worthy in its painting of a portrait of a man inclined to get an awful lot done in the smartest; most diligent and, indeed, eloquent of manners – those of whom know only of violence, encapsulated by the higher-ups of the empire, are more often than not represented by the drones out on the front-line barking and squabbling with locals sick of their presence. The film accomplished without being an overtly stunning piece of drama; instead, a diverting yet consummate film doing its material justice in the most applied of fashions.",Gandhi
40,Red-125,Outstanding depiction of Gandhi and his time,10,2 January 2016,"Gandhi (1982) was directed by Lord Richard Attenborough. It stars Sir Ben Kingsley as Rohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi. This is a superb film, which I saw when it was released, and which I've just seen again on DVD.Director Attenborough pulled out all the stops when he cast this film. We see such actors as Trevor Howard, John Gielgud, John Mills, and Martin Sheen. However, the film is called Gandhi, it's about Gandhi, and everything depends on the actor playing Gandhi. Luckily for us, Attenborough cast Ben Kingsley in the lead role. He's a great actor, he's on the screen most of the time, and he's outstanding. Watching this movie is an experience that makes you ask, ""How does he do it."" How can an actor embody a role in such a way that you think you are watching Gandhi himself, and not someone playing Gandhi in a movie? You'll have to ask Ben Kingsley, because I certainly don't have the answer. This is a long film, shown in theaters with an intermission. It's noisy, colorful, and sometimes violent. This works well for us as viewers, because we are watching a movie about a noisy, colorful, and sometimes violent time and place.Attenborough wasn't perfect. I think he wasted the talents of Geraldine James as Mirabehn, a woman who left her upper-class English life to become Gandhi's disciple. We see her often enough, but usually she is in the background, putting a cool compress on Gandhi's brow, or giving him his first bites of food after he has been fasting. She's not given a chance to show herself as a three-dimensional character. Candice Bergen plays the famous photographer Margaret Bourke-White. It's true that Bourke-White took iconic photographs of Gandhi, but when she shows up in the film, she appears to have wandered onto the wrong movie set. It's as if the script said, ""Bourke-White arrives, looks beautiful, takes some photos, looks beautiful again, and then leaves."" She received co-star billing, when she really had just a cameo role. It doesn't hurt to be famous and, well, beautiful.This is a movie that you should not miss. If you saw it when it was released, it's worth seeing again. ""Gandhi"" has stood the test of time, and it doesn't have an outdated feel to it. A movie of this type was made to be shown in a theater, and that's where it will work best. However, it works very well on the small screen. Just don't miss this outstanding film.",Gandhi
41,filipemanuelneto,One of the best films of the eighties.,9,24 August 2016,"This film tells the life of Gandhi, a highly intelligent lawyer of British origin, which joins the Indian independence cause and plays a key role in the independence of India, after decades under British rule. Directed by Richard Attenborough, it has a screenplay by John Briley and stars Ben Kingsley in the lead role.The film is quite honest in the picture that makes of the life and struggle of Mahatma Gandhi, father of modern India. He is portrayed as an idealistic, utopian, combative and determined to achieving his objectives in a way that he considers appropriate, without resorting to expedients that he knows are not right. An icon of passive resistance and nonviolence, Gandhi is played brilliantly by Ben Kingsley, who managed to live up to the role, giving the character a great moral force. The film catapulted him to stardom in all fairness, after a great character reconstruction work (physical, mental and psychological) along several stages of his life.The film is a classic with classical techniques. No complex special effects or anything like that. The crowds that come in some scenes, such as Gandhi's funeral, are made from real people. An effort partially forced by the absence of cheaper techniques, but compensated by giving a striking realism to the film. This realism efforts found following in costumes, filming locations and sceneries, creating an environment that transports us easily to the time and place of action. In fact, this film could almost be a documentary about Gandhi and the life and society of the British Raj era. The soundtrack is signed by Ravi Shankar, but its far from the impact and relevance of other soundtracks. Anyway, the film reached a deserved consecration, raising eight Oscars (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing and Best Costume Design).",Gandhi
42,SAMTHEBESTEST,Hollywood takes Outstanding Care of One of India's Most Popular Personality ever.,8,19 May 2020,"Gandhi (1982) :
Brief Review -Hollywood takes outstanding care of One of India's Most Popular Personality ever. Sometimes Hollywood fails to take care of some other country's Personality and Culture, sometimes it's Bollywood and Indian Cinema failing to take care of British or American culture. You know I was afraid of watching this film because i am an Indian and I have been reading a lot about Mahatma Gandhi since childhood, therefore the doubt of the same cultural issues might just spoil it. Gratefully, nothing sort-of that happened. Richard Attenborough took his time time to make this biopic and he did just fantastic job. I am short of adjectives at the moment but i guess Just Fantastic tells pretty much about it. Just First 10 minutes into the film and i was sure that i am into a classic storytelling. The first scene itself has so many emotions. The dialogues are so powerful that i feel like hearing probably the best dialogues ever for any biopic. The locations, the set decoration, the background score, the cultural influences, the costumes, the overall designing of the film proved out to be a lesson for filmmakers. You see the film begins in late 19th century and travels through almost half of the 20th century but the ideology of mainstream filmmaking never lets you notice any changes in the narrative even of there have been many changes. That's quite like hypnotism. Ben Kingsley gave a memorable performance. At least i am not gonna forget this act in my life. Most of the roles are portrayed by Indian Actors to bring more conviction and it works as it was supposed to. You may be a Gandhi Lover or his hater but this film can't be hated at all. I am very glad that Hollywood did a biopic on an Indian personality and they did it so incredibly that Indian Cinema could have never done it. This is a Must See for every Indian and others as well to know more about Mahatma Gandhi. It deserved all those 8 Oscars infact it deserved more but limited access to other characters spoiled it.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Gandhi

44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Gandhi"" allows room for the power of its title character to captivate",9,27 May 2010,"Not often does an Oscar winner for leading actor or actress dominate the entire picture through and through. Everything in ""Gandhi"" gravitates around Ben Kingsley in the role of a lifetime, or quite simply: the role he was born to play. Mahatma Gandhi's story is about the power of one influencing the power of millions. Richard Attenborough's film aspires to spread that message in this fascinating three-hour biopic about the strength and willpower of the human spirit.""Gandhi"" is in fact responsible in part for the modern day biopic, a genre that has become a huge part of awards season almost every year. Humbly, the film begins with a message that no film could fairly capture the life of one person, let alone Mohandas K. Gandhi, the lawyer that virtually became a prophet. They needn't be so humble: they easily achieve the goal of capturing the essence of Gandhi, the core of his person. The film starts with Gandhi making political waves in South Africa then taking his message of non-violence and non-resistance to India in attempt to force the English out on their own terms.Attenborough, an actor who had made a couple war films and a Winston Churchill biopic ""Young Winston"" prior, struck gold with this film. It is not a film that begs a director's signature touches, rather one that requires patience and the ability to surrender the film's influential power completely to the main character. With the exception of some key scenes that don't involve Gandhi, Attenborough is nearly invisible. We're meant to hear this man's words and become as magnetized as all South Africa and then of course India does. Attenborough primarily contributes a worldly feel, like that of a true epic, as well as purposeful and quick pacing.Ultimately, writer John Briley keeps ""Gandhi"" fascinating by bouncing back and forth between plan and action. Gandhi and his followers or Gandhi and the government meet to discuss how they might make a stand, Gandhi says some instantly-quotable wisdom and then we see the impact on the greater country. It seems formulaic, but it keeps ""Gandhi"" from lingering too long in one place and losing its impact.Holding those ""planning"" scenes is the poise of Kingsley. He has that intangible ""it"" factor as Gandhi. Gandhi was well-spoken, strong-willed and never doubted his position of influence, but he had to have been more humble than any man before him with that kind of political influence. Many Oscar winners have the inner demons of their character to wrestle with in order to add power to their performances; Kingsley does it all gracefully and understated.The difference one man can make in the cycle of violence has never been clearer. Martin Luther King Jr. would become the ""next Gandhi"" perhaps, adapting his principles and continuing to prove that a single voice can lead a people as it has as far back as biblical times. Humanity needs a face to help rally it sometimes and Gandhi was able to fast to quiet a nation of 300 million (at the time). In exploring the power of this one Indian man of short, unimposing stature, ""Gandhi"" offers discourse on the dynamics of power between oppressor and oppressed and also highlights that despite how easily one single person can start the cycle of violence, say by throwing a rock at a passing group of Muslims as one Hindu does later in the film, one person -- contrary to popular belief -- can under the right circumstances end it.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Gandhi
45,funkyfry,solid history lesson,8,31 May 2009,"Had never seen this movie until this week, probably because I suspected it would just be one of those sanctimonious emotional films that feels more like an advertisement for a political figure than a real movie with actual characters. But I was really pleased with the way that the director and Kingsley managed to make Gandhi into a real flesh and blood human being, one who we could admire without feeling that he was remote or too perfect for reality. It was Gandhi's humility that really got to me, how when the Martin Sheen reporter character told him he was an ambitious man he said, ""I hope not."" Of course I couldn't have spent all these years talking and reading about film without hearing the Legend of Ben Kingsley. That he was so great in this movie, that it was one of the best performances, etc. But at least up until I saw ""Sexy Beast"", I had never really been impressed with him as an actor. I doubted his ability to restrain his energy, even (or especially) after ""Beast."" But ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't have been more wrong. He's wonderful in the role and watching him is a delight in and of itself. The Indian actors who play in support roles are also really excellent, and I especially enjoyed Roshan Seth as Nehru and Rohini Hattangadi as Gandhi's wife. I think they should have been billed higher, but whoever was paying for the movie obviously felt like they needed Candice Bergen's name up there as if to tempt the audience with sex appeal. Bergen adds almost nothing to the movie with her typically cardboard performance, and Geraldine James is barely an actress at all.I wouldn't say it's a really great movie overall though. The style that Attenborough uses is exceptionally dry and straightforward. I don't think a director with more ""flourish"" would necessarily have made a better film, and in fact it would have been a huge risk, but it kept the movie from being what it could have been as a piece of cinema. Compare it to David Lean's style in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or Edward Zwick's style in ""Glory"" and it seems a bit dull. The other thing was that it seemed like the screenwriters had gone to great efforts to make sure that there were white characters on screen at all times. It seemed very contrived to me, having this whole scene where Gandhi tells the priest (Ian Charleston, who was also scandalously under-billed considering the importance and quality of his performance) that he has to leave because whatever is done must be done by Indians, and then there's really no explanation as to why he's bringing this British woman to India to help him take care of his house. Then just as the movie is coming to a close, we have Candice Bergen strutting around flirting with Gandhi and it sets a very odd tone to some scenes that probably could have been done better with a more serious actress. You have John Gielgud in a role that could just as easily have been played by just about anybody. So there's a lot of wasted talent in a sense, and all these actors getting top bill over some of the people who had real roles in the film leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. Not enough however to really over-ride my overall enthusiasm for this film, which has a handful of really exceptional scenes at least to make it worthwhile. At the very least, it made me want to learn more about Gandhi, who I never had much interest in as an esoteric religious leader but who seems much more interesting as a human being.",Gandhi
46,Vartiainen,Almost more about India than it is about Mahatma Gandhi,8,15 December 2018,"Mahatma Mohandas Gandhi is one of those giants of history everyone with even a basic education knows about. To quote this very movie, it is impossible to know anyone through a single story, but at least we now have this film to help us get started or to round out the picture we already have from our history classes.The film follows Gandhi throughout the years. From his early days as an attorney in South Africa, fighting against the unfair treatment of Indian workers, to his assassination in India during the first years of its newly won independence. The film focuses heavily on his personality and his philosophy against violence, but also against blind obedience.As to the genre of the film, it is very much an epic, placing it in the same group alongside such films as Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur. Both of those are much older, but the scope is the same. Decades of time pass while we focus on a single person, around whom whole empires shake. Plus, it's running time is epic as well.Not that the film feels like it's over three hours long. When the intermission rolled around, I was honestly surprised that bit over hour and a half had already passed. The movie has this gift of pulling you in and making you care about each individual moment. The film is always moving forward, even when nothing much seems to be happening.It is a great film about a fascinating person, quite unlike anyone else that has ever lived. Recommended seeing for just about anyone.",Gandhi
47,bsmith5552,A Deeply Moving Film!,9,13 December 2019,"""Gandhi"" is the story of Indian legend Mohatma Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) and his non-violent crusades for the rights of Indians in South Africa and his fight to gain independence for India from English colonial rule. It covers the period in Gandhi's life from 1893 to 1948.The 190 minute film is divided into two parts. Part I deals mostly with Gandhi's time as a lawyer in South Africa. It starts with his being literally thrown off of a train for doing the unspeakable thing of travelling in a first class compartment. He immediately takes up the cause fighting for equal rights for Indians which he achieves over the ensuing twenty years.Becoming somewhat of a legend back home, he is asked to take up the cause of obtaining India's independence from England. This fight takes up Part two of the film. He meets firm opposition from the British to the point that he winds up being thrown into prison many times. He goes on lengthy fasts to bring home his point of non-violence. Unfortunately, some violent happenings occur. The Amritsar massacre of 1919 results in several hundred Indian protestors being slaughtered. Another event occurs when police brutality results in a revolt against authority.Violence among the Hindus and Muslims follows and seems unending until Gandhi mounts a long fast to the point of near death. Finally, he achieves his goal and sections of land are ceded to the Muslims in what now is known as Pakistan. India is granted it's independence from England in 1947 and becomes a full member of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Unfortunately, dissidents assassinate the elder statesman on January 30, 1948.Director Richard Attenborough gives us a grand scale of the life of this great man. He populates his cast with several veteran and new performers. Ben Kingsley, who was largely unknown internationally, gives a mesmerizing performance as Gandhi. He was so convincing in the role that several native Indians saw him as a second coming. Rohini Hattangadi as Ghandhi's wife is equally outstanding.Also in in the cast in roles of varying sizes are: Candice Bergen as Life reporter Margaret Bourke-White, Edward Fox as General Dyer the perpetrator of the Amritsar Massacre, John Geilgud, John Mills, Trevor Howard, Ian Bannen, Michael Hordern and Nigel Hawthorne as various authoritive figures, Ian Charleson as Charlie Andrews Ghandi's cleric co-patriot, Martin Sheen as a New York reporter and Geraldine James as Mirabehn an admiral's daughter who joins Ghandhi's crusade and becomes his adopted daughter.Also watch for Daniel Day-Lewis as Colin the youth who confrons Kingsley and Charleson in South Africa and John Ratzenberger as Bergen's driver.A magnificent film.",Gandhi
48,runamokprods,A good film about a great man,8,26 June 2011,"If only the film was a little deeper, a little more complex, it could have been an all time great epic. As it is, it comes close. The pluses; the power of the story and the history, and Ben Kingsley's amazing performance, which, somehow, like Gandhi himself, is both modest and incredibly powerful. The minuses; many of the supporting characters are underdeveloped, sometimes to the point of caricature. Most of the 'villains' (the British, the leader of the Muslim separatist movement) are presented as one dimensional cartoons that Gandhi himself probably would have disapproved of as lacking compassion and understanding. Also, there's a feeling, despite it's 3+hour length, that we really never get to know Gandhi as a human being, not just a ""great, historic figure"". The best moments in the film are his moments of self-doubt and questioning, as well as his complex family life, but those are few and far between. Still, an epic telling of one of the most important, influential and inspiring people of the last 500 years.",Gandhi
49,FilmCriticLalitRao,What is the best method to judge this film's popularity ?,1,14 February 2008,"There is no doubt that this motion picture about Gandhi will always remain a monumental achievement for two Englishmen namely its director Sir Richard Attenborough who despite utter lack of assistance and cooperation from successive Indian governments,doggedly pursued an obsessive idea of making a film about one of the most famous Indians ever known to mankind and unknown actor Ben Kingsley who plays his part with such great perfection that people who personally knew Mohandas Gandhi claimed that they have seen a reincarnation of Gandhi in him.These facts are the only positive aspects of this film as its importance has never been properly assessed in India,a land where Gandhi was born.Each Indian viewer is familiar with the fact that this film is shown every year on 2nd October on India's national television network as a holy ritual to make people aware of this great man's importance.This proves that this film's popularity means different things to different viewers.For a non Indian it is a great visual document about Gandhi whereas for Indian people,it remains by and large a work which they are forced to watch out of compulsion for their country.It is also interesting to note that since some years Gandhi has become a fashion statement for Indian people.This is the reason why at least three films have been made in recent past by Hindi filmmakers about him.This was not happening around 1982 when this film was released globally.Would some serious viewer take a note of this anomaly ?",Gandhi
50,CubsandCulture,You don't have to know the history to get something from this film.,10,22 January 2019,"While I am sure there are inaccuracies the screenplay of this film does a remarkable job of explaining the political landscape of India. The Hindu-Muslim split is apparent from the opening scenes and the film effortlessly orientates the viewer to the various fractions. The resulting film is long, slow but deeply engrossing. Further, the screenplay, perhaps too little, does show Gandhi as a human being with foibles and limitations. In particular a scene where he is asked what about Hitler really presses his philosophy. A weaker film would not have had those tensions. While the films glorifies Gandhi it does so in a tasteful way. It is also nice to see a British co-production not sugarcoat the British atrocities against India all that much. The story seems fair to all those involved.The technical aspects are first rate. The cinematography, especially, as an exotic and spiritual edge to it. The final shot of the film is heartbreaking in its beauty. Likewise, the scope of the story is handled very well by the director and editor. The film is sprawling. It isn't however a mess. There is also a sense of forward movement and there are the required pauses for the more spiritual aspects of the film.Obviously,Kingsley is astounding in the title role. He somehow manages to capture the essence of Gandhi without doing a mere impression. The scenes when Gandhi is fasting are especially engaging. I also like how Kinsley and the visuals leaned into Gandhi's small statue. If nothing else Kinsley is the beating heart of this epic.I am glad I re-watched this. It got better with age.",Gandhi
51,MaxBorg89,"Conventional but solid biopic, with an immortal central performance",8,23 April 2008,"Lawrence of Arabia, Amadeus, Bird... those biopics just can't be under two hours, can they? Not that there's anything wrong with that: those three films are all masterpieces, justly revered by film-lovers of all ages and origin. Gandhi does not really qualify as a masterwork (it does have a few defects), but it's consistently interesting and well acted, to the point you won't even notice it's over three hours long.As is expected, the movie starts at the end: while greeting a crowd of followers, Mahatma Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) is assassinated by a fanatic. As the funeral starts, director Richard Attenborough takes us back in time, so we can witness the man's career: from the time Gandhi, a newly appointed lawyer, was thrown off a train, to his decision to boycott English rules in a non-violent way, his entire life is shown to the audience, with particular focus on his struggles with British authorities (Trevor Howard, John Mills, John Gielgud) and his relationship with an American journalist (Martin Sheen).The long running time is justified by Attenborough's need to tell a complete story, one he planned to make for decades before someone actually agreed to produce the project. The time he spent waiting was well used, though: he got to meet and cast Kingsley, who delivers a powerhouse turn - quiet, calm and wise, he is so reminiscent of the real Gandhi it's no wonder the film's Indian extras believed the actor to be the Mahatma's reincarnation. But the film isn't a mere one-man show: the supporting cast is superlative (Gielgud especially), and the wonderful cinematography and locations do nothing but confirm the director's passion for the subject.However, it is absolutely clear Attenborough's utmost respect for Gandhi prevents him from doing something really extraordinary with the film. Don't get me wrong, it never becomes boring, it's just that at times the direction is too by-the-book to make the picture any different from a standard biopic. There is also the slight problem of Kingsley having some initial trouble to fully convince as the aged Mahatma, but that's a minor issue that is quickly forgotten.Still, the movie deserves its high reputation and most of the Oscars it won. Calling it the best film of 1982 is a bit of a stretch, though, a fact even Attenborough has acknowledged (he reportedly took the role of Hammond in Jurassic Park because he felt bad about stealing the top prize from E.T.). Kind of overrated, then, but quite worth your time.",Gandhi

55,gcd70,Most Important Drama,9,27 June 2008,"For the sheer impact that the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi had on the world, Sir Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi"" must be one of the most important dramas ever made.From the ground up this is both a labour of love and a technical masterpiece. Billy Williams and Ronnie Taylor's majestic photography captures mother India with aplomb, costumes from the period are near faultless, art director Stuart Craig recreates scene after scene unerringly, and John Bloom's editing leaves the final cut with a perfect weight, balance and momentum. All of the afore mentioned won Academy Awards, whilst sound, makeup and music (Ravi Shankar, and an original score from George Fenton) received nominations.""Gandhi"" owes its excellence and extreme effectiveness to three things however. Sir Richard Attenborough directs with purpose, and I have already stated : this was obviously a labour of love. He has succeeded at what he set out to do, that is to show us the heart of the man who freed India from English rule (and from each other for a time) through a sheer act of will. Yet how could Sir Dickie miss. John Briley's screenplay was perhaps one of the best ever written directly for the screen. Truly he encapsulates everything that the Mahatma was, and everything he stood for. After viewing ""Gandhi"", one feels that one knew the man personally, thanks to Mr. Briley's script, whose depth is pervasive throughout.The cast are the final jewel in this brilliant crown. Very strong indeed are Edward Fox, as the apparently soul-less General Dyer, Roshan Seth as Gandhi's good friend Nehru - who becomes first Prime Minister of India - and Rohini Hattangady, especially memorable as devout wife, Mrs. Gandhi. Good performances come also from Geraldine James as adopted daughter/disciple Marabehn, Candice Bergen as Time photographer Margaret Bourke-White, Martin Sheen as New York Times reporter Walker, and Athol Fugard as General Smuts. Ian Charleson, Sir John Gielgud, Sir John Mills, Trevor Howard and Amrish Peru also star. All these players pale though in the light of one of the most complete characterisations ever to grace the screen. Ben Kingsley creates an amazing Gandhi. Both physically and actually, he brings the spiritual leader to life as no one could have believed possible. Kingsley portrays his compassion, stubbornness, boldness and true love for fellow man with a compelling turn. So good is his personification that he has even managed to adjust the little man's accent perfectly, taking it from the English influence of his education to the Indian of his latter days. Kingsley's Oscar for this outstanding showing was more than deserved. ""Gandhi"" also won for best picture and best director.An inspirational and immeasurably moving insight into the life of a man who knew so much about the truth. The Mahatma lived his life as Christ taught us to live. Gandhi showed compassion for the oppressed, yet would not raise a hand against his oppressors. His peaceful non-cooperation was both brave and the only true answer. Meeting violence with violence only breeds the same, and is never a solution. Mohandas K. Gandhi truly lived the scriptures: turn the other cheek and love thy neighbour as thyself.Thursday, June 12, 1997 - VideoThere are not enough superlatives to describe the high level of excellence in Sir Richard Attenborough's film ""Gandhi"", nor are there enough adjectives with which to outline its importance.Production values, from Stuart Craig's art, to John Bloom's editing, to Billy Williams and Ronnie Taylor's cinematography, all are superb. Ravi Shanker and George Fenton provide some ideal music, John Briley the perfect script, and Sir Richard controls proceedings with skill and purpose. Yet the most moving and effective contribution comes from the cast.Actors such a Rohini Hattangady (Mrs. Gandhi), Roshan Seth (Neru), Geraldine James (Mirabehn), Candice Bergen (Margaret Bourke-White), Martin Sheen (Walker), Edward Fox (General Dyer), Athol Fugard, Sir John Mills, Sir John Gielgud, Trevor Howard, Amrish Peru and Ian Charleson all make you believe you are witnessing history unfold. Cap this with perhaps the best performance by an actor in our generation (that of the brilliant Ben Kingsley) and you have a film that no responsible person should miss.So good was this rendering of the Mahatma's story, that no-one has tackled the topic since. No-one has needed to.Saturday, June 13, 1998 - Video",Gandhi

Sure Attenborough himself admitted ET was the better movie by miles, but Gandhi is a different kind of movie that is meant to give information and make people think, as Attenborough says ""a visual interpretation."" Either way, say this is boring or fun, everybody must admit how well-done this movie was. Maybe it was inferior to ET in some standards, but Gandhi rises above ET in the most. Sir Ben Kingsley is chilling to the bone as the Mahatma, giving one of the best screen performances ever. The way he walks, talks and behaves is so much like the real Gandhi that residents mistaken Kingsley for the real Gandhi. Some of his speeches are so fascinating and inspirational about freedom and unity, you know he deserved the Oscar win. Aside from Kingsley's acting and everybody else's acting. The general filming was monumental too, at David Lean and Cecil B. DeMille levels. Although this is inferior to those men's top works, Attenborough brings back that style just when we need it most. The movie may be boring as it suffers from a dragged excessive length that could easily be condensed, the sets and shots are very nice to look at.

Gandhi was murdered in 1948 by an Indian rebel, when he was going to make one of his prayers. This great and simple little man made the India Independent and was against all types of prejudices existent, since racial prejudice until the religion's one. He started his anger with the British Empire when he was going to South Africa, and was throw away from the train because he was in the first class, and the prejudice of that time could not allow any non white man,specially being Indian or black to have the same rights as the white men. From that time, until his death, he made people from India and the English to think about the prejudice and the fact that all people should have the same rights.

And the message passes through, of a life entirely dedicated to non-violent fighting for such noble causes as anti-racial discrimination and the right of all peoples to self-determination. His fight begins in pre-apartheid South Africa where nevertheless the roots of apartheid were already visible and continues in India for the independence of the country. There the story of his life mixes itself with the history of India. After defeating the British with his non-violent resistance deeds he faces another harsh trial: the rivalry between Muslims and Hindus which soon turns into violent hatred. He never wanted the former British colony to be divided between the two communities. By enduring a second hunger strike he tried to put an end to violence between them. He also fought against the division of Hindu society in castes. For him all men were equal regardless of race, colour or social status. He ended by being murdered by a fanatic Hindu when he was preparing himself to travel to Pakistan in order to reach reconciliation between both communities. The movie shows all these episodes with great realism and visual efficiency and the cast is formed by great players with special prominence of Ben Kingsley in the role of Gandhi. The ideas of the Mahatma were well and clearly expressed in the dialogues where he took part particularly when he had to talk with British authorities where his purposes were sharply and courageously exposed.

63,film-critic,"If you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.",3,8 January 2006,"Was Gandhi a great person? The answer will always be ""yes"". Was he a leader in a possibly violent country? This film shows the answer to be ""yes"". Did he deserve a three-hour epic devoted to his life and teachings? This cinephile believes so. Did director Richard Attenborough successfully give his audience an unbiased story of Mohandas K. Gandhi, which included a personal element, a patriotic element, as well as a historical element? Sadly, my response to this is ""no"". There is no doubt in my mind that Attenborough created a beautiful, picturesque view of India controlled by British rule and chose a subject very close to his heart. There is quite a bit of emotion behind the film itself, but I finished watching this picture with a feeling that I didn't quite know Gandhi himself. I knew the work that he had accomplished, the power behind his teachings, but who was this little man from India? That is where I thought Attenborough completely missed the opportunity in this award-winning film. He gave us the images and the one-sided history lesson, but he completely forgot to develop his main character. How did this win so many awards?I realize that the first paragraph of this review contains quite a bit of questions, but they were all questions that I had upon finishing this so-called grandiose epic. To begin, I do not believe that Ben Kingsley should have been awarded what he did for his role. He may have acted the part of Gandhi, but he (at least in my eyes) never looked the part. Here was a man who would stave himself for his people, but after such a long fast, Kingsley looked like he had just finished a couple of pizzas. I think I was expecting a sort of transformation as we saw Mr. Hanks do in Castaway, but alas, my ideas were quenched when Kingsley's belly bulged from his clothing. Also, who was this man? I saw so much passion in Kingsley when the film opened, but after that moment on the train, he seemed to be following his lines on script and leaving his true emotion to the curb. Was he the best actor for the role? I believe that he did a great job of ""acting"" like Gandhi, but I do not think he could be labeled as ""the best"". I needed more, sorry, meat to this character. I wanted to see Gandhi when he was in school, outside of the passive protests, with his family, but neither Kingsley nor Attenborough could give us this. I saw Gandhi on the screen, but that doesn't mean that I witnessed a true, strong, character-driven epic before my eyes. I saw beautiful pictures, but not enough about the beauty of this man.Attenborough has the tendency to build really strong biography epics. I enjoyed watching Chaplin, though I didn't think it was a powerful enough story on Chaplin himself, it was nonetheless enjoyable. I enjoyed watching Gandhi, but I just felt that Attenborough fast-forwarded through some of the most crucial elements to this monumental man's life. One of the scenes that I was most looking forward to was Gandhi's powerful pilgrimage to the Indian Ocean. I was ready for this emotional tearjerker that would eventually culminate into demonstrating the true power of this little man. What I instead witnessed was three minutes of Gandhi walking out of his village and suddenly making it to the ocean with no such sign of fatigue or strain. It was mere minutes, when it should have been a bigger scene in this story. That is where Attenborough went wrong. His attention to detail seemed flawed. He was focused on the bigger picture, thus forgetting the power of the smaller stories. A great biography will attempt to do both. It will show the power of this figure on a grand scale, but then zoom in closer to the actual person so that we can see the inner struggles they were facing on a daily basis. A film that correctly gives us this true mix is Nixon. Stone's biography picture does a great job in giving us the man and the nation that didn't stand behind him.Overall, I thought this was an enjoyable film to watch, but a horrid portrayal of this man's life. Throughout the film I continually felt pity for the British rule, and I am assuming that was not what Attenborough wanted to happen during this film. I wanted to see more behind Gandhi, more about the British rule (I do not believe they were as ""evil"" as depicted), and more about the people. I needed more information and less sweeping landscape images. There were even a couple of scenes where Attenborough had such great landscape happening that it covered up the words of Gandhi  is that how you build power towards this great man? I wish I could have seen more about the media coverage of Gandhi's life. While Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen were interesting in their own roles, I still felt as if they were so underdeveloped. There should have more connection between these active players and Gandhi. I continued to feel as if they slipped in and out of the scene as fast as Gandhi's ""quick"" pilgrimage. Gandhi is a man that deserves to have a motion picture devoted to him, I just do not believe that Gandhi was the film to best represent this powerful man's passionate mission! Grade: ** out of *****",Gandhi
64,blott2319-1,"Decent biopic, but tries to do a bit too much",6,20 February 2021,"In the opening of Gandhi, there is text on screen that says it is impossible to tell someone's entire life story in the runtime of a single film. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, and my first reaction upon finishing the film was ""Then why did you try?"" I've always leaned towards the kind of biopics that focus their efforts on a smaller time-frame or specific event in the subject's life. When you have something as broad and all-encompassing as Gandhi's entire political career, it starts to feel like a series of vignettes and lacks a strong narrative. Within less than an hour, I felt as though the character of Gandhi had been somewhat stripped of his more relatable human qualities and had become the Mahatma, a figurehead for this political movement. That might be a somewhat accurate reflection of what happened in his real life, but it takes away some of the power of this story for me. I want this amazing historical figure to be a man first, that I can relate to and empathize with, not just a symbol.All that being said, it's hard to deny that Gandhi tells an extremely compelling story. His journey to gain independence for the nation of India is fascinating. I love the power shown through his pacifism, and how he was able to find ways to calm some of the aggression even amongst his own people. Easily the most dramatic and impactful part of the film is when he goes on one of his most prolonged fasts, in order to calm the tensions between the Hindus and Muslims. It's kind of sad watching it now, and knowing that this is a religious war that still continues on to this day, and not in a non-violent fashion as Gandhi desired. Ben Kinglsey is perfect for the lead role in this biopic. And you have to commend the makeup team who did great work at making him look like he was growing older in a convincing fashion. While I am certainly impacted by the history of Gandhi, and I appreciate that this film tried so hard to tell it well, I think the filmmakers bit off a little more than they could chew effectively in only a few hours.",Gandhi
65,classicalsteve,How An Unassuming Little Man Without Title or Privilege Beat an Empire,10,27 September 2015,"If there is a figure who closely resembles the spiritual and peaceful role models of the past, such as Jesus of Nazareth, St. Francis of Assisi, and Frederick Douglass, in terms of both lifetime accomplishments and influence on later leaders protesting injustice, Mahatma Gandhi of India may be the most influential of such leaders in the 20th century. A famous photo of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., shows him standing next to a large portrait of Gandhi, who was King's primary inspiration in engaging in peaceful protest against racial injustice. The two never met, but without the peaceful protests largely instigated by Gandhi to compel the British to end their rule and leave India, the Civil Rights Movements in the United States would have been without a successful model.In the role of his career, Ben Kingsley offers a tour-de-force Academy-Award winning performance of a man who simply refused to acknowledge the British as the rightful rulers of India. He knew the only means to that ends would be non-violent protests, which he had done in South Africa a few years earlier. Gandhi, whose peaceful demonstrations violence were ahead of their time, showed the world that large change can happen but only if non-violence is at the core. Gandhi understood that only when the instigator of injustice inflicted blows upon defenseless people would they see the ultimate injustice of their laws and system. If they fought back, and sometimes they did, the cause would have been lost. Gandhi's use of non-violent protest to enact social change was later emulated by Martin Luther King, Jr., and Nelson Mandela. Gandhi remains the towering figure of a 20th century non-violent revolutionary.The film begins with the assassination of Gandhi in 1948 by a Hindu radical nationalist, who believed Gandhi had ""sold out"" the interests of Hindus in India during the breakup of India into India and Pakistan. The film then rewinds to the late 19th century. Little about Gandhi's early days prior to his arrival in South Africa could predict his later becoming part of two protest movements, one of which would lead to the ending of colonial rule of a European power in an Asian country. Gandhi was born in India, and educated in European-like schools, although his grades and test scores were passable but not outstanding. He was eventually educated in England as an attorney. The story of Gandhi's life begins with a trip to South Africa in the 1890's. Gandhi was called to South Africa for a case, and bought a first class ticket on a train in South Africa. Even Britain in those days did not have the kind of apartheid rules of South Africa, and when he's discovered in a first class compartment, he's asked to leave on grounds he's a ""darkie"", even though he's not technically African but Indian. Gandhi refuses, citing he had legitimately bought a first class ticket. As a result, he's thrown off the train, literally. He then learns of the strict apartheid rules of South Africa at the time, where those with dark skin were not allowed to walk on the streets alongside whites. In an interesting confrontation which doesn't escalate, Gandhi walking along with an Anglican priest, Charles Freer Andrews (Ian Charleson), are stopped by a group of uneducated white South Africans who begin name-calling and order the Indian to get off the street. (The most vocal of the hoods is played with startling realism by a very young Daniel Day-Lewis.) However, it's not just being able to walk the streets which infuriates Gandhi. Indians, even if they were brought up and educated in Britain, must hold passes, while whites from other places didn't have to. The government is even allowed to enter houses without cause. Gandhi then holds protests against the requirements on the grounds they are also citizens of the British Empire and should be treated as such. In one of the gatherings, he professes the use of non-violence and even ends the discussion by having the group sing ""God Save the King"".On a small level, his successful achievements in South Africa are acknowledged around the world, and he then returns to India. Even though he is an Indian by birth, he doesn't know the country well having left during his teens. Some of the leaders who wish to end British rule there convince him to use the same tactics which were successful in South Africa in India. He explores the country and learns about the economic injustices being enacted by the British, such as Indians being compelled to make certain goods which can't be sold, and then their white landlords demanding rent. He then organizes certain kinds of non-violent protests, such as days of prayer and fasting in which the working infrastructure of India begins to break down right before the eyes of the British leadership. But scattered incidents occur outside Gandhi's parameters of peaceful protest, and some British become victims of mob violence, contrary to Gandhi's intentions. The first half ends with the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre which occurred in 1919 when Reginald Dyer ordered troops to fire upon a group of peaceful gatherers who were listening to speeches because they had, according to Dyer, failed to observe the new martial law forbidding public gatherings. The incident devastates Gandhi who begins to doubt the movement.This is one of the greatest biographical films of all time. Richard Attenborough, director and producer, spent 20 years funding and finally producing the film. While Kingsley provides an astonishing and spiritual take on Gandhi, the supporting cast is no less than outstanding. Many name talent actors were involved, such as Ian Charleson (of Chariots of Fire fame), Martin Sheen, Trevor Howard, John Gielgud, and Candice Bergen. Honorable mention to Rohini Hattangadi as Gandhi's wife Kasturba and Roshan Seth as Nehru. During filming, some people sensed strange spiritual sensations as if benevolent forces from ""on high"" were aiding in the film's completion.",Gandhi
66,CitizenCaine,"Gandhi Above Average Story, Not Really A Biography",10,8 March 2009,"Much has been said about the historical inaccuracies of Richard Attenborough's Gandhi. However, many of the ""inaccuracies"" other viewers point to are merely personal idiosyncrasies of the man, not manipulated historical events. Should those idiosyncrasies have been included in a film about the one man who most influenced India's independence? Probably not. The film focuses on his motivations for and his contributions to India's struggle for independence, not really his own life. It took decades of his life to accomplish independence, so a three hour film to tell the story does not seem too long to me. From his days as a young lawyer thrown off a train to his rise as a nationalist leader of a India, Gandhi tells the story about how one man changed the world.Ben Kinsley in his first lead role is astonishing as Gandhi in appearance and speech and won a deserved Oscar. Ravi Shankar wrote the musical score, which was also nominated for an Oscar. The cinematography, costumes, and sets are first rate. The logistics of negotiating the crowd scenes must have been challenging to say the least compared to the new age of computer graphics. The film moves quickly, and it's compelling enough viewing to not seem like three hours. Attenborough, who won the Director Oscar, tried to make the film for some twenty years, but he was unable to secure financing until he started directing films himself more than a decade before Gandhi's release. One thing missing in the film is character development. Characters throughout the film enter and exit off the screen without much contribution to the story. None of the major actors mentioned in the credits has screen time of even a half hour. It's all Ben Kingsley as Gandhi. The film won eight of the eleven Oscars it was nominated for including best picture. Daniel Day-Lewis has a brief appearance as a young street tough who accosts Gandhi. **** of 4 stars.",Gandhi

De Niro in Raging bull and Steve Mqueen in Papillon spring to mind but in my opinion Ben kingsley's performance in Gandhi is even better. The film isn't better but the the performance is. The way kingsley goes from a young lawyer to a very old and withered man is remarkable. The film itself is good if not a little dated.

68,TOMASBBloodhound,A magnificent epic. Don't miss it.,10,28 November 2011,"First off, I'll start by saying that I'm always amazed to read about a great film having trouble raising money or getting studio support. Much like Dances with Wolves, Gandhi almost never came to fruition simply from a lack of funds or belief from the powers that be. I'm not surprised to read the Jake Eberts helped finance this as he as did with Dances, and Star Wars to name a couple others. Why is it so hard for a studio to imagine potential greatness and the spectacle of an epic done right? I imagine things are even worse now for anyone not pitching something involving a comic book hero, a flock of animated penguins, or a project not easily formatted for 3D. Thank goodness for Richard Attenborough and the countless others who worked together to make this unforgettable epic.There is not much more praise that is needed for this film. Ben Kingsley plays the man known to his people as the ""Great Soul"". A man who would shed light on the injustices imposed by the British Empire on their Indian subjects. For a time, he almost brought the empire to its knees. And he did it without striking a blow or publicly inciting others to do so. In some scenes where Gandhi hears of violence carried out by protesters loyal to his cause, he seems deeply hurt. Hurt that someone could do harm in his name. And once the British finally hand over India to its own people, Gandhi must face an even tougher task. How can he get Hindus and Muslims to live side by side in peace? This is something we still haven't figured out.At over three hours, this film never drags. There are plenty of violent scenes, but the intense dialogs between Gandhi and local rival factions are just as interesting. The film kind of subtly points the majority of the blame on the Muslim leadership, and not being a historian I cannot vouch for this. Maybe this was unintentional. Or maybe just my own observation. Kingsley is perfect. Just perfect. When you read some of the other actors being considered for this part, (Dustin Hoffman) you just cringe. How could they have done it without Kingsley? If you've never seen this film, then find it and do so immediately! Before you watch any other. And if its been a while, set aside some time on a weekend afternoon or whenever and see it again. It may even give you hope. Real hope. Not the kind today's leaders merely put up on a fancy poster. 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Gandhi

70,gab-14712,Powerful Movie About a Man with a Pure Heart!,9,26 July 2019,"""I am a Muslim and a Hindu and a Christian and a Jew and so are all of you.""-Ben Kingsley (as Gandhi).The above quote, spoken by Ben Kingsley in the 1982 drama Gandhi, shows what kind of man Mahatma Gandhi was. In a harsh world filled with violence and racism, this one man became a prophet, a messiah if you will. He wanted to change the world for the better using non-violent tactics. He wanted to use nonviolence to end segregation against Indians in South Africa, to end British rule in India, to create a peaceful country for Muslims in a country today known as Pakistan. Through his methods, Gandhi achieved what only most people dream of achieving in their lifetimes. He was a man for the people and no matter who the person is or what kind of religion that person believes in, he loved you no matter what. In this long, sprawling epic, you will become a believer of this spiritual man. At least I did. This is the kind of man that we need in our world today. A man full of hope, compassion, love, nonmaterialistic-just to name a few adjectives.Director Richard Attenborough had been wanting to make this film for decades prior to the films release. Attenborough had meetings set up with and approval from various key figures to make this film happen-but it was never meant to be at first. Also, David Lean wanted to make a film based on Gandhi's life after he completed production on The Bridge on the River Kwai, but instead went to work on Lawrence of Arabia. Later on, David Lean met with Attenborough and you can see his influence in this epic. I saw portions of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago at times. Once Attenborough was able to get funding from the Indian Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi- he was able to make the film he wanted. Attenborough was the perfect director for the movie. He wanted to create a grand epic, but one with the feeling of a smaller film. He didn't care too much about the landscapes or the scope of the film. All he wanted to do was focus on telling a careful, level-headed story about the person who changed the world for many-and he was able to do thanks to his sure-handed direction.The film starts in 1893 with a young lawyer named Mohandas K. Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) traveling first-class on a South African train. He was not aware of any segregation laws and thus was thrown off the train. To combat these laws, he starts a non-violent protest against segregation of Indians in South Africa. These protests led in many arrests and global attention for Gandhi, but he still achieved victory in the end. After he returns to India, he is asked to assist in the independence of India from Great Britain's rule. He agrees, but faces more issues such as imprisonment, violence against protestors, etc. But with England still suffering from World War 2, they granted India their freedom. However, there was still more work to do. There was internal conflict between the Hindus and the Muslims. Gandhi declares a hunger strike to stop these groups from fighting, in which he does eventually succeed. In addition to making many followers, Gandhi also made many enemies and that might make him a target.The role of Gandhi was played to utter perfection by a newcomer named Ben Kingsley. Kingsley, who had Indian descent, was able to create the mannerisms and the style that made Gandhi one of the most important, influential figures of the twentieth century. This is one of the best acting performances you will ever see. Love it or hate it, there is no denying the power of Kingsley's performance-which led him to claim the Best Actor Academy Award. The supporting cast does fill out nicely around Kingsley. There are some excellent British thespians such as John Gielgud and Trevor Howard. Some Americans- Martin Sheen and Candice Bergen deliver strong performances, although their characters were pushed away somewhat. Also, keep an eye out for young Daniel-Day Lewis!Gandhi is a spellbinding tour-de-force epic with a lead acting performance that perfectly captures the essence of one of the most beloved and influential historical figures. The lush cinematography by Ronnie Taylor and the stirring music by Ravi Shankar adds an ""epic"" feeling seen in films like Lawrence of Arabia, but Attenborough was able to perfectly capture the intimate character moments that we know this man of. Whether it is watching Gandhi suffer from his hunger strike or seeing his followers shot down by the British-there is no shortage of powerful scenes. The movie does clock in well over three hours and it can be felt at times, but in no way in this movie boring. It is a movie well-deserved of its Best Picture victory. To help see the good in themselves, this is the perfect movie to see.My Grade: A-",Gandhi

72,FilmOtaku,"Solid, but a bit unevenly paced",7,27 May 2004,"Attenborough's `Gandhi' is a solid biopic about the slain human rights leader, and Kingsley's acting job is unbelievably good.  There were times when I would be watching the film and would completely forget that this was an actor portraying the man, based on the few times I had seen film or photographs of the real man.  The cinematography is exquisite on this film, and reminiscent of David Lean's work, and the music is excellent  so much so that after sitting through over three hours of film I kept the credits rolling to hear the score.  However, even allowing for the sheer amount of information that had to be put into one single film, I feel that there were some important things that were glossed over, and other scenes that certainly could have been better edited.  Understandably, we first glimpse Gandhi as an attorney traveling to South Africa, where he first experiences the inequality that he chooses to spend the rest of his life fighting, but soon after, when he arrives in India, he is suddenly in the current dress of the poor.  Until then, he had certainly sacrificed, but he had gone from insisting that he `always travels first class' to this manner of self-sacrifice after he is released from prison without any background.  Perhaps surprise was Attenborough's intent, because that was my reaction.  On the other hand, there was a lot of time spent on moments that could have been pared down a bit in order to produce a more even pace  for example, some of the many meetings amongst Gandhi's `co-leaders'.  It was moments like these that made the film less compelling than I expected it to be  I am normally glued to my chair during just about any film, but I had no problem getting up for a moment or two because I suspected I wouldn't miss anything, which turned out to be a true assumption.These criticisms are fairly minor in the grand scope of the film  I knew nothing of this period of history and I felt like I learned some incredible facts and was able to of course correlate these with other historical events.  This was obviously a completely selfless man who died in an ironic manner after the sacrifices he and his family made in order to preach the virtues of non-violent protest.  While I admit that I was a little under whelmed because I perhaps had grand preconceptions, Gandhi is definitely a solid and important film.--Shelly",Gandhi
73,Atreyu_II,A biographical film that took decades to come true,6,14 August 2010,"'Gandhi' is based on Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's life (or simply Mahatma Gandhi), the tolerant man who wanted to make the world a friendlier place with his non-violent ways. How faithful the movie is to his biography, that seems to create mixed opinions. I will not go into that.This movie was directed by Richard Attenborough. Not only had this movie project been his dream, but also many years before it was made there had been 2 failed attempts to make it. Filming occurred between November 1980 and May 1981 but the movie wasn't released until 1982. It also happens to be an Indian British co-production.Ben Kingsley stars as Gandhi and he looks similar to him in this film. Ben Kingsley is partly of Indian heritage and his real name is actually Krishna Bhanji. So it wasn't all that necessary to select an Indian actor, even though they could have done that.I tend to avoid movies which are longer than 2 hours and a half. But I watched this one, thanks to a friend of mine who kept suggesting me to watch it. So I did it. But to avoid the experience from becoming too tiring, I watched about half of the movie first and watched the rest a few hours later. The movie seemed to become slower and I became more bored with it when I watched the rest of it, it just never seemed to end. Imagine if I had seen the whole thing without interruptions...It's nicely filmed and has a number of beautiful settings and backgrounds, but just that isn't enough to make a great movie. With all due respect for its fans, this ain't my type of movie. It's not that bad, but...Something curious was that this movie has an intermission that lasts about 2 minutes, somewhere near the 90th minute, just like in the film '2001: A Space Odyssey'.

Candice Bergen portrays Margaret Bourke-White, a highly respected and talented photographer, who was there to record parts of the drama for the world to see.

75,jdkraus,Almost perfect,9,7 June 2008,"For a long time I wanted to see this movie, but the rental stores doesn't have it, and it's always checked out at the library. This movie had to be either really good (since it's a winner of 8 Oscars) or my luck is short. Either way, I finally got a chance to see Gandhi. After seeing it, I can understand why it was always checked out of the library.I always found Richard Attenborough to be a good actor, but he's better at directing. He captures many wonderful scenes in this movie during Gandhi's life, particularly his thought-provoking speeches that left me speechless and the Amritsar Massacre that left me shocked. Not only did Attenborough's direction capture the film, but also with Ben Kingsley's performance. I've only seen him in two other films and he was great in both, but this is his trademark role. I did not see an actor, but Gandhi himself.In addition, the cinematography pulled me into the film with its beautiful colors and photography of the landscapes. The score (although small compared to John Williams for E.T.) adds a touch to the film's story as well as the Indian culture. The set-decoration and costume design makes an authentic look to the time period and location as well.But there's one thing that this film lacked, an emotional impact. I will admit that Ben Kingsley delivered lines that sent chills down my spine and wisdom to my ears, such as, ""An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind."" However, the actors don't make me cry or moved. It seemed that was left for other departments such as: the director, composer, and cinematographer, but they can only do so much. Compared to ""The Extra-Terrestrial"" I found myself crying with Drew Barrymore when E.T. dies and when E.T. says, ""I'll be right here"" before he leaves to go home. That's power Gandhi does not have enough of, which I anticipate for a multi Oscar-winning movie.I may sound biased since E.T. was a movie I grew up with as a child, but it is a stronger film than Gandhi. Nonetheless, I am glad that Kingsley and Attenborough got the Oscars for actor and director, but picture should have most definitely been given to E.T. 9/10",Gandhi
76,bigverybadtom,"Great First Half, Weak Second Half",6,6 February 2013,"The first half of the movie made me develop an interest in Mohandas Gandhi and why he developed as he did. You see him young, wearing a turban but otherwise a regular suit and tie, and he encounters racism when he is thrown off a train for illegally being an a first class compartment when he is an Indian. Then he leads a struggle against racism in South Africa, winning some success before moving to India, which he says (in the movie) is a strange country to him. He would fight against British colonial rule of India, but then realizes that ending it might only lead to a government of Indians who would be just as bad-and then he adopts his famous white Indian clothing. After that, the movie falters, and we see less about Gandhi than the political events that follow, not delivered with great accuracy.Ben Kingsley delivers a perfect performance, looking and acting the part. But the image of Gandhi is completely idealized, and he never gets angry or otherwise seems like a real human being.

I confess, I was one of those people. I never really thought any further about Gandhi past those short statements made about him. ""He was a good and kind person, he was selfless and didn't back down from injustice but did so peacefully."" Well the truth is he was just a person. Neither good nor bad but he was complicated. His heart appeared to be in the right place but now I wonder if he was just as stubborn and arrogant as everybody else. The impression he made on others may have been created by right place, right time. There are many people out there who fight injustices but we don't put them up on pedestals, sometimes we can't help but tear them down.It gives you a lot to think about if you have never seen this movie or know very little about Gandhi. The three hours are well utilised and the cast feel very invested in this production. It makes you want to like the movie and respect the content. At the end, I haven't changed my opinion of Gandhi but I feel that I have a better understanding of who he was as a person and the trials he went through. Some people may disagree with some of the things he did but since he was only human you cannot expect him to also be a saint.",Gandhi
78,sashank_kini-1,A true and wonderful biography,8,5 April 2009,"I am seeing this movie after about twenty seven years, still I found it to be wonderful and thoroughly watchable. I feel that a film made after 20 years of hard work cannot e bad in any way. The thing that I liked about Gandhi was that it firstly has a perfect cast who spoke fluent English. I did not see Nehru or other leaders speaking in broken English like in some other movies where all the Indians speak in a really terrible manner.Ben Kingsley sinks his teeth deep into his role as Gandhi and has done an excellent job and surely deserves the Oscar for best Actor. He perfectly understood the role that he was given and his eyes conveyed all his emotions. I also find it creditable that he changed his way of talking throughout the film. For example, when he was in South Africa he sort of had an accent but in his later life in India, he begins to speak like a normal Indian without an accent.Everyone else play their part very well. The film is much better than Slumdog Millionaire because it seems to true and the characters come to life, mainly because they are experienced. The film deserves all the Oscars that it has got. I did find it a bit long, especially towards the end, yet it succeeds in narrating the life of Gandhi. 8 out of 10.",Gandhi
79,khatcher-2,Took nearly twenty years to make - not a single minute was wasted,9,24 December 2001,"Here indeed is one of the great films of the 20th Century about one of the greatest men of the 20th Century. Ben Kingsley's interpretation of the Mahatma must go down in history as one of the most perfect cinema rôles ever carried out. Throughout the long film you forget you are watching an actor playing the part of a great man in history: you are watching the real Gandhi. A gigantic performance indeed. Richard Attenborough's patient and perfect directing added all the superlatives possible to make a crowning achievement, transporting  biographic films into another dimension.It is all there: from the most intimate and poignant portrait to the incredible crowd scenes, beautifully captured in the most painstaking photography. You do not just watch the scenes unfold  you live them, you feel them, so captivating they are; and Ravi Shankar's music tugs at you, spellbinds you, forces you into sympathy, admiration and so many other feelings. Enthralling: how such a cinematographic work of art can reach such proportions is truly amazing; this film is nothing less than a miracle. During 1971 I travelled a good bit around India; I constantly had to apologise to energetic Indians who approached me on the subject of the British Raj. I had not even been born. But as a young and unappointed ambassador, I felt it my duty to bow my head in that country which is a microcosm of the whole planet. Thanks to this film, `Gandhi', Attenborough and Kingsley have said just about all there was to say.< For men may come and men may go, but Gandhi goes on forever >",Gandhi
80,jmathur_swayamprabha,A tribute to Richard Attenborough,9,29 August 2014,"Sir Richard Attenborough has passed away. The artist who is best known for his Oscar winning directorial venture - Gandhi (1982) is no more. An actor turned director, Richard Attenborough touched the sky of excellence in his making of Gandhi. This was the first English movie seen by me. While paying my tribute to the great filmmaker, I am reviewing that only.Gandhi starts from 24 years old Mohandaas Karamchand Gandhi's journey to South Africa in 1893 with a law degree in his possession. And then starts his quest for truth while sticking to his path of non-violence, together forming his great mantra of Satyagrah. After fighting against racial discrimination for 21 long years on the foreign land, he came back to his motherland to follow the same philosophy and strategy of his against the colonial rule in his own nation. After roaming about the nation on the advice of Goalkrishna Gokhle, he started his struggle from Champaran in 1917 and went ahead with the masses taking that beginning to the point of Quit India Movement in 1942 after which end of the colonial rule in India was just a matter of time. But the problem of mutual distrust and hatred between the communities was even bigger than the colonial rule which divided this great nation and swallowed lakhs of innocent lives including the one which was of Gandhi himself. \ Richard Attenborough has done justice to his work and recreated history on the screen with near perfection. This sincere filmmaker devoted two decades in making of this epic movie and the end result proved to be an invaluable asset to the Indian cinema as well as the world cinema. He showed better sense by showing Gandhi's political journey only in his adulthood and skipped the events pertaining to his childhood. A movie is to be completed within a reasonable time frame and hence it was necessary to leave the initial phase of Gandhi's life.Flaws are there in the movie. Sardar Patel (Saeed Zaffrey) does not look the legendary Iron Man of India from any angle. Ditto for certain other characters alongwith ignoring certain significant historical events of that period. But these flaws cannot snatch the characteristic of being a great movie from Gandhi. Attenborough's in-depth research work and perfect casting of Ben Kingsley and Rohini Hattangadi for the lead roles of Gandhi and Kasturba contributed a lot to make it an unforgettable movie. Ben Kingsley is said to have slept on a small mat for a pretty long period in order to acclimatize him with the immortal character from the history of mankind. And when the movie was shot, he seemed to have created the soul of Gandhi in his earthly body. Lesser known Indian actress Rohini Hattangadi brought Kasturba alive on the screen.Attenborough extracted brilliant performances from almost all the cast members especially the Indian ones. No Hindi movie lover can forget Supriya Pathak as Manu and Neena Gupta as Abha in this movie. Making a realistic movie on that turbulent period of history while keeping Gandhi at the nucleus was by no means an easy task (and that's why two decades went into its making), so justice could not be done to certain historical characters. However the great filmmaker avoided trivial things which any formula-obsessed Indian filmmaker would not have been able to avoid viz. the affair of Acharya J.B. Kripalani as well as that of Sucheta and that of Indira and Feroze.By default perhaps, certain biases and contradictions in the great man's personality have been revealed though there's no bias in the filmmaker's approach either towards Gandhi or against Gandhi.The movie is an engaging one right from the word 'go' to its conclusion as John Briley has written the screenplay with sheer brilliance. The complete narrative moves forward speedily without a pause. The whole milieu is realistic and we seem to travel through that era getting a vision of India that was in the days of the British rule while watching this movie. All the action sequences render a feeling of realism. Technically, this is a flawless movie. Sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar has prepared optimum music for this extra-ordinary movie I have seen both the English and the Hindi versions of this movie (on Doordarshan, of course) and found that anybody interested in history or the life of Gandhi can watch this umpteen number of times. It entertains as well as enlightens.As asserted in my review of the book My Experiments with Truth also, I feel sorry when I find people seeking pleasure in cursing Gandhi and enjoying the seemingly indecent talks about him (especially those related to his so-called experimentation in celibacy). You cannot understand Gandhi until you have at least a particle of himself in you. Attenborough had it, that's why he could understand what kind of a man M.K. Gandhi was.While paying my tribute to Richard Attenborough, I can't help remembering a dialog from this immortal piece of art of himself. When Gandhi was arrested at a point in the movie, the concerned police officer says to him, 'I am sorry Mr. Gandhi but you are under arrest' and Gandhi replies, 'I am not sorry'. That, I feel, should be our spirit for sticking to our ideals and our chosen path.",Gandhi
81,RossRivero99,A masterpiece,10,13 June 2014,"Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is the best and most inspirational movie of 1982. Based on the life ans times of Mahatma Gandhi another one of the world's most influential men who believed in nonviolent protest in order to get independence from England in the mid 1900's, but soon Dr. Martin Luther king Jr. would use that same method for the Civil Rights Movement a few decades later. The movie stars Ben Kingsley in his only Oscar winning role as Gandhi who really was a man of his word, the movie compares to historical epics like Braveheart, Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's List, Amistad, Malcolm X, and The Bridge on the River Kwai. Though mostly historically accurate the movie deserved all of the Oscars it took at the 55th Academy awards ceremony because it is just a great movie.",Gandhi
82,oOoBarracuda,"Gandhi, part of the story",6,4 March 2016,"It appears as though I am in the minority of many reviewers of this film, in that I didn't care much for it. Perhaps, after a second viewing, I would find more to appreciate about this film. Although I can recognize the exceptional acting of Ben Kingsley, it is not enough to warrant a second viewing from me. I found the pacing incredibly slow, and I am not one that immediately holds distaste of a long movie. On the contrary, I rather enjoy long movies, as I feel that is the best movie to see the most writing. This movie, however, went into far too much minute detail of the titular character's life, for me. Gandhi tells the story, well, of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian lawyer turned liberator and world leader promoting peace and love towards fellow human beings. A simple ideology, much like Jesus taught, which is certainly deserving of a long movie evaluating the man behind the message and seeing from what beginnings he came. The way this movie was done simply didn't do that for me. A tour-de-force performance from Ben Kingsly wasn't enough from keeping the rest of the movie from falling flat. Elevated to mythic proportions, I wonder how much of the Gandhi on-screen from the 1982 Best Picture winner mirrors that of the Gandhi that walked the earth. A feel-good film that avoided much of the titular figure's controversies left me incredibly disappointed. there was more to Gandhi that met the eye, certainly; but there was even more to Gandhi than met the eye, even upon the conclusion of Richard Attenborough's epic.",Gandhi

85,roghache,"Beautiful, epic portrait of India's man of peace...but with qualms",9,11 May 2006,"This is a magnificent portrayal of the life of India's Mahatma Gandhi. The film begins with Gandhi's assassination by a fellow Hindu and his massively attended funeral. It then proceeds to chronicle his life over a half century, from his early years as a young lawyer, to his advocacy of non violent protest as his country's spiritual leader, resulting in the peaceful liberation of India from British rule. Gandhi was an Indian attorney, educated in England, who went on to take up the cause of racial equality in South Africa. He then returned to India and struggled to bring about his country's independence from Britain through the use of nonviolent means. One of his major obstacles was the uniting of Hindu and Moslem Indians in this cause. He achieved his goal of independence but through the formation of two separate countries, India and Pakistan, with a further division of Pakistan later forming Bangladesh. In depicting Gandhi's life, the film paints a vivid portrait of racial discrimination, both in South Africa and in his native India. Gandhi is an important historical figure as other great leaders, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, have employed his peaceful approach to causes of civil rights and racial equality in their own countries.This was a simple & humble man without wealth, property, official title, or political position. Yet Gandhi is seen as India's greatest leader, a man who insisted that his followers achieve their goals through civil disobedience rather than violence. The film captures with equal brilliance his simple tasks, such as spinning cotton or scooping salt, and his dramatic methods, especially his fast unto death. Gandhi's commitment to his goals and his determined but peaceful pursuit of them are well portrayed, as he shows himself willing to suffer and possibly even die to achieve his ends. Ben Kingsley, a British actor of paternal Indian origin himself, is masterful in his portrayal of the great Hindu leader, both during his years as a young lawyer in South Africa and later as the simple and modest man wearing wire rimmed glasses, a loin cloth, and shawl. He perfectly captures Gandhi's humility, intensity, dignity, and inner strength. Although Kingsley had a significant role in Schindler's List, for me he will always be Gandhi in the role he was born to play.The wonderful star studded supporting cast includes John Gieguld as the Indian Viceroy (Lord Irwin) who ignores Gandhi, John Mills as the earlier Viceroy, Edward Fox as the cruel English General Dyer who ruthlessly fires on a crowd, Trevor Howard as the considerate and respectful Judge Broomfield, and Ian Charleston as a local Christian clergyman. Journalistic roles are portrayed by Candice Bergen as a photographer for Life magazine, and Marin Sheen a New York Times reporter.The movie was filmed on location in India and has stunning cinematography throughout. The scenes of India (both countryside and crowded Calcutta) plus the dramatic funeral crowd depiction which features half a million extras, lend this film the impression of a sweeping epic. David Lean's only worthy rival is Richard Attenborough, who directed this picture. It fully deserved its numerous Oscars which include Best Picture, Actor, Director, Cinematography, and Costuming. This is an incredible movie which gives viewers of all nations and faiths an appreciation for the life and work of India's beloved Hindu leader. However, I have some definite qualms about this epic. As is often the case with Hollywood, Christianity is not cast here in a particularly stellar light, Christians are generally depicted as bigots, and the clergyman is not personally very inspiring. Rev. Andrews seems to have a weak theology himself and is portrayed as rather pathetic compared with the wise & great Hindu leader. I have little knowledge of the movie's historical accuracy in its depiction of Gandhi. While one certainly should not cast aspersions upon the deceased, this picture appears to totally overlook any flaws Gandhi may have had. I am quite leery of putting people on pedestals and frankly, the Indian leader is elevated to a state approaching deity in this film. Certainly Gandhi made an enormous contribution to India's history and became an admirable model of peaceful resistance to injustice, but it is Christ who set the example of a life lived perfectly. He is another who lived humbly without wealth, property, title, or position and is the one on whom we should genuinely model our lives in every respect. Gandhi is unquestionably a stunning film, but I bear all this in mind.",Gandhi

It seems you haven't lived if you haven't seen Schlinder's List and in 1982 you must have been some associal monster when not taking care about this movie. Anyway, the person Gandhi may not be mixed up with this movie as how great Gandhi must be as living person the movie itself comes over quite dated twenty years later. The problem is that Gandhi follows too much the strict base of any other biography and apart from Gandhi who stands up against the British colonists there is no real story. A movie that lasts about 4 hours could have explained more the killing for instance as all by all you still are left with mysteries and someone who sat down such a long time wants to know more, not? Attenborough has never been a brilliant director, he just chooses both his subjects and examples well. Is the movie overrated then? Not at all, it even is a movie that has to be seen (for the extreme good performances from Ben Kingsley alone) but I can't just escape the feeling that in 1982 I would have rated it with four stars whereas now three.",Gandhi

88,ozthegreatat42330,The Biopic of the Century,10,20 March 2007,"Time magazine voted Mahatma Gandhi ""The Man of The Century."" And I have come to the conclusion that Sir Richard Atenborough's lavish and epic biography is the ""Biopic"" of the Century. Told in a grand epic manner in a flashback of his life, the story tells of the efforts of Mohandas K. Gandhi, a young lawyer who went on to play a major role in the independence movement of India and Pakistan, and the great advocate of nonviolent protest. With then unknown Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, leading an all star cast the film over three hours (3 hrs 8 Mina actually) covers his days as a young lawyer in South Africa, attempting to break the back of apartheid, at least for Indian people in that country. He never held office of any kind, but he inspired a world, in the midst of World Wars and social upheaval.Excellent performances by Kingsly, Candice Bergen, Edward Fox, Trevor Howard, Ian Charleson, Michael Holdern, John Mills among dozens of others, set against the beauty and squalor of India compel you to be drawn into the film. The Amristar Massacre alone is both shocking and telling of the great struggle to bring about the end of British rule in India. If you have not seen it, you have truly missed one of the greatest events in history. A must see.",Gandhi
89,werefox08,Gandhi.............Far Above A Saint,9,16 April 2013,"Gandhi is a great movie, and truly deserved its 8 Oscars. Director Sir Richard Attenbourgh finding an actor like Ben Kingsley, must have felt like he had discovered Plutonium. Kingsley turned out to be more like Gandhi than the Mahatma himself. If you don't learn something from this movie, check into a clinic for Nazis. There are many scenes that touch you. My favourite is when a big important judge played by Trevor Howard is visibly shaken when he looks at Gandhi in the dock. Howard is diminished in stature just by looking at humanity ...in the flesh. It is undoubtedly a true epic (Titanic was not...not even close) and a movie about a man who really was real...and his story very real. The old religions lean on old books that are almost certainly ...no-where near what REALLY happened. To-day the Catholic church scratches around for people who ""other people"" say did great things, so they can proclaim them saints. Utter rubbish. The first thing The Catholics need to do is stop sexually abusing children.",Gandhi
90,dallasryan,Gandhi is Good in a world where we Need to 'Give them Something to Fight About',8,4 May 2012,"Gandhi was a great movie. It was meant to be during his time that there would be someone like him. That's how it was meant to be. It just goes to show the universal theme, everyone in India rises together and focuses on getting the British out. Once the British are out, then their focus goes to how much they hate each other, the Muslims hating the HIndu's, the Hindu's hating the Muslims as then a Civil War starts to break out. Then let's say those problems get eradicated, then they would focus on which water is better to drink, Dasani or Aquafina and they would have a war over that. That's why those Miller Lite commercials were always so good, where one group of people would say 'Tastes Great' and the other group of people would disagree and say 'Less Filling' and both groups would start an argument chanting their belief, their belief in beer!! . It was, ironically, a very thought provoking metaphor saying 'We all like the freaking beer, but there will always be something to argue and fight about because we're human beings and that's what we do, we'll argue about which species of Cockroach is the prettiest and probably get in a war over that'. That's exactly what it was about in Gandhi, The Wind that Shakes the Barley and in everyday life pretty much. You can't beat everyday life, but Gandhi tried and in the end he did a lot of good, and he definitely went by what he knew in his heart, not what he saw. That was a lot of what he was saying and conveying too, 'Go by what you know in your heart because you can at least control that, if you can't control the rest of it.' Really great movie. Ben Kingsley gave one of the top 10 greatest performances of all time in Gandhi in my opinion. If you've never seen much of Kingsley's work, watch Gandhi first and then watch him in Sexy Beast.",Gandhi

94,michael_the_nermal,Excellent Biopic,9,2 July 2008,"Spoilers aheadRichard Attenborough's biographical film on Mohanndas K. Gandhi is one of the best movies I have seen. Ben Kingsley is superb as the Indian statesman, and his Oscar was well-deserved. This movie focuses on the most important points in Gandhi's political career, from his struggle to bring social equality for Indian indentured laborers in South Africa; to his desire for British India's political independence, and the nonviolent means by which he does this; to his bitter fight to end the civil war between Pakistan and India, for which he ultimately paid with his life. While not totally historically accurate, the film treats the major events, including the Amritsar Massacre and the Partition War of 1947, with great sensitivity and intelligence.All of the actors in this movie did an excellent job. The Indian actors who portrayed Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohammed Jinnah, the founding fathers of India and Pakistan, respectively, were brilliant, although most viewers probably would not know who these actors are. Martin Sheen is good as the photojournalist who befriends Gandhi and participates in his Salt March, and the lovely Candace Bergen is also wonderful as Time-Life photographer Margaret Bourke-White.In short, this is one of the finest movies ever made, even though many of the actors are unknowns. It is ironic that some of the best acting I've seen in the ""Godfather"" movies and in ""Gandhi"" were by relatively obscure and unknown, and hence ""non-famous"" actors. It just goes to show that being a big ""A-list"" star does not ensure that you are the best actor there is. Watch ""Gandhi"". You will not regret it.",Gandhi

I don't know how much was true and how much was untrue in Gandhi's depiction in this film, but certainly it makes me feel that they wanted to be the most accurate possible. Gandhi is very well portrayed by Ben Kingsley, in various scenes you get tricked and believe it's the actual Gandhi, especially in the second half of the film. It's a really long film, and has even got an intermission (wich allows it also to divide it for two separate occasions). Gandhi's teachings portrayed in the film are definitely some of the best things in this film, they definitely allow to get deep meanings from the story.",Gandhi
96,lediscipledessocrates,Can't relate to the sensibilities,7,18 July 2009,"I fully endorse the opinion which the jury at the academy awards shared regarding the quality of this movie. To be fair the scale at which the movie has been produced is massive and grand. The script is beautifully written ,primarily because of the fact that Gandhiji's life and contribution to human emancipation has been dealt with in judicious detail. The movie also shines in departments such as cinematography, screenplay . The inquisitive reader may then quite naturally ask me- Why have you given the movie a miserly 7 points in your rating?. This question deserves the following answer- Firstly, the etiquette of the movie is quite western. This is something which is hard to digest, for the protagonist and the storyline both are Indian. Ben Kingssley's ethnicity is the only thing which is Indian in the movie. His manners and demeanour are purely western. The style of speech and dialogue delivery is alien to the Indian mentality.Let us all thus allow ourselves to independently judge the movie disregarding the Oscars it won.What we get is a brilliant script performed brilliantly but in a manner so completely western that the movie should have named ""Gandhi in Perspective"".I was about to give the movie 9 but my eyes caught sight of the movie's name at quite an inopportune moment. 7 for it's brilliance, the 3 it didn't get for it's incredible deviation from Indian sensibilities.",Gandhi

100,Kubris,What can one man do?,8,3 September 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 183Gandhi is a 4- star film- ignore my gripes, disregard its competition, and forget the score at the bottom. Mohandas K. Gandhi is unarguably one of the most worthy topics of a biopic in all of history, and this film does him much justice. As far as representing a man's life goes, this is top notch.This is a film about the man- his ideas of politics, how to fight, his relationships and then his work. He who would play such a person must be able to live up to his legacy- and Ben Kingsley delivers. One of the greatest performances of all time. The voice, the mannerisms, the walk, the weight loss it completely sells the character. The uncanny resemblance doesn't hurt either: in the TV footage I couldn't tell if they used real news clips or old-style filming. His performance is the best part of the film. What is covered? After a Lawrence of Arabia-like start, the first of several parallels, the film cuts to a 30 year old Gandhi being booted of a train, and we see the beginning of his philosophy. From there there's a fairly smooth telling of his life and accomplishments, with wonderful decoration, costumes, and incredible makeup. It certainly feels like a 3 hour film, but despite being heavy on drama and not action, the film moves well.Being very much centered on Gandhi, very little room is left for support. I maybe caught 3 other characters' names. Also, there are spots where actions don't make sense, and sometimes words too. Also there's the fact that while the film is incredible, lesson-teaching and very well made, other films exist that have done that too while being more *interesting*. Lastly, Gandhi is a worthy story told in the best medium, but the film's proficiency can't change the fact that nothing was added to the film by being made in 1982 as opposed to a decade either way.I think I've touched on all the major points of the film: Gandhi is one of the greatest figures in history, Kingsley is perfect as him and as an actor, and the film is as well made as it possibly could be.

However, after seeing it again last year as an adult -- and now having watched it a few more times as I teach concepts of civil disobedience to college students -- the film really stands out as a masterpiece of the modern biopic.Visually, it's stunning; the storytelling flows well, too. Some people might find it slow, but only if they're impatient. They should know themselves better than to watch this; they can get the condensed version on A&E Biography. The acting is superb, as every scene will highlight a different actor's abilities (many times, you will think ""I know that actor!""), all reflected off Ben Kingsley's own amazing performance. For a generation, his face *is* Gandhi's. That's how well he blends into the persona. Look for Bernard Hill is brief appearance; you know him from *Titanic* and *Lord of the Rings*. Look for a very young Daniel Day-Lewis -- his face is just sort of growing into adulthood.The film does take a time commitment; if you can't watch it in one sitting, don't bother. But from start to finish, you will see an amazing story of a person who should be a model for us all in this day and age.

102,lucasversantvoort,Hollywood spectacle at its best...and worst,6,6 May 2015,"Gandhi is the 1982 epic that aimed to faithfully retell the live and times of (who else) Gandhi. For me, this film symbolizes both the spectacular grandeur of Hollywood and that a big budget doesn't necessarily equal a truly great film.The film starts off dramatically with Gandhi's murder after which it flashes back to earlier portions of his life, including the scene that the film presents as the life-changing event of Gandhi's life: being thrown out of a train in South Africa for being an Indian despite possessing a first-class ticket. This spurs him into action, resulting in him launching a nonviolent protest campaign for Indian rights in South Africa. The campaign is partly successful and Gandhi returns to India where he is urged to aid in securing India's independence from the British Empire as well. The film also chronicles the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, India's eventual independence, its religious division and outbursts of violence between Muslims and Hindus, Gandhi's hunger strike, the Partition of India and Gandhi's eventual murder.That's a lot of ground to cover and it's one of the reasons the film didn't have as much impact as I think it should have. The film tends to feel like a greatest hits version of Gandhi's life and it loses steam well before it crosses the finish line. Like I said, it's brought to life with all the power a Hollywood epic can muster. The acting is great all around, with Ben Kingsley providing a historic performance on par with George C. Scott's turn as Patton; the cinematography is impressive, particularly during Gandhi's funeral with several hundred thousand extras actually present (no CGI nonsense), etc. But for lack of a better word, it gets pretty boring.To get back to the film feeling like Gandhi's greatest hits, at least the filmmakers were thankfully aware of the impossibility of a 'perfect' film adaptation of Gandhi's life as seen in the opening statement: ""No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man..."" So Attenborough and co. obviously dismissed the idea of a complete and perfect adaptation and instead chose to focus on remaining true to the spirit of Gandhi. This is all fine and well, especially considering the fact that many successful historical films have always been accused of revisionism in some way, but I have doubts to whether or not they succeeded. It's Kingsley's performance by far that comes closest to instilling Gandhi's spirit in the viewer, but I don't think the film itself rises above being a mere 'film version' of Gandhi's life that impresses on scale alone. Yes, we experience the major events in his life in a visually impressive manner, but we don't really get inside his head, I feel. The one scene that tries to explain how he became 'Gandhi' is the scene where he's thrown off the train, but it all feels thin. And that's my problem with the film in a nutshell: despite its epic nature (and all the care and passion that undeniably went into it), the film tends to feel thin. The film focuses mostly on Gandhi being Gandhi rather than really digging into how Gandhi became 'Gandhi'.Stray observation: Why does the film start with showing Gandhi's murder and end with pretty much the same scene, but with a cut to black when Gandhi is shot, as if implying it's too harrowing to show even though you showed it at the beginning?",Gandhi
103,FrankBooth_DeLarge,A stunning portrait of one of the most important men in our history,9,3 February 2005,"Gandhi was a man who had many followers and stood up to the British armies in India. He didn't use a sword or a gun, and he never had to hurt anyone, he was a man who could use words and get an entire nation to follow and believe in him. That my friends is a true, powerful leader. The film Gandhi is often called one of the worst films ever to win Best Picture. It is an excellent movie and was very deserving of its Best Picture Oscar.The movie starts out with his assassination, and then the rest of the movie tells the story about his life, from the start to the end.The acting is great in this movie, even though it is very hard, and unhealthy to become as thin as Gandhi was, but Ben Kingsley does a great job at playing the part. This movie follows the events that took place during his time very well, and portrays them realistically.Despite having a long running time, this is a very well worth watching movie, and you should see Gandhi to see how a man can change the world without raising a fist.",Gandhi
104,ween-3,Sweeping Epic With A Bravura Performance,10,27 December 2000,"A magnificent movie by Attenborough and a career-topper for Ben Kingsley. Brilliant story of the man who almost single-handedly brought India kicking and screaming into the world as an independent nation. One of this century's true heroic figures, it is a crying shame that more than 50 years later, we are still dealing with the dangerous fallout of the Indian-Pakistani aggression that he so desperately sought to end.Count this movie amongst the great epics of cinematic history. All the supporting performances, particularly that of Roshan Seth as Nehru, are an absolute joy to behold. Classic cinematography, and a masterwork of a score by Ravi Shankar.  Attenborough, of course, when he's not out raising dinosaurs, is a director of epics par excelllence (""A Bridge Too Far"" is another stroke of genius). Ben Kingsley spends the better part of 3 hours on screen in an absolutely riveting performance. The road to peace is a hard road. Just ask Nelson Mandela or John Lennon. This movie allows the viewer to take part of the journey.",Gandhi
105,joshuafagan-64214,A Great Movie About a Great Man,10,26 October 2015,"Wow, the late Richard Attenborough made quite a career for himself, hasn't he? Between acting, directing, and so much more, he has earned a position as one of the preeminent figures of England. You probably know him best from his role as John Hammond in Jurassic Park. If you are older or a film buff, you also know him from the classic film The Great Escape (an interesting move that I will have to review at some point). I hope he rests in peace. He lived a good long life. I hope he had no real regrets. You know you lived for a long time when you don't die until twenty after you played an old man in a film.But of all his accomplishments, his greatest is directed this classic about one of the most important men in the twentieth century. Gandhi is not a perfect movie. It wastes too much time on unimportant topics and does not go into as harsh realities as it should, considering its wide scope. But it is number forty four in my top one hundred films for a few reasons: one, it is the definitive image on how to do a wide-ranging biopic, as well as the definitive image on one of the world's most important men; two, it is one of the grandest movies in history, one with a scale nothing short of extraordinary, a scale that will stick in your mind long after you see it, a scale that evokes the same emotions in the viewer as one imagines were felt by Gandhi; three, it is brilliantly acted on all fronts, particularly by the man who plays Gandhi, the great Ben Kingsley, perhaps proving the adage that Brits make the best actors; and four, it takes the watcher on a journey, churning their emotions up and down like a boat on the stormy open seas, leaving them different and changed and in all venues, satisfied.The film begins with Gandhi getting shot. This is a rather dark way to start what is ultimately an uplifting movie, but it is a good decision if one is to think about it: all of Gandhi's work is against the backdrop of racism and violence and crude, ignorant anger, and this depiction of this cold, callous, resentful act establishes the backdrop of the film, against which we see all the positive, progressive events take place. It is a good way to draw the reader into the story and put them firmly in the world of the film, a decision that becomes even sharper when you think about the fact that this movie is a historical epic, the sort of movie that many people could easily tune out of unless you give them a reason to stay awake. This film certainly does.It is the same trick that LoA (one of my ten favorite films of all time) plays at its start. Well... calling it a trick would be a bit of a misnomer. It's a classical framing device, one that has been used for centuries. I don't even know if it's trying to serve the functions I described in the last paragraph. But that doesn't mean it does not serve them well.It must be noted that this film is a British production. Such is obvious if you read what I've above written or even watched the film itself, but it is important to note. If you know anything about world history, you know that the British owned India for most all of the colonial era. This is something I could go into for pages on end. But I don't have the space or the time. So I will simply say that this is the best of a series of 80s films that could be considered almost an apology letter to India.In any case, it is one of the most evocative and emotional and moving epics. When you watch Gandhi talk, you don't feel that you are in the cinema or in the comfort of your bedroom. You feel like you're on the march with one of the world's greatest leaders in some of his greatest moments. It's like someone reaches into where you are and pulls you into the screen. Of course, in some ways, it's even better than that, for you get orchestral swells and fine direction. It charges you up.As a historical film, it succeeds. If you want a detailed, every-moment-laid-out account, go watch some documentaries. Seriously; there are good ones out there. Films are supposed to, above all else, evoke emotion. So, in the case of a historical movie, they are supposed to evoke the emotions of the era and its events. This film does that. You feel the twists and turns of the difficulties and stresses of the time. You don't just feel for Gandhi because he is the 'good' guy going up against the 'evil' that is racism and violence and disunity. You also feel for him because he you see his vision for a brighter and more prosperous India and world and you see it be attacked at every turn.What I like most about this film is that it does not shy away from the waning years of his life and their disappointments. Yes, he succeeded in many things, not least of which in getting India its independence. But the country was broken into two nations that continue to have bad blood to this day. Nothing exemplifies this more than the ending. We see the beginning scene once more, where he gets shot. But then we are treated to a quote of his, one with which I will close out this review: When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it. Always.",Gandhi

History was indeed made by one man in this film, however it has entirely omitted the sacrifices by others almost equally important.Richard Attenborough, a legend himself, has taken on a gargantuan task by helming such a powerful and historic project. While critics and historians can argue night and day, as a movie goer, this is movie shows the humble beginnings of even humbler old man who shaped a nation.Ben Kingsley bears such a remarkable resemblance to the real Ghandi himself, you often forget this is a film and not a documentary of the real man.

This is an epic of epic proportions, that's for sure.

Ben Kingsley superb in the title role. He does Gandhi better than Gandhi,!

108,de_niro_2001,Another slightly over-rated 80s movie,8,31 May 2008,"This film had been a pet project of Sir Richard Attenborough's which took almost quarter of a century to reach the screen. Sir Richard is a very staunch pacifist and Gandhi is definitely the one of the greatest pacifists within living memory. This film certainly taught us all a great deal more about him and introduced many to his very sensible maxim ""An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind"". Although his approach to his religion was too strict for many people it is very creditable how ecumenical he was. He declared himself not just a Hindu but a Christian, a Jew, a Muslim and a Buddhist. His adherence to his pacifism was remarkable and he achieved infinitely more by being not violent than anyone could by being violent. One of his other sayings, not quoted in the film, was ""I am against violence. The good it does is only temporary. The evil it does is permanent"". Very true! The pace of the film, though, is a bit slow. It plods along like the Mahatma on one of his protest marches and has a bit of a history lesson air to it. Certainly, until I saw this film I had never heard of the Amritsar massacre. It is good the scene where General Dyer says at the enquiry that he would have given aid to any wounded who had ""applied"" and then the barrister asks ""General Dyer, how does a child shot with a 303 Lee Enfield ""apply"" for help?"". He has no answer to give. It is very poignant the following scene where Gandhi and Pandit Nehru are looking down the well which several people jumped down in order to escape the fusillade of bullets. None of them survived. The film though does contain a few slightly melodramatic touches, characteristic of Richard Attenborough, such as the wee one crying next to his slain mother during the massacre. I have not seen the actor Peter Harlow in any other films but he is absolutely spot on as Lord Mountbatten, to whom the film is dedicated, a man who took a great deal of interest in this film during its long gestation and who was tragically and brutally murdered by the IRA. A demonstration of how pointless violence is. Although this film is good, like a lot of early 80s films it is a bit over-rated. Like Chariots of Fire, if it were being made nowadays it would be a lot more impressive with the help of a bit of CGI. It would also be different in that we have a very different approach to historic films nowadays.",Gandhi

110,Tom Murray,One of the greatest men of the 20th century.,10,26 July 2001,"The film, Gandhi, is Richard Attenborough's tribute to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948). Although it won eight Academy Awards, Including Best Director and Picture, the film has been criticized for a variety of reasons by people who did not realize that Gandhi himself was the greatness of the film. Ben Kingsley portrayed Gandhi to perfection. The Indian music was by the great Ravi Shankar.Gandhi was an Indian lawyer, educated in England, who entered the political arena in South Africa to fight against the treatment of Indian immigrants, uniting both Hindus and Muslims in the cause. Everyone, even his enemies, were impressed by his willingness to suffer, even die, at the hands of those in power, rather than back down from a just cause. He won the victory by insisting that his followers use civil disobedience and eschew all violence, thereby depriving the authorities of a justification for violent suppression. Gandhi explained it: ""When I despair, I remember that all through history, the way of truth and love has always won. There have been murderers and tyrants, and for a time they can seem invincible. But in the end they always fall. Think of it, always.""He returned to India after the victory to become that country's spiritual leader. He led the struggle for independence from Britain, still insisting on non-violent means. The goal of independence was achieved but the Hindus and Muslims did not unite as they had in South Africa. Instead, they caused India to be split into India, Pakistan and East Pakistan, which later separated from Pakistan as Bangladesh. Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu fanatic.Two decades later, his methods were used by Martin Luther King in the fight against segregation in the United States of America. Gandhi and King were both willing to die for a cause and they both did but even now, in the next century, there is still some hatred between Hindus and Muslims in Kashmir state and between blacks and whites in America. Where is the next Gandhi? Where is the next Martin Luther King? Such men are still needed all over the world.",Gandhi
111,HiddenVoice,The Man who Taught us the meaning of Life of Unity,8,23 December 2005,"First I want to point out one thing,that is, Indians should be ashamed of themselves.I mean their very own people could not write or make a film as unforgettable and powerful as this one about a person who was more than a GOD to them.It took one very honest English filmmaker to produce an epic film about an Ordinary person just like us who went on to achieve some extraordinary and remarkable things.A man with no power whatsoever single handedly freed a nation,causing stir around the world.The world need to know the significance of people like Oskar Schindler and Gandhi,what their quests were,what they wanted to achieve.Survival in the darkest hours of inhumanity.The will to do something that will change the way we think about one another.Schindler and Gandhi did that and showed that a single human being can make a difference and therefore prove that every race can coexist if we want.And for their effort these two historical figures should receive a NOBEL prize.But do the world give a damn.I mean take India and Pakistan for example.Did Gandhis lesson and message taught these two nations?Of course not,they are at war all the time,hatred is present between them.No matter how hard he tried ,even in his last breath he only hoped for Unity,in the end it all came back to the same place.Inhumanity,discrimination,hatred,racism all these things occur every day in our lives and yet we learn nothing from our ancestors.Sorry for being pessimistic but I had to let it out.Gandhi is one person who didn't believe in race or the difference in us.He believed in Love that could spread and that could be shared by everyone together as one.He was a form of Jesus,no matter how much people hated him he always showed his love in return.Like Jesus he did not use violence but he taught people not to use it.Attenborough succeeds in capturing the mans true spirit and Kingsley was the only person who could've done it.Not even an actual Indian could have portrayed Gandhi the way Kingsley did.He simply was a reincarnation of Gandhi.A remarkable achievement that will live on forever and hope people will understand its message.But Gandhi wasn't the only one who led to the freedom.It is unfair that he was widely considered the person who led India to freedom,in reality a lot people had their share.In the film Gandhi always referred to various races but he rarely refers to sikhs.Sikhs were the real heroes actually.They fought for their freedom by all means possible.Some used non-violent methods and some of course used violence.I'm not saying that they did the right thing to use violence but they should not have been forgotten.They were never once mentioned in the film since one of the scenes take place in Amritsar(the Massacre).Freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh, Subash Chandra Bose, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Udham Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Rajguru, Sukhdev etc. were involved in great deal of work to achieve freedom.The film is inaccurate in its portrayal of the politics.Gandhi may have shown us that the means of achieving freedom without violence and taught us the meaning of equality ,which is what I'm interested in, but he still was a politician.He was the reason why the partition took place but it was his failing.He didn't wanted that and somehow the politicians drove him to their side and he became a corrupt politician too.Giving Indians false hope in the end about Unity and forgetting the real heroes of the Independence.Gandhi's fame was mainly due to the media and there was nothing he could do about it.The sikhs were forgotten for their effort and that is why there is still so much hatred among the people of India.Living in the same country they still have conflicts.They hate each others race.Nevertheless,Gandhi's ideal approach of equality was what fascinates me.He tried to bring every one together.He treated everyone equally and that is what makes him an Iconic figure.And Sir Attenborough really captures that well.Indians made dozens of movies about Gandhi and not one of them were as epic as this one.In fact they were terrible and they think their movies are great.They should shut their Industry instead.",Gandhi
112,brower8,Essential history; good guys can win with good will and not guns,9,11 March 2003,"For all the macabre fascination with the unqualified bad guys of history that we have (how often do Hitler, Stalin, or even Mussolini appear as characters in movies), it's worth noting that the influence of Mohandas Gandhi has already outlasted that of any of the twentieth-century bad guys. Decolonization of Asia and Africa looks more permanent than the colonial empires.Gandhi was the most important of those who whittled away at colonial power, and surprisingly the least military and despotic. The Indian subcontinent was not the first part of the colonial world to get full independence, but it was the most important region, and in view of the obvious power of the British Empire it seemed the least likely to get it. In view of the contrast between India and much of the rest of the post-colonial world, India has probably done best in politics because of Gandhi.Gandhi appealed to the best in human nature, and if he didn't always succeed at bringing it out, he at least didn't make a mess of things with a personality cult or a lust for riches. An unlikely hero of a revolution, he had few tools for changing the world: ideas and ideals. Mandela, Havel, Walesa, and of course Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. owed much to him. Better Gandhi than Mao, Ho Chi Minh, or Fidel Castro.The movie moves slowly, as it must; Gandhi was a contemplative man more than his fascistic antithesis, the so-called ""Man of Action"". Likewise, 'his' India is an undeniably gritty place -- which is all that it can be. This movie is a tribute to the elegance of thought of one of the most genuine, honest, and decent Great Men of History, and the elegance shows.",Gandhi
113,canadude,Gandhi vs. Malcolm X,10,15 June 2004,"If I were to liken Attenborough's ""Gandhi"" to any other epic film, I would choose Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X."" Initially, of course, this may appear rather irrational, but just because Gandhi and Malcolm X differed in their methods (at least as historians and filmmakers would have us believe) their ends and many of their attitudes were exactly the same.Both men believed in the dignity of their people (whether ""their"" was defined across racial or national lines makes little difference) and, consequently, both believed in their right to freedom, to liberty. Both served time in jail, both had religious revelations, or rather, so as not to insult their achievements, spiritual revelations. Malcolm X believed in separation of the black population from the white population, though he wanted blacks to retain and gain the same rights as the whites. Gandhi believed Indians should have sovereignty without British interference or control - and retain and gain rights denied to them by their colonial oppressors. Both Malcolm X and Gandhi were struck by social problems of their people, problems of poverty, hunger, degeneracy and loss of identity. This final problem occupied both Malcolm X's and Gandhi's philosophies. They recognized that foreign dominance over their people, i.e. English over Indian and white over black, inevitably led to an inculcation of inferiority in the minds of the subjugated people. In both cases it was institutionalized, socially and politically (not to mention economically). The blacks and the Indians were led to believe by their oppressors that not only were they not capable of having sovereignty, freedom and the rights their oppressors enjoyed, but even if they were, they were not worthy of them. Gandhi and Malcolm X both recognized this problem and tried to resolve it.However, while both men fought to achieve similar goals, they differed in their means. Malcolm X advocated active resistance against the people he hated: the white oppressors. He was not afraid to say so - and employed the very racism that was meant to keep blacks down against the whites. He vehemently opposed the choice of many blacks to strive to gain rights within the existing system. Consequently he opposed people like Martin Luther King Jr. who, Malcolm X felt, pandered to the whites and made them all-too-comfortable. He, like Gandhi, fought for the dignity of his people and he made it very clear as to what this fight entailed.
Gandhi's approach is now famously described as ""nonviolent resistance."" While at first, this may seem too much like the methods of Martin Luther King Jr. of whom Malcolm X had a low opinion, Gandhi's nonviolence had little to do with negotiation and speech-making. The operative word is ""resistance"" and Gandhi inspired the Indian people to resist - and what makes Gandhi such an awe-inspiring figure, no doubt an inspiration for an epic film, is his innovativeness in not betraying his nonviolent, peaceful spirit in achieving Indian independence. From the emphasis on economic self-reliance, examples of which include cloth-weaving and illegal salt-making, to self-respect and respect and love for one's enemy, Gandhi's method was not only practical in the sense of economics, but also spiritual in terms of legitimating the goals and desires of the Indian people in the eyes of the British colonialists and, most importantly, in the eyes of the Indians themselves.Both Gandhi and Malcolm X were assassinated not by their oppressors, but rather, by extremist members of groups to which they also belonged: they died as a result of internal politics and internal dissent.
Malcolm X did not exactly achieve a separate black state, or (even less so) a return to the traditional ways of African blacks, to the roots of African-Americans. He did not solve the social problems of blacks, especially in urban areas. Gandhi inspired his people to win Indian independence, but he also did not resolve impending social and ethnic dilemmas that erupted shortly after independence was achieved.However, the world speaks more comfortably and openly about Gandhi than Malcolm X. No doubt, part of that stems from the fact that Gandhi's fight had a much larger scope literally - he occupied world attention. But, it would be wrong to deny that many people, historians among them, choose to put less emphasis on Malcolm X than, say, Martin Luther King Jr. because the former attempted to fight for rights more actively than other civil rights activists. Who's to say he was wrong? Nobody. How do we judge men like Gandhi and Malcolm X? The reason I decided to compare the two films is not only because of the shared similarities in the characters they portray. I also chose the two films because of their portrayal: Richard Attenborough shows us Gandhi, like Spike Lee shows us Malcolm X, without compromises and judgments.
In ""Gandhi"" Attenborough, through the phenomenal (and I mean Phenomenal) Ben Kingsley, captures the beautiful spiritual clarity with which Gandhi spoke and, furthermore, which he embodied in his actions. The film does not vilify the British colonialists any more than their actions vilify them - it presents and it invites the viewer to judge. It is flawlessly directed and it is one of the few great epics ever made. It obsesses to perfection about whom it is about. In that it is comparable to the passionate portrayal of Malcolm X in Spike Lee's film. However, while ""Malcolm X"" ends with an unfortunate false note of ""social importance,"" ""Gandhi"" transcends preaching and forced social commentary.And, most importantly, ""Gandhi"" reminds us of people who come and go, who love humanity and are not afraid to fight for it on their terms. It reminds us of people whose vision of existence is not stale and full of the empty words of politicians, but instead spiritual and moral clarity. One only has to watch Gandhi's self-confidence in argument with the various British soldiers and politicians he meets - he doesn't have to prattle and propagandize. He has discovered truth and it gives him comfort, strength and confidence - he lets it speak for him. This clarity is something many of us thirst for every day - and ""Gandhi"" reminds us that it is achievable.",Gandhi
114,iamyuno2,One of the Best Biographies Ever - And The Best About Gandhi Ever,10,3 January 2014,"Stunningly filmed. A cast full of great, great actors, and Ben Kingsley at his very best. An incredible true story that demands to be told (and it sticks to the truth, which is rare in a Hollywood film). It doesn't get any better than this - in a biography. Kingsley delivers one of the finest performances ever captured on film. You instantly believe you're watching Gandhi and he stays consistently true to his character throughout this lengthy effort. What an awesome performance! To me, Kingsley's performance as Gandhi rivals Peter O'Toole's fabulous performance in Lawrence Of Arabia in greatness - as does this movie as a whole, on every level. And, in fact, given the choice to watch either film again, I'd choose Gandhi - if only because Gandhi's work made a bigger impact on the world, for the better, and his fight was more protracted and noble. In other words, the story here is the classic battle of Good versus Evil (unlike that presented in Lawrence, where the lines are not so clear - especially in retrospect). That's saying a lot - because I don't think anyone would argue that Lawrence of Arabia, the movie, did not set the standard for movie marathons, movies on the level of a Gone With The Wind (although that was, artistically, a greater triumph than Lawrence or Gandhi, I would argue). This movie is done journalistically rather than artistically. There's no attempt to inflate or make the story bigger than it was or the lines more dramatic than they were in real life - and that's, in fact, one of its strengths. That's what gives its believability and makes you care about the outcome. Plus - Gandhi, the man (as portrayed by Kingsley), comes off as one of those people you would have idolized and followed given he chance...certainly someone you'd given your eye teeth to meet (unlike Lawrence Of Arabia, toward whom I feel an indifference, at best). You really care what happens to Gandhi and those around him as the story progresses toward its inevitable end - which, by the way, speaks loudly to the times in which we live today. What an incredible accomplishment - from top to bottom! My only disappointment - following this film - was that Kingsley was never again given a lead half as great as this. Why did Hollywood not give him suitably major roles after this film? Makes you wonder.",Gandhi

Check the castings: from Walter Huston and Aline MacMahon to Hurd Hatfield and Akim Tamiroff, the idiocies were difficult to envision much less comprehend.

Ben Kingsley does a remarkable job of inhabiting such an inspiring historical character. You'll find you could return to the film on his performance alone.The scenes in South Africa are particularly enthralling. GANDHI has a movie of different styles: documentary, luscious travelogue, and old style drama. The parts with the western media seem oddly reminiscent to the equivalent scenes in LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.And yet, this isn't a perfect film. It feels incomplete somehow. Perhaps the divisiveness of the caste-system in bringing about unity could have been presented a bit more forcefully and the expense of the sectarian Hindu/Muslim divide.Yet perhaps the biggest criticism must concern itself with the simple dramatic setbacks of the film. As Quentin Crisp - ""though, very cleverly, the narrative begins with his assassination, we are not continuously drawn forward at an ever-increasing pace throughout the rest of the picture towards this climax. We do not know why he was killed, we were never made aware of what specific danger he was in nor from what quarter disaster would spring.""",Gandhi

While critics and historians can argue night and day, as a movie goer, this is movie shows the humble beginnings of even humbler old man who shaped a nation.Ben Kingsley bears such a remarkable resemblance to the real Gandhi himself, you often forget this is a film and not a documentary of the real man.

There are many scenes to be treasured in this fine depiction of Gandhi's travails. Many. The story itself is quite unique: the intelligent use of an idea against power. The British Empire was the embodiment of the word 'Power'; but it was surrounded by a sea of ideas it couldn't countenance or embrace, to its loss. How victorious can cannons and bullets be? Ironically, not victorious at all since ideas always precede force. Fortunately for Britain the average person understood this principle and the psychotics were moved out of the way. One day America will wake up too. Ben Kinglsley was admirable in this role and thoroughly believable. The supporting cast is awesome. The story itself is a thriller from start to end.

Movies about oppression in foreign land, usually based on a true story.  And though while it does not make the events themselves any less terrible, it makes me numb to any strong emotion coming from films about the subject.  Maybe if I'd seen this film 10 years ago before I became heavily in love with films, I would have found a greater appreciation for it. Attenborough's directing is masterful, and it's his and the cinematographer's gorgeous work on this film and the really elevated it to a higher level.  That, and one of the finest performances off all-time by Sir Ben Kingsley.  I'm not too familiar with the life of Gandhi, but there is no doubt in my mind that Kingsley is anything less than a reflection of the man himself.  His performance was incredible, not to mention a great supporting cast.  The film's hefty running time could have been cut, being as a a few of the films scenes were just reiteration of points already established earlier on.  Pacing is the only real weak element present in the film.

124,LeaBlacks_Balls,Wonderful Film,10,21 February 2010,"The only times I've ever heard this film mentioned it was usually disparaging remarks about how it's overrated or how it stole awards from more deserving films the year it was released. Because of those comments I never really had much desire to see 'Gandhi.' What a mistake. This film is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.The film follows Mohandas K. Gandhi from when he was a young lawyer in South Africa, leading non-violent protest against the colonial British powers, to his assassination many years later, after he became known as 'The Father of India.' We see his struggles to unite the native population of India, including Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, to peacefully reject the authority of the British Empire through non-cooperation. We witness the sacrifices he and his followers made to sustain their vision of a free India, the torrents of abuse those who followed him suffered, and the astonishing way they all took it in stride, and the notoriety he and the movement gained all over the world.Of all the bio-pics I've seen, this is definitely at the top of the list. While other films need to romanticize and glorify their subjects, the real life Gandhi was fascinating enough not to warrant any embellishment on the filmmakers part.Over the three hour running time we not only get a thoughtful, detailed biography of this fascinating man, but we also get a history of India. We learn what it was like as a native living under Colonial rule, and what the country was like after the British left. We see what caused the rift between Muslims and Hindus, and the creation of present day Pakistan, and the tense, violent relations that still exist between the two nations today.In other films the actors playing their real life counterparts rarely disappear into their character. Ben Kingsley not only disappears into his role, he becomes Gandhi. Never once during the three hours did I catch myself thinking 'Hmm Ben Kingsley is acting really well!' I can't say that about many of the other acclaimed bio-pics I've seen. On top of Kingsley's brilliant performance, we have a large, wonderful supporting cast. The film also boasts beautiful cinematography and a gorgeous musical score. All of these elements make the long running time fly by.The makers of this film tried to get it made for over a decade, but kept reaching dead ends. It's a good thing that they pushed through the Hollywood bullshit and were able to make it. Not one minute or one penny were wasted on this magnificent film.'Gandhi' won Academy Awards for Actor, Director, Original Screenplay, Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design, Editing, and Best Picture.

125,nunoaraujoduarte,movieinthepark.blogspot.com,9,26 October 2011,"""Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth."" Albert Einstein said it. For great minds such as his, stunning is the result when allied with great actors. Ben Kinglsey reaches in here what might be his best performance as main actor, competing with his secondary role in Schindler's List. I imagine it would be unnecessary to describe the movie since everybody knows a little bit of Mahatma Gandhi. The movie is well made, you can get an idea of Gandhi's life. Nevertheless, I believe some crucial parts of his life are omitted, including some mistakes he made and plenty of his bizarre attitudes. It's understandable because the main goal here is obviously to emphasize Gandhi and his ideas' extreme uniqueness, but takes away some value, as it is always pleasant to lead with cool and courageous directors and writers. Richard Attenborough, as a director, never got very far, not further than this for sure. The most appealing feature lies in fact of, while being British, Attenborough embraces in a plot that blackens Great Britain's image very sharply. Anyway, that's a point in his favor, as the movie seemed very neutral on that matter. The beauty of his wiser words build a great movie, recommended not only for cinematographic reasons, but mainly philosophical, political and religious. It's this way because this movie doens't bright for technical effects or plot gymnastics. It's about the greatest man of the 20th century, and it's good. 10/10",Gandhi
126,wolverinesforever,"Long, but worth watching",8,7 April 2011,"Spanning from his days as a student in South Africa to his assassination in India, ""Gandhi"" recounts several events of the man's life. In South Africa, Gandhi (played terrifically by Ben Kingsley) fights against discrimination laws against Indians, but instructs his followers to fight non-violently. This will set a precedent for his return to India, where he travels the country, observes the state of the people, and takes on the discriminatory British laws one by one. Time and time again, the British authorities try to bring him down, but Gandhi continually growing support from his people make it harder to suppress his demands. However, when India's independence is increasingly becoming a reality, so is the fact that India could partition into two nations because of religious differences, something Gandhi fiercely opposes and has trouble trying to control.Of all the compliments and accolades that have gone to this movie, the most seem to be directed at Ben Kingsley, and for good reason. He is incredibly convincing as Gandhi, showing the great gravitas the man could hold when he was leading demonstrations of thousands. He also shows how committed Gandhi was to his views. Take, for example, the moment when a his friend Walker (Martin Sheen) comments to him, ""You're an ambitious man,"" and Gandhi replies, ""I hope not."" His response, though not forceful, still hits an odd nerve, as you wonder how someone who wants equality for his people in such a segregated state could not consider himself ""ambitious."" And yet, that response makes the rest of his actions in the movie make that much more sense. Though he is deeply committed to equality (and later, independence), he also believes it's an inherent right, not something you're born without. It's kind of surprising that Kingsley's track record after this film has been rather erratic, although he did have good turns in ""Schindler's List"" and ""Shutter Island.""Director Richard Attenborough wastes as few details as possible about Gandhi's life (there's even a title card early in the picture that acknowledges that not all of his life could be compressed into one movie). This, for the most part, is a good choice, since you're allowed to gradually see and understand how Gandhi got India to break away from Great Britain, and, eventually, struggled to keep it one nation. For the first 140 minutes or so, the film is pretty well paced, although it's reverential attitude towards Gandhi did make me wonder if there was something more complex behind his character. The last 40 minutes, while they make the movie drag, do at least challenge Gandhi's notions, as he is forced to confront the fact that his intelligent speeches and periods of long fasting will not be enough to alleviate a long religious conflict between Muslims and Hindus (which lead to the creation of Pakistan). Notice how, when Gandhi claims to be a man of all faiths, a Hindu, not a Muslim, later assassinated him.Though I think some trimming of the time could have helped, this is nonetheless a good looking and well acted epic and also intelligently addresses some issues that still affect us today. Do tyrants always fall? Or are the people who stand against them bound to fall as well? For me, that seemed to be the question the film posed at the end.",Gandhi

128,connorbbalboa,A simple collage of events and a big lie,3,22 January 2017,"As a film lover, I have recently gotten suspicious of biopics and historical films. These kinds of movies tend to sugarcoat the truth to present almost typical Hollywood stories, for instance, making some people who weren't all that bad, the main villains, simply so the audiences can identify an antagonist (The Aviator is a big offender in this category). Gandhi (1982) falls into many of the these traps that other biopics fall into and as a result, becomes an over- glorification, a complete lie, and something that almost doesn't resemble a story, but merely a collage of events.The film basically presents us with the major events of Gandhi's career: his time working against British oppression of Indians as a lawyer in South Africa, the Amritsar massacre, the March of Salt, Gandhi's assassination, etc. The events are simply presented, very accurately from what I read about them, but the film leaves out many things about him that weren't very noble. Reading about events in Gandhi's life from all different sources, like books and online articles, I can safely say that I am appalled by some of the things that this man has done.When fighting British oppression of Indians in South Africa, he basically ignored native South Africans that have lived in the country much longer than any Indian or British person. Second, he was cruel to his family, so much so that his son spoke out against him and later died as a drunk; he even negatively compared his own wife to a cow. Additionally, when his wife was sick, he refused to give her British medicine and yet was willing to take it himself when he had malaria. After Hitler came to power and WWII started, he wrote to Hitler, addressing him as a friend, and after the war was over, he himself said that many of the Jews from the Holocaust should have let themselves die and submit to the oppression of the Nazis. Any sensible man or woman would know that this is could be nothing more than an insane and horrible suggestion and that it would be simply impossible to deal with the Nazis using Gandhi's ideas. This was the Gandhi that so many people idolized? I even read an article from The Guardian saying that a biography about Gandhi was forbidden for publication because it revealed too many things about his life.Other than the fact that the film is lying to everyone who sees it, the film is just too preachy. It doesn't barrage you with moral lessons every second of screen time, but half of the dialogue is moral lessons and guidelines on life and doesn't feel very natural. Even in the beginning, when it shows Gandhi's funeral, an announcer covering the funeral outright tells the audience (indirectly) what to think of Gandhi and how others, like Albert Einstein viewed him, and that we should view him that way too. Richard Attenborough, the director and producer, was actually advised against glorifying Gandhi. I don't get why he didn't take that advice to heart, considering that this was a passion project to him. Even some of the British officials in the film act like two-dimensional bad guys. One of the only positive things I can say about this film is that Ben Kingsley nails it as this film's version of Gandhi. He makes me wish that the Gandhi that has been glorified by the world was a real person, instead of the flawed and sometimes frightening human being that actually existed on this Earth. The film also has a genuinely good message, but like I said, it's just turned into a preachy sermon throughout most of the movie.What else can I say? I was so disappointed to realize that so much of this man's life was left out and simplified simply to be more Hollywood-friendly and attract more crowds. That is complete BS. What a movie biopic should do, I think, is have the courage to present the uglier details of a person's life and as a result, feel more challenging. Plus, don't preach a moral lesson to us if a person lived by one, because that's being unsubtle. Let us figure it out for ourselves. Some of those things I said were applied in the excellent film, Raging Bull, by Martin Scorsese. Not only is the film mostly true to life, according to Jake LaMotta, whom the film was based on, but it wasn't afraid to portray LaMotta as a brute of a man like he was in his boxing heyday and it didn't outright tell you what to think of LaMotta or how he was thinking; instead, it kept you guessing with Robert De Niro's performance and the cinematography. Gandhi is just too afraid to turn a man who undeniably made major contributions to humanity into anything less than what people wish to see him as. As a result, this film is disgraceful and is too much of a piece of Oscar bait to be genuinely good. I'm sorry, members of the Academy, but you made a terrible choice for the Best Picture of 1982.",Gandhi

Then at the age of 13 when I watched the movie on TV I instantly fell in love with Mahatma. And now watching almost after a several years Gandhi left me with that same feeling of love for him I felt a years ago. Richard Attenborough's Gandhi have all those materials a good film should have. Even though if deeply criticized then the film might not be an eye-catcher for everyone due to the cliche-at-sometime screenplay I find. But Gandhi is not just a movie that makes us believe a person's unique philosophy but a tale that also appreciate the sacrifices of his nearer friends. Also the movie impacts British not as heartless villain but as with true delicacy and perfect human documentary. Never the movie goes too much to make it unbelievable neither it goes too low to feel not much for Bapu.The movie starts with the scene of death of Gandhiji. He is walking down the crowd. Everyone is greeting him. And a guy come to him, touches his feet and shot him getting up. That's the way the film starts. And it goes to the scene where Gandhi, as a young man travelling through the first class of a train and soon kicked out from there. The reason is his skin is brown and he can't be allowed to be travelling at first class. Soon from that day he starts noticing about the fact that how much hate exists in this world between people with different colour, cast and creed.Short, skinny and with no handsome face this man led India to Independence and became a idol of millions. Ben Kingsley's performance is so good that sometimes it's feel like watching a documentary. Tears, anger and emotions all that is showed in a perfect amount by Brilliant Mr.Kingslay. And as about the cinematography and score both are mind blowing. The moment at the Jalianwalabag was a intense piece of film clip. And as about those landscapes of running trains, green crop fields and the sun rays over the lake are amazing to look at not just for the moving camera but also for that amazing piece of soulful music that fulfils the scene with nostalgia.Above all, winner of 8 Oscar and million of people's heart both the movie and Gandhi, as a person leave an impact on my mind that wouldn't easily be forgettable.",Gandhi

I guess it boils down to respect, because Gandhi and his followers sure earned it! Richard Attenborough's remarkable skill as an actor translates well to directing. (Many of his films as an actor are outstanding pieces). Here, in the director's chair, he manages to obtain memorable and endearing performances from his cast. There's some delicious humor, too, that could have been lost amid the serious political issues Gandhi faced.The storyline and tone of the film is sensitive to one of India's most loved and respected national figures. There's sweeping panoramas of India's incredible landscapes, evocative shots of India's legendary Railways and well-orchestrated ""crowd scenes"" that many a film could never achieve with such grandeur.The script honestly portrays the problems Gandhi faced both at home and abroad.

What forces me to give this movie a 10/10 is one man:  Kingsley.  In his impassioned, restrained, and accurate portrayal of one of the most amazing men who ever lived, Kingsley, a relative unknown at the time, provides one of the most awe-inspiring performances that I have ever had the privilege to see, and most likely ever will see.  I recently read a post for this movie that stated that the viewer will forget that he is observing an actor portraying Gandhi and believe that he is viewing the Mahatma himself.  This is entirely accurate.  Ben Kingsley plays the Mahatma Gandhi with such heart and emotion that I, just for a second, found myself believing that I was watching a documentary.With his portrayal of Gandhi, Ben Kingsley has placed himself, along with Marlon Brando in the Godfather, Roberto Beignini in Life is Beautiful, Liam Neeson in Schindler's List, Bogart in Casablanca, Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, upon a pedestal reserved only for the most magnificent actors ever to grace the screen with their presence.

No.-(An Excerpt from an article by Sanjeev Nayyar, Hindustan Times)- It was none other than Lord Clement Atllee, the British Prime Minister responsible for conceding independence to India, who shattered the myth that Gandhi and his movement gave India freedom. Chief Justice P.B. Chakrabarty of the Calcutta High Court, who had also served as the acting Governor of West Bengal in India , disclosed the following in a letter addressed to the publisher of R.C. Majumdar's book 'A History of Bengal'. The Chief Justice wrote: ""My direct question to him was that since Gandhiji's Quit India movement had tapered off quite some time ago and in 1947 no such new compelling situation had arisen that would necessitate a hasty British departure, why did they have to leave? In his reply Atlee cited several reason, the principal among them being the erosion of loyalty to the British Crown among the Indian army and navy personnel as a result of the military activities of Netaji. Toward the end of our discussion I asked Atlee what was the extent of Gandhi's influence upon the British decision to quit India. Hering this question Atlee's lips became twisted in a sarcastic smile as he slowly chewed out the word, ""m-i-n-i-m-a-l!"" ('Subhash Chandra Bose, the Indian National Army, and the War of India's Liberation-Ranjan Borra', Journal of Historical Review, no. 3, 4, Winter 1982.) Atlee's thoughts were echoed by Fenner Brockway, political secretary of the Independent Labour Party of England, ""There were three reasons why India became free. One, the Indian people were determined to gain independence. Two, was the revolt by the Indian Navy. Three, Britain did not want to estrange India, which was a market and source of foodstuffs for her."" By the way, what did the concept of Ahimsa as expounded by Gandhi mean? ""When a person claims to be non-violent, he is expected not to be angry with one who has injured him. He will not wish him harm. he will not cause him physical hurt.Complete non-violence is complete absence of ill-will against all that lives.""(History and Culture of Indian People Vol. 11) Sir Aurobindo said on Ahimsa, ""You can live it in spiritual life, but to apply it to all life is absurd."" Gandhi did precisely that and more by stretching the ideology of Ahimsa to a ludicrous extent. Few know that even Britain braced itself to face a Nazi invasion in the mid-1940 Gandhi published an ""open letter"" to ""every Briton"" urging ""cessation of hostilities"". Excerpts: ""No cause, however just, can warrant the indiscriminate slaughter that is going on minute by minute... I do not want Britain to be defeated, nor do I want her to be victorious, in a trial of brute strength... I want you to fight Nazism without arms.""(H. M. Seervai, noted constitutional authority, in 'Introduction' pp.143-144 of his book 'Constitutional Law of India', Supplement to Third Edition, 1988) Speaking on the Defence Budget in the Lok Sabha in 1957 noted Gandhian, Acharya Kriplani said in the Lok Sabha, ""The mounting expenses on the Indian Army must be cut down. The followers of Gandhi and adherents of universal peace should not increase military expenditure."" What followed was the humiliation of the 1962 in the war against China's invasion of India.Gandhi had admirable qualities but the problem was that he wanted to be everything to everyone. With Tilak's death in 1920 he assumed leadership of the Hindus. Through the Khilafat movement in 1921 he tried to enlist the Muslims. When Ambedkar championed the cause of the Depressed Classes he sought to become their leader too and coined the term 'Harijan' .

I hate to admit it but before I watched this movie I knew essentially nothing about him. I knew he was an important leader in the liberation of India from England's rule but the real implication of his actions throughout his life had never really been brought to my attention. To understand Gandhi a person has to study a fifty-year period of history that includes both major events in India as well as Africa. This is where the film really shines; it takes all these events and presents them concisely by focusing on Gandhi and relating the events he was involved in to him instead of starting with the events and including the players as almost an afterthought the way many text books would. This makes the information easily accessible for anyone regardless of foreknowledge. The film opens with 300,000 extras attending Gandhi's funeral, more than any movie made before or since, to capture the scope of how revered he really was. These people are packed along the street as his coffin is moved through the city suggesting far greater numbers as if everyone in India was there. As this spectacle is being shown a radio station reporter's monologue played. He is trying to put into words, overwhelmed but still very articulate, how extraordinarily important the life that had just ended was to the world. He notes that Gandhi never held a political office, was not a religious leader, and never held any authoritarian title and yet people followed him with an unrivaled dedication.The way he used hunger strikes and risked his own health to keep the protest from becoming riots by starving himself until people behaved is shown in a way that articulates his actions and motives perfectly. The way the film addresses the problems faced by the cotton farmers really reminds me of the way films such as the GRAPES OF WRATH, BOUND FOR GLORY and many others depict the struggles of farmers during the depression in America. The film also shows how India's sovereignty leads to the formation of Pakistan by India's Islamic minority, something that I was not familiar with before seeing the movie. Director, Richard Attenborough (perhaps best known by audiences as the Colonel Sanders impersonating proprietor of Jurassic Park) struggled for over twenty years to get support for this movie to be made and it couldn't have been any better if he had spent every day of those twenty some ought years creating this film. So much information is presented here with a degree of accuracy that is almost never seen in a Hollywood production (THE DOORS, it's like a slap in the face for their fans;) I'm truly surprised it's not used as a teaching tool in all history classes. More than its informative value, this movie is a fitting a tribute to the man who is the figurehead for peaceful protest, pacifism, and all positive changes is government policy. He was a person who didn't need a legend because his factual acts outdid any possible fallacies and I learned most of what I know about him from this movie.",Gandhi
139,daniel-ambia,Couldn't they have found an Indian actor,8,23 January 2007,"The story of Mohandas Ghandi is one that needed to be told through film perhaps several years earlier during the height of the civil rights movement when it could have helped enlighten more people. The cameo by a young Daniel Day Lewis is priceless. Two generations of academy award winners meet on a dusty street set in south Africa. I gave this movie an eight out of ten because it is truly an impressive piece of work. But a part of me is puzzled. Kevin Costner found authentic native Americans when he filmed dances with wolves. Mel Gibson managed to scrounge up the finest in Scottish talent for Braveheart. Why couldn't they find the perfect Indian to play Ghandi, perhaps the most influential Hindu in history? There are thousands of Indian actors the cast directors could have picked from and most Indians, due to years of colonization, speak English better then most Americans. Don't get me wrong, Sir Ben Kingsley is a fine actor and deserved the awards he received for the role. I am simply speculating when I wonder why they picked a British man whose ancestors probably helped invade and exploit India instead of an authentic Indian. That's all.",Gandhi

There is much more action in this film as there is in The Matrix which indeed appears monotonous and boring after several times. it is not a matter of watching exploding helicopter but rather hearing and seeing a small poor man making the English shale in their boots after they realize how wrong their Civilization Dogmas are. I guess Gandhi is much underrated as most disturbing films might be. Concerning the actors, Ben Kingsley is actually astonishing and, until I sawthe beginning of this film, then ""Dave"", I seriously thought he was around 60 years old. That also goes for the make-up artists. Gandhi is one of my all-time favorites and truely desserves to be broadcasted in School in order to teach children how far from the truth their education leads them.",Gandhi

Gandhi excels in this measure. Ben Kingsley, who is one of my all-time favourite actors, is bang-on in this wonderful bio that captures the political triumphs and conflicts that surround a man without money or earthly possessions. The length of the film should not be a bias in seeing this marvelous film.

For those who found it ""boring"" or ""too long,"" you folks need to just stick to stuff like ""Star Wars,"" ""Terminator,"" ""Spiderman,"" or perhaps reality TV would be more your cup of tea.For those who like to actually see real human history come to life on the screen, ""Gandhi"" is a true masterpiece for all times. A excellent summary of one of the greatest and most interesting lives of the 20th. century!I find it odd that aside from a fine performance in ""Shindler's List,"" that Ben Kingsley has really been a major disappointment as an actor following his role as ""Gandhi."" Perhaps like George C. Scott in ""Patton,"" he was destined to play just one truly great role as an actor. And this was it!For those who keep mentioning that Kingsley is ""English,"" well, yes he is, but he is also ""Anglo-Indian."" His father is from India. In fact his father was born in the same small sea-coast town as Mahatma Gandhi! While filming the movie in the small towns of rural India, there were those older people who actually remembered seeing the original Gandhi who collapsed in shock when they saw Kingsley in his makeup. Hundreds became convinced that he actually was the Mahatma, returned! Also interesting is that Kingsley was born just after the asassination of Gandhi.

Ben Kingsley's transformation into the young lawyer Gandhi and progression to the Great Soul Gandhi are excellent! Likewise, the film's depiction of Gandhi's humility and heart for people -- how he listens to and tends to the needs of his countrymen while encouraging peaceful protest -- are inspiring!",Gandhi

Where is the nuance and realism. One example is the scene where the Indians were staging a non violent protest, and are then viciously mowed down by the evil British. Not only do they have all the Indians in white, but not ONE of them is doing anything wrong, no one causing any trouble at all, just all innocent, law abiding, smiles on their faces innocents. I've been to the best of rallies and it's NEVER that way. This was just too over the top in order to make a point, and I saw too many instances of this in the film. To me, that is always insulting to the audience that you can't make up your own mind and must be spoonfed who the ""good"" guys and ""bad"" guys are. I expected more from a movie with Ben Kingsley. Scenery was good, but I wish they had not made such caricatures of the Indians and of the British.",Gandhi

This is an amazing film that anyone of any religion, race, or nationality can and should appreciate. With its subtle relevance to today's situations in that part of the world, this is a history buff must-see.Watch this film and see great performances (an obvious oscar went to Ben Kingsly), excellent cinematography, and a wonderful inspiring story, whose essence soars well above the corny, do-gooder mentality of other pitiful efforts of ""bio-pics"".10/10",Gandhi

Gandhi movie has splendid script with proper direction. As the movie based o the real events of British Raj in India the movie has succeeded to provide the actual drama and consequences of British democracy against Indian public. If you want to know what was really happened during the British rule? then I would suggest you this movie, not because of being based on Gandhi but the best standards of its content. This movie may not motivate you but yes it will definitely coerce you to think about the consequences of Indians during the British empire. The director has taken more than 18 years to make story by taking interview of many actual British officers and close ones of Gandhi Ji.

He was a powerful Indian leader who used peaceful tactics to free India from The British Empire. To this day, Gandhi is viewed as one of the greatest political leaders in the 20th Century. As a movie, Gandhi succeeds bog time. Director Richard Attenborough had a 20 year dream of making a movie about Gandhi, and he creates a powerful epic unlike any other, about as strong as the epics of David Lean. The cinematography is beautifully sweeping, there's tons of extras throughout that would likely be CGI today, and the best part, Ben Kingsley's performance as the title character. When we witness his reactions to tragic events, Kingsley makes it so authentic that we believe that the real Gandhi has returned from the dead. There were some parts, such as the reaction that I mentioned involving the slaughter of innocent civilians, that actually made me weep during these emotionally powerful moments. And that's what I want to see in an epic movie. Something that's exceptionally realistic and emotionally powerful. And that's what Gandhi succeeds as a film.",Gandhi

155,kartiknnagar,"The story of a great man, the birth of a nation",9,14 April 2018,"'Gandhi' is a comprehensive biographical sketch of one of the greatest men of contemporary times, and certainly the greatest man in the history of India. It also dutifully covers almost all the major events of India's independence struggle from the rule of the British Empire. In spite of being an historical account, the movie is by no means dry or pedantic, and it covers a large span of years with perfect pacing, often being witty, moving, humorous, thought-provoking and sprinkled with large doses of Gandhiji's famous messages.It is ironic that a Britisher would create such a moving and heartfelt portrayal, and it does hurt the credibility of the movie that every one is speaking in perfect English (even Gandhiji's famous last words are in English). Having said that, the movie is completely successful in exploring the life and character of Gandhiji, and in providing a faithful overview of the difficulties involved in the birth of India.India's independence struggle was unique, and Gandhiji's idea of non-violent non co-operation and shaming the Britishers by attacking their good image and appealing to their sense of morality and honour was a master stroke. As a person, all of Gandhiji's admirable qualities are on full display here : he was a man of strong conviction, an iron will, a sharp intellect and complete dedication to the cause of a strong, independent India.To be honest, the events portrayed in the movie are so far in the past that it is easy to debate about the importance of Gandhiji's non-violent movement in hindsight : India would probably have gained its independence sooner or later since the Britishers had suffered massive losses in the Second World War, but without Gandhiji, it is hard to guess whether would it have been more violent or less violent, and what values and principles we Indians as a nation would have inherited. It is also debatable how much of those values and principles that Gandhiji so strongly advocated have survived in the present time. All that said, it is certainly beyond debate that MK Gandhi was a great man, and his philosophy and his pivotal role in the birth of India will always be remembered.",Gandhi
156,karmela,'ghandi' in 2001,10,30 December 2001,"this great epic has  - without any doubt - exquisite value as an achievement in the field of moviemaking. the movie is really great by every means and has definitely deserved all the nine academy awards it had won back in 1982. one watches it, breathless, for all three hours, as if it was just 15 minutes long. but there's more. after 9-11 and all the things we have seen happen recently, this great biopic about this extraordinary man is especially worth recommending. it is worth seeing especially for this one line ghandi says in the film: 'eye for an eye will make the whole world blind'.",Gandhi
157,elkabousmehdi,"""An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind""",7,21 May 2010,"I was engrossed yesterday to watch such a colorful big movie, that has in itself some of the majors constituents of what can make an epic movie larger-than-life, yet It was about a historical iconic person that made things easier for Richard Attenborough to succeed conveying the humanistic and charismatic features that Gandhi was Known by.The film has 8 Oscars in its awards cabinet, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Ben Kingsley), Best Editor, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Screenplay (John Briley) and Best costume design, all of these awards emphatically confirm the importance and the highly praised regards that this movie brought once it was released, I can stand as an advocate for the Oscar committee for this One, it was certainly taken as a biopic educational medium that spans the life story of one of the most important man in history : the Hindu Mohandas K Gandhi.Richard Attenborough was certainly a profound admirer of Gandhi's personality; we can feel his joy and excitement in depicting the instances where Gandhi faced the merciless British authorities in what he painstakingly elaborated an fluid eloquence of speech between the British and Him, the unofficial Indian leader. Richard Made it clear at the beginning of the movie.Gandhi faced racial discrimination in a ''British'' train in south Africa, where He was asked to get out of the train even though he has a First class ticket, nonetheless Gandhi hasn't at all plunged into despair and instinctive violent revolt but went to contact and communicate the issue to his fellow people that are facing the same people and stood head to head against the British Authorities to raise the problematic question that occurred at that period which is ''The illicit imperialistic impact made upon the laws and commonwealth of the colonized countries"" . Gandhi came back to his country, where he engraved his name as an unofficial leader of the masses of people of different ethnicities. In the court scene, in the presence of some British officers, Gandhi spoke to his fellows Hindus and Muslims about how they are not considered citizens of the empire, everyone enraged at the idea of letting the British harm them, let them embody the pain that they inflict, and by then they'll see that there is something wrong, something that won't suit neither their interest nor ours the Indians'.Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence disobedience is for sure and certain one of the maverick philosophies of nonviolent resistance, it seems somewhat naive and irrational but it conquered the British Empire. I've been taken much by the personality, but this film wouldn't stand on its feet if there wasn't the magnificent and poignant performance by Ben Kingsley (half Indian), he overshadowed all the others actors, he embodied Gandhi who is a leading role not that easy as it seems, but he nails it, he didn't fall into the cliché/traps of heroic nonsense speeches, on the contrary he was charismatic, and reflecting a Tranquil Force.Towards the end of the movie, Gandhi succeeded to give independence to India through his nonviolence philosophy, nonetheless it didn't prevent India from facing a bitter civil war between the Muslim party and Hindu party, about which the aging Gandhi said '' I am a Muslim and a Hindu and a Christian and a Jew and so are all of you.'', Even though Gandhi was the principal cause for India's independence, the evilness inherited in people's souls made them forget all his great deeds, whereupon an angry dissident assassinates the 78-years-old with a bullet, a mere bullet!! Notwithstanding the length of the movie which is a 3hours 14minutes, the pace of the movie is excellent, I much enjoyed the blank black scene image, wherein only Indian mystical music could be heard (I went to the kitchen to bring me something to eat, and listened to it while enjoying my food Ha:D).Gandhi was killed, a person who sought ''nonviolence'' was faced by an extreme inexplicable ''VIOLENCE'', Whereas this film certainly paid tribute to one of the important icons in history, it's a documentary about Gandhi's philosophy of the resistance through nonviolence and humanistic approach that will spread nothing but peace and love.",Gandhi

Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies, nor the ruler of vast lands.  He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift.  Yet men, governments, dignitaries from all over the world, have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth, who led his country to freedom.""This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film ""Gandhi"".  Richard Attenborough directed this massive epic about the man that freed India. The film opens with Gandhi's assassination.  The next scene, his funeral, is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history. Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi's funeral on January 31st, 1981, the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral.  It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation. This film was made before CGI (computer generated images), so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed.
Mahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art.  This film has made and will make millions of people aware of the little brown man that took on the British Empire and won.  ""Gandhi"" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history.
Ben Kingsley played Gandhi.  He was the perfect for the role.  He resembled the real Gandhi.  He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man. He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent.   He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part. And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time, so the ""big-time actor"" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film.  He did win both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor, for this role, which I agree he deserved.  He became Gandhi.The cinematography was outstanding.  Attenborough filmed ""Gandhi"" on location in India.  The scenes of India are spectacular, and India is very much another character in the film.  This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi.  Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta.  It is suggested by Kingsley, on the DVD, that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming.  They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman.  Undeterred by their negative thinking, he persevered to enlist thousands of Indians to help make this film.  Every crowd scene, he used real Indians from the area. Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.This movie is a must see for everyone.  It should be required viewing in high schools, as part of History class.  The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant.  It is also a beautiful work of art.  This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood (see ""Pearl Harbor"" for that). Of course, it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man. 10/10",Gandhi

The unbiased characterized story of ""Gandhi"" just amazing! This one finest movie only deserves 10/10 with flawless acting by everyone.

Over the years I have grown up with this movie, periodic telecasts on the national network on his birthdays etc.What can I say, the acting, the sets, the story , the directing...is par excellence. Ben Kingsley is Gandhi.It is a monumental effort which attempts to trace the evolution of a barrister in South Africa in creased shirt and trousers to the Mahatma in khadi who taught not only the British and the Indians but the entire world that we all are bound with one thread and that is humanity.Thank you Richard Attenborough....!!!",Gandhi

It starts off briefly with his time in South Africa, continues with his fight for Indian independence, followed by his fast during the Muslim-Hindu violence after gaining said independence, and ends with his death by murder.I enjoyed every part of it. What a truly fascinating and inspiring man he was. I learned so much from this movie and I loved it. I learned about Gandhi, of course, but also about the history of India and Pakistan. When he fasted in protest against the Muslim-Hindu violence and finally succeeded, and everyone was standing around him saying that it had stopped, it brought tears to my eyes. What a powerful moment.One small complaint about the movie that I have is that it shows his death in the beginning, which I felt was a bit unnecessary. I actually did not know that Gandhi was murdered before watching the film.In all honesty however, if I would solely rate the movie based on it's quality I would probably give it a 7. It is the fact that it is about Mahatma Gandhi which makes it a 9 for me.I think everyone should see this film.

The emotion, which ranges from humor to pathos, is so seamless and real that you feel you are watching history as it unfolds. It is also painstakingly accurate from a historical perspective, so it has excellent educational value as well.I have given several movies a 10 rating, but Gandhi is my favorite movie of all time. It can do more than merely entertain you. It can change your life. Its message of courageous yet non-violent opposition to tyranny as the most effective means for ensuring positive and lasting social change is, in my view, among the most important lessons any of us can learn.",Gandhi

He was a great man who brought down the British Empire . He brought it to its knees and gave our nation freedom not by using Weapons, not by violence, not by killing but by Civil disobedience and nonviolent protest.After his death, rest of African nations got their independence by his inspiration. Nelson Mandela ended Racism in South Africa inspired by him. The Blacks of America earned their much delayed Racial equality inspired by Gandhi.Such great Souls rarely appear on this earth and appear only once in a generation.Did Gandhi succeed?..........Mightily YES. Imagine you have a vast subjugated population with no literacy, no money, no brains and no propaganda tool and you are left with a task to bring down the superpower. Would you succeed.....or would you EVEN DARE to take up such a task?.Gandhiji succeeded in that and succeeded in a big way.Did Gandhi Fail?......Yes he failed in 1 of his endeavors. He wanted Freedom but not at the expense of Hindu-Muslim Unity. India was divided against his wishes. He failed in persuading Jinnah and Nehru to be together. India was divided and till this day Pakistan and India fight for the silliest possible reasons that man can ever comprehend. Though I might add that Gandhi had planned to visit Pakistan and perhaps who knows he might have reversed partition. But sadly someone killed him. People blame that Hindu right wing killed Gandhi. That at least is the Indian National congress story. Yes, he was killed by Nathuram Godse. But who instigated him is the question.The only thing I know is that it was in the interests of many people not least the British, the West, Nehru and Indian National congress to keep the partition intact. So no one will ever know who killed him.Gandhi wanted village economy, Swadeshi and self economic development. All that is lost today. We are a client state of America. Our economy, our defense is dependent on America. National news and private news channel cover about one Court case in a particular city and that makes National headlines. What about the 70% of India which lives in their villages. Why don't the farmer suicides, the farmer troubles, the issues of farmers make national headlines???

Now watching again, I a going to tell you I am even more impressed! I mean , that is impossible to act like that when a war is happening!.. Or at least it ""was"" impossible until Ghandi proved the contrary. In Fact I still can't believe that this can be done again. It is necessary to be too much illuminated and to have a lot of luck too.. and I think people like him appears once in a millennium..

The movie is given a perfect 10 score here in part due to logistics, one of the most non-understood elements by critics and audiences, who have taken movie production completely for granted in today's age where scenery is created not on sets, but on computers. That said, it gains only 1 mark of 10 for this. I reserve the balance score for the performance of Ben Kingsley, who was hands-down winner of Best Actor for 1982, and the tremendous effort to movie making brought forth by Richard Attenborough.This film is shot in the tradition of Lawrence of Arabia, or The Greatest Story Ever Told, or 10 Commandments, or even Gone With the Wind.

So I was eager to watch this in my World Religions class.Sir Ben Kingsley gives the performance of a lifetime as Gandhi, ""The Little Man in the Loin Cloth"".

176,jvalant,Great Movie,10,22 January 2001,"Let me clear a few doubts that the viewers have posted on this movie.1. That Ben Kingsley is a British actor - he is indeed a British actor, but of Indian origin - his real name is Krishna Bhanji. His depiction of Gandhi has indeed made all Indians proud.2. Some people are complaining about the treatment Jinnah's character got during the movie. The depiction of Jinnah is perfect. He was single handedly responsible for the deaths of millions in the partition riots and uprooted the life of 11 million people in British India.3. Indian Muslims are Indian citizens and have always been treated fairly by the secular and democratic Indian govt. In fact in 1965, during the Indo-Pak war, a lot of the Indian Council meetings were chaired by an Indian Muslim, because of the illness of the Indian PM. Moreover, during that war, Dr.Zakir Hussein, an Indian Muslim was the President of India. Jinnah's only grandson is a proud Indian citizen and CEO of one of the only Indian Fortune 500 companies in the world. Moreover, Jinnah's two-nation was aptly buried in 1971 when after the Pakistani Army massacred 3 million Muslim East Pakistanis and the nation of Bangladesh was formed after India's military intervention.Even though these issues may not seem related to the movie Gandhi - they actually are - Gandhi stood for peace and equality irrespective of caste, creed or religion and thanks to his efforts today India is today the world's largest democracy and the world's largest secular country. Of course, there have been a few hiccups like Babri mosque demolition in India but in a country of 1 billion people, not everyone is exactly the same - would it be fair to label all white Americans as racists because of one Rodney King incident?",Gandhi
177,dbohr,Kingsley's best work,10,24 July 2002,"Ben Kingsley is an outstanding actor, and portraying Gandhi is his most outstanding work.  He shows the young man shocked to see what is happening to his fellow Indians who go to Africa, the idealist trying to form the Ashram in his home country, the leader standing up to the English, and the aging man distraught over the conflict between the religious groups in India.But this movie is worth seeing for other reasons as well.  The rest of the cast turn in A+ performances.  The film is extensive enough to show most of the key moments in Gandhi's life.  The epic scale of certain scenes are all the more impressive considering that today's modern computer technology was not used to depict the large crowds.The sequence leading up to and including the Great Salt March is one of the most moving scenes in film.10/10",Gandhi

Eventhough the director simplifies Gandhi and the Indian Nationalist movement, he does do a good job in giving you a Idea of what Gandhi stood for. It would have helped if he also highlighted some of Gandhi's weak points. Gandhi's whole phiolsophy about human beings was that no one is perfect and each one of us must search for the truth.

The leading role was played by Ben Kingsley who did a superb job and deserved the Oscar that he won for portraying this Gandi. The films also had a great cast with stars like John Gielgud, Martin Sheen and John Mills to name a few. I found this film very moving Kingsley played the part of Gandi so convincingly that it is hard to believe that he is not actually Gandhi but an actor. The end and beginning of the film when Gandhi is killed is a very powerful moment in this film. It made me sad to see Gandhi die he was such a nice and important person in the film.

What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and to try to find one's way to the heart of the man, This gem in biographic cinema exactly does that and sketches Gandhi's life.Movie starts as M.k Gandhi in his youth, after becoming attorney comes to South . Africa (1893) . He was thrown out of the train for sitting in the first class being an Indian. After his bitter welcome which took him completely by surprise , he starts his fight for the rights of Indians while protesting against the pass law and being successful . Then flick shifts the focus on his return to India (1915) and how he sacrificed his life in India's freedom struggle and at last India won freedom through his non - violence movements i.e, Champaran movement, non- cooperation movement, burning of foreign clothes , salt march etc. Flick is able to successfully sketch the pain Gandhi suffered while accepting a separate nation Pakistan what made him to took that decision and how that decision become the reason for his assassination .Richard Attenborough fought the world to make this movie, as he struggled for monitory help. He even sold his share of the ownership from famous English play ""The Mousetrap"". Richard Attenborough pushed Ben Kingsley to his limits for taking out acting performance of a lifetime by Ben Kingsley as Gandhi. Ben is of Indian origin that surely helped his performance, he was so into his role that during the shoot many natives thought him to be Gandhi's ghost. The beautiful screenplay by John Briley and good work by supporting cast , all doing justice to their characters this movie in a complete package.There is very little to write about the flaws . Some of them were , The South African police were shown both arresting and beating Gandhi for burning passes during his protest of the Pass Law. although in reality Gandhi and his fellow protesters were arrested for burning the passes, but were not beaten . And its bit odd when we see Ben as Gandhi addressing Indian mass in English , the movie would have been more real if those parts were in Hindi.There are not many movies which are a must - see for all irrespective of the nationality , languages , cultures or sex , this masterpiece is one of them . If compared this masterpiece with other famous biographic gems like the ''Shindler's List"" or "" Beautiful mind "" they fall behind in terms of effect this movie cause to masses.

If you know absolutely nothing about Gandhi, as I did, this movie is an absolute must see for anyone who wants to know about him. Thanks to the direction of Richard Attenborough and the incredible performance given by Kingsley in the title role, this movie paints a complete picture of who Gandhi was! It depicts who he was as a leader, as a man, and as a husband. The film paints a picture of him that is the absolute truth: He was a man who won India its independence from Britain without killing a single person. One of the most remarkable things about this film is the way it depicts Gandhi's actions when the people he loved so much fought with each other. Whenever violence started to occur, he would fast until it stopped. His people loved him so much for all he did for them that they stopped their violent behavior to save his life. This movie is so powerful in that it makes you love, admire, and respect the man that Gandhi was. You rejoice with him when he triumphs, and you grieve with him when he suffers. This film won Attenborough an Oscar for his directing, Kingsley one for his acting, and won Best Picture. It deserved all three. If you would like to meet Gandhi, watch this film!

I am truly glad to have seen this movie, because I really didn´t know enough about this fascinating man. The visuals, music and sound design are all fitting and well crafted. This movie did age really well too. The performances are great all around. The pacing was a minor negative for me.

187,jjamele,Unnecessary Characters,5,10 February 2007,"This is one-half of a great movie. I say this because the film's second half is marred by the unfortunate appearance of tacked-on characters who seem to serve no other purpose than to give face time to a few actors and actresses, all of whom I hope paid for the privilege of being in this movie.Especially grating are the appearances of Geraldine James as Gandhi's adopted daughter Meerabaham and Candice Bergen as a photographer (in the film's last 40 minutes no less.) James's only function in the film is to speak softly and worshipfully and to gaze at Kingsley's character for several seconds at a time. Why on earth her inclusion in this film was seen as necessary totally escapes me. She has nothing of substance to say and just takes up space. Bergen's photographer is even worse- her appearance so late in the film simply makes no sense unless Bergen slipped some money under the table to the producer. She actually subtracts from the film by playing Candice Bergen rather than any character the viewer could possibly care about.I wont include Martin Sheen in this group, because he does appear early in the film, then vanishes for roughly two hours before reappearing near the film's end. However, I found it striking that the makeup crew was apparently not informed that some thirty years were supposed to have passed between meetings of Sheen's character and Kingsley's. Sheen's character really ought to be pushing seventy by the time he reappears, but he doesn't look a day past fifty.",Gandhi

Although India had got her independence from the British Raj, Mahatma Gandhi was not satisfied and he did not want a partition between India and Pakistan. Some people did not agree with his actions and turned against him. This led to his death in January 1948 where he was shot three times. The movie is the portrayal of a great man who did a lot for the survival of Indians who wanted independence.

He has admitted in his book that he was having sex while his father was dying. He admitted this when he was  known as Mahatma (a great soul). Who can dare to admit such a thing. He vowed that he will never lie in his life. Is it possible for you and me not to lie in life? He took vow about his cloths and wore same cloths (he was half naked in those cloths) while he was in London in winter!!!  Just imagine a freedom fight against Britain without any kind of weapon or violence!!! And he was successful. He gave freedom to India without any army. In fact his principles should be followed in today's world. I must say this movie was not enough to describe his principle. He was more than movie GANDHI. No body can capture his principles in a movie. For me he is like GOD because of his principles.GANDHI: "" My life is my message"".

People were to some extant moral. However they were week and submissive. Upholding morality guided by religious scriptures (esp. Bagavad Gita) combined with strong will power made wonders. People wonder whether was he right in many issues. After 20 years of study about his life I came to this conclusion that every thought and action were perfectly right with respect to the time, place and occasion that he was subjected to. His life and teachings should be grouped into two ways. One eternal message (eg. Be the change you want to be) and the second temporal messages (eg. burning British cloths during non-cooperation movement). Considering temporal message as eternal one and hence arguing against his personality should be considered as rubbish and childish. His life is a message his thoughts are godly.

193,thomasgilmore1962,A rare piece of history.,10,11 December 2012,"When you have a legendary world icon how do you possibly make a movie that does that person justice. This movie is probably as close as you can get to a perfect movie even one on a man like Gandhi. The way a man who was not wealthy, no property, no title or office, wasn't a commander of a military or any kind of ruler. Yet millions choose to follow him to freedom. You have governments, people all around the world celebrate and join hands to a man who freed his country through non violence. This movie is and was such a epic undertaking in a time before cgi, the funeral at the end was probably the last live action crowd of that size and same with rest of the movie. The last scene was probably one of the greatest scenes of cinematic history. Gandhi's message of non violent resistance is showed as a enthralling piece of art. This serves as entertainment and one of most historical figures in the world that took on the British Empire and won. Kingsley was perfect for the role of Gandhi, he nailed the British influenced Indian accent perfectly. He won both the Academy award and Golden Globe for best actor, he didn't just play Gandhi he became him. With the skillful cinematography and scenes in the movie it was as if India became a character in the film rather then just a location. Reading about the making of the movie and the trouble they had with the elite class in the country that a Englishman was making the movie. They were steadfast and were able to enlist thousands of Indians to help with the creation of this film, the crowds used real Indians from that area. It was very captivating how such a work of art can reach the epic proportions that make this almost nothing less then a miracle. The interpretation by Kingsley is nothing but astonishing and should go down as one of more perfect cinema roles. Watching this you almost forget that you are seeing a actor playing a part, your watching a part of history. This movie has everything the crowd scenes, the intimate and emotional scenes all captured beautifully. You aren't watching the scenes you are living and feeling them. The music makes you sympathize and show admiration adding so many other feelings you don't have in movies. Unlike some embellishments from Hollywood when it comes to history movies this is not one of those. A work of art that should be a required viewing for class as the fight of prejudice will be forever relevant in our generation.",Gandhi
194,balajiviswanathan,Glad that the film was made by a non-Indian,10,19 May 2010,"Like most Indians of the present generation, I grew up hating both Gandhi - the film and the great man. Like ""sound of music"" and ""It's a wonderful Life"" in the US, ""Gandhi"" is a routine in Indian Television. But, like a man who knows not the importance of water while sitting amidst plenty, I didn't care about it. In India, Hindus hate him because he gave too much to the Muslims, Muslims hate him because he was a religious Hindu and overshadowed Jinnah, leaders of the downtrodden hate him because he overshadowed their leader Ambedkar, socialists hate him because he didn't attack capitalism enough... in short most Indians misunderstand and hate him, and I was filled with all their propaganda. But, I was shocked when I spent time at an Amsterdam youth hostel where non-Indian students took great interest in Gandhi. So, I revisited the movie and realized what I missed. Gandhi brilliantly captures the life of a great soul. It has got some spectacularly great scenes - the salt satygraha, the resistance in South Africa against horse mounted cops and most importantly the court scene where even the judge rises up at the entry of the accused. Gandhi was relatively Western in his outlook (atleast initially) -he borrowed ideas from Thoreau, Tolstoy, Paine and others and the movie was quite faithful to it. The movie is pretty historically accurate and enthralls for the whole of 190 minutes. I don't know of any Indian director who could have done justice to this movie/character. If you have not watched Gandhi due to a propaganda, you are missing one of the most beautiful movies and an experience of a lifetime.",Gandhi

British people also bring new medicine and help very impoverish areas with new technology unknown to Indian world. Trade also work both ways as many Indian people introduce to the product from Europe. Also quality of life improve maybe not for all Indian citizen but every one family improved mean the one step better. Very large shame since would of been interesting to see how area would be like today if British people continue to make India more modern. Even today health of citizens very low and high birth rates continue to make problems for not just area but entire planet and planet's resources. Many of current problems in India the British could of help solve if still able to administer after all this time. Another area of problem in the sub continent were British administration could of help is in the field of crime. Same could be said of other fields but too numerous to list in this computer forum.

I realized life was about striving to become a better human being. The music of this movie was my first exposure to Indian music. The raw emotions in the music ripped me apart. No sugar coating, this is real. I hope every man, woman and child gets to see this movie in their life, for Gandhi can move us towards becoming better human beings. I should be part of school curriculum, just like Shakespeare and the Pythagorean theorem.

198,a-fisher,Critical Historical Viewing of Ghandi,8,15 September 2008,"Ghandi is useful for someone learning about the history of apartheid. It shows the experiences of an Indian (or Coloured) person in South Africa, which is beneficial because most representations focus on Black South Africans being victims of Apartheid. The Apartheid policies and racism towards Coloured people are shown, especially in Gahandi being thrown off the train and abused by white people. In the movie the character of Ghandi is central, and he is a very likable character. By focusing on him the viewer might be forced made to feel emotional about Apartheid policies. Watching this movie became very attached to the character of Ghandi and very angry about the racism of apartheid. Some people might suggest that this is a bad thing because it makes people emotional and they focus less on the facts of the history. But it is also quite good because the facts of the history are emotional. Focussing on a likable character like this is might help people to better understand how terrible it was in South Africa during apartheid. When viewing this movie we need to be critical. I explained that the audience easily becomes emotionally involved. This can be helpful for someone learning about apartheid because it makes them more interested and enthusiastic. But it can also cause problems because it stops the viewer from being objective about the truth. When we watch movies like this we need to be aware that this is happening, and not totally get sucked in by the emotion. In addition, this movie would have been more useful if it had had more information on South Africa. Unfortunately Ghandi leaves to go to India quite early in the movie, so we never really get to see that much. It would be better if the audience were shown more examples of apartheid segregation policies and the attitudes of more of the white people. Overall, this was an emotional movie  but one which let you understand how terrible apartheid was for many people. - Al, Jason and Eliot",Gandhi
199,ironflag1,"Sometimes Informative, Hard to Finish",6,15 January 2012,"From the onset I will admit that I am not well-versed in the life of Gandhi. That said, I expected more of this film. I was met with a marginalized look at the life of a richly genuine man.Perhaps it's because I'm a young adult born of an incredibly violent generation, but the portrayal of Gandhi's nonviolence comes off weak. The amount of love Gandhi shared for those around him comes off fake. The amount of trust the impoverished Indian people put in Gandhi seems staged. Of course, we all know coming in that this is just a film, but I believe this film did a poor job of capturing all the emotion that existed throughout Gandhi's lifetime. In fact, I am still left confused as to why Gandhi succeeded in South Africa and in India. Like I said, maybe I am disillusioned by being raised in a violently apathetic culture, but it seems absurd that an entire country would stop fighting simply because one man went on a fast. It seems similarly absurd that peasants who make up the majority of a country would leave behind their only source of income and food only to actively and knowingly accept violence from the British.This does not seem absurd because I can't imagine it happening, it seems absurd because this film does an entirely terrible job of creating the emotion and charisma that Gandhi had in order to inspire people to do these amazing things and to instigate these amazing changes.If you're looking for a deep view into the soul of Gandhi, like I was, you'll be disappointed. If you want a cute 3 hour Hollywood ""bio"" pic, well you've found it...",Gandhi
200,FredDobbin,"Few film biogs are brilliant. Lawerence, Patton and Gandhi are the three best ever.",10,4 September 2003,"The restrictions of movie making, together with the time constraints of theatrical release make a truly in-depth biography of a well known figure very hard to condense into two or three hours. An almost impossible task, for most. Richard Attenborough, with the dedicated focus and indefatigable effort of nearly twenty years, has brought a truly epic grandeur, mixed with humble simplicity, to the story of a amazing, mighty little man (my description of Gandhi, not I think anyone elses). It appears to me, that everyone associated with the making of this film, approached their task with a sincerity and compassion rarely seen today. This film is in the very top echelon. A must see for every man woman and child on our troubled planet. As Ben Kingsley himself said, 'The last of the great film epics.' No digitised imagery or fakery. Close to 400,000 people did actually participate in the funeral sequence, a measure of Attenborough's stature in the world of film, but more importantly, a measure of how much Gandhi's memory and legacy remains in India and the world.",Gandhi
201,ranganatheunny,Well made movie,10,12 March 2006,"On the night of the 71st Academy Awards (1999), Norman Jewison, who received the Irving Thalberg Award told movie-makers to ""just tell stories that move us to laughter or tears and perhaps tell us a bit about ourselves."" This movie is a hagiography...a worshipful or idealizing biography. Sir Richard picked his scenes well off the storyboard of Mahatma Gandhi's life. He tried to build up a life history treading two tracks..non-violence and India's freedom struggle. Otherwise, he left out many important facts that could be found given prominence in the man's autobiography. Plus, the short comings of the man were not dealt with.Sir Richard knew too well to leave out the minuses. I give him full marks for his deliberate attempt at hagiography. He is a master story teller...not a critic. Storytellers tell stories that catch your attention from ""once upon a time..."" to ""thus ends the tale"". He used his people well...he would want none less than Nana Palsikar (a revered Indian actor from the yester-years) to play a minuscule but moving role of an old farmer dying of hunger. He created a gripping short story out of the intense Om Puri and his little role. Sir Richard packed too many people into the movie without losing the grip, the story or the simplicity. So much that each time I watch the movie (23 times so far!), I find someone I know whom I had not seen on the movie before.There is one important tool to visual story-telling...editing. This movie is a text book on movie-editing. The one reason I watch it again and again is because of this. The editor (John Bloom) deserves the Oscar. He made the story simple and dramatic at the same time. Sir Richard used symbolism to the best to narrate the movie. He creates the impact at the beginning itself, with Bloom snipping the film at the right moments. Gandhi's assassination in 3 short scenes and the abrupt break to a massive funeral that starts off with the slow-steps of soldiers accompanying the mortal remains of Gandhi on his final journey. It's dramatic and raises your anticipation. Cut to South Africa...the train and you know, the story is unwinding to tell you why that man shot the old man. That is storytelling.How do you narrate the passing of time and with it the increased popularity of a man in a movie? The scene where Gandhi arrives at Champaran. The soldier tells the police officer...""He is coming!"" (Not exactly, but something similar). No name...no elaborate words to explain who is coming and what his story is. Just these few words and the movie positions Gandhi. Again...story telling.Another symbolism...the scene where Gandhi meets the Viceroy at the Viceregal House (now the Presidential Palace in India). Just one car with a motor cycle outrider that deposits its sole passenger who ascends the wide steps all alone, in a slow and poised gait, head slightly bowed. There is no one else save for two guards who stand to attention as the man in simple loin cloth and a wrap nears the final step. The scene lasts 20 seconds. It depicts the ascendancy of a simple man...yet another master piece from the movie. A scene with its own short story...Critics and analysts may go and watch something else. This is a movie for those who grew up reading stories and have not got over it. No wonder this movie has its immense following. It is a simple story of a man.PS: This one is for fellow Indians...want some comedy tips?...Watch out Sardar Patel's (Saeed Jaffrey) role carefully...he takes harmless but witty side-shots at Gandhi and his quotes...puts up naughty little faces too. Follow his eyes especially when Jinnah is around...looks of a cunning fox that measures up the lion against the tiger and takes sides accordingly. ""If I fast I die, if you fast, we will take all sorts of trouble to keep you alive"".Also Check out Nehru's role too...how the selfishness takes over...especially towards the end. In the scene after the riots Gandhi, Nehru and Patel are in conference. As Gandhi gets up to leave, Nehru utters ""Bapu, please where are you going?"" the tone sounds remonstrative. ""Why must I read news like this in the paper?"" he says (angrily) upon reading Gandhi's fast unto death. He waits for four days before he goes to Calcutta to meet the fasting Gandhi...why...to wait for his death??????",Gandhi
202,rkk,An OK movie about a very great man,8,26 November 1999,"This is a fairly enjoyable movie. It tries to cover a lot of ground, and even though it is long, it seems to rush through many events in a way that makes it seem strangely disjointed. The two strenghts of the movie are the fine acting by Ben Kingsley, and the fact that it introduces Gandhi to a wider audience than would be otherwise likely. However, if you are hoping to gain any insight into the real Gandhi then you will be disappointed. The movie also has some historical inaccuracies. The first (South Africa) section of the movie is more interesting than the latter portions. If you have the slightest interest in learning more about the Mahatma I urge you to read his autobiography ""The story of my experiments with truth"". There will then be little doubt that this movie is not, and can never be, a whitewash to make Gandhi appear in a better light than he really deserved. I give this an 8/10, mainly for it's entertainment value - as a biography it does not work.",Gandhi

May be the best drama film ever.. and if it's even half as documentary as it seem to be.. then we're witnessing the greatest mortal man ever to walk the earth..",Gandhi
204,mnaquvi,"Wrongly Taken as Accurate History, Many Real Characters Uunder-Rated and maligned",5,30 May 2016,"This is supposed to be a true biography of Gandhi and his times.From that point-of-view, it is filled with historical inaccuracies and the portrayal of certain characters is unrealistic and bordering on dishonest.BEN KINGSLEY's Gandhi is good for the screen but not accurate and realistic. Ben Kingsley's acting really deserved the awards and accolades he has received over time.Gandhi in real life wasn't all that is shown in the film. He has been overly glorified and many other characters has been maligned and under-rated against Gandhi's characters.Nehru was a much more handsome, articulate and impressive persona in his real life than Sethi's portrayal of Nehru.Jinnah has been much maligned. He was gaunt, good looking, tall and and immaculately dressed person in his real life. He would usually stun judges on the bench by his logical speech let alone an ordinary person. In the film he has been played by and ugly old man.This film should be seen as a film, just as a story to get the full enjoyment from it, not s an accurate record of actual history.Indian National Congress was started by an Englishman to create good relationship and communication between the ruling British and the subject Indians. It later grew up into a political instrument by which India got its freedom from the British. Many great Indians before Gandhi had worked in the organization to give it direction. JInnah joined the INC as one of the most successful lawyer of his time and a patriotic Indian in 1906. He worked alongside Hnidus, Parsis and Christians in the Congress working for freedom. Then Gandhi arrived from South Africa to India in 1915. He was welcomed in India as a Hero. IN the scene in the film, he is introduced to Jinnah as the leader of Muslim League.That is totally wrong. Jinnah was a part on the Congress at that time. Jinnah had full active support for the Congress because of the pluralistic Character of the party. There were no undertones of religious passions of any kind in the leadership neither in the workers.Gandhi introduced the call for RAM RAJ in the freedom movement, thus giving it a Hindu religious character to the movement. That alarmed the activists and workers belonging to other religions. Most notably, Jinnah was dismayed by this injection of religious passion in the political movement, which so far has been totally secular. He tried to counter it but was defeated by some more nationalist Hindu leaders joining in with Gandhi in the religious passion. Jinnah left the Congress totally annoyed by that. He went to England for a while.Jinnah was a secular parliamentarian in his political views. That is why he had avoided joining the Indian Muslim League at its inception in 1906.He left the INC in disgust when Gandhi came and injected Hindu religious nationalism in the party. He became the president of Muslim League only in 1916, when he had left the Congress and had seen with his own eyes that Congrees under Gandhi will not give any benefit to the Muslims in a free India.His work for a new Muslim Country, which created Pakistan, was an action of last resort to protect the political and social future of Indian Muslims.All indications after the 1945 end of the SEcond World War were that the British were a tired and exhausted rulers by that time, India was going to be freed anyway. To give all the credit of achieving freedom to one man, Gandhi, is inaccurate at best and really historical dishonesty.Watch and review the film just as another film, not any kind of accurate historical record, if you want to enjoy it.",Gandhi
205,anreddy9,Great film about the greatest person ever,9,9 April 2010,"I have given a rating of 9, as nothing can be 100% perfect (I might have rated a movie 10/10 in the past but experience, maturity n wisdom takes over eventually...esp after watching movies such as these). I believe people have already said a lot about what I had to say. Some breath taking scenes, perfect depiction of the principles of the great man on the celluloid, and a great performance from the cast n crew of the film. And each time, I seem to find something which I somehow seemed to miss in my earlier viewing. Amazing!Now, let me answer some of the comments some people have made.1. Gandhi never hated anyone, not even the Britishers. Remember he wanted to say ""goodbye"" to them ""as friends"" whenever they would leave, and not to take advantage of their WWII predicament. He admired the fairness in their judgment, except that he wanted to bring some changes in their law (as he says during his struggle in South Africa). 2. Gandhi an arrogant man: You should be a kinder-garden kid or you need strong doses of history :) Gandhi was quite the opposite. 3. He was not an opportunist. He was quite the opposite. He did not aspire for any political power, neither his kids benefit from him/his stature. Today, we don't even know where his descendants are. We all know where the Nehrus are (the current Gandhis, as you know, is a misnomer). 4. India being a land of violence: That's what he was fighting against. 5. Indians migrating to nations founded on British rule (i.e. US, UK, Canada, NZ, and Australia): That's not this movie about. Nevertheless, here's the answer. Migration is part of mankind, otherwise those counties listed above would never have been yours. At least, Indians did not conquer any countries, massacre the natives and take over their lands :) 6. This movie is feel good n boring movie: Yes, its almost impossible to find flaws in the great character. Boring? Well, you have not exactly graduated from James Bond movies to movies such as this.",Gandhi

The supporting cast was also very sensibly casted .No surprise that Steven Spielberg worked with them later in his movies. The story itself is a thriller from start to end.Gandhi taught the world the true power of the terms like ahimsa(peace) and satya(truth).he was rightly called as the ""Mahatma"".this was very aptly shown in this masterpiece.The British Empire was the embodiment of the word 'Power'; but it was surrounded by a sea of ideas it couldn't countenance or embrace, to its loss. How victorious can cannons and bullets be? Ironically, not victorious at all since ideas always precede force. Fortunately for Britain the average person understood this principle and the psychotics were moved out of the way. One day America will wake up too.",Gandhi
207,shafiqissani,what about Hitler,8,12 August 2012,"World War II had a profound effect on the colonial powers because it completely destroyed their economies. Although Hitler committed crimes against humanity, I give him credit—and not Gandhi—for India's independence immediately after World War II. Hitler destroyed the economies of Britain and France to such an extent that they were no longer able to financially maintain their military forces, and were hence incapable of containing the burgeoning freedom movements in their colonies. It is worth noting that Britain was in such bad shape that it received about one-fourth of the total aid given under the Marshall Plan. Regardless of Gandhi or any other charismatic leader, Britain would have left India in 1947 purely for financial reasons, due to its wholly collapsed economy. After WWII, Britain left not only India but nearly all its other holdings, including Jordan in 1946, Palestine in 1947, Sri Lanka in 1948, Myanmar in 1948, and Egypt in 1952. For the same reason, France also had to grant independence to Laos in 1949 and Cambodia in 1953, and had to leave Vietnam in 1954. Had there been no Hitler and no World War II, it most probably would have taken another 30 or more years for India and some of the other colonies to achieve independence.Another major consequence of World War II was that it greatly hastened Indian political independence. The highly publicized Cripps Mission that took place in India in 1942 was essentially a political ploy approved by Churchill to buy time for Britain and to try to assuage anti-colonialist feelings in the U.S. British historians P.J. Cain and A.G. Hopkins described the hopeless situation of the British in India as follows: By the end of war, there was a loss of purpose at the very center of the imperial system. The gentlemanly administrators who managed the Raj no longer had the heart to devise new moves against increasing odds, not least because after 1939 the majority of the Indian Civil Service were themselves Indian. In 1945 the new Viceroy, Wavell, commented on the ""weakness and weariness of the importance of the instrument still our disposal in the shape of the British element in the Indian Civil Service. The town had been lost to opponents of the Raj; the countryside had slipped beyond control. Widespread discontent in the army was followed in 1946 by a mutiny in the navy. It was then Wavell, the unfortunate messenger, reported to London that India had become ungovernable (which finally led to the independence of India). There is a saying that history is written by the victors of war. One of the greatest myths, first propagated by the Indian Congress Party in 1947 upon receiving the transfer of power from the British, and then by court historians, is that India received its independence as a result of Mahatma Gandhi's non-violence movement. This is one of the supreme inaccuracies of Indian history because had there been no Hitler and no World War II, Gandhi's movement would have slowly fizzled out because gaining full independence would have taken several more decades. By that time, Gandhi would have long been dead, and he would have gone down in history as simply one of several great Indian freedom fighters of the times, such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Motilal Nehru, Dada Bhai Naoroji, and C.R. Das. He would never have received the vast publicity that he did for his nonviolence movement. Political independence for India was achieved not by Mahatma Gandhi, but rather by Hitler rendering the British Empire a bankrupt entity.In fact, Gandhi's popularity among the masses had decreased substantially already in the 1930s, perhaps partially because in reality Gandhi had no idea of how to bring about India's independence. At the Madras Congress session in 1927, when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose, two other freedom movement leaders, succeeded in having a resolution passed declaring India's complete independence, Gandhi was annoyed, and hence—only to cater to Gandhi—the Madras resolution was modified to request dominion status under the British the following year at the Calcutta Congress Session in 1928.",Gandhi

211,kingboshra,Ghandi and Hinduism,10,22 April 2014,"Plot SummaryGandhi is a 1982 film that relates the biography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who is one of India's most profound non-violent, peaceful non-cooperating civil rights leaders. He was the leader behind the independence movement against the rule of India by the United Kingdom during the twentieth century. The film portrays the life of Mahatma Gandhi from when he was thrown off of a South African train for being in the whites' only seating area and closes up with his assassination and widely spread radio casted funeral. Within the film, Mahatma Gandhi is depicted as an individual who practiced Hinduism and who also accepted specific principles of Christianity and Islam. World ReligionThe film relates to World Religion, specifically Hinduism, mainly because of the fact that Mahatma Gandhi used methods of getting a message across through the use of Hindu principles. For example; he believed in peace and equality between all people which is rooted from a Hindu principle of tolerance. Since Hinduism is considered by Gandhi to be a faith that is all inclusive and stands for tolerance, he used this principle and made it his driving force for gaining the rights that were rightly deserved by his people. It is also known in Hinduism that mercy and graciousness is something that should never be abandoned. When Gandhi saw his people being oppressed by the British Empire by not being able to vote, being killed senselessly by the British generals and rations being placed upon them he realized that this was a violation of a Hindu principle of Mercy. These common issues occurring within India and the major oppression of his people made him fight passively for mercy to be restored for his people. Gandhi also stated in one of his autobiographies that the common factor of all religions is non-violence. We can see that he upheld to such a belief because he is widely renowned to be an individual who used passive methods to resolve any issues. Overall, we can see the connection between Gandhi's practices of passiveness and its relation to Hinduism. All of these examples show us how the film relates to World Religions.",Gandhi

The movie tried cover as much as possible in the limited hours. I presume there were problems from delineating history and picturing a man's life, but both of their lives are complexly intertwined, i don't know whether Gandhi would have been as he is if he had been in different country. I don't know Gandhi bequeathed non-violence from India or he taught to India. I don't know whether being black, short statured, feebly Gandhi was to take the course of non-violence or Gandhi used his own physical appearance to gain political advantage not to forget for the larger public. My problem is whether India made for her own sake or Gandhi made India as it is now. Leaving the questions aside, it is important to review which I have started seriously.Movie is really a treat to history lovers as well as to the movie lovers. The camera was efficiently used to transform a series of events into a single frame like when the tricolors were unfurled in the Redfort, Gandhi was shown spinning alone. The relation between the director and the lead actor should have been the best to translate the feelings into expressions, I think the movie is very close to the best. Background music brought the Indian sense, being a native I was able grasp it and thanks to good sound mixing. Screenplay should have been worked with much difficulty. Editor too should have fumbled a lot before pasting the cut rolls. Characterization and character selection was another area where Himalayan task would have been definitely felt, especially the looks of Patel!!! The dialogues were imperceptible whether they are real or were the works of the writer,particularly when C F Andrews and Gandhi met, hats off to the research team. I think there could be a possible bunch of history books in the making of movie itself! 23 years of work on it clearly reveals how people are really serious about the art of movie making.There were few historical errors like misplacement of Patel and Jinnah in certain occasions. There were some more with close of the movie like change of character of Gandhi during Quit India movement or the events which were missing.But these are difficult to avoid when you are on a monumental work.Thanks to the team and thanks to the leader.

Is this fair or cheating with the Mahatma and the nation on which this movie is filmed. I would like to remind the movie making team that the national language of India is Hindi, and the people of India do have the right to watch this movie in their national language, am I right? What is your though on this Sir Richard Attenborough? - When Mahatma Gandhi was shot, he remembered his Hindu deity God Ram and said 'He Ram' before dying. Only 'Oh God', the English translation of 'He Ram' was kept in light. I am not trying to favor a religion here but trying to be fair with Mahatma. The movie making team at least could keep the text 'He Ram' on the screen to keep the last words of Mahatma intact to convey the same to the audience as it is.

223,jp-moskowitz,"Wonderful Story, Bland Movie",5,11 July 2013,"A sweeping, cinematic, and bombastic take on the life and achievements of Mr. Gandhi. The film relies entirely on Hollywood clichés, simplifying the events of the period, the motives of those involved, and the moral and political complexities of this time period. This cartoonish version of Mr. Gandhi hobbles around India, spinning his wheel and always saying the exactly-correct thing at the exactly-correct time. None of the other characters seem to catch on to this eerie infallibility, however, and contradict him at every turn (or at least when it provides Gandhi with a chance to correct them). Gandhi's strained grandfather-humor, included as a blatant attempt to ""humanize"" him, gets old quick, and by the end, becomes an annoying self-parody. Then you have the issue of the doe-eyed women that surround him (Mrs. Gandhi, Mirabehn), who say very little the entire film. It seems as if their only real character trait is a total adoration for Mr. Gandhi. Moral tropes are used and re-used, and no complex moral questions are ever introduced. British bad. Indians good.Even worse, the film stands as an insult to all those besides Gandhi who worked tirelessly to make India free. No other leaders are ever mentioned - it's all Gandhi and his buffoonish politician friends, who only exist to stand at a foil to the clear wisdom of Gandhi. It all becomes a little ridiculous and repetitive after a while. It's sad, since the performance by Ben Kingsley is well-crafted. The script is simply not good.",Gandhi
224,siobhanmaria245,Accuracy of film,5,25 January 2012,"How Accurate was the Film ""Gandhi"" as a Portrayal of his Early Life?In the film ""Gandhi"" by David Attenborough, the story of Gandhi's life begins when he is around twenty, and whilst events shown from then are fairly accurate, Gandhi did have a colourful past before that which seems to have been omitted. In the book ""Indian Summer: The Secret History of the end of an Empire."" By Alex Von Tunzelmann, Gandhi's childhood and teens are described, highlighting the bad choices he made. These included: smoking, stealing from his family to fund this, almost committing suicide with his cousin and even visiting a brothel, though he didn't sleep with anyone there. After getting married at the age of thirteen, Gandhi also became obsessed with sex, having intercourse with his wife whilst pregnant, which is a sin against God. Strangely however, none of this seems to have been included in the film. It is literally completely skipped over and there is no mention of Gandhi's teens at all. These controversial issues being missed out suggests that Attenborough may have idolised Gandhi and so wanted to present him in a light that encouraged others to do the same. On the other hand, perhaps he thought that they might offend others who have faith in Gandhi, or they're not important to the story. Whatever the reason, it seriously damages the film's accuracy and creates a suspicion that the rest of the film will simply be without another mistakes Gandhi made. However this is not completely the case as we do see Gandhi grip his wife and shout at her. This is because she outright refuses to help clean their toilets. She call it the work of untouchables. Gandhi believed that everyone should do this as it was just as important a task as any. He quickly becomes furious, grabs her by the wrist and chucks her out, shouting. Followed by this is a quick realisation, regret and an apology from him. Whilst this seemingly squashes the notion that Attenborough is only showing Gandhi's good side, the book still presents him as much harsher. In the book, when he shouts at his wife, it is not because she is refusing to clean the toilets, but because she is crying as she is cleaning them. The outright refusal she gave in the film almost made it look as though Gandhi was justified in his reaction. Whilst in the book he looked irrational in his behaviour, as she was doing the task. This implies that perhaps Attenborough was trying to idolize Gandhi and that by showing a fault that wasn't too ad, the audience would be able to relate to him more. Therefore they would like him more, because everybody makes mistakes, and he apologised strait afterwards. Again though, this is Attenborough twisting the truth and again making the film inaccurate. In conclusion, the film ""Gandhi"" isn't a very accurate portrayal of the man's early life. The biggest mistakes of Gandhi's life are left out and this immediately creates a suspicion that the rest of the film will be just as inaccurate. Other mistakes are included, but tweaked to still make Gandhi seem the better person. This suggests that the purpose of the film is to make people idolize Gandhi rather than to provide a factual account of his life.",Gandhi

Obviously I had really no comprehension of the greatness of the man but I was aware of the name. I saw it once again at a much suitable age when I was about thirteen or fourteen and now fully encompassed with the knowledge of Gandhi from reading his biographies and going to his ashram in India. What I saw that day was something beyond anything I had experienced till that point. This was not a film I saw that day but something that I cannot describe in words. It was as if Richard Attenborough had gone back in time with a film camera and just shot the real Gandhi. Of course the credit for that completely goes to the brilliance of Ben Kingsley. Kingsley's performance is the greatest performance ever to be caught on film. I was not watching Kingsley but essentially I was viewing Gandhi. It was just shattering and jaw dropping what I had seen. Other than the acting, every other aspect of the film-making was just perfect. The great Ravi Shankar composed a score of breathtaking beauty and in complete harmony with the visual images of the great direction of Richard Attenborough. A perfect example of this is at the end of Gandhi with the ashes of Gandhi being spread across through the Ganges with Shankars score. I was just in awe and to this day I think it is the single greatest sequence in the history of film. I cannot sing enough praises for this film.

Because it is painted on a broad and beautiful canvas, the film is certainly visually stunning and stands out immediately from the huge mass. Especially the fact that the script was written around the words of Gandhi and the situations he became involved in from the beginnings in South Africa to the torture and massacre in India, makes the film special and unique. But the subsidiary characters are very poorly fleshed out. We see, for example, Gandhi's young sons near the start of the movie and yet we never meet them again, which seems kind of odd, because his wife plays a fairly major role in the film. Altogether this is an informative and enjoyable movie  watchings it is certainly an education  but it's not without its flaws, which while none of them are fatal, still leave one wondering how much better it could have been if the care and attention spent to Gandhi had been spread out over the whole production.",Gandhi

The choice of the music also served to create an atmosphere that could almost be grasped while watching the events unfold. I especially liked the way Ben Kingsley played the role of Mahatma Ghandi, showing not only his political ambitions and his ideals, but also conveying his more private side, his smiles and his relationship to his wife and people like Nehru.

This film is an accurate portrait of Gandhi and we are immersed in his story. It's not a simple documentary, we live it. According to me, it's so important to know and remember that it did happen : one man led his people to rise up without violence, one man led his people to accept punches and to protest peacefully and this man succeeded in changing the world forever.

Gandhi the movie, released in 1982 is the biopic about Mohandas Gandhi's life and his achievements for India, created by the brilliant British director, Richard Attenborough. The first thing we can say about this movie is that it's one of the greatest biopics ever. With a young and incredible Ben Kingsley, the Gandhi's life is perfectly restored, and the viewer has no trouble to get into this incredible, but true story. With a well-conducted technical quality and great acting from his actors, the film plays its full memorial part, and leads us into a well-paced story in which it is difficult to get out until the curtain falls. And it is here that lies the main problem of the film, which is an identity problem. So close from the pure movie, but also similar to a documentary film, the border between the two is blurred, and the spectator often wonder if he does not look a documentary film. With a soundtrack poorly managed, and too long film sequences, the viewer tends to get lost in this sometimes too great blend of historic and fantasy.

Mahatma Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance, called Satyagraha, is displayed in a very interesting and convincing way. I think this movie has already made a lot of people aware of Gandhi's good deeds not only for India. This man did not only free India but he also brought a lot of attention on how the British treated their colonies. The movie shows this in an entertaining way and is an important historical memory at the same time.Even 45 years after its release, the cinematography of ""Gandhi"" is still kind of breathtaking. From its countryside to big cities like Calcutta, Attenborough portrays many different aspects of India very well. He even used real Indian people for the many crowded scenes. Almost every scene in this movie has something spectacular to it. Attenborough won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction.Gandhi is played by Ben Kingsley, who was an unknown actor at that time. Kingsley did not only play him, he became Gandhi. Deservingly he won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best actor.All in all, I can only recommend watching ""Gandhi"" as it just is a wonderful movie with a great atmosphere. It is a film which describes the various characters very well and is also beautifully produced by Attenborough.

It is not possible to summarize the life of a so important man like Gandhi in just one three-hour movie but the producers did a good job. The movie begins with Gandhi's assassination and I really like this idea because you first get interested in how it came to this and you witness the assassination from the perspective of the murderer. Another very powerful scene is when Gandhi burns passes, what is against the law. He gets beaten over and over again, but he still continues. This action shows a very important character trait of Gandhi. He does not fight against the police, which describes Gandhi's way of protest very well. In addition to that the scene where Gandhis followers get beaten by the soldiers is very impressive because they accepted the beating and still stood to Gandhi and his morals. Gandhi had very close relation to his family, which is impressively shown when his wife died. I like it that Gandhi also is emotional and not arrogant. The most important facts about Gandhis life are well-performed but of course some things are made very simplistic because Gandhis life was full of important events.

245,hannahdeutermann,Is Gandhi responsible for India's early independence?,8,9 November 2017,"Gandhi. Was he really responsible for India's early independence or was he just a men like everyone else? Watching the movie ""Gandhi"", which was written by John Briley and produced and directed by Richard Attenborough in 1982, you will get a clear answer to this question. You will also get an inside view of Gandhi's whole life. His successes and his failures. You will see how he changed because of everything that happened to him, as well as India's and the world's reaction to him. This biographical drama won eight Academy Awards and was the most successful film in 1982, which was a big surprise as the film almost never got made. Attenborough tells Gandhi's story: The story of an Indian lawyer, who returned from South Africa to help his country gain its independence through successive acts of non-violent protest. This three-hour film probably tells one of the 20th century's most remarkable stories as Mahatma Gandhi created a new form of peaceful protests in India, which have been affecting history. The movie starts with Gandhi's assassination and then goes 30 years back in time to show his key moments in his struggle of creating a peaceful India. Gandhi, however, is the kind of man, who would do anything to achieve his goal, even if this means to go to prison a couple times or nearly starving to death. It took him 30 years to accomplish what he wanted and I think this shows that everyone is able to achieve his goal with a little patience even if it seems impossible. Even though the actor Ben Kingsley won the Academy Award of Best Actor for his stunning role, one of the eight Academy Awards this film won, there are really good performances from other actors as well like Candice Bergen, John Gielgud, Edward Fox and many more. Even if the film did not win the Academy Award for best original music score, for which this film was nominated, the music is still stunning and creates a different feeling for every situation. Attenborough, who really wanted to create this movie, created an awesome drama, which helps to understand Gandhi's point of view, even if it does not have a happy ending.",Gandhi
246,julekortemeier,Great movie,8,11 November 2017,"''There may be tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they may seem invincible, but in the end, they always fail.'' - Mohandas Gandhi This quote from the movie 'Gandhi', which was published in 1982, and produced and directed by Richard Attenborough, who also worked on various different movie genres and didn't only concentrate on historical movies or biographies, shows Gandhis' view of riots and violence in India. The film tells the story of Mohandas Gandhi, an Indian citizen fighting for equality and independence. Many people showed great interest in his life, which led to 8 Oscar-Acadamy-Awards and great success. The movie starts with a scene, in which Gandhi is assassinated and continues with his funeral in 1948. Then, there is a time leap to 1893, where Gandhi gets thrown off of a train in South Africa, because he isn't white. Because of that and other aspects of discrimination, he starts his first protest, in which he already follows his concept of satyagraha, a peaceful way of protest. The movie goes on and more and more people follow him and participate in his protests, making them more powerful. After a while, almost every Indian knows, who Mohandas Gandhi is, making his hunger fast a powerful weapon against war and riots. The film shows his influence on the people and on India generally and how he affected India's history and possibly prevented the death of many people. The actor, which plays Gandhi, Ben Kingsley, is very convincing. He transfers Gandhi's calmness and wiseness, but also his word power and influence on other Indians. It is shown that Gandhi would have willingly died at a protest or at a hunger strike, if it had helped to create peace in India. He thought of India as a union between Muslims, Hindus and all other religious groups, which was also why he was against partitioning India. His view on the problem seemed to be the right view, as mass violence and riots were only a few effects of Partition. The movie, which was filmed in India, preserves a great insight into the true life of an Indian at that time. It shows the discrimination, starting in the second scene, in which Gandhi is thrown off of the train, because he refused to leave the first class, which was only for white people. In another scene it is shown that Indians weren't allowed to walk on the side walk, since again, only white people were allowed to walk on there. In almost every scene it gets clear that the British were clearly privileged and the Indians were less worth as much than the British. Altogether, I would recommend watching the movie, since it isn't only historically informative but also allows an inside look into the life of Indians at the time of Partition. It shows that almost every Indian was invested into the war and the riots and that there was barely a way to avoid it. In my opinion, it also illustrates the big impact of Mohandas Gandhi and that the war wouldn't have passed as peaceful as it did with him.",Gandhi
247,kromerlaura,Beautiful storytelling,8,12 November 2017,"The 1982 film ""Gandhi"", written by John Briley and produced by Richard Attenborough, tells the story of Mahatma Gandhi's life.At the beginning of the film we witness Gandhi's assassination from the perspective of the assassinator. I really liked that scene because the viewers get to see the assassination through his eyes, including Gandhi being shot. However, the scene wasn't fully shot from the assassinator's perspective. The viewers also get to see his face in a close up and someone who appears to be his accomplice. To me this scene has some kind of deeper meaning, especially when taking into consideration how the movie ends but I will get to that later on. Another thing I like about this opening scene is that the assassinator and his accomplice appear a few times throughout the movie. I think that's a nice detail and to me it seems like a metaphor, showing both, Gandhi's followers and opponents in the same scene without them actively having a conflict.The movie then goes back to 1839 when Gandhi, being a middle aged father and lawyer, gets confronted with the unfairness of society in South Africa. He is thrown off of a train because he sits in a train compartment which he isn't allowed to sit in. I liked that scene because it gives the viewers a first impression on Gandhi's personality in comparison to the construct of society at that time.After that the movie is filled with many powerful scenes showing the peaceful protest against the violence of the British police, as well as the violent conflicts between Hindus and Muslims. Another thing that I liked about the movie is the development of Gandhi and his growing audience. While at the beginning of the film we see Gandhi in a suit talking to a handful of people, at the end we see him in his simple white clothes followed by an uncountable amount of people. In addition to that, I think the scenes of his fasts and his time in prison are really impressive, not only because of the way Gandhi handled the situation but also the people around were really emotional. There's one part of the movie which I think is really precious and adds some nice details to it. By that I mean Gandhi's relationship to his wife. I absolutely adore the way the movie shows that Gandhi is still just human like everybody else, even though he did such impressive things. It is shown that he cares for his wife and stays by her side all the time, though he had some inner conflicts about that at the beginning of the movie. Their love seems so pure and honest which to me is a balance to the way Gandhi is presented throughout the rest of the film. Especially when she dies the movie seems to only focus on that for a few minutes. This is also the only scene when Gandhi cries. He smiles a lot throughout the movie even in the most difficult situations but in that scene he is shown as a man losing his wife and nothing more than just that. This is why this is one of my favourite scenes in the film. However, there are some scenes in the movie that bother me. One thing I didn't like about the movie is that there are some scenes where the characters would just a have talk for a while which made me lose interest in the movie a few times because the characters seemed to repeat themselves a lot instead of having short, impressive scenes which the viewers actually keep in mind. Another thing I don't particularly like is that sometimes the movie seems to show Gandhi as some kind of god. It is in fact true that many people saw him as a hero but sometimes it was simply too much of praise because it wasn't necessary for the viewers to see that over and over again.At the end of the movie we get to see the assassination scene again but this time from the perspective of Gandhi. Like I said before I think that scene is really impressive especially when comparing the beginning and the ending of the film. It is basically the same scene but we get to look through Gandhi's eyes. It is slightly different to the first scene because we get so see the last steps Gandhi takes as well as the last thing he sees and his last words, when at the beginning of the movie we see the way the assassinator takes and his perspective on it which is why at the end, instead of showing Gandhi's death again, the screen turns black and we hear his last words. I really like how the movie presents those two perspectives because it shows both, the part that loved Gandhi and the part that wanted to see him dead. All in all, I can say that I enjoyed the movie not just because of the story showing Gandhi's life but especially because of the little details which really turned the movie into this impressive piece of art. I would absolutely recommend that movie to anybody who wants to see the historical facts about Gandhi within a biographical drama movie.",Gandhi

Starring Ben Kingsley, Candice Bergen, Edward Fox and many other great actors, it was interesting to watch it.The intention of the movie was to show the viewer the life of Mohandas Gandhi (Mahatma Ghandi). The movie did that perfectly. It showed some very important things in detail such as the salt march or Gandhi's conflict with the Britsh government and also that he is was very peaceful type of person.Ben Kingsley, an Indian-Britsh actor, played the role of Gandhi. He performed the role perfectly because he almost exactly looked like Gandhi and he played it as if he was Gandhi himself. I also liked that the film did not set something like a no go. It showed nearly everything, including the worse things like a brutal massacre.Personally I recommend to watch the movie. Everyone should see a movie about one of the greatest persons that has ever lived. I would rate it 9 stars out of 10.",Gandhi
249,abendlichtx,Impressive biography of one of the most important humans in the history of India,7,12 November 2017,"A movie about a thin man wrapped in a white sheet and therefore dressed like one of the poor in India. Who would be interested in that? But with eleven nominations and eight Academy awards it is clear that the biography of this man is not that uninteresting. Actually, it is the story of the most important man in the history of not only India and its fight for independence but also for the whole world. Richard Attenborough's Gandhi, starring Ben Kingsley, was published in 1982, 34 years after the actual assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. This is also the opening scene of the movie, followed by the statement that he was even more powerful than empires. Right from the beginning it is clear which effects Gandhi had on his environment. It goes on with the young Gandhi, who is a lawyer being discriminated in South Africa, causing him to protest against the injustices that are caused by the British and after that him being imprisoned. The first of several more times. Again free and back in India, he begins to travel the country together with his wife to ""see what needs to be told"". He also begins to dress like the poor and, after seeing the bad circumstances in his country caused by the British Raj, he starts to bring people to question things and starts to fight for India's independence. He calls up for a peaceful non-violent noncooperation but the riots get out of control. Gandhi begins a hunger strike to stop them, which actually works out, but still, he gets arrested again, this time for six years. India's independence has nearly arrived as he is allowed to leave. As a last peaceful protest he organizes the Salt March against British salt taxes. He is still underestimated by the British Raj, but as thousands follow his example, it comes to mass arrests. Then, throughout the Second World War, the British are wounded and can no longer hold onto the government of India. Gandhi uses this weakness to request the release of all his imprisoned followers and India's independence. The conclusion of that is on the one hand the independence of India but on the other hand the partition of India into a Hindu India and a Muslim Pakistan (even though he is strictly against this), which causes a brutal civil war. Again, Gandhi starts a hunger strike so that the fighting stops and both sides promise to ""die when they lay their hands on each other"". Gandhi then plans to go to Pakistan but even after everything he did, there is still a sadness about him that he thinks of having failed. He then makes his way up to a prayer, followed by crowds of people, where the movie ends where it has begun: his assassination. All in all, the biography is really impressive. It does not only show his life and the very key moments of it, but also gives a view into his way of thinking. Throughout the whole movie it gets clear how important nonviolence is to him and how he achieves enormous things by this different, peaceful and unique kind of protest. It also shows how critical he was with himself and how he wanted his environment and the people from all over the world to accept and love each other. The actors are also well chosen so that Gandhi could be shown in a timespan of 50 years of his life and how he grew with his actions and words. The only critic is that 188 minutes is a really long time for a movie, but otherwise there is so much to tell about this thin man wrapped in a white sheet and his life story, that probably another three hours could be easily added.",Gandhi
250,fionatiek,"Review of the film ""Gandhi"" from 1982",8,12 November 2017,"The biographical drama ""Gandhi"" was written by John Briley and directed by Richard Attenborough. It was released in 1982 and received 8 Academy Awards and Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Foreign Film in the following year. Richard Attenborough had attempted to get the project made for 18 years which demonstrates how much determination and passion were spent during the making of the film. Ben Kingsley, a British actor who, portrays Mohandas Gandhi in the film also received an Academy Award for Best Actor. The 74 year old is also well known for his performances in the films Schindler's List (1993), Shutter Island (2010), Iron Man 3 (2013) and many more. The film is about Mohandas Karamchad Gandhi's life as the leader of the Indian non-violent independence movement against the British rule in the 20th century. It begins with Gandhi's assassination on 30th January 1948, when he was shot three times by a Hindu fanatic named Nathuram Godse (Harsh Nayyar). The film goes on with a defining moment in Gandhi's life, when he is thrown off a train to Pretoria, South Africa in 1893 because of racial injustice. This particular moment convinces Gandhi to fight for equal rights for Indians first in South Africa, later in India.The film also shows Gandhi's salt march and other projects. The actors in the film were appropriately cast, because the film's production was a British-Indian cooperation and there are British and Indian actors. Ben Kingsley was a good choice as the protagonist because of his Indian heritage and great acting skills. Most of the acting is well done, especially Ben Kingsley let everyone truly imagine what the real Mohandas Gandhi was like. The viewer can see what life was like in India in the 20th century and what Gandhi, his family and his huge community was like. Ben Kingsley plays Gandhi very convincingly throughout the whole movie. The use of camera is very good because it was filmed from different angles. These angles are switching a lot to illustrate the different point of views, for example almost at the end of the movie, when Gandhi is really weak from his fast and everyone is standing around his bed, we can see all the visitors from Gandhi's perspective. This technical element creates a very diversified perspective which in my opinion is well done. The lighting contributes, like the sound to the setting and atmosphere of the film and increases the intended effect of the film. This can be seen during the different phases of Gandhi's life. At the beginning of the film, when there are only a few followers of his independence movement, these followers shout approvingly but hesitantly at him during his speeches. Later, the crowds get bigger and bigger and the people begin to shout ""Long life Gandhi-j!"". In contrast to these scenes, Gandhi's growing unpopularity can be seen rather at the end of the film when the crowd screams ""Death to Gandhi!"". I think this use of sound and also of special effects is rather interesting because it demonstrates how the masses saw Gandhi throughout his life. At the end of the film, which shows Gandhi's death from a different perspective, it can be seen how Hindu fanatics are willing to kill Gandhi because they think he is too friendly with Muslims and Christians. All in all, I think ""Gandhi"" is a good film because it lets the viewer get a look inside Gandhi's life and it shows his whole personality including his fears and dreams for himself, but more importantly for India. In my opinion, his family especially his children could have appeared more frequently because they are a part of his life, even though they don't seem to play a big role. Their relationship could have been touched a bit more, since it would have been interesting to see him as a father. Of course, he is or appears to be the father of India and especially India's independence but in this film it seems like he is almost a stranger to his own children. Even if that is true, this relationship would have been a significant and very interesting addition to the film which I would have really liked to see. Despite these critical remarks, I consider the film a successful one and recommend watching the film because the viewer gets an idea of Gandhi's lifestyle and personality, including his fight for equality, his philosophy of non-violent protest and his wish to see the world at peace.",Gandhi
251,bosiclidija,"Do you think ""Gandhi"" is a boring movie ? Personally, I think it is not.",9,13 November 2017,"GANDHI REVIEWThe movie is a very important part of India's development which shows a realistic hero. Gandhi is a 1982 British-Indian epic biographical drama. It was produced and directed by Richard Attenborough and written by John Briley and it is about one of the biggest personalities of the 20th century. He is called Mohandas Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi), the leader of India's non- violent, non-cooperative independence movement against the United Kingdom's rule of the country during this century.Richard Samuel Attenborough was an English actor entrepreneur and politician. He attended the British Academy of Dramatic Art and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. As a film director and producer Attenborough won two Academy Awards for Gandhi in 1983. In this case Gandhi is the eighth-highest Oscar winning film of all time claiming eight awards from 11 nominations, including best film. The late director Richard Attenborough took 20 years to collect all the money for the movie. He was convinced that the movie would be telling one of the 20th- century's most remarkable stories that of the Indian lawyer who returned from racially segregated South Africa to drive the British out of his home country through successive acts of non-violent protests.Ben Kingsley played Gandhi and is therefore the main character in the movie. He was the perfect option because he was a young man who portrayed Gandhi very well. Gandhi was a friendly person who helped everyone and fought for justice. The movie was filmed in Delhi, India and England, UK. The shooting began on 26th November, 1980 in India and lasted up until 10th May, 1981. It cost estimated 22.000.000 Dollars. For the scene where Gandhi died roughly 300.000 people were obliged, just 200.00 of it volunteers. The rest, about 94,600 people, received a small fee. Eleven camera teams were necessary to turn the admissions to this one scene. Summarized I can say that Gandhi is a didactic movie which shows Gandhi's point of view and that everyone can fight with non-violence for their rights and can reach something in their lives.",Gandhi
252,michaelscheer-66014,Gandhi the Movie,10,18 November 2017,"Do you believe in heroes? Heroes to look up to? Because I recently watched a movie which is about a real life hero. The movie is called ''Gandhi''. It was released in 1982 by Richard Attenborough. The movie is about the life of the famous Indian independence fighter Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi or as you may know him ''Mahatma Gandhi''. The movie got nominated for 11 Academy Awards in 1983 and won 8 of them. One of them was won in the category of ''Best Movie''. The movie is a historical drama. The movie starts with the assassination of Gandhi in 1948. It then flashbacks onto his life and the effects he achieved. Gandhi is one of India's most famous persons ever to be alive. He fought, in a peaceful way, for India's Independence. Gandhi's way of living and dealing with problems was unique. He left his mark on people like Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela. Although the movie is about three hours long, it is full of scenes which catch the viewers' emotions by surprise. Overall this is a great movie because it describes the life of Gandhi pretty well for three hours. The movie keeps the viewers' attention at all times. I would give it a rating of 10/10.",Gandhi
253,alkasoni,Gripping account and great movie about a great man. Well researched and quite authentic. A must watch! I found only one technical weak (minor) spot in the film.,10,3 January 2006,"I found Gandhi to be quite an exciting film. The 3 hour long film has a very good pace and i was quite absorbed by it. I saw it on BBC which means no commercial breaks and i was really hard-pressed for a toilet break as i didn't want to miss anything. :) TECHNICALLY i couldn't fault with the film apart from one thing in one of the very early Scenes... ****Minor Spoiler*** Skip this para! ....where people are walking to greet the Mahatma. You can see the eyes of a few in the crowd stray to the camera to the right. But this was really the only thing. The rest of the film is superb.HISTORICAL ACCURACY. It is a challenge always, to have to decide which things to include and which not. Sometimes events of symbolic value hold not much cinematic impact and there we must grant the director some Laissez-faire. Considering all that - the film in my opinion and knowledge of history tries to be true and depicts very well the transformation of a man from a shy lawyer to a ""radical"". There are some people and events that are not represented fully or altogether missed out - but then its only 3 hours we have here.I think this film will appeal to people who have interest in the events that shaped the 20th century world, and to whom a pop-star is not all the celebrity they need. Here is a man who is unique not because he helped India break free of the shackles of colonialism or that he helped the downtrodden or that he was loved by millions, but because he held Truth to be the highest ideal and showed the world that non-violence is much more powerful than anything else. (Pay heed Mr.Bush and you religious war-mongers). Gandhi was of a privileged family, studied in England and lived abroad for more than 24 years and yet gave it all up. He had it in his heart to really understand the suffering and plight of humanity. Buddha and Mahavira did it 2000 years ago and then Gandhi. Gandhi is simply the most amazing person! I think Albert Einstein said the following at the time of Gandhis death ""Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.""",Gandhi
254,krugermaggie,Gandi,10,14 February 2006,"This film taught me so much about Gandhi's life. I barely knew what he was so famous for, i had really only heard the name. He is now one of the most influential people i have ever read about or seen a film on. His life was absolutely amazing and i'm sad he couldn't go on living forever. His beliefs, in that period of time, were looked down upon. He surprised the British Empire so many times and deserves every credit he was ever given. This is a great story of an amazing man. I believe that it was help you more fully understand his life, accomplishments, and beliefs. It has some graphic features, so if you choose to show it to children, use caution. Nonetheless, it is one of the best films of history you'll be able to get your hands on. If you get the chance, definitely check this movie out.",Gandhi
255,sskr,Gandhi's LAST WORDS---' HEY RAAM',10,6 January 2006,"Having watched this exceptionally perfect masterpiece many many times, I have remained slightly disappointed with Sir Richard Attenborough's choice in Gandhiji's last words of 'oh god' before his death. Nodoubt, Sir Richard relied on ''translation'' of The Mahatma's last words but perhaps needed to dig deeper. Mahatma Gandhi was a devotee of 'Rama' --one of the incarnations of the Supreme Cosmic power. Rama --better pronounced as Raam--taught the world patience, love, tolerance, virtue, duty, sacrifice, care..... Mahatma Gandhi had adopted these principals in his life and read the Hindu scriptures , mainly 'THE GEETA' regularly. His last words---as everyone in India knows--- were 'HEY RAAM'. Such term/words give connotation of reverence to the Lord rather than the 'casual' note of 'oh god'. Yes, Mahatma Gandhi had deep faith in Jesus too, read the Bible and his favourite hymn was '' LEAD KINDLY LIGHT AMIDST THE ENCIRCLING GLOOM, LEAD THOU ME ON. THE NIGHT IS DARK AND I AM FAR FROM HOME--LEAD THOU ME ON'. Jesus, RAMA (RAAM), KRISHNA...TO A TRUE HINDU, ARE ALL INCARNATIONS ('UVTARS')OF THE CREATOR who is beyond the man-made factions of divinity-----which created us all.",Gandhi
256,kannmanbrauchen,"3 hours 11 minute watched, every second was worth it",10,18 December 2018,"What comes to your mind first when you think about Indians? Probably that Indians invented Curry and that their cows are holy.
But do you know about Gandhi and Indian History? The movie ""Gandhi"" gives a very good insight into the life of Mahatma Gandhi and India.""Gandhi"" was directed and produced by Richard Attenborough in 1982. The action takes place in India and begins with a scene which shows Gandhi´s assassination. After his death his funreal is shown, where a lot of people took part in.
Then, there is a lapse in time to Gandhi´s youth. In South Africa Gandhi belong to the Indian Congress Party, due to his actions the viewer gets a first impression about his character.
His philosophy that everyone is equal, no matter which religion or country they belong to, is presented during his time in the Indian Congress Party of South Africa.
He gives a speech in front of a lot of people where he shares his philosophy of non-violent protest. In my opinion the movie very well shows how Gandhi developed his philosophy of protest and bringing people together.
Due to his first non-violent protest in South Africa British arrest him shortly after, he is released and goes back to India by ship, where he is welcomed very heartly. It shows that Indians respect him and agree with his philosophy.
In India Gandhi is sentenced to prison again but the director of the prison releases him. I must admit: I did not understand why he was imprisoned and why he was released again.
After that he introduced a new strategy of protest: the Indians should not use any means of transport that was controlled by the British. His strategy worked but he was arrested again and he had to stop, as some Indians were killed by the British.
While Gandhi was imprisoned, the British attacked a meeting of Indians and killed them. The Indians could not do anything and just ran around. A few days later the leader of the British army was interrogated and Gandhi visited the place where all those Indians were killed and was shocked. In my opinion they should have shown why Gandhi was released from prison again and how this led to the next scene.
In the next scene British, Indians and Gandhi gather to talk about the future of the British Raj. In this meeting Gandhi says that British will walk out of India. To my mind, this sentence shows Gandhi´s self-confidence.
However, some days later Indians go through the streets of a city with bearing torches and burned a British house and kill the British. After this, Gandhi thinks about quitting his role as a leader but the people around him convinc him not to do that. It can be said that Gandhi had hard time fighting for the independence of India.
Gandhi was sentenced to six years prison. As soon as he was released he did the ""Salt March"", which many Indians took part in and although many Indians got hit with sticks and some were arrested, the Indians were not violent.
This led to an invitation of Gandhi by the Viceroy, where they talked about the indenpendece of India.
In August 1947, the mounth of partition, India was divided into India and Pakistan. Along the border people were walking around and suddenly they started to fight.In conclusion, I can say that the movie gives a detailed insight to the life of Gandhi and partition of India. However, I´m missing some details like why and how Gandhi got released from prison. All in all, it is a very good movie and shows Gandhi´s philosphy perfectly.",Gandhi
257,nina-wehmeyer,"""Gandhi"" : highly praised and received many awards",9,6 January 2019,"""Gandhi"" is an informative and realistically played film. The 1982 historical drama is based on the life of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and won many awards, for example the Oscar for the Best Film in 1983. It was written by John Briley and produced and directed by Richard Attenborough.The film shows Gandhi over the years and the problems he faces while he fights for the independence of India. However, he tries to follow his principles and therefore continues his non-violent protest. In my opinion, Ben Kingsley portrays the protagonist really well. This is because he shows emotions which seem very realistic. Especially the scene when Gandhi´s wife dies comes to my mind. The character sheds a tear and his eyes reflect all the misery he is feeling at that moment. In addition, when Gandhi is in Amritsar and looks at the place at which many Indians lost their lives, you can clearly see his shocked expression. The character Gandhi also gives many speeches and the actor makes it look really convincing that it creates the impression that this is the real Gandhi and that he actually supports these words. His fragile look and also his calming presence give a realistic picture of what the real Gandhi was like. I was also impressed by the impersonation of many other side characters, such as General Dyer, played by Edward Fox. General Dyer is represented ruthlessly and even keeps a serious face while giving the command in Amritsar to shoot down the Indians during their non-violent protest. He doesn´t look as if he is regretting anything; it is a perfect example which shows that the British had no mercy during their rule over India. In memory of this massacre, there is also a two-minute break with a black screen and the sound of a sitar. It creates a depressing atmosphere and shows that the action, that takes place in the film, really happened and also underlines the traumatic situation at that time. The film tries to focus more on the historical facts and to have a natural image than to create a fictional movie with many effects. It accompanies Gandhi´s life and shows many of his experiences. The music is also chosen very well. Most of the time it is really dramatic and perfectly emphasizes the tragic situations like violent scenes. There are even scenes in which you can see the landscape of India and also Indian music is played. This gives you a picture of the surroundings and creates an indigenous atmosphere. So the film really follows the intention to introduce the watchers to Gandhi´s life.All in all, I like the film because it is well played and really thought-out. It represents a realistic picture of the characters, so it is perfect for people who are really interested in the topic and who want to get an own idea of Gandhi and what he did. However, I wouldn´t recommend it to people who expect a feature film which is full of action because ""Gandhi"" has a different intention.",Gandhi
258,timkil,"Gandhi, the peace himself",9,29 December 2018,"To win a war against a superior force, you don't necessarily need weapons. That's exactly the method Mohandas K. ""Mahatma"" Gandhi and his followers employed to evict the British Empire from their homeland, India. The film ""Gandhi"" tells the life of this great man who is also called the father of India. As he fought for independence and equal rights, he was one of the most influential people of his time.""Oh God"" - This were Gandhi's last words when he was shot by a Hindu fanatic in 1948. His assassination is the beginning of the film and shows realistically how his followers were mourning his death. After this introduction, the film jumps to Gandhi's youth showing him at the beginning of his rise, in South Africa in 1893. Although the film is quite old, it is capable of showing Gandhi's message clearly to the viewers. This makes the film even more special because nowadays most films don't possess a message from which the viewers can learn. Another point I very much liked about ""Gandhi"" is that it has the ability to directly amidst the viewer into the events, which surprised me a lot because I would never have expected this from such an old film. This film also shows that you needn't employ a huge amount of special effects to create an impressing film. Another huge factor which makes this film remarkable is the magnificent performance of Sir Ben Kingsley as Gandhi. The 190 minutes running time display many scenes which shaped Gandhi's development being the saviour of the Indians, but also the suffering which his non-violent protests caused, e.g. his multiple imprisonments or the sacrifices of many Indians. Because ""Gandhi"" is very informative in each of its scenes, I can claim that I can give a detailed account of his life due to this masterpiece. Of course, the film contains some disturbing aspects: the sound quality is bad although this is normal for a film at this time; some scenes have literally no content at the first sight, like for example shots of the landscape or a black screen with only music in the background and could bore or confuse the viewers.Nevertheless, I would say that this film is very well executed for a film at this time and it manages to perfectly show the life of Mahatma Gandhi and his remarkable philosophy of satyagraha (His non-violent way of protesting and redressing wrongs). Therefore I really recommend this film to everyone who wants to know something about Gandhi or is interested in history. I give this film 9 out of 10 stars!",Gandhi
259,veronikahaak,Awesome Movie,8,6 January 2019,"""In this cause, I, too, am prepared to die. But, my friends, there is no cause for which I am prepared to kill."" - GandhiStrong words from a human, who has changed thousands of minds and lives. A human who was not only called the father of the Indian Nation, a human who was a role model and a big inspiration for many historical personalities like Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King. A strong human who was worth it making a movie about. Finally the director and producer Richard Attenborough made Gandhi.
The movie basically tells the life of Mahatma Gandhi, who was the leader of the Indian independence movement against the British rule. It deals with his early years as a lawyer in South Africa in 1893 till his death on 30th of January, 1948 in India. The plot starts with Gandhi´s assassination which is unusual in movies because movies do not usually start with their ending: After an evening prayer on 30th of January in 1948, Gandhi is out for a walk to meet a large number of greeters and admirers.One of them, a fanatic Hindu, shoots him three times in the chest. Gandhi´s last words before falls dead are ""Oh God!""
Gandhi is played by Ben Kingsley, who he plays fantastically. They really look alike and the way he acts is amazing. In 1983 he won an Oscar for ""Best actor"" for his performance. He plays his role convincedly. So do the actors of the British representatives.
The movie runs over 3 hours and at some point I got bored, in particular during the scene when the background was completely black and you could just hear for music for 5 minutes. But the meaning of it has a great impact of the film. It gives a feeling of tensions. When it got back to politics, I was amazed. One of the best and one of the saddest scene was the massacre of Amritsar, where the British shot at Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs because they protested and fought for their independence. In this scene you could really feel the pain and the anxiety of the people. The British did not care about children or women, they shot at everyone. The Indians tried to flee but doors and gates were closed so there was no chance to escape. In general I liked all the scenes in which Gandhi fought for India´s independence in a peaceful and calm way. Gandhi was known for his non-violent protests. He proved that one does not need violence to fight for something. He opened the eyes of thousands of people, who followed him and appreciated him. In the funeral scene you could really feel how much the people loved him. It was amazing to see this.
The soundtrack is great, most of the time it is typical Indian music. What really amazed me was the quality of the movie. The movie is from 1982 but the quality is fantastic. Gandhi is an epic historical drama film, which introduces Gandhi´s whole life. The movie shows that solidarity and non-violence are the only ways to win. The fact that this movie was nominated for 11 Oscars and won 8 of them, shows how good the movie is.
Attenborough made a film which could not have a bloodshed of the Hindu and Muslim population of liberated India is addressed, as is the partition into India and Pakistan. You can almost hear Gandhi's heart breaking.
All in all, Attenborough did a great job and I would definitely recommend this movie if you are really want to get to know something about Gandhi´s life, it is really worth it. This movie is for everyone. If i could rate it i would give this movie 8/10 points.""I want to change their minds, not kill them for weaknesses we all possess.""

260,julerieke,"Small human, BIG LIFE.",7,6 January 2019,"Richard Attenborough's historical movie Gandhi is his undisputed masterpiece.
The actor of Mahatma Gandhi, Ben Kingsley, takes you with him through an incredible life which nobody has ever experienced like this before: from an ordinary lawyer to one of the biggest leaders of all time.
In the movie there are a few action scenes but the focus is definitely on the dialogues and speeches, which drag it just a little bit out sometimes. When you watch how Gandhi´s nonviolent protest is demonstrated, you gain nothing but respect for such a frail looking man, who cannot be pulled down. Also, the movie doesn´t glorify the British Empire because it is very critical and realistic at the same time. That´s a reason why the contrast between the Indians and Britons couldn´t be bigger in some parts. For example the minority of typical British Ladies and Gentlemen who amble through the streets in their expensive clothes next to the majority of poor Indians and their children who already struggle with living at least a normal life. BUT it also shows how ruthless and brutal both groups fought each other and among themselves. As a 2000s kid who luckily didn´t grow up with war or violence next door, a few scenes seem to be unbelievable: people who almost randomly kill other people. It is inconceivably nowadays.
Definitely a must-watch for everybody who wants to learn more about Mahatma Gandhi and Indian history. But I would recommend to watch it in more than one part or just not in the late evening because 3 hours can sometimes be pretty long....",Gandhi
261,moix-66044,I haven't thought Ghandi would be so amazing°,8,7 January 2019,"I recently watched the ''Gandhi'' movie in English class.A little men that gets beaten up several times, not fighting physically back, is becoming one of the most influential -if not- the most influential person in Indian history: Mahatma Gandhi.The movie describes the life of the so-called Mahatma; from his rise and fall.
The movie immediately opens with Gandhi's death, followed by a scene where thousands if not millions of Indians cry over him and celebrate his funeral. This creates a really curious impact in the viewers mind, leading to ask yourself, who this old man was, what did he do that he is so much loved and why he got killed?After that, the movie starts to tell the beginning of Gandhi and jumps back in time in 1893, South Africa. Here Gandhi, a young lawyer, faced racism for the first time, gets beaten up by several policeman, is arrested, but in the end fights back in a non-violent way by using his knowledge as a lawyer and eventually gets free and saves the rights of the Indian people in South Africa.
This event spreads through the whole British Empire leading to Gandhi's fame, especially in India.
By the time Gandhi arrived in India, he gets greeted by thousands of people and is asked to help the country to free itself from the Empire. At first he refuses, but after an incident where the British soldiers got violent against Indian people, he realizes that they treat them like second class citizens and starts to fight back.
Of course in a non-violent way.Personally, I didn't thought, the movie would be that brutal, and exciting.
The Image of Gandhi, as a non-violent, peacefully person, let me think that the movie would be really boring; but this is not the case!
I was actually shocked by the brutality Gandhi and the Indian people experienced, which created a lot of tension in the movie.
The tension was sometimes so high, that I blurred everything out and felt to be ''inside'' of the Movie.
But of course the movie has some weak bones:
Sometimes I felt a bit bored, especially in the several prison scenes.
Another thing I have to criticize is the shaky camera movement. It made the movie sometimes uncomfortable to watch.
This could have been improved, especially when you compare it to some silent movies which came decades before.To put it in a nutshell, I think the ''Gandhi'' movie represents Gandhi as a person.
It got interesting dialog such as an interesting and exciting story, but because of the flaws I pointed out, I only give the movie a 8/10 stars rating.",Gandhi
