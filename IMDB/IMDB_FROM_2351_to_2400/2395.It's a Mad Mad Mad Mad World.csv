0,MartinHafer,It holds up well....,8,10 April 2017,"I just had rotator cuff surgery and this is one of my first film reviews post-surgery. So, although the movie is 3 1/2 hours long, I am being very brief because I just don't have the energy to write longer AND because they are already a ton of reviews for the movie.The story involves a group of seemingly normal people who go crazy due to greed and quickly become unhinged at the process of sudden wealth. In addition to this core group, you have many cameos (many of which could have been used better) of very famous comedy actors of yesterday such as The Three Stooges, Jack Benny, Joe E. Brown and many others.So is this film a brilliant comedy? Not exactly. Subtlety certainly is NOT something you see in the film and Ethel Merman's performance is ridiculously over the top (no one is THAT obnoxious). Instead it's more a turn off your brain and just enjoy sort of movie. Funny, high energy but rarely brilliant or clever...it's well worth seeing and holds up well but also isn't a film that makes the best use of its many stars.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
1,TheLittleSongbird,"While very, very long, it still manages to be one of the funniest and most quotable comedies ever",8,2 December 2009,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was like 11 and I remember crying with laughter. This is also one of the few movies where I remember my mum rolling about on the floor with laughter. Watching it again, as I noticed its flaws, it doesn't quite wow me as much. It is very very long, and I did feel as though the film could have been trimmed a bit as there are some scenes when little happens. The flaws aside it is still one of the funniest and most quotable comedies I have ever seen. The scenery is breathtaking, and the stunts are constantly constructed at a breakneck pace and directed with unusual care and precision. The music is good too, but I have to say the quality of the script is simply genius. There are many lines that are comedy gold and ever quotable, such as ""Dingy don't let this worry you-*we're gonna get killed*!"" though my favourite is ""What do you mean who's flying the plane? No one's flying the plane!"" There are many priceless scenes, the aeroplane flying scene especially was hilarious. The performances from the entire cast are outstanding, including Spencer Tracy in his penultimate film and while he is visibly ailing he still shows he is going strong. Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Dorothy Provine and Jonathan Winters also give brilliant performances, but it is Buddy Hacket and Terry-Thomas who steal the film and with panache I must say. All in all, a long but fun and worthwhile comedy. 8/10 Bethany Cox",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
2,bkoganbing,A King With a Hundred Jesters,10,2 December 2006,"It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World has to be the funniest film ever made because no one, but Stanley Kramer ever got so many funny people together in one film. With a cast headed by his favorite dramatic player to boot. Four out of Spencer Tracy's last five films were made for Stanley Kramer. The others, Inherit the Wind, Judgment at Nuremberg, and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner dealt with weighty issues like, free speech, genocide, and interracial marriage. What It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World deals with is greed, simple normal human greed. If something looks too good to be true, chances are it is.Jimmy Durante an old time crook crashes off a highway and down a steep cliff. He's on the way to digging up the loot from a $350,000.00 robbery from years ago. His dying words tell those people went to aid him where in Santa Rosita Park the loot is buried. Off the group of them go, every man and woman for themselves, with some alliances of family and convenience. A few more treasure seekers get picked up along the way.That barebones plot description doesn't begin to tell you about some of the funny sequences that follow, Buddy Hackett and Mickey Rooney in a private plane with a drunken pilot Jim Backus passed out, Edie Adams and Sid Caesar trapped in a hardware store desperately trying to get out, Jonathan Winters as the lunkhead truck driver generally running amuck wherever he goes, and Milton Berle the henpecked husband of all time married to the beautiful Dorothy Provine, her braindead brother Dick Shawn and Ethel Merman the mother-in-law from hell. Berle has a package deal and when you watch the film, you'll see what I mean.Along the way, the treasure hunters pick up Terry-Thomas, Phil Silvers, Peter Falk and Eddie Anderson. And they leave a whole lot of some of the best character actors and comedians who each in their own way contributes a certain specialty they're famous for.There are two unbilled appearances by Jack Benny and Jerry Lewis each in situations that show off their peculiar style of comedy.Watching it all is Spencer Tracy as the Captain of Detectives of the Santa Rosita, Police Department both before the camera and between takes. I remember seeing a quotation by Stanley Kramer that with all these comedians on the set, Tracy was like a king with a hundred jesters, each looking to amuse him. Tracy besides keeping track of this freak show has some domestic problems of his own which are told in telephone conversations with the city pension bureau, his wife, and his daughter. Tracy's expressions are priceless. My favorite in this film has always been Ethel Merman. Mainly because I know someone back in Brooklyn named Gladys who's exactly like Ethel is here right down to the flaming red hair. I haven't lived in Brooklyn for nine years now, but reports I get say she hasn't changed. I can't watch this film and see Merman without thinking of dear Gladys and the schlump that married her.It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World is about greed, yet greed has never been presented with such rip roaring humor as it is in this film. For those who need a good laugh and who in this world doesn't.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
3,Leofwine_draca,Hits the mark,6,8 May 2021,"The first of the big ensemble cast chase movies from Hollywood; this genre would turn out sporadic hits for the next couple of decades, with titles like THOSE MAGNIFICENT MEN IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES and THE CANNONBALL RUN being notable examples. Although this film seems to go on forever, the wealth of comic and dramatic talent is enough to see it through, and the humour generally hits the mark which makes it a breezy watch.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
4,SnoopyStyle,I like silly slapstick but not the unlikeable characters,5,25 July 2014,"Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) loses control on a winding road and drives off a hill. People from 4 vehicles go down to help. With his last words, he tells them about a buried $350k. Melville Crump (Sid Caesar), J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett), Ding Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters) decide to keep it a secret when a police detective (Norman Fell) comes down. The group goes on a cross country race to find the money with Capt. T. G. Culpepper (Spencer Tracy) tracking them all the way.My biggest problem with this is the unlikeability of everybody. I find no rooting interest in anybody. However, there is a certain greatness about all these old-time comedians doing their shtick. Ethel Merman is a great loudmouth, but she really should be Milton Berle's wife. It's just silly to have young thing Dorothy Provine as his wife. She just gets into the way. In fact, both trophy wives are terribly stiff and does nothing more than stick their chest out. The addition of Judy Garland could have been great. My favorite of the group is Buddy Hackett. His voice is hilarious to me and the plane is great fun.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
5,Hitchcoc,Just Too Much/Media Overload,6,7 December 2016,"Just about every comic actor in the business showed up for this film. It's fun as a kind of period piece, but it doesn't help make this a well constructed film. It centers around a search for buried treasure, but that's about it. Spencer Tracy is the centering factor as his policeman investigates what's going on and then becomes part of the process. Unfortunately, there is mostly a lot of shouting and perpetual motion, but most of the bits aren't all that funny. Everything concludes in an unremarkable way. I've always felt that the comedies of the sixties were rather uninspired (dull would be a better way of putting it). My friends and I liked these movies when we were in junior high, but these things don't really stand the test of time.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
6,mark.waltz,Every comic from practically every part of the world gets to take their lumps here.,10,18 August 2014,"This is a classic comedy that some may find too stuffed with actors in cameo roles to be able to concentrate on with just one viewing and come out of it having seen everything. Having seen this in obviously edited T.V. showings while growing up, I got to see the full version in an L.A. revival house that restored so much chopped out for the network showings. This really has to be seen on a big screen to appreciate in its entirety, because even in letterbox versions, so much ends up being lost on a small screen, even a medium sized T.V.A group of strangers all band together to find the mysterious ""W"" which is the clue to the location of loot stashed by a bank robber (the fabulous schnozola himself, Jimmy Durante), and greed takes over as they try to out-do each other to get their first. There's trucker Jonathan Winters, bickering Sid Caesar and Edie Adams, pals Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett, and a traveling married couple (Milton Berle and Dorothy Provine), stuck with her battle-axe of a mother (Ethel Merman in one of the most delightfully obnoxious characterizations outside of Shelley Winters). They are joined by a variety of others whom they meet on the way, most notably the obviously self-centered Phil Silvers who literally licks his lips upon finding out about the treasure and Terry-Thomas as the very droll Englishman who picks up Berle, Provine and la Merm. Merman keeps trying without fruition to get ahold of her babied younger son (Dick Shawn), a poster child for fool if there ever was one who just happens to live in the same city as the location of the mysterious ""W"", whatever that happens to be.These senseless people's moves are followed by local police chief Spencer Tracy who has been out to solve this case for decades, literally on the verge of retirement and set to take a vacation with his whiny wife (the voice of Selma Diamond, no less). But Tracy has his own agenda, proving that temptation is sometimes greater than common sense, something his boss William Demarest obviously has but didn't think his protégée lacked. Along the way there are cameos by such comical actors as Jim Backus, Don Knotts, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, Peter Falk, Zasu Pitts, Charles Lane and Joe E. Brown, not to mention a few unbilled surprises here and there. There's adventure driving cross country, danger in the air, and a hysterical come-uppance for the greedy group on a rickety fire escape. There's also a title song, cut from T.V. prints that confused me when I got the film soundtrack, but was there plain as day on the video release and the big screen when I saw that.Stanley Kramer, a producer and director who could be called the David Selznick of his day, went all out for this. If you think he had stars for ""Judgment at Nuremberg"", he's overloaded them here, evidenced in the credits where the cast list seems to go on forever. Tracy totally underplays his part while the comical actors he's surrounded by seem to be going out of their way to see who can give the biggest performance. To see Merman and Miltie playing mother and son-in-law (and being close together in age themselves) is comic enough, and to see her constantly assaulting him and Terry-Thomas with her purse, then getting tipped over several times to reveal her undergarments, will leave you gasping for air after laughing. I don't think they give Oscars for obnoxiousness, but Merman certainly deserved a nomination for her ability to get laughs for being so delightfully hateful.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
7,classicsoncall,"""So come on. Let's have one big adventure!""",7,14 June 2019,"You probably have to be over, say, about forty years of age to appreciate this film if you're watching it today. The story is kind of unexceptional and some of the slapstick is way overdone and cheesy. The merit for Baby Boomers like myself, is seeing so many of the era's comedy greats in one place at one time. The cast is a stellar Who's Who of comedians and comic actors and getting them all together to make the film must have been some kind of whirlwind process. Heading the cast is the venerable Spencer Tracy, who portrays just about the only character who doesn't compete for comedy honors, playing it straight throughout except when it comes time to wrap things up. And they do get wrapped up in a rather serious fashion, but you'll have to see the film to check that out.Things get under way with Jimmy Durante sailing off a cliff in a speeding automobile, but before he quite literally kicks the bucket, mentions to a coterie of bystanders that he's got a stash of three hundred fifty thousand dollars buried under the 'Big W' somewhere in the Santa Rosita countryside. From there on it's a mad scramble of folks trying to outdo each other to get to and claim the big prize. There's a core group of treasure hunters that includes Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett and Jonathan Winters, but besides them, the fun is in catching all the other players who come and go during the nearly three hour chase. Phil Silvers shows up pretty much doing his Sergeant Bilko schtick, while Jack Benny makes a quick appearance to relay his single word signature line. Some of the cameos are a complete blur, like Leo Gorcey as the first cab driver, and Buster Keaton as the garage attendant near the end of the story when Spencer Tracy's trying to make a quick getaway.With the all star lineup, and I can't imagine what the payroll would have been for this flick, the film makers did take some noticeable shortcuts, like the flimsy garage operated by Ray (Arnold Stang) and Irwin (Marvin Kaplan). For example, there are no bathrooms behind the 'Men' and 'Women' doors inside the establishment, so when the walls come down in that bizarre melee with Lennie Pike (Winters), all you've got is the surrounding countryside. There's also all that money that's neatly bundled when the core group digs it up, which goes fluttering away as a flurry of bills when it's lost in a 'Sierra Madre' moment near the finale.None of it matters though if you grew up in the Fifties and Sixties and got to see these greats in their own shows and stand up routines. Jack Benny and sidekick Eddie' Rochester' Anderson were favorites of mine, and I always got a kick out of Andy Devine and William Demarest. They're all here and a whole host of others you'll be trying to pick out amidst all the mayhem going on. And if you're intimidated by the length of the movie going in, watch it in a couple of installments like I did, and it won't seem nearly as long.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
8,lee_eisenberg,The funniest movie of all time,10,2 April 2005,"Gee, what can I say about ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World""? It's a laugh riot from start to finish. Whether it's Jonathan Winters demolishing a garage and making mincemeat of the owners, Buddy Hackett and Mickey Rooney having a horrific time flying an airplane, Sid Caesar and Edie Adams experiencing a miniature Fourth of July while locked in a hardware store basement, Milton Berle and Terry-Thomas beating the stuffings out of each other to settle their nationalistic quarrel, Ethel Merman obnoxiously ordering everyone around while Dorothy Provine gets increasingly embarrassed, Phil Silvers sinking into a supposedly shallow stream, Dick Shawn getting angry about people ""bugging"" him, or Spencer Tracy at the center of the big chase at the end, any person with even the smallest sense of humor will easily get a kick out of this movie.Usually, ""IAMMMMW"" has been classified as a silly comedy, but I believe that it was actually all about greed: upon learning of the $350,000 buried under a big W, the characters proceed to do quite literally anything to get there. By anything, I mean they double-cross each other quite a bit.As for the many cameos and bit parts, everyone contributes their fair share: Eddie Anderson and Peter Falk play cabbies who keep wondering about ""the picks and shovels,"" Jim Backus plays a pilot who has alcoholic drinks while in flight (uh-oh!), Jesse White and Carl Reiner play air traffic controllers who have a hard time helping a plane land, and Jimmy Durante, Jack Benny, Don Knotts and Jerry Lewis also appear.So, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" is, in my opinion, the funniest movie ever made. It is truly a pleasure watching this plethora of people get their comeuppance just because they were so greedy. Absolutely perfect.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
9,jboothmillard,It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,4,6 January 2008,"This was the film that inspired Jerry Zucker's Rat Race, with an all-star cast, all racing to the same place to get to the fortune first, from director Stanley Kramer (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner). Basically somewhere in the desert, a car speeds along the roads, and the driver (Jack Benny) loses control sailing off the cliff. Four other vehicles are near, they stop to help, and the driver tells them in his dying moments that he has $350,000 below a giant ""W"" in Santa Rosita, some 200 miles away, and then he dies. For a few minutes they question his claim, then a few seconds later they start the race. They do stop a few minutes to try and come to an agreement if it is true and they do have to divide the cash, but they can't work it out, so they are all against each other trying to get to it first. The only other person that knew about the fortune before they did is Capt. C. G. Culpepper (Spencer Tracy, in his penultimate film, before Guess Who's Coming to Dinner) who is keeping track of them all, until eventually he gives in to his greed as well. To be honest, not that many moments stick out in my mind, besides some explosions, chaos in a plane, and of course the all-star cast. I thought it only got interesting when they reached the destination, they are looking for the giant ""W"", which turns out to be some palm trees, they do find it, but Culpepper persuades them to hand themselves in (to jail), this is how he nicks it from them. In the end, they are all hanging on fire escape ladders, the money falls into the large crowd below, and all characters go to hospital after falling in various ways. Starring Milton Berle as J. Russell Finch, Sid Caesar as Melville Crump, DDS; Buddy Hackett as Benjy Benjamin, Ethel Merman as the irritatingly loud and talkative Mrs. Marcus, Mickey Rooney as Ding 'Dingy' Bell, Dick Shawn as Sylvester Marcus, Phil Silvers as Otto Meyer, Terry-Thomas as Lt.Col. J. Algernon Hawthorne, Golden Globe nominated Jonathan Winters as Lennie Pike, Edie Adams as Monica Crump, Dorothy Provine as Emeline Marcus-Finch, Peter Falk as Third cab driver, Jimmy Durante as Smiler Grogan, Buster Keaton as Jimmy the Crook, Carl Reiner as Tower controller at Rancho Conejo, Jim Backus as Tyler Fitzgerald, Jerry Lewis as Man who runs over hat, Leo Gorcey as First cab driver and Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson as Second cab driver. Maybe if this was a little shorter, with more memorable gags this could have been a favourite of mine, like Rat Race (which I prefer to this), but plenty of famous faces to keep you interested. It won the Oscar for Best Sound Effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Song for the title song, Best Music for Ernest Gold and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy.

10,ccthemovieman-1,"Yes, It's Loud But It's An Incredible Comedy Classic",7,27 April 2006,"Well, if I named all the famous comedians who were in this film it would a long, long review. Just check the credits - it's unbelievable! Suffice to say, it was an ""all-star"" cast of everybody you could think of who was a big-name comedian in 1963 including some old-timers like Mickey Rooney, Milton Berle, etc. Add a famous dramatic actor, Spencer Tracy, to the mix,, too, and you have one of the most famous comedies ever put on film.When I saw this in the theater, and even in the '80s on tape, I liked it immensely, but now it's just a bit loud and too much for me in spots. I'm either getting too old or this film is getting to look dated and corny.....probably both. However, if you want three hours of pure lunacy and escapist fare, you could do a whole lot worse.Despite all the shouting, this film has some of the all-time most memorable comedy scenes ever put on film. Plus, unlike today's comedies, there is no profanity, no sex, no blood....just silliness and one wild scene after another, with an unbelievable slapstick ending atop a building. For anyone who collects movies, or enjoys a good laugh, this a ""must"" for your collection, and I don't say that very often. However, as I get older, all that yelling and screaming has made me downgrade my rating from 10 to 9 to 8 and now 7.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
11,Tweekums,A bit long but contains plenty of laughs,8,14 February 2012,"As four vehicles drive along a desert highway in California they are started when a fifth vehicle passes at speed; goes off the road and crashes. They are all sure the driver must be dead but when they get to him they find that he isn't quite gone; before dying he tells them how he has buried $350,000 under the 'Big W' in Santa Rosita State Park... and so begins a madcap chase as the drivers and their passengers do everything they can to make sure that they get there first. They include Dentist Melville Crump and his wife, Trucker Lenny Pike, a pair of comedy writers named Dingy and Benjy and Mr Finch, is wife and his battle-axe of a mother in law. Along the way they are joined by Lt. Col. J. Algernon Hawthorne, a British officer and the devious Otto Meyer. On the way they frequently fall out with each other, crash and have to find new vehicles and on one case even get locked in the basement of a hardware store! All the while they race towards the money they have no idea that the police led by Captain Culpepper of the Santa Rosita Police Department is watching every move they make. Most of the characters are just greedy and fairly unlikeable and that is what makes it so funny when yet another thing goes wrong for them. Even when it looks like it is all over and the money is found there is a twist that leads to somebody we hadn't even realised was in the race runs off with the cash with the others in pursuit! While the plot of this film is as simple as it gets it is a lot of fun watching the top quality cast get into a series of hilarious scrapes... it even manages to make the old cliché of slipping on a banana peel funny; largely because it couldn't have happened to a more deserving person! The greedy gang includes such comic talents as Phil Silvers, Terry Thomas, Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney and Sid Caesar and playing it straight is Spencer Tracy as Capt. Culpepper; the man who has been waiting fifteen years to close the case of the stolen money. The action sequences look great as cars race recklessly along the mountainous desert roads; unfortunately when we see close-ups of the cars' occupants the back projection is fairly obvious although I don't know how that problem could have been avoided back then. At over two and a half hours in length, longer in some versions, the film is a bit on the long side however it does have enough laughs to sustain this length and only a few scenes drag a bit. Another thing in this film's favour compared to most modern comedies is the fact that it never relies on smut or bad language to get a laugh so is suitable for people of all ages.

12,moonspinner55,Elephantine mad scramble for money...greed and grievances served up with a joy buzzer,4,1 April 2017,"Everything about Stanley Kramer's high-decibel all-star comedy ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" screams BIG! (beginning with the film's ungainly title and Saul Bass's unreadable, crazy-quilt opening credits). A dying man in the California desert gives a group of bickering auto travelers a tip where to find some hidden loot--350 G's; the group discusses divvying up the money fairly once it's found, but soon turn on each other in a winner-take-all scramble. It isn't clear if the screenplay by William and Tania Rose was originally this caustic, or if the shrill, continually grating quality of the picture came into play once the actors stepped in front of the cameras. Kramer, not known for his comedic expertise, directs everyone the same way: the bigger, the better. As such, some of the finest comic personalities of the 1950s (as well as top-billed Spencer Tracy playing it fairly straight as a police captain) are not shown to any useful advantage. A young movie-watcher unaware of the reputations of Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters, Mickey Rooney, Ethel Merman, Jim Backus, Buddy Hackett, Phil Silvers and Jimmy Durante might be excused for temporarily assuming this group was nothing more than a collection of overeager hams. The flying insults, ghastly screams and grasping hands are more than enough to do the expensive production in...that is, until Kramer and his editing team made the decision to let the movie run an astounding 192 minutes.

13,Quinoa1984,"if you want it ALL, here it is - and the range in quality is immense",7,25 November 2014,"When it comes to Stanley Kramer's HUGE attempt at comedy - looking at his credits he usually wasn't a ball of laughs (i.e. holocaust, racism) - I really wish I saw this as a kid first.It has that big dumb broad humor that maybe I liked more as a real little kid who just loved seeing people acting crazy and cartoonish. Seeing it now, I probably respect it more than I overall *like* it. And yet, it's a wild feat, and it's the movie that reminded me I must watch everything Jonathan winters ever did. Other highlights include Dick Shawn (every single moment, cracking up), Peter Falk, some of the Milton Berle scenes, and that one moment where Buddy Hackett just stares at Spencer Tracy. And of course some of the set pieces are just so tremendous, particularly the climactic chase and high-wire comedy on the fire truck, which makes the Blues Brothers look like child's play.Some of it, for me, is just TOO loud and TOO one note (Ethel Merman, Jesus) and some of the hijinks end up being very funny one moment and just not funny at all the next. It's one of the most inconsistent epics of all time, and is wildly hit or miss beat to beat. For all the times that a gag worked or a line or a look, another minute something would come up that could grate on my nerves, be a bit dated or, again all down to subjectivity, fall flat.But it's the quintessential ""zany"" 60s comedy, much the way that Kramer was always after that ""quintessential"" thing with the movies he made - for better and worse, that's what he did. Needless to say if you want to see MOST of the best talent in comedy in the first half of the 20th century - from Buster Keaton to Carl Reiner - it's in a super deluxe platter of madness like the parody version of The Good the Bad and the Ugly years before it was made.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

This sets off a wild and extremely memorable chase by those who have heard his words. Others will join in this mayhem.Kramer knew how to get every well known comedian into this hysterically funny film.Often used by Stanley Kramer in his other dramatic films, Spencer Tracy, as the frustrated police officer does an unusual comic performance and he was really good at it.Sid Caesar and Edie Adams are phenomenal as well as the dentist and his wife caught up in this chase for the money. Milton Berle goes through plenty with a mother-in-law such as Ethel Merman. The casting director deserves a lot of credit here for casting Ethel in the loud-mouth mother-in-law role. She really steals the films with her hysteria and antics. I would have thought of Connie Gilchrist for the part of Mrs. Marcus, but Merman is in fine form here. She gets great additional support from Dick Shawn, who portrays her crazy son and British comedian Terry-Thomas who meets up with the group and is drawn into the conspiracy.Phil Silvers is at his devilish best here. The way he orders around people reminds us of his presence as Sgt. Bilko in that classic television series. Jonathan Winters will just break you up here, especially when he goes berserk and destroys a gas station run by Marvin Kaplan and Arnold Stang, who were also made for their parts.The film may exaggerate what people would do for the mighty buck but it gives you the feel-good attitude and is certainly a classic to behold.The film also reunited Tracy with Mickey Rooney, 25 years after they made Tracy's Oscar-winning ""Boys Town.""The film marked the end of Za-Su Pitts' career. Ailing during the film, she died of cancer the same year the film came out. Note that Paul Ford, Ben Blue and Carl Reiner, all had smaller roles in this film but would be used 4 years later in the equally hilarious ""The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming.""A time honored classic.

So I find myself here in my middle age with mixed feelings after just revisiting this extravaganza for the first time in many a year.It's very much a film of three parts to me, and each part impacts differently on the entertainment scale. The first part of this multi cast piece is as madcap and as mirthful as you could honestly wish to see, but this sadly ill prepares you for a middle part that outstays its welcome to the point that you can't believe they stretched it to an original cut of 3 hours! The final third of the film saves it from smug overkill because by now you have invested so much time into the film, you thank the gods for any sort of frivolity - and thankfully the film does lift you back up to the happy place that you had visited an hour previously.The cast are fine, where some brilliant shows are mixed in with the merely acceptable ones, and I wouldn't want to be so churlish as to dissect each actors respective show. However, as a Phil Silvers fan I'm rewarded plenty enough and as a Spencer Tracy acolyte I'm burning candles again in his honour. Yet it's Ethel Merman as Mrs. Marcus that lives long and glorious in the memory here, and honestly I feel the film is worth a watch purely just for her.

I saw the uncut version on a big screen years ago and didn't laugh once. Seeing it on TV (letter boxed on TCM) didn't change things. I have some friends who find this hysterical but it really escapes me.I find the humor in this film labored and obvious with tons of unfunny slapstick. There's next to no characterization and the all star cast just seems intent on seeing who can scream the loudest (Ethel Merman wins hands down). Also it's embarrassing to see the great Spencer Tracy reduced to this--I find nothing funny about seeing him (actually a very obvious stunt double) running up and down flights of stairs again and again (a very strained running joke). The only fun in this film is seeing all the actors who pop up for small cameos (my favorite was Jack Benny). Still, they aren't enough to stop this film from being stupid, boring and (sometimes) quite violent. If you love violent slapstick you might enjoy this.

It also gave us the not-so-serious but no less boring ""cameo"" pseudo-adventure pics like ""Around the World in 80 Days,"" which existed mainly as celebrity-spotting exercises for the movie audiences, and which I guess were supposed to tickle people silly by giving them a chance to recognize obsolete and creaky film stars popping up in bit roles as chauffeurs, doormen, organ grinders, etc. So it was only a matter of time before Hollywood would give us a new mutation of the formula: the epic ""cameo"" comedy.""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" is of course ridiculously long, grotesquely overblown and as overstuffed as a Thanksgiving turkey, but it also happens to work a sort of charm on its audience. Anyone who was anyone in the world of film comedy appears in the picture, either in a lead or cameo role, and the results are nearly frightening: any single member of the cast could (and did) carry films on their own, so when you throw them all together, it's like a shark feeding frenzy, with each actor trying his or her damnedest to shout down the others in an attempt to steal the scene. Some, like Ethel Merman for example, are better suited for this than others, and they're the ones that you'll remember later.If watched in a certain frame of mind, ""...Mad World"" is grim and grueling, working over time to wring laughs out of its high-concept premise.

29,SimonJack,Thin plot binds one hilarious scene after another,9,2 May 2015,"With a cast of 50 people, including many big names of the movies and comedies of the era, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" is one of the funniest movies of all time. It may be the very best and funniest film of those that barely have a plot. It has just enough of one to set in motion the hijinks and madcap race of numerous people to find their fortune, ""tax free."" All of the cast perform very well. Some stand out for their characters or particularly funny lines. Ethel Merman plays perfectly the nagging, shrill-voiced mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus, whom no one can stand. Buddy Hackett is excellent as Benjy Benjamin, both for his character portrayal and some very funny lines. Phil Silvers is Otto Meyer, and reprises his Sgt. Bilko character to a tee; only this time he is as much disliked for his conniving as we find him funny. Terry-Thomas is the English gentleman, J. Algernon Hawthorne, who is ""actually Colonel Hawthorne."" He, too, has a touch of greed amidst his genteelness. Peter Falk and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson have somewhat smaller roles as cabbies, but their roles and lines are very funny. Others of the big name stars, Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar and Mickey Rooney have very good roles and some funny scenes, but otherwise straight dialog. The many smaller roles are funny or lend to the hilarity. Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny and the Three Stooges have very funny cameos. But, you'll notice I haven't yet mentioned one name that has a prominent role. Jonathan Winters as Lennie Pike steals every scene in which he appears. His character, his expressions, his temperament, and his lines at times are riotously funny. One particularly laugh out loud scene is the fight between Thomas's Hawthorne and Milton Berle's Russell Finch. I couldn't stop laughing in the long scene of Lennie Pike tearing into the two service station owners, Ray (played by Arnold Stang) and his partner after they tie him up. I can't think of another film that had such a hilarious total demolition of a set. Each encounter after that between Winters and Silvers was hilarious. Two of the funniest scenes also had the dialog to match the facial expressions and the setting. Jonathan Winters and Buddy Hackett are the laughter kings in these scenes. In the first, Hackett's Benjy says, ""So now, there's only one way to figure it. And that is, every man  including the old bag (Mrs. Marcus), for herself."" Mickey Rooney's Ding Bell says, ""So, good luck and may the best man win."" Benjy, ""Right! Except you, lady. May you just drop dead."" Pike, ""All right. All right. We all agree on that.""I'm chuckling as I write this last hilarious scene. Winters' Pike says, ""If we find the money we still have to report the taxes. Otherwise it's like stealing from the government."" Melville Crump (played by Sid Caesar) says, ""Could you explain it to him please?"" Berle's Russell Finch, ""Who me? Well, don't you see, if we find the money, there may not be any taxes to pay on it  just because we did find the money."" (Winters has an incredulous look of disbelief on his face). Finch continues, ""What he was trying to say is "" Pike interrupts, ""Everybody has to pay taxes. Even businessmen that rob and steal and cheat from people every day  even they have to pay taxes.""This movie came out while I was serving in the Army in Europe, during the Cold War. I didn't see it for the first time until years later on TV. I think movie buffs today will find it as funny as it must have been when it came out. It's a very good family film for lots of laughs.

33,ElMaruecan82,"Automobiles, Planes, Ham and Cheese...",7,7 February 2021,"""Ninety-nine percent is the delivery. If you have the right voice and the right delivery, you're cocky enough, and you pound down the punchline, you can say anything and make people laugh maybe three times before they realize you're not telling jokes""That's wisdom spoken by Buddy Hackett, American comedian and part of the comical cohort that drives insanity in Stanley Kramer's epic comedy ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (yes, four times). I like that quote because it sums up exactly what goes right in the film and incidentally, what goes wrong.Let's start with the wrong: this is a comedy that basically relies on one joke: a group of drivers whose various backgrounds are defined by their vehicle, sees a car careening off the road before falling down into a ravine. For the eminent role of the mess-starter, a VIP comedian was needed, so it is Jimmy Durante who reveals that there's a baggage full of 350 grand buried somewhere in Santa Rosita (California) under a big W before kicking the bucket... literally and figuratively.And so the crazy chase across (and above) the landscapes of California can start. It's a one-joke film but director Stanley Kramer decided to tackle the material epic-style, making it (no pun intended) a vehicle for all the 'with it' comedians of 1963 and a few veterans such as the Three Stooges or Buster Keaton. I admire ambition and making the ""comedy that would end all comedies"" carries itself the very madness the title insists upon (not three but four times).Problem is: Kramer is certainly a competent director and all stunt and action sequences are handled as confidently as if they belonged to a thriller... but Kramer isn't much of a comic. His direcorial instinct doesn't succeed in grasping that the comical premise is perfect for a shorter runtime and what he does is stretching the film's concept like a chewing gum until the script gets as thin as a nylon thread. He was as oblivious to it as the protagonists who couldn't see the big W when it hit them (one of the film's greatest gags) anyway, even as an action film, it is just too long..So in both genres, the plot overstays its welcome, a shame because it starts very well and ends with a magnificent homage to acrobatic slapstick à la Harold Lloyd and Warner Bros cartoons, but the in-between part is more problematic, and the redundancy of some situations and the way Kramer lingers on the whole chase amount to boredom and that 'W' is mostly anticipated but not for the good reasons. As Hackett would put it: it's all in the delivery.And I guess that's why comedies dwell on short formats, gags have basic structures: anticipation, action and punchline, and if you take the plot as one big gag, well, the later the punchline, the less rewarding. The plot is set-up by Durante's dying words, the vertiginous ladder sequence and the hospital scene are the perfect ending to the mazy and messy race, but the middle plot wouldn't have suffered a half-hour trimming if only to allow the best gags to emerge out of the mess. Ultimately, some visual gags don't simply match the film's pretension for 'fast-paced and never ending goofiness', there are moments of relative dryness that make you feel you're watching a long film, with a long title, a long credits song, well, a film longer than it is mad.Now to the good stuff, as Hackett said, if you have talented comedians, whatever they say will be funny if they're not even trying. And since the plot is a laundry-line to hang as many crazy situations as possible, you've got to credit the stars who give all their heart even for the paper-thin script, Mickey Rooney and his Buddy Hackett, Jonathan Winters who's the blue-collar punching ball to the sneaky late comer Phil Silvers, Terry-Thomas as the mld English tourist, Sid Caesar as the well-meaning banker and Milton Berle as the henpecked husband who's got to endure his nagging stepmother played by Ethel Merman (the film won an Oscar for Sound Editing, they should have done something for the decibels she kept erupting all throughout the chase), even Jerry Lewis in his cameo, they all inhabit their characters with admirable dedication and build irresistible magic out of pure hammy and cheesy and lousy stuff. So the film is more a patchwork of great comedies than a great comedy itself.And within that linear trajectory where everyone tries to converge to the same destination, there're the central point of the film, the one who doesn't move and strikes as the voice of reason, he's played by Spencer Tracy as Police Captain Culpepper. Yes, there's a catch to his apparent stoicism and relative quietness and Kramer, while not a comedian, knew some basic principles: he couldn't make good comedy without one straight man. The final act of the film contradicts our expectations but does it in a sneakily clever way that indicates the way greed and money drove people in the pianncle of the motor era.The film is not only a time capsule of the then-comedic scene, but of the pre-oil-crisis industrial age, it's a film about money where you can tell that even its glorious cast and big-scaled making wasn't made without cash registers sounds ringing in Kramer's head.Anyway, the late director didn't terminate the comedy genre but elevated instrad at the highest pedestal, using the best of physicality and slapstick especially in its cartoonish climax that reveals a tad too late how the film could have been much funnier. And what to say about the final gag? slipping on a darn banana peel.That made me realize that sometimes the simplest and lousiest jokes can make the whole world (or a few hospital patients) roar with laughter. And it was contagious laugh and a strike of genius. At least, there's another principle of comedy the film got right, the destination matters more than the journey.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
34,gbill-74877,Madcap,9,31 May 2019,"I'll always love this film. One reason is that so many of the actors tickle me over the smallest things - their way of speaking, how they move, or their facial expressions ... Jonathan Winters, Buddy Hackett, Phil Silvers, and Terry-Thomas all come to mind. Winters tip-toeing, riding the little girl bicycle, the surprising indignation (""what do you mean tax free?""), and pouting when the other drivers don't stop for him...he is simply a delight. Hackett's face throughout the film cracks me up, especially when Jim Backus makes him take control of the airplane so he can go make himself another drink. Silvers way of fast talking and spurring people into action, especially when he's getting frustrated is quite humorous. ""Oh kid, you better get that bike outta there, someone's liable to trip over it in the dark,"" he tells Winters, to trick him before driving off. And Terry-Thomas with that fantastic English accent voicing lines of politeness, urgency, criticism against America, and irritation all brilliantly. When wanting to move things along, I've found myself thinking or saying ""I say we must press on"" or ""We really must get cracking"" over the years.The rest of the principal cast is strong as well. Sid Ceasar seems to be a rational guy but does crazy things in the airplane and then while trapped in the hardware store (""Why can't you have a little confidence in me?"" he yells at Edie Adams, his wife, who is clearly smarter than him). Mickey Rooney (playing a character named Ding Bell, lol) is a good foil to Hackett, and Ethel Merman is a force to reckon with as Milton Berle's mother-in-law, though the over-bearing woman trope isn't my favorite thing in the world. The only dud is Dorothy Provine, who plays Berle's wife and lacks spark (though certainly a part of this was the role). It's all anchored by Spencer Tracy in his penultimate film at the age of 63 - he looks about two decades older, but still had the stuff.The film is also special because of the huge number of comedians from Hollywood past and present who make an appearance one way or another - seemingly everyone who was anyone, some remembered as much today, many others less so. The cameos start in that beautiful opening sequence with mad driving and a crash, followed by Jimmy Durante telling others of the secret treasure hidden ""under a big W"" before he (literally) kicks the bucket, thus setting off the mad race. Along the way we see all sorts of other comedians, e.g. Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny, Don Knotts etc and it added another fun element for me, though I wish some of them had been used a little better - most notably Buster Keaton towards the end.The action is madcap and over-the-top for nearly all of its three hour run time, with scenes like Winters tearing apart a gas station (which looks like it's made out of balsa wood) and countless other acts of zaniness, some of which has aged better than others. The script is peppered with lots of chuckle-worthy moments, and the cuts between all of the misadventures the various characters find themselves by director Stanley Kramer are good, especially leading in to the intermission. It feels a little exhausting by the time the film is over, but there's never a dull moment in all this lunacy.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

No, it's just great fun.In reading some of the other reviews here, it's clear that younger audiences just don't get it. Partly they don't get because today slapstick isn't quite as respected as it once was. But also, younger audiences don't get what spectacular casting was included in this motion picture. The whole story is held together by Spencer Tracy, considered by many critics to be one of the very finest of all American actors. Milton Berle -- Mr. Television. Sid Caesar -- another pioneer of television. Ethel Merman -- star of stage and screen. Jonathan Winters -- one of the greatest of all comedic minds. Mickey Rooney -- one of the two or three greatest former child actors. Buddy Hackett -- at the time one of the leading monologists. Phil Silvers. Terry-Thomas.

36,atlasmb,Plus It Includes Spencer Tracy,9,19 December 2015,"When director Stanley Kramer assembled the cast for ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", the comedians were standing in line for a chance to appear in the film. The result is a veritable Who's Who of comedy from silent film days to 1961. (Check out ""Rat Race"" (2001) for another comedy with a large ensemble.)I saw IAMMMMW at a drive-in on its first release. I enjoyed the film, with its cartoonish action and characters. It was like watching Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner (and friends) played with human actors. Over time, it has not become dated. In fact, I enjoy it more today. As an older viewer, I can better appreciate the subtleties of the performances (even within the slapstick) and the quality of the script. Also, even though I knew who most of the actors were back in 1961, I now have a greater respect for and knowledge of their abilities and careers.There are so many talents in this film, both as leads and as supporting actors and in cameos. But there are a few who really drive this comedy. Jonathan Winters, for example, plays a manic character who is like an unstoppable force. Dick Shawn portrays a kooky, west coast surfer dude like no one else can. Ethel Merman--surprisingly--is like a walking punchline, giving all of the actors something to play off of--like an MVP. And Phil Silvers always makes me laugh, with his ""Why I oughta"" snarkiness.For cinema fans, this is a film that should be watched for its record of comedic talent. Consider Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Terry Thomas, Don Knotts, Jimmy Durante, and Jerry Lewis, just to name a few.

Before he dies, Grogan confides with the witnesses of his car crash, that there is a $300,000 fortune, in which, he stole that is all buried in a park 200 miles away. This inspires, all of the witnesses, to search for this treasure in a free-for-all rat race to the cash. Directed by Stanley Kramer, this slapstick comedy was mostly funny. I love the stunt work in this film. The film was so crammed with action that each leading actor was given two scripts: one for the dialogue and one for physical comedy. However, the film does kinda fall apart, when the police tracking subplot, kicks in. I really don't like how the police, are allowing these idiots to endangering innocent bystanders, with their reckless driver, and odd behavior. There is a scene, where one of the treasure pursuers kidnap a kid and another is planning to set off a bomb for goodness sakes. You would think, it's there, that they could step in, and control these people. I just found it to be too unrealistic not to notice. Another scene that kinda ruins the film is the ladder scene toward the end. I found that sequence, to be a bit over the top with the fake looking stop-motion special effects. It really doesn't hold up. Sorry, to say this, but that whole sequence looks really dated. Another problem with this film, is the pacing. The preview version of this film clocks in, with a length of 210 minutes resulted from a 5-hour-long work-print. Kramer himself made further cuts for its theatrical release which is also super-long with 192 minutes. But that still wasn't enough for producers United Artists, because they intended to show the movie in theaters as often as possible on one single day. As a result, the studio made further cuts on their own, with 161 minutes without Kramer's involvement. It wasn't until later, that a ""final"" theatrical version was made with both director and producers. Weighting in, with 154 mins running time. This version of the film, is almost the only option to watch the movie, even these days. If anything, the best result of getting everything, you need out of the movie, is to check out the 1991's Special Edition version. This Special Edition contains delete footages found in the archives. Admittedly, the new footage does often some differs from the rest, but unfortunately, only 20 minutes of the footage could have been reconstructed. Another problem is how roughly, it has been reinserted. While, technically, the Special Edition isn't the original Director's Cut, however the resulting version runs more smoothly than the others film versions. Nevertheless, the positive impression of this edition overbalances the negatives. Anyway, no matter, which version, you watch. This comedy is still a marathon to get through. It took me, a few seats to finally, finished this movie. Another problem with this film, is the huge cast. There are just way too much characters to remember. The film starts out with a few characters of the main cast; J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), an entrepreneur who owns Pacific Edible Seaweed Company in Fresno, Melville Crump (Sid Caesar), a local dentist; Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters), a furniture mover; Dingy Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett), two friends on their way to Las Vegas; that for the most part, were very entertaining and funny. However, I couldn't say, the same for the female cast; while Crump's wife, Monica (Edie Adams) & Finch's wife (Emmeline Marcus-Finch (Dorothy Provine) was mediocre, and kinda bland. Yes, all the character driven by all-consuming greed, but it's Mrs. Marcus (Ethel Merman) who takes the cake for the most annoying character in this film. All of her screaming and whining, really made this film, hard to watch, at times. I really couldn't stand, any scenes that had her, there. Despite that, there were a lot of supporting actors that really shine in this film. Terry-Thomas as, British scientist, Lt. Col. J. Algernon Hawthorne and Spencer Tracy as Captain T. G. Culpeper, the local police trying to solve this case were some of those secret gems. Dick Shawn as Sylvester Marcus and Phil Silvers as Otto Meyer, also did fine, adding to the madness of the film. But, some of the other celebrity cameos in this film, felt a little bit wasted. Actors like Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis, Don Knotts, and Carl Reiner should had played, a bigger role than what they got. However, they do kinda shine, within the small roles, they got. One thing, I could do, without seeing is Buster Keaton, and The Three Stooges. They look way past, their prime. All four of them, look creepier than ever. Even with that, the movie does have other good things going for it. The opening animated credits, designed by Saul Bass was amazing. The main theme song by composter Ernest Gold, really sound joyful. It's remind me of a silly circus. The 1960s vibe in the rest of the music was rich as hell, too. I really can't stop, laughing at the 'Thirty-one Flavors' go-go dance scene. It was so odd and yet, so charming. Overall: I have to say, you have to be bat-sh*t crazy to hate this movie! It was a lot of fun. Yes, it's not the funniest movie ever, but a film worth checking out. This movie proves without a doubt, that the world is full of crazy people willing to do anything for money. If you don't find that funny; then you're mad, in a bad way.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
38,kenjha,All-Star Lunacy,7,13 October 2007,"Perhaps no other movie in history has as many well-known actors as this elaborate comedy, including cameos by the likes of Jack Benny and The Three Stooges. It is an entertaining film, but everything about this movie is excessive. Some of the scenes (such as the fight between Winters and the two guys at the service station) just go on so long that they lose their comic edge. Much of the comedy is rather predictable and cartoony but there's nothing wrong with that. This is an anomaly in the career of Kramer, who was known for directing heavy-handed social dramas, but he manages to keep it enjoyable despite the enormous length.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
39,The-Sarkologist,Leave this movie relegated to the past,3,23 February 2013,"I remember watching this movie a long time ago when I was young. I used to watch Wonder Woman at the time, but I guess the season had finished and I was at a loose end, so I watched this movie instead. However, many years later (ie recently) I got the opportunity to watch it again to see what it was like. In a nutshell I was unimpressed, very unimpressed.Four cars are driving along the highway from Los Angeles to Las Vegas when a fifth car speeds past them, loses control, and flies over the edge of a cliff. Not really wanting to get involved, the four cars pull over and the occupants, after a brief discussion, decided to attempt to help the driver out. When they reach him they discover that he is dying, and in his dying breath, he tells them of a treasure hidden in San Dieago, and this sets them all off on an adventure to be the first to locate it.If this one movie has a theme it is that the pursuit of greed will turn even the most noble character mad. In fact the title reflects the insanity of all of the main actors as they attempt to outdo each other to get to this wealth. Honest police officers become corrupt, loving partners split up, and friends become enemies as each and every one of them attempts to get to the money.In fact, the more they pursue this money, the more help they seek, and the more people become involved in the chase. By the end of the movie there is a whole hoard of people all chasing this money. In the end, they all land up in hospital without a cent to their name. The money is gone, their friends have deserted them, their wives have turned their backs on them, and the police sergeant is up on charges of corruption. All this for money.What annoyed me even more was that this movie was supposed to be a comedy. Unfortunately (or should I say fortunately), I really do not find people treading on each others toes or stabbing each other in the back all that amusing. I guess some people do, but I am not one of them. As for this movie, don't waste your time. You will never get it back.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

Whatever the media, the comedies are always perhaps the most sought-after commodity. This is a universal truth, wherever the locale. (We once saw a list of the top 10 Radio Programs of the year of 1942. It was published in Chuck Schaeden's NOSTALGIA DIGEST & RADIO GUIDE (a companion to his ""Those Were The Days"" Old Time Radio Syndicated Radio Show. It was no surprise to find that 7 of the 10 top shows were comedies; with the likes of JACK BENNY, FRED ALLEN, FIBBER McGEE AND MOLLY and AMOS ""N"" ANDY all finishing in the Chip$.AS far as motion pictures, the laugh, be it in a Comedy Short, an Animated Cartoon Short or a Feature Film from the likes of names such as Frank Capra, Leo McCarey, Ernst Lubitsch or Preston Sturgis, has been a most admired commodity. Comedy Teams such as Clark & McCullough, the Marx Brothers, Laurel & Hardy, Wheeler & Woolsey, the 3 Stooges, the Ritz Brothers, Abbott & Costello, Brown & Carney, Martin & Lewis, Noonan & Marshall and even Rowan & Martin have labored diligently in earning their bread by making us laugh. (There were many others, of course.) BUT this would certainly beg the question as to whether or not that a super-spectacular, double length feature could be created using Comic Actors, Comedians and other Assorted Funnyman Types and thus totally immerse the viewers in comic and outright farcical situations as to give the World a Super-Laugh to end all Laughs!.THE Answer is: Not Really.THIS is not to say that we didn't enjoy this or any other of this Comedy Spectaculars. We did. But there seems to be a sort of ""law of diminishing returns"" that applies here. Ergo, the Laugh Volume doesn't keep pace with the high increase of talent, money, length and promotion.IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD MAD WORLD (Casey Productions/United Artists, 1963) will ever serve as a curio of a film; albeit one that should be seen , at least once. It serves as an example of a progenitor of a sort of Sub-Genre of Comedy Film. The All-Star Super Spectacular; of which there were many to follow. Blake Edwards' THE GREAT RACE (Warner Brothers, 1965) THOSE MAGNICICENT MEN IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES (20th Century-Fox, 1965) and the multi-director James Bond Super Spy Spoof, CASINO ROYALE (Famous Artists Productions/Columbia Pictures Corporation, 1967) are all fine examples of the film type.AS far as giving MAD WORLD any bouquets, it's deserving of a few. First of all, there is an excellent use of a very basic plot; that being the old ""throwing away a lifetime's of hard work and living right living on the temptations of fast, illicit Ca$h. Everything is built on this.SECONDLY, Director, Mr. Stanley Kramer did a fine job of getting the most from some (not all of the multi-talented cast members. The first is with having the great dramatic actor, Mr. Spencer Tracy cast as the aged, ready to retire Police Detective Lieutenant; tempted to literally ""take the money and run!"" The second is in the use of Jerry Lewis in a very brief Cameo; which is surely as funny as anything that he's ever done.TO sum it up, ""WE SORTA LIKED IT, BUT DIDN'T LOVE IT!""

M4W is the ultimate comedy of greed.Perhaps if Eric von Stroheim had had a sense of humour he would have made it.As it is,Stanley Kramer,himself hardly known as a barrel of laughs,was left to surprise admirers and detractors alike by producing a movie that was very long,very loud and very funny.Helped no end by a procession of the best comics of stage screen and radio,Mr Kramer micro - managed the whole production so that even the smallest parts were perfectly cast and brilliantly played.

That said, there's a lot to enjoy, either as a kid or as an adult: Ethel Merman's Oscar-worthy turn as Milton Berle's shrew of a mother-in-law; Peter Falk's hyperactive cabdriver; the Jonathan Winters-Arnold Stang-Marvin Kaplan gas station fight; any scene with the inimitable Dick Shawn! The director, Stanley Kramer, wisely handles the whole film -- in which a group of seemingly normal people are turned into greedy maniacs as they hunt through southern California for $300,000 in stolen loot --- as if he's making one of his socially conscious epics. The widescreen is well-used. What isn't so well-handled is the gaggle of guest stars...some, like Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny and Don Knotts are fun, while others such as The Three Stooges, Edward Everett Horton and Stan Freberg barely register, and why Kramer would recruit Buster Keaton for such a brief scene is a mystery. The principals, including Spencer Tracy as the one seemingly sane character are all in top form and comics like Berle, Shawn, Winters, Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers and Buddy Hackett -- none of whom had sustainable movie careers --- are well showcased. Terry-Thomas, Edie Adams, Dorothy Provine, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson and William Demarest are in it too.

48,barnabyrudge,"Epic scale comedy, intended as the comedy-to-end-all-comedies (which it isn't).",6,20 May 2005,"Stanley Kramer - the producer and director of this colossal comedy epic - admitted afterwards that his objective when making this film was to serve up the comedy to end all comedies. It's a seriously over-ambitious goal, and in all honesty the film never comes within touching distance of achieving it. However, there's still a good deal to enjoy. Energetic performances from an all-star cast; splendid stunt work; occasional moments of comic ingenuity; destruction on a mind-boggling scale; and lots of guest appearances from major stars to keep you engaged during the periodic lulls. The reason the film loses some of its appeal is that, in my view, there are two noteworthy flaws. The first is that the film is much, much longer than it really ought to be; the second is that noise and destruction are substituted for wit at EVERY imaginable opportunity. Sometimes, a witty remark or an underplayed expression can be twice as funny as someone demolishing a building. As the saying states, ""less can be more"", which seems an alien notion in Kramer's larger-than-life approach to things.A bunch of tourists driving along a Californian highway witness a dramatic accident. A car careers off the road and plunges down a mountain-side. The tourists go down to check out the wreckage, and discover the almost dead driver Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) lying nearby. He tells them about a robbery he pulled many years earlier, and inform them that the $350,000 loot is buried in a park in the distant city of Santa Rosita, under ""a big W"". After unsuccessfully trying to debate a way of evenly splitting the money, the tourists decide that there's no alternative but to challenge each other to a ""winner-takes-all"" race to the cash. Unbeknown to the participants, the entire race is being covertly observed by the police, led by Captain Culpepper (Spencer Tracy), who hope to let the treasure-seekers dig up the long lost stolen fortune for them.The whole cast are in pretty dynamic form, most notably Tracy as the honest but highly stressed cop with deception on his mind; Ethel Merman as the most intentionally annoying character in movie history; and Dick Shawn (in the film's best comic performance) as a psychotic life-guard whose love for his momma knows no bounds. Great scenes include Shawn's frenzied attempt to pursue by car his brother-in-law and an English fortune-hunter; the hardware store antics of the Crumps (Sid Caesar and Edie Adams) as they try to escape from a locked cellar; and Phil Silvers' hilarious humiliation at the hands of a young farm-boy. There are certainly a share of ineffective sequences, especially the final scene on the fireman's' ladder, which is ludicrously OTT and hindered by unforgivably obvious dummy shots. Also, as already hinted at, the film considerably outstays its welcome so that by the end one comes away feeling a sense of exhaustion rather than elation.

49,davispittman,Absolute classic,10,13 September 2017,"This was one of my absolute favorite movies as a child. It's both one of the longest and craziest movies I've ever seen. It focuses on several car loads of people driving down a mountainous road, when a car comes racing by doing about 90 and launches right off a cliff. Some of the people from the cars go down to help the injured man who was driving the car, he informs them with his dying breathe that there's millions of dollars buried under a big W out in California. They all talk amongst themselves later on after he's died about the supposed fortune and how they'll divide it up. But the problem is that they can't please everyone, so they just decide to have it as everyone for himself and they race to see who can get there first. The big thing in this movie is the cast. The cast is chock full of big famous stars from that time. They all fit their roles well and play them exceptionally well. I can't go through every single actor because there are simply too many of them. But I will say that my personal favorite member of the cast is Ethel Merman, and that's because she played her role with enthusiasm, sharp wit, and hits every humorous line with just the right amount of craziness, her character alone makes up half the comedy in my opinion. The movie also uses slapstick if that's your kind of comedy. The writing is full of good humor, it's not all crazy stunts, even though there's certainly no shortage of that. 10/10.

50,JoeKarlosi,"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) ***1/2",8,11 June 2014,"Often and arguably considered ""The Greatest Comedy Ever Made"", this Stanley Kramer Epic is certainly the biggest. It's a wild and zany free-for-all which runs nearly three hours and boasts the talents of many of the funniest comic actors of the time. It all begins when elderly robber Jimmy Durante crashes his speeding car off the road, and several other motorists stop and reach out to help him. Just before dying, the old man tells them they're entitled to take the $350,000 loot he's stashed in a national park, buried for years ""underneath a Big W"". At first the eight people at the crash site try to compromise, but ultimately all hell erupts in a greedy ""every man and woman for themselves"" frenzy. This sets the crazy pace for several different humorous vignettes, as the participants all race to the park to be the first to get the stolen money: Jonathan Winters is a big lug of a truck driver who gets into a disastrous altercation with two nerdy gas station attendants (Arnold Stang & Marvin Kaplan). Milton Berle is a suffering dweeb of a husband who's controlled by his wife (Dorothy Provine) and his loud-mouthed mother in law (Ethel Merman, perfect here in a suitably irritating comic performance). Dick Shawn is Merman's dimwitted playboy bum of a son. Sid Caesar and Edie Adams are a couple who get locked in a hardware store but can't seem to get out. Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett are two pals forced to fly their own airplane when drunken pilot Jim Backus knocks himself out (Carl Reiner is the air traffic controller). Along the way, other opportunists worm themselves into the chase: Phil Silvers is a gem as a real sleazy snake with eyeglasses and no scruples. Terry-Thomas is a proud Englishman in constant patriotic conflicts with American Milton Berle. Peter Falk and Eddie Anderson are two clueless cab drivers. And observing all of these clashing characters is straight man Spencer Tracy, in the role of the aging Police Captain Culpepper, who has been tracking this case of the stolen money for fifteen years, and is now looking to find a way to retire himself off to Mexico.On and on the mania goes, with some fun car chases and many gags, some of which work better than others. There are so many other comedians given tiny guest spots here and there, that it's hard to remember them all... but keep on the lookout for cameos by: Don Knotts (as a nervous motorist), Jack Benny, Leo Gorcey, Jerry Lewis, Joe E. Brown, Buster Keaton, and even The Three Stooges. It's not a perfect film, nor in my opinion is it the most drop-dead funniest comedy ever, but I have to love its sheer sense of size, scope, and all-out craziness.

51,slokes,Every Man And Merman For Himself,7,6 June 2009,"A hot morning on an isolated stretch of California desert road is interrupted by the crash of a speeding car. Five motorists stop to help (this is in 1963) and the dying driver tells them of a vast sum of riches, $350,000 (again, 1963), buried under ""a big W"". After he literally kicks the bucket, the motorists' budding partnership to fortune falls apart as greed and suspicion set in.Stanley Kramer was known as a maker of serious social films about problems like racism and religious persecution. ""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" was his foray into comedy, though one dealing with the problem of greed. Money was a problem for the film, too. Made as a ""comedy spectacular"" over three hours in length, ""Mad4"" only just earned back its high cost. Kramer later sighed the film ""just had too much of everything"". Ironically, it stands today as his most popularly remembered film.I definitely see Kramer's point. ""Mad4"" is overloaded with everything: stars; stunts; setpieces; hairpieces; slow burns; gurns; twists and turns; one-liners; wisecracks; pratfalls, insult humor; and a walking, talking mother-in-law joke in the form of formidable Ethel Merman. There's little subtlety to the humor, and no heart. Everyone suffers miserably in pursuit of the money, deservedly or not.Does everyone have their own favorite character, who they root for? It's J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle) for me. He's stuck with both Merman as mother-in-law and crazy Sylvester (Dick Shawn) for a brother-in-law. He does have a couple of things going for him, a jaunty captain's cap and a pleasant British traveling companion Col. Hawthorne (Terry-Thomas), though things sour between them when Hawthorne comments on the ""totally emasculated"" American male, of which Finch is a prime example.""They die like flies from coronary thrombosis while their women sit under hair dryers eating chocolates and arranging for every second Tuesday to be some sort of Mother's Day,"" Hawthorne notes. ""And this positively preposterous preoccupation with bosoms...""The comedy is not always this sharp, however. More often, ""Mad4"" substitutes comedy with shots of people in crazy, dangerous situations screaming or crying, sometimes both at once. The film succeeds as much as it does from piling on talent: No sooner do the first group of comedians begin overstaying their welcome than they meet up with other, fresher characters, including Shawn, Terry-Thomas, and Phil Silvers as a delightfully snakey lowlife, one of the few characters in the story who genuinely deserves his miserable fate.""Mad4"" may celebrate film comedy, but most of its key actors earned lasting fame either on TV (Berle, Silvers, Sid Caesar) or on stage (Merman, Shawn, Jonathan Winters, Buddy Hackett). The only genuine comedy film legends here are Jerry Lewis and Buster Keaton, who have one line and 20 seconds on screen between them. But its great especially seeing Berle, Merman, Silvers, and Winters shining on screen, given the paucity of film roles in their otherwise sterling careers. Shawn is good, too, though I enjoyed his performance more when I was 15.Maybe the film's biggest miscalculation, other than going as long as it does, is casting Spencer Tracy as Chief Culpepper, who watches the proceedings with wry, tired bemusement. He doesn't seem to be in the same film as anyone else, even when he's on the scene with the others at the end. I admit I'm not a Tracy fan, but even Katharine Hepburn couldn't have seen much to enjoy here.Great stunts, though, and some genuine laughs make this fun to watch, even when it does drag.

And second off the cast list is stunning, studded with known actors and comics in cameos throughout the movie. And I gather it was a success when released.However, success doesn't always stand the test of time, and this proves that some comedy has an expiration date. The main problem isn't that the jokes and puns aren't funny. Neither is the idea or story bad. But they don't know when to quit. Many scenes and jokes are stretched out far too long, the jokes get repetitive and loses their edge. Simply put, it stops being funny.And when most of the jokes are about someone falling, crashing or tumbling over, that too becomes too repetitive. There's no development, just a change of scenery. I suppose some of the fun is supposed to be a few characters with loud and quick mouths rambling about. But to me they're more obnoxious than funny.The main reason to watch it now is to go star-spotting, but that doesn't really motivate watching for two hours and a half 5/10",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

55,triple8,Personifies everything I hate in movies yet oh how I laughed.,8,31 December 2004,"Well-so far I haven't read one good review of this movie on here. I don't have a lot to add except growing up, this was one of my favorite comedies. This is totally slapstick, lots of chases and things breaking-silly and almost plot less-but oh how I laughed. I'm not quite sure WHY I did but I have never been able to view this movie without breaking out into Gales of laughter. Since I'm writing a review, I'd like to try to give a specific reason Why this off the wall, completely silly movie appealed to me so much but I can't because there is no reason. This movie is ridiculous in it's way, but it knows it, and doesn't Take itself at all seriously. It's like Seinfeld-a movie about nothing.(Except Chases, things falling, breaking etc). That's it. But It's funny. It's mindless and it's entertaining and I loved it! Since, I haven't seen it in quite awhile, maybe I wouldn't love it now and I can see how it wouldn't be for everybody but all I know is this is one of the few comedies that rendered me absolutely hysterical through most of it and I'm not the only person who had that reaction. This is coming from someone who isn't particularly fond of slapstick. There's not much else to say about it-it's certainly a mad, mad movie and one that gave me numerous laughs many a time.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

57,onepotato2,pretty damned awful,1,8 October 2007,"When I was a kid I was intoxicated by this movies recipe for comedy which is 10 parts cast, 25 parts shtick, 70 parts annoyance, 100 parts volume, 200 parts length, 1000 parts Murphy's law and 10,000 parts human idiocy. Mmmm delicious! As an adult it's a noxious, unpalatable brew. I'd be fully prepared to give it some credit if it coaxed even a titter out of me. I guess you could show it to your kids, with a stern warning that if they still enjoy it past the age of 20, you'll disown them.You like this movie? Congratulations you have the life Voltaire warned us against. And this is coming from somebody who likes Caddyshack. Perhaps you misjudged it as a quality effort due to the all star cast. I would rather drink the water in Mexico than sit through this again. This movie is wholly without merit.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
58,Galina_movie_fan,Mad x 4 World = BIG W = WONDERFUL. Simply priceless.,10,5 February 2009,"Made over 40 years ago, twice as long as any comedy should be, it is a non-stop, mad fun, and a very beautiful and well crafted movie to that, the true achievement by Mr. Stanley Kramer. Did I mention the feast of stunts? As stunt coordinator Carey Loftin claims, ""You name a stunt, we did it - in airplanes, automobiles, tractors, trucks, fire engines"". It never slows down. It was funny 40 years ago when I saw it in the theater in Moscow with my friend, and we , two teenage girls laughed so much that we could not breathe. It is still funny. What a great monument to the American famous comedians who gathered in the movie. I've always been a subscriber to the opinion that the best comedies are short, swift, and fast. As the saying goes, dying is easy, comedy is hard. One can only wonder how hard it was to make a Colossus of the comedy 195 minutes long, to gather dozens of the best and most famous comedians of their time, and to give them all the moments to shine. What did it take to send them all in the mad, mad, mad, mad race for the buried treasure that require them to drive, to fly, to swim, to run, to crawl, to fight, to cheat, and to fall hard from fire escapes, ladders, palm trees, and building tops under the watchful eye of the police chief Spencer Tracy (famous dramatic actor happened to be very funny, too) on his retirement day, and to have as the result the film that never hangs or runs out of breath - now this is a BIG W - WONDERFUL. Every actor/actress in a big role or the small cameo deserves praise and admiration, and it is simply impossible to even try to mention them all but for me it was Ethel Merman, the loud, obnoxious , pushy mother-in-law from hell who stole the show. As for the small cameos, uncredited Jerry Lewis with the idiotically happy look at his face driving over Tracy's hat in the beginning of the film and Peter Falk as the easily irritated cab driver in the end make me laugh as I am writing it. Well, whom am I kidding? Everyone was funny and everything was memorable in the mad, loud, huge, great - one and only Mad x 4 World",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
59,winner55,greed and depravity,1,29 September 2007,"I only saw this twice in my life (my mother insisted on it, both times), the last time 30 years ago, and I still have a sour taste in my mouth.Take practically every living comic who made a movie between 1910 and 1950 and completely throw their talents away on cameos and one-liners (on the obviously self-indulgent whim that 'we're oh-so-much-more-sophisticated-now').Take a whole host of post-'50s B-movie character actors television comics and have them draw out every damn line and bit of physical comedy, until all possible laughter is lost in the bewildered effort to guess whether they'll ever stop.Dump in a whole ton of car chases, train chases, bicycle races, plane chases, along with the inevitable crashes of every description.Make sure your script is written by nihilistic cynics who think human beings are the lowest form of life on the planet, and comedy the lowest form of entertainment they ever came up with.As garnish add Spencer Tracy, who really does look like he's dying throughout the film.And voilà! - ""Mad Mad (etc.) World"", a joyless, tiresome spectacle of greed and depravity - Hollywood having nothing better to do than spend hundreds of thousands of dollars excreting on itself.The good news?

( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10,10,7 February 2020,"A remarkable comedy masterpiece with many of the greatest names in Hollywood of all time all packed into one coked up, mish-mash of an epic that never loses steam and never falls apart. Stanley Kramer, a man not known for comedy, directed this film with a real, tangible commitment to making it the most zany and crazy comedy epic of all time. It has everyone from Sid Caeser to Mickey Rooney; Buster Keaton to Ethel Merman, and even briefly the Three Stooges. This film couldn't possibly happen in a Hollywood landscape like the one that exists today. It's a reflection of a time when comedians came together in the name of comedy, for the sake of helping people forget all of their problems for a couple hours.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
61,MartianOctocretr5,"""It's the Big W, I tell ya, it's the Big W!""",10,27 June 2010,"From the wonderful ""3-Ring-Circus"" themed opening title tune to the final pratfall, this is one of my all time favorite flicks. I've revisited it many times, and it's always a great watch.It's one of those '60's movies where as many big stars as could be found were dealt into the melee of the film's running time. This was the film's principal claim to fame (and utilizes the formula better than any other): a battalion of comedic stars (including walk-on's and cameos), stellar names as diverse as Buster Keaton and Jerry Lewis. Not only was it a showcase to identify the faces sharing screen time, but it was also a high-aiming comedy embracing all that's classic in the realm of slapstick and parody. The film's title is fulfilled with characters going in pursuit of treasure, and winding up in a maze bizarre results. It's the classic mix of comedy and tragedy; and all the while, innocent bystanders turn out to be cleverly placed cameos.What drives everyone ""mad"" is greed. When a group of ordinary travelers learn about a bounty of buried treasure (hidden under a ""Big W""), they resort to all manners of insanity to get their hands on it before anyone else does. What follows is a wild race with a talented cast that takes you on the ride with them. Look out; other drivers! Pick your favorite to get the dough. I rooted for the truck driver, Pike. By the way, who were those three firemen at the airport? Those guys sure looked familiar....",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
62,FlushingCaps,"So many stars, so many laughs",10,3 March 2019,"We begin this film with a comedic cartoon credit pictures featuring ""the world"" with all sorts of silliness involving the cast of characters, with names being switched around, as though hands of each character reaches out from the earth and rearranges the list so their own name is on top, and such, then the real movie begins with aerial views of a highway in a mountainous, desert region of the country, where one car is seen wildly passing several vehicles before it crashes through a barrier and tumbles down the mountainside before flipping over. Four of the vehicles the car passed pull over and five of the eight occupants-the five men-all climb down the hill to see if they can help. Before they even begin to climb down the laughter begins for me, as Milton Berle's character describes the car ""sailing"" right over the edge of the roadway. He uses the ""sailing"" term at least three times, in a way that generates the first of what must be 200 or more laughs from me, no matter how many times I view this movie.They find an old man lying on the ground, near death. It's Jimmy Durante, who tells about this ""Big W"" where beneath it in a southern California state park is buried $350,000, and he's giving it to these strangers because he knows he's about to die. As he closes his eyes, the others start talking about what to do. Suddenly he loudly starts talking again for another sentence or two, then he kicks the bucket-literally, knocking a bucket farther down the mountainside with his foot.Cops arrive and the before they climb down, the five agree not to say a word to them about the treasure they just learned about. The cop asks if, before the guy died, if he said anything. One of them replies, ""About what?""Now this all happens within five minutes of the start of the movie yet one reviewer said there wasn't anything at all funny in the first 70 minutes of the show. Maybe they were out getting popcorn for most of that time. Someone else wrote that the first 15 minutes were ""among the best and funniest in picture history."" I'd say they are closer to correct.Well, these people all climb back up the hill, leaving the police to handle the dead man and start resuming their trips, but within minutes they have all stopped to discuss the matter. They sort of agree to join in together and split the money if they find it, but they can't agree on how to split it evenly. Eight people were there, but only five went down the hill. There are four vehicles. Sid Caesar's character comes up with a scheme to count all of this, dividing the money into 25 shares. Jonathan Winters' character, for example, gets one share for being a person, one for going down the hill, one for his truck, and another share for being a person in the truck. But the shrill mother-in-law, Ethel Merman, of Milton Berle's character, keeps yelling at everyone so much that they decide to just turn it into a race to get to the money with no sharing.This begins the wild race along the roads, complete with more slapstick than any five Three Stooges films put together (they make a most-brief appearance later on, one that drew laughter AND applause without the Stooges doing nothing but stand still) and more comedic actors appearing than you've ever seen in any other single film.Captain Culpepper of the Santa Rosita Police Department, played by Spencer Tracy is the star of this film as much as anyone. He has officers all over the southern part of California tracking the exploits of everyone.The four vehicles that began the race all get stopped, one way or another, and the gang has to resort to stealing other vehicles, hiring airplanes-including a 1916 relic-and hitching rides to continue their quest. The couple that gets to town first, enter a hardware store to obtain a pick axe and a shovel, but they get accidentally locked inside the basement for a long time, unable to escape, letting others catch up to them.My favorite line comes from Jesse White (the old Maytag repairman and guest on almost every 1960s TV comedy show ever made) who is a control tower person at an airport where Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett's characters wind up trying to land a private airplane, being talked down on the radio by Paul Ford (Sergeant Bilko's Colonel Hall). Because Ford has so much trouble communicating effectively, and the plane zooms by the tower a couple of times almost crashing into it, White somberly says, ""Why don't we just shoot 'em down and be through with it?""To critics who complain that there's too much slapstick, I will point out that there are a plethora of great lines, many of which are only funny in the context, so I won't try to list them all. Some short scenes are funny because of who is involved, such as Jack Benny stopping his car to try to help people, being rudely told to go away by Ethel Merman, leading to a long pause before Benny says his trademark, ""Well."" Phil Silvers steals some scenes with a character who is just like his Sergeant Bilko.Every scene has one or more characters either running into a problem slowing them down, or making progress toward the treasure spot. I don't understand the criticism of it being too long-do Harry Potter fans complain of the books being too long? If it's an enjoyable ride-the longer the better. I have seen many TV series episodes that were perhaps 18 minutes too long-even when they only ran 21 minutes. That's because they weren't funny. When I'm laughing every few seconds, the movie length is not a problem. I can think of three films I think were funnier, but only three: in chronological order-W.C. Fields ""It's a Gift,"" Peter Falk's ""The In-Laws"" and Leslie Nielsen's ""The Naked Gun.""",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
63,sme_no_densetsu,An epic comedy? Why not!,7,19 June 2010,"Stanley Kramer's ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" was something of an attempt to create the ultimate comedy. It came at a time when Hollywood was trying to outdo television with ever larger 'epic' films. Accordingly, ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" is stuffed to the brim with more comedic actors than you can shake a stick at.The movie centres on a group of people who are privy to a dying thief's last words which concern the location of his stash of stolen money. When the folks involved can't settle on a means of splitting the cash (should they find it) they take an 'every man for himself' approach. From then on they set out frantically in search of treasure, unaware that the cops have them under close surveillance.The cast is chock full of comedic talent in lead, support & cameo roles. Making significant contributions are actors like Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, Mickey Rooney, Jonathan Winters, Ethel Merman, Phil Silvers, Dick Shawn and others. I'm not nearly knowledgeable enough to have noted all of the cameo appearances but it was nice to see the likes of Jimmy Durante, Norman Fell, Jim Backus and Don Knotts.In technical terms, the film is well executed. Kramer's direction is capable and the Oscar-nominated cinematography is attractive. Even in the recut 154 minute general release version the editing is well done, keeping the film's various threads going at full speed. The Oscar-nominated score by Ernest Gold also deserves praise, as do the Saul Bass designed titles.Ultimately, though, the film falls short of its aim as the ultimate comedy. One of the story lines stagnates and the finale is ridiculously over the top, not to mention hurt by some less than convincing special effects. Even if the original 192 minute roadshow version still existed it would probably have the same problems (if not more). Don't get me wrong, though; there's enough to like about the film to make for a worthwhile viewing, just don't expect anything close to the greatest comedy of all time.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
64,Jeremy_Urquhart,If Ben-Hur were a slapstick comedy...,9,10 February 2020,"Hyperbolic headline I know, but I stand by it 100%. This movie is fantastic and a near-masterpiece, and to my knowledge, there is nothing else quite like it. When Hollywood was making epic films, they focused on serious, often historical and/or tragic stories, for maximum emotion, scope, and mass audience appeal. Stanley Kramer made something not too dissimilar with the very good Judgment At Nuremburg, which was close to an epic in terms of its cast size, running time, and historical focus. Then he made It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World, which has a large budget, huge cast, massive scope, and a general sense of pushing everything to the absolute max. Even the title makes this attitude apparent- it was strangely tiring to even type 'Mad' four times in a row.It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World has a simple premise that technically doesn't need over two and a half hours to effectively explore. Perhaps I can understand the criticisms in this regard, because what we have is a simple story of a fortune being hidden somewhere, and a group of people competing to get their hands on it. And so often, broad, slapstick comedies tend to be on the shorter side, as they run the risk of wearing out their audience through continued violence, silly humour, and general chaos and shenanigans. For these reasons, I understand this film not appealing to everybody. However, if you do really love a smart dumb comedy, and are willing to stick with one for the amount of time you'd expect to spend on a far more serious epic, then I can highly recommend this one.I've always been drawn to this kind of humour, especially when done well (and here, I think it truly is). Perhaps it appeals to the child in me, but car chases, destruction, over-the-top fights, idiotic characters, escalating circumstances running hilariously out of control, and petty arguments among those aforementioned stupid characters are all things I find very amusing. And once the plot of It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World starts, it really doesn't let up, with the film continually finding new, outrageous, and wholly satisfying ways to keep topping itself in terms of madness and laughs. And the large cast of characters stuck in a large variety of situations means that whenever one storyline runs the risk of starting to get tiresome, the film can simply switch perspectives and check in on another storyline. The pacing in this regard is actually extremely good, and moves quickly even by current film standards. There is just so much action and comedy and impressive stunts that yes, it could indeed be overwhelming. For me, however, it wasn't, and once it really got underway after about 15-20 minutes of set-up, I was on board and hooked.It's worth watching for the novelty. An epic slapstick comedy isn't something you get everyday. Sure, the old Buster Keaton films scratch a similar itch, and as precursors to this film are also worth checking out. And its influence can also be found in other destructively fun and excessive comedies like The Blues Brothers (another personal favourite of mine), but It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World still stands out regardless. It's a perfect sort of lazy Sunday afternoon movie, being entertaining, well-made, a lot of fun, and filled with impressive actions, stunts, and talented comedians from Hollywood's Golden Age (so many cameos too!) I can give this a strong recommendation to anyone who thinks it sounds interesting. It's likely not for everyone, but if this kind of humour and maximal filmmaking appeals to your sensibilities, it's likely you'll find it a classic like I do.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
65,classicalsteve,Only for Hardcore Vaudville Fans: Vaudville's Last Gasp is Almost Unwatchable -- More Like a Whimper than a Cry: When is this going to be over?,3,7 November 2008,"A few decades ago, this kind of over-the-top mad-cap comedy was very much in vogue, although the material ""tries to be funny"" sort of like a a bad Vaudeville act. Produced in the wake of ""The Caesar Hour"" and ""Your Show of Shows"", ""Mad World"" spawns from a comedic style born on Vaudeville and lived on briefly through television and movies via Milton Berle, Mel Brooks, Bob Hope, Jonathan Winters, Harvey Corman, Tim Conway, Sid Caesar, Carol Burnett and many others. The ""comedy caper"" sub-genre enjoyed a brief stint from the 1960's into the 1980's, ending with the ""Cannon Ball Run"" movies. Today, however, contrived comedy of this sort wears thin and has not withstood very well. ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" was probably the beginning and end of comedy-caper with a Vaudveillian cast (and you can see why), and the comedy-variety TV show ended when the Carol Burnett Show aired for the last time in the 1970's.The formula is almost too contrived for its own good. A diverse group of misfit characters, usually played by Hollywood comedic name talent shown in little boxes on the poster, find out about some booty. They all go on a mad-cap chase and/or adventure to grab the booty before the others do. And this movie is brimming with so many recognizable names, it's starts sounding like a Who's Who of Trivial Pursuit Comedy Edition: Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Sid Caesar, Jim Bachus, Jonathan Winters, Mickey Rooney, Phil Silvers, and scores of others. Even more have uncredited cameos like Jack Benny, Carl Reiner and Jerry Lewis. And of course the characters are little caricatures. Jonathan Winters plays a truck driver not playing with a full deck. Milton Berle is supposed to be a successful businessman who would rather be on his yacht. And Ethel Merman plays his never-ending nagging wife who gets the nickname ""old bag"", and deservedly so. At one point I just started fast-forwarding her dialog! Spencer Tracy plays a cop who is tracking the party of misfits, and he often throws his hat out of the window, as if that's funny. It get's run over by Jerry Lewis, in probably his most outstanding screen performance since it's the only scene he's in.This merry band of idiots that would make the Adams Family look like Oxford Professors comes upon a dying man (Jimmy Durante) who just crashed over the side of the road. Why an 80-year-old man was going 150 miles an hour through mountainous terrain in an American car is almost as big a mystery as to why the acting is so bad. He reveals that there is $350,000 stashed underneath a ""W"", which we assume is not the middle initial of a certain bad president. Of course, he doesn't ask them to give a message to any loved ones, or to get an ambulance. When he croaks, the cops come, and the group can't decide if Durante died immediately or if was a raving lunatic. It becomes clear that these marginal human beings, played by actors who probably made many times the amount of the booty, are out to get their share of the loot.The problem with this kind of caper comedy is that it ""tries to be funny"", akin to a Vaudeville act where two dingbats try to outdo each other with top hat and cane all the while falling over one another to the accompaniment of cymbals crashing. I've seen 12-year-olds make up stuff that's far more amusing. If you like the rather silly Vaudevillan humor that adorned the stages of theaters back in the early 20th century, Mad Mad World is a throw-back to that era. However, for younger audiences who need comedy with more of a modern edge, like Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Robin Williams, or Steve Martin, Mad Mad World seems like a mishmash of unintelligent ridiculousness. Sure, Mad World is designed as pure entertainment, but at 155 minutes, it gets to be torturous. I thought cruel and unusual punishment had been outlawed by the US Constitution.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
66,Karl Self,Bigger isn't automatically better,5,10 October 2008,"It's A Mad ... World was made when cinema suffered under the impact of television, and was hard pressed to woo its audience back. Out came bigger-than-natural movies like this one, which is longer and has more famous comedians and outrageous stunts in it than anything before (or after). In its original run it was also shown in a supersized format that resembles modern-day IMAX. You get the picture. It is pretty spectacular. Unfortunately, especially on the small screen, it isn't all that great, either. I guess it just has to be seen as it was originally released.The best I can say for IAMMMMW is that it obviously was one of the inspirations for The Blues Brothers, a movie which equally tries to supersize at least some of its scenes (the car chase through the mall, or the final car chase), but also offers a great story, and depends on a few great actors rather than everyone in the Greater LA phone book. The problem with IAMMMMW, then, is that it relies too much on effects and size and doesn't offer enough in terms of plot and development. And I guess it just wasn't meant to be seen on a crusty TV set. As it is, the plot just doesn't holds less water than an old man on diuretics, and the comedy is too repetitive and stale (unless you're really into jokes about mothers-in-law, drunk pilots and slipping on banana peels).It's still worth checking out on a slow evening, but I didn't enjoy it all that much.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
67,Beta_Gallinger,"A very long comedy adventure, but one with many comic highlights",8,14 August 2009,"Over two years ago, I saw ""Rat Race"", from 2001, which was how I first heard of ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", when I learned that the more recent film of the two was loosely a remake of this 1963 comedy adventure. I thought the 2001 movie was pretty funny, but then learned that it was generally considered inferior to this original film, so I figured I'd better check this one out. It's been a while since then, but just the other day, I finally managed to rent this first film of the two. Beforehand, I didn't know how long it was, and was a little surprised when I learned about the runtime before watching it. However, despite the fact that it's about three hours long (or just a little less), and I can't give it a 10 like many other viewers, I found myself laughing so many times! In the California desert, a car speeds along the road, and soon falls off a cliff! This accident is witnessed by people in four other vehicles nearby, and five men (Dingy Bell Benjy Benjamin, J. Russell Finch, Lennie Pike, and Melville Crump) all go down to help the driver, Smiler Grogan. As he lies dying on the ground, Grogan tells them about the $350,000 he has hidden in Santa Rosita State Park, under a giant ""W""! The drivers and passengers of the four vehicles try to reach an agreement on how the fortune should be shared, but do not succeed, and their greed sends them on a race to their destination. Along the way, each party is headed for a crazy adventure, filled with conflict and mayhem! They encounter other people on their journey, which only leads to more trouble! Meanwhile, Capt. C. G. Culpepper of the Santa Rosita Police Department knows this all started with criminal Smiler Grogan, so he has the racers tracked! Much of the humour in this film is very verbal, with a lot of arguing, and this definitely made me laugh. Later in the film, we get into more physical humour, and this is also funny for the most part. Mrs. Marcus, played by Ethel Merman, is the harridan mother-in-law of J. Russell Finch. Some viewers may find her annoying, but I definitely found her funny. There are so many other comic highlights in the film, involving the feud between Lennie Pike and Otto Meyer (a goof-ball he meets on the road), which leads to a lot of comical mayhem, two of the other racers stuck above the ground in a plane which they don't know how to fly, Mrs. Marcus trying to communicate with her beatnik son, two of the racers trapped in a hardware store basement and trying to escape, Culpepper talking to his wife and daughter on the phone, etc. The characters get into so many bizarre situations in the film, which is a major reason why it's so funny! Even though I laughed a lot, I do have some minor complaints about this 1963 film. It's perhaps a little TOO long for a movie like this, some scenes end too soon (I saw the DVD version, which is apparently an edited version, so I don't know if this was the case on the big screen back in 1963, over two decades before I was born), and comedian Jerry Lewis makes a cheesy cameo appearance as the man who runs over the hat on the road. If Lewis had played a major part in this movie, he could have really brought it down, but fortunately, it IS only a cameo appearance, so it's nothing to get worked up over. Apart from those flaws, there really isn't much to complain about. I can't jump on the ""best comedy of all time"" bandwagon, but overall, ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" is a memorably funny comedy adventure with a steady ensemble cast.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
68,gftbiloxi,"Uneven But Often Hilarious ""Epic"" Slapstick Comedy",8,2 October 2005,"When an ex-con crashes his car, he reveals a clue to the location of stolen money to bystanders before he dies, and thereby touches off an increasingly competitive race between--are you ready for this?--Milton Berle, Sid Ceasar, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Phil Silvers, Terry-Thomas, Jonathan Winters, Edie Adams, and Dorothy Provine.Within minutes the competition becomes downright nasty, and before too long our cast of neurotic comics are hurtling toward the money by car, bicycle, biplane, luxury aircraft, and virtually every other form of transportation imaginable, trying to wreck the others' chances and be the first to arrive. Along the way they encounter a host of stellar cameo players ranging from the Three Stooges to Buster Keaton, many of whom--Carl Reiner in particular comes to mind--contribute to the fun.There is a great deal to enjoy in this film, but regrettably the film as a whole never quite seems to know what do with its over abundance of talent. The action inevitably breaks down into comic vignettes, and some work better than others, too often leaving the viewer to wade through leaden moments in search of the memorably funny ones. A particularly weak link in the film is, sadly, the usually marvelous Spenser Tracy in the pivotal role of a detective who tracks the race in hope of recovering the stolen money; visibly frail, his very off-the-cuff performance lacks the power to hold the strands of the story together. Similarly, too often marvelous cameo performers such as Zasu Pitts are reduced to mere faces in the crowd, their only appeal in the flicker of recognition they may elicit from the viewer. And the film's conclusion is, frankly, a bust.Still, Berle, Ceasar, and especially Winters are consistently at the top of their game in this sprawling film, and Ethel Merman at her abrasive best makes one regret Hollywood's underuse of her talents. If you like slapstick (and even if you don't) you're bound to find SOMETHING you like here--and for most viewers the parts you like will be sufficient reason to stay with the film.

69,KnightsofNi11,Ridiculously fun,8,11 July 2011,"I'm not sure I've ever seen a film title more correct and more blatantly honest. It is a mad, mad, mad, mad world indeed and this film was made in 1963, before the world became as mad as it is today. But those were simpler times. Times when the dying words of a jewel thief could spark a mad race to his buried money stash. And that is just what happens in It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. When a group of people witness the fatal car crash of a notorious thief he tells them where he has buried $350,000. This group of argumentative and loud mouthed buffoons fail to come up with a fair way to split the money so the game of every man for himself begins as they all race to the stash, encountering all sorts of wacky characters on the way; wacky characters who want their shot at finding the money as well. I don't remember the last time I had this much whole hearted and innocent fun while watching a movie. It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is an absolute blast.This is an hilarious situational comedy and the situations that occur are so nutty and so over the top that you have to wonder how anyone could have thought them all up for the same movie. Variety is this film's best friend. The characters are all so different and so fun while all the situations they get themselves mixed up in are all different and exciting. Two characters will be stuck in an airplane having no idea how to land it while two other characters are locked in a basement trying to blow their way out with dynamite. The film keeps up the excitement and fun very well. It does start to slow down by the end as things finally start to get a tad repetitive and dull. Of course this was almost inevitable for a film with a two and a half hour runtime. But it was by no means enough to hurt the film and I still loved all of it.This film's greatest success would have to be its characters. The whole cast is such an eccentric and kooky bunch, yet none of them are similar. They all have unique personalities and even different types of humor. Some have lines that are more witty and sly while other characters elicit laughs through physical comedy. But no matter what I was still laughing hysterically at any situation or dialogue the film threw my way. This film is truly hysterical. It possesses a brand of comedy that is in no way outdated and can satisfy any age. It is clean, innocent, and fun. The film never feels the need to be serious and even if it does have some sort of subtle morals they are buried beneath the jokes and the wackiness. This makes It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World a funny yet smart film, and there's a lot to be said about that.It is truly phenomenal how much fun this film is. It is so loaded with energy and that energy transfers perfectly to the viewer, drawing them in and making them enjoy watching the film as much as it is evident that the actors enjoyed making the film. A lot of films will pride themselves on their opening and then begin to flatline towards the middle. But not this film. It starts well and then just gets better and better. The ending gets slow and there was a point where I was sort of ready for the film to end. Regardless, I still enjoyed this film way more than any film of its nature I can think of off the top of my head that I have watched recently. This film reminds me why I enjoy watching movies so much and it reminds me what great filmmaking is all about.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

72,aesgaard41,One Of The Greatest Comedies Of All Time,10,12 May 2001,"If you take all the top comics and comedians at one time and put them together, you'll probably have a riot, although a very funny one. This is one of the greatest movies of all time because it takes some of the most understandable human concepts of greed, selfishness and avarice, and makes us look at ourselves. A fleeing bank robber tells four strangers about some money from a heist he buried just before he dies. Those strangers tell their friends, loved ones, relatives and a few more strangers and before you know it, it's a mad race of lunacy to get to the money first. The movie has a great time finding believable characters to fit its comics, and creating numerous scenes of slapstick humor as we see cameo upon cameo of comedians piling upon one another. It's also not that hard to find parallel characters between one's self and the roles in the movie. I think I would have been a lot like the logical dentist Sid Caeser plays while one of my buddies would have been the Johnathan Winters role. The comparison between the movie and reality just draws you into it that much more until you feel like you're in this progenitor to the Cannonball Run movies. This is the Holy Grail of comedies and there is nothing else that quite comes close to it in sheer lunacy or creativity.

How the script writer and the director managed to coax such mediocre performances out of -- in no particular order -- Phil Silvers, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Milton Berle, Terry-Thomas, Dick Shawn, Jonathan Winters, Ethel Merman and Tracy (with cameos by Jack Benny, Rochester and Joe E. Brown) is a near miracle. They all get plenty of screen time but only Winters is anywhere near the top of his game. Merman is successfully shrill and obnoxious as the mother-in-law of Berle's character but she's meant to wear out her welcome quickly, and she certainly does so. I have to suspect that the script (and the director) left the comedians little or no room to improvise so as to project their own particular style of comedy.

77,Eumenides_0,A Comedy about Greed and Stupidity,8,5 January 2010,"Watching this movie I remembered another screwball comedy: Airplane. In both movies the format is the same: to have as many gags in as little time as possible. Although Airplane will always be my favourite nonsense comedy, It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World has won a special place in my heart for its ability to entertain and delight in every minute of this movie. And it's a long movie. The version I saw has 154 minutes, but I know other versions run many minutes longer. So the screenwriters, the director and the actors deserve a round of applause for never letting the movie become dull for a moment.This movie is like a compendium of comedy: fast-paced talking, slapstick, silent film-like visual gags a la Chaplin or Keaton, fun one-liners, well-timed sequences with punch-lines, this movie has every form of humor ever invented. It also has an amazing cast of characters, ranging from Spencer Tray to Buddy Hackett to Mick Rooney.But in spite of all the nonsense going on, this is not a brainless movie. In fact the premise is quite ingenious and goes deep into human nature. An old robber lies dying in a car accident and tells several witnesses that there is $350,000 hidden in a place. A race of wits ensues between the several witnesses to see who gets there first and claims the money. Throughout the race rivalries come up, alliances are forget and destroyed, people double-cross each other, and everyone will be capable of doing anything to do triumph. In other words, it's one of the most brutal portrayals of human greed and stupidity in cinema. The movie makes it very clear: under the spell of money, people will become ruthless morons capable of anything. Some noir movies, which specialise in this type of story, had never been as unflattering about humanity as this movie is. Because in noir, there's always someone who retains a semblance of morality, as crooked as they may be. But here everyone's corrupted, even the police.Stanley Kramer and screenwriters William and Tanie Rose made a real masterpiece. After 40 years it's still funny, arguably funnier than any modern comedy.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

81,lagudafuad,It's very very very very good,6,6 February 2013,"I like this movie for one thing; it is definite that when you are done watching you will walk away with some scenes glued to your mind. The idiotic dialogue and the way the characters are made to be so greedy that it seemed too out of place that a group of people with such insatiable greed will ever meet. But in ""It's a mad mad mad mad world"", they did meet and these people did everything within their power to make sure that they get to the money first before the other party.Getting an all-round comic cast, with numerous cameos from stars like Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, and others, must have been a mountain climb for producer and director Stanley Kramer, who got the script idea from William Rose, whose initial idea was first based on a bunch of characters in Scotland, but Kramer later pushed for the movie to have an American setting. The movie's name changed from Something a Little Less Serious to Damn Thing After Another and then it was named It's a Mad World gotten from a 1605 comedy Titled A Mad World, My Masters. It was later on during production that the pair (Rose and Kramer) added two more Mads, to the movie title.The movie plot was about a man (who was wanted by the police for robbery) who had a nasty car accident and in his final words told complete strangers who gathered to help that there is $ 350,000 buried ""under a big W"" in Santa Rosita State Park in Santa Rosita Beach. With this information the group at first tried to see if they could share the money equally but after 17 different sharing scenarios and no one agreeing, everyman set off on his own to go claim the money for himself. The main star in the movie is Spencer Tracy who played Captain T. G. Culpeper.The scenes that were glued to my mind in this movie were the scene where Dingy and Benjy were stuck in an airplane, and they had to pilot it because the real pilot was drunk and got knocked out (by leaving the steering stick of the plane to get a drink). The other scene that stood out or got glued to my mind is the scene where couple Melville and Monica got trapped in a hardware store and Melville ended up wrecking the place all in failed attempts to get out.Here is a movie that I can bet you if you do get to watch, you will like and you will come to love the dialogue.

83,gsygsy,it grows on you,7,11 June 2006,"I don't know why I'm so fond of this film. It's not as if its flaws are hard to detect, the main one being that it clearly set out to be a knock-'em-dead comedy and it just isn't. It seems to me that Stanley Kramer didn't really know what he had with the William and Tania Rose script and story. William Rose created THE LADYKILLERS (the original, not the Coen Brothers rehash), and there's a dark tone to that earlier movie which is also in MAD WORLD; a kind of amazement at what people will do for money. It's in that look on Tracy's face as the money is being dug up, as he watches this zany bunch licking their lips in anticipation of the treasure...Kramer went for slapstick rather than darkness. I don't blame him. But he would have made a better movie if he'd followed Alex MacKendrick's example on LADYKILLERS, and made it crazy rather than zany.Having said all that - what this movie has got is its amazing cast. When I first saw it, I was 10 years old, in Cinerama at the London Coliseum. At that time I only really knew of Terry-Thomas (he was English, after all!), Phil Silvers (Bilko had been a big hit in the UK), Dorothy Provine (THE ROARING TWENTIES had also been a great hit) and Tracy (because he was a star much beloved by my parents). By its re-release in the 70s, I knew a little about most of the others - Berle, Rooney, Caesar, Falk - but I knew most about Merman. And it's a primary reason for my love of this movie that it captures Merman in all her glory - and it's the only movie that does, notwithstanding THERE'S NO BUSINESS LIKE SHOW BUSINESS and CALL ME MADAM. MAD WORLD gives Merman the cinematic space she needed for that gigantic theatrical energy.Another element I appreciate now is the juxtaposition of all these wonderful performers. Terry-Thomas and Milton Berle are such an unlikely double-act, but their scenes together are superb, especially their extremely funny patriotic row that precedes their equally funny fight. And then there's the pairing of Jonathan Winters and Phil Silvers - both completely different, both wonderful. Hackett and Rooney are a bit less successful, I think, because Rooney works too hard, but Hackett himself makes up for it. Berle and Merman, Shawn and Merman, Terry-Thomas and Merman, Caesar and Merman - she's brilliant with 'em all. Yeh, it's a one-note performance: but what a note!!!!First I got the soundtrack CD (the music's a lot of fun) and now the DVD, and from time to time I listen and watch, and increasingly, like Tracy at the end, I change from smile to guffaw. It kind of grows on you.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
84,mrb1980,Gargantuan Comedy is Only Mildly Amusing,7,9 November 2012,"Stanley Kramer apparently thought that if he assembled a huge cast of famous comedy players, he would create the funniest movie ever. He was only partially successful. ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" is hilarious in spots, but is otherwise only slightly amusing, despite the presence of many of the top comedy stars of the day.The story is well known by now. Escaped convict Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) crashes his car in the California desert, and several passersby rush to help. Before he dies, Grogan tells the group about a big cache of money buried in California under a mysterious big ""W"". The rest of the film is one frantic dash for the buried cash, under the surveillance of corrupt Capt. Culpeper (Spencer Tracy). The loot is finally dug up, then predictably is accidentally lost during a chaotic final sequence that's more agonizing than funny.The big-name cast is too large to name individually, but Mickey Rooney, Sid Caesar, Jonathan Winters, and Dick Shawn probably do the best jobs. Ethel Merman, Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett, and Phil Silvers are mostly irritating, but their characters were probably written that way. Jim Backus is hilarious as a hung-over small plane pilot. A number of famous folks (including Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny, the Three Stooges, Don Knotts, Norman Fell, many others) appear in brief cameos but their parts are so small they contribute little to the plot. The great Spencer Tracy seems out of place in the middle of all the outrageousness, but is really good anyway.After the initial car crash, this 2½ hour movie overdoes just about everything: endless car chases, Winters destroying a service station by hand, cars careening down hopelessly steep roads, screaming arguments, and airplanes flying at full speed through hangars and billboards. After a while, the non-stop foolishness is so ponderous that you'll be completely worn out. I know I was.Despite the tragedy and sadness of the Kennedy assassination, this film was a big hit in late 1963. You'll probably want to watch this movie—once—to see the once-in-a-lifetime comedy cast, most of whom are now deceased. However, you'll be quickly overwhelmed by the whole thing.

It's just not interesting, not funny and extremely long.The plot is extremely thin (even for a 90 min film): A few guys race each other in order to get to a treasure first. That's it, nothing more.""The Great Race"" - which came only 2 years later and is also very long (2.5 hours, depends on the version you watch) and shot in a wide aspect ratio (2.35:1 compared to this movie which was shot in a 2.76:1 Ultra Panavision) - has developments, interesting characters, different situations happening in different places, it has arcs and new characters; This movie has almost none of those. It's just endless talking and driving in cars, with minor stuff happening here and there. It's just boring.It's not horrible. I've seen worse films, but I can't imagine sitting 3 hours watching something like that. It's ridiculous.

87,Ddey65,Classic epic comedy with too much editing,7,23 May 2002,"Having been born in 1965, it's safe to say that the first time I ever saw ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" was on network television. Every other user comment already reveals enough about the movie, so I'll just stick with my own experiences regarding the film. If you must know, yes I do believe this film is a well-deserved comedy classic, but it's also loaded with breathtaking scenery (natural and contemporary) that's often overlooked by most critics. Many a fan wants to know where that mountain road is. Since I'm also a fan of big cars of the post-WW2 era I can easily spot every one. Mickey Rooney's Volkswagen must be worth a fortune if it's still around. And I don't care if this movie is over 3 hours long. As one commenter put it it has been edited to pieces. I envy those who saw the original 1963 version of this movie, but even they didn't see everything. The versions I've seen include the original television edit, the director's cut on 2 VHS tapes which contain some ""lost scenes"" and people I never even knew were in the movie, the DVD, and even a version on TV where some scenes were shown out of order. The director's cut VHS tapes is the best, partially because of those scenes such as additional police observations, as well as having the sense to keep the original overture, entr'acte, and exit music title cards. Unfortunately, the DVD removes those lost scenes and mixes them with a section of other deleted scenes, like a louder version of Buddy Hackett's ""17 ways of figuring it"" speech, and some riskier ordeals in Santa Rosita Park.I've come to the conclusion that there's only one solution to this problem -- unless all footage is found and re-installed into the original version, the screenplay must be released into a book and sold to the public.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
88,ozthegreatat42330,The Comedy Film All Hollywood Wanted To Be Part Of,10,21 March 2007,"This film contains the greatest gathering of comedic talent in film history.

89,TheHonestCritic,This is one of the most star-studded films in the history of cinema. Does that benefit the movie? Check out my review below to find out!,8,30 August 2020,"""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (1963), one night I was watching TV, and I saw this movie on the guide. I read the title, and thought: ""how many times is the word 'mad' in the title?"" Out of curiosity, I looked into more details and that's when I saw the cast list. When I saw all the actors and actresses listed, my jaw dropped, literally. I didn't watch the film right then and there, at the risk of ruining anything. When I watch a brand new movie for the first time, I prefer watching it from beginning to end. The next morning, I looked up the full cast and it just blew my mind! All of these actors and actresses plus many different cameos as well? Wow! So, that night I rented it from On Demand and then I watched it. I was blown away! It was fantastic, and it kept me hooked from beginning to end! This movie has a perfect story, perfect acting, great sets/locations, and a great soundtrack. The only real drawback in this movie is the special effects. For the most part, they are excellent, especially for back then. But, there are a few that have not aged well. Particularly, the green-screen shots of the characters driving in their cars and especially during the end sequence on the fire truck ladder. Even though practical special effects beat CGI any day, some of the effects look a little bit too cartoony. Now, let's get into the positives for this film. The story is a lot of fun from beginning to end. I was completely invested and laughing all the way through. A few times I laughed so hard that I got tears in my eyes! If a comedy film can succeed in making me laugh that hard, let alone more than once, then you know that you have a winner! One important thing to point out is that the more simple the story in a comedy, the better. With a simple but effective plot, you create more wiggle room for extra humor, jokes and slapstick. Which are major elements that will help your comedy film shine. The basic plot of the film is that there's a briefcase with $350,000 in cash buried in the fictional Santa Rosita State Park in southern California. From there, it's a wild and chaotic race between this group of all-star actors and actresses to find the money first. Another impressive thing about this movie is that it's about 160 minutes in length. At first, I was kind of skeptical about that, because if a comedy movie is too long then it risks the chance of falling flat and becoming redundant. Comedy movies should usually range in the field of 80 minutes to 120 minutes max. However, this film was so well written and paced that you don't even notice how long it is, it goes by in the blink of an eye! For those who may not know, the original cut is 210 minutes long! I wonder what that version is like? Maybe I'll look into it another day, but that's beside the point. Let's just get back to my review. Bottom line, if you have a great story to balance out the comedy, then the length will not make any difference. As far as the acting goes, it's superb from all of the actors and actresses. This is a movie that takes every advantage possible from all of the actors and actresses. The cast is absolutely insane! You have: Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Phil Silvers, Terry-Thomas, Jonathan Winters, Edie Adams and Dorothy Provine. All of them are great actors, but that's just the main cast! This is one of the best casts I have ever seen in a comedy film. They all have impeccable chemistry with each other. Of course, that does not include all of the countless cameos throughout the movie, which there are many. If I had only one nitpick with it, and it's just a little tiny nitpick regarding the cameos, is the appearance of ""The Three Stooges"" characters. You're all thinking: ""what?!"" Well, let me explain why. Yes, ""The Three Stooges"" is my favorite TV show of all-time. However, when they show up in this movie, they do nothing but stand still and not say a word. That was kind of a disappointment for me, being such a devoted fan of ""The Three Stooges"". In their cameo, they are dressed as firemen and they are all holding a fire hose. But, as I mentioned, that's all they do in their appearance. They don't move or say anything at all. The writers could have given each of them a line, or they could have performed a bit of their classic routine slapstick. Or, since they played firemen, they could have just saved them for the end with the fire truck ladder scene. It's all just a nitpick, and it doesn't hurt the movie at all. I guess you could argue that less is more, because they are such iconic legends and they quite possibly could have detracted the audience away from the story. I mean, if I had the privilege of filming any of ""The Three Stooges"" actors, I would take every advantage I could! Still, it was absolutely awesome to see the three of them in this film. It's one of the best casts I have ever seen, in a way, it's like ""The Expendables"" as a comedy movie! All of the sets/locations are beautiful and give the movie a fantastic atmosphere. You can't go wrong with southern California! Finally, the soundtrack is excellent and it definitely sets the tone perfectly. Props to Ernest Gold, you composed a phenomenal film score! ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" is a comedic marvel and I'm happy that I stumbled upon it. This movie is what ""The Cannonball Run"" (1981) and ""Cannonball Run II"" (1984) tried and failed to be. There is a right way to do a big star-studded comedy film, and ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" is the 100% right way. I'll have to watch it again as soon as I can! I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this movie and you love comedy films, go watch this one. I guarantee that you'll laugh like you've never laughed before!",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

The screen is filled with every known comic (female & male) known in the comedy universe that was still performing (most of which have major roles,and others in walk on/cameos),and even the great Spencer Tracy,in a rare comedic role,for good measure. The plot:when an elderly gangster's car runs off of the road,the witnesses find out about a parcel of stolen money buried somewhere in a park. What results is a glorified chase scene for the money,with enough twists & turns to please all. The film has countless slapstick/physical comedy scenes to render many laughs. The film was originally released in the updated Cinerama process (not the original three projected process that was used in demonstration films,such as 'This Is Cinerama' from 1951),where everything was shot on one 70mm strip of film,but was projected on the same concave screen that creates the illusion of deep perspective---especially a memorable scene on a fire ladder). A film that is well worth seeking out (even if it's only available on DVD/Blue Ray disc). Originally released unrated long before the MPAA was organized,but was eventually re-released in 1970 with the requisite 'G' rating,making it perfect for family viewing.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
91,tcchelsey,COME CLEAN... ALL OF US KNOW PEOPLE LIKE THIS!,10,25 March 2020,"Although this was designed to be a story about a bunch of greedy kooks on steroids, all I can say is, especially as the years pass, I have known people like this who probably would have done the same thing.. if the opportunity arose! Kind of frightening, but not necessarily untrue, if you are old enough to sample life at its worst (at times). Kramer may have had this in mind when producing this opus, because it has to give the average Joe a little pause, who deep down inside, between the laughs, could hear that little infamous voice ask, ""Someone you know, em?"" I think it's true. This is a one of a kind movie, and one Hollywood will probably never see again, particularly for all the incredible talent involved, right down to the bits. Amazing indeed. Enjoy it for what it's worth, with all the gags, pratfalls, genuine silliness, one liners and the like, but there is no mistaking ""what fools these mortals be...""",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
92,Greatornot,Best G Rated Movie Ever,9,12 March 2008,"The charm of this movie is not in perfection. It is what it is, and that being just a fun movie to watch, at anytime; When you are down or even having a few beers with buddies or for kids to watch or to stroll down memory lane. In other words , its a film for everyone. The fact is the cast is stellar. I challenge anyone to come up with a better cast than this in any movie. I wont go thru the names but you get the idea.I challenge others to name me another cast that even comes close. There were more A-list actors in this movie than not, from this time period. This movie was ,basically, a celebration of these 'actors'. I read the goofs. Couple things to understand though, this movie is 45 yrs old.Besides the goofs are part of the aura , in my opinion. I hate to sound cliché but its TIMELESS. To take this movie seriously in the same tongue as say CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND, or even THERE WILL BE BLOOD is not only ridiculous but unfair. The movie rocks . I think I have seen the best facial reactions I have ever seen. The music was fit in perfectly. The lines were delivered with such precision and at times just great tidbits that hit the bulls eye ala Ethel Mermans rant of WHY THESE THINGS HAPPEN, simply superb. I will say I did not give this a ten , mainly because the plot was very simple, but a 9 is not too shabby.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
93,aramis-112-804880,A Guilty Pleasure,7,23 September 2013,"Many movies may boast that they have the greatest cast ever assembled, but no one will dispute ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" has the most legendary. It's a big, big, big, big movie with lots of comedy stars (circa 1963). ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" was created at at time when movies were getting bigger to compete with television. It was written by William Rose, who wrote the yard-for-yard funnier ""The Ladykillers."" Director Stanley Kramer's forte was not comedy, but hand-wringing topical melodrama.With so many comic geniuses in the cast, one might have had the courage to point out that bigger is not necessarily funnier.Most depressingly, ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" is chock full of wanton destruction. It might be funny to have a car crash with some particular point about plot or character development. It is funny when Phil Silvers' car sinks in the river or when the wheel comes off Terry-Thomas' machine. It is not funny playing demolition derby just because you can. Nor are some of the characters humorous in themselves. Milton Berle gets a lot of mileage out of his seaweed magnate. Sid Caesar (possibly because he was a last-minute replacement for Ernie Kovaks, who died shortly before filming) does not manage to wring much out of his dentist character. And for all the bluster of some characters who are always shouting and gesticulating, some of the best laughs from from deadpan throwaway lines from the likes of Jesse White.Many cameos are wasted today. In the twenty-first century a nostalgic giggle is no long elicited from a few second's sight of Zasu Pitts, Edward Everett Horton, Jack Benny, Joe E. Brown, or even the great Buster Keaton (who does more with his itty-bitty cameo than some of the main actors do with extended parts).This is not to say ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" can't be funny. Some of the humor comes from odd pairings. Newcomer Buddy Hackett and life-long star Mickey Rooney, on something like his third career, bounce off each other like they've always been a duo. Despite very different backgrounds, Milton Berle and Terry-Thomas play well together. And for my money, the single best scene is the all-too-brief teaming of Phil Silvers and Don Knotts.Though some of the main characters get lost in the shuffle, a few scene-stealers emerge. Phil Silvers' name keeps cropping up in this review. Another major scene-stealer is Broadway star Ethel Merman as Berle's uber-obnoxious mother-in-law (of the kind Berle made a living telling jokes about). Newcomer Dick Shawn, looking not the least bit like a comic character, has hilarious break-downs, particularly when he's trying to force a car off the road (one of the few times car destruction actually comes off with a laugh). Brilliant off-the-cuff comic Jonathan Winters was never quite as good with sustained characters in film or television, but his nimble truck driver has a few beautiful moments.Caught between the stars and the blink-and-you'll-miss-them parts (which, apart from one glimpse of the Three Stooges, will be mostly lost to all but old movie buffs) are cameo parts in the truest sense of the word. Near the end, a young-looking Peter Falk and an old-looking Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson are picked up as cab drivers; both are superb and they help give the movie a second wind as it flags toward the end. The invariably irritating but amusing Paul Ford pulls out all the stops of his schtick as a befuddled air traffic controller. Jim Backus, showing a preview of Thurston Howell III, raises a smile as the high-class pilot and drunk; while Ben Blue, forgotten today but for a handful of notable film appearances, is his usual other-worldly self as the lower-class flier of a World War I vintage biplane. And William Demarest's overacting is all that makes the police-station scenes endurable (besides the few shots of Madlyn Rhue, a hard-working actress in the 1960s, looking extremely sexy).In the center of the maelstrom stands Spencer Tracy, looking very old and tired (as befits his character). He may have been a great actor, but he lacks the comic timing of his co-stars and he makes the movie feel heavy at times.Of the twelve who travel throughout the movie, Silvers and Merman are worth the ride, with Winters and Shawn not far behind. Rooney and Hackett get their share of chuckles, especially in the airplane, though Rooney is a soupçon too manic on repeated viewings. Berle and Terry-Thomas are funny on and off; Caesar, hardly ever. Unfortunately overlooked is Edie Adams, who should have been playing with her late husband, Ernie Kovaks. Adams underplays magnificently -- while Caesar plays loud, watch Adams' simple looks. And Dorothy Provine, who had a significant presence in movies at one time (remember ""The Great Race,"" ""That Darn Cat,"" or ""Who's Minding the Mint?"") is stuck portraying the sole reluctant treasure hunter; but she has a pay-off in an almost ethereally wacky scene in the end.For all its many faults, I keep being drawn back to ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World."" I was brought up in the generation born just around the time this movie was made, and I am an old movie buff; so many of the great names, even those plugged into worthless parts, were not unknown to me. I keep coming back to it to laugh at the funny parts, which are good comedy done by true professionals; and I watch the rest of it with the interest of a rubbernecker at a train wreck.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
94,greene515,A Consummate Classic Comedy,10,4 July 2010,"Jimmy Durante tells a group of people in the Southern California desert that a large sum of money is buried ""under a big W"" in a park south of San Diego. Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett are gag writers headed for Las Vegas. Milton Berle is headed for a vacation with wife Dorothy Provine and Ethel Herman as the mother-in-law to beat all mothers-in-law. Sid Caesar and Edie Adams are a dentist and his wife. And Jonathan Winters is driving a van of furniture. Monitoring all of them, as they race after the money, is Spencer Tracy as the police captain. So we have a slapstick chase movie to end all slapstick chase movies. Heading a golden age of television cast are Caesar and Adams, who get to fly in a makeshift plane, then get locked in a hardware store basement. In a career performance, Winters hilariously gets to completely demolish a desert gas station. Berle has a running battle with the mother-in-law from Hell, Merman, who in turn has been given some gloriously acidic dialog by superb screenwriter's William and Tania Rose. The Roses have never been given enough credit here. All of the sublime dialog is on the printed page. Along the way, Winters meets up with Phil Silvers, who in turn mixes up with miner Mike Mazurki. Silvers is staggeringly funny with a car at the bottom of a canyon, then later drowning in a river. Rooney and Hackett are in another plane that flies through a Coke billboard after pilot Jim Backus knocks himself unconscious. There is also Dick Shawn as Merman's lifeguard son at Silver Strand Beach. And a phone running battle in his inner police office with Tracy and his wife and daughter that escalates over a simple vacation. And this is only part one, before the film's intermission! Part two has some of the funniest dialog and greatest car chases in all of movie history for me. And the grand climax has never been topped for me--not even by silent era clowns.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
95,williampsamuel,A laugh a second from a comedic dream team,8,25 December 2014,"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World is one of the nuttiest, zaniest, most sidesplitting comedies to come out of the 1960s. It starts out with a bang and rarely lets up. With a cast including Spencer Tracy, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett, Cid Caesar, and even the three stooges, expectations are high, and believe me, they're more than met here.The movie opens with one of the screen's most outrageous death scenes, in which dying conman 'Smiler' Grogan reveals to onlookers that he hid three-hundred and fifty grand under the big W in a California state park. When attempts to be reasonable and work out a deal fail, four carloads of people set out to be the first to reach the money, any way they can.These normally law-abiding people will lie, cheat, steal, double cross, do absolutely anything to get an edge. Alliances are made and broken with a frequency that surpasses even survivor. The situation snowballs out of control as more and more people are let in on the secret and succumb to the fever. And all the while, unbeknownst to them, their every move is being watched by the police.The movie's real genius is to let each member of its diverse cast play to his/her strengths. Ethel Merman takes the mother-in-law shtick to new heights, bickering with everyone she meets, yelling, screaming, and constantly tearing into her luckless son-in-law (Milton Berle), the weak willed manager of an edible seaweed company. As far as she's concerned, everybody's an idiot, and either it's her way, or their pulling off the highway.Her son Sylveter (Dick Shawn) is an even bigger basket case, completely misunderstanding the situation at every turn and going through endless histrionics. Caesar, for his part, spends almost half the movie locked in a basement along with his wife (Edie Adems). This may not sound promising, but each of his attempts to escape is funnier than the last, as his frustration and anger build and his methods escalate.But for anger management issues, no-one can hold a candle to truck driver Lennie (Pike). In what might be the film's most hilarious scene, he completely demolishes a gas station as he tries to get his hands on a pair of hapless attendants. Often, scenes like this are a desperate attempt to get laughs, with it being painfully obvious that the actor is going out of his way to knock things over. But here, the destruction is a natural by-product of the fight, and the scene builds and builds until the whole heap comes crashing down.And what's got him so hot under the collar? The treachery of Otto Meyer (Phil ""The King of Chutzpah"" Silvers). He wasn't even one of the original witnesses, but he's the biggest schemer and conniver in the bunch, hands down. He plays everyone one he comes across, fast talking his way through every situation with outrageous lies. He'd beat everyone to the money for sure if he didn't have the worst possible luck.Terry-Thomas puts in a part as a typically bullish Brit, who turns out to be quite the pansy when the going gets tough. His verbal, and eventually physical, sparring with Berle is priceless. Meanwhile, Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett find themselves on a terrifying flight with the world's most booze soaked aviator, and Don Knotts even makes a cameo as a sheep for Silvers to fleece.But the guy with the most problems just might be Captain Culpepper (Spencer Tracy). He's got enough on his plate keeping track of these nuts, but family issues and ongoing squabbles over his pension keep butting in. It also begins to seem that he's strangely preoccupied with something else. Is this guy crazy, or crazy like a fox? Eventually all the big players are gathered beneath the big W, which I wouldn't dare reveal the identity of. But even when the money's found, it ain't over yet. The movie continues to a completely over the top conclusion, in which everybody gets exactly what's coming to them.Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World is bit on the long side at two and a half hours, but the running time is necessary to give every cast member time to shine, and as they say, no good movie is too long. This is a real comedy gem, appropriate for the whole family. If you're looking for a good laugh, count on this one to deliver.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
96,jeremy3,One of the funniest films ever produced,10,16 November 2008,"This movie is probably the greatest experiment in comedy ever produced. The director, Stanley Kramer, got pegged as a serious director. Therefore, he wanted to prove that he could make a comedy. With no experience in comedy, somehow Kramer managed to attract nearly every famous comedian in Hollywood. This movie, then, basically is a chance to see all the great talents of the early 60s in one film! That's what makes this movie so delightful. There is more comic genius going on then in any film I have ever seen. What also made this film work so wonderfully was the combination of a good story, excellent filming, and amazing stunts. The story starts out with an old man (Jimmy Durante) who crashes his car in the desert after being changed by the Santa Rosita police force. With several witnesses present, he tells them that he has buried $350,000 at a state park under the letter ""W"".What makes this funny is the greed and calculation that is unleashed. The cast of characters - ranging from Rooney to Caesar - do the most hilarious things to out duel one another in getting to the money first. The other thing that makes this funny is Spencer Tracy. He is the straight laced, family man, police chief, who just wants to afford to retire from the Santa Rosita Police Department. He is all part of the insanity that greed unleashes, because he wants the money, too. Lastly, there was no other movie like this in the early 60s.

But boy! was I disappointed! In fact, I don't recall laughing at all; just a couple of smiles when Ethel Merman was in the screen and with the cameo appearances of Jerry Lewis and ""The Three Stooges"".The script and dialogues lack imagination and the pretended funny situations come just from pure visual sequences with the guys destroying a hardware store, a gas station, an airport and some other stuff.Really weak as a comedy and sort of interesting as a special effects product for the 60's, ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" is a waste of money, cast, director and time for those of us that thought we were going to see the ultimate comedy film.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
98,dimplet,"If you can't laugh at the absurdity of life, you won't get it",9,28 June 2011,"I was prompted to look at this again by the recent death of Peter Falk, ""Colombo,' who plays a cabbie near the end of the movie. Just watching Falk and Rochester made me smile and laugh. Some people say this film works, others say it doesn't. I think they're both right. It is a rare comedy that is funny every time you watch it; most only work once. I have watched this many times over the years, beginning with seeing it in the theater as a kid. Sometimes when I watch it, I chuckle over every detail of a scene, sometimes laughing out loud. Other times I am just amused. And sometimes I am slightly bored. The question is why -- why does it work sometimes, and not others? I guess you have to be in the right mood. You also need to not look too closely at the plot as a whole, but rather at the absurdity of the individual scenes, and how beautifully they are played by the great comic actors, even the tiny cameos. What ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" is ultimately about is the absurdity of the whole damn crazy human condition, and that we are all fools for taking it so seriously. The movie is saying, the whole world and everyone on it has gone mad, probably including you. This was a common theme back in the Sixties -- A Thousand Clowns, Stop the World, I Want to Get Off, etc. Now the world's a lot crazier, yet we have become more serious, and don't find the mass insanity quite so amusing now that it has become so dangerous and annoying. So, if you can't see the world is nuts, and can't laugh at it, you might have trouble enjoying this film. That's how it all ends -- they all realize they're nuts. And there may be a problem with this edited down version, cut by about a half-hour from the original. A reviewer on Amazon said this took out the context for many of the scenes, leaving mainly the slapstick, which may be why the film doesn't work for some people. Perhaps someone was afraid it would slow things down. But I think change of pace is a good thing for comedy, and more grounding in reality would have strengthened this movie. Perhaps a restored version will be released one day. I wonder how Europeans like this film, vs. Americans? I hear they love Jerry Lewis, and this is a very Jerry Lewis approach to American comedy, which is to make fun of straight-laced American mores. Say, where is Jerry Lewis, anyway? Don't blink. I suspect this is one American movie that foreigners are better able to enjoy than Americans.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

How Stanley Kramer and Spencer Tracy, two of the best and most ethical entertainers of their generation, could create such a monstrosity is beyond me. Both ought to have known better. Both ought to have seen how irredeemable, how mean- spirited this movie is. Audiences often love mean-spirited comedies, and in this case many critics have also been enamored of it, but Kramer and Tracy should not have—need not have—stooped to this lowest of common denominators. One of the film's most minor but still egregiously awful mistakes is its misuse of the Three Stooges (well, two Stooges plus Curly Joe.) The quintessential masters of slapstick are cast in a madcap physical comedy but are made to stand perfectly still and silent for all of five seconds.

There are more laughs in Airplane (88mins.) or Take the Money and Run (85mins) than in the 154mins of IAMMMMW! Since everyone is one-dimensional and constantly squabbling, they overstay their welcome. Stanley Kramer, director of The Defiant Ones, On the Beach, Judgement at Nuremberg and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, never had a flair for comedy or for that matter cinema There are more (unintentional) laughs in Kramer's Ship of Fools(1965)than in IAMMMMW!

Casting is the major problem:  not only are there too many stars fighting over the audience's attention, they have widely divergent styles which end up creating a mess.

As these people split up, the film flashes back and forth between each character and the ridiculous situations they find themselves in every couple of minutes. Everything from car crashes to destroying gas stations to landing planes after pilots are knocked out happens in this film, and the incidents continually get more people involved in the rush. Most of the specific gags are too funny to give away here. This film must be seen to realize just how funny everything in it is.

106,vox-sane,More than the sum of its parts,10,20 March 2001,"Often accused of being less than the sum of its parts, ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is one of the most precious gems in filmdom.  True, it's far from being the funniest movie ever.  Once, when Monty Python was putting a film together, they found that after fifty-odd minutes the audience stopped laughing.  Thinking it was the material, they recut it so the latter material came out first.  The audience still stopped laughing at fifty-odd minutes, even with what MP assumed the funnier materials backloaded.  The fact is, people can only laugh so long.Even armed with the information that an audience cannot sustain laughter for three hours, ""Mad World"" is not overwhelmingly funny.  Though lots of dialogue is amusing and all the performances are outstanding, but the movie suffers from a common delusion of people outside comedy, as Stanley Kramer was, that the mere vision of cars crashing is somehow funny in itself. One is reminded of the spectacular sequence in ""1941"" when a ferris wheel breaks loose and rolls off a pier into the ocean.  The sequence itself is jaw-dropping and extremely well-done, and not funny for a moment.The value in ""Mad World"" is its cast.  Most of the big names in comedy in the 1950s and 1960s made it into the cast (Ernie Kovaks, arguably the brightest of the lot, originally cast in the Sid Caesar role, unfortunately died not long before shooting started).  The casting of name comics in tiny roles doesn't do them justice:  Stan Freberg has nothing to do but watch Andy Devine talk on the telephone;  Doodles Weaver is an uncredited ""Man Outside Hardware Store"";  the Three Stooges merely show up to be recognized; even Jack Benny, in a miniscule role funny merely because he's in it, doesn't have an impact today because too few people remember who he was. Again, some milk their small roles for what they are worth, giving the movie an undercurrent of true humor beyond the principals:  Don Knotts, Carl Reiner, Jesse White, Paul Ford, Jim Backus.""Mad World"" is most valuable simply because it is a cross-section of comedy in its day.  Although he was talented in many ways, anyone unfamiliar with Phil Silvers will see him in a performance that was the epitome of what he was famous for.  Dick Shawn's manic wildness is captured forever in a way that is little seen in his few other films.  Terry-Thomas, whose brilliance was too often relegated to obscure British films rarely seen anymore, is a joy to watch and his British tilt provides a variation from Americans who learned their craft in the Catskills and Vaudeville.  Jonathan Winters, whom Robin Williams used as a prototype, was the most gifted ad-lib comic of his day and rarely showed up well when he was constrained by a script and a sustained character, but he brings off many of the best laughs in this film, and, with Arnold Stang and Marvin Kaplan the most memorable set piece in the movie.  Milton Berle and Micky Rooney both bring lifetimes of stage and screen work to the project, and their input was invaluable.
All the principals (Berle, Caesar, Adams, Rooney, Hackett, Terry-Thomas, Shawn, Silvers, Winters, Anderson, Falk) are good.  Even the ones who seem to have been shorted of funny lines, like Edie Adams, and Eddie Anderson, nevertheless come off well.  Although they blend well together, there is a subtle fight between them for attention, to steal a scene with a facial expressions (watch Adams' face, for instance, when Caesar drags her away, in front of the ""Big W"", though you may have to put it on slow-motion) or a bit of business.  You can see each of them thinking, at all times.  Each gives an intelligent performance, having laboriously hammered out their timing and their business, and they're all thinking, with the clockwork brains the best comedians have.  They may not all be funny every minute, but every moment they know what they're doing, crafting better performances than many Oscar-winning serious actors have ever turned in.Though the movie might be too bloated for the promised three hours' hilarious ride, with too much dependence on, ""Hey, there's Edward Everett Horton flicking a switch!""  But anyone who loves comedy and its history needs -- deserves --  to see the best in the business of comedy in 1963 interacting with their schtick, especially if they don't mind sitting through -- occasionally mindless -- car chases and crashes.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
107,lotus_chief,Very funny movie after all these years,8,11 February 2004,"**SPOILERS BELOW!  You were warned!!**I watched this last night after my girlfriend suggested I see it.  This was a very funny movie.  My experience was a bit spoiled from seeing the 2001 remake, 'Rat Race' months before without knowing it was a remake.  Come to think of it, now that I've seen the original, Rat Race was a REALLY BAD remake!  Anyway back to the original.....the majority of the characters in 'It's A Mad....Mad World' were hilarious.  Never before have I seen such an ensemble of comedians at the top of their game giving such great performances.  My gripes with the film: the 'mother-in-law' was so ANNOYING!  I understand her 'ways' were intended to be funny, but it got way past that.  I didn't laugh but cringe every time she opened her mouth.  Another gripe was the ending, I just got a bad taste in my mouth seeing that NO ONE won the money.  That I had to sit there for 2 1/2 hours being totally caught up in this big adventure, just to find out that no one wins the money....I felt robbed.  I would've rather had everyone get a share.  Okay okay, I get the point with the morals of the story, but it still rubbed me the wrong way.  I also thought the ending was a little too over the top.  The level of slapstick comedy was just fine with me until this point.  The whole deal with 15-20 people on the fire escape/ladder, and the ladder turning into an amusement park ride throwing people every which way was a little too much IMO....I felt the line was finally crossed between slapstick and complete lack of logic/reason.  Aside from that this film is a classic comedy and I really enjoyed it.  I definitely recommend it; even 40 years later it still seems fresh....better than the so-called 'comedies' being released today.  My favorite characters - the truck driver, and the two guys trying to land the plane near the end. They were great.*** out of **** stars.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

Milton Berle was not, nor has ever been, funny.
Sid Caeser is not only NOT funny, he is kind of scary.
Dick Shawn is just a fool on parade, ridiculously unfunny.
Jonathan Winters may Think He Is Funny, but sadly, this movie proves he is not.
Phil Silvers is just so pathetic, its hard to find any kind words to say about the poor man.And Spencer Tracy. Good grief, the man looks like the Old Man and the Sea who just woke up from a three month drunk.When Ethel Merman is more believable bellowing than Mickey Rooney saying his lines, you've gone off the page pal.But Terry-Thomas is a bright light in this mayhem, as are Peter Falk and Eddie Anderson in their brief turns as cabbies.And you absolutley must give a shout out to Marvin Kaplan and Arnold Stang, though much of their fight with Winters was done by stunt men.In summing up, if you find yourself home alone, stuck in bed with the flu, misplaced the remote, and this comes on, at least you can be assured of a nice 2 and a half hour nap.Sorry Stanley.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

Making it even more enjoyable are the vast number of stars in cameo roles, and this ""spot the actor"" adds to the fun - it also has a bit of pathos in that nearly all of those have left us, and Movies are the worse off for their departure. I feel the stand-out performance came from Ethel Merman who really enjoyed the romp. It was a far cry from the pictures one expects from this Director,(Stanley Kramer) as is the casting of Spencer Tracy as Culpepper - the slapstick scenes in the last 15 minutes must have been an anathema to Tracy who at least seemed to enter into the spirit of things.

110,Barky44,The Best Slapstick Farce Ever Filmed,10,13 July 2005,"I absolutely love this movie! It is hands-down the best slapstick farce ever caught on film. It is truly a wonder to behold. I have seen Mad World at least a dozen times, and every time I roar out loud with laughter, waiting with baited breath for the next scene.The assemblage of this film is absolutely brilliant. In so many ways it's just a wonder to behold.It has a terrific, legendary cast: Milton Berle, Sid Caeser, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett, Ethel Merman, Phil Silvers and surprise roles like Dick Shawn as a tough-guy hipster and, of course, Spencer Tracy! Spencer Tracy in a comedic farce, just sit and dwell on THAT for a moment or two! Throw on the dozens of cameos from other icons like Don Knotts, Jim Backus, Carl Reiner, the Three Stooges and Jimmy Durante, and you have a complete miracle of a cast. There isn't a casting director in all of Hollywood that could complete THAT feat again! The pacing of the film is incredible. There is hardly a slow period in the film, it is a non-stop, laugh-a-minute production. Stanley Kubrick (another point one should dwell on: Stanley Kubrick directed this film!) is an absolute master of comedic pacing on film. The scenes just flow one into another into another forming a strong chain of laughs from one end to the next. And all the little details just add to the panache! Dorothy Provine losing a shoe as they're chasing Spencer Tracy; Jim Backus rolling around in the background as Rooney & Hackett fiddle around in the cockpit; the little boy waving at Phil Silvers as he sinks in the river. It takes a genius to realize that comedies have huge moments (like Jonathan Winters riding the little girl's bike) and tiny moments (Buster Keaton's little dance at the docks) and together these moments make a great film.It's outstanding how this storyline and sequence of events was concocted, and apparently it was all created by a single pair of writers! I can't imagine the fun that these two must have had assembling a true comic epic such as this! This thing is three hours long! Yet it just zooms on by, you're laughing the entire time! It's such a great combination of many facets of comedy: slapstick, one-liners, long setups, sound gimmicks, even political satire in the duel between Milton Berle and Terry Thomas. The writers realized they had a huge bag of tricks to draw on, and draw on it they did. There's stuff from every comedic genre here, and it knits together amazingly well.The stunt work is completely amazing as well. This film has it all: high falls, car chases, explosions, brawls, plane crashes, and a finale that has yet to be beat in ANY comedy flick to date. Sure some parts are hokey, like the breakaway gas station, but that scene is such a side-splitter (with great cameos by Arnold Stang and Marvin Kaplan as the hapless mechanics) the balsa wood is forgivable. The twin-engine plane pilot STILL sets the bar high for aerial stunts, the crash through the billboard is legendary. All the explosions in the basement of the hardware store are great fun to watch. The car chases still make you grip your armrests with excitement. And it has dogs ... what good comedy doesn't include dogs! The beauty of this film is it takes ever possible bit that can ever be used in a film (or radio for that matter), throws them in a big pot and makes a terrific stew. It was an incredibly bold move for the filmmakers to do what they did, but they pulled it off. As funny as movies made since (like ""Airplane"", ""There's Something About Merry"", all the Mel Brooks films, all the teen comedies) have been, there has never been another film that contains as many elements, brilliantly executed, as ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" 10 out of 10. One of my all-time favorites.Barky",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
111,Nate-48,Starts out like a locomotive and then drags on like a tortoise,7,26 September 2018,"I gave this a 7 for the sheer breadth and scale of the comedy adventure, but most of all for the incredible acting ensemble that is almost unparalleled in its scope in movie history. I would have graded it lower because it goes on too long but the number of great actors in this film make it a must-see.I believe the first 15 minutes are among the best and funniest in picture history.The rest of the film gets carried away and lost mostly, though there are enough good parts, gags and great acting that make it worthwhile to stick through.Acting performances in order of my fondness:Sid Caesar - his comic genius is apparent from his delivery, facial expressions and presence. He gets some great lines, particularly in the first half hour or so. It is astounding that he did not have a greater film career after ruling TV. Mickey Rooney - almost unrecognizable until he takes off his shades. He is 20 years past his prime here but shows all of the tools that made him so great.Spencer Tracy - he almost doesn't need an explanation, he is always great.Jonathan Winters - brilliant comedian has a bit about taxes near the beginning that will have you laughing out loud for five minutesPeter Falk - doesn't show up until the end and absolutely steals the show. I didn't know that he had been nominated for 2 Oscars already at the time of the filming.Buddy Hackett - perfect for the role, another who should have had a better TV careerJimmy Durante - absolutely kills it in opening sceneEthel Merman - tour de force, she never quitsJerry Lewis - is on the screen for 5 seconds and kills itMilton Berle - perfect role, supremely well played and underplayedJack Benny - another guy on for five seconds who I wish could have been on a lot longerEddie Rochester Anderson - Benny's right hand man has a great part hereDon Knotts - what a loveable characterPhil Silvers - plays a great jerk, I don't know much about him but he is worth looking up if you don'tWilliam Demarest - you won't find a much better police chief anywhereJoe E.

112,wwe7961,:),10,19 September 2010,"For my summary I couldn't think of a summary good enough to show just how entertaining this movie is. So all I did was show what this movie will make you do for about 3 hours. This movie in terms of pure entertainment will have you eating 15 boxes of popcorn by the end. It is just amazing how much fun can be had with this movie. The jokes never fall flat, the movie never gets dull, and it will entertain you to the point where you'll be knocked out cold when the credits start rolling. It is a true showing of just how entertaining a film can be. Yeah I think that a film making me cry is more impressive than entertaining me a bit, but sometimes you want to take a break and enjoy yourself. You'll take out a comedy, put it in the DVD player, and have a few good laughs, but this movie takes it as far entertainment can go. So in my opinion this is the most entertaining movie ever made. Not the best in my mind, but the fun I had with this movie has skyrocketed this film very high on my list of favorite movies. The characters, music, and acting are also very good. It's filled to the brim with cameos of every big comedic star at the time. They are totally pointless, but add more to the fun to be had. As for the main cast of big comedic stars everyone is hilarious, and bring these characters to life. Also I love the music in this movie. Just the intro credits on their own could be considered a short film with the fun animation, and great music. It also has a smart original idea for it. It's all one big race to try and get to a stash of money. That alone is a fun idea, but this movie for the way through is particularly in real time. That makes you feel more engaged in the movie, and it makes you feel like your watching an actual race rather than a movie. It's like Nascar just not boring. I also like how we start out with our big characters. We think they are the only people we will follow, but as we go along more people join in the race. My favorite part I think is the ending scene, but it is best to look at the film all together as one big great part of film history. Overall this movie is as fun as I have ever seen film get, and most likely I will never see one that is more entertaining.4 stars out of 4",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
113,thinbeach,"Grand size, bland jokes",3,31 August 2019,"The set up has great potential: A dying man tells a group of unrelated roadside travellers the whereabouts of hidden cash. After failing to find a reasonable way to co-operate and split the money between them, the group take an every man for himself approach - driving, flying, hitchhiking and cycling their way to the site. Partners are switched and police join the chase, but no matter what happens, it all falls apart in epic fashion. There is a moral here about the woes of chasing money, but unfortunately only one character has any scruples, and they are caught up in it anyway.Shot on 70mm for cinerama, with huge ensemble cast including many big name comedians, 3hr plus runtime and numerous stunts, it was an extremely ambitious project - the studios threw everything at it - which is probably the only reason anyone still hears about it today. The jokes fall flat completely. Slapstick had its heyday some 30 or 40 years earlier, and this is wacky, rather than clever. The final sequence mimics both Harold Lloyds 'Safety Last' and Buster Keaton's (who is given a tiny cameo, and manages a clever little blink and you'll miss it gag - the kind of detail laced throughout his own films sorely missing in this one) epic stunts, but pales in comparison. 'Airplane!', which came later, is also a far funnier flight disaster comedy.I saw the longer version - where beautiful pristine footage of the original release was intercut with far less well preserved footage (originally omitted), along with some still images accompanying dialogue they didn't have footage for. The film was too long anyway, and the added footage didn't add anything necessary, nor improve upon what was already there, so I strongly recommend watching the shorter version instead.

It is certainly not for everyone. It is the wackiest of slapstick comedies: everything--plot, character, and certainly any hint of plausibility--is sacrificed for the jokes, and the jokes are not what you'd call ""subtle"" or ""intellectual.""

God help us... overrated. No way. If anything, it is UNDERrated. I see people complaining about the endless shouting, the over the top slapstick, the brashness, the loudness, the length. I can only conclude that these people are a bunch of humorless dorks.First of all, you can't just sit down to watch a three hour movie without knowing what you're in for. This is not your typical comedy--this is an EPIC comedy, the first of its kind, that inspired other such epics as ""Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines"" and ""The Great Race"" (which happens to be my favorite comedy--in fact, I'd like to say it's the better movie, but props go to this one for inventing the genre). And I can't speak for everyone else, but this movie leaves me laughing from start to finish.Yes, it is very long, but it NEVER has a dull moment. Even if the amazing car stunts aren't particularly funny, you can't tell me they aren't wildly entertaining. I have yet to see an action movie with better car chases than these. And yes, the slapstick is ridiculously over the top, although I can't see how that's a problem (the gas station scene is one of the funniest in movie history, in my opinion). But underneath all the slapstick and shouting, holding the whole movie together, is that incredibly cynical message. It is a movie about kind, decent folks turning into law-breaking lunatics and ruining their lives for the sake of money. The subplot with Spencer Tracey realizing his entire life has been a waste, and then ruining what life he has left, is one of the most tragic story lines I have seen. But it's also pretty darn funny.All the critics need to lighten up and see this for the absurd, delirious, hysterical farce it is.10/10 stars.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
116,yonhope,Where is 1963 when we need it?,10,13 March 2004,"Hi, Everyone,I saw this movie when it first showed. I was a 25 year old Las Vegas deejay at the time. Did you know the theme song was a minor hit?I don't want to say this is the funniest movie ever made, but I cannot think of any that were funnier. The cast was possibly the best assembled for a comedy. Most of the actors had starred in their own vehicles and were very famous and in top form. Berle had been number one on TV. Ceasar had been the star of ""Your Show of Shows,"" one of the most respected early TV series. Ethel Merman was a Broadway star. Jimmy Durante was a star of radio, TV and movies. Jonathan Winters was big on TV. Mickey Rooney had been the top box office star just 22 years before this movie was made. Spencer Tracey was certainly a major Hollywood actor. Buddy Hackett was a regular star on Colgate Comedy Hour. My point is, these were big stars who were not just doing cameo bits. They were given major parts and they were working long hours without one guy getting top billing.The fist fight between Milton Berle and Terry Thomas would not have been so funny if they had been 15 years older. Each actor seemed to be at his peak. Maybe the smaller bit roles were done just as a bow to great talent (Buster Keaton, Ben Blue, Three Stooges, Eddie Rochchester Anderson), but they got their laughs. Berle and Phil Silvers had been in a fierce TV ratings battle about 7 years before this movie was made. That type of information was known to the audiences of that era and it made the movie even funnier. Everyone hated everyone in this film. Their only common interest was the hatred they developed for the Ethel Merman character. The attempts to be nice and come to an agreement offered by Sid Caesar and Jonathan Winters are quickly abandoned for small two man groups trying to get the treasure for themselves. Even Spencer Tracey shares their disgust.I would have welcomed a longer 3 Stooges routine. I would have liked to have seen Ernie Kovaks and Jackie Gleason and maybe Danny Kaye in this, but it is already filled with great talent doing wonderful scenes. The bicycle scene with Jonathan Winters, the airplane with Sid Ceasar, the airplane scene with Mickey Rooney, Jim Backus and Buddy Hackett, the hardware store basement with Sid Ceasar. Dick Shawn's phone call to his mom is a great look at the 60s sub culture. If the film were to be remade today, and I think it could be, I wonder who would be whom? Some of the original actors are still alive. Winters, Marvin Caplan, Caesar and a few others might do cameos. Maybe Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Wil Farrell, Steve Martin, Chevy Chase and Dan Ackroyd as starters. It would be hard to make anything better than the original. Maybe Tina Turner for Ethel Merman?Tom Willett",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
117,movibuf1962,Where should I put this?!,8,13 February 2003,"The all-star ensemble comedy is a dying genre and few have been executed as well as this one- just for sheer plot and showmanship alone. (It must've been daunting for Stanley Kramer to assemble this roster back in the early 60's and concoct a plausible story- with writers William & Tania Rose- which would assemble so many stars together for nearly 3 hours.) There had been a VHS release of this back in the 80's which partially restored a lot of cut footage, but the DVD has reverted back to the pared-down theatrical release which, depending on your opinion of film purity, you may or may not like. (The DVD does, however, include the missing scenes in a separate link.) I like the DVD mainly because it puts the film back in its 'Ultra-Panavision' wide screen format, which is the only way to see something of this scope. Also nice is a 'making of' documentary which takes interviews from various cast and crew members (although, sadly, some have since passed away, including director Stanley Kramer). I never liked the end of the movie (and actually preferred the spin done on its unacknowledged remake, RAT RACE). Ironically, the scene which I regard as the best in the film comes immediately before the conclusion, and that is the arrival of the entire cast in the park, where the 'big W' is finally revealed- several cleverly placed times, if you look carefully. (We, the viewers, become part of the treasure hunt, and it's fantastic.)

Not to mention the classic hardware store sequence where Sid Ceaser and Edie Adams are trapped in the basement and have ti dynamite themselves out.

This is the second review I have done of a Kramer film recently the other being ""Judgment at Nuremberg."" So is this movie truly a classic, I say hell yes! This movie is hilarious (the exact opposite of Nuremberg). The movie starts with a dying man telling a group of perfect strangers about the location where a large stash of cash is buried and the hilarity ensues. This movie has an ensemble cast, which includes several of the best comedians of the 60's including Jonathan Winters and Phil Silvers. This movie is also full of cameo appearances including a brief shot of the three stooges. This movie is just one laugh after another. It is perfectly acted, and the story allows the characters to get into crazy disasters one after the other, without seeming contrived. A very similar movie was made a few years ago called ""rat race."" However, this film is far superior though I did kind of like rat race, it's funny (not good but funny).

This movie was so good because there were mostly greedy men trying to get $350,000 under this big ""W"". In the beginning of the movie, about five people were told about the $350,000 under the big ""W"". Then, later, a few other people were involved in the race to find the money. There were also car chases in this movie. Even the captain of the police department in Santa Rosita was involved in this. Two of the ladies were involved in this. The main lady's mom, a character named Melville, his wife was involved. But the main lady just wanted to take the money and live in a convent. At least that's what she said. But this movie was pretty much car chases, plane flying, driving, etc. It was a disaster. And one couple got stuck in a store basement when the manager thought no one was in there and locked the door on them. They finally broke out after destroying 3 quarters of the basement for about an hour! Everyone finally gets to Santa Rosita Park and after they dig the money up, they were fooled by the Captain Culpepper because he told them to turn themselves in to jail because they did many bad things like steal cars to try to get to the money because their cars broke down, etc. He fooled them because he had the money in his car and drove the opposite way they were driving in a cab. He wanted to go somewhere far away with the money but they start chasing Captain Culpepper until they get to a building. This building had a fire escape and everyone is trying to chase the Captain Culpepper because he has the money in his hands. The unfortunate thing is the fire escape sort of collapses and everyone is dangling until a fire truck comes and saves them. Yet it really didn't save them because too many people were on the ladder of the truck trying to go down to be safe instead everyone gets injured.... The next thing you know it, they're all in the hospital. Then here come the three women involved.

It has the dry humor that Abbott and Costello use and slapstick humor that the Three Stooges (who make a cameo in this film) use and it utilizes it perfectly. The cast also employs many old comedy legends like Jonathan Winters, and Mickey Rooney just to name a couple. Most major comedy movies today are unfunny parodies or gross-out humor which I don't find funny.The premise is quite simple. Several people find a dead man on the side of the road. In his dying words he tells them of a big W and under it is a treasure of roughly $300,000 which at that time was the mother lode. It's still a lot of money today, but back then it was definitely a lot. Afterwards it becomes a frantic race of who gets there first. They also pick up new people along the way who also want a piece of the pie. You also have a police officer named Culpepper who is also after the money. He claims to be after it to turn it in by law but he really wants it for himself.There's not much to say. The premise good, the cast is great, the characters are all memorable in some way, and I just found it funny. The extreme situations these people get themselves into here is just fun to watch.

This is still the granddaddy of all comedy/adventures directed by Stanley Kramer, who up to this point had only directed serious dramas like THE DEFIANT ONES and JUDGMENT AT NUREMBURG. A dying man (Jimmy Durante) who was thrown from a car that careened over a cliff, tells a group of witnesses to the accident (Sid Ceasar, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett, Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters) that there is $350,000.00 hidden under a big ""W"" in a nearby town, which sets off one of the wildest, craziest chase comedies made in the history of cinema. A rather tired and haggard looking Spencer Tracy heads the cast as the cop on the trail of these greedy money-mongers and just about every comedian or comic actor alive in 1963 appears in this film, either in a starring role or cameo and despite this impressive gathering of the best comedic talent in the business, towering over all of them in one of her few film performances, is Broadway legend Ethel Merman, who gives the performance of a lifetime as Berle's shrew of a mother-in-law. Her performance alone makes IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD worth seeing. Check out this classic if you've never seen it.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
127,CatRufus5591,"A great, great time capsule of comedy, 1963.",8,6 September 2021,"This madcap comedy holds a special place in my memory as I saw it with my family on the big screen in 1963 at the Golf Mill Theater in Niles, Illinois.No need to give a synopsis of the film as others have done here; just suffice it to say it still holds up in 2021 (My girlfriend will agree; I shared it with her over the weekend since she had never seen it, and apart from thinking it was a bit overlong, she loved it).Sad to say that racist overtones were alive and well in 1963: A Black man and his wife,
in their overloaded pickup truck, are sent tumbling down a hill as he gapes wide-eyed
in 'Step'n Fetchit' fashion; Rochester falls from the fire escape at the film's conclusion and right into the lap of a large statue of: Abraham Lincoln! As I recall, the 1963 audience roared with laughter at these scenes. Not so funny today, for sure.In any case, this is a fascinating time capsule of comedy. Yes, a bit overlong, but well worth the crazy trip if you stick with it.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
128,Holdjerhorses,More is Less,2,20 December 2007,"Contrary to some other comments, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" -- though released by the Cinerama corporation -- was not shot in the Cinerama process. It was filmed in Ultra Panavision 70, a one-strip process. That's your first tip that you're getting ripped off by IAMMMMW. The one-strip ""Cinerama"" films were NOTHING like the original three-strip effect.It's obvious that a tremendous amount of work and preparation went into this feature. A tremendous amount of work. With a tremendous amount of stars. All doing tremendous amounts of work. And tremendous amounts of stuntpeople and special effects teams doing tremendous amounts of work.A tremendous amount of work is up there on the screen, and IAMMMMW never lets you forget it.There's not a single spontaneous moment in the entire enterprise. Lots of comedians get to do their schtick. Lots of comedians are also utterly wasted (most prominently, Jonathan Winters).If you think Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson (Jack Benny's black sidekick) getting thrown off a ten-story fire-truck ladder and ""accidentally"" landing in the arms of an Abraham Lincoln statue is funny, this is your movie. How many outdoor parks outside the Lincoln Memorial (which is covered, by the way) have YOU ever seen with a reproduction of the Lincoln Memorial statue? Answer? None.The humor here was long dated before the film was released.All that work up there on the screen looks like just what it is: a lot of tedious work. A huge disappointment at the time, and an even bigger one today.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
129,matlefebvre20,"It's a Funny, Funny, Funny, Funny Movie",8,29 August 2006,"""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" could be described as the ""quintessential comedy"". It features elements from almost every kind of comedy that has been made before. An unrelenting farce, ""Mad World"" never gives you a moment to rid yourself of the smiling face that you'll have during the two and a half hours it lasts.The story is supposedly very simple and it begins quite quick. An old prisoner who escaped from jail has a serious accident and before passing away, he reveals to the five witnesses around him that he buried a treasure in Santa Rosita Park ""under the big W"".The five men agree to search for the treasure altogether, but because one of the guys is accompanied by his wife, another one by his spouse and his annoying mother-in-law, two of them are together and the last one is alone, dividing the treasure into equal parts becomes too much difficult (ah, women...), so it becomes ""every man for himself"".From that moment, the movie turns into a monumental collection of goofy moments, involving more and more characters, each one earning his merit. They're all played by legendary comedic actors, ranging from Spencer Tracy to Jonathan Winters, and including Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett and Mickey Rooney. Other legends are also only cameos, such as Buster Keaton and the Three Stooges.The comic elements of ""Mad World"" are so much diverse that we could think that every joke or funny moment that has been put on screen is presented here.The movie is profoundly silly but is also surprisingly intelligent. I say intelligent because each gag is carefully plotted and it never seems out of context and never looks like an excuse.The result, for each scene, is the following one: everything that could possibly go wrong DOES go wrong. And each plot element that could make the treasure chase easier for one of the contestants hides a trap that cancels the character's excitement and ignites ours.To prove it, just consider this part: Melville (Sid Caesar) and his wife Monica (Edie Adams) are in Santa Rosita well before the others. All they have to do is go to the hardware to get a shovel and a pick. They're told that the owner is downstairs in the basement so they go there. However, the owner was upstairs and he unconsciously locks the basement, confining Melville and Monica into the basement.There are so many comedic moments like this one that we could almost forget that it is a treasure hunt. It's because of the quality of the Roses' (William and Tania) screenplay and of Stanley Kramer's solid direction, which is surprising when you consider that Kramer is a drama expert.The makers of the movie are so talented that they're able to turn a very simple plot into a comic extravaganza that lasts for about 155 minutes and we never notice time's running. And even when they all arrive into the Santa Rosita park, there's about one hour remaining, but surprises occur at every corner and the comic lot goes over again.The different jokes portrayed on screen vary from the unintentional firing of several firework boxes to the very last one (and most classic one): the legendary banana peel on which we stumble. Some of the most unforgettable moments are the tower controller falling and hanging from the tower, Melville and Monica ""jailed"" inside the hardware basement and their numerous escape attempts, Dingy and Benjy trying to fly a plane and the list goes on and on and on...However, the best moments are certainly the climatic triple-car chase and the slapstick finale in a condemned building and on a firetruck's ladder...So, so, so... You want to laugh a lot and you don't know what to rent, buy or watch? Look no further. This hilarious near-celebration of comedy itself is unrelentingly funny from the beginning to the end. Because of the laughs it provides, it makes you understand how the world is mad, mad, mad, mad...",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

But why must Ethel Merman be the butt of all the jokes? Sure she's obnoxious, but she is called ""old bag"" many times when there are CLEARLY many male characters in the film much older than she. If I were her, I would not have accepted such a role. The other women in the film are merely 'eye candy' and get few actually funny lines. If you accept this going into watching it, then you can enjoy it. The humor is a little quaint and dated, but the delivery is still sharp. The music is finely suited to this film, and the action sequences well shot. FYI-This film has both of the male landlords from ""Three's Company"" in it--Norman Fell and Don Knotts.

The film has a basic plot, a motor accident leaves a man dieing to tell the strangers around him that there's a lot of money beneath the ""Big W."" When the man kicks the bucket, literally, the race is on. It's from car chases, to airplane riding, and basement cracking. My all time favorite actor in this film was Phil Silvers who plays the mean hearted Otto who hears about the race and goes for the money on his own. I laughed a lot when he drove his car through a river and it sank! But the best scene out of this three hour film has to be the infamous gas station destruction with Johnathon Winters which starts out with him tied to a station beam and ended with the whole building down in rubble! This film will make you all laugh with family issues with Ethal Merman to trying to fly an airplane with Micky Rooney and Buddy Hacket. And if the main cast isn't enough, wait till you see the cameos we have. Jerry Lewis, The Three stooges, Don Knots, they're all here! I give this comedy classic the big 7 out of 10.

134,tml_pohlak_13,"It's a mad, mad, mad, mad movie indeed...",4,18 July 2009,"Stanley Kramer set out to make the ultimate comedy film in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. It was extremely popular despite the Kennedy assassination just days after its release.How can I summarize it? Simple: things go ""boom"". You'll see explosions, walls crashing, fireworks exploding, ladders going awry, gas stations tumbling down, airplanes malfunctioning... I am reminded of a sequence in 1941 where a Ferris Wheel is attacked by the Japanese, rolling into the water. Technically brilliant? Yes— and not even slightly funny. Kramer makes the error of assuming that every car crash, every explosion, every malfunction, etc. is going to be funny. He was wrong. At 2 hours 41 minutes, the film drags on and on and on.The first, say, 70 minutes of It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World are completely dry. There's practically no humour in it at all. Somewhere around there, two men get into a plane with a pilot who loves to drink. From that point on, the movie is hilarious for about 20-30 minutes. After that, it's dry again until the final hilarious sequence involving a ladder on a fire truck. The movie is devoid of humour for most of its duration—the fact is, an audience can only laugh for so long. Kramer attempts to lure audiences into the cinema (don't forget that ""epics"" were on the rise, as the cinema attempted to win over TV), and forgets about comedy.One more thing: Ethel Merman's screeching gets REALLY annoying. The only payoff about this is in the film's final gag.What is fun about It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World? The answer: spotting the cameos. It's hilarious to see Jerry Lewis run over a hat. Watch for the Three Stooges appearing as firemen. Practically every comedian of the century makes a cameo, and spotting them is fun.The Verdict: It's worth seeing this film only to say that you saw it. Its running time makes the movie drag on and on and on. So much goes on, it's hard to laugh at any of it.Overall Rating: 4/10",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

136,thousandisland,Words cannot summarize this crap.,2,16 September 2002,"SPOILERS AHEAD.1. This isn't funny. There is no clever writing or interesting dialogue. The attempts at humor are overblown, impossible situations that aren't even kitsch-funny. It's not even *silly* fun like 'Rat Race' is. It's just dull and overdone to the point where any possible humor is hammered into the ground, or is totally predictable. The guy is trapped in a basement and we see stacked crates of dynamite and fireworks. You know what's going to happen, but you have to sit through half an hour of lame buildup before it happens. By then, you're half asleep and it isn't funny at all.2. Very little happens. Actually it's like a marathon of really dangerous car stunts. That sounds exciting, but after an hour of watching people run each other off the road and walk away from horrendous crashes and rollovers, it's tiresome. The rest of the movie is drawn out scenes of arguing and fighting: One guy ends up in half-hour brawl with two gas station attendants. Then we have to sit though a screaming argument between a mother and daughter on the phone. Then there is the irritating mother-in-law who yells at people through the whole movie. And there are scenes that idle forever: The two guys have never flown a plane before, but they manage to keep it in the air for an eternity and accomplish a dozen hazardous fly-by stunts that get boring fast. Later we see a bunch of people clinging to the top of a firetruck ladder as it sways back and forth in the air for ten minutes and tosses them off one by one at forty miles an hour into windows and buildings. Of course, they don't die or anything, because these aren't real people. Well, there is a man who can can level a gas station or tear off a car door with his bare hands, but another one with a sledgehammer can't even get out of a basement. (?)3. The ending is predictable. You know exactly what's going to happen to that money as soon as you see these people start up the stairs with it. Then there's the crowd below and the flimsy ladder, so the film provides no other possible outcome. Worse, fully an HOUR before the end, it's clear that Spencer Tracy intends to take the money and try to head down to Mexico. Again, we know it's going to happen, but we have to wait an hour to see it. 4. This movie is WAY too long. You could easily cut an hour from it!5. The characters aren't interesting or different from each other. Some of the guys seem identical, and the mother in law and the police Captain's wife are basically the same person, too: overblown nags with the same voice. Actually all of the characters are either jerks or nags, so you're not rooting for any of them.6. Production value is 0. You can see MANY instances of sharp cuts and background scenery used over and over, and some of the acting is awful. The film itself must have been burned or something, as the color inconsistencies are atrocious and some the frames are even *warped* at the sides. 7. A better, proper rendition of this movie exists. Why rent ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" When you can rent ""RAT RACE""?? Rat Race is actually FUNNY, the characters are distinct and fun to watch, the action moves well, the scenes are varied and colorful, the length is good, and best of all, the ending is actually an unspoiled surprise and brings out morality in the characters.I give ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" an emphatic THUMBS DOWN. One of the worst I've seen in a long time.

137,RussianPantyHog,One of the funniest films ever made.,9,11 January 2005,"This is a massive movie in every sense of the word,an all-star cast (to put it mildly), and hilarious. The plot is very simple (as in all great comedy).Bank robber Smiler Grogan (Jimmy Durante) is released from prison and immediately races off to Southern California to retrieve his ""buried treasure"". The police know what he's up to but they don't know where the loot is so they're tailing him. Smiler crashes his car and is fatally injured but before (literally) ""kicking the bucket"" he tells a group of passers-by who stop to help that $350,000 is theirs for the taking, buried under a big W in Santa Rosita Park. So begins the most hysterical chase in movie history as sheer greed turns a group of upstanding citizens into mindless villains. There are SO many fantastic performances in this film it's hard to pick the best. At least we now know what happened to Sgt Bilko once he left the army! ALL the cast were wonderful. This movie is like a cartoon come-to-life with characters walking away from plane crashes, car wrecks, explosions, electrocution and building collapses. Marvellous! The stunt players deserve particular recognition as they performed brilliant and exceptionally dangerous scenes. In fact, I wish the end-credits could have shown their faces; they were amazing. It's a shame so many of these genius' of comedy are no longer with us but they've left a lasting masterpiece here.

141,rcraig62,An American classic,9,28 August 2003,"If there is such a thing as an epic comedy, a sprawling lavish technocolor landscape of gargantuan humor, It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World is it.  It is truly an American comedy, a junket along the California coast replete with Vegas lounge bums, idle rich drunkards, an overworked and undermanned police department, midwestern goofs, cheesy salesmen and the ever-reliable mean mother-in-law, all swirling in an odd mix while achieving various pinnacles of greed.It all starts when an escaped thief named Smiler Grogan leads the California police on a screechy chase along winding highways only to crash his car off an embankment.  A handful of do-gooders go down into the canyon to try and save him, but it's too late.  His few last words are to reveal to the men a hidden stash of $350,000 buried under a 'Big W' in a park near the Mexican border.  And the chase is on.The principal funnymen (and woman) in the film, Milton Berle, Ethel Merman, Phil Silvers, Sid Caesar, Buddy Hackett, and the vastly underrated Dick Shawn are all extremely good.  But it's maybe Jonathan Winters that steals the movie playing his trademark bumpkin driving a load of furniture to Yuma. His single-handed destruction of the Ray & Irwin garage is one of the true priceless bits in the film. But there are so many great scenes that could be singled out.  Silvers hijacking Don Knotts' car while posing as a federal agent, Spencer Tracy as the harried chief of police feuding with his wife and daughter on the phone. Buddy Hackett and Mickey Rooney flying and landing Jim Backus' private plane in a restaurant, to name a few. And the people who say that there is no good dialogue in the film are dead wrong.  How about Berle's nervous repetition of ""the way he just went sailing out there"", Rooney's ""and every woman for himself"", Selma Diamond's nasal ""What the hell is the Smiler Grogan case?"" or ""when a girl is six-foot-ten, she's bound to have special problems"", Shawn on the phone to his mother ""I was... I was...uh...working."" or Silvers' ""Look me up, I'm in the book, Doctor Zillman!""
Admittedly, the movie is a bit too long and some things probably should have been cut (namely Silvers drowning in his car in the river and Sid Caesar blasting his way out of a locked-up hardware store), which leads to my only real complaint, which is the heavy-handedness of the slapstick. The final ten minutes of the movie, to me, anyway, is very uncomfortable to watch.  I really hate this kind of violent slapstick, with people getting smashed through windows, arms and legs broken. I just don't think it's very funny. Also, I had a relative that died doing some roof work when he got too close to a power line and was killed from the resulting shock, so I can tell you for sure that if you were to fall squarely on a high-tension power line, you would certainly not be bouncing up and down like a trampoline, getting little hand-buzzer-type shocks and going ""oo-oo-oo"".

It was one of the first DVDs I had to have in my collection. It is a movie of another era. As the technology of movies changes ever more rapidly, the special effects are more streamlined nowadays and the story suffers and takes a backseat. I don't care how funny some parts of 'Rat Race' or 'Million Dollar Mystery' or 'Scavenger Hunt' (see it if you can find it) are, this movie did it first. A cross-country search for a fortune (well, $350,000, anyway) awaits the lucky folks who get to the loot before the others is now a movie genre all its own. [Aside to other posters:  its possessive; and  it's = it is; there is no plainer way to put it.] But this was the film that did it before anyone else, crudely edited as some people say. I disagree that it was edited poorly. I think the editing achievement for its time is remarkable. There can never be such a cast of famous actors assembled these days that could cost under a million dollars because too many egos would be involved, so 'MMMMW' is a time capsule in addition to being a lot of fun. The impatient, low attention-span viewers born after 1987 or so are too hopped up on caffeine (since Starbucks has taken over worldwide) to sit and enjoy a movie that takes some thought. Yes, I said thought. If you really pay attention to the dialogue instead of just getting the gist of the exposition, you'll hear that there is more to what's being said than on the surface. I know this seems at first glance like a throwaway, goofball movie, but there is a lot of commentary about how life in middle-class America was in the early '60s. To those who find the movie repetitive and boring and long and unfunny, please give it another try. Some day when you are laid up in bed with a cold or a broken leg and you have nowhere to go in a hurry, pop this in and give it a second chance. The secret to enjoying it is to have the time available to watch it, without your cell phone or pager going off and without thinking about the film's running time. After reading the negative comments here, I felt obliged to stick up for this raucous, side-splitting film that you shouldn't have to struggle to watch. Let it wash over to you, like the event that it is. If you don't have three hours to devote to its viewing, go watch 'My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding' instead. It's half as long. In these modern times, it is nearly impossible to keep your thoughts focused on something like a silly movie without your mind bouncing synapses off the inside of your skull to distraction. But you have to remember that this movie was made forty years ago when there wasn't as much need to worry and plan and react to that which is not immediately in front of you. As I said earlier, if you project yourself back in time to when life was a bit simpler and the world was slightly less complicated, you will laugh.

Milton Berle, Mickey Rooney, Sid Caesar,Buddy Hackett to name just a few. These were the classic actors, actors that really loved their jobs and showed it.

Meanwhile, the police are hot on their tails witnessing just how ""Mad"" these people really are. It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is a chase comedy, each of the 14 people involved goes through a horrible yet hilarious experience to get to the buried loot. The characters are a wimpy man J.

A lot of people say this movie is not so funny, and overly slapstick. But what they don't realize is this movie was one of the greatest comedies of all. Plus this comedy is very clean, no swearing, there are two scenes where a woman is dancing in a swimsuit and bikini though it is only shown twice and for small moments. All in all it's a clean comedy and very funny, what I don't understand is why do comedies today have all the filth in them, to me that doesn't make it funny. If your in the right mood, you will laugh with this movie.It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is a classic, nothing will ever come close to it. They did do a movie called ""Rat Race"" that is like this, but I have not seen it yet. 10/10 stars for ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World.""",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
147,rchrdshelt,Brilliant classic comedy,10,5 July 2004,"This film is absolutely hilarious. I saw it first when I was about 5 and only liked it because of its fantastic car chases but when I actually got it on video and watched it again I just couldn't stop laughing. The cast is excellent with plenty of famous legends in there and plenty of brilliant cameos as well. The plot is so simple and it seems so easy: A dying gangster who literally kicks the bucket, tells 8 motorists that there's $350,000 200 miles away buried under a big ""W"". He's giving it to them. So basically the motorists try to come to an agreement on how they will split the money between them, but in the end it becomes every man for himself and whoever gets there first gets it all. Thats preety much it. And yet, basically everything that could go wrong does. All the characters have countless numbers of problems along their way there. Its an all out war and they won't let anything stand in their way, but to be fair who would when there's 350,000 on offer! Anyway, many people said this film was too long but if you ask me the length didn't bother me at all and in fact I found it better as they were able to fit more gags and celebrities in. The last 30 minutes is my favourite and the ending is my favourite of all time. I won't spoil it for you but I can tell you that when you're watching it, it really does make you think more about the title of the film.The Script and Direction is brilliant but the best is the Score which should have won an Oscar. It is one of the greatest in film history. Enough said. I was also very impressed with the spectacular car chases and crashes which are done superbly for a film that was made 40 years ago and with such a tiny budget. When you compare the re-make ""Rat Race"" to this film it doesn't even come close and as far as I'm concerned even though Rat Race is a very funny film the ending is terrible compared to this one.Anyway thats enough of me I give this film 10/10 Get up and go and rent or buy it now!",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
148,Bigweight66,BIG classic comedy of the 1960's,10,3 April 2021,"A group of motorists accidentally learn about a hidden stash of cash, and they soon want a slice of the action. This movie quickly becomes a road trip movie about greed and human behavior, with lots of laughs along the way. The motorists are an assorted bunch of colourful characters and oddballs. Personally they see themselves as doing the right thing, but they have problems with the other greedy motorists in the race for the cash. By todays standards the hidden cash could be considered a rather small amount, to cause so much chaos by a large group of people. But in 1963 it was a huge amount and enough to live very happily ever after. The motorists find themselves in some very difficult situations, again with lots of laughs. The motorists and their erratic behavior become of an interest to the police.The casting is an absolute who's who of stars from that time period, with lots of fun cameo appearances. With Spencer Tracy, Ethel Merman, Jimmy Durante, Mickey Rooney and many more its an amazing gathering of talent. This movie comes from a much simpler and nicer era, and this really shines through in the movie.I first saw this movie around the early 1970's as a young child, and I have loved it ever since.

Except: it's very interesting to see that one performer (and one only!) can actually make comedy with no material, and that's Jonathan Winters. There's hardly a good line in it (amazing that the same William Rose wrote the wonderful, charming ""Genevieve"") and the endless car chases become a crashing bore after the first -- well, soon. Ethel Merman, bless her heart, is fascinating to watch: she gives it her all (as she always does), and her ""all"" is about ten times the size of anyone else's. Otherwise, what's most interesting, perhaps, is the time capsule quality, particularly if you happen to be interested in American musical theater, for, oddly enough, a huge number of the great (and so misused) comics in this picture happen to have been in musicals at about this time. So (to clarify my point) one can see just what these guys looked like at the time of their (generally only) musicals. Buddy Hackett was about to do ""I Had a Ball,"" Phil Silvers was coming off ""Do Re Mi,"" this is Merman just after ""Gypsy"", Dick Shawn just about to go into ""Fade Out Fade In,"" and Sid Caesar at the time of ""Little Me."" Otherwise: what WAS the point? Amazingly, this wildly overlong comedy apparently originally clocked in at FIVE HOURS! -- which just goes to show that Stanley Kramer's sense of ""comedy"" is pretty much equal to his sense of ""drama."" The one fairly amusing (if stomach-churning) scene is the final L.A. Plaza scene, a more elaborate (though nowhere near as funny -- is 10 men hanging from a building funnier than one? No.) version of the brilliant Harold Lloyd's ""Safety Last."" Even Saul Bass's titles seem labored. Ernest Gold's score is pretty (and spectacularly played by no less than the L.A.

All of the greatest comedians appear (though most in cameos). Half the fun is picking them all out. Spencer Tracy has the lead as the disgruntled police detective who takes more than a passing interest in the money as well.

From first to last, this movie is terrific. I have seen it so many times (and so has my family) that we have dozens of standing jokes/gags in our collective repertoire derived from it. Two things make it great: (1) the script, which is just crackling with fabulously hilarious lines for all the actors; and (2) the cast which, without doubt, is the greatest comic cast ever assembled in the history of the civilized world.It's so hard to single out individual performances when they were all so good, but...Spencer Tracy: his portrayal of the henpecked, tired, ready-to-retire civil servant is phenomenally realistic.Ethel Merman: can you even begin to imagine someone else in that role? Jonathan Winters: the big sweet guy you can't help but like.This film is the gold standard by which every comedy is judged; very few even come close, and there isn't one that has surpassed it.

152,Whythorne,"Dated, overrated and full of dead space",1,30 September 2008,"The overblown title of this film gives a clue as to what appears to be the creative and pretentious intention of its makers, and that was no doubt to make the most ambitious, epic ""comedy"" with the biggest comedic cast ever.Unfortunately, somewhere in all that effort, they forgot to include a script that would actually elicit laughter.""Mad etc. World"" attempted to utilize a ""bigger is better"" approach with the misguided notion that that approach alone would guarantee hilarity. Unfortunately it does not. Much is made over the cast, which was well padded with cameo roles. Apparently, just the appearance of a Don Knotts, or the Three Stooges, or a Jerry Lewis, et al was supposed to be cause for laughter, so no attempt at actually giving the cameo comedians funny lines or utilizing them in a clever way was a consideration.Not only are the attempts at humor lame and unfunny, but a heck of a lot of time in this 3 hour movie is nothing but dead space, with a lot of film footage spent on the cast getting into and out of automobiles, transitioning from point A to point B, and chases that are neither cleverly choreographed nor funny. It makes me shudder to think that the director had to reluctantly cut this mess down from an original running time of FIVE hours!Anyway, no sense in beating this dead horse, it's not even worth the commentary. Suffice to say, the final scene perfectly captures the essence of this film. Ethel Merman slips on a banana peel, and the rest of the cast immediately launches into forced and extremely fake laughter, as if trying to ram down the viewer's throat what he or she is supposed to find hilarious. If that brand of humor, completely devoid of anything subtle, clever or creative is what makes you laugh, then by all means don't miss this one.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

154,tohu,A deliberately 'silly' film with a glorious ending.,8,21 May 2006,"This is one of my favourite films, and though I have seen it countless times, it never fails to raise a smile on my face whenever I see it again. However, if this is not a contradiction, I am very aware of its flaws and I can actually understand that some people don't like it.If you have an interest in the history of how the popular film and TV entertainment business developed in the 1950s and 60s, you will appreciate the sheer scale of the array of stars that Kramer managed to bring together in this film. Almost everybody in the film - and there are lots of them - was famous to some degree as a comic performer in their own right.If such things mean nothing to you, then you will already be missing one of the central joys of the film, which is the unique sight of seeing these people in the same place at the same time, the way they play off each other, each trying to outdo each other and come off as the lead. It is a tribute to Kramer's skill that no one actor manages to emerge as such at the expense of the rest - apart from Spencer Tracy, who was clearly the biggest 'star' of all going in, and whose class does shine through, despite the fact that his physical decline is sadly apparent at times here.The rest of them bounce on to the screen playing variations of the characters that made them famous in the first place. So the Phil Slvers character is basically Sergeant Bilko in a suit; Peter Falk is a bad-tempered Columbo in a taxi; Mickey Rooney, as usual, is the street-smart wise guy on the make; Terry Thomas the eccentric Englishman and Ethel Merman the loudmouthed mother-in-law from hell. They play to type. But so what? To criticise the lack of originality in casting and scripting is to miss the point, I think. This is, and was always meant to be, a silly film, the central purpose of which was to ask what would happen if all your favourite TV characters and film clichés wound up together in the same plot. How would they react to each other? It may be that this - a strength at the time, when these characters were universally recognisable and well-loved - is a weakness today because 21st century audiences do not necessarily have this basis of understanding of these characters. But in fact I personally think it still works as a basic funny 'plot and gag' film anyway.There is a case for saying it is over-long, but for me it never drags, and as long as the context as explained here hasn't put you off, it is worth watching the whole way through, if only to enhance your enjoyment of the glorious last 15 minutes or so.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

This film may not have invented the cameo appearance, (See around the world in 80 days, released in 1956 for that)but this movie sure has what could be the biggest cast of comedians and character actors ever in one movie at one time! This movie is hard to explain, you just have to see it! There are other posters here on IMDb who tell what the story is about.Yes, it's a really dumb, stupid, silly slapstick sort of movie, but it is a comedy treasure.It's so cool to see so many great stars who have passed away. I am a pop culture fan, and this movie is one of the all-time toppers! Having Spencer Tracy as the film's main star still makes me shake my head. I guess he just wanted to do a light comedy. He worked with director Stanley Kramer a total of four times in his film career, so maybe it was a favor to Kramer for Tracy to do this film.If you're a fan of slapstick, comedians and comic actors, as well as classic character actors, you will probably enjoy this silly spectacular! In the 1970's when I was a kid, this film was shown about once a year on a Sunday night on Network TV here in the USA, and we always watched it every time it was on. It was a tradition like the yearly viewing of The Wizard Of Oz.In my 43 years on earth, I have seen this movie at least 15 times, maybe 20.

Even ""Dr. Strangelove,"" where the fate of the world hangs in the balance and several plot lines unfold, seems restrained compared to this sprawling but light-hearted showbiz extravaganza.Starring everyone, featuring everything, unfolding more or less in real time, and clocking in at an absurdly overlong 161 minutes in the restored version (still short of the incomprehensible 188-minute original cut), ""IAMMMMW"" is Hollywood at its most...well...Hollywood.

But the sheer length causes it to drag heavily for a while after the intermission (YES! INTERMISSION! IN A COMEDY!) before it picks up for the climax, bringing it down to a strong 7 (7.5, maybe?).

Watching the film to spot all of these stars and cameos makes viewing more enjoyable. Practically every big name vaudeville and TV comedy star at the time is in this clamoring for screen time and all involved in an epic chase for $350,000. The amount of the money is the only item that dates the film because the visual zaniness is timeless and still exciting to watch. I don't see how an updated version of this movie can be produced today with stars' salaries being what they are.

The plus point to this film is the cast expanded as the chase to find the loot pushed people into situations they did not expect. No lasting friendships were formed with this dysfunctional group of people. I found myself siding with the truck driver who was screwed over at every point of his chase, he could not even secure a place in the taxis without fighting and pushing his way in. He and Terry Thomas were the only characters to have sacrificed something. The others were just going about their day.The film should be applauded for showing the heat and sweat of a desert road and the lack of over editing which kills the pace of modern films. Some scenes were just left static as the motley group of characters argued and failed to decide on a plan.Just watch the film and it will deliver some laughs for a near 60 year old blockbuster with a cast that maybe meant something at the time, but are now long forgotten on the whole.

This sets the tone for the greatest slapstick epic ever invented and watching a new kind of role for the late-great Spencer Tracy is just one of the benefits you reap in renting this film.  I was merely a 10 year old child at a slumber party when I first viewed this laugh-a-minute comedy and it remains a nice weekend rental today.    Who would have ever thought that a trip to Santa Rosita Park to retrieve some money hidden under a big W could cause so many problems and so many disputes among normally civilized people?  The premise of taking a road trip is by the books fare but what sets the film apart is the whole idea of the Big W, very unique indeed.    Not enough words can be spoken about the Gene Hackman or Tom Hanks of his time Spencer Tracy.  The role he undertakes here is actually quite unique. He is suddenly the bad guy who wants just as much as anybody to get over to Santa Rosita and get a shot at the money.  The three-way phone conversation between he and his wife and daughter Billy Sue is ingenious.  The role is just so different from the roles he typically played opposite real-life love Katharine Hepburn in Adam's Rib and Desk Set.  The role of the ultimate bitch on wheels mother-in-law is portrayed effortlessly by the gifted Ethel Merman.  And the way her mama's boy of a son Sylvester played by Dick Shawn cries because he's afraid of what's happening to his mama is the most hilarious thing you'll ever see.  Is the film too long?  If it was up to me it would have gone on for at least a half-hour more.  Just being given the chance to see so many great comedians on the screen at one time is enough to wish for a sequel for this one, something I normally despise.  For those that truly hate the length and cannot appreciate the talent of the comedians in this film that is truly a shame.

The story of this film could be told in 40 minutes. 210 minutes is an oversized exaggeration. Everything in this film is oversized, and the jokes are so unnecessary (most of the jokes in this movie are not even fun) that more than 85% of jokes and fun times are forgotten even before the start of the third act.

It's enjoyable throughout, and, not coincidentally, has some realistic observations on human nature. The situations and events are OTT, and never intended to be taken seriously, but, like all the best comedy, the commentary on people is right there in front of you.The cast list is amazing. It includes a vast number of stars from the time (1963). All the main characters are stars in their own right, and many others appear throughout the movie in cameo roles. If, like the intended audience, you recognise the stars, this will undoubtedly add to your enjoyment. However, I suspect many people today will recognise only a very few actors (as did I, I am ashamed to admit). But that's OK  this movie shines on its own merits.The plot line is simple, and the fun comes from watching the characters chasing their dream. It's a wild ride, and every moment is immensely enjoyable. The acting is perfect, as is the comedic timing. Every scene has meaning (in the context of a fun film) and moves the story along - with a single exception. Whilst watching, I was puzzled by one scene which focused on three firemen for a few seconds. It was only later that I discovered that these were the Three Stooges, who I have only heard of and never seen. No doubt this scene will be amusing to those familiar with the Stooges, but for anyone who doesn't know them  this is the reason for the scene's existence!Some people find ""Mad World"" hilarious throughout. I am not one of them, but that's no bad thing. One can only laugh so long, and a production that strives for constant hysterical hilarity quickly becomes tedious and dull. For me, this movie represents the perfect blend for a comedic movie. It gave me some laugh-out-loud moments, evenly distributed throughout its run, frequent smiles and chuckles, and constant amusement. I can give no higher acclaim than to say that when I saw the film I was suffering from an extremely bad cold, but forgot this completely and enjoyed the film thoroughly.I approached ""Mad World"" with a neutral mind. Frankly, I was quite prepared to read a newspaper whilst it was on if it didn't hold my attention  or even to stop playback and press the Erase button. However, it more than held my attention; it proved an immensely enjoyable experience. I hadn't looked at the runtime prior to viewing, so had no idea that it was such a long movie. In fact, I didn't realise how long it was until it was over. I started watching in the afternoon, and was astonished to find that it was evening at the end. I hadn't glanced at the clock once, and if I had thought about it I would have guessed the movie lasted ninety minutes or so. For me, there really can't be a greater testament to how good this movie is.In summary, this is a fun film throughout. It is peopled with likable characters played to perfection. The viewer wants them all to succeed. There are some nice, pretty girls to admire (I love the fashions on show  very feminine, and very flattering), and the enjoyment never stops. ""Mad World"" is very different to so much of the ""comedy"" being produced at present, and is all the better for it. There is no cynicism, sarcasm, ridicule, sex, swearing or nastiness - and no politically correct message. It's just a fun movie that encapsulates much that is real by placing normal people in an extraordinary situation and having them behave in an extraordinary manner.Highly enjoyable, and highly recommended.9/10",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

This has some of the funniest people who ever lived. Milton Berle. Sid Caeser. Buddy Hackett. Jonathan Winters. Carl Reiner. Jerry Lewis. Jack Benny. Though I would have liked to see Bob Hope, George Burns, Jackie Gleason, Lucille Ball, and maybe even Johnny Carson, this movie was still downright funny. I mean, when you see Milton Berle and Terry-Thomas doing a fist fight, it's so dang funny. When the biggest names in comedy fall from the building, that can't be beat. When Jonathan Winters tore down the gas station with his bare hands, I was chuckling with delight. And even though he was in it for only a minute, Jack Benny's scene was still hilarious.

What I do remember was the poor state of the film, some of the scenes were like watching through a blizzard, but this was all too typical of the film industry in the seventies. As regards the film itself, it seems to have been made by people with no sense of comic timing. It does have some good ideas in it, but they are done to death. If only someone had taken a pair of scissors and drastically cut it down. There are some talented people in this movie, such a pity that they don't get to properly show off their skills.

In the decades since then I must have seen it at least half a dozen more times, and still enjoy it - but from a different perspective today. This was maybe the greatest assemblage of comedy talent ever put together in one movie, even if it isn't the greatest comedy due to a pretty thin story line. There are actors in it, like Buster Keaton and Ben Blue, who started in silent movies. Many of the others came out of the vaudeville circuits. The characters are all great, with some wonderful cameos, such as those by Jack Benny and Jerry Lewis. A personal favorite is Jonathan Winters portrayal of the put-upon moving truck driver.While the story line is thin, it's still a funny movie from beginning to end.

Made in 1963, it showcases one of the best casts ever assembled for a movie, and uses all of them incredibly well.When a group of strangers finds themselves helping a dying man after he ran his car off the road, they have no choice to believe his final words about $350,000 being buried under ""a big W"" in Santa Rosita Park. Thus starts the mad dash for the money, and nearly three hours later, the story is resolved.Despite its very long running time, ""World"" never loses your attention. There is so much comedy here, and it happens at such a frequent pace that it is impossible for any scene to be slow. The filmmakers did an amazing job of keeping each subplot straight as we follow the adventures of all the people who are in the hunt for the dough.There are so many standouts in this movie that it is impossible to point them all out without forgetting someone. The highlights for me were Jonathan Winters and Phil Silvers, as well as Sid Caesar. Unbelievable comedic talent in this film.If you haven't seen this movie yet, by all means rent it.

It is slow, ponderous, unfunny, traffics in stereotypes and mugging for laughs, and guilty of misusing the enormous comedic talent at its disposal. I like Stanley Kramer's work, which is why this movie was especially disheartening. He has absolutely no sense of pace or timing, the script is overlong by about 75 pages, and his leads are almost painstakingly kept from being funny the way they know how.

182,gatsby06,A time capsule,9,24 June 2007,"Let's face it, ultimately this is a collection of funny skits than a coherent movie. And it is conceivable that competent, less famous actors could have still made this movie work.But what makes this movie immortal is its immortal cast. It is a time capsule of 20th century comedy. It is a joy watching it just to see masters at work.This movie is the definition of a ""blockbuster,"" a movie crammed with great stars. You couldn't fit many more in if you tried.A younger generation might not appreciate this, and might not find the movie as amusing. But they should watch it, if for no other reason, to attain basic cultural literacy.On the other hand, it is interesting to contrast this movie with The Russians are Coming! The Russians are Coming! It is also a semi-blockbuster, though probably for a different reason: that so many fine actors wanted to avail themselves of the opportunity to thumb their noses at the anti-communist censors of the 1950s, I bet.But what made The Russians stronger is that it was not non-stop slapstick comedy. In Mad, about the only sane person is Spencer Tracy, and he is heavily outweighed by the insanity. In The Russians, there is more balance to contrast with the humor. And so I find I can put the movie on a day after watching it and still laugh at the scenes. I suspect once every year or three is enough for Mad.At the time it came out, Mad was a must see movie. It still is. Go make some popcorn, don't think too hard, and just enjoy it for what it is. And maybe read up on IMDb and elsewhere about the background of these great actors.BTW, I happened to read Sid Caesar's autobiography, ""Caesar's Hours,"" in which he talks about the filming of Mad.

It may be the funniest movie ever made but that's not surprising considering the comedic talents and the script they had to work with. 
One of the funniest scenes for me are the ones in the control tower.  Paul Ford is hilarious (""What the hell's wrong with this wire?"") in his brief part.

185,Fred_Mopkopf,It's a mad mad mad mad review ...,9,4 June 2021,"..not. This is an old film that has aged really, really, really, really well. Which of course doesn't prevent it from getting some very impertinent negative reviews here. Granted, nobody's able to switch his brain back to 1963 - I can't at any rate, as I was born way later. But if one has seen a lot of movies, one should be able to at figure out at what point of the scale something stood quality-wise at the time. IAMMMMW arguably stood very high. You must not forget that saying something like 'Grogan crashed in his chips' back then had the level of coolness we nowadays find in stuff like 'Modern Family'. Another example: Grogan actually kicking the bucket when he dies. This was an all-new and hilarious gag at the time. If you can't appreciate this and get into that vibe, such films are not for you. If you are able to do so however, you will find that IAMMMMW is indeed one of the best comedies of all time. So, on a side note, if you're not generally able to watch an older film while appreciating the circumstances it was made under - e.g. The period with its world view and possibilities - then just don't write a review about it. Complaining about unfashionable clothes, old jokes (that were new at the time), decorations, TV sets, cars and the way people behaved and spoke is not gonna get uns anywhere.IAMMMMW is built on the foundation of a truly great ensemble cast, with of course Spencer Tracy as Culpepper at the core. We all know him for his dramatic roles, but here he combines his well-known fatherly vibes with a wonderful quirkiness that alone makes the film a treat to watch. Again it shows how brilliant an actor he was - always being realistic, never overacting. No wonder it was Tracy who said: 'Acting is the easiest thing in the world. Just don't get caught doing it.' He knew his trade.My personal favourite in the film is Terry-Thomas. Maybe it's just me, but watching him and hearing him speak alone fascinates the hell out of me. He could read from a phone book as far as I'm concerned.In terms of comedy and comedic timing there is much to learn from this film: One of the highlights must be the shot when Benjy and Culpepper are looking at each other while the others are digging. Again, it's a simple classic, but it's well executed and timeless as such. Seen a thousand times again since then and still effective. Another notable scene is the one with Sylvester Marcus and the dancing girl with the deadpan look. Who in his right mind could have conceived a character like her back in 1963?And then there is a technical aspect: The film looks brilliant. Even today. I'd seen the 1080P version for the first time the other day, and I was taken aback how sharp the image was, which always means that the sharpness was already there on the negative. But some obvious back projection aside and some wobbly tracking shots, the film is not a terrible strain on the eye, as Terry-Thomas would say. The vistas, the colours, the sets, the framing - just great.For me, the film's only drawback is the ending with the ladder; that's the only part where everything really gets childish.The overused saying 'They don't make em anymore' is right. They tried with 'Rat Race' and didn't succeed. Maybe it's time for another try. Until then, re-watch IAMMMMW from time to time.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
186,egasulla,What a waste of time... a whole lot of it.,2,21 September 2017,"This hideous thing lasts more than three hours, and allegedly exceeded production costs by a lot. I guess an unfortunate way the producers chose to cut the bleeding was to hire the script writers for a regular 90 minutes movie. Therefore, the dialogue of the second half of the movie consists mostly of inarticulated shouting and yelling. Some of the many (way too many!) actors in the cast do OK with this, such as Ethel Merman who made a career out of overacting. But people like Sid Caesar, Milton Berle or -most of all- Spencer Tracy are completely out of place here.Stanley Kramer directed a grand total of one comedy -this one. It's not difficult to see why. Speaking about his ""serious"" movies he said ""Instead of relying on star names, we pinned our faith in stories that had something to say.""

Before watching this, I am so skeptic about film 3 hours length but actually it didn't feeling bothering beacuse of consistent pacing and great actions from all the cast memebers.From opening song and credit animation, all the things in films are mostly crazy and chaotic but in a good way. (I always had hugh love and affection for comedy film with big insanity and craziness)
It is in 60s and all these plane and car stunts presented in film are really impressive. I can't imagine how they accomplished to pull such a great job with stunts.On the negative side - Some jokes and humor didn't land on me and most of them seems rather silly but compared to what a thrill and entertainment I got from this, it is forgivable.The story is about group of men chasing for 350,000 $ buried in Santa Rosita State Park, after overhearing the last words of a dying ex-convict man on highway. And along the way police force become involved in the search too.Suddenly the plot reminded me of Rat Race but it is stated that those kind of a comedic search for money featuring an ensemble cast were directly influenced by this.My favorite part would be the whole ending, fire ladder scene seems so cartoonish but it turned out to be pure comedic gold.
Ending at hospital with everyone laughing feels so satisfying and heartfel but feels a little bit sad for Spencer Tracy tho.

In fact, he does exactly the same thing in THE PRODUCERS as LSD. It is unbelievable that the audience in the film could be turned around from hating ""Springtime for Hitler and Germany,"" due to the ""comedic"" nonsense of Shawn to thinking he was hysterically funny. The reality is, in THE PRODUCERS and in this classic, you can't wait for him to get off the screen.Sorry if this offends any Shawn fans, but seems I am not the only one of this opinion -- none of my friends who are avid fans of IAMMMMMW find him remotely palatable.This epic certainly would, like it has for so many others, get my 10.... if it weren't for this no-talent Dick Shawn.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

It was a far departure and the first comedy directed by Stanley Kramer, known for serious academy award nominated films like ""Inherit the Wind,"" ""Judgement of Nurenberg,"" ""The Defiant Ones, "" and ""Guess Who is coming to Dinner."" The story begins in a huge traffic jam caused by careless driver Smiler Grogan played by Jimmy Durante.

And, what I would really like to mention and give props to are the stunts. Next time you watch the movie pay attention to the countless stunts that had to be performed from the simple kick of the bucket (was a stuntman, not Durante's leg you see), to the complex and dangerous winding road chases. That no one was killed is probably one of the most astonishing things about the movie.

199,johnhenrik,An OK collection of somewhat funny scenes.,5,24 March 2007,"I'm amazed at how many absolute fans there are to this movie. I was young when I first saw it on TV. I've seen it a few times since and when I do, I try to analyze what it is that makes it so popular. It is a slapstick piece and you never stop getting the gags thrown at you throughout it's ""3 hours"".... Now I'll admit that it is somewhat funny a lot of the time, but that's because you have some of the greatest comedians in the early years of audio/visual entertainment. Several of them were around before televisions existed. And these ""were"" the early years. Most older people from that time period remembered the days of no television and many of them still had no TV. Some of the slapstick humor in this movie was new to a lot of people, even though much of it came from the silent movie era. But, that was because not that many people had seen a decent number of silent movies. In any case, these comedians were able to take a simplistic script and shape it in a funny way. I never laughed really hard during this movie though, because the jokes are not new (even back then) and it takes too long to get to the point on most of them. Also, certain gags are stretched for way too long. Now it's fun to watch certain scenes, like the airplane flying (which is one of the most impressive flight scenes ever), but it's just not really funny. Dick Shaun is funny no matter what he's doing. As far as I know, he was a 'one-trick-pony', but he's hilarious to watch. Actually, most of the comedians had their plus sides, but the script limited them greatly. The cameos are a nice part of the movie, but that's about it. The movie is just way too long. I grew up in Southern California and I love to see the scenery of the desert and the ocean highways, the towns, and the buildings (so much is not shown in movies these days because of release forms that need to be signed). But there's no deep characterization or plot structure in this movie. That's one part of this work that makes ""3 hours"" a damn long time. Of course, how can you develop a character from a plot that can be described in a few words, ""Dying man tells where to get lots of money. Everybody's greedy side comes out"" - in a funny sort of way. What I can say that's good about this movie, is that many of the scenes have their funny little moments. But, as I've read from other reviewers here, almost everything is quite predictable. The moral lesson at the end of the movie actually hurts it considerably. I can think (as many people could) of many other possible ways to build to a climax that could make this movie infinitely better. One of these ways is definitely to shorten the movie. I would say that this is kind of like a SNL show. It has some skits that are funny, but there's not a real story that connects them.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

The overture with its lyrics haunts me whenever I hear it. It haunts me because this film released a mere 2 weeks before JFK's assassination is a true testament to the human condition as well as rejoicing in a kinder gentler time of life. If JFK's death was the turning point in life for those of us over 50 then this movie is also a turning point. It was perhaps the last movie that gave us real slapstick schtick comedy and no PC worries. The cast is classic because every actor in it remains well thought of in our memory. Great movie stars who either continued their careers on the silver screen or made the Golden Age of TV what it became. It is a nostalgic piece a throwback to that by gone movie called the"" screwball comedy"" I first saw it as a 9 year old kid. My dad never took us to the movies so I saw it with my friend and his dad at a local theater.

Just wading through some of the previous write-ups nauseated me, because I have both fond memories of this film AND understand the where, when and why's of it's filming.You just can't impose your late 1990's standards / later on a film like this. It is a product of it's own time frame and should be viewed as such. Would you criticise the 1933 Invisible Man on poor special effects ? The 1954 Dambusters on the bouncing bomb scenes and ultimately the dam destruction scenes ? What about the original Terminator ? Looking a bit crap now isn't it but nevertheless people still watch it in their droves. The point is that The Mad +3 World tried to make a point that ultimately stranded it in 1963 - and that is exactly the era in which you should judge it ! Do you really think all those stars were in it for the money ? Hum...... This is Hollywood after all, ok let's just say that there was a GENERAL feeling that they were trying their real best and believed the end product would further their careers or cap an already successful one. There are just too many big names in this for all to have been idiots.A further line of critique seems to be the running time. Well if you think it too long then just switch off ! Is that too hard ? If you went out for a meal with coffee and the coffee was too hot would you continue to drink it ? Let it and yourself cool off. I just cannot believe a line of moaning that includes something like ""3 hours of my life wasted"".If you enjoy stand up comedy on a variety show then watch this film. That is a broad analogy. If you want the latest blockbuster - that is always better than the previous blockbuster - then don't bother watching. This film now has it's own little niche as a historical document and doesn't need the mobile phone generation to put it down.  I give this no less than 9/10",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

Despite pratfalls providing 90% of the laughs, this film also chronicles how greed supersedes all other considerations in the lives of a group of motorists who attend the death of a long-incarcerated thief, whose final words indicate the hiding place of his spoils. Performances by such venerated comic talent as Milton Berle, Ethel Merman, Buddy Hackett...just read the cast list, re-numerating them here is redundant...keep the characters' escalating frustration and in-fighting both believable and hilarious. Auto enthusiasts and road picture fans will find additional thrills as scores of vintage cars and trucks are raced, mangled and destroyed across the two-lane blacktop that dominated southeastern California before the domination of the superhighway.Best of all, the laughs are for everyone. There is no objectionable language or adult situations of which to be wary, so this is a perfect alternative to contemporary animated fare, and a great way to introduce children to the idea that vintage entertainment can still be fun.

To me, though, there is no greater feeling than knowing that you have done something that makes others smile and feel better. That's why I have spent my entire career in entertainment -- as a comedy writer, actor, filmmaker and producer. That said, I can tell you this: ""It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" is nothing less than the greatest comedy motion picture of all time. Once the film begins -- and its magic has me within the first three notes of the opening theme --you are swept into the STORY and the delightful mix of idiosyncratic characters whose dateless blend of human foibles bring it so vividly to life. It's the perfect combination of comic characters, a brilliantly concocted and unfolded plot and ACTION that's both funny AND exciting. I think my all-time fondest wish would have been to be involved in making ""IAMMMMW"" -- but unfortunately they didn't cast too many 12 year olds from Armonk, New York. It did inspire me to make my first slapstick comedy short, however, using my Dad's 8mm movie camera. There'll never be another IAMMMW; too many of today's comics rely on crudity and foul-mouthed insults -- and, of course, with few exceptions, have little grounding in physical comedy. Yes, it would have been great if Ernie Kovacs had lived to participate and if some of the stars given but parts had expanded roles (Buster Keaton, Stan Freberg, etc.). Stan Laurel would have been an exceptionally welcome addition (had he not turned down the chance). But at least we get to see Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Jonathan Winters and others at their absolute best. Others have tried to duplicate the IAMMMMW formula and all have come up short.

This movie has it all... Suspense, drama, slapstick (sorry, no nudity, bad language, or adult situations). There is some violence, but it's all in fun. I can't think of a movie made since, or before, which has the star quality of IAMMMMW. It's difficult to say whether viewers younger than about 40 can really understand the importance of this epic, since they don't see the cast as giants of their time.

It's difficult to pick a favorite bit, Phil Silvers conning Don Knotts into thinking he's a secret agent, Jonathan Winters demolishing a gas station, Ethel Merman taking her loud-mouth persona over the top, they're all great! But I have to give the nod to Dick Shawn as a mentally-challenged beach bum who goes crazy when he thinks someone's messing with his Momma.

The second was a black cab driver falling off a building and landing in the arms of a statue of Abraham Lincoln. (Bad. too, Yes, i know). Also the stunt driving (and flying) was spectacular.

Now my husband and two grade-school age sons have already sat through it twice and it was a wonderful experience, the four or us just laughing and laughing for well over two hours. It's incredibly broad, loud, long, fast, crude and filled with hilariously repulsive characters.The plot is thus: at the scene of a car crash, a dying gangster reveals the location of his stolen fortune to a group of strangers standing by the road. This motley group of ordinary folks go absolutely nuts on a greed-driven slapstick pursuit of the loot.To me, Dick Shawn was the stand-out as a early 60s-style beach bum/hipster. (""You're buggin' me, man!"") I loved seeing the usually noble Spencer Tracy as a crooked cop and hen-pecked husband tangling with the unforgettably whiny phone persona of Selma Diamond. And it's great to see the comic talents of the era strut their stuff -- Milton Berle, Sid Ceasar, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Ethel Merman, Phil Silvers, Jim Backus and more. Many of these guys were New York- Jewish-Catskill types and their type of sharp humor has virtually vanished today.

I have watched this every year for the past 25 years and I still laugh out loud. This is a great collage of the best comics of the time and of history. What other movie ever had a lineup like this? I don't know what these other reviewers are thinking! The acting is so real and the chemistry is so great it is unbelievable. The opening scene at the car accident is priceless as dying driver Jimmy Durante rambles about hidden dough to the five accident witnesses (Berle, Winters, Hackett, Rooney, Ceasar) that are standing by him. His thoughts become murky and calls Sid Ceasar his Aunt. Then Durante takes one last breath and kicks a bucket down the ravine. Jonathan Winters stands up and says, ""That guy's dead!"". Detective (Norman Fell) comes onto the scene and asks if Durante had anything to say before he died. (Silence). Then Fell asks if Durante was dead when the others arrived on the scene. The five men can't come up with words because they don't want to let the secret out of the bag. Then Buddy Hackett answers his question and says, ""Practically"". They team up a few miles later along the side of the road to figure out how to split the money up between them when they find it in Santa Rosita. Sid Ceasar proposes different ways to split the money up which are so hilariously unreasonable and ridiculous that it comes off like an Abbott & Costello routine. The others are completely confused and offended (especially Winters) and finally agree to ""Every man for himself!!!"". There are many stories in this movie that are hilarious! Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett stuck up in the air not knowing how to fly a plane (after pilot Backus is knocked out cold while mixing a drink in the cabin) and not knowing how to use the radio! The punch lines are a scream! Rooney (hysterical on the radio): ""Hey, you on the ground! We're up here in the air! Benjy, say something..."", Hackett: ""Help!"" Ceasar and his wife trying to charter a plane at an airport in the desert and end up with a broken-down 1920's biplane which has a maximum speed of about 50 mph. Ceasar with a hesitant look (to his wife): ""They don't make 'em like this anymore! Tried and true!"" (The woman starting the prop ends up blessing the plane before takeoff). Ethel Merman, Milton Berle in Terry Thomas' truck: Ethel Merman annoyed (to Terry Thomas): ""Where'd you get that funny accent? From Harvard?"" Thomas: ""I'm from England"". Merman: ""Sounds so foreign"". The auto garage scene is classic Jonathan Winters. Phil Silvers is great as a money-hungry con-artist who dupes Jonathan Winters but ends up getting duped himself as he tries to find a shortcut through the desert. He runs across an Indian who needs a lift to get some medication. Silvers eventually finds himself down some dirt road in the middle of nowhere and relies on a little boy who wants some money to get him back to the main road but he's led to a road which is buried by a river. Silvers portrays his frustration hilariously! Don Knotts puts in a small role as a nervous driver who picks up Phil Silvers on the side of the road. Sid Ceasar is in excellent form when he and his wife get locked in a hardware basement while they're looking for a pick and shovel. Then Ceasar destroys the hardware store with fireworks and a sledge hammer while trying to break out of the basement. Ethel Merman and Dick Shawn are great as a hysterical mother and son. Terry Thomas is hilarious. As for the sexist accusations: all of this was tongue in cheek, harmless and was standard in the 1960-1970's. (Making fun of the country's preoccupation with busoms can hardly be called discriminatory.) This movie is good clean fun no matter how you slice it. The great thing about this is that the secondary actors are big names (Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny, Jim Backus, The Three Stooges, Buster Keaton, Peter Faulk) and put in big jokes as well, they're not just standbys. The producers pulled out all the stops in this movie, the writing is fantastic. This is a non-stop journey and non-stop entertainment (but the ending was always a little slow for me). Nonetheless, if you are bored or had a bad day at work watch this and you will bust your gut. I defy anyone to find a movie like this today.

That's why I was eager to watch this one, a classic ""comedy"" film (I love good comedies).Said that, this movie barely made me laugh -- if anything, a bleak condescending Bezos' style smirk.There's only one scene of about ten seconds duration in this three-hour movie that pull off an smile from me: the hand-shaking at the control tower scene (very much in the line of The Naked Gun and Hotshots).Nonetheless, it was fun to re-live for a few hours what was like to be in America in the early sixties: the people, the streets, the shops, the cars, the cities landscape -- like, everything.Oh, and it was nice to see the tribute to the three wacky fellas too :)But overall this is a quite mediocre movie, all hysterical shouting and screaming that far from making you laugh out of the exaggerated acting (I believe that was the intention), it stuns you to no end making you thank to the heavens once the movie has finished for the much sought repairing silence.I'd recommend everyone interested in watching this dull film get the extended version (ideally the one from CRITERION) as it fills some gaps with a bunch of very nice photographs taken on the set behind the scenes.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

I remember seeing it as a 13-year old in 1963 and laughing so hard that the laughs turned to tears. The phrase ""Buried under the Big W"" always brings smiles. I'd always thought of it as a classic comedy, but after seeing it a year or two ago on the Encore cable network, I'm not sure that it has held up as well as I'd recalled it. Still, there are dozens of priceless moments from the time Smiler Grogan ""kicks the bucket"" to the destruction of the gas station until the final ""slip on the banana peel"" that make me nostalgic for the comedy of my youth.  I've always hoped for a sequel, but now realize that a sequel might only be destined for failure -- just like most of the '60s TV-sitcom movies that we've seen over the past 10-15 years.

When I was in the states in 95 I bought the US VHS double video version and I´ve got the DVD on pre-order and hopefully all the deleted scenes and interviews will be included as they add an extra insight to the making of the movie . I´m a big Phil Silvers fan so the humour is right up my street . There are too many stand out scenes in this film to pick just one , but if I had to it´d be the look on Jonathan Winters face as Phil Silvers drives off in the car without him . Maybe one more when Dick Shawn's in his car going to get his mum (Ether Merman) and he´s crying saying ""Don´t worry mama , your baby's coming to get you , that's why you had me mama , to save you "" or words to that effect .

I was 14 years old and went with a church group. The theater where it played did fund raisers for local churches and I remember my mom giving me money to go, which seems like about $1.00. The theater had a big curved; I think was called Cinerama but not sure now.Anyway, I was so taken with IAMMMMW and it had been playing a while and I saw that it was playing at a different theater; smaller and farther away but it didn't matter. I saw it there at least twice.I think the next time I saw it was after I was married in 1973 and VHS tapes hit the market. I had a copy of it on VHS and then moved on to DVD when that came about.I know that in a box someone in my garage, I have about 40 DVD's of movie I love. Whether I'll dig out IAMMMMW since it's available online in several places.Anyway, I've read about it and talked to others about it and it just dawned on me that for a long time Carl Reiner was the last living cast member. And now, as of 6/29/2020 there are none of the major stars around.I love IAMMMMW. I know there's some slow parts and things that don't make sense.

Dick Shawn who plays her son is crazy. Milton Berle, more subdued in this film, plays his role very well. Sid Caesar was at the very top of his game. Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett are outstanding as well.It is interesting, because with todays technology, a movie premise like this would never work. Just use a cell phone or navigation system, and the chase would not be necessary.I introduced this movie to my younger one, who is 10, and doesn't know any of these actors.

Yes, we know she's a loud battle-ax, can we move on please?Basically all they do is run around like crazy people for two plus hours (we watched the 160 minute version, not the 192 minute version, both were in the Blu-Ray box) and it simply gets tiresome.

Some of the all-time Hollywood greats are here: Spenser Tracy, Jack Benny, Phil Silvers, Sid Caesar, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett, Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters, Peter Falk, Buster Keaton, Jerry Lewis, Don Knotts, Carl Reiner, The Three Stooges (Joe Version), Jimmy Durante, Sterling Holloway, Jim Backus (Thurston Howell III), and more. Unbelievable!Unfortunately the movie is Horrible. Yes, capital 'H' Horrible. Worst of all, it is just *not* funny. At all.The comedy is obnoxious and immature (how can anyone possibly find the grating Ethel Merman entertaining?). If these three hours of Ethel nagging and screaming and bitching and yelling don't drive you to a migraine, then I don't know what will.Then there is the repetitive, unfunny physical comedy: car crashes, wobbly knees, crossed eyes, women swinging purses, Sylvester wants to fight, more car crashes, airplane stunts, men falling down, more with the crossed eyes, people flying through the air, people landing in trees, Sylvester wants to fight again, women slipping on banana peels, more projectile people (into water fountains, through windows), men making silly faces, even more car crashes and still more crossed eyes. The childish silliness reaches an 'enough already!' level very early in the movie - but then it just keeps going and going.You can wait all 188 minutes for the punch line. You can wait for the big payoff you just know must be coming. and. well. uh. sorry, but no. There is no such thing. In fact, if not for most of the cast ending up in the hospital in traction, there is no reason the movie simply just doesn't pick up steam again and keep going for another 3 hours.I will admit, however, that watching Mad World does make me smile. There are no moments of sidesplitting guffaws or even light-hearted chuckles. But there are smiles. These smiles are smiles of genuine appreciation for this incredible collection of past Hollywood greats. There has probably never been nor will there ever again be such a collection of big-time stars in a single film. Smart money says that the outtakes, if they exist, are far superior to the project that brought these people together in the first place.If only to offer others the chance to see this grand cast, I do recommend the film.

It included an all-star cast of some of the greatest actors and comedians of the time, several who go uncredited. Name another movie earlier that 1963 that can boast that.I can only imagine it inspired several future films including ""The Russians are Coming, the Russians are Coming"", ""Rat Race"", and possibly ""The Twelve Chairs"" (both the Soviet and Mel Brooks versions).Sure, some of the stereotypes and gags are dated; what wouldn't be after 50+ years?

The dialog and physical comedy are both funny. As a Sid Caesar fan, the hardware store farce and his temper tantrums against inanimate obstacles reminds me of myself and is hilarious. Dick Shawn, his unsmiling girlfriend, his sobbing pursuit of his ""Mama"" and other antics are funny as heck. The use of cameos and the cast of comedy icons really makes this movie one to see for younger people to get a good sampling of the comedic talent in that era. Merman was great in her portrayal of the harpy mother-in-law putting her famous vocal pipes to good use. Tracy, as the beleaguered father with the world weary face was a joy to watch. At the risk of sounding stuffy, the movie was and is still funny without the use of profanity and bathroom humor, which to me are the two crutches of comedians and comedy writers who lack true creativity and talent.

Like the 3 Stooges running up to the scene of a fire, they are on screen for only a few seconds. Or Jerry Lewis, running over Spencer Tracy's hat. It adds to the movie that so many comics worked together, large parts and small, to create this masterpiece. I had forgotten about the ""drive-in movie"" inspired ""intermission"" which was shown when the movie was first released.

I was 9 and I didn't know who Phil Silvers or Jonathan Winters or Ethyl Merman was. Since then, I have seen this movie about 20 times; various versions in many states of sobriety so I feel I can give a very biased opinion :).Let's look at the time it was made. They pretty much got all the comedians that were on TV from the previous 20 years. This rarely works in film without a good story. Not now, but back then, it was worth a shot.The storyline is actually about a dozen or so beings/stories happening at the same time that all come together in the end. Tarantino? No. Sienfeld..closer. Doesn't give the viewer a chance to lose attention. That's important.From a film-makers standpoint, it's perfect and it was in all aspects. Even the boo-boos worked. A producer/director's dream.

By that I mean to say that I immediately find myself in tears of laughter with every replay - which makes me out to be someone who would derive pleasure from just looking at shiny objects for hours on end; but that is not the case, at least not most of the time.I think today's ""comedies"" have taken on a meaner spirit. Although slapstick is as mean as you can get in the genre of comedy - I mean that this particular style of comedy seems kinder in a weird kind of way. I don't hate or even pity these poor souls who have given into their baser selves and are completely overwhelmed by avarice. And I don't particularly take joy in their suffering through what may be considered some of the most brilliant pratfalls ever to be filmed. I relish the idea that any of us could succumb to lunacy if the price were right. Maybe not to the level in the movie, but something this side of sane.

This may be one of the first films to use multiple cameras filming the same scene. There must've been 3 on Jimmy Durante's car flying off the cliff (with a zoom-out effect to boot).

267,willmeyers93,"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Classic!",10,22 September 2014,"""Mad World"" is a prime example of how a movie can stand the test of time. In this case, fifty-plus years have passed since this seminal comedy film was in theaters, but the writing, acting, and overarching absurdity still feels fresh.For starters, the plot doesn't require one's brain to stretch to unearthly limits (a rule which, for comedies, typically shouldn't be deviated from): A group of normal passersby en route to different destinations witness the car accident of a robber on the lam and, upon attempting to help him, become privy to the location of buried moolah. Quite a lot of it, in fact. A failed attempt at reasonably figuring out a way to equally split the dead guy's cash prompts the group to embark on the obvious: a frantic, no-holds-barred, outrageously funny odyssey towards the money and the ""Big W"" it supposedly rests beneath. It's mayhem of the highest caliber, and there are a number of things that bolster the unfolding of this story. To name a few: 1) The cast is pure gold. For each role (starring and cameos alike), I couldn't imagine a more talented actor/actress suited for it. Much of what the comedy juggernauts from that era were known for shows up in the characters they portray. Phil Silvers' fast-talking, finger- snapping, larger-than-life ego (a la Sgt. Bilko) surfaces in the form of materialistic motorist Otto Meyer, who creates some brilliant chemistry with jumpsuited furniture mover Lennie Pike, played by none other than improv master Jonathan Winters; there's gap toothed, khaki-clad jalopy driver Hawthorne, played by Terry-Thomas, who provides comedy just by showing his quintessentially British self. And when you throw in the shrieking, henpecking mother-in-law played by Ethel Merman, you've only just begun to experience the bizarre melting pot of citizens populating this silly, sun-drenched road trip through the meandering deserts of the Golden State. And, vast as the number may be, the cameo appearances never bog down the story but only serve to enrich it. My only complaint with the celebrity roster here is the absence of Dick van Dyke and Lucille Ball. Fortunately, the movie doesn't suffer to any degree without them, although a vignette with either one would've likely been sidesplitting. 2) Some reviews here have attacked the movie's runtime, claiming it causes pieces of the film to generate boredom. I beg to differ. If anything, I wish it were longer! As it stands, there's enough time devoted to the various characters' escapades and the the pacing of their individual sequences is perfect. Even the moments in the Santa Rosita police station, where slapstick wasn't prevalent, didn't drag. The time was well utilized here to develop characters by means of witty dialogue, especially between William Demarest's Chief Aloysius and Spencer Tracy's Cpt. Culpepper. 3) I'd be remiss to forget the climax, which has to be one of the greatest in film. I won't say much because words can't really do it justice, but it's the type of scene that you have to view yourself. Maybe even more than once! I've laughed hard at this scene, to the point of tears, and there's always something new to pick up each time. I highly, highly recommend this farcical masterpiece for anyone who needs cheering up and I'd definitely show it to someone who's only ever seen contemporary comedies. Maybe their viewpoint on the comedy genre will change? ""Mad World"" definitely proves that you can fill a 3- hour slot with visual and verbal gags that don't need raunchiness or profanity to back them up or provide the basis of humor. As it's been said many times: they don't make 'em like they used to!",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

This movie is VERY LONG. I feel as though it could have been cut shorter. I couldn't say when, but I really feel that they could have sacrificed comedic slapstick for how much this movie drags itself along the ground. It may be that I'm not interested enough in the subject matter to be fully embraced by its fun and games. The actors are fine. They didn't exactly stand out to me enough for me to say, ""Oh wow, I want to see them in a different movie!"" Their characters are complete stereotypes at the end of the day. In some comedic moments, I found myself wondering if they were hurt or if they were okay instead of laughing at their destruction. And yes, they do destroy a lot of things in this film for laughs. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys the cat and mouse sort of humor and has a lot of time to kill.

She belonged to the PTA at the time and they somehow got notice of extras being needed for the film, so she went down and spent three days filming in the street. This is the first time I've watched the movie all the way thru... 40 years later. HA HA!! What an odd film, strangely funny, very nostalgic. I do like it better than a lot of the dark comedy we've been fed by Hollyweird for several years. If it weren't for the nostalgia, I might not have rated this film as high because it does tend to drag from being a bit ""too funny"" for too long.

It's easy to lose focus on the plot Mad World actually has when you are bombarded with the film's hilarious and insane antics. Not to mention one of the biggest casts of some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry. This film is an absolute treasure trove of so many big name stars, and it's really difficult to determine who really carries the film. In my mind, not a SINGLE actor does, ALL the actors do. And along with what some may say is 2 1/2 hours of nonsensical nonsense (only a matter of opinion that I do not share), the film has a sense of adventure about it. I grew up with this movie. I have no idea how many times I have watched it. I can say I am no less tired of it each time I do. And I suspect I would probably love it as much if I saw it for the first time yesterday. Somehow, I think there will always be an audience for this film. Even generations not as familiar with the actors in this as I am. But I think this film should hold a special place in the hearts of those of us who grew up watching these people in various other films because they are all together here. In any case, this film was not meant to be taken seriously, not meant to take itself seriously, but only meant to take some of the seriousness out of the individual watching it for a while.

The Cinerama experience was remarkable in itself. But the film was wonderfully funny. An unbelievable cast, one of the best directors of our time, and one of the funniest scripts ever written. Some of the duologue is priceless. Selma Diamond's voice on the phone - the wife of Captain Culpepper (Spencer Tracy) was worth the price of admission.The original film was 3 1/2 hours long, including the intermission. It was complete with an overture, and entre'act, and exit music. During intermission there was more music and duologue playing in the lobby as if the action was continuing. When the movie went to wide distribution it was cut drastically to about 2 1/2 hours. Over the years the studio lost a lot of that footage. So when the wanted to restore it to its original release, they couldn't. The did find 22 minutes of the deleted scenes in an old warehouse that was slated for demolition. It was the original 70mm stock and was in pretty good shape.It first came back restored (as best it could be) to laser disc. I bought a laser disc player just for that. It was wide screen (a new concept at the time in home video) and looked tremendous. When the DVD was release, the quality was superb but they did not include those extra 22 minutes. I have never heard why.Once every couple of years the old Cinerama Dome (which has been completely remodeled and is now just a very large and a 35mm projector with an anamorphic lens) will run Mad World for a week. I usually go down and see it. I can't count the number of times I have watched it.All these years later, the duologue is still funny and not at all dated. Some of the comic routines these brilliant comedians did that long ago are not funny anymore just with the passage of time. But that is not true with this movie. I still laugh out loud at lines I have heard 100 times.It is just incredible to see all those people together. Many people don't like this film and criticize it any chance they get.

Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise were perfect for each other, but other than them and Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr, the other groups in the race really had nothing going for them.  They were all 2-bit actors with no chemistry. Although very enjoyable, this film didn't even come close. Don't even get me started with ""Rat Race"".  Are you kidding me!? Whoopi Goldberg and Seth Green is the best this generation can do?!  What a joke! Just goes to show, not only are the quality of comedic actors diminishing over the years, but there is no way that the best of the best would even consider getting together to make a good film.  Not unless they were getting paid considerably.  As it turns out, there were more actors interested in ""Mad World"" then the writers had room for.  They all took notice that this film was going to be something special.  Jerry Lewis really wanted to have a bigger role, but he was too late and he, and many other actors had to settle for cameos or bit parts. (The film is over two and a half hours long as it is!)

There's a wide range of comedians in a hilarious feature film originally in Cinerama. From the opening scene, shortly after Jimmy Durante kicks a bucket, until the last moment when Ethel Merman slips on a banana peel, the characters, action (some of which was cut in the shorter versions), plot, and background (especially in Cinerama) all come together in an entertaining motion picture which is sure to hold your attention if you're interested in watching a movie without any interruptions. What and where is the Big W? And why are there so many characters running around with a shovel? The plot eventually has these wacky individuals ending up at the same location only to wind up with some slapstick comedy. The situations that occur with the characters illustrates the title of the movie which is why it's my favorite.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
297,DAVIDDORSET,It was a pleasure..,8,11 May 2003,"Well the film was on TV in England over the May Day Holiday - lets face it, it's a great schedule filler. This time I managed to video it and watched it twice through (OK I did fast forward the rather drawn out ending the second time). Phil Silvers is his rogueish self but doesn't have it all his own way, Sid Caesar at first trying to be restrained and reasonable, then joining in the race just like the others, J Winters riding that little kids bike with murder in his heart, Terry-Thomas and his cacti, and as for Ray and Irwins' garage...So many classy scenes and a triumph that so many talented people all got a chance to shine. Oh yes, and the tiny cameo from Jack Benny was a gem. It's 20 minutes too long, but after 40 years still one of the best films I've seen.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

One of the best writers and directors, plus a cast never matched before or since (and never will be with today's salaries.) Basically, if you were to eliminate the stars of this classic from show business history, it would never have had the same impact which it did. No Sid Caesar, Phil Silvers or Uncle Milte (Berle) in television. How about stand-up comedy, no Dick Shawn, Johnny Winters, Buddy Hackett or Jack Benny. No Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney would certainly have changed the history of film entirely. And music and Broadway without Ethel Merman. Haven't even touched on the ""little"" side characters like, Jerry Lewis, Three Stooges, Don Knotts, Terry Thomas, Eddie Rochester Anderson, Peter Falk, Carl Reiner, Ben Blue, Buster Keaton, Paul Ford, and that's just about half of the cast !!!!!!!!

What ensues is the classic ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"". Great cast, great story, all the imitators that have followed pale in comparison to the chase-comedy champ (""Rat Race"", ""Scavenger Hunt"", etc). Highlights include a couple of airplane rides, a new gas station & the wackiest use of a fire truck ever seen. A fabulous cast that includes Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, Jonathan Winters, Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett, et al. race through this movie, tearing up anything in sight. This movie has such a storied history that half the fun is trying to figure out who the actors are that romped through this spectacle.I could point out numerous reasons why this is a classic but the most important reason is this: they don't make movies like this anymore.

301,jhutter,A Wonderful Comedy That Is Unfairly Slammed by Critics,9,29 November 2003,"""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" rates as my favorite movie of all time.  It boasts an incredibly funny and well-written story, and features many of the greatest comics who were living at the time of filming (1963).  It is a tale of greed, and how that deadly sin will drive otherwise decent individuals to almost any degree of wrongdoing.  I have watched ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" at least a dozen times in the past thirty years.  Every time I have seen it, the film remains laugh-out-loud funny, and I constantly discover new laughs.Sadly, many critics do not view ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" so favorably. In most movie ratings books, it averages two-and-a-half stars, and is usually slammed for it's fast-paced and neurotic brand of humor and excessive length.I have also learned that ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" had the unfortunate timing of being released the week of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Critics, mortified by the senseless death of a popular president, were not in the mood for madcap comedy.  It seems that these scribes vented their emotions on this film, and unfairly panned its virtues as faults.The only criticism that I will agree with is length.  At three hours, ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" can be a test of any movie goer's endurance. While all of the bizarre plot twists justify a lengthy movie, I am convinced that this film could have been shortened by 30 to 60 minutes, and would have lost none of the story nor the laughs.  The problem seems to be with the editing. There is entirely too much repetition in the car chase scenes, and many lines of dialog are redundant.  To me, it appears that many scenes were padded and dragged out for the sake of unnecessarily building suspense.  I would love to see an edited version of this movie re-released, removing most of this repetition and redundancy.  I wonder if the critical reception would be any more favorable.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
302,rip-31,great picture,10,23 August 2005,"My brother and I were living in Long Beach, when the filming was there. The apt that we lived in can be seen across the street from the hardware store, The Jone's cafeteria where we worked after school is three doors down (I was a senior in Dewy high school ) My brother and I were standing in a small group of people in the alley as the chase scene of taxi's after Spencer Tracy's car whirled around a small parking area. One of the taxi's hit the back left fender and popped a tail light off, it rolled to us so we picked it up and kept it. My brother has since lost it. I watch the VCR copy about three times a year, and watch for that tail light to pop of in the pitcher. It brings back a lot of good memories of my younger days as i am in my 66th year. I love watching the movie because of all the great actors in it. It is one of a kind, because getting that kind of talent together will never happen again. A good portion of those in the picture have passed away i'm very sorry to say. There kind of talent is lost.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
303,phunzicker-433-53096,Opening scene,9,26 July 2012,"Yes, this movie gets better every time you see it. For me, the best scene is the opening scene when they go down to help the old man and the cops arrive. Durante's rantings about ""back to the neighborhood"" and the look on everybody's face is classic. The music is right on. Then when the cop shows up and he is questioning them, ever notice he gets an answer from someone behind him? The choreography is brilliant. ""did he say anything?"" ""about what?"" There are so many great lines. What makes this movie work is great writing that makes all the characters so believable even though the movie itself is so unbelievable. What is amazing is how good the actor's were but few of them went on to make any other movies of any value, Sid Caesar, Milton Berle, Jonathon Winters ( okay- ""The Russians are coming"")Mickey Rooney.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

Just don't say anything if you have nothing nice to say. I recently watched this movie with 3 12 year old kids and we laughed our heads off, so I don't think it held up it did, and I don't think i was still relevant because it was. This opinion was and is based on facts not what I think. rent this movie and you will see it is remarkable. It is also remarkable how much of the dialoq was improvised. Dick Shawn's dancing scene was crazy even watching it today. Estelle Wiliiams perfect. Johnathan Winters brilliant. and I haven't even mentioned Spencer Tracy, Milton Berle, or Jimmy Durante or Buddy Hacket and Mickey Rooney. I really loved this movie.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
305,kevin-estes,What a ride!,8,15 April 2006,"I first saw this movie at my grandparent's house in the mid 70s. I was about 8 years old, and everything about this movie made me laugh. Granted, I was too young to know any of the stars beyond the cameo appearance of the Three Stooges, but still...slapstick comedy done by the best Hollywood had to offer. Even my grandparents, Puritanical they may have been, laughed out loud at it. Even today, if it comes on TCM or another movie channel, I stop what I'm doing and clear my calendar for the rest of the day. If Hollywood could have kept making movies of this caliber instead of the dreck they sweat-shop produce today to turn a quick buck, we'd be better off. I mean, come on...when's the last time you saw major Hollywood players in a movie together that didn't suck? Jonathan Winters is a comic genius, and the way he stole the screen during his apocalyptic fight with Ray and Irwin...priceless. Totally priceless. Much better than anyone ""gracing"" the silver screen today. And Ethel Merman...come on! She was perfect as the harpy mother in law to Milton Berle. Buddy Hackett and Mickey Rooney as the two hapless boobs in the airplane with Jim Backus...all three irreplaceable gems of comedy. Don't even tell me that Rat Race even compares to IAMMMMW.

The last time I saw it I was 50 something, and it still made me laugh. It is a ridiculous movie with a single sentence where the plot should be. It is not fancy. It is dirty (no, not in That way), and I too have no business liking this movie but I do. And I'll watch it again, especially if it is a dismal day and all I have the energy to ask of a movie is that it make me laugh. Perhaps it is as simple as the fact the movie reminds me of my childhood. Whatever the reason, pop some corn. Pour a beer.

Since then I got to see it many more times. I have it on video and last week bought a DVD version. What can I say? To me there is no better comedy. I think enough said before me - I will only join those who praise it. Some people call it a slapstick. I call it a masterpiece. The gallery of actors is a wonderful treat by itself. Probably I was spoiled by such a great comedy. Since you see it, very few films measure up. I regret very much, that Ethel Merman did not appear in more films, she is a terrific comedienne. By the way, only much later I learned that she also things(Ha-Ha). Anyway 10 out of 10 hands down.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
309,eeskridge,Great 1963 movie,9,23 January 2005,"I saw this film on TV the other night and it was great to see all the stars from my childhood in this movie. It was like going back in a time-machine to 1963. I especially loved seeing Jack Benny! It was also interesting to see how they treated women in those days (sexist was OK) and the blacks in the jalopy is prior to civil rights time! I was disappointed in the ending however. With Spencer Tracy just running away with the money--it looked like a lost cause. The ended needed to be more developed. I think I would have liked it better if one of the parties had succeeded in getting to the ""Big W"" first and uncovered money and the others chasing them. Or if the Police Chief had had a more carefully planned out plan--I was disappointed that the Police Chief did not have a plan!! He was just stumbling around with the money in the end and they all lost the money too. A downer after all the trouble they went through! But I loved it otherwise.

310,ehust,"Its a mad, mad, mad, mad, world",10,28 December 2004,"One of the great allstar casts for movies of its kind. A original movie where just being in a cameo role had a tremendous amount of big time actors. From Jerry Lewis to Jack Benny, to Buster Keaton, this was a movie that had a who's who list of A list actors. The plot was one of the first to really play on words, where kicking the bucket really meant just that! Literally as Jimmy Durante so well does when he has his auto accident. Spencer Tracey is wonderful as the aging police detective, with a wonderful supporting cast of actors in his office. A very young Julie London (wow)! The main characters well what can one say, Johnathan Winters is just himself, zany as always, love his scene where he tears up the garage! Best part of the movie! Buddy Hackett and Mickey Rooney in the airplane with Jim Backus, again wonderful, Milton Berle, Dorothy Provine, and Ethel Merman, what can I say, talk about opposites. Then add in Sid Caesar and Edie Adams. And that section of them in the basement of the hardware store, what can go wrong will go wrong. A little old for this time and day in 2004 but still at times very funny. Add the ending to this movie and it rates as one of the great comedies of all time, on a par with Spaceballs, or Young Frankenstein! Mel Brooks I am sure took from its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World when he conceived his wonderful movies. All three rank up their as really outstanding movies of their time! It would really be neat though to see Hollywood recreate its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World, change the story line to update it to todays world, but oh the actors I think that we could have reprising all of the original rolls. A who's who 2005 style of todays stars. Imagine Catherine Zeta Jones doing the roll of Edie Adams.

313,cairoraftice,Awesome Comedy Romp,10,21 January 2015,"I loved this movie when I saw it as a child and recently watched it again as a 50 years old and found it to still be incredibly funny. Most movies that are 50 years old really show their age. If it were not for the classic cars and ""classic"" actors, this movie could have been made in 2014. It is an hilarious movie that features some of the best physical comedy ever. The cast is a literal ""Who's Who"" of comedic actors of the time. I have seen reviews that criticize the movie for a ""lack of character development"" and ""awful pacing"" and think that these people are completely missing the point. This movie is not meant to be deep or thought provoking but is rather a breakneck comedy romp that is pure fun. However, it does deliver a great message about the power of greed that is as relevant today, perhaps more so, as it was in 1963 But the message is obvious and not heavy. The movie is just meant to be fun and if you accept it in these terms it delivers in spades. As I watched the movie, I could just imagine my late mother howling with laughter at some of the crazy antics and physical zaniness. As for pacing, there is one speed; breakneck. The movie is 2:40 and actually features an intermission but I never found myself bored for a second as the movie never slows down and the action is constant. If you are looking for a crazy comedy that will make you laugh, this movie is a classic that delivers and features some of the greats of the time such as Jonathon Winters, Phil Silvers,Mickey Rooney, Milton Berle, Buddy Hackett and a very memorable performance by Ethel Merman as the mother-in-law from hell.

Yes, it's somewhat dated but the dialogue and the pacing and the expressions just captivated me.If you are of the younger generation you really need to see this as an instruction manual for how to do good CLEAN comedy. These were some of the biggest, greatest stars of all-time - all together.The ending seemed a little corny, but not too much. It's supposed to be a movie where you sit back and have fun and let yourself laugh. You may have to look up some of the old-time references so you will understand (like why the 3 Stooges and Buster Keaton do what they do) - but to me that adds to the fun of the movie, knowing a little about that time period.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World
315,jailnurse,"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.",6,9 July 2005,"Anyone who watches this movie for its continuity, cohesion, and steady comedic stream will be disappointed. But anyone with a love of the comic stars of the 50's and 60's, who watches this movie as an homage to the comedy greats who came before them, and who understands that, like the lineup in a comedy club, sooner or later the guy (or girl) you came to see is going to get a chance to strut his or her stuff, the movie will delight you.Unfortunately, even at 3 hours, there isn't enough time to get them all in. Some of the early giants (The Three Stooges, Jack Benny, Jimmy Durante, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, Stepin Fetchit, and even the immortal ""Stone Face"", Buster Keaton) are mere ""blink and they are gone"" extras, rather than performers with meat. They each get to do a tiny riff; a signature line, behavior, or expression, and they'r Eugene, your attention given back to the madness enfolding in front of you. (And if you should wonder about possible homage to the Marx brothers--the whole movie, with its chaos and sly take on social mores, pays that price in full.)However, if the viewer takes each scene as a stand-alone vignette in which at least two great comedians will square off and assault your funnybone, you have discovered the delight of this movie. Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney and Jim Backus in an out-of-control airplane? An airplane that is going to try to land at an airport after being talked down by Carl Reiner and Paul Ford? No wonder it's the Three Stooges standing by for the crash...Terry-Thomas, Milton Berle and the magnificently, demonically obnoxious Ethel Merman cooped up in a car wobbling down a highway? (Dorothy Provine is also in the scene, but she is smart enough to curl up in a corner and let the sparks fly.) On his way to rescue his Momma (Merman) is psycho-beach-bum-Momma's boy Dick Shawn. Sid Ceasar left alone with the devastatingly gorgeous (and beautifully understated) Edie Adams would do what? Blow up and burn down the store, of course.Keeping a steady hand on all of these threads of insanity is the inimitable Spencer Tracy. All is well. Tracy as an actor was known for his integrity, his dignity, and his absolute lack of insanity. He plays the straight man to the collective bedlam descending upon his city right up until the very end...or nearly the end. So, rent or buy the movie. You won't laugh all the way through, but then, you couldn't; there are just too many funny people in it. Instead, watch each scene for the classic character that has come to be the signature of the actor who created it. Also look for the priceless mixes and matches of different comedic talents.

I still do get laughs from it, just to see all the famous faces in it is worth the time to sit and take it all in. I grew up in the long beach, calif; area and to see much of the old city on the screen brings back memories. if you know where to look, you can see the old, cyclone racer, roller coaster in the distance during the rescue scene at the end. there is a shot of ""death"" as the cars whiz around the streets of long beach. he was located on ocean blvd and kept track of how many traffic accidents and traffic fatalities occurred during that year.",It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World

Some peeves though:1. The DVD is 2-sided. I hate these cheapskates. You have to be very careful handling these.2. The Ultra Panavision is still missing the very right and left edges of the screen on the DVD. I saw this movie in the original Cinerama Dome in Hollywood during a special anniversary showing a few years ago. The scene in the Beech 18 aircraft with Mickey Rooney, Buddy Hackett and Jim Backus is actually much funnier in the theater. This is because you can see the airport BEHIND them beyond the edges of the plane. They are still in the takeoff climb and Backus is already asking them to make him a drink!
