0,bkoganbing,Barrio Epic,9,16 June 2009,"Based on the real life experiences of poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, Bound By Honor covers two decades in the latter half of the 20th century as seen through the eyes of half brothers Benjamin Bratt and Jesse Borrego and their cousin Damian Chapa. Growing up more or less together, all three start out as gang bangers, but each has a different destiny and in many ways one's destiny is caused by the actions of the others.Borrego gets injured in a gang retaliation and works hard to not become a cripple. He does however become both a painter of note and a drug addict of considerable appetite. A tragedy there sets him and Bratt apart.Bratt also winds up in a feud with Chapa. When both were young gang bangers and looking to retaliate for Borrego, Bratt and Chapa are arrested. Because this was Bratt's first offense he got a choice of the military or jail time and he chose the Marines. Chapa however was sent to prison, to San Quentin to be precise where he joined the Chicano prison gang La Onda. Pretty soon Chapa is high in the gang councils and deep in the politics of the prison. Bratt in the meantime joins the LAPD and destiny makes these two collide.Bound By Honor has an epic quality almost a kind of Chicano Gone With The Wind. The mostly Hispanic cast do a great job in depicting life in the Barrio. The film runs just about three hours and it's a tribute to director Taylor Hackford that your interest doesn't flag for a minute.Hackford also creates many interesting supporting characters two numerous to mention, always the mark of a good film. But your interest is always in the three leads. You get to care about what is to become of them, what destiny has in store.There are certain similarities between Bound By Honor and the Edward James Olmos film, American Me. Personally I give a slight edge to this one, don't miss it if it is broadcast.","Blood In, Blood Out"
1,kosmasp,Best movie ever (imho),10,20 April 2006,"I don't like catchy summary lines, but I used one here. I just love this movie. There are many movies that I like and love, but if someone asked me about my favorite movie of all time, than I always say it is ""Blood in Blood out"".And that kind of sounds awkward, if the other person doesn't know the movie. It sounds like a horror movie or something. But then again I can't think of another/better title to this film (apart from ""Bound by honor"" under which it is also known). It's a movie about life.What makes it so great for me? Although I heard from some people that they don't like the acting, and maybe in some parts that's true (after all there's no one like Al Pacino or *add a favorite actor name here*). But it's more than appropriate for this movie and it's not distracting at all. In fact I was hooked by the movie from beginning to end.The story that is told here needs the film to be long and not one minute of it seems boring. The characters grab you from the very start and you feel with them the whole movie. Everything that happens to them, you are there to witness it and feel with/for them. That makes a good drama.I love every aspect of the movie. The only thing that I could complain about is, then whenever this movie is on somewhere (on TV) and I see it, I can't switch the TV off or change the channel. I have to watch that movie and take the emotional ride once again. :o)","Blood In, Blood Out"
2,whpratt1,An Amazing Film,10,20 September 2005,"Recently viewed this film which was called, ""Blood In Blood Out"" and could hardly believe the great details and realistic way this film was produced. There is no doubt that it showed what Prison Life really is like among all races, Black, Brown, White and many more and how each group has to struggle to exist and at the same time have fun, make money and kill each other. If you wanted sex in prison, you had plenty of willing partners and it just might be a very difficult and hard way to deal with it, or just simply getting raped when you least expect it. A young guy gets out of jail and tries to go down the straight and narrow path and winds up losing a body part and is constantly trying to become a gang member. There is a guy who has a great ability of being an artist, drawing great paintings and he gets cut up and his back twisted like a pretzel. If you want to go to prison, watch this film and it just might change your mind completely. Plenty of action and it goes none stop through out the entire picture.","Blood In, Blood Out"
3,siderite,Surprisingly deep,8,13 September 2013,"At first glance one feels this is a TV movie, starting with a sunny day somewhere in east LA and a guy coming in and greeting anyone in Spanish, with colorful Mexicans all over. You may think, based on the movie title as well, that it will be one of those gang action movies where the hero beats up everybody. It certainly starts that way, but the movie is not like that.After a while, when the plot expands a little more, you find that the white dude that comes to greet his ""Chicano"" friends is a halfbreed American Mexican who hates his white father and considers himself ""brown on the inside"". He is also on parole and only days until he gets to be 18 and be totally free. Then he makes a stupid move. Now you think it is going to be one of those prison movies, with the misguided youth and the corrupt system. Perhaps he is going to go to prison and beat up everybody. That ain't it, either.It takes maybe a little to see that the movie isn't even close to being over so you look to the length of the film. It's 3 hours long! The fact that it starts showing the year in which things happen gives the final clue: it is an epic story. The complexity of the characters hint at a book or something like that and, indeed, the story is written by poet Jimmy Santiago Baca, based on his personal experience. It's almost a biopic.And look at the cast! Damian Chapa is pretty known, but also Benjamin Bratt, Delroy Lindo, Victor Rivers (can't have a movie about Mexicans without Rivers - I really think he should have gotten more main roles), Billy Bob Thornton, Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and even Jimmy Santiago Baca himself as ""Gato"", who I don't really remember.About the movie itself, its main strength is the characters. Each of the lead characters is being carefully sketched and then transformed by the story. The ending, most of all, explains the feelings and reality of the people involved. There were criticisms that the movie was overacted sometimes. Perhaps, but most of it was actually in character. Miklo is someone who is desperately, so desperately, trying to belong. Of course he overacts. His whole character is made up in his head.So, as a conclusion to this too long review: this is not a masterpiece, but it is a movie about the truth of people in those times, and it is well done. Truthful films are more and more scarce as the time goes by. If you find the time and mood to watch this white Mexican biopic, I don't think you will be disappointed.","Blood In, Blood Out"
4,=G=,A tinseltown take on Chicano gang/prison life,6,6 January 2003,"""Bound by Honor"" circles interminably around a trio of East L.A.  Chicano gang members through decades of life. Overwrought,  over acted, uninspired, and fraught with foibles and plotholes,  the film spends too much time wallowing in the numbing excesses of prison gang life and politics unable to escape the varnish and tarnish of a Hollywood contrived shock-value execution. Even if we needed another prison gang flick, which we don't, this flick accomplishes too little and runs too long wearing its characters down to nubs instead of fleshing them out with insights into familia, community, heritage, and church. Worst of all, we're not given anyone to care about leaving us with three hours of mechanical detachment. (C+)
Note - The version I Tivo'd included a lot of ""Spanglish"" with no subtitled translations and no closed captions.","Blood In, Blood Out"
5,sol-,Bound by Blood,7,14 March 2017,"'Blood In Blood Out', or 'Bound by Honor' as it is sometimes known, this is a solid film whatever the title, tracking the experiences of two Latino brothers and their cousin, each of whom go in diverse directions after a run-in with the police estranges them from each other. The film is very slow to warm up, only really taking off once the trio are arrested, but from then on there is a nary a dull moment to be had as the arrest influences one brother to become a policeman, the other to become an artist and the cousin to embrace jailbird life. Despite making very different life choices, fate eventually brings the paths of the trio together with each having to contend with having the same blood despite being on opposite sides of law and conventional living. If there is one thing to hold against the film, it is that it spends more than twice as much time on the cousin in jail as it does on the two brothers, but then again, his experiences in prison deliver all the highlights of the film. From attempted rapes to hidden messages to prison riots, the film depicts the jail experience of the 1970s in incredible depth with warring racial factions and unwritten codes of conduct that all abide by. The film is also blessed by one of Bill Conti's tersest music scores to date, a terrific supporting turn from Delroy Lindo and some remarkable artwork, including a full scale wall mural. Clocking in at close to three hours, this is not the lightest or breeziest film to get through, however, the ample length allows one to get under the characters' skins in a way that a shorter film could not have done half as well.","Blood In, Blood Out"
6,Ed-Shullivan,Planet of the Races Black Brown White,8,30 November 2016,"Spanish versus blacks versus white supremacists in a 1970-1980's melting prison pot just ready to boil over. Three young men living in a working class east L.A. neighborhood defined by the many gang- banger's who want to build their reputation for being the biggest bad asses are ready to rumble and look for any excuse to get it on next to their ""homies"".The three main characters are aspiring artist, lover and drug addicted Cruz (Jesse Borrego), ex-boxer turned law enforcement officer Paco (Benjamin Bratt) and angry mixed breed Spanish/White Miklo (Damian Chapa) who grow up together in a gang but as life takes its course over two decades these three men fight their own demons alone and sometimes pitted against one another.If you want to fight the bull sometimes you get the horn and Miklo who is struggling to gain acceptance of his mothers Spanish heritage because his skin color is white is constantly fighting the race card on all three sides of the Spanish, white and black prison gangs. Miklo is the one of the three young men who ends up in prison and must gain the trust of his Spanish prison gang members if he is going to survive his years in imprisonment. Although Damian Chapa's acting as his character Miklo was exceedingly over emphasized as an angry ""Chico"" we just never see a two dimensional character. On the brighter side the two other main characters Cruz (artist) and Paco (cop) evolve into men with a conscience and so they periodically reflect back on their younger gang war years as a brotherhood that must be respected but also realizing it was in their past and not in their future.There are some other great supporting cast members such as Raymond Cruz as Chuey the druggie, Victor Rivers as Spanish prisoner Magic Mike, Danny Trejo as Spanish prisoner Geronimo, Carlos Carrasco as Spanish prisoner Popeye, Ving Rhames as a prison gang intelligence detective named Ivan, Delroy Lindo as Bonafide the leader of the black prison gang, Tom Towles as white supremacist Red Ryder, and Billy Bob Thornton as white supremacist Lightning. As you can see by this depth of the talent pool most of whom went on to greater Hollywood fame, the director Taylor Hackford utilized his young talent pool to his full advantage and to the viewers greatest benefit.This film is a tad over 3 hours long, but surprisingly, there are no dead spots throughout the film. The intertwined stories of the 3 Spanish homies Cruz, Paco and Miklo are blended so well that we the viewer can only anticipate what is going to happen next, and to our surprise everything is not as it seems in their Spanish neighborhood, nor in the prison where Miklo grows into a hardened lifetime criminal battling the blacks and Aryan racists proving himself over and over to favor his Spanish heritage gang members.It took me 23 years to finally watch this film but I believe that Blood In, Blood Out has withstood the test of time and the storyline is still relative today as it was three decades ago when it was released in the early 1990's. So many great male stars went on to have great movie careers and this film could only have helped build their film resumes with such strong personal acting performances in a tough gang related film such as Blood In, Blood Out. I give the film an 8 out of 10 rating","Blood In, Blood Out"
7,Captain_Couth,A three hour cult classic. A great film for all the wrong reasons.,7,22 June 2004,"Blood In, Blood Out, Bound by Honor (1993) is nothing more than a biggest budgeted cheese fest This movie is a cult classic because of the bad acting, goofy writing and several big stars in small roles hamming up every scene they're in. What made ""American Me"" brilliant is missing in this ""epic"". The direction is pedestrian, the camera work isn't that great and the editing leads a lot to be desired. The actors act in two modes in this one, over or under acting. Sappy and cheesy at the same time isn't very good. When it tries to be melodramatic it seems phony and forced. When the film tries to become serious it's laughable. People want to complain about the lead actor Damian Chapa, he's actually quite good in his role compared to the rest of the cast. At least he shows true emotions. Benjamin Bratt looks like he's either going to laugh over his bad lines or forces himself to look ""determined"" in others. Tom Towles is his usual over the top self. I wish he had a cigar to chomp on and a big mustache he could twirl.Most of the blame can be put on the director. Some of it could be put on the script and the rest on the supporting cast. The film was delayed because they didn't want any violence in the theaters. Maybe it was released too soon after ""American Me"" was finished making it's rounds at the box office. This movie never became a real hit and faded away into obscurity. After editing and re-editing, the finish result is a three hour violent soap opera. Like I said before, it's highly entertaining for all the wrong reasons. Fun stuff, makes a great party tape.Recommended.P.S. The best version out is the 190 minute version. Not only does it expand several scenes but extra violence is added making the movie actually better. But since I'm reviewing the theatrical version. You take what you can get.DVD version: B+VHS/Cable cut: C","Blood In, Blood Out"
8,Luigi Di Pilla,It´s not my world,4,3 August 2002,"I expected more when I bought this movie on DVD but my imaginations were not at all fulfilled. I thought this could be again a good Taylor Hackford thriller but it didn´t work. Okay the story got more and more dramatic and exciting but there is no substance, it´s too long and we hear always the same cool dialogue about their gang. Perhaps this film could be an example for schools with high violence rate. Director Hackford is far away from his masterpieces like ""DOLORES CLAIBORNE"", ""THE DEVIL´S ADVOCATE"" or ""PROOF OF LIFE"". No, there is really nothing to miss and I think it is too overrated. But I have to admit that the performance from all the guys were strong. If you want to see a better film in this genre don´t miss ""187"" with Samuel L. Jackson. For all these reasons I gave 4/10.","Blood In, Blood Out"
9,DJAkin,Super over the top ESE movie,8,17 March 2007,"This was actually a very good movie. Sure, it was three hours long and every other word by every character was either VATO, ESE, ODALE or CABROBE. Actually, they never said Cabrone. But they said Odale a LOT and ese every other word. This was American Me on steroids!!! The main character was a white guy who was completely immersed in the CHICANO (not hispanic) culture. Yes, the word CHICANO was used a LOT! This was a really good flick though. Ben Bratt delivered the goods as a cholo named Paco. There were other good characters, like Popeye, Spider and Chucho. I am from the barrio of Albuquerque and I remember dudes like this. If you want to see the ESE movie of the century, I suggest THIS movie.","Blood In, Blood Out"
10,Richie-67-485852,A story telling movie and a roller coaster ride too,8,19 January 2012,"I always check for realism in movie scenes if the movie is going to go into detail about a certain subject. We all do it to some degree. Police, doctors, scientists all watch movies and know when what is or is not real when their scene with their expertise hits the screen. I did jail counseling and had exposure to the gangs, drugs, prison and street scenes that are shown in this movie are remarkably real and true to life and behind bars. Very nicely done for realism sake and schockingly accurate. Mom and dad in this movie are the streets and you and your family live by clique rules. Large cliques determine right and wrong and something even more powerful than that disciplines everyone which is the prison systems. Both ways fail and this movie chronicles that failure while staying true to the what they have to work with...real life. It is a long story told so that you can hitch a ride with it and then be roped in. Once in, fasten your seat belt and pray for a bathroom break...Its the only thing that will break the tension at times. Take heart, the players deliver you to an ending that helps you to recover your breath and resume a normal life. But you will tell others about this move and you will think about it from time to time...Popcorn, hard candy snacks and a good arm rest recommended...enjoy","Blood In, Blood Out"
11,bopdog,"Overblown hokum. A cliché-fest of silly and dangerous sociological pretension, conceit, and ""b.s.""",2,23 November 2002,"This movie doesn't wear well. While the themes and perhaps the intentions of ""Bound by Honor"" might have merit in other hands, ""Bound by Honor"" as a movie itself is so clichéd and sophomoric it becomes laughable when it's not being annoying. Its situations are formulaic, its white villains cartoonishly drawn, its ""nobility"" of the barrio/ghetto contrived and over-simplified. It actually paints a picture of the Hispanic ghetto life it that is far more derogatory of such ethnicities than typical Hollywood fare. The protagonists come off as weak-willed, mewling complainers prone only to every media-themed addiction, self-destructive behavior, and victim-label that modern sociology can bestow. It is, in fact, pure sociological pretension and conceit.""Bound by Honor"" is hokum and silly stereotyping passing for ""socially aware"" and ""brave"" drama. It is an ill-conceived and dangerous disservice to the very people it ostensibly aims to empower. A very crass but accurate descriptor of this mess of a movie is ""bulls***""","Blood In, Blood Out"
12,bsinc,Too long and a bad lead actor,6,10 March 2005,"Amigos, if you don't want to sit for three hours & more, well, then I don't recommend this movie. It's overly OVERLY long, the lead actor (Damian Chapa) is a mockery to bad acting and overacting even more so, y si sabes un poco castellano you will know and laugh at many scenes where they try to capture the essence of being Spanish. Also, words like ""familia"", ""carnal"" and ""vatos locos"" are spoken so many times I started thinking somebody misunderstood the word ""filler"". It's not a bad movie, and Benjamin Bratt almost makes up for his movie brother's poor acting abilities, but the movie just runs for too long without a really satisfying ending. Chapa kind of picks up on his character as the movie goes by (well, he damn sure had more than enough time to redeem himself in this one-oh well) and it is a movie one does not forget that easily, but in the end it wasn't executed in the best possible way and came off as just too much a B-class wannabe smart movie. Worth the watch if you get a kick out of watching really bad acting or if you enjoy crime/gang/prison movies.6/10","Blood In, Blood Out"
13,Li_85,Surprisingly GOOD!!! could of been better if it has Popular Actors.,9,12 June 2006,"Bound by Honor also known as Blood in Blood out is a Half Prison movie and half Action. It tells the story of 3 Close Friends and cousin. It starts of with street gang fights among the Puerta Ricans. After a Bad Incident that takes place, the three of them go their separate ways. Jesse borrego gets Badly injured and becomes a drug addict. Damien Chapa gets caught by the police and ends up in prison. Benjamin Bratt who was once a street thug becomes a Honest police officer. Out of the three, Damien's story is the best. He starts of as a weak character in prison, who almost gets raped and slowly works his way up. After a couple of years, the story moves on to the connection between Benjamin and Damien. The movie has a clever ending, I'm sure I have seen a similar type ending in another movie, cant remember which. Although it is a 3 hour movie, it does entertain. The acting is efficient from the cast. If this had a better and popular starcast, it probably would of been among the Best Movies. Al Pacino or Robert De Niro would of suited in Benjamins role. Keauna Reeves maybe would of suited in Damiens role. Jesse does not have a main role. Overall, I recommend this movie, a good time pass.","Blood In, Blood Out"
14,shanayneigh,I absolutely love this movie,9,30 July 2020,"This movie isn't a guilty pleasure, it's simply a pleasure to watch. Melodramatic and full of hammy acting (here's looking at you, Damian Chapa) but goddamn is it entertaining and full of amazing quotes (whenever a buddy does something weird in traffic, it's still a chicano u-turn to us).I have to be honest and admit that I fast forward through the artist's and most of the cop's story. The bread and butter of this movie is the prison story line and the character of Miklo (I still have a Latina friend who sometimes calls me that name in jest, because I may be white on the outside, but I'm brown on the inside - TO THE BONE!)I must have watched this movie at least a half dozen times, and writing this review makes me want to watch it again.","Blood In, Blood Out"
15,tnrcooper,criminally underrated film,9,4 February 2011,"This film really is a peer of The Godfather. It should be thought of in those terms. Both films track members of a family who are in mob-like organizations. ""Blood In, Blood Out"" tracks the fate of family members involved in gangs but some of whom try to go straight, while The Godfather is more concerned with the internal machinations of the criminal organization.That said, the films tracks several boys who during their youth are parts of illegal criminal families. I think this film is criminally underrated. Both the first and second Godfather films deserve their plaudits and the performances, direction, and script combined to make for compelling inter-generational dramas. However, this film is no different. It does not track such a lengthy period of time, but we see significant character development, multi-layered story lines, and large numbers of peripheral characters who also play important parts in the film.The acting in this film is brilliant from the three leads Benjamin Bratt, Jesse Borrego, and most notably, Damian Chapa. Chapa as Miclo is the light-skinned, blue-eyed Latino whose appearance has always driven him to prove how loyal a Latino he was and which leads him into a lot of trouble. Chapa's performance depicts Miclo as scared and unsure as a youngster, but as he grows older, he becomes more sure of himself and more committed to his lifestyle. Chapa delivers an intense, energetic performance which really should have led to more opportunities for him, had he wanted them. Jesse Borrego as Cruz is a talented artist whose life falls prey to drugs but who survives and doesn't forget his origins and values. Borrego make Cruz an imp with a twinkle in his eye which never goes out, no matter how far he falls and Borrego's performance also shows a great deal of depth. Bratt is Paco, perhaps the most troubled as a youngster, but whose life changes fortuitously before it can spin too far out of control. The three leads are cousins, and their courses in life converge and diverge in interesting and not unrealistic ways.There is great supporting work from actors like Delroy Lindo, Enrique Castillo, Carlos Carrasco, Victor Rivers, and many others. The script and screenplay are fantastic, chronicling about 13 or 14 years with great ease but without sacrificing complexity. The story is based on the experiences of artist Jimmy Santiago Baca and he helped to write the screenplay.For me, the relationships among the races in prison is the most fascinating part of the film. Race defines one's position in prison. The unity of the members of a race will determine how powerful that race is in prison. This is not a film for kids. The violence is not soft-pedaled. It is brutal and unapologetic. Director Taylor Hackford should be applauded for not shrinking from a not particularly feelgood story. He allows the film to breathe and allows the tragedy and triumph to play out. I have read some reviewers critique the length of this film and while I sympathize, I don't know which parts they would remove. I don't find that the film drags at all and the relationships within the family, within racial groups, and between racial groups, make this a film that will withstand repeated viewing.","Blood In, Blood Out"
16,ferdinand1932,Garbage in Garbage Out,1,2 July 2011,"Oh dear...what a mess.This film is so incompetently written that it could be used masterclass in how not to write anything at all. For a start it is repetitive beyond all belief: same riffs on blood ties, brothers, mothers, fathers and cousins etc etc etc ad nauseam throughout. Tedious to a degree that is extraordinary that it passed the producers.Secondly, the script has two pitches: loud and violent. That also makes it very boring. It is obvious how things will be shown in these two modes. A violent film can work on other levels but the writers are so inept that it escaped them to give this a few more tones.Thirdly, the story lacks precision as if it lacked a good editor. Therefore it has adopted the familiar course of amateurs, and that is to add everything in the story without giving it a balance and counter balance. There is no editorial overview of how to shape material within a reasonable time period. It is also very very long ...""Anna Karenina"" is long, but that was by Tolstoy and he has some claim to be one of the greatest writers of all time.Fourthly, the actors: oh well, and the report card is depressing. Basically two modes of action. The leads are all generally terrible, especially Mr Chapa, whose performance might be compared to a guard dog with distemper. Such monotony should not be viewed in a feature film.As with anything that that exemplifies all that is detritus in film making, there are so many other things to mention but space precludes a fuller list of its faults. The music for instance, with its deliberate sentimental Spanish guitar style in the few quiet moments showed all the artistic intelligence of a fast food restaurant franchise.Almost anything on earth is better than wasting the time that is this dreadful waste of one's own too short life.","Blood In, Blood Out"
17,ozjeppe,"Absolutely irresistible crime saga - the ""Godfather"" of the Chicano gang crime genre, indeed!",7,30 November 2007,"Epic, brutal and complex crime saga chronicling two brothers and a cousin who cannot escape the effect that their Chicano heritage & gang commitment has on their lives in L.A. during the '70s and '80s.An absolutely irresistible and surprisingly well-written piece of work that has an understandable cult following. Occasionally over-the-top in melodramatics and performances, but compensates by a narrative pace that almost never flags during its 3 hours length, plus an enthusiasm to entertain and move. The emphatic depiction of the prison world hierarchy is also deeply enthralling. This deserves to be regarded as the ""Godfather"" of the Chicano gang crime genre, indeed! 7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe","Blood In, Blood Out"

19,magellan333,Just plain bad.,3,23 March 2007,"When I started watching this movie, I thought I'd stumbled on some ""overlooked masterpiece"". It seemed to have a really solid beginning. It started it's downhill spiral when the white Hispanic guy goes to prison. Did they use real inmates because it seems none of these guys can act! It was fun to see Billy Bob Thorton as Lightning, but his role is small. I was a good hour and a half into this movie and kept expecting it to wrap up. Finally I looked at the DVD box and thought, ""DAMN! This movies 3 hours long."" As far as I was into it, I decided to ""ride it out"". It never got any better. The dialog is just downright hokey in some spots. It seemed the leader of the Hispanic prison gang was reading his line off a cue card made up of block letters. The lead character wasn't too good an actor either. The detective in the movie, he was good. I've seen him in more recent work and he is a pretty good actor. This movie had the potential to be something really good. They just needed to give the actors a few more lessons, give the writers a little more time to ponder the dialog and maybe shave 30-45 minutes off the final cut. I read in the trivia it was originally 5 hours long. I never could've endured that.","Blood In, Blood Out"

21,fullheadofsteam,Much Too Highly Rated,4,15 March 2018,"The fact that this movie is so highly rated on IMDB is a reflection more on a general public ignorance of gang activities and of prison life. The fact that it provides a weak protagonist who could not successfully become a trusted and strong prison gang member should be obvious, but more important is the rather stupid stereotyping of not only prison life, but of the complexity of prison gang affiliations. Of course the movie goes stereotypically even further in demonizing prison officials, as either unnecessarily mean or corrupt (or both). Too much Hollywood and ridiculous drivel in terms of ""real life"" as to warrant a high rating -- in fact some of the scenes are so obviously contrived and stupidly staged as to relegate this movie to the lower echelons of modern crime and gang-themed films.","Blood In, Blood Out"
22,non_sportcardandy,International brotherhood of vato locos?,8,19 September 2005,"Although I didn't watch this movie straight on through it did impress.There was tension throughout because every verbal confrontation could or did lead to a sticking.At times I thought this movie was on the Spanish channel and felt it might be a problem for a lot of the audience.The Spanish was mainly Pachuco which goes back to at least the 1940's and usually is only spoken by Pachuco's.That being the situation it was surprising to read so many positive comments from persons in the U.K.,Toronto,Israel and many other places.It seems as though modern day audiences are more broadminded and should be complimented for it. Growing up in Oakland in the 1950's and 60's there wern't too many vato locos around just a lot of people that wanted to kick butt,now it's worse.Being far away from east l.a. and a little bit closer to Q I'll still take the liberty to call the main characters veterano's.What they have been doing they have been doing for many years. The one scene that I did not like was when the kid was in the storage room with the aryan boss,the thumb scene.Going along with the flow of the movie I found myself yelling out ""Nel Ese"". Otherwise this was a very interesting movie.Hay te wacho(see you later)","Blood In, Blood Out"

24,momjessicaandjordan,A Great 3 hour movie to stay entertained,8,15 July 2021,"This was actually a good movie. It definitely gets passed the cheesiness. The acting was kinda overdone and the movie was dumbass long like almost 4 hours long probably because I chose the directors cut. I'm stupid some times. Despite Blood in, Blood Out took place in the Mexican Hood in the 70s, it felt very relatable. It was definitely a sad hood movie if you think about it. The moment when they was on the hill changed their whole friendship or you can say the car window changed everything or Meeklo going to prison etc.Most of the characters in this movie were kinda boring and pointless but the ones that stood out. For example, Popeye, Meeklo and his other two friends. They seem the most genuine. I also liked Delroy Lindos character he was the most consistent gang leader, he kept it strong for the most part. Everyone else's gang started getting killed and their plan to takeover went straight out the door. Delroy Lindos character kept the black men strong, well until the end when they all die as well and end up the other gang groups. Solid 8/10 for me.","Blood In, Blood Out"
25,rukstar69,Very underrated.,8,13 March 2021,"I remember watching this on cable as a kid 10-11 years old and liking it. Now that I'm grown, I truly understand what a great film it is. One of the most underrated films ever. Excellent from top to bottom. Acting, Storyline and cinematography. Votos Locos 4ever!","Blood In, Blood Out"
26,mcotto8,Great depiction of the prison gangs of the late 20th century.,8,25 November 2011,"For 3 years, my wife wanted me to watch this movie and i hesitated. It sounded like just another gang movie and i wasn't interested in watching another movie like that. Then when i was sick one day it came on cable and i decided to watch it. As soon as the first 1/2 hour passed, I was sorry I didn't watch it sooner. This movie was well done! A very good depiction of street and prison gangs..(the fact that some of the actors and crew either were involved in gangs or had done time in jail helped make some of the roles more believable).The saddest character in the movie is the main protagonist Miklo Velka. despite his mother being a brown-eyed, blk haired Mexican, his white father's features constantly make him an outsider in his own community and his willingness to do whatever it takes to be accepted by his own people ends up having disastrous consequences for all involved in his life in the 12 years that the film takes place.One other thing I saw in the movie that really surprised me is when Popeye tells Miklo that he cannot get mad at another Latino in jail because they were both from rival gangs. In prison, they have to unite if they want to survive. I saw that as a unity born out of need to protect themselves.If you are Latin, regardless of type (cuban, Puerto-Rican,Peruvian,Mexican etc) see this movie.","Blood In, Blood Out"
27,coloradokid719,Amazing Film,10,1 January 2007,"I'd never heard of this film or seen any press on it, but picked it up in a used-movie bargain bin and thought it looked interesting. I was simply blown away by the ensemble acting and cinematography. The DVD version that I have runs about 3 hours long and it doesn't drag for one second. I remained drawn into the story from beginning to end. The level of realism in the drama that unfolds is eerie. The relationships that are displayed between the characters are impeccably played out. You get a real sense of family between the half-brothers and the cousin (the three ""main"" characters), and see it develop between Miklo and his prison ""familia"" as well. The ""making of"" featurette on the DVD really took me by surprise, and revealed with crystal clarity the depth of Taylor Hackford's vision and motivation to create this cinematic masterpiece. I echo the sentiments of comments I've seen expressing an interest in a full ""director's cut"" (4+ hours) and/or a disc with deleted scenes at the very least. There isn't anything predictable about this film (in my opinion), and it is truly a rare film experience that is full of surprises. For a work of fiction, it is obviously based in real experience, which Jimmy Santiago Baca was able to forge on paper and Taylor Hackford was able to bring to the screen, with no apologies needed or implied.","Blood In, Blood Out"

I know very well the message that is implied in this movie. ""Carnal"" means ""brother."" I'm not dumb enough to not say this. No one in Mexico or that is Mexican that I've known says those words. This is another movie that tries to push that nonsense and annoy the viewers with the nonsense and ram it down our throats. No, ""bro"" is not black or white slang. It has never been. Please if you wanna realistic piece about Hispanics watch ""Carlito's Way"" or ""Scarface"" -- none of that ""brother"" is the same as ""bro"" in either of those movies. This movie is pure nonsense altogether. I'm Hispanic and I find it annoying. Very annoying. Please, smart people, skip this one.","Blood In, Blood Out"

30,jayleshd,Missed Gem,9,16 April 2011,"I enjoy the crime/thriller genre and this really hit the spot. It had action, moral dilemmas, suspense, twists and drama. There is even emotion in this movie and not just a typical gangster movie.After watching this, It opened up my eyes to the life of Spanish/Mexican gangs and the troublesome lives they live. It is a story of innocence, revenge and betrayal. It is also a story of coming of age and learning. Most importantly it is a movie that can deliver powerful messages to the audience whom feels gangsterism is a symbol or status.I applaud the writer, the director and all the actors for producing such a accomplished piece of cinema. The acting is very genuine and all actors feel comfortable in their roles and helps the movies progression. The authenticity is also there and much research has gone into this. Although this is a lengthy film, over 2 hours long, it is well worth the time to watch the story unfold as it would in the real world. Viewers of the movie should be aware some scenes are not for the faint hearted and may cause you to gasp in shock. At one point I even shouted at the screen, but I wont divulge which scene this was.Please watch this movie, if you are thirsty for something different and not commercial, this is the pick.","Blood In, Blood Out"

For my part, I'd like to tell to everyone who likes movie scores that Bill Conti has made a fantastic job in this one. The music of Blood In Blood Out is amazing. It serves really well the ambiance and the spirit of the movie and I don't understand why this score has been so ignored by music amateurs. I dare to compare the chemistry which arose from this collaboration between the images of Taylor Hackford and the music of Bill Conti to the one who was born in the sixties between Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone. Great job Mr. Conti. Thank you for your talent.","Blood In, Blood Out"

The only thing that keeps this movie from being rated higher is its length.  At times it is too drawn out, but for the most part it is well acted, beautifully shot considering the settings, and tells a good story.I have yet to to find a person who doesn't fal in love with this movie.","Blood In, Blood Out"
34,al_gd,A brilliant film,10,29 August 2002,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. The concept of finding ones family, ones place in life, is what this movie is all about. Miklo's struggle to be accepted as a Latino, can only be achieved in prison. This is a very complete movie, and the ending at first seems confusing. To me, the ending is near perfect. Damian Chapa deserves more praise for his role, simply brilliant, Oscar worthy.","Blood In, Blood Out"
35,mikeadriano,Terribly under-rated Epic,10,29 September 2019,"It's an awesome epic worth your time and patience. Some viewers complain that this an American Me rip off and its way too long, yes there are similarities but it is told in a different manner, I thought the 190 minutes(Directors cut) flew by. There are numerous cheesy lines, racial stereotypes and the acting can be over the top, sometimes wooden but its what makes this epic work and enjoyable. A must watch for those who enjoy hood/barrio movies.","Blood In, Blood Out"
36,wroache,Great Movie but Overly Melodramatic,10,17 July 2001,"The first thing one should know about this movie is that it is NOT a remake of ""American Me"" although there are so many similar plot details that it becomes obvious that they ripped off or copied from ""American Me"".Overall, I enjoy ""American Me"" more as a movie depiction of prison gangs. But ""Blood In Blood Out"", is far superior in pure entertainment value, in my opinion.  I have watched it (all 3 plus hours) many times and I have never gotten tired of it.  It is the kind of movie that sucks you in and is hard to press STOP once it gets going.I think that all the actors except one were great, especially Benjamin Bratt, Enrique Castillo, and Jesse Borrego.  It was especially amusing to see good old Billy Bob Thornton, as a neo-Nazi.The only actor that I do not include in the greatness is the more or less star Damian Chapa as Milko.  While other actors in the film had their overacting moments, this guy just wouldn't quit.  Every scene was just way too overdone with him and by the end he was just plain obnoxious.I give this movie a ten in spite of Chapa.  If he had weaker co-stars, that rating would drop because of him but overall the other's superior performances make up for his.Great movie, be sure to check it out.","Blood In, Blood Out"
37,wigz,probably my favorite,10,26 May 2000,"I've seen this movie about twenty times and would gladly watch it again anytime.Literally.Damian Chapa has been robbed of any real recognition for what I think is one of the best performances ever to be put on film.Miklo rules.I've never seen the extended laserdisc,but I'm sure it kicks even more ass. This movie will survive the test of time.","Blood In, Blood Out"
38,johnericbackstrom,The ghetto-Shakespeare,10,13 December 2005,"The basic plot center around these three friends who are like brothers. We watch them turn from boys to men in the Latino ghetto of Los Angeles. The three main characters have the biblical attributes of Sin, Redemtion and Revenge hanging over them. We see them tackle their life in different ways and following different paths. Each path is their own but sometimes they lead to a crossroad.Many people just assume that this is a gangster movie because it contains the ghetto, Chicanos, prison, drugs and violence. But it is so much more. The ghetto is a importent part of their life's but the actual drama could easily been a king's court or something else Shakespearian.Many people I have seen this movie with complains about the acting but even if the actors are poor the characters still seem true. Often the ghetto turns into the fourth main character when we see how alive it really is.This is my all time favorite film. First watched it at a young age about twelve or so. At that moment I found the gang-members to be something ""cool"". When I then got it for Christmas two years back and re-watched I was astounded by the settings, multiple plots and the human drama that occurs. What I found ""cool"" back then was just tragic now and I could now relate more to the other aspects of this movie.","Blood In, Blood Out"

40,phillips-adl,Great watch,8,25 January 2015,"This is an absolute 90's classic! Being a child of the 90's, both film and music-wise, I love this film. Entertaining story of LA gang culture and brotherhood. The acting isn't always completely there but it doesn't actually matter when a film is this much fun to watch. Yes it's a long film but needs to be really - nothing feels unnecessary. The white-boy Hispanic aspect is good to watch and gives the film a certain uncomfortableness. This film had a real feel-good brotherhood vibe running through it and although in some ways cheesy I found it overall to be a gem. Viva Los Pacos Locos! If I was a film buff, I'd stroke my beard and say this film was displeasing due to the fact that it wasn't shot in black and white, wasn't made in the 1950's, wasn't minimalist and not enough ponses rated it, but then again I'm not ;-)","Blood In, Blood Out"
41,officerdonb,Semi actual facts of a Mexican Prison Gang.,9,20 October 2019,"Though it's based on events of Poet Jimmy Santiago Baca it has some factual points of the start of the Mexican Mafia referred to as Las Ondas (not sure spelling) in the movie. The purpose was started to promote solidarity within the Mexican Prisoners. The character of Miklo whose half White half Mexican and becomes the leader of the gang could be substituted for Joe ""Peg Leg"" Morgan a Yugoslavian (Croatian) who was a high ranking leader. Like the character Miklo, Morgan had a prosthetic leg. Another great movie that showed this organization is American Me with William Forsythe playing a similar character.","Blood In, Blood Out"

Don't get me wrong, Chapa has proved to be a fine actor over the years but his performance in this film is almost comical: His eyes flare, he pounds his chest, he over emotes. Chapa presents MiKlo as a caricature.This film is also a good 45 minutes too long and the needless director's cut drags things out even more.Worth checking out if you're a bad film buff, all others stay away.","Blood In, Blood Out"

Growing up together in the barrio of LA seems lightly breezy and carefree unitl one day all three of their lives are devastated.

45,RabanRendon,A bond you can never break said in an unbreakable drama!,8,29 February 2020,"Bound by Honor: Blood in, Blood Out is astonishingly underrated. While it's not an ideal or picturesque film of how American Chicano's should be presented, it's still an excellent drama with superb acting from non-household names. The story unfolds with half-Anglo, half-Chicano Miklo coming back to East LA from Las Vegas where he had a falling out with his father. He is reacquainted with his aunt, uncle and cousins Paco and Cruz. Micklo wants in his cousins' street gang Vatos Locos and will prove himself worthy by any means. One act starts a chain of events that profoundly changes each of their lives. Cruz an upcoming artist, slips into darkness and drug addict limbo. The ever-macho Paco joins the military and becomes an undercover cop. Miklo is initiated into the prison gang La Onda that is the head and overlord organization of all Chicano street gangs. This puts Miklo and Paco at odds against each other.Naturally, the story gets progressively more dramatic and every choice and consequence come to a head with resentment and guilt. For a serious drama, it has some of the funniest banter and vulgar dialogue ever captured in a film. In the end, the message of the film makes it's point, ties are powerful whether blood related or not.","Blood In, Blood Out"
46,a_aleksan,"A great story, from start to end",9,20 July 2008,"When I first saw this movie, I was about 13 and with my friends, we used to imitate many lines from this movie, ""Vatos locos forever"", ""Life is a risk carnale"", etc. I am not of latino descent, but, I was touched by many parts of the story.I think many people make the mistake of associating this movie with being latino or that its a stereotype. I find that the real depth of the story is far beyond just that. This is a movie about acceptance, the need to fit in, the struggles of belonging to a minority, prison gangs, pride, family and the way different people get shaped with time and circumstance. When you start this movie, you can not imagine how far it will go and how the different characters evolve and the acting is great, all the actors picked fit perfectly their roles.There is so much in this movie that I wont go into details, but to briefly explain, the story revolves around three cousins who are all completely different but bound by blood. They all seem to be going on a certain path which becomes radically changed early in the movie when their paths diverge dramatically. Its along these paths that you get a glimpse of society at those times, of hardships, of unfair circumstances and of survival.This is really a great movie, one of my all time favourites. I have watched it probably more than 10 times and will continue to watch it again and again. Enjoy! 9/10","Blood In, Blood Out"

48,LucretiaBorg,Not just another gang movie!!,8,7 April 2005,"I know, the movie isn't original. You have American me, although that one was more the life story of one American-Latino and Blood in Blood out, as I know it, is more the story of three ""brothers"" (one is a cousin, but they're like brothers), also American-Latino (or Mexican) from who only one ends up in jail. It's not only about gangs, prison etc. but also about the lives of immigrant families who loose their kids to the ""American way of life"", but also about family, love, defeat and overcoming your problems, like the oldest brother, who ends up on the better side of life. Ther are movies from Bad Boys to Colours to Boyz in tha Hood and they are all great, but the story is also about ethnicity, gangs from South Central L.A. are nothing like gangs from Hells Kitchen. The race is different, so the people are different too. And that's what makes this movie better than most movies about gangs and such. It's also about race and how it effects the people in the USA, espécially the former immigrant families like the Mexicans.","Blood In, Blood Out"

It even panders to the point of including prolonged prison scenes where a bunch of Latino actors get to wear shirts buttoned to the top, flash a lot of gang signs, and call each other ""ese"" and ""homes"" way too often. The film's design is laughable (the film is supposed to take place from 1973-1984, but all the hairstyles and clothes look early '90's). Worst of all, this turkey honors the age-old insult of having a Caucasian actor (the blank-staring blond robot playing Miklo) as the central character in what is, ostensibly, a Hispanic story.

61,how_long_will_they_mourne_me,Great movie,10,28 November 2004,"Blood In, Blood Out, Bound by Honor (1993) is nothing more than a biggest budgeted cheese fest This movie is a cult classic because of the bad acting, goofy writing and several big stars in small roles hamming up every scene they're in. What made ""American Me"" brilliant is missing in this ""epic"". The direction is pedestrian, the camera work isn't that great and the editing leads a lot to be desired. The actors act in two modes in this one, over or under acting. Sappy and cheesy at the same time isn't very good. When it tries to be melodramatic it seems phony and forced. When the film tries to become serious it's laughable. People want to complain about the lead actor Damian Chapa, he's actually quite good in his role compared to the rest of the cast. At least he shows true emotions. Benjamin Bratt looks like he's either going to laugh over his bad lines or forces himself to look ""determined"" in others. Tom Towles is his usual over the top self. I wish he had a cigar to chomp on and a big mustache he could twirl.Most of the blame can be put on the director. Some of it could be put on the script and the rest on the supporting cast. The film was delayed because they didn't want any violence in the theaters. Maybe it was released too soon after ""American Me"" was finished making it's rounds at the box office. This movie never became a real hit and faded away into obscurity. After editing and re-editing, the finish result is a three hour violent soap opera. Like I said before, it's highly entertaining for all the wrong reasons. Fun stuff, makes a great party tape.Recommended.P.S. The best version out is the 190 minute version. Not only does it expand several scenes but extra violence is added making the movie actually better. But since I'm reviewing the theatrical version.

62,t-kerkhof87,An absolutely mind-blowing surprise,9,10 January 2008,"It is amazing how you can start with no real expectations at all, only to find yourself ending up with a real gem of a movie. That accurately sums up my experience when I first saw Bound by Honor/Blood In Blood Out.Behind the shy, inconspicuous exterior lies a powerful, almost real drama about the lives of three LA gang members who find their world changes as they grow up. Drug addiction, life in prison and 'betrayal' are the main subjects here and they don't fail to demand attention. I must honestly admit that I have watched this movie in awe, until the closing credits were gone. It's that good.Most of the actors aren't that famous (alright, you might recognize Benjamin Bratt for his role in Law & Order) and those who are have no real starring roles. In my opinion, this adds to the 'real feel' of the movie and is one of it's strong points (the casting, that is). Even Damian Chapa isn't bad in this movie (he usually is, think Street Fighter... Or U.S. Seals 2 :S) and I must praise him for his work. Both stars and supporting actors performed magnificently.But in my opinion, the real credit should go to the writer and the director, who made such interesting and real topics in to an engaging, 3-hour long drama that manages to captivate it's audience. A genuine masterpiece, I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone.","Blood In, Blood Out"
63,DigitalPimp1290,The Best,10,25 July 2005,"This is the best movie in the world no questions asked. the story is so inspirational and motivating. it helped me learn to fight what you believe in. even though i am not into gangs but the way they put them together is just brilliant. how all the guys where brothers, and how the things that happened between them changed everything. all three are gang members and then the right hand man, Cruz, became an artist with a drug addiction, the left hand man, Miklo, became in a different game and was in jail for life because he started and was part of a riot in jail, and he was the leader of the gang that caused it, and the leader, Paco, became a police man. the movie is to good to explain and you should see it. trust me. it will be one of the best you will ever see in your life.","Blood In, Blood Out"
64,BizOne,Great Movie,10,29 December 1998,"Personally, this is one of my favorite movies.  It's about three relatives who are in the gang life.  One gets sent to prison, one gets hooked on drugs and the other ends up being a police officer.  The police officer ends up in situations where he has to meet up with some of his old friends from the gang he was in.  The movie is pretty long but there's a lot to it.  If you haven't seen it you should check it out.","Blood In, Blood Out"
65,tank-17,A powerful story of brothers trapped in the Los Angeles gang scene.,10,22 November 1999,"I encountered this movie on late-night cable one evening, and was completely blown away.  The character development in the film is refreshingly full, and the acting in the movie is outstanding, from both lead characters and supporting cast.The one possible downside to this movie is it's long length (3 hours) however the movie is so full, that there are no real lulls in the story.Use the washroom before it starts, make a little extra popcorn, and bring an extra coke or beer, since once this movie starts, you're liable to be hooked.","Blood In, Blood Out"
66,cwbyrudy,An All Time Great Film,10,16 August 2019,This film is a top 3 favorite of mine because of it's ability to relate to me and many in the Hispanic communities in the US. The three perspective format that was shown was genius and spectacularly done. The actors were realistic in their depictions of the emotions that are endured in the types of situations they found themselves in. The ending scene still gives me chills and I've seen this movie at least fifty times.,"Blood In, Blood Out"
67,Fetisha,"Story of 2 Chicano brothers and their half Latino cousin and how they grow up in a world of drugs, prison and street gangs.",9,17 August 2001,"I thought this movie was incredible. It was an excellent portrayal of the Latino culture and their family. It never got boring, though I found the prison scenes most interesting, it was a good idea to lay the focus of the movie in that area. The actors were great as well. Of course, Benjamin Bratt is an incredible actor and was excellent in his role. Jesse Borrego was good in his part as well, he made his drug-addicted character likeable and funny.Then there's Damian Chapa. I thought he did an excellent job as the lead in this movie. He was perfect for the role and seemed to make the movie more intriguing. The only thing that I could say to sum up his part, is that the part almost seemed made for him. I would definitely recommend this movie next time you go to rent something.","Blood In, Blood Out"
68,masta78,Great movie,9,6 August 2008,"Picture yourself and your brother in the world full of anger and hate, where the drugs and money rules, standing on the opposite sides. What would you do? Would you still be brothers? This is a story about following the rules in life, honor, respect, family and decisions, sometimes dramatic, we have to make. It teaches us that no matter the skin color you are - it's the heart you got inside. You can't escape your destiny... No special effects, no bull***t - pure entertainment. A must see! I've seen it like 10 times but still it makes an impression. One of my favorites. This is one of few movies I can recommend in 100%.

69,Wong_Fei_Hong,very good,9,16 January 2003,"i thought the storytelling was excellent.  there was plenty to like in this movie.  i forgot that Billy Bob Thornton was in it - Bratt, Chapa, Lindo, Cruz, Borrego, and Castillo were all servicable in their roles.  my biggest complaint was Victor Rivers, who played Magic Mike.  where was his accent? there's one scene in the movie that's so hilarious, they are having a discussion amongst the gang, most everyone is saying things like Horale ese, and Simon que si, and Rivers says in his Costneresque non-accented response - ""We're making a big mistake!"".  all in all a very entertaining movie.","Blood In, Blood Out"

71,smbabur911,Three brothers get involved in gang wars and drugs in East LA 1972 and have their life turned upside down and have to part.,7,16 July 2013,"EPIC. Thats right. It really is epic at least when you consider the length. 190 minutes of drama which encompasses 13 years and many twists and turns. It was like seeing a movie twice over. And its pretty hard for me to sit and do the same thing that long. But thank god it was nice or i would have been lying on the bed all day with a headache. And it amazes me that I sat through a movie that long without much fuss. It was pretty nice. The LA which many outsiders never see or hear about. The east LA, the gang wars, the drugs, inmates running the prisons and rape attempt on a white prisoner. And thirteen years of twist and turns in the fortune of the three brothers and their familias as tragedy and happiness went hand in hand of a community which just wanted to live and work with dignity as some of their own went the wrong way and destroyed their careers and lives. And with much of the second half happening in the prison it needed a good genuine drama which thankfully is delivered. The prison and the stories feel real. And you feel destroyed as you see criminals getting criminalized in an institution made to reform them. Gay cooks and prisoners and racially segregated groups which ran their business from the inside in lieu of money. Attacks being planned and committed on fellow prisoners. Its all there as it takes a lot out of you to watch and absorb all this and more for more three hours. But all said and done it engrosses you for most the time and its only in the middle when not much is happening when you look at the time remaining. But as the plotting and action starts you again get absorbed. I got out with a real good knowledge of the people and a side of one of my favorite cities I never knew about. For that I am happy that I watched this.Read more at: http://hightensionmovies.blogspot.in/","Blood In, Blood Out"
72,mrminimite,"A ""love it or hate it"" type of flick",9,28 June 2005,"Bound By Honor (BBH) is not meant to legitimize or glorify gang life, or ennoble Latino culture. It simply tells a story that faithfully paraphrases harsh reality. If you don't get the story, then it's easy to lambaste the acting and directing. If you do get the story, then the acting and directing are good enough.Many of the film's characters are people we know: Cruz, full of verve and potential, a victim of the needle; his father, a working class Chicano who wanted better for his sons; Miklo, the fresh-faced well-intentioned misfit driven inexorably to a life of brutality; Paco, the handsome athlete rescued from ruin by the Marine Corp; Juanito, the ""mocoso"" of the family, whom everybody wanted to protect from the perils of the barrio, tragically cut down nonetheless; Miklo's mom, a party girl ill-prepared to be a mother; Miklo's aunt - strong and responsible - called on to be a mother to her sister's son.The prison scenes and subplot are quite visceral. Some people find them laughable or unbelievable, but I find them to be neither. Some liberties were taken, but for the most part, I thought prison gangs, corruption, killings, rape, parole boards, and trade were depicted quite well.There are also universal themes: The meanings of home and family; hard but honest work versus a life of crime; the fickle consequences of youthful foolishness, striking down some while letting others pass; unfulfilled hopes, and other hopes fulfilled in unexpected ways; a family torn apart by tragedy with only time to heal the wound; the struggle to right one's ship; generational gaps bridged only by maturity that comes in the wake of mistakes; the constant questioning of oneself.It would have been nice to see more character development of women in the family, and some of the actors should have worked on their accents and delivery a little more. Still, I highly recommend this film to anybody in search of a story like the one it tells. To those who don't feel particularly strongly about the material covered, I'd say BBH is no worse than almost any recent big budget film. But to those inclined to greet the *underlying story* with folded arms and a dismissive grin or snort, I'd say spend your three hours watching something else. My verdict: 9 of 10 stars.Now I'll address some points raised by those who say the film is garbage.1) ""It was too long."" It was long, yes, but there's very little I'd have left on the editing room floor. I think if one finds the subject material interesting, then the film moves along nicely, despite its length. Also, I think it's hilarious that so many people who despise the film actually watched the whole darn thing! Any flick that keeps you watching for 3 hours can't be too bad.2) ""Damian Chapa is too white to play a Latino."" First, people who say this misunderstand what it means to be Latino, and second, they miss an important subplot. Chapa is a *Spanish* surname, and if Damian Chapa is Latino, then by definition, he's not too white to play one. Latinos of mixed ethnicity are not some Hollywood phantasm, and the treatment of mixed ethnicity and Americanization is a recurring theme in Latino culture in the USA. In the film, Chapa's character is of mixed ethnicity, and as such constantly has to prove he is ""Raza"" in a way that his peers never do. This constant challenge to his identity makes him fearless and quick to the draw, lest those whose approval he seeks question the make of his blood. For example, that's why *he* is the one to first confront Tres Puntos, not his fellow Vatos Locos. In a culture where fair hair, skin, and eyes are at times a liability, he proved his worth by the only measure his peers valued.3) ""The acting was over the top."" Some of the acting that seems over the top is actually not. Gang members quickly learn to communicate by force of will. Also, they are not generally educated or refined, and in their own parlance, one word can mean many things. So the frequent displays of machismo are not necessarily bad acting, and hearing ""ese"" and ""carnal"" repeated over and over is not necessarily bad directing, and the convicts' corny one-liners are not meant to be the witty banter of NPR... but yeah, the film could have been toned down a little in some places.4) ""It wasn't true to the time period."" Critics said the same thing about Doctor Zhivago, but a good film transcends that, and I believe BBH does. The film covered from ~1970 to ~1985, and I had no problem with the settings. Whatever time period mistakes were made weren't bad enough to distract me from the film.5) ""BBH is a cheap rip-off of American Me (AM)."" I saw BBH before I saw AM, so I wasn't predisposed to dismiss BBH as a knockoff. I think AM is depressing and clinical, whereas BBH is uplifting and colorful. Both films cover the same reality and so of course will overlap at points. The same can be said of films about the Vietnam War or the Old West, except that because there are relatively few films about Latinos, the comparison of these two is inevitable. AM is more polished, but BBH is more riveting, probably because BBH makes you care about its characters more. If AM is a sad docudrama with all the loose ends tied up, then BBH is an emotional roller coaster with many questions unanswerable and others simply left unanswered.","Blood In, Blood Out"

This is my all-time favourite movie. It tells the story about 3 blood brothers that start out in east L.A. There they get into a lot of trouble when defending they're Barrio. Miclo get's shot and are sent to San Quentin, Paco decides to join the core (army) and Cruze (the VERY promising artist) gets strung out on drugs that results in his smaller brother's overdose. From here, everything gets worse. (For the three brothers)This movie is a MUST SEE kinda movie.","Blood In, Blood Out"
74,vortex7800,Possibly one of the best movies to date,10,29 June 2000,"This is one of the most powerful movies I ever had the pleasure to lay my eyes on.  From start to finish it had my full attention.  The plot was captivating and the acting was great, a very rare combination. The story revolves around 3 people (2 brothers and a cousin)in East LA. All because of one event in their lives, they are torn apart and each person goes their own separate paths.  One becomes a police officer, one a convict, and the other becomes strung out on drugs.  Even though they split, and to some degree become enemies at times, the movie shows that sometimes the strongest bond is family. I don't want to say much more about the movie, but if you ever have around 3 hours free, this movie is definitely worth seeing.","Blood In, Blood Out"

It is about the way you think and respond for those in need of you. How do you live you life and what thinking you will take from this movie are up to the viewer. These paths are presented in every cornerstone of your life. I say don't rate this until after you have seen the movie. You might have to watch it over and over to really see the movie. If you see a movie for stunts and special effects this not your movie. These are stories for the undecided in life. For those of you who have prejudicial feelings about gangs I ask you to view this with an open mind because you will learn the mentality and take a mentality with you that will open your eyes.

79,phil-glickman,Trivia and analysis,10,19 October 2006,"I think this movie is great and I'll tell you why. But first some trivia: The AV is based in the AB gang called the Aryan Brotherhood. Their members are known and respected in prisons for being especially murderous and ruthless though having smaller numbers than the other gangs. The BGA is based on the BGF black gorilla family gang (Delroy Lindo did a great job as Bonafide). They are a real gang and they claim to be politically motivated and are interested in black power. La Onda, as previously stated in another comment is based on ""La Eme"" or the Mexican Mafia. The members must deny its existence just like the real mafia or face death. These really are the three gangs that run the prisons in LA and across the country to this day. Also the concept of prison violence spilling onto the streets is a real issue. most gang violence in LA is Black on Black or Hispanic on Hispanic but when there is a war in the jails that is the main time that there is interracial violence on the streets. This is depicted well in the movie. More trivia: The Tres Puntos gang is based on a tattoo that many Hispanic gangs get with 3 dots. They signify the three possible ways out of a gang: prison, hospital, and death. The only flaw to this movie is that the actors may have overacted a little. This genre of movies rarely lends itself to great acting opportunities. think of the other great movies of its type e.g. Boyz in the hood, new jack city, menace to society. none of them won awards for best actor. but what sets this apart is that none of them touched on the jail aspect as much as this one did. The other nice thing was that nothing horrible happened at the end. Arguably everyone ended up alright, which is rare in this genre. Miklo became the boss of a powerful gang and spread the gang to other prisons, and Paco and Cruzito became friends again. On a side note, the slang used in this movie may be my favorite part.","Blood In, Blood Out"
80,oblongboxmail,Excellent,10,7 May 2007,"This film is a really masterpiece of Mr. Taylor Hackford! This movie is a reality theme of the prisons life and the life of the Latin peoples in America. The story is fluency. Its elaboration is fantastic. You can slip into the characters life and you can find the emotions in their feat. The pictures about the city, the music and the action are live in an enthusiastic fluctuation. The spiritual attitude is going to seduce everybody. The complexity of the characters is brilliant. Sometimes the story looks like too hard but this is only way of illustration the reality of the prison life. Damian Chapa, Jesse Borrego and Benjamin Bratt made an excellent acting in this drama.","Blood In, Blood Out"

OK, one might argue that it is rather cheap in the budgetary sense and consequently not a respectable director nor actors are in it makes the flick only more interesting. The acting is however quite good and the prisoners are more than realistic. In other words it gives a nice insight in US (prison-gang)life. On top of that i personally am a great fan of true stories as this is. it is a shame that bad distribution has not given this the place in movie history that it deserves.","Blood In, Blood Out"

From the ' Homies from a rough part of town learning the meaning of unity and family' plot, to the godawfull dialog. Too much ""we gotta stick together, homes!"", ""i'll never forgive you, you killed my brother!"", and ""ITS NOT THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN, IT'S WHAT'S INSIDE THAT COUNTS!!!"" for my liking,thankyouverymuch.The Cliché alarm was going nuts on this one, i tell you.Thirdly, it was all so sickeningly heartwarming, or at least it tried to be.

Apparently we need another ""BUT I LOVE YOU BROTHER!!!"" scene.Fourth, DID I MENTION IT WAS THREE HOURS LONG?!?!?!?!?! oh yeah, sorry.I'm sure that everyone in england (sorry rest of the world) will understand me when i say:Basically, this film is nothing more than a latino homeboy version of the ""One woman's struggle"" films that BBC2 puts out at midnight EVERY FREAKIN NIGHT.It is that bad, believe me, it will save you three hours watching time, plus the inevitable two days of ""I can't believe I actually sat all the way through that film"" that will follow.My intelligence feels raped.","Blood In, Blood Out"

From the opening titles to the closing lines and credits, Blood In Blood Out is a complete masterpiece. How it was overlooked and didn't get the recognition it deserves is an indication of how the movie industry operates.
Whether you enjoy the gang / prison movie genre or not, this movie will touch you, even if only from a cinematic perspective. It is a genuine work of art.Some may criticise the acting and certain elements of the gang members' dialogue. Which would be highly unfair. It's raw and real. It would've been more unrealistic had those aspects of the dialogue been ""perfectly scripted and acted"" if that makes sense. Again, it's raw and real, as if acted by real gang members in an amateur dramatics class.Bill Conti (Rocky) composed the film score for this movie.

Brilliantly written, though I believe it should have been directed by someone of Chicano descent.Taylor is not in touch with the Chicano culture, thus creating a movie extrapulating a quasi-anglo feel. A definite must see. The names have been changed to protect the innocent. For instance, La Onda is really La EME (Mexican Mafia), Arian Vanguard (Arian Brotherhood), Black Gorilla Army (Black Gorilla Family). Movie was filmed in the streets of East L.A. and San Quintin.

Finally, if you like gang movies and prison movies, you should definitely see this one because it's a mix of the two...I would recommend watching this one with a group of friends, no doubt you'll be referring to each other with ""vato loco"",""homes"", or ""essay"" for the next few weeks...","Blood In, Blood Out"
98,Callum_fl07,Watch it!!,9,19 March 2013,"Picked this up at a wal-mart, always had a liking to gangster movies based in L.A but had heard little about Blood in Blood out so wasn't too sure if it would be that good, but have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time! I not only rate it up there with L.A gangster movies but with the likes of gangster movies Scarface, Goodfellas, Casino etc. It is that good! It just doesn't have World class actors like Pacino in, but never the less the actors involved are fantastic at their roles, The director/producers deserve credit too because every detail about this film is perfect, the setting, the locations, the lingo used and even the extras look exactly how you would expect hardened Mexican/Black/White prisoners to look. Danny Trejo is in this and he along with the others makes you feel like you are actually in San Quentin. I HIGHLY Recommend this to anyone that likes gangster movies or interested in American prisons and the history of prison gangs, I definitely will be watching this over and over and just wish I discovered it earlier, if anyone knows anymore movies like this with actors like Borrego, Trejo etc please let me know","Blood In, Blood Out"
99,agalaviz2,My Favorite Movie,10,17 November 2004,"I love this movie. I saw it when it was still at the movies. I wished it would of kept going. My buddies and I would go out drinking and say the lines word for word all night. Then we would go back to the house and watch the movie. My friends and I were so into that movie that we flew to L.A. and went looking for a lot of the sites used in the movie. Every place except the prison of course. It was the coolest thing I had ever done. I'm planing on going again with some family members this time. My wife's cousin lives 130 miles from here but, we're always on the phone or e-mailing each other saying something about this movie. There's not a day that goes by that I don't say something from that movie. This is the best movie I've ever seen. VATOS LOCOS 4 EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Blood In, Blood Out"
100,jasperstaal86,Cinderellaaaaa why don't you get a fellaaaaahh!!,10,23 April 2013,"I have seen this movie way too many times, its a true cult classic. 3 hours of brilliant (and sometimes corny) mobstermania.Miklo is a great character, and the surrounding cast is equally great. The 90's vibe oozes out of every frame, and there are so many memorable scenes, its hard to name the best.Although its fair to say the prison parts are very amusing and might belong to the movie's best moments. its not the best movie ever made by far, but for fans of the genre its a very memorable and highly amusing movie i have watched countless times and enjoyed every time. Great characters, great atmosphere, hilarious scenes and a 3 hour journey through a pretty well written story.Cult classic, gotta watch it every 5 years.","Blood In, Blood Out"
101,dools58,"Not underrated, nor overrated",8,19 February 2008,"For all those who give this movie a 10 or a 0 rating, please relax. This movie is not anywhere close to Godfather 1 or 2, but neither is it anywhere near Elm Street. The key thing for this movie is that anyone who is close to a brother (sister) or cousin will have a string attraction if one of them was not, how shall I say, legit. Men will like (love or hate) this movie based one its relationships between its dirty and clean wing. (FYI - I like to love this movie). When Miklo goes bad, he does it for Paco. When Paco goes good, he does it for what he did to Miklo. Great story, aLa E.H. (check 50 short stories for a check). Great movie, great acting, more important story about institutionalism.","Blood In, Blood Out"
102,munecasistema,Best movie ever,10,18 May 2015,"Best movie ever. I think this movie is the one movie out of all that has the most epic quotes. There are even web pages devoted to quotes from blood in blood out. I am aware the actors are not up there with De Niro, Pacino and company but fact remains they helped create some of the most memorable characters in movie history. Who can forget characters like Popeye, Spider, Big Al or the troubled artist Cruzito! Also I think this movie appeals to something else than the wannabe gangster within us. It speaks of the sphere between cultures, the ""in betweeners"". Main character Milko is, as Montana tells him, ""stuck in the middle."" He struggles with being both ""white"" and Chicano. This movie really was a favorite back when I was a kid and to this day I still watch it from time to time and let it bring me back to East Los Angeles in the seventies. And did I mention the never ending source of quotes? ""Hey Cinderella, go find yourself a fella"", ""I don't want his pork-chop, I want his life"", ""cuidado con el Chorizo we might need it for later"" just to name a few of very legendary quotes this movie has left the world with.","Blood In, Blood Out"
103,libre-71305,is OK,6,21 June 2016,"The East L.A. milieu and some of the characters seem familiar, because some of the same ground was covered by ""American Me,"" the fiery 1992 film about Chicanos and prison by Edward James Olmos, who directed himself in the lead. ""Bound by Honor"" covers similar material in a less passionate and finally less meaningful way. Olmos would not have been capable, for example, of this film's evasive final shot, in which Paco and Cruz do a dance together in front of a mural showing them at the beginning of their lives - while the camera, in a helicopter, climbs gradually into the sky to manufacture a false feeling of conclusion for the film.""Bound by Honor"" contains some effective performances, some moments of deeply felt truth, and a portrait of prison life that I assume is accurate. What seems to be missing is a clear idea of why the movie was made, and what the director, Taylor Hackford, wanted to say with it. The outcome of the hero's life leads us to the ancient lesson that power corrupts. But we knew that. And if power had not corrupted Miklo, his life would still have been a wasted one. There are no role models in this nihilistic story.Much of the movie shows a prison world where guards and officials essentially stand aside while prison gangs run the institution, distribute favors, make rules and enforce their laws with violence. The prisons are divided into three camps: the Chicanos, the blacks and the whites, who are of course portrayed as racist, although in fact they're exactly as racist as the others. Few prisoners of any race in this film can imagine themselves outside the roles assigned by their color. Their myopia is underlined by the enigma of the hero, who is not as brown as he thinks he should be.The gangs rule through uneasy truces and alliances, and the central purpose of Miklo's life is to bring about an alliance between the Hispanics and the blacks, to crush the power of the whites. Miklo works at first with the leader of the Chicanos, and then, benefitting from the treachery of another, he becomes their leader himself. His acquiescence in treachery is rather surprising, since it doesn't seem prepared for in the film.Olmos, in ""American Me,"" seemed more saddened and angered by the realities of street crime, gangs and prison life. If the goal of ""Bound by Honor"" is authenticity, that was merely the starting point for Olmos. He tried to show a character learning and growing - discovering that there is more to life, and more to being a person, than simply lining up with those who are like you, in order to hate those who are not like you.Hackford has said in interviews that ""Bound by Honor"" is an attempt to show the actual realities of Chicano life in East Los Angeles. But the movie essentially just does a good job of showing us the externals that regular moviegoers, TV viewers and newspaper readers have already seen. What ""Bound by Honor"" lacks is a vision to bring meaning to the material. Life can certainly be meaningless, but art can sometimes suggest ways in which we can understand it.The movie's lack of purpose is all the more disappointing because Hackford has directed a well-made film. The performances in all of the supporting roles have the ring of absolute authenticity, although Damian Chapa, in the lead, seems too introspective and passive. The narcissism and weakness of his character would be better suited to a major supporting role; he could be best friend, not hero, except that this film doesn't have a hero.Among the others, Delroy Lindo stands out as a black elder statesman among the prisoners (he was the Harlem crime kingpin East Indian Archie in ""Malcolm X""). And Enrique Castillo, as the older Chicano prison gang boss who Miklo feels moves too slowly, gives a performance of depth and honesty - we feel that he understands the situation, instead of simply reacting to it.Miklo's two ""brothers,"" the policeman Paco (Benjamin Bratt) and the artist Cruz (Jesse Borrego), seem to contain complete stories within themselves; cutting to them from Miklo's story, we enter other, intriguing worlds. But Miklo, at the center of everything, is called upon to carry too much of the screenplay's assorted baggage.If he is confused, it is because his makers are; faced with a situation that seems made out of tragic dead ends, they do not know where to go with it, and so neither does Miklo.","Blood In, Blood Out"
104,angelvidales,Bound By Honor,10,27 August 2005,"For whatever reason this movie was first introduced as Bound By Honor then later change to Blood in Blood Out. I'm thirty years old now and find this movie fascinating in many ways. In 93 when the movie first screen I was 18 years old straight out of high school and I love it as much now as I did then. Growing up in LA, I'm compelled and must give credit to the directors and producers for the accuracy/ relevancy in which they represent Los Angeles in the 70's/80's. This movie has many underlying tones and other than the fact that this movie is geared by no Mexican or Chicano actors (Paco Peruvian and Cruz Puerto Rican) this movie is a hit.

105,bluebear_55-1,Wish I could learn Spanish from these guys,10,20 September 2005,"With a title like - ""Blood in, blood out""* I thought this movie was going to be a joke - it was anything but. I can't say enough about how good this movie is. To all who have not seen it - rent and watch it today! * ""Blood in, blood out"" - I would later learn the significance of it, as you'll too, if you decide to watch it. The one-liners are such a treat. With many of them containing surprising truths. Lastly, was it just me, or did anyone else start talking like the characters ten minutes into the watching the film! There's such a roll to the way the words sound. You just know what they mean even if you can't speak a word of Spanish. I wish I could learn Spanish from these guys - then no one would mess around with me!","Blood In, Blood Out"
106,acidjazz90,Poor acting ruins the movie,3,29 March 2006,"Immediately, the movie drove me nuts with poor acting. I tried my hardest to ignore this and actually started to get into the movie. However, there was a point in the movie when the white guy just completely ruined it with his persistent wannabe Mexican attitude / accent. I tried very hard to look past this, but the other actors were just as bad and got my mind diverted from what was really going on. I really think the story has potential, but it was poorly acted / directed. It has been rated rather high here so I say give it a watch to see if you agree / disagree with my comments. I think its pretty obvious that the acting is so poor that its hard to really give credit to this movie. Perhaps this opinion may be a bit shallow but sometimes it's hard to get by.","Blood In, Blood Out"
107,preciousbabi420,Blood in Blood Out,8,22 December 2005,"My sister and her boyfriend were telling me about the movie, and i knew it was the type of movie i would like. So I told my boyfriend that we needed to see it.In my opinion it was thought out well, and filmed good. Some people may not understand the movie, because some of it is in Spanish, but its kind of self explanatory.I thought that it touched on the Vatos Locos lifestyle.And for people who aren't aware of it could learn from it. What they said or portrayed of them was basically how it REALLY is.I would recommend this movie to others.","Blood In, Blood Out"
108,kashmir140,hi,10,25 May 2007,"Horrible acting my Miklo, cant believe he was the main character. Benjamin Bratt was great, a professional actor. It was a really long movie but not boring. Much better than I expected. 7.5 is a fair rating for it, it shouldn't be higher than that. Shawshank Redemption is still better, someone actually compared this to it. The main reason has to be the acting, Morgan Freeman alone is a better actor than any one in blood in blood out. Billy bob Thornton was good. What else can I say about this movie to take up the 10 lines necessary to post my comments. I don't know why there is a 10 line rule anyway. I was finished after 3 lines but now I have to keep on babbling to make up the 10 stupid lines.","Blood In, Blood Out"
109,kgb3269,excellent story line and plot....,9,16 June 2006,Definitely one of my favorite films ever. Also a very underrated film. I was turned on to this movie by a Latino roommate I once had who experienced and or witnessed some of the events similar to those that take place in this film. Outstanding depiction of gang life both in and out of prison. An excellent representation of the distance people will go in order to stick together and survive. Interesting how the 3 boys start their lives together. They all go their own ways then are thrown back together by circumstance. A great look into Spanish culture. Not the best acting that I have seen in a film. However the story is based on the real lives of former gang members and criminals. Many of the actors in the film come from violent and crime filled backgrounds. An outstanding film overall!,"Blood In, Blood Out"
