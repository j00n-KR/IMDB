0,MartinHafer,highly stylized and silly,5,1 August 2005,"Apart from the fact you get to see Catherine Deneuve naked and a few interesting story elements, this isn't a particularly great film. It's definitely an odd take on vampire films for several reasons: there is a weird 80s New Wave style about the vampires, they don't always pierce the victims' throats with their teeth (but use knives to slash them and lap up the blood) and the whole idea of what happens to the lovers of the vampires as the years pass is creepy and cool (more about that in a minute). It seems that the human lovers of these vampires DO live forever, too--but their bodies continue to grow more and more and more decrepit over time. You find out in the end ALL this female vampire's older lovers are in LIVING bits and pieces in coffins in the attic! Yech!! It's even more cool when they all come out in the end and demand her love--really CREEPY folks. Generally, though it seems there is a lot more style over real substance here. Apart from these elements, the story itself is a bit dull and too ""hip"" for the average viewer.",The Hunger
1,Leofwine_draca,Too self-consciously arty for its own good,4,8 October 2016,"Despite being a fan of vampire movies - particularly the older ones given that there's not much originality in the genre today, the odd gem like LET THE RIGHT ONE IN aside - it took me a long time to finally watch THE HUNGER, Tony Scott's dream-like vampire tale starring the one and only David Bowie.Having just watched the movie, I can report that it was a big disappointment for me. Scott is all about the music video visuals here and nothing else. The film is slow, dream-like, and completely insubstantial. Yeah, I get the repression, the eroticism, the languidity of being around for hundreds of years and the emotions that entail. But this kind of subject matter had previously been done better in the likes of DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS, and I wasn't impressed.The film does have some good elements. Bowie is a perfect choice for the male vampire and his ageing scene is very good. Susan Sarandon is always an convincing character when she goes from an ordinary person to someone indoctrinated into a bizarre world (shades of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW here). There are some very bloody moments and the sex scenes are well handled. But it's all so annoyingly arty and look-at-me attention-seeking, I didn't care for it much at all.",The Hunger
2,SnoopyStyle,good style but no thrills,5,29 June 2015,"Egyptian vampire lady Miriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve) is about to rid herself of her present lover John (David Bowie) like so many others before him. He is rapidly aging and falling apart. In desperation, he seeks the help of famous Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon) and her boyfriend Tom (Cliff De Young) who are researching rapid aging in primates.This movie is filled with good moody atmosphere and interesting style. However the story moves so slowly with Bowie trudging along as an old man. One could really fall asleep watching this. It is truly shocking that action director Tony Scott made this. Maybe he learned what not to do from this movie. But it does look good.",The Hunger
3,claudio_carvalho,Stylish Vampire Movie- Love Is Eternal While It Lasts,9,25 March 2007,"In New York City, the lovers Miriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve) and John (David Bowie) are vampires that survive through time under the Egyptian symbol of Ankh. When John starts an accelerated aging process, he seeks the specialist Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon). However, he does not survive, and Miriam selects Sarah to be her next lover.""The Hunger"" is one of the best vampire movies ever made. I recall when I saw this movie for the first time, in an art cinema in Rio de Janeiro, and later at least three times on VHS. Now on DVD, this stylish film improves with the fantastic melancholic and artistic atmosphere, with a magnificent music score and wonderful cinematography. This movie is totally underrated in IMDb since it is one of the most beautiful vampire movies ever made, actually a masterpiece of the genre. Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie and Susan Sarandon have overwhelming performances in this unforgettable movie. The remarkable scene of the lesbian love of Miriam and Sarah is among the most erotic in the cinema history, never being vulgar. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Fome de Viver"" (""Hunger for Living"")",The Hunger
4,classicsoncall,"""The bats have left the bell tower...""",6,16 October 2016,"Still waiting to catch David Bowie in a good movie, as his list of screen credits is small but decent enough. I didn't care for ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" or the Italian Western ""Il Mio West"", and now this one makes it three in a row. Actually, Bowie's not in this film all that long, his character John Blaylock ages into decrepitude rather quickly and ominously when he wears out his welcome with vampire supreme Miriam (Catherine Deneuve). The early premise of the story built around Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon) and her research team studying the effects of sleep on the aging process was kind of interesting. I would liked to have had that theme explored a bit more after the crazy monkey killed Betty and ate her. Swear to God, that's in the movie.The reviewers who graded this film highly actually have some good arguments regarding it's artistic merits but this one just didn't do it for me. The best I can point to is the stylized cinematography and rather cool opening 'Bela Lugosi is Dead' treatment, but after that the murky story gets a tad gruesome, even for mature audiences. Sad to say, even well accepted vampire lore gets thrown overboard more than once each time Miriam sees her own reflection in a mirror.",The Hunger
5,gavin6942,Not What I Was Expecting,6,13 October 2015,"Miriam, a centuries-old vampire, preys on urban clubgoers with her vampire lover John. When John suddenly ages and wastes away, Miriam casts her spell upon Sarah, a doctor who researches premature aging.I figured with Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie, this had to be a home run. Deneuve is an incredible actress, and Bowie has had some impressive roles. And usually very quirky ones: alien, goblin king, Andy Warhol. But we did not get much of him here.I don't know if this was just trying to be too mainstream or what, but it was not what I was looking for, and was not super excited about it. In fact, I found it rather challenging to pay attention, which is no compliment.",The Hunger
6,Woodyanders,A very sexy and stylish 80's vampire horror winner,8,16 March 2012,"Centuries old Egyptian vampiress Miriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve at her most gorgeous, spellbinding, and serenely chilling) and her husband John (splendidly played by David Bowie) live an opulent lifestyle in a posh townhouse in New York City. However, John like all of Miriam's previous lovers suddenly ages into a wizened old man after 300 years, so Miriam decides to replace him with strong-willed geriatric research specialist Sarah Roberts (an excellent performance by Susan Sarandon).Director Tony Scott brings a hypnotic high-gloss panache to this inspired and intoxicating cinematic blend of decadence and elegance. Moreover, Scott pulls off several stunning set pieces: the Goth rock group Bauhaus performing the terrific song ""Bela Lugosi is Dead"" while Miriam and John search for victims in a swanky nightclub, John rapidly aging while waiting to speak to Sarah at the research center, and a gloriously macabre climax in which Sarah's spurned and rotting ghoul past lovers exact a fitting revenge on her for neglecting them. The script by Michael Thomas and Ivan Davis poignantly addresses the basic need for companionship and offers an admirably fresh and unique take on the standard premise of vampirism (these ageless immortals can walk around in the sunlight and use small daggers to cut open the throats of their victims because they don't have fangs). The sound acting by the able cast rates as another significant asset: Deneuve, Sarandon, and especially Bowie are all first-rate, with sturdy support from Cliff De Young as Sarah's concerned boyfriend Tom Haver, Dan Hedaya as pesky homicide detective Lt. Allegrezza, and Beth Ehlers as brash teenager Alice Cavender. Popping up in nifty bits are Ann Magnuson as a victim and Willem Dafoe and John Pankow as a couple of menacing punks who accost Sarah at a phone booth. The famous lesbian love scene between Deneuve and Sarandon is genuinely erotic while the moments of sudden grisly violence are quite startling. Stephen Goldblatt's sumptuous cinematography gives the picture an exquisitely chic and dazzling look. The pulsating score by Michel Rubini and Denny Jaeger hits the funky spot. Worthy of its cult status.",The Hunger
7,rmax304823,"Pretty music, people, blood",5,27 January 2002,"That title about sums it up for me. A gorgeous film filled with handsome people, beautiful decor, rivers of technicolor red number nine, and music by Delibes. But you might as well be crazed with battery acid while watching it if you expect it to make any sense. The story, what there is of it, has already been outlined. But what about those mad monkeys at the beginning? What does the ""manic monkey"" have to do with anything? OLD monkeys, yes. Well, maybe. I still don't know how the deteriorating monkey has anything to do with the story, especially when it not only grows old instantaneously but decomposes into dust in a jiffy.How can Deneuve promise anyone ""eternal life"" when her previous lover, David Bowie, comes to look pretty dead after a while? And what, exactly, is ""eternal life"" if Deneuve can fall a couple of flights and not only get old pronto but die and turn skeletal while screaming. If the vamps need to feed their hunger for blood in order to keep from aging, then why does David Bowie not turn back into his old Etonian self after slaughtering the young violinist and presumably sucking her blood? There are gouts of that cute kid's blood all over the sheet music. What was wrong with her blood. Was it corky?And what about the skater who is a Tiny Tim lookalike? The ending I won't bother to go into. Well, okay, I will. Sarandon and Deneuve have become lovers and the shivering, sweating Sarandon must suck her boyfriend's innocent blood to restore her well being. But then why does Sarandon then plunge a tiny blade into Deneuve's carotid artery? Or was it the other way around -- the scene is so clumsily edited that either event fits into the scene. This may be a cult film, but it's not a cult that I belong to. The plot is a reckless jumble of expediencies. I wouldn't watch it again, although I wouldn't mind saving the soft-core encounter between Deneuve and Sarandon on some other tape. Those softly billowing see-through curtains over their entwined bodies are very exciting, although I missed the jasmine-scented candles. Go ahead and watch, if you like. De gustibus non disputandum est. It's very stylishly done. Deneuve is languid, flawless in her icy beauty and there is a great seduction scene when she sits in the darkened room playing the Flower Duet from Lakme on the piano and describes it to Sarandon as a song of two Indian women thrilling over the beauty of a lake, marveling over its birds and flowers. Sarandon remarks, ""It sounds like a love song to me,"" and she's right, and she goes on to ask, ""Are you making a pass at me?"" Without turning away from the piano, Deneuve says, ""If I am, I am not aware of it."" I say, Ha Ha. By the way, their love making is very tender. Women know how to treat one another. But I'm surprised neither objects when the other bites hard enough to draw a couple of mouthfuls of blood from that oft-used injection site on the inside of the elbow. But, again, there is no disputing taste.",The Hunger

9,BA_Harrison,I've no appetite for this.,1,15 April 2017,"The Hunger starts off as a bad '80s music video for post-punk band Bauhaus, who perform their song Bela Lugosi's Dead in a nightclub amidst lots of blue light and smoke, after which director Tony Scott settles for a soporific avant garde/art-house style to tell his dreary story of a vampire, Miriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve), whose lovers eventually succumb to rapid ageing and death, despite her promise of eternal youth. David Bowie plays John, the latest of Miriam's partners to grow old and die before her eyes, and Susan Sarandon is doctor Sarah Roberts, who finds herself with a hunger for blood after a lesbian fling with the vampire.Repetitive intercutting of scenes, lots of billowing curtains, people smoking cigarettes, more fluttering pigeons/doves than a John Woo film, and classical music: chic and stylish is what Scott is clearly aiming for; boring and pretentious is what he delivers.A pitiful 1/10, despite Deneuve and Sarandon's sexy scene, and some excellent old-age make-up by industry legend Dick Smith.",The Hunger
10,moonspinner55,Not an original idea in its head...,4,7 September 2005,"Haughty, psychic vampire Catherine Denueve seduces doctor Susan Sarandon, mixing together their blood to give them both eternal life. Vampires and lesbianism go way back in the movies--it wasn't an original idea in 1983 (despite the 'controversy') and neither was the Playboy layout-type sex scene between the two actresses. However, it was surprising enough to the uninitiated to warrant whatever interest this film had (though it failed at the box office). Lots of seductive ambiance, swirling-until-your-dizzy camera work, imposing classical music on the soundtrack--but still nothing new, no matter how fancy the dressing. Deneuve is predictably ornate and ice-goddessy, Sarandon flashes a hint of her feisty personality, yet David Bowie (as Deneuve's former lover, who ages and withers away) is really the only cast-member ideally suited to this glossy Goth job. Overwrought and unintentionally funny, ""The Hunger"" is as slick as a magazine spread and just as forgettable. *1/2 from ****",The Hunger
11,michaelRokeefe,Sophisticated horror.,3,1 June 2002,"Tony Scott directs this meeting between 1980's goth and the sophistication of contemporary New York City. A beautiful vampiress(Catherine Deneuve) tries to find new life sustaining blood for her dying vampire(David Bowie)lover. Susan Sarandon plays a scientist trying to understand the process of aging. While trying to aid the dying vampire, the scientist becomes the object of the vampire lady's affection. This is more of a vampire drama instead of horror. I think the combination of vampire and lesbian aspects may be a little too sophisticated for the kiddie set. In support are Cliff De Young, Dan Hedaya and Beth Ehlers. Somewhere there is romance in this dark story.",The Hunger
12,Scarecrow-88,The Hunger,3,9 August 2007,"If not for David Bowie's short but strong performance, some good aging make-up effects, three beautiful leads the camera adores, and a token lesbian sequence between major actresses you'd normally not see partaking in this sort of thing(Scott's lone accomplishment in this film, because it's sure not the terrible editing job) this hunk of smutty bile, director Scott would hope you'd find a stylish vampire tale, would be less of a discussed cult item. Scott tries to pass this thing off as an erotic European type of vampire horror cinema, but all the doves, windy see-through flowing curtains, and blood trickling in specific arty shapes down skin, can not salvage no content in story or plot. A terrible film.Oh, the synopsis, or lack there of..a vampire femme,Miriam(the lovely Catherine Deneuve who brings little depth to this character..perhaps the script provided little chance to do so) from Egypt with her pendant always hanging from the neck, watches as her chosen lover John(David Bowie)is beginning to rapidly age with no stop in sight. She wishes to put him away up stairs in a casket letting him realize that the whole ""you'll live forever"" has it's disadvantages. We also see that other caskets join him as she fondly speaks to each love personally. Her next conquest id Dr. Sarah Roberts(Susan Sarandon)whose field of study is immortality..or slowing the aging process down using primates dying of a rare aging disease as guinea pigs. The film shows how Sarah succumbs to Miriam's cold advances(one of many failures..this supposed bond comes off unsuccessfully because Scott doesn't allow the plot to grow;they meet and have sex without much room for small-talk)and faces ""the hunger""..that yearning for blood that drives the vampire. Cliff De Young portrays Sarandon's lover and colleague at the government funded institute they work.",The Hunger
13,Hey_Sweden,"A sexy, slick shocker.",7,29 March 2012,"One will note that ""The Hunger"" is not the typical vampire story. In fact, the word ""vampire"" is never uttered in this adaptation of the Whitley Strieber novel. These vampires don't possess fangs, nor does sunlight harm them. They're still predatory, yet refined and well dressed in the classic tradition. Their main concern is the ageing process, which in the male's case is greatly accelerated. French icon Catherine Deneuve and singer David Bowie play this fiendish couple to great effect, in this movie that marks the theatrical directing debut for Tony Scott, who of course went on to great fame directing things like ""Top Gun"" and ""True Romance"". Bowie's efforts to deal with his ageing problem lead him to researcher Susan Sarandon, whom Deneuve sees as an excellent candidate to replace Bowie. Horror elements are only stressed in bits and pieces until the end. For most of the running time, ""The Hunger"" is really more of a combination of art and exploitation, stylishly made, with striking lighting schemes by Stephen Goldblatt and production design by Brian Morris. In fact, it very much has a music video sense about it, and begins, appropriately enough, with musical group Bauhaus performing their popular song ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"". Palpable atmosphere and mood also add to the effectiveness of this admittedly leisurely paced movie, which is extremely sensual, and gets a lot of mileage out of Deneuve's alluring quality and her coupling with Sarandon. The makeup effects, the work of Carl Fullerton and the legendary Dick Smith, are impressive, with the distraught Bowie (who delivers a standout performance) seen to age before our eyes. Doses of gore here and there add to the visual power of the movie, which combines picture and soundtrack quite nicely throughout. For the first several minutes of the movie, the story is told more in images than words. In addition to our three leads, the acting is sound from supporting actors Beth Ehlers, Cliff DeYoung, and Dan Hedaya, with people like Ann Magnuson, Bessie Love, John Pankow, Willem Dafoe, and Sophie Ward in noteworthy bits. The whole thing is decidedly grim and is played with a noticeable lack of humour, which may put some viewers off, but intrigue others. In any event, this isn't a bad movie at all, and it works as an 80's style update of the cycle of erotic vampire films of the 70's. Seven out of 10.",The Hunger
14,preppy-3,Style to burn...but deadly dull,2,14 January 2009,"Miriam (Catherine Deneuve) a vampire and her current partner John (David Bowie) live in Manhattan and exist off the blood of punks (it seems). Then John begins to age rapidly (in what is easily the films best sequence) and seeks help from doctor Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon). It doesn't help and Miriam locks his body away but Sarah comes looking for him and Miriam seduces her.This film is easily one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen (wide screen viewing is a must) with a great soundtrack...but it's deadly dull. It moves at a snails pace and Deneuve (a wonderful actress) gives a rare bad performance. Bowie is fantastic but he disappears early on and Sarandon (who's always good) can't carry this. It was notable at the time of its release for a sex sequence between Sarandon and Deneuve. To be honest the sequence IS beautiful but it's silly and not that explicit at all. Sarandon takes off her top and there's lots of kissing but Deneuve remains fully clothed and nothing even remotely graphic is shown. Aside from the cinematography, music and Sarandon's acting this is a dull pointless vampire movie. It also ends with a scene that was so utterly stupid I groaned aloud. This seems to have faded into oblivion...it will probably stay that way. A 2...and I'm being generous!",The Hunger
15,poolandrews,As beautiful & stylish a horror film as you will ever likely see.,7,23 June 2005,"The Hunger tells the tale of a centuries old Egyptian Vampire named Miriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve) & her lover John (David Bowie) who both seem to enjoy immortality as long as they satisfy their 'hunger' for blood. They live together in present day New York preying on random people who they seduce, kill by slashing their throats with a hidden knife & drink their blood. However their existence is threatened because for some unexplained reason John starts to rapidly age, he seeks the help of Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon) who is conducting research into premature ageing in a New York clinic. Sarah doesn't believe John at first & ignores him, after psychically witnessing his deterioration she is eager to help but John isn't interested anymore after being treated with contempt. John heads back home to Miriam who has seen this before, the attic in their house is full of the coffins of Miriam's past lover's who continually age but never die. John, who now looks like he's about 150 years old, kills a young girl named Alice Cavender (Beth Ehlers) but her blood doesn't make any difference. Miriam sticks John into a coffin & puts him with the rest as her thoughts turn to finding yet another lover. Sarah feels guilty about not believing John & decides to visit, as John is somewhat unavailable being shut in a coffin in the attic, Sarah speaks with Miriam but not for too long as they decide to jump into bed with each other. As they do what two adults usually do together in bed Miriam bites Sarah on the arm turning her into Miriam's next lover. As the days pass Sarah starts to get the 'hunger' that can only be satisfied by one thing, human blood!Directed by Tony Scott I thought that The Hunger was a unique, stylish & daring horror film. The script by James Costigan, Ian Davis & Micheal Thomas based on the novel by Whitley Strieber fore-goes most traditional Vampire folklore, there are no fangs, crucifixes, Vampire hunters, stakes through the heart or bats. The only aspect that defines The Hunger as a film with Vampires is that Miriam & John both drink blood occasionally. The Hunger is as much a romance as horror with the tragic relationship between Miriam & John & Miriam's eventual need for someone else to share the centuries with taking centre stage for most of The Hunger's running time. It's a great story which I found very engrossing, interesting & ultimately it worked for me on an emotional level which many horror films don't even try & attempt. Scott packs The Hunger with clever visual symbolism & directs with great style that encompasses wonderful use of light & colour, fantastic cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt in which not a single part of the frame is wasted & is used to near perfection & please whatever you do make sure you track this down in widescreen as it's the only way to both watch it & do it justice, great selection & use of music which ranges from classical to rock, unusual editing where not a single shot is pointless & which inter-cuts different scenes together to terrific effect & simply gorgeous production design by Brian Morris especially the attic scenes with the flowing white curtains blowing in the wind & white doves flying everywhere. There is a fair amount of nudity in The Hunger & it amazed me that Scott even made the lesbian sex scene between Deneuve & Sarandon seen like art! The special make-up effects credited to Carl Fullerton & Dick Smith are exceptional with David Bowie's transformation into an old man frighteningly realistic, there are also some nasty slashed throats & plenty of spurting blood along with a house full of rotting zombies at the end. The Hunger is technically brilliant throughout, is a pleasure to watch & I don't think you'll be able to find many better looking horror films. The acting is very good & Deneuve is pretty sexy. I think The Hunger is a film that I could probably talk about all day long as there are so many scenes which stand out & the themes it brings up are also worthy of longer discussion but I think it's a film that needs to be seen to be appreciated properly. It is a little slow at times & I definitely don't think it's for everyone, especially those who have a short attention span or those who don't like films that try to be 'different' shall we say. A unique horror film that I really enjoyed but isn't for everyone. The subsequent TV series spin-off ""The Hunger"" (1997 - 2000) has no connection to the film.",The Hunger
16,lastliberal,Skintastic Vampires,6,4 June 2008,"This film is stunning in it's makeup (especially watching David Bowie age!) and costumes, as well as the sound and visual aspects, like the baboons during the opening attack, but it really shines as a skintastic experience.The beauties peeling for the camera are Catherine Deneuve, who made being a victim seem sweet; Ann Magnuson, a goth chick fondled and bit by David Bowie; and Susan Sarandon, who already had an Oscar nomination for Atlantic City.The ending caught me off guard, but after reflection, it made sense and was tragic.Deneuve and Sarandon will ever be etched in my mind together.",The Hunger
17,Uriah43,A Rather Dull and Dreary Vampire Movie,5,3 March 2020,"This film begins with a couple by the names of ""John Blalock"" (David Bowie) and ""Miriam Blalock"" (Catherine Deneuve) going to a nightclub and subsequently picking up another young couple and bringing them back to their spacious house. Once alone with them they both proceed to slice their new companion's throats and feed upon the blood that comes gushing out. Once finished they put the bodies into plastic bags and dispose of them in a makeshift crematorium. Not long after that John begins to notice that something is wrong with him physically and realizes that he is aging at an extremely accelerated rate. Sure enough, he is told by Miriam that he is dying and that there is no cure. Frantic he goes to a nearby research laboratory where he meets a gerontologist named ""Dr. Sarah Roberts"" (Susan Sarandon) who is doing a study on sleep and longevity. Although he tries to explain his physical situation to her, she doesn't his rather outlandish claims and sends him away. Almost immediately upon doing so, however, she realizes that he was telling her the truth so she quickly rushes to his house where she meets someone who fascinates her even more-Miriam. Now rather than reveal any more I will just this was a rather dark vampire movie which moved at an excruciating pace. Admittedly, I liked the performance of David Bowie and thought that Catherine Deneuve certainly lent some elegance and beauty to the screen. Unfortunately, these two qualities weren't quite enough to significantly lift this rather dull and dreary film and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",The Hunger
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Weak entry, could've been better",5,15 May 2015,"After developing a special formula, a scientist is invited by secretive vampires to help them with their plans and when their encounters make others curious, they eventually stumbles across their true and tries to save her before she becomes fully integrated into the society.There wasn't much right to this one. The main part to this one was the lesbian relationship having a lot to it. Besides being exposed to a lot of great nudity, there's also the really great scene it happens in. Taking place behind a big veil, it's a much classier and inevitably more romantic scene than the high-end sleaze it easily could've gone to. The strange part of that veil is that it comes into play on another really great scene, the funeral of the other vampire as the veil obscures it enough to tell what's going on but makes it still really impressive when combined with the unique lighting on display. Also among the best parts of the movie was the vampire's resurrection scene, which here is just really cool-looking. Along with its kills, these are the film's positives as this one had a couple problems to it that really hurt this one. The biggest issue with this is the nearly large portion of the film that doesn't have anything exciting happen. Frankly, nearly all of the beginning of the film is just incredibly dull, with almost nothing happening at all as it's mostly just a series of scenes depicting them doing nothing but talking back and forth over whether or not the drug even works at all or how they're going to get closer to her. This really loses its appeal after the first couple times witnessing these scenes over and over, which pretty much make up all of the first half of the film. The whole of these scenes are just ungodly dull due to the repetition of these scenes and it makes them all quite painful to get through. This is pretty much a slow-paced film to being with, taking a fairly long time doing nothing of real importance since the lethargic pace really takes a long toll. This is mostly prevalent for the film's last half when it deals with the relationship between the two as this is long, drawn-out and quite useless. The last part to lower this is the lack of blood and gore with this one is very dry and doesn't have very much that would give it more of a chance to bring in more since the opportunity is hardly ever there anyway. These here are what lower the film.Rated R: Nudity, Graphic Violence, several sex scenes and Language.",The Hunger
19,Aaron1375,"Starts off rather good, but has real second half issues.",6,10 June 2004,"This one started off good, but as soon as David Bowie exits the movie, it really goes downhill as the next part of the movie seems rather rushed and underdeveloped.  The story is about a vampire lady and her various loves.  I guess that is what it is about because the movie as a whole doesn't really explain things very well.  Stuff happens and you are left wondering just what happened.  I think though that has more to do with the fact I watched the movie on regular television so it was a bit cut up to shreds.  The movie starts with a rather somber and sad little tale with the vampire girl and her lover played very well by Bowie luring a couple to their home.  They don't kill how regular vampires kill.  As the story moves forward, Bowie's character seems to be aging rather rapidly...his time is apparently nearly up.  Unfortunately, he is not allowed to die, but rather face an eternity of rotting in the vampire gal's collection of lovers.  Though she does seemingly care for each and every one of them.  Then the story races to the finish as the vampire girl really moves fast to fill the void...to fast as this is where the story feels really rushed.  At one point Susan Surandon's character does something with a cross either stabbing herself or the vampire...I couldn't tell.  Then the movie franticly races to a bizarre zombie like scene and then the end which sort of makes sense.  If only it could have ended after Bowie left the picture.",The Hunger
20,zetes,Should have been better,7,25 April 2010,"Artful/arty vampire flick from MTV stylist Tony Scott. I actually quite loved the photography and art direction for much of the film. And I loved the story in general - Catherine Deneuve plays an ancient Egyptian vampire-like creature who grants immortality and eternal youth to those she loves. Unfortunately for David Bowie, she's fallen out of love with him. I'm not a huge fan of Deneuve, but she's quite pretty. David Bowie I am a huge fan of - I actually think he's a fantastic actor, and he's the best part of this film. The second half of the film involves Deneuve falling for a doctor played by Susan Sarandon. Hot, lesbian vampire sex is always welcome, but they couldn't find a hotter chick than Sarandon? Cripes, I dislike her. She was cute in Joe, but she almost immediately became homely. Plus, she's a horrid actress. I have to admit to liking most of the film quite a lot, despite some qualms, but Tony Scott's trademark bad editing eventually spins the movie toward an entirely incoherent climax.

22,christopher-underwood,had fond memories,6,23 October 2008,"I've seen this before both at the cinema on release and some 20 years ago on video and had fond memories of a rather lush and sexy, bloody but beautiful tale of lust in a rather different take on the vampire myth. Unfortunately this viewing proved less impressive. Bowie is still good for the rather short screen time, Sarandon effective and Catherine Deneuve as icily convincing as ever but it does all look rather over glossy and so slow. If I was being generous I could say languid but no this is distinctly slow in parts and no amount of wind rustled curtains or flapping doves can make up for that. Basically this is stuck in the eighties and now looks like one of those over long television commercials for cars or perfume. So eighties is it that I guess it is interesting for that reason but it is a shame I can no longer see it as favourably as I once did.",The Hunger

24,JamesHitchcock,I am the Very Model of a Modern Yuppie Vampire,4,22 February 2004,"Possible SpoilersJohn and Miriam Blaylock are a wealthy young New York vampire couple. Yes, I know that vampires are more traditionally associated with Eastern Europe, but this is the early eighties, the yuppie years of the Reagan-Thatcher era, when even the undead have abandoned their crumbling old Transylvanian castles and joined the beautiful people in their Manhattan penthouses. Here John and Miriam can enjoy all the benefits of the yuppie vampire lifestyle- a beautiful apartment, exquisite furniture, passionate lovemaking, performing classical music with their teenage friend Alice and the seeming ability to murder disco goers to drink their blood without ever arousing the suspicion of the police.Did I say John and Miriam were young? I had better qualify that somewhat. John is actually over two hundred years old, and Miriam is even older- in fact, she is immortal and ageless. John, however, is not. He is not a vampire born and bred, but a human being converted to vampirism by Miriam. This causes one problem. Although such converted humans have a lifespan way beyond the normal threescore years and ten, they are not immortal, and after reaching a certain point start to age rapidly, whereupon they start to decompose into a sort of living corpse. (Miriam keeps all her previous lovers in their coffins in her flat). This starts happening to John in the course of the film, and he doesn't like it. He consults Sarah, a scientist specialising in research into the ageing process, in a vain search for a cure. He kills Alice after learning that Miriam is planning to take her as her next lover (the modern vampire chick swings both ways), although it is not clear why he does so. (Bloodlust? Jealousy? The thought that this is the only way he can save Alice from a fate worse than death? Or (given that the actress who plays Alice was only fifteen at the time) the thought that this is the only way he can save the film from the fate of being condemned as kiddie porn?In the event, Sarah calls at the Blaylock apartment, thinking that John will make an interesting subject for her research, but ends up being seduced by Miriam, who is hoping to convert Sarah to both vampirism and lesbianism. Cue the famous love scene between Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon, followed by an ending that makes very little sense, even by comparison with what has gone before."" 'The Hunger' is a mood, a look, an ambience created by Tony Scott. It is the lighting of Stephen Goldblatt, it is the production design of Brian Morris, it is the clothes created by Milena Canonero"". This quote from the publicity material for the film- taken from `Halliwell's Film Guide'- makes interesting reading and indicates that, although the film may not have many intellectual pretensions, it seems to have aesthetic ones. Those who made it clearly had an ambition for it to become some sort of arthouse classic. The look of the film is certainly unusual. Whereas most vampire films (and horror films in general) have an atmosphere of darkness and gloom, `The Hunger' is frequently light and airy, accompanied by soaring classical music rather than the spooky chords normally associated with films of this type. The lesbian scene is a case in point. This is, in fact, surprisingly tender and erotic, with effective use of background music. Today Delibes's `Flower Duet' from `Lakme' is a familiar piece- possibly over-familiar from its repeated use in TV commercials. In 1983, however, it was still relatively unfamiliar (at least it was to me), and its ethereal, otherworldly quality seemed strangely appropriate in this context.The reviewer who compared this film with `Flashdance', another film from the early eighties, may have had a point, despite the very different subject matter of the two films; both clearly bear the hallmarks of the pop videos of the period. `The Hunger', however, lacks completely the joie de vivre which is the main redeeming feature of the other film. Despite the look of the film, it revels in death and decay in a way that is more reminiscent of the Decadent movement of the 1890s than of anything else from the 1980s. A film can have elegant artistic touches and beautiful music on the soundtrack and still be deeply unpleasant and sadistic as well as deeply silly. `The Hunger' is such a film. It falls a long way short of its ambition to be an arthouse classic; at most, it is a cult movie for those with decadent tastes. 4/10.",The Hunger
25,StevePulaski,"A vampire film not guaranteed to live forever, but one that will not die quickly",6,22 December 2015,"Miriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve) is an immortal vampire, who promises certain humans they will embrace eternal life if they become her lover. We see her current lover is John (David Bowie), a young and attractive cellist. The two comfortably live within their own means, sucking blood from unsuspecting people at the nightclubs they frequently venture and assimilate to New York life quite nicely. Feeding on young souls is what keeps Miriam and John eternally young and attractive, and presumably have an incorruptible youthfulness in terms of appearance and state-of-mind.It isn't until John begins to suffer from chronic insomnia that robs him of his youthful looks and makes him show his age, roughly over two-hundred-years-old, meaning that while he has inherited eternal life, he will never inherit eternal youth. John seeks the help and companionship of Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), a veteran gerontologist (age specialist) who has researched the aging effects in primates for many years. As John tries to decide whether to fight or come to terms with his aging, which has rendered him lethargic and hideous, Sarah tries to find comfort and answers with her sexuality and her own mortality. Her boyfriend Tom (Cliff De Young) notices her spending more time with Miriam, leading him to question her intentions as she becomes dangerously drawn to the lifestyle Miriam lives by.Tony Scott's directorial debut The Hunger is one of the damnedest films I've seen in quite sometime, and certainly one of the more interesting vampire films, and directorial debuts for that matter, I've seen, as well. It's a combination of an exercise in modern Gothic style and the elaboration on vampire life in a way that's serious and believable. The Hunger plays like a devilishly sleek and visual soap opera that never so much as scares, but entrances, as it moves with the grace and elegance of a femme fatale, but hulks and lingers like Nosferatu in terms of the presence it reveals.Simply put, this is an experience more-so than it is a film to find yourself attached to. I found myself rather alienated by the characters in the film, and more concerned with Scott's approach to style and filmmaking craft. The dichotomy of filmmaking brothers Ridley and Tony Scott always fascinates me because where Ridley lacks in craft and detail, Tony always seems to excel, even in his later action pictures like Unstoppable, which have now become grounds for ""vulgar auteurism."" Tony gets the details of The Hunger down to a tee, be them in an aesthetic perspective that allows the bright color of red to pulsate through the screen at various points in the film, or in a narrative perspective, which has Sarandon's Sarah the main subject of serious commentary on sexual awakening, particularly lesbianism and whether or not her story is a parable of coming to terms with one's own sexuality.The Hunger is less a film defined by the strength of its acting, but by the sheer presences and personalities its performers exist as, particularly Catherine Deneuve, who radiates enigma throughout the entire film. A beautiful soul in the film, yet undeniably troubled and weighed down by circumstance, Deneuve's Miriam manages to be one of the film's most fascinating characters, despite most of the crucial events of the film happening to David Bowie's John, largely because of her ominous presence throughout the course of the film.The Hunger's most prominent shortcoming comes in the regard of its editing, which juxtaposes the story of Dr. Roberts with Miriam and John's, causing a rather tumultuous and unpolished editing scheme that has Scott at a quandary in terms of maintaining narrative cohesion. Because of this, Scott can't focus on one particular character or situation and fully develop them, and instead, tries to balance out the playing field by throwing in another story when, in reality, bot need separate developments. It's a classic device many use on their directorial debut to try and prevent monotony and give the audiences a lot to digest, though it backfires here largely because of its strange and carefully plotted story.With that, the aura of The Hunger and the cast itself, are worth the price of admission. This is a vampire film as original and immersive as it is perplexing, and the style of the film mimics that of Gothic/Victorian-era decor without being too overbearing or reliant on setpieces. Scott and company have, in turn, crafted a vampire film not guaranteed to live forever, but one that will not die quickly thanks to all it lays out on the table.Starring: Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie, Susan Sarandon, and Cliff De Young. Directed by: Tony Scott.",The Hunger
26,lasttimeisaw,A false promise of immorality,6,7 November 2015,"The late Tony Scott's theatrical debut feature, a UK production assembles three household names from three different countries, THE HUNGER is a Gothic horror taps into Whitley Strieber's novel about vampirism but only vaguely specifies its origin. It takes place in New York (although the shooting was done almost entirely in London), Miriam and John Blaylock (Deneuve and Bowie) are blood-seeking immortals (the word ""vampire"" has never been disclosed through the entire film), living in a grandiose mansion, but ""immortal"" turns out not to be the case for John, since he is originally human and the eternal life which is bestowed by Miriam has a life expectancy (several hundreds years supposedly), so he seeks help from Doctor Sarah Roberts (Sarandon), whose research team is working on the relation between sleep and ageing, but his doom seems inevitable, and it also directly introduces Miriam a new disciple as John's successor, only this time, a shallowly characterised succession will alter their fate forever.As a first-timer, Scott competently captures the ethos of the time to embellish the vampire subculture with the sonic alternation of synth-pop (Bauhaus' opening performance of BELA LUGOSI'S DEAD) and classic pieces (Schubert's PIANO TRIO NO.2 and Léo Delibes' LAKMÉ: THE FLOWER DUET) to underline the dual facets of vampire's lifestyle: their innate dependence on gore and their noble superiority of eternity; also his visual stratagem is exemplary to cast a sensational vibe during the utterly male-skewing erotic lesbian sex scenes and the pigeons and ghastly cadavers galore finale. But as a whole, the film is wantonly garbled without a through- line to sustain the coherence of the plot (e.g. why Sarah's scientific background doesn't elicit any interest in Miriam's undying mystery? also, what on earth happens to the frenzied monkey which kills its partner and ages drastically?).The icy but ever-so-glamorous Deneuve is stunningly camera-genic, Bowie endures a terrifyingly rapid progeria downturn with the zombie-alike make-up efforts, and Sarandon is so earthly banal compared to the alien but dazzling Deneuve. But none of them can outstrip the ill-defined story. The hunger for eternal youth and the fear of ageing play out as one can expect, but mostly it is an enticing piece of kitsch drawing on blatant erotism and gimcrack horror. Nevertheless it does spawn many tributes for latecomers, off the top of my head, John Woo's trademark fascination of pigeons in the action set pieces and the latest American HORROR STORY: HOTEL, the entrance sequence of Lady Gaga and Matt Bomer is surely an updated representation of Denueve and Bowie here.",The Hunger
27,gridoon,"Too choppy, too arty, but has its moments.",6,11 August 2002,"This is the kind of film that you'll either admire or despise - and you'll know which category you fall into after the opening five minutes or so. Much of it is pretentiously arty and choppy, but there are some effective moments, and a literally awesome, amazing sequence: David Bowie, suffering from a rare disease that makes him age rapidly, waits for doctor Susan Sarandon, expert on such matters, to examine him; she thinks he's a nut and ignores him; and he gets about 30 years older within two hours. Awe-inspiring! However, when Bowie disappears from the action, the movie goes downhill.    (**)",The Hunger

29,tomgillespie2002,"A unique, if flawed, tale of vampire love",6,19 October 2016,"Before he was pumping out heavily stylised action films such as Top Gun (1986), True Romance (1993) and Enemy of the State (1999), the late Tony Scott cut his cinematic teeth on more thoughtful fare such as the slender Loving Memory (1971) and the melancholic The Hunger, the latter a surprisingly sad meditation on love, lust and the destructive nature of age, both mentally and physically. Essentially a vampire movie with little horror, The Hunger is Scott at his most subdued, portraying the tragic end of one long-term companionship and the beginnings of a new one.Miriam (Catherine Deneuve) and John (David Bowie) are vampires living a life of solitude, emerging occasionally to feed and giving weekly violin lessons to a young girl named Alice (Beth Ehlers). When John wakes up one morning with signs of physical decay, he approaches Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), a gerontologist studying rapid ageing in primates in the hope of finding a way to reverse it. Sarah thinks he is a quack and leaves him in the waiting room for much longer than promised, during which John ages decades and flees as his body betrays him. Remorseful, Sarah seeks John out but instead finds Miriam, who instantly strikes up an attraction with the beautiful doctor.Although he was criticised throughout his career for favouring style over substance with sickly action movies like Spy Game (2001) and Domino (2005), this approach works well for The Hunger. There's a distinct coldness to the aesthetic, like death is all over, and despite the film being very much a product of the 80s, it's aged remarkably well. The absorbing visuals do come at the expense of coherency however, and you are left trying to fill in most of the blanks yourself, with many things left unexplained. The lingering question of just why Miriam seems to be the only true immortal and an ending that had me scratching my head left me frustrated. But if you just go with it, The Hunger is at times moving and beautiful, refusing to give in to traditional vampire mythos in favour of telling its own unique, if flawed, tale.",The Hunger
30,jadavix,Dull,4,21 March 2019,"""The Hunger"" is a tedious art/horror movie made by action filmmaker Tony Scott. It is famed only for its lesbian sex scene, which is actually surprisingly tame.Other than that, barely anything happens in the movie. It's more about location shots of billowing curtains and empty rooms, and everything looking drained of colour.There is some story about David Bowie as a man with a disease that makes him age quicker, and a vampire who loves him, and a young female scientist who comes into their lives.None of it is interesting, and nothing held my attention. It felt like a music video. A boring music video.",The Hunger
31,strong-122-478885,"Yo, Derry, Make Mine a Bloody Mary!",4,13 March 2015,"Hey! Like, what in the name of Count Chocula is going on here!?...... Why is it that modern-day movie-vampires are such messy buggers?? They are. When it comes to their favourite drink, Blood-Thick Slurpees, they splatter and spill the stuff around, all over the place, like it was going out of style.Take The Blaylocks (that's the oh-so-refined Bowie/Deneuve vampire team), for example, they get more blood on the walls and on the floor than they ever do in their mouths. I'm not kidding. And half the time they can't even get it into their own mouths at all. Most of it ends up dribbling down their chins and onto the fronts of their very fashionable frocks. (tsk. tsk) I'm tellin' ya - Vogue magazine would never approve of this. Never.The Blaylocks are total mess-cats when it comes to cadaver snacks and full-meal-deals. And not only that, but they are unbelievably reckless and, yes, stupid, too. When these ultra-chic bloodsuckers are finished with their feed for the night they actually haul the torn and chewed up scraps of their dinner down to their cellar and (get this) burn it up in their very own incinerator.I don't know about you, but I'd say that this is none too bright. After all their trendy townhouse is situated right in the centre of a New York City neighbourhood. And unless the locals there have all lost their ability to smell, the stench and smoke caused by the burning of flesh, surely must have 1 or 2 folks around the hood wondering about The Blaylocks' barbecue specials. But the strange thing is, no one ever complains, or anything. I don't get it.In the good, ol' days of movie-vampires (pre-1950's) The Count, Nosferatu and all their assorted cronies always seemed to be so careful whenever they drained a victim of their life-blood. It's true. You rarely ever saw even a trickle of blood run down a vampire's chin or drip from their victim's neck wound. It seemed back in Hollywood's hey-day that these movie-vampires meant business and sucked the body dry. Yeah,'Good To The Last Drop' was their motto, I'm sure. Everything was so clean and easy back then.But these hip-cat movie-vampires of today let the blood fly everywhere, making big, bloody messes from one end of their fashionable condo to the other. What in the world are vampires coming to? And not only that, but Miriam (Mrs. Blaylock) has a neurotic habit of not letting go of her previous lovers. So, whenever she moves from place to place she, literally, lugs around a dozen god-damn coffins that contain the remains of these dried-up deceived ones who she had promised 'forever' to. If a pile of coffins isn't the sort of thing that will draw attention and suspicion to this particular vampire's undead activities, I don't know what will.But Miriam is also big on betrayal and even before her present lover has actually set foot inside his own box she's out shopping for a replacement. She likes to pretend that this isn't so, but she's no fool and, besides, she is utterly repulsed by the touch of old, wrinkled flesh. Who isn't, baby?I have to give Miriam credit for her latest choice for a lover. Sarah (Sarandon) is actually kind of hot, (as opposed to the scrawny Bowie) but on top of that she really seems to have a brain in her head. At present Sarah's working at a clinic and researching the connection between sleep and ageing. This could well prove to be worthwhile research. And I suspect this is one of the reasons why Miriam chose Sarah. Miriam, I'm sure, has very strong desires to slow down her own ageing even more. And maybe Sarah's knowledge is the key to an answer.But as vampire-lovers these two high-fashion females are doomed. Domination is their downfall. One must rule. One must die. Who that is to be all comes down to the one with the more cunning mind. Who that turns out to be will certainly be of no surprise to anyone, I'm sure.Anyways - From a visual point of view 'The Hunger' is a very impressive film to look at and admire. Lots of moody lighting and stylish sets give it an above average look for a mere vampire flick. Director, Tony Scott (Ridley's brother), does a fine job of setting a even pace in the film's story line. And the gore will satisfy any fan of horror movies, in particular the final confrontation between Miriam and all her long-dead and dehydrated lovers. This girl certainly wasn't idle for a minute. And now the mummified lovers are all coming back to 'thank' her for her loyalty. (Tee-Hee)",The Hunger

The movie perhaps for that reason seems to be made to appeal to both American and European audiences. The tone of visuals are more like artsy European movies, but the plot that aging process is being scientifically investigated is kind of American science fiction-ish touch. The story is about vampirism, so there's erotic touch to the story. But the erotic touch is different from any other types of movie I've seen. It's gorgeous and seductive at the same time.All three leads, Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie, and Susan Sarandon looks fantastic in this movie. I've never seen any of them so beautiful before.

She sets her sights on researcher Susan Sarandon (who wouldn't?!), in the hopes of acquiring another looooooong-term relationship.... The excellent ""Time Out Film Guide"" mentions that this film will best be understood by those who have already read Whitley Strieber's source novel, and I get the feeling that this is true. Much goes unexplained in this film, and the average viewer will surely feel that not all the dots have been connected. The picture is certainly interesting, featuring as it does very unconventional vampires (e.g., they can be seen in mirrors and walk about in daylight), and Bowie is excellent in his too-brief role (the film kind of falls apart figuratively after he does literally), but not enough info was supplied to satisfy this viewer. And the once talk-of-the-town lesbian scene between Sarandon and Deneuve now seems quite tame.

It's also the only horror movie made by Tony Scott (RIP). He later made many action and thriller movies , which is surprising because when you're watching "" The Hunger"" you could think he was born to make horror movies . Sadly , this is his only movie from this genre. "" The Hunger"" is such a relentlessly revisionist vampire film that we never see any fangs, crucifixes or even hear the word vampire mentioned anywhere throughout. The vampirism is implied as being scientific in nature (associated with blood transfusions, a gerontology lab).The most supernatural the film ever gets is the seeming subconscious telepathy that Miriam and Sarah share.David Bowie , Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon make a great trio. The chemistry between them is undeniable. The acting is top notch . You don't see actors trying to be like vampires , you see vampires from flesh and blood. Basically , the whole movie is build upon those 3 actors and without them it would fall apart. You really care what happens to the characters.The movie is visually beautiful . Just like his more famous brother Ridley , Tony has a love of dusky chiaroscuro lighting schemes filtered through hazy smoke-filled rooms, strobe-lit action scenes and the heavily symbolic use of doves. The old-age makeup work by Dick Smith is outstanding.Very rarely you will see such well directed horror movie . More than anything, what the film embodies is a fear of death and aging. The pace is often slow. There are some short , but very intense scary moments. There are also some lovely erotic scenes , but I wouldn't call ""The Hunger"" an erotic thriller . This is horror movie , folks.I don't think that this movie is rather too deep . It is a triumph of look over content. However , it asks some important questions about humanity , love and death. From today's point of view the movie is little outdated and there's more style instead of substance . Despite that it's enjoyable and definitively worth watching . Watch this instead of ""Twilight"".I give it 6/10. Watch out for Willem Defoe (""The Platoon"") in small role of a guy near the phone booth.",The Hunger
42,jp_91,"A masterpiece titled ""The Hunger"".",10,19 November 2021,"""The Hunger"" is the best vampire movie ever, an excellent cover letter from the late British director Tony Scott.

The performances are tremendous, highlighting Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. The makeup effects are perfect. The sound design is spectacular taking the viewer into the story.

43,haildevilman,Vamping it up,7,13 May 2007,"A Gothic 80's film that blends stylish cinema with the (then new) rock video image.It seemed to work well too. Despite it's dated look, it has aged gracefully. A new way to show vampires in a contemporary setting without turning it into a gore film or overdo the erotica. The slightly gritty look helped as well. It did seem like a European film at times too.It's hard to believe Ridley's little bro would go on to action films.The Deneuve-Sarandon lesbian scene gets most of the attention. It was actually done tastefully. Sarandon did edgy stuff in her youth.And David Bowie can act if he gets the right role. This was up his alley.My favorite scene? Seeing Bauhaus do ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" in the club scene. I'm a fan.",The Hunger
44,majikstl,Exotic cuisine,9,19 October 2005,"The essence of a superior horror movie is not merely the act of giving the viewer a good scare; any halfway competent filmmaker can do that. Good and great horror films can do considerably more by manipulating the perception of reality and putting the viewer in an atmosphere that is unsettling, yet pervasive, seductive and spellbinding. From the stagy theatricality of the original Dracula to the hambone flamboyance of Vincent Price in any of his Edgar Allen Poe adaptations, to the juxtaposition of blandness and madness in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, or the mystical ugliness of THE EXORCIST, memorable horror films have a distinct style. This is a look or a mood that lures hapless viewers into little worlds of evil, lulling them into a state of gullibility. This is why Tony Scott's THE HUNGER is so alluring: in the post-Friday THE 13TH era of bogeyman freak shows, Scott created an adult horror film that returned a sophisticated style to the beleaguered genre. Combining the luridness of an MTV rock video with the ultrachic posturing of a cosmetic commercial and the cool, alienated indifference of a European art film, all embellished with flashes violence and simmering erotica, THE HUNGER is a NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD as conceived by a high fashion photographer.While this might not add up to a genuine style as such, the film does achieve a certain bastardized beauty that is fascinating and difficult to forget in its clash of the gorgeous and the garish, the grandiose and the grotesque. The interplay of beauty and ugliness is a central motif that is elegantly personified by Catherine Deneuve as Miriam Blaylock, a modern-day vampire leading a fashionably aloof existence in her palatial East Side Manhattan townhouse. But Miriam's icy, ageless beauty conceals the cruelest of hearts and the emptiest of souls. She has the dubious gift of immortality, an everlasting life and beauty that is dependent on fresh and frequent quantities of human blood. Obviously, it is an existence not readily open to enduring relationships. She can alleviate her solitude, however, by sharing her blood, and thus her immortality, with another. But, as always, there is a catch; in this case, with a Dorian Gray twist: Miriam's chosen lover can share immortality, but the accompanying state of ageless youth is only temporary. Eventually, time and debauchery take their toll, causing rapid and irreversible aging, unrelieved by the certainty of death. In effect, Miriam's lovers become the equivalent of Dorian Gray's portrait, a lasting symbol of her evil and her ability to cheat mortality. The dilemma of John Blaylock (David Bowie), her companion of the last couple of centuries, is that his time has come; he is in a state of chronic decay with no hope of death to relieve the agony of feeling his body erode. In desperation he turns to Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), a scientist studying the effects of aging. John is beyond hope though and soon Miriam stores him away, alive but hardly kicking, in a pine box in the attic, along with a number of other suspiciously similar coffins. She then turns her attentions from the good doctor's research to researching the good doctor herself. The cast is excellent, Deneuve is, as always, breathtakingly beautiful, even when just registering emotional indifference, but her moods shift subtly from cruelty to amused sexuality to despair to smug self-assurance, giving her character surprising depth. Bowie, in a part that is regrettably brief, is cocky and sensual as a young man, but even under layers of make-up during the aging sequence, he displays marvelous sensitivity as panic, anger and despair define his helplessness. The Blaylocks are monsters to be sure, but even so they inspire a certain pity. Roles that could have been played as inhuman predators come off instead as bitterly human. Sarandon, cool and efficient as the archetypal professional woman, vibrates with barely controlled rage at the loss of her precious independence and the mixed feelings of lust and betrayal that she feels toward Miriam. She doesn't play the role traditionally, as a hapless victim. Viewers not predisposed to horror films probably will shrug off THE HUNGER as an empty exercise in stylistics, flashiness as a disguise for bloodlust. But horror cultist and even casual admirers of film horror should find it mesmerizing. And the film has found an added cult following over the years due to both its implicit lesbian subtext and its accompanying explicit lesbian love scene. The nature of the vampire has always been innately erotic and this is one of the few films to bring the homoeroticism to the forefront.",The Hunger
45,TheAll-SeeingI,Darkness and Beauty Immortalized,10,11 November 2019,"""The Hunger"" is a vampire film of deep visual beauty and striking elegance, and features in Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie (and Peter Murphy of Bauhaus) some of the most uniquely wondrous and erotic people the camera has ever set its longing eye upon. Every frame and aesthetic consideration here is deliberate, offering a rich and opulent darkness, and a long-term evocation of its era that eschewed distorted 1980s cheese for a stylized grandeur that endures.This arguably remains the most exquisite and sublime of the many vampire movies, steeped in lust and a deep undercurrent of sadness. In retrospect, it's also one of the more tonally enduring torchbearers of the oft-misinterpreted blooms of '80s gothic romanticism.""The Hunger"" is a seemingly ageless masterpiece. - (Was this review of use to you?

46,ozthegreatat42330,This beautiful film has a built in paradox,8,13 April 2007,"When it was first released it did not do all that well because of what it wasn't. It was too intellectual for horror fans, and had two much horror for intellectuals. ""The Hunger"" as much as the later ""Interview With the Vampire, is an attempt to break out of the ""suck my blood, I vant to bite your neck"" mold. It does it with a highly erotic love triangle and with a lot of eroticism. David Bowie has been kept alive for a long time while serving as the lunch cum lover of the Vampire Miriam ( Catherine Deneuve) But he has just about reached the point where she can not keep him alive any more, so she now seeks a replacement. Enter Susan Sarandon. I enjoyed this film, but was left feeling not quite satisfied at the end. One needs to view it in the context of when it was filmed.",The Hunger
47,jgcorrea,A movable feast of sensual vampires,5,24 November 2019,"Roger Ebert found The Hunger ¨an agonizingly bad vampire movie, circling around an exquisitely effective sex scene.¨ Certainly, in his first feature film, Tony Scott already set his future standards for style over content. (or did perhaps he only need an excuse for getting Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon in bed together?) Style's OK, but plot coherence might help a little. This is just a polished lesbian fantasy posed aggressively as a horror flick, which resulted weird and hardly satisfactory.",The Hunger
48,Aly200,A Decent Vampire Film,7,19 August 2016,"The vampires in this directorial debut by the late Tony Scott are the kind of creatures to fear; relentless, fierce bloodsuckers who won't spare your life if you cross their path. There's a punk vibe to the characters and the environment surrounding them (thanks in no small part to the electronic sound effects used throughout the film).Leading the deadly duo is the lovey French beauty and actress Catherine Deneuve as the seductively manipulative Miriam Blaylock. Deneuve uses silence to her advantage as her character utters little dialogue, instead relying on subtle body language like menacing glares. When Miriam does speak, her voice is laced with silky smoothness thanks heavily to Deneuve's natural French accent. Her behavior is almost callous when she learns how quickly her companion, John Blaylock, is dying; even to refusing to save his life by claiming ""I can't"". However during the film's shocking finale, Miriam's actions from the past do come back to give her retribution for refusing to help all her former lovers.Playing the second female lead is the talented Susan Sarandon as scientist Sarah Roberts. She plays Sarah's naivety well as she is a rational woman, but when confronted with the rapidly dying John Blaylock her logic is soon thrown for a loop when she realizes John's tale of his fate comes true. There is a vulnerability always present in Sarandon throughout the film as her portrayal remains human to her final scene. The chemistry between her and Deneuve is electric as Miriam lures Sarah into her dangerous web.The final member of the triangle though he exits nearly halfway through the film is the charismatic late singer David Bowie as John Blaylock. Bowie makes the most of his limited screen-time in the only way Bowie could. He is silent, brooding, charming, yet lethal. The late singer-actor even learned to play cello for the music scenes and the haunting melody pulls you in and keeps you entranced. The makeup to age Bowie's John is remarkable as the actor is barely recognizable under the layers; even Bowie's trademark British accent is barely recognizable when he speaks an aged vampire (According to Bowie himself, he would go out onto the George Washington Bridge and scream out punk rock songs to make his voice hoarse for his later movie scenes). Sadly John Blaylock was a character who was underused and given little to do before he is quickly gone before the viewer's eyes, but he does leave an impression.The narrative is straightforward, but does little to develop the element of trying to save David Bowie's John Blaylock and seemed to rush forward to the relationship between Catherine Deneuve's Miriam and Susan Sarandon's Sarah. The atmosphere of the film is dark and brooding with a touch of the 1980s punk rock vibe in the background. The score is subtle and consists mostly of classical music (played by actors Catherine Deneuve (on piano) and David Bowie (on cello)) and electronic vibrations tossed in the background throughout the film's run time.This is worth a watch for any vampire movie fan.",The Hunger
49,talisencrw,Impressively beauty and sadness-tinged directorial debut for Tony Scott!,8,31 August 2016,"I have to admit that although I've had the DVD forever, simply based on the laurels of the beauty/acting accomplishments of David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve, and that nothing I had ever watched by Tony Scott, with the exception of 'Crimson Tide', really gripped me as being cinephilically exceptional. And no, this really isn't either. But I threw it on anyway, and especially considering it was Scott's debut, this wasn't so bad as to make Bram Stoker roll over in his grave. In fact, although perhaps a tad on the paper-thin plot side, it was quite enjoyable, an elegant and sad elegy of the pros and cons of immortality. Yes, it was more style than substance, yet that doesn't always have to be a bad thing. Here, at least, it wasn't, and I for one simply adored the ending.",The Hunger

Nonetheless I thought the director pulled it off.The lighting, sets and costumes play a huge part in the development of the eerie atmosphere.The film looks beautiful. Is Deneuve's performance brilliantly enigmatic or is she just bored? We'll give her the benefit of the doubt.Some scenes don't make easy viewing. The scene where John Blaylock(Bowie) kills his young neighbour goes on for long enough to make you feel really uncomfortable, especially when you know she knows something is up.Liked the ending as well, with Sarandon's character having to carry on where Deneuve's left off.One I'd watch again but definitely not to everyone's taste.",The Hunger
51,lthseldy1,Graphic vampire tale well worth seeing (spoilers),9,29 January 2002,"This movie is wierd, but what do you expect with someone as strange as David Bowie playing a vampire.  This movie is about a centuries old woman that lures men as well as women in her life and turns them into vampires such as she is.  There is a twist to this type of vampire tale that shows the lovers of the woman suddenly turn old as soon as they become her victims.  They die and the woman finds someone else to take the place of the old lover. There are awsome graphics in this movie that are intence as well as the acting of Bowie, the woman (forgot her name) and Susan Serandon who has played in a few movies portraying lesbianism.  The ending is well worth watching.  It captures the very meaning of the movie.  One thing that I find different in this movie is the lack of usual vampire movies that have the vampire biteing the neck of thier victims, where in this movie, the vampire uses a necklace in the shape of an Egyptian cross that is used as a dagger.",The Hunger
52,bbhlthph,I had more interest in the ant colony characters in Antz.,2,14 October 2004,"I bought the book of this name many years ago when about to start a long journey. Both my time and the available selection were severely limited so I did not have any great expectations of my choice, although I hoped it would see me through my journey. It only barely did so, I nearly gave up on it several times as all the characters seemed to be lifeless cardboard cutouts in whom I could generate little interest. (For me there was more interest in the ant colony characters from the film ""Antz"".) However Whitley Streiber's theme (brief spoiler), of a young woman, blessed or dammed with immortality, who selects a series of human lovers knowing that they will be her partner for only a short time before they age and are in turn replaced by a later version, seemed both original and potentially interesting. So when I saw a film version of this novel I bought it hoping that competent actors would flesh out the characters from the book and create a much more rewarding work. Unfortunately I was disappointed - the director, Tony Scott, seems to have concentrated on creating an outwardly stylish film with many of the less attractive features of music videos. There are a few quite striking photographic sequences which I enjoyed, and the shots of David Bowie ageing rapidly were reminiscent of a much more significant horror film ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" (1945), but unfortunately Scott showed a complete absence of any ability to create a developing story, and total contempt for any effort to create actable parts. Consequently the film is utterly cold and, in my view, ultimately meaningless. Perhaps the fault lay entirely in the original book but if so he should never have taken on this assignment.""The Hunger"" was one of numerous recent movies to have been promoted as a horror film. Such claims are nonsense - it takes more than gore to create a horror film. To be effective a horror film must show that, however mundane the life we lead, real horrors may be only a short step away. Every director considering making a horror film should put all thoughts of vampires, werewolves, possession and the living dead right out of their mind. They should also purge any intention of thinking up fancy new special effects. Instead they should review some of the classic films of this genre, starting with ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" and perhaps continuing with ""Play Misty for Me"" or ""Brimstone and Treacle"". They should also remember that Hitchcock, the master of suspense, repeatedly showed how both terror and horror can develop naturally from suspense, as for example in ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"" respectively. All in all a rating of 2 out of 10 for this film appears generous.",The Hunger
53,ags123,Smell that tobacco!,2,10 November 2006,"Time may be irrelevant to vampires, who suffer none of its ravages, but it hasn't been kind to this film, which has dated badly and isn't worth two hours of our mortal time. Depending too heavily on style over substance, ""The Hunger"" now looks terribly self-conscious. There's far too much smoking going on, an affectation that's no longer cool (and really wasn't by 1983 either). It's one thing for the vampires to smoke (it won't kill them) but Susan Sarandon and the other doctors should be somewhat more enlightened. You can just smell the stench of tobacco in every scene. Even the prospect of feasting your eyes on Catherine Deneuve for two hours is undermined by the harsh, unflattering photography. The plot is slow going and ultimately unrewarding. On the plus side, the soundtrack is an excellent mixture of classical music and new compositions that set a somber mood. This film may still appeal to certain tastes, others will find it self-indulgent.",The Hunger

It tells its story with images so effectively in the States people condemned it for being too stylish. Critics called it a feature length perfume advertisement. They missed the wonderful narrative dynamics. For a change I thought it was even better than the Whitley Strieber novel it was based on. Those visually stunning images-the monkeys, the aging process-stay permanently in your mind.....and have been aped in many music videos since.

A movie that shows you the depth of emotion that is usually missing in most vampire movies. They often show the blood and gore without the complexities of the vampire psyche. Catherine Deneauve is stunningly beautiful and makes acting look effortless while Bowie is unbelievably suited for his extensive part. He comprises half of the film and boy he does a fine acting job I couldn't believe my eyes. The beginning is so creepy and yet so stylish. This duo is more like goth serial killers then vampires as you see the kills without the feeding. And unlike most vampires they dispose of their victims bodies like mob hit men would. A new age twist on a very old age story. And the music is fantastic and ties in the proceeding scene with the previous scene very smoothly. I could listen to that all day long. And yes I must mention the lesbian love scene is very erotic yet I felt it was tastefully done yet not too exploitative. This movie along with Interview with a Vampire actually makes you feel sorry for vampires the arch-typical bad guys. I wouldn't want to be one after seeing either one of those films despite their obvious benefits-sex, wealth, beauty, and how could you forget-""eternal life"".",The Hunger
56,thedarkhorizon,"Ice-cold, dispassionate - like the heart of a vampire. This is on-screen poetry, masterfully executed.",9,3 June 2021,"A film with lots of style, beautifully shot, almost like a dream. I thought while watching how much this reminds me of BLADE RUNNER, in terms of neo noir, voice and tone... and then I have to find out RIDLEY is his actual brother. There you have it. Tony Scott shows vision, not only in its visual medium but the editing, the music, the production design, the classical costumes and the chance to work with some talent.This is a strange film, as cold and dispassionate as one might imagine a vampire to be. It seems to hold the viewer at arms length, not allowing them to experience the emotions of the characters...but the characters, for the most part, are severely lacking in emotion anyway, so the stark emptiness of the film becomes a brilliant mirror. This film is about atmosphere and mood, eternally quiet boredom and ice-cold hearts that search for love.The choice of soundtrack music is quite adept and urbane although only those very familiar with classical music will appreciate the tie-ins. Production design is given full reign and is faultless - the sets, lighting and costumes work fabulously with the soundtrack and the editing, creating a very recognizable style which is a genuine product of the trend aesthetics of the decade in question. And there's an added bonus of knowing use of music.Deneuve is absolutely ravishing and used to great effect and lovingly photographed. David Bowie does an exceptional turn as her lover. What I admire most is the movie's ability to paint a feeling and mood of their existence outside time, eternally present yet eternally on the fringe, startlingly beautiful yet shrouded, veiled, amorphous and ultimately predatorial.Finally, the thought that Deneuve's past lovers never die but are trapped eternally in a constantly decaying shell is intense.",The Hunger
57,spacemonkey_fg,Stylish and Seductive,9,3 June 2005,"Title: The Hunger (1983) Director: Tony Scott Cast: David Bowie, Susan Sarandon, Catheryn Deneuve Review: This was director Tony Scotts first film. The Hunger was a great first stab at directing and a is a film that showed that Tony had a lot of promise. He went on to direct more commercial films like The Fan, The Last Boyscout, Days of Thunder, Beverly Hills Cop II and Top Gun. Recently he directed the Denzel Washington vehicle Man on Fire. As you can see he couldn't have strayed further from the horror genre. But the one horror film that he did make was excellent and I will go on now explaining why I liked it so much.First off, the story develops around a very old vampire called Myriam Blaylock. Shes lived for thousands of years and from time to time turns whoever she chooses into a vampire. She lives with that person for sometime, but unlike her, they don't last forever. For some reason (unexplained in the film) the people she turns into vampires only live for about 200 years and then they shrivel into a corpse and die. David Bowie is her most recent companion to suffer from the aging curse and he is looking for a way to survive it before he dies.Artsy and Stylistic films are my weakness. I favor style over substance and don't bitch and moan when a film puts its style over its character development or story. I don't think thats the case here though, because even though this films strengths lie in its style its story though simple, is very well developed. Its obvious when you watch this film that Tony is brother to Ridley. In The Hunger you will notice that the film has a noirish style to it, lots of shadows and strobes of light and smoke filled rooms. In terms of look this film looks and feels a heck of a lot like Ridleys Blade Runner. But being heavily influenced by his older brother is understandable here, hey, after all this was Tony Scotts first film.But for a first film, it sure shows a lot of control over the whole artistic aspect of the film. Visuals filled with lots of curtains blowing in the wind, lots of shadowy figures. The use of classical music also fits perfectly with the idea that these old vampires have existed for hundreds of years, and not only that it adds a touch of class to the film. Not to worry though, there's also some cool rockin tunes, hey, the movie opens up in a goth club scene while playing ""Bela Lugosi is Dead"" by Bauhaus. Which reminds me that this movie has the look that certain MTV music videos had in the late eighties and early nineties, this is most evident in the nightclub sequences.The movie breaks away from vampire clichés and goes its own route, there's no sunlight that will kill these vamps, crosses or any other traditional ways of killing a vampire are gone. These guys are simply vampires because they feed on blood and can live forever if they take good care of themselves.Susan Sarandon, David Bowie and Catheryn Deneuve all deliver great performances. Bowie of course is perfect for this role since his enigmatic rock and roll persona from his musical past (and present) add a lot to his vampire character. Susan Sarandon was once young and sexy and she flaunts her physical attributes here in a lesbian love affair that sizzles on the screen.The only negative thing I can think of saying on this one is that there's a lot of plot holes in it. I mean there's this monkey that apparently suffers from vampirism and there's these scientists studying it. Why the hell would a monkey be a vampire? Who knows, its never explained. There's a few other plot holes in the film that are never explained and seem to make no sense, but I wont get into them, I don't want to spoil the ending.In conclusion Id say that this movie is not for everyone since it can get slow at times there's no car explosions or guns being shot every five seconds sorry. But for those few outhere who appreciate films with a strong artistic and visual presence and a love for the bizarre should have a good old time with this one.Rating: 4 1/2 out of 5",The Hunger
58,el7,Horror mood piece.,8,24 September 2021,"The Hunger is based on Whitley Streiber's vampire novel of the same name, but it leaves out significant features of the novel's plot. In this version of the story, the only mention of the fact that Miriam (Catherine Deneuve, who somehow makes a cravenly selfish vampire seem romantically tragic) is not human happens when a colleague of Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon in excellent edgy form) tells her that there's an extra set of red cells in her blood stream battling for dominance. It is, however, never implied that Miriam was ever not human, unlike the novel which explicitly states that. It's also never remotely implied that starting as a human is the reason why her longtime lovers keep suddenly losing their forevers.The movie starts with Miriam's latest beloved, cellist John Blaylock (David Bowie, perfect for his role) making the uncomfortable discovery that he's about to lose his eternal youth. He knows this has happened to at least one of Miriam's previous paramours, because he and Miriam have a conversation about it. It's not revealed whether he knew about the others. One thinks he might have reconsidered forever if he'd known so many previous lovers had the exact same expiration date. Hoping to avoid the fate of the ladylove who preceded him, John visits a gerontologist he saw on a morning talk show. Sarah thinks he's a crank, until she sees his rapid aging for herself. Unfortunately by that time, he's returned to Miriam's clutches. When Sarah tries to seek him out, she finds Miriam instead.I'm not going to rag on how fast these two get together, because a psychic bond between Miriam and her lovers is amply demonstrated through the visuals, and also through the sound design. A lot of reviewers have already spoken highly of the visuals, and they are stunningly gossamer in a very 80s aesthetic, but the sound design deserves its own special nod because it is outstanding. Aside from a well-placed goth rock selection, most of the soundtrack is classical, and beautifully chosen to fit the moods being portrayed. Many of the movie's scenes have overlapping visuals and audio to show the manner in which the characters ruminate, both on events from their distant pasts as well as events which have only just taken place. It can be confusing since the director basically just throws the viewer right into it without cues, but once you're acclimated to it then it becomes very immersive. This is a movie that chooses an emotional narrative path over a linear narrative.In this manner, the movie hints that the lovers are tied to Miriam, who says at one point that they belong to her forever. If the scientist is right about the blood, then she dominates them and eventually overcomes them, then decides to store them in her attic like old wardrobe trunks. The implication, which is a departure from the book, is that when Sarah uses the ankh to try to remove herself from Miriam's forever, then her force of will allows her blood to overcome Miriam's, and whatever magic was imbued in this act may have also contributed to the seismic event which shook the other lovers out of their coffins. There's also the factor that Miriam did not ask Sarah for permission to turn her, as it is both shown and indicated that she did with previous lovers. You have to invite evil in. Sarah didn't invite her, which may have left her with some remaining power of her own. At the end, Miriam is definitely now Sarah's rather than vice versa, and Sarah has the good sense to lock that coffin in a cage.In spite of a story-line that passes like a series of fade outs with few solid resolutions, the movie still works as a meditation on how quickly and powerfully romantic love can cloud the mind, providing the illusion of immortality, until it dies leaving the lover feeling like a hollowed out husk.",The Hunger
59,Jexxon,Does not make you hungry for more,1,22 January 2005,"Not much to say really. Deneuve and Bowie are posh vampires, the latter is dying so they try to get help from scientist Sarandon. At least that's what I think it was about.After a while it gets horribly pretentious, ignoring plot or character development in favour of curtains blowing in the wind accompanied by piano music. At least half of the film appears to have been filmed in slow motion, or maybe it's just that the actors sleepwalk through the length of the film. Those brave enough to sit through the whole thing will be rewarded with an ending that must have been some stock footage from an episode of Tales from the Crypt.Is there any reason to see The Hunger? Perhaps if you're desperate to get some sleep, or if you fancy some brief moments of lesbian vampire action. Other than that, it's pretty pointless. [1/10]",The Hunger
60,pekinman,"Beautiful, elegiac vampire story",8,11 June 2011,"I have admired Tony Scott's The Hunger since the day it was released when many others thought it a pretentious bore, not quite horror, not quite thriller and certainly not kitsch. This film came out of the golden age of London/Hollywood films that began in the 1970s and ended at the end of the 1980s. It was a long run a fine, unusual films coming from a studio system that was just coming out of the long period of 1960s technicolor, star-studded movies that were more often than not fake and boring.The f/x of the day were nothing like the CGI overkill we have to endure now, though The Hunger would have benefited from some computer generated bodily decomposition in the final scenes. People used to the current ultra-realism, that seems to have circled back to the fakeness of the 1960s, will think The Hunger about as believable as an earlier generation found the classic sci-fi flicks from the 1950s to be. But with a little forbearance and tolerance and an open mind and open eyes the viewer will discover a very beautifully filmed, scripted and scored film about vampires which steps out of the usual blood-sucking envelope and tells a sad, tragic story of love betrayed.The betrayer is Miriam Blaylock, played exquisitely by the unbelievably beautiful Catherine Deneuve. She was always a treat to behold in all of her films, notably Indochine, but here she surpasses herself in elegance and bewitching savoir faire. She is partnered by David Bowie, as John her 300 year old boy toy she picked up in the 18th century. John's time has run out, contrary to what Miriam tells her lovers before she changes them into 'eternal' vampires, which is a lie she tells to get the object of her desire and to keep her company on her long lonely voyage through time. Susan Sarandon has also never been filmed to more beautiful effect, and she is a brilliant actress and puts Deneuve slightly in the shade because of the latter's more subtle acting style. Sarandon smacks the screen with those Bette Davis eyes of hers where Deneuve caresses and almost disappears before your eyes in a mist of golden beauty. This is poetic language but The Hunger is a poetic film and, as far as artistic creations on celluloid goes, is one of the most beautiful things to behold I've ever seen.The supporting cast is excellent, everyone acting in natural and understated manner, none of them being clichéd in any way. And there are some interesting cameos from actors who went on to bigger things, in the case of Willem Dafoe who doesn't speak a single line, and Sophie Ward, the exquisite English rose who went on to do fine work mostly in British television. You will also see Ann Magnusson who was an icon of the 1970/80s alternative theater scene.There is not much action which eliminates this from the thriller category I think, and the horror is not so much in scary rotting corpses rising from their coffins to wreck revenge upon their duplicitous lover, Miriam, but in the terrible fate of these poor creatures who are not allowed to die but forced to lie in their coffins, slowly rotting but still living, until, that is, their maker dies.The Hunger, for all its shocking killing, is a classic romantic tragedy, but the lovers are gorgeous bloodsucking vampires. This is a perfect film to watch at home on a rainy autumn afternoon.",The Hunger
61,susansweb,A feature length Obsession commercial,4,14 January 2002,"This movie suffers from trying to cram too much into one movie.  Plot points are introduced and then forgotten (most notably, the monkeys that went haywire, what was the point of that?) and the film's ending is completely baffling.  I guess director Tony Scott was more interested in style over substance.  Many shots of curtains billowing in the wind, birds flying around and reflections, clutter up the film.  My main complaint is the too short scene on Bauhaus performing ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"", I wanted to see more of them.  I guess the only thing to recommend is the love scene between Susan Sarandon and Catherine Deneuve, basically big budget softcore porn with big stars.  I can't imagine that this movie ranks high on either one's personal portfolio.  It's frustrating because if a lot had been stripped out and the film focused on Deneuve's attempts to replace lovers and Sarandon's battle with her vampirism, it could have been a good gothic horror film but instead, we get a commercial.",The Hunger

63,GroovyDoom,"Blindingly Beautiful People Live Forever, Apparently",7,1 August 2000,"ENDING SPOILER""The Hunger"" is a difficult film to categorize. On the one hand, it's great because of the stunning cinematography and the performances by the actors. On the other, there is a noticeable lack of a coherent story here. Unless you have read the novel by Whitley Streiber, you may find it difficult to understand what is going on. Furthermore, the film jettisons the entire concept by tacking on an inexplicable ending that defies the story's own sense of self-contained logic.The plot involves an ageless vampire, currently under the personage of Miriam Blaylock. She is immortal and, out of loneliness and the desire to love, she develops the ability to turn humans into companions that seem to share her immortality. The problem is, eventually their bodies give out after a couple hundred years and they begin to age rapidly. This is the problem with Miriam's current lover, John. Adding to the horror is the fact that although her lovers are emaciated and crumbling, they cannot truly die and are sealed into coffins, forever hungry. Miriam keeps the coffins with her wherever she goes, although the film never really decides why. Is it out of her love for them? Or guilt over what she's done to them? Or is she simply afraid of being found out?The film seems faithful at times, abbreviated at others. In the novel, Miriam was not human, but rather a member of a race of humanoid creatures that Whitley Streiber suggested were the truth behind the vampire legend. Miriam clung desperately to her own life because, although she could live forever, she could also die if she lost a significant amount of blood, and lived her life in fear of dying.In the film, these weighty subjects are glossed over in favor of dreamlike imagery, which is actually a fair trade to certain degree. Catherine Deneuve is certainly a stunningly beautiful woman, and David Bowie is perfect as her currently disintegrating partner. Susan Sarandon gives a typically engaging performance as Sarah, the new object of Miriam's affection.The problem is that the movie doesn't seem to have time to explore the deeper meanings behind the motivation of the characters. Miriam comes off as beautiful but empty because we aren't really given a clue as to what she really is. Whitley Strieber's conception of ""vampirism"" is quite different from the traditional one, yet the movie doesn't define it for the viewer, so there could be some confusion about the contradictions that seem to arise (Why can the vampires come out during the daylight? Why don't they have fangs? Why are Miriam's lovers wasting away when she isn't?). Miriam's past is only vaguely hinted at in fleeting images, most notably her memory of an ages-old lover making a first killing out of an Egyptian slave.However, the film's biggest weakness is not the Playboy-style lesbian scene between Sarandon and Deneuve, but rather the confusing ending. Somehow it appears as if Sarah has usurped Miriam's position as the ""queen"" vampire, which is impossible in the context of the original novel. There was no way Sarah could have become what Miriam was, so the movie seems to be suggesting something else was going on here.On the positive side, there are a number of great actors in this cast, even other than Deneuve, Sarandon, and Bowie. Cliff De Young is good as Sarah's lover, Tom, and there is a memorable performance by Beth Ehler as Alice, a young girl who studies music with Miriam and John. Dan Hedaya is always a pleasure.What Tony Scott sacrifices in plot here, he makes up for in style. The narrative is carried by the visuals of the film as much as the script, and he makes excellent use of the classical music in the soundtrack. Today it is not uncommon for a film to run more than two hours long, and ""The Hunger"" could have been much, much better if Scott had been given full reign to flesh out Whitley Streiber's original concept.",The Hunger
64,TedMichaelMor,Elegant,8,4 July 2010,"The Ivan Davis and James Costigan story does not quite make sense, partly perhaps, because the film does not follow the Whitley Strieber novel. Further, director Tony Scott seems to have a gaudy (adolescent) sense of the story that the plot and characters of themselves do not demand. Still, the film has a certain elegance that engaged me. Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography enhances the pervasive iconography of empty sophistication. The pervading tone is one of sorrow and anxiety covering a violent world masked by music and stylishness but always tedious for the main characters.Tediousness underlies an underlying irony that Catherine Deneuve's Miriam and David Bowie's John are truly living dead, who hide their predations behind a mask of supposedly high culture. A further irony is that Cliff De Young's Tom Haver seems much like them, but Susan Sarandon's Sarah Roberts does not. The plot made it hard for me to understand what happens to Sarah even though I have watched this film many times. This is not Karel Čapek's ""The Makropulos Affair"" but the film ends with a similar vision. Endless life takes many forms of nightmare.The musical score, the David Hamilton style photography, and even campy special effects somehow work. David Bowie felt constrained by the heavy makeup he has to wear but he is quite effective as are all the other players. I find this more than a guilty pleasure exploitation film.",The Hunger
65,matheusmarchetti,"Jean Rollin, for American audiences",10,28 January 2008,"Tony Scott's ""The Hunger"" seems to be the black sheep of 80's vampire films. While more mainstream works such as ""Lost Boys"" and ""Near Dark"" took a grittier, fast paced, and overall more ""fun"" approach at the subject matter, ""The Hunger"" went for something more patient, character driven and throuly more 'arthouse' like. It's style can be easily tracked down in films such as Harry Kumel's ""Daughters of Darkness"" and the works of French filmmaker Jean Rollin, famous for his avant-garde lesbian vampire films such as ""Lips of Blood"" and ""Fascination"". Never mainstream hits, Rollin's work gained a cult appeal as some of the most stylish, unique and haunting horror films of the 70's. While the film is in English and Scott replaces the crumblin chateaus so predominent in Rollin's films for a Gothic Manhattan penthouse, the essence of the former's work is still there, and as result, it was both a critical and commercial failure. Yet those who can appreciate the works of that underrated director, will totally enjoy this real gem of a vampire classic.",The Hunger
66,Criticalstaff,Great if you like female breasts AND rotting corpses,5,23 July 2020,"This movie is typical style over substance.
This was Tony Scott's first movie and in that regard it is amazing. The cinematic and stylistic flair is evident. While watching the movie, you frequently want to stop the movie just because how cool some shots are. I am almost inclined to say that all the shots are gorgeous. If there was ever a movie where every frame is a painting, this would be that movie. A lot of it is the lightning, a hallmark of Tony's and Ridley Scott's films. But there is also shot composition, how the shots are framed, and the set design and the overall luxury of the setting. Visually it is a movie of beautiful people moving gracefully in a gorgeous setting. That is until we are shown a rabid monkey or a decomposing corpse.That brings me to the plot. It starts as a horror story, but it veers into a more straight medical thriller only to end into a more fantasy story. Overall the story is not very clear, or even interesting. You can almost feel that it makes sense in book form, but it fails to translate into a movie. It is not the first movie to do that mistake or the only one, and certainly not the last, but it leaves us with a very slow movie, where things are left unexplained.The mere fact that the characters are vampires for instance is never explicitly stated in the movie. It is also unexplained what they actually are if not vampires. There is a lot of talk of eternal life and of blood, but that is only the surface-level vampire stuff. Evidently it does not matter, but it makes the movie harder to understand. For instance, my understanding of the ending was Catherine Deneuve feeding on other vampires in order to herself retain her youth. Turns out it was not true, but that interpretation is not contradicted by the movie.In a lot of ways you could say that this movie is beautiful but does not make a lot of sense. It would be unfair to say that you could almost watch the movie without the sound and still get the general gist of it, but we are not far from it. There is a decent use of good music in the movie, it's a lot of classical pieces that plays well into building the gothic atmosphere. I was however a bit let down that Bowie himself did not participate musically.On that note, the actors are all excellent and it may be the film's best selling point. But there is not enough Bowie in my opinion. The best scene, next to the ""vampire kiss"" seduction sequence, was when Bowie hilariously grows old in the doctors' waiting room. Even though it was unintentionally funny.At the end of the day, I appreciate the visual mastery on display, but I was pretty bored. In other words it is style over substance.",The Hunger

The best of all, was seeing Gothic rock legends Bauhaus perform in the opening sequence ""Bela Lugosi's Dead""-a very brilliant shot of Peter Murphy himself.

71,kira02bit,"Trite, pretentious ultra-chic mess",2,25 January 2015,"Gorgeous, wealthy vampire Catherine Deneuve takes on lovers throughout the ages with the promise of eternal life, neglecting to tell them that after a few hundred years or so, they will age rapidly and spend eternity old and feeble in coffins. Her latest lover, David Bowie, starts the aging process and seeks help from scientist Susan Sarandon, who is doing advanced research in the field of accelerated aging. Unfortunately, she does not believe his tale until it is too late for him, and she herself ends up being ensnared in Deneuve's web of intrigue.Ridiculous film would be laughable were it not for the fact that it takes itself so seriously, so it ends up merely being dull and pretentious. It was a flop at the time of release, but has developed a cult following. It is difficult to see why. The plot is of almost no consequence here and functions as little more than a shaky framework on which to attach the next sex scene or violent attack. The entire film plays like one over-stretched perfume commercial.Gads of ink were spilled regarding the lesbian sex scene between Deneuve and Sarandon at a time when such things were just not done by name actresses. The scene itself is tastefully handled and a few misguided critics overpraised it, while conveniently overlooking that the film which surrounds it is pure ultra-chic garbage.Director Scott films everything and directs his actors so poorly here that one waits for one of them to face the camera with a perfume bottle and start hawking it. The plot is fairly incoherent, especially as the film proceeds. Bowie manages some decent moments, but he leaves the film entirely too early. Cliff DeYoung is wasted as Sarandon's ill-fated boyfriend. Deneuve and Sarandon are both filmed ravishingly, but this is neither one's best day - Deneuve is particularly dreadful here.If anyone can fathom the motive behind the absurd final moments where an army of Deneuve's decrepit former lovers rise for some reason from their coffins (has she been dragging all these coffins all over the world with her?) and rebel against and attack her, while she shrieks ""I love you. I love you all!"" in a laughable monotone, then you are doing better than I.",The Hunger

They have never forgiven the massive use of video-clips techniques, which the director would have used for many of him. Actually to see, Scott attends studies of visual arts that will lead him to have a very refined aesthetic sense he will carry in his films. Among other things he was driven to film art from his brother Ridley, he wanted to do the painter. The debut of him aroused however interest: Miriam wakes up at midnight, literary inspiration film (The Hunger of Whitley Strieber) that deals with vampires. But the director's approach differs from that kind for the setting, history and epilogue. He clearly he will package the film using the aesthetic language he had refined in advertising and music videos.

73,Oggz,Totally Eighties,9,25 September 2006,"Before embarking onto this one, you must decide whether or not you enjoy films which look like a very extended (and quite expensive) MTV video clip of the early to mid 80's. If you don't, don't bother with this, it'll probably annoy you greatly. If you do, you're in for an indulgent visual ride and great entertainment, because every frame in Tony Scott's cult classic is carefully planned, beautifully orchestrated and wonderfully filmed - from the iconic opening sequence through to the heavily filtered last shot, it's polished until it gleams. Production design is given full reign and is faultless - the sets, lighting and costumes work fabulously with the soundtrack and the editing, creating a very recognisable style which is a genuine product of the trend aesthetics of the decade in question. And there's an added bonus of knowing use of music - this being the film that ""relaunched"" the Delibes' Lakme aria, paving the way for it becoming a monster classipop hit it is today. The film also employs Ravel at his most frozenly emotional,and, to stunning effect, Deneuve at arguably her most frozenly beautiful.

74,nvillesanti,The Hunger for Lust,7,24 April 2008,"Watching ""The Hunger"" is like watching a stylish music video from the 80s. The film has plenty of contrasting and expressionist shots. ""The Hunger"" Tells the Story of John Blaylock (Played by David Bowie) and Miriam Blaylock (Played by Catherine Deneuve), a vampire couple who hunt the blood of the young and reckless every other night. Until one day John stats to feel tired and start aging rapidly. Miriam, on the other hand stays young. John seeks the help of Dr. Sarah Roberts (Played by Susan Sarandon) who is a studding aging disorder on chimpanzees and humans. When John tells Sarah of his rapid aging problem, she doesn't takes him seriously and tells him to wait for her thinking that he will eventually get tire of waiting and leave. When she sees him hours later she is shock when she sees that John has grown older in only a few hours. John returns home and asks Miriam to take his life and set him free. But Miriam refuses and takes the almost rotting body of John, to where she keeps her docent of former lovers from different centuries that she keeps in a living dead state. Sarah, desperate to find out of John, she comes to meet Miriam, and then Miriam seduces Sarah so she can become her new companion. The photography of this film is beautiful but in my opinion, there is too much contrast. The performances of all the actor where really good but the one that stand out the most was the performance of David Bowie. This movie explored the view of the vampire and how they deal with the loneliness of eternal life and how selfish they can be a concept shown in the film ""Interview with the Vampire."" It also explores the sexuality of the Vampires and there lust for companionship. The love scene between Susan and Catherine proved to be both provocative and controversial for its time. Vampires in this movie don't have any transformation like fangs or creatures, but instead they use an Egyptian shaped pendant to cut their victims throats. One thing that I consider disturbing in this movie is the fact that Miriam's lovers never die but stay in a zombie decaying state and she keeps them in coffins in what appears to be a collection of undead companions. This demonstrates the selfishness and cruelty of Miriam by confusing Lust with love. I recommend this film for all the hard core Vampire fans.",The Hunger

79,tintin-23,A Question of Hemoglobin.,6,26 February 2008,"""The Hunger"" is adapted from Whitley Strieber's novel of the same title (Strieber is also the author of ""Wolfen"") by Ivan Davis and Michael Thomas, who wrote the scenario. Following the deconstruction and alteration of the vampire legend with Anne Rice's book, ""Interview with the Vampire"" (1979), and Frank Langella's film, ""Dracula"" (1979), Tony Scott made a definitely ""modern"" film by doing away with all the old clichés and myths attached to the commonly accepted vampire lore. Scott's vampires move about in full daylight, there is no mention of garlic or crucifixes, the vampires have no fangs, and the word ""vampire"" is not even pronounced once in the entire film. Scott proceeds by opposition: the rhythm is at times dry and nervous, and at other times tender and lascivious; the protagonists inhabit an elegant, airy townhouse located in a large metropolis instead of a traditional dark, gloomy castle. Scott prefers the beauty and sophistication of the trio whose elegant garments are in stark contrast to the inherent hideousness and monstrosity of the traditional characters and their tattered, grimy attire. He substitutes a delicate daylight chiaroscuro for the night, and he replaces the traditional funereal music with one of J.S. Bach's graceful Suites, an aria from DeLibe's opera, ""Lakmé,"" trios by Lalo and Schubert, and the unsettling Ravel's ""Le Gibet."" The cinematography by Stephen Goldblatt gives to the image a combination of the gloss of a deluxe art magazine and the sensation of a Gothic novel. The subdued, vaporous blues and greens colors of the interior scenes are awe-inspiring, and Tony's editing is MTV-like. The original music by Michel Rubini and Denny Jaeger comes and reinforces the morbid, Gothic atmosphere of the film.David Bowie appearance is relatively brief, and it is his charismatic presence rather than his acting which is memorable, although the scene of his rapid aging as he waits for Sarandon's return is unforgettable (and so is his withering, thanks to Dick Smith's make-up wizardry). A seductive, frightening, and thoroughly elegant Catherine Deneuve, ""La Belle Catherine,"" is sublime in one of her most sophisticated roles. Her enigmatic presence dominates the film from its very beginning to its end. Susan Sarandon is remarkable undergoing her incongruous evolution from a dedicated, successful doctor to a somewhat willing participant in her transformation into a blood-lusting vampire.Of course, ""The Hunger"" became notorious for its Sapphic erotic scene between these two famous actresses. The scene is tactfully rendered, although still rather shocking to American audiences at the time. The seduction of Sarah proceeds with Miriam injecting her with some of her genetic material through a tender bite in the hollow of Sarah's arm, to the music of the (too) well-known women's duet from Léo Delibes' ""Lakmé."" While this beautiful music may seem appropriate, I find it a bit too obvious, and somewhat too ""cliché."" But, contrary to the usual seduction of the damsel found in the more classic vampire films, we clearly get the feeling that her seduction is not necessarily against her nature, and that she surrenders willingly to this forbidden love. In ""The Celluloid Closet"" (1995), a documentary film on the homosexuality in the cinema, Susan Sarandon comments on this particular scene, which made Catherine Deneuve somewhat of an lesbian and gay icône (which, it is said, the actress enjoys immensely).The film's ending is a great disappointment. It parts totally from the Strieber novel's ending, which most likely was what Tony Scott intended. The studio, thinking that Strieber's original conclusion would be immoral, imposed instead on the Director an ending where Miriam is actually being ""punished,"" violating in the process all the themes and rules on which the film was based.Although one would not expect in most cases a worthwhile theme(s) to be associated with a vampire film, except with Bram Stocker's original ""Dracula"" (1897), there are several themes in ""The Hunger."" The first theme is that of addiction, in this particular situation, an addiction to blood in exchange not for a high, but for immortality. The second theme is that of the fear of aging and death. This theme is explicitly present in the first half of the film, when John realizes that time is catching up with him at an alarming speed, and he mounts a desperate and vain effort to stop its ravages. It is also implicit in the second half of the film, as Miriam had found ""the solution."" However, this ""solution"" has become the ""raison d'être"" of her apparently endless life, to the exclusion of everything else.""The Hunger"" is a very experimental film and more than twenty years following its first screening, it remains a unique cinematographic experience. I would have given it at least a four-star rating, but for its ending, I give it three stars.",The Hunger

From the beautiful interiors of the house where vampire Miriam (Catherine Deneuve)lives to the sophisticated elegance of the main three characters, this is a feast for the eyes. However, these characters are so uninteresting and only mildly intriguing that their presence becomes tiresome not before long. It begins well. In fact, it begins very well, as Miriam and her lover John (David Bowie, not bad surprisingly)enter a nightclub and seduce some disposable prey to take back to their doom. Everything, from the editing to the superb use of music, shifting from 80's gothic rock to classical, oozes atmosphere and danger. After that though, it gets really, really dull.The problem with The Hunger is that it's too serious. We are supposed to feel for these characters but they are so hollow that its difficult to pick up interest. At its best the film is mysterious and dark, at its worst it is horribly pretentious and dramatically uninvolving. The end is mildly interesting for its sheer weirdness but the horrific pay-off is a cold experience because, like the billowing curtains that block our view of anything in the hilariously exploitative lesbian scene, Tony Scott doesn't let us into this world completely. We are detatched outsiders, and this approach may be fine in his later no-brain pieces of garbage like Top Gun, but not in a film that seems to be feigning an interest in real drama when really it's doing nothing of the sort.

87,tildagravette,Simple and Stylish Vampire Story,9,31 August 2019,"How far would you go to be eternally youthful? If you're Miriam (Catherine Deneuve), you turn men and women into vampires and keep them encased in crypts once they start to deteriorate and look like death. She and her current lover (David Bowie) are looking for a cure to his rapid aging symptoms and they meet a doctor (played by Susan Sarandon) who might just be able to help. But will she be drawn into Miriam's seductive web herself?As directed by Tony Scott, The Hunger is a triumph of style over substance. It mostly feels like a first draft script that has, somehow, been elevated by Scott's inventive staging, gorgeous photography, and the chemistry between the main trio of actors.The Hunger isn't the kind of movie you watch for gripping dialogue or mind bending plot twists. It's a simple story, well told and well shot. Deneuve drenches the screen in her charisma throughout in a role that doesn't require her to say much, so it's an even greater feat that she's able to tell the audience everything they need to know from her body language and facial expressions. Sarandon gets the most full character in the film and she handles it with her typical professionalism even if she seems to be under the spell of a bad haircut. Still, The Hunger is, more or less, Bowie's film for the first 30 minutes or so and he's the one we identify with the most. He's been both blessed and cursed with eternal life, but a failing body. Bowie captures this terror beautifully and his is the character we think most about when the film comes to an end.Even if you're not traditionally a big vampire movie fan, The Hunger might just satisfy your thirst for a well made, intriguing horror film.",The Hunger
88,cecrle,"Boring, dull, repetitive.",3,1 June 2005,"I didn't expect this movie to be a classic or anything, but even so I was let down. Very boring. Tries to be so stylish and dreamy, but just repeats itself ad-nauseum and doesn't even feature anything worth making a movie about. The only things I liked in this film were the very beginning (i love the band Bauhaus, so seeing them featured in the club at the beginning was very cool & sinister/dramatic--too bad that feeling ends so quickly, it had me psyched for a good movie!), and the make-up work done on Bowie to make him appear to age. Also, one of the revelations about Miriam's past lovers is cool. But that's pretty slim pickings for 96 minutes.This movie is slow, boring, dull, not worth watching--unless you really like hearing slow piano music while watching curtains drift in the wind; if that's your type of thing, then you'll love this movie! If you like plot, dialogue, interesting characters, good acting, drama, then look elsewhere!",The Hunger
89,eskdale56,"Artistic, Visually Interesting, But at Points Incomprehensible",5,20 May 2007,"The plot of this movie is somewhat thin throughout, you got a nearly eternal vampire who takes lovers to whom she promises eternal life. Her promise is illusory. Eventually she comes to her own end, although it is not clear exactly why or how. We see the actual ""how"" but it seems a very easy/simple end to a cunning and eternal being. I assume she comes to her end out of the the enmity of the others caused by the promise of eternal life that is not quite what they thought it was. We learn from the story of John of Miriam's past lovers who never actually die, they just aged rapidly and were stored in coffin-like boxes upstairs in Miriam's NYC Townhouse. Suddenly John and the others get out of their boxes and force Miriam over the side of a stairwell, where she falls to her apparent death and rapid transformation to an aged corpse.The movie leaves unexplained how these weak, previously boxed up vampire-lovers suddenly get out of their boxes and unite against Miriam. Also left unexplained: A) Why Miriam loses control over the former lovers, falls and dies at their hands--how can this happen? B) There are all these birds in the top level of this apartment. What do they symbolize? What purpose or role do they play in the movie? Why isn't there bird guano all over the top floor of this house? C) Why and how does Sarah (Susan Sarandon) apparently take Miriam's place after her death? I mean, why was Miriam not replaced by John (David Bowie) or one of the others? D)Why is it that the other aged lovers appear to disintegrate in death before our eyes, but Susan Sarandon shows up in the final scene, apparently the new eternal vampire replacing Miriam. Why does she survive? E) Susan Sarandon apparently commits suicide in Miriam's embrace, however, when David Bowie asks Miriam to kill him, she tells him that it cannot happen, that he's eternal. So there is an apparent inconsistency here. Why can one commit suicide but the other not die? This movie needed a lot more detail filled in to make its end comprehensible to the viewer and it needed some critical details to be consistent.",The Hunger
90,sethaz-759-115335,Pure Art,9,25 October 2019,"In spite of an imperfect and somewhat befuddling plot, the exquisite beauty and unique ethereal style of this film make it memorable and one of my favorites. It has stood up well to the test of 36 years time so far, lending credence to the notion that special effects are not necessary for film excellence. This one achieves it primarily through deft use of suggestion and mood. The three visually stunning leads alone should place it on every film lover's bucket list, and their acting is superb. Much more than an allegorical vampire film, it presents an alternate take on the subject using outstanding cinematography and music. Sprinklings of violence, betrayal and eroticism season an understated presentation, nearly bereft of emotion, which fits the subject nicely. Did I mention Catherine DeNeuve (!). Wow! I recommend watching, then reading the plot synopsis on, then watching again sometime. BTW my all-time favorite vampire film is Francis Ford Coppola's definitive ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".

92,junecatpower,could've been fantastic,7,4 September 2004,"It comes pretty close. The Hunger looks brilliant. From the beautiful interiors of the house where vampire Miriam (Catherine Deneuve)lives to the sophisticatedelegance of the main three characters, this is a feast for the eyes. However, these characters are so uninteresting and only mildly intriguing that theirpresence becomes tiresome not before long. It begins well. In fact, it begins very well, as Miriam and her lover John (David Bowie, not bad surprisingly)enter a nightclub and seduce some disposable prey to take back to their doom.Everything, from the editing to the superb use of music, shifting from 80's Gothic rock to classical, oozes atmosphere and danger. After that though, it gets really, really dull. The problem with The Hunger is that it's too serious. We are supposed to feel for these characters but they are so hollow that its difficult to pick up interest. At its best the film is mysterious and dark, at its worst it is horribly pretentious and dramatically uninvolving. The end is mildly interesting for its sheer weirdness but the horrific pay-off is a cold experience because, like the billowing curtains that block our view of anything in the hilariously exploitative lesbian scene, Tony Scott doesn't let us into this world completely. We are detached outsiders, and this approach may be fine in his later no-brain pieces of garbage like Top Gun, but not in a film that seems to be feigning an interest in real drama when really it's doing nothing of the sort.

93,Showho,Ebert's Review Is Way Off...,9,11 January 2016,"With the passing of the legendary David Bowie, I can't help but ponder this phenomenal foray into 'Vampire eroticism 80's style.' Time has shown 80's films often don't hold up but Tony Scott's atmospheric feast is the exception for sure. Not a weak link in the bunch here as Susan Sarandon, Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie all converge to generate a tremendous amount of heat, and shed copious amounts of blood! Early reaction to this film was quite awful (ironically.) Only time, distance and revisiting a film many years later can determine how it will truly age. Am aghast at Roger Ebert's scathingly mean spirited review of this film, clearly he was satiating excesses of his own to really enjoy it. If you've not seen it, hunt it down immediately. Its lush, erotic, modern-day-noir feel, exquisite acting and perfect orchestral underscoring will haunt your senses long after viewing.",The Hunger

From there, Bowie and Catherine Denevue soon become involved in Sarandon's life in one way or the other.It's an absorbing horror piece from Tony Scott (his directorial debut).

Seeing that it starred Catherine Deneuve, David Bowie, and Susan Sarandon, I immediately checked it out. Big mistake. This film was a waste of time. I think that the only people who would really be fans of the movie would be those who enjoy the ""shocking"" scenes of lesbian lust. Even though the film is relatively short, it seemed much longer due to some of the extended shots of birds fluttering, fabric blowing, etc. The movie was in no way scary, as a true horror film should be, nor was it enlightening or entertaining in any other way.

Susan Sarandon and Cliff De Young were kind of a surprise.And... sorry, but I hated the movie: oversimplified the (interesting) original story. And way too gory. It also offers heaps of gratuitous pseudo-""sex"" scenes and slow-motion cigarette drags.The film is relatively short (by today standards) but it seemed much longer due to its self-indulgence: not scary, not amusing, non-interesting characters.If only, this film can be watched for the makeup effects of Dick Smith, Carl Fullerton, and Antony Clavet done in Bowie's face. More impressive yet if you remember this was done in '83.Anyhow, my recommendation is: get the book, don't touch this movie.",The Hunger
98,MerryArtist,One of a kind,6,3 July 2007,"Some advice for those who are planning to watch this film: First of all, this is definitely not your regular cup of tea. I don't love this film and I haven't seen many who do. My advice is, don't go and set aside the time for this piece. It's rather interesting to watch once, but if you have better things to do, do them!The movie uses a lot of visual effects and sounds to create a spooky, vampiry atmosphere. While the blue theme and the whole dark setting works quite well and the outcome is quite impressive, some people would say that the method is too slow or frustrating. Just keep in mind that this is a visual film. Don't expect too much dialogue, but remember to listen carefully to the things that are said, especially to Miriam (Deneuve). Otherwise you might miss some points and end up in a confused state.As for the acting, David Bowie is remarkable in his little part, Catherine Deneuve is all class and beauty, and Susan Sarandon has some good scenes. If you're seeking to watch this movie solely because you want to see one of these actors (like I did), you probably won't regret it. But what will get your attention is all the fantasy about how the vampire life works in this story. There are some illogical and not too well thought out theories playing at hand, but when you're watching any fantasy movie, you have to let your imagination take over.Personally, I think this movie is more fantasy and drama than horror or romance. The whole vampire idea will get your attention because of its relatively novel qualities, but the story is also about a vampiress and her tragic love affairs. I suppose the movie doesn't explore too much into this area. It would've been better if they had. For those who're interested, I recommend the book by Whitley Strieber, which does a better job of explaining things.",The Hunger

Ironically, these period items are the very reason why the picture holds up so beautifully till this day. The sketchy story, the mannered (or let's say ""in tune with"") acting, the commercial inspired montage all to the service of a formal extravaganza, yet a controlled one.

Catherine Deneuve always strikes me as a beautiful blank-faced animated dressmaker's dummy, and Susan Sarandon's perky feisty little shtick is wearing very, very thin.But. Vampires. I find them incredibly boring and banal, so really I was just, as I said, watching for Bowie. He looked fantastic, but the part didn't give him a whole lot to do. The shower scene was pleasant enough, and he did have a bit of actual acting to deal with on occasion, but he spent most of the film in old-age makeup, which kind of defeated my purpose.

102,clockworkstu,Complex but Fascinating,8,8 November 2005,"It is difficult to discuss a film like The Hunger without rousing controversy. There is an age old question that surrounds it..Is this an affecting, daring, and beautiful piece of erotic art aimed at people who wish to analyse and critique, questioning it's style, digging deeper to find it's hidden meaning? Or...Is it pretentious drivel, laced with sex and violence purely to get the attention of the mainstream? Leaving logic at the door, how was this piece of rubbish ever allowed to be released? There are, believe it or not, not many people who still remember this film, its opening reception was cool at best, the critics slammed it for being self conscious and arty. But is this necessarily a bad thing? We have been bombarded by art films since film began, so why is this held in such ill-repute? For one, the market it was originally aimed at was wrong, this is not a mainstream film, it's narrative is blurred and questionable, opening it up for interpretation. It's visual style is elegant, beautifully edited, and clearly used as a backbone to the emotional subtext within what appears to be a wholly superficial script. The novel it was based on, by no other than Whitley Streiber (Wolfen), was dense with detail and background story, pushing characterisation. The film version, however, is an intriguing antithesis to this. It is minimal in plot and characterisation, using visual and aural flair to present itself. The past of Deneuve's vampiric goddess is hinted at in arty flashback sequences, but to truly understand this the book is definitely worth reading.All performances are strong, especially considering the material is limited, lifting what could otherwise could have just been an overlong perfume commercial. It is, undoubtedly self-conscious, perhaps even over stylised, but this just adds to its charm and its ethereal beauty.Tony Scott, I feel, is a talent that has been on a downward spiral, turning its attentions to money grabbing action films such as The last Boy Scout. Perhaps if he had been given a chance to mature his style employed in the Hunger, we could have a force in cinema to rival some greats.In short this film will never present any real answers, perhaps it was never meant to. This is a fascinating depiction of loneliness, depravity, and sexual hunger. Just read between the lines and I believe anybody could see this. To present yourself with this film is like walking on thin ice, just remember, life is not always black and white, so therefore, neither is cinema.",The Hunger

I can't really put my finger on why I didn't like it. Well, if you no longer possess an attention span, and have a more Buffy or Lost Boys view of vampires, this movie is not for you.

104,andrecote007,"Dark, stylish and anti conformist.",6,28 October 2006,"Minor spoiler ahead.This movie almost succeeds as a ""realistic"" story about vampire life in the same line as Interview with a Vampire.The simple plot revolves around modern vampires with a disease twist involving a mundane doctor. Except from life expectancy and sensuality (especially women), it does not focus on vampire traits. Which is a good thing as it leaves room for other things. There are no direct references to vampires anyway and vampire enthusiasts will miss the usual coffins, stakes, bats and sunlight of the sort.Characters are not developed enough albeit some backgrounds are being nicely suggested. Bowie's character comes from nowhere. Deneuve's character lacks the experience a vampire of her age should prove. Police work is weak and its lame timing makes it difficult to believe. I guess that more character development would have made the drama even better.The acting from all main actors is decent (even for Bowie) as the characters do not leave much acting liberty. There is even short line from William Dafoe.As for the technique, very dark photography was used with many filters. Also very clean but too often static camera shots. Slow paced, almost esoteric montage with a nice piano soundtrack (using classics like Delibes' Flower Duet Lakme).From the 80's, it ages well but is not a cult movie.

One of those movies was The Hunger, and from the first shot, the very first note of the soundtrack, I was hooked for life. This is an extraordinary film. Some might - and do - accuse director Tony Scott of drifting too far into atmospheric abstractions, and even Scott himself now admits he'd probably do it a little differently if he did it today. But this heavily stylized vampire flick, in which the word vampire is never spoken, deals deftly with the particular difficulties vampires themselves must face in their perpetual quest for life, love and somebody to keep them company ""For ever and ever"". The cast are perfect, especially David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve, who are so good as the sophisticated Blaylocks you can really believe the brownstones of New York City accommodate the wealthy undead. Another, lesser known star of this production is make-up artist Dick Smith, whose old-school effects magic puts contemporary digital technology to shame. The music is marvelous, contrasting the pop culture of the 1980s with the timeless and refined existence of its immortal inhabitants.

The setting for the film was great but I would not recommend the movie, unless you are obsessed with the 80s, Vampires, Lesbian (soft) porn, David Bowie, and/or Susan Sarandon's nipples.Ultimately, I projected meaning onto the film, where there was none. My analysis is that Tony Scott and the actors were subconsciously tackling the issues of HIV/aids and homosexuality.Really though, it's just a stylish 80s vampire film with a horribly weak and confusing ending (someone described the ending as stock footage of the tales from the crypt... totally on point).The first part is interesting but promises more than it delivers, and offers an interesting take on what it means to be a vampire. i was able to look past the big and obvious questions i had, like why are these vampires able to be in sunlight, need to use jewelery to slash necks, and suddenly age to corpse like zombies... i found myself challenging my limiting definition of vampires. kudos for rocking my vampire paradigm. The middle is full of curtain flowing, white pigeon flashing, nipple hard lesbian ""love"" making. I wasn't on the edge of my seat with lust, but some in the crowd were definitely feeling it. I was just kinda bored and thought that it was a little ridiculous. There's a line during this part of the film which really just sums up the whole thing...While the script may have read, ""put your faith in me"" what came out through a thick accent was, ""put your face in me."" and there you have it. the entire crowd cracked up, and at this point i lost all hope of a decent ending...So to the ending... which is absolutely horrible. It was rushed, completely inconsistent with the rest of the film, and very very cheap. There are huge questions left unanswered, not so much in a deep and intellectual way, but in a story telling kinda way.Why do the past lover corpses come back to life, why is the main vampire killed so easily and why does she rapidly age, why does Susan sarandon seem to be alive and the new queen when she committed suicide... major holes.",The Hunger

In particular, the choice of soundtrack music is quite adept and urbane although only those very familiar with classical music will appreciate the tie-ins: Deneuve's playing of Ravel's ""Gibet"" from ""Gaspard de la Nuit"" for piano after John passes and after Sarandon's character makes her first kill...her husband. This piece is Ravel's programmatic interpretation of a French poem which describes a person wearily walking under the intense scorching sun and seeing something in the distance, approaches, only to find a corpse strung up, rotting in the midday sun. Beautiful usage of Schubert's Piano Trio as well as haunting movements of a Schubert piano sonata. Then there is the obvious thematic tie-in with ""Lakmé"" by Délibes. (Lesbian love) And you've got to love the use of the band BAUHAUS in the opening sequence-with the lead singer singing ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" in the suspended cage. Deneuve is absolutely ravishing and used to great effect and lovingly photographed. David Bowie does an exceptional turn as her lover. What I admire most is the movie's ability to paint a feeling and mood of their existence outside time, eternally present yet eternally on the fringe, startlingly beautiful yet shrouded, veiled, amorphous and ultimately predatorial. Finally, the thought that Deneuve's past lovers never die but are trapped eternally in a constantly decaying shell is absolutely frightening. Did I mention that Deneuve is sublimely beautiful?!",The Hunger
116,psychiart,The Hunger...one of the best films ever,10,17 December 2006,"This movie was superbly off-beat. Filming was beautifully done. Acting was incredible! One could pick-up on the character's feelings by expression and with the direction of the camera alone without any words spoken. An out-of-the-ordinary film where the journey of Susan Sarandon's character transforms out of passionate curiosity to a world beyond. Yes, their's is a strange world where the viewer becomes a part of it just by watching. This movie will keep you enthralled. You will be thinking about it for a long time after wards and wishing there was a The Hunger 2. I highly recommend it. Ten Stars or Two thumbs up for this Unique Masterpiece!",The Hunger
117,brobhousebooks,"If you'd read the book beforehand, you'd throw rocks at this movie.",2,28 December 2007,"The only way to do the novel justice is as a miniseries. Whitley Streiber takes us down to depths of existential despair that no other vampire novel has ever realized. And the historical sequences are long and engrossing and give us enormous insight into the character of Miriam, not the flash frames that we get in the movie. Miriam is a character of immense loneliness; she keeps her transformed humans with her as pets, not equal partners. She is not evil, she's just not human. So her moral code is not a human moral code. To us it is monstrous, to her it is supremely right. And her first rule is life no matter what. Loving someone doesn't mean putting them out of their misery. It means locking them in a box for all eternity. THE HUNGER may be the greatest vampire novel ever written. It is certainly one of.",The Hunger
118,smitten29,beautiful from start to finish....,10,28 November 2005,"This movie is near perfect. An extremely wonderful opening courtesy of the amazing Gothfather's- originator's of the genre- BAUHAUS... It just gets better. I have to disagree with the other reviewer, who said that if you didn't read the book, you wouldn't understand what was going on. It's completely untrue. The story is your not so basic ""Vampires in Love"" story. Cast is perfection. Bowie is incredible, Susan Sarandon is wonderful, as is the legendary cool, beautiful Catherine Deneuve. There are NO false notes in the entire movie. Sure, you can get distracted by the sumptuous settings, and the beautiful photography-- though that is the point! It's called THE HUNGER, so you have to be drooling to get into it. Get it??! I am being serious. There are other vampire movies that are as good, but IMHO, not better. Why? Because of the sensuality, which is rarely portrayed as nicely as this, even amongst the despair and the coldness of their 'mission' and the life these characters live. Especially Miriam. After a few views, you may not get over the background, the atmosphere, or what happens to everyone- BUT, you will appreciate it for what it is. A movie WITH substance, and style, and sensuality, and a BRAIN. It lets you think for yourself, and just drink in (pun fully intentional.) the lushness, the bizarreness, the beauty, and the complete decadence of their age--- as in society, and literally, how long they have lived. Just enjoy it. It's a movie, not an art exam! lol.side note: Bauhaus is brilliant. Saw them this month. Incredible. GO SEE THEM!!!",The Hunger
119,OldfatherStudios,"Love isn't forever even for vampires, but a great film is.",10,6 November 2003,"Easily the sexiest vampire film ever and the greatest cast for a modern era vampire film, what sets The Hunger apart even more is the perfect balance of art cinema and storytelling.  Director Tony Scott has yet to match the level of artistry and emotional power that he helped to achieve in this film.  Don't watch this film for the blood and bats, watch it for haunting eroticism and heart-rending romanticism.  The layers of subtext and emotion keep it interesting viewing after viewing, if watching Bowie, Deneuve and Sarandon aren't enough for you (though you may have to be undead yourself for that to be so!).",The Hunger

121,AdamoftheUniverse,"Beautiful, Boring, Original, Provocative, Confusing",6,31 October 2018,"In turns beautiful, boring, original, provocative, and confusing, Tony Scott's (brother of Ridley) neo-Gothic vampire film will likely leave audiences with mixed reactions, though the visual poetry, engaging leads (Bowie, Deneuve, Sarandon), and evocative--though so very 80s-- soundtrack will be enough to satisfy the appetites of some horror fans.",The Hunger

Go watch Queen of the Damned so...How could a guy make a nice film like this and after make a stupid as Top Gun? It seems that was just about the money.Unfortunely, we can't see David Bowie more often in the movies. He does quite a good job here among two great actress like Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon.And so, we got here the efficient soundtrack of Bauhauss, which falls as a glove to the movie. But, who expects a common film about vampires must avoid this one. It's art, not slaughter and spilling bloody.",The Hunger
123,dennissadberry,Deneuve and Bowie should have swapped roles,3,21 October 2021,"This is a self-serving, pretentious, snails' pace of a movie. It falls in love with its own aesthetic, like Narcissus with his own reflection, and ironically squanders the beauty and talent of David Bowie in the process. To make things worse, Catherine Deneuve slept walked through her performance. It would have been an exponentially better movie if Deneuve and Bowie swapped roles. This should have been cut by a third and added as part of a self-serving, pretentious, but at least tight, anthology.",The Hunger
124,apostille,There is no such thing as everlasting love...,8,27 January 2019,"A polarizing movie, as a lot of people hate it and some other absolutely love it. Im in the late category. I first saw a couples of minutes of this movie a long long time ago, in VHS....a terrible medium for this piece of art. As you may imagine, I didnt really like the look of it (on VHS in pan&scan and very grainy) or like the story, so I stop watching it after 10 minutes or so.Few days ago I had the opportunity of watching it again on blu-ray! I felt in love with it. I think the major problem for the 1983 audience is the film is the film is not the typical Hollywood movie of the 80's: its thematic, the melancholia of this movie is much more similar to the 70's era (very similar to Kubrick movies like Barry Lyndon) and some theme are way ahead of its time (lesbianism between two big stars, powerful but realist female characters, etc.).
This movie was made for mature audience, like the horror movie of the past and not a teen audience like the horror movie of the 80's and above. Its maybe why its a difficult movie to categorize. It define the style of the 80's but at the same time its not really a product of its time.
The contrast between the north american 80's and the european classical period is very well done. The young Alice is a very interesting character, as she's a mix of both period, dress and acting like a typical cool kid of the 80's but playing and loving classical music. Deneuve and Bowie are mannered, speak slowly, they feel powerful, immortal. Bowie change his behavior after aging...The other characters are speaking and moving much more quickly, their not only mortal, but also typical of the 80's era: their world is going fast.A lot of people that dont like this movie were expecting a typical horror movie, but its more a fantastic/mysterious/romantic movie à la Picnic at Hanging Rock. Still there is a lot of blood, and one particular murder done by Bowie around the middle of the movie is very horrific, particularly when you understand that he does it more by jealousy than for feeding. Bowie and Deneuve are monster because they think for themselves first. Sarah is the opposite. She wants to help other...at the same time she's somewhat torturing monkeys during her research, a bit like the two vampires feed on humans to survive. The movie is much more clever than the Ebert review let you think. The violence is not gratuitous and film in a way to disturb the audience. You dont enjoy seeing them and the vampire clearly doesn't like doing it. Its a necessity for them, a curse.The story is very simple, very different than the ridiculous horror movie of today, with too many explanations, theories, etc. They don't explain a lot in this movie, but you understand everything. It feels like your watching someone's dream. A few flashback explain very well the relationship of Deneuve with Bowie and the fact she's alive since a few thousands years. The movie is finally a simple but beautiful metaphore on love, that can't last forever. Its a bit nihilistic, especially for a 80's movie.Basically, Deneuve once promised to Bowie that he will live forever and that she'll love him forever and ever, but not that it will be forever young nor that she will have (sexual) passion for him after he gets old. You see that Deneuve is not passionately in love with Bowie anymore, and that she quickly decide to replace him with Sarandon. But still, the movie doesn't paint Deneuve as an egoist monster being, she still care for the persons she once loved. Her sadness is real, she understand she cant desire Bowie passionately as before. The ex-lovers of Deneuve are keep in their coffin, like memories. Same thing happened to Sarandon and his husband. Finally, Deneuve will suffer herself, rejected by the person she love. This situation bring back her ex-lovers to haunt her, like memories again.This movie could be a 10/10...but the ending is dissapointing.It doesn't make much sens and almost contradict the message and the spirit of the movie. Supposedly, the studio imposed the ending to give a somewhat happy ending (typical of the 80's when movie studios became obsessed to appeal to the families first and think that ''art work'' were not appealing to them). The ending is not terrible, but the agony of Deneuve should be link to the fact someone rejected her love, not by a trick by Sarandon to replace her. Sarandon also didn't like the ending and think her character should have die, since she already rejected a life of eternal addiction - and pain). Still, the beautiful music and photography at the end of the movie compensate this disappointing ending.
IMHO is a gem for fan of this kind of movie. Clearly inspired Interview with he vampire and Let the Right One In...",The Hunger
