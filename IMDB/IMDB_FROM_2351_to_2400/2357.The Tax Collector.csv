0,nogodnomasters,I need more carrots,4,30 August 2020,"David (Bobby Soto) inherited the tax collection business from his father. He takes 30% of all drug sales in LA. Creeper (Shia LaBeouf ) is his muscle. A cold-blooded godless killer whom people think he is a Satanist. As it turns out pops killed a man, but not his son who now wants the business and he has the guns.I liked the Creeper character. There was a little too much religious dialogue. What started out good ended up in a shoot out mess, Where was the combat between Creeper and his female counterpart?Guide: F-word. nudity.",The Tax Collector
1,kosmasp,Paid their dues,6,20 August 2021,"I really wanted to like this even more, but it just feels so uneven. There are many things that I do like about this (outside of the over the top performance by Shia that is). But there are also many things that while I understand, they just don't work as well as the movie thinks they do - like the help towards the end of the movie. It is set up in a way during the movie, but it still feels ... detached from it.The movie is quite hellbent on displaying violence. The really gruesome things are mostly not shown up close. There is one scene though that ... well some would say is in your face - pun very much intended.Not sure how much you can connect with the main character (not Shia, he's the sidekick of sorts). Depending on that, will determine how invested you'll be. Not a bad movie by a long shot, just not as mad and good as I expected it to be.",The Tax Collector
2,paul_haakonsen,Slightly more than just another generic gangbanger movie...,5,6 December 2020,"Well, the 2020 movie ""The Tax Collector"" was what it was; essentially just another generic gang-related action crime movie, for better or worse. But there was something oddly entertaining about the movie though.Sure, if you enjoy watching movies with street gangs and criminal activity, then I believe you will find ""The Tax Collector"" rather entertaining. However, this movie had a tendency to feel like just about every other movie based on the same formula.The storyline told in ""The Tax Collector"" was pretty straight forward, although it was fairly generic, and with writer and director David Ayer leaving no room for surprises, the movie felt linear to the point of being overly predictable. There just simply were not surprised throughout the course of the movie.I will say, though, that writer and director David Ayer did manage to concoct a movie where it felt like the audience was right there alongside David (played by Bobby Soto) and Creeper (played by Shia LaBeouf), and that definitely added an enjoyable level to the movie.It was also nice to see the likes of George Lopez, Jimmy Smits and Noel Gugliemi show up in the movie.While ""The Tax Collector"" was entertaining enough and enjoyable enough for what it turned out to be, it was ultimately just another run-of-the-mill-gangbanger-movie, truth be told. But some pretty convincing acting performances managed to bring the movie up a notch. Which reflects in my rating of the movie, which settles on a six out of ten stars.",The Tax Collector
3,cruise01,Gritty Gangster film with a script that lacks emotional depth.,7,6 October 2020,(3.5 out of 5 stars).The Tax Collector is a pretty fair crime drama film about David (Bobby Soto) and Creeper (Shia Labeouf) who are tax collectors that collect money from other gangsters. When they come out short. Everything falls apart when another gang leader shows up. Intimidating and attacking everything they care about.It was a pretty decent plot. Can be a little predictable with the direction it goes. Creeper and David are best friends that would die for each other. Even when things turn for the worse.The film is violent and gritty with its content. Like a brief torture scene. The action sequences was decent.The script is lacking the emotional depth with the characters. Which makes it difficult to care for when lives are at stake. Which the film really needed with the main characters.It was a pretty fair film if you enjoy gangster kind of films.,The Tax Collector
4,Floated2,Average David Ayer film,6,2 October 2020,"Having seen previous films by director David Ayer and knowing his style, went into the tax collector as decent high hopes. This film is quite entertaining but also disappointing. It isn't on the level of his earlier films such as Harsh Times or End of watch. Although found it better than Bright (which found to be lacking of excitement)As many reviews have stated, Shia LaBeouf is the highlight but he isn't the central character, and unfortunately his character dies early one (around the final 30 mins or so). The central character of David is the typical Latino type (family man but a crime lord- found his character to be quite irritating with his constant whining and over the top cursing).The violence is quite brutal and excessive but expected. Some strong scenes but at the same times rather predictable. In the end this film is enjoyable but not great- which it should have been better.",The Tax Collector
5,eddie_baggins,Another David Ayer failure,1,11 November 2020,"Before we go into the hot streaming pile of garbage that is The Tax Collector, I think it's worth remembering that at one time writer/director David Ayer was responsible for the script of gritty cop thriller classic Training Day and also was in charge behind the camera of really quite good thrillers Fury & End of Watch.His also responsible for downright atrocious films Bright and Sabotage but we could previously put them down to bad luck or mismanagement, but now Ayer's lack of ability to craft a coherent or well-put together feature is becoming a major concern.Originally planned for a mid-tier level cinematic release, The Tax Collector comes our way now courtesy of VOD/direct to disc releases and if there was something to be thankful for its that we never had to witness this crime against cinema on the big screen here in Australia as the charisma free Bobby Soto and the extremely method Shia LaBeouf get caught up in a seen a thousand times before story of family loving criminals that find their business mixing with pleasure when a big bad throws his hat in the ring to be the new kingpin.Much publicity was made around LaBeouf's role here as the loose-cannon tattoo clad Creeper but make no mistake, LaBeouf may as well not have shown up (and could've definitely completed this role without adding to his tattoo collection) as Ayer is more focused on exploring the trials of Soto's David who has his money rich world turned upside down by the appearance of Jose Conejo Martin's chicken hating Conejo, a blood-thirsty criminal hellbent on taking over L.A's drug world.It's a constantly nasty and bleak affair, filled with some of Ayer's worst ever dialogue ""I got a .38 on each ankle, .38 on my right, .25 on my left, chopper in the trunk, lockin' my belt, I'm on it!"" is just one such moment that is supposed to get the energy levels up but ends up making you turn your head in concern and the film is filled with a bunch of characters that are neither likable or interesting as Ayer's obsession with the Mexican criminal underworld finally culminating in this atrociously staged outing.The films best chance at being something worth enduring was to be found in LaBeouf's Creeper but he plays a backseat role to proceedings here as we instead get a lot of badly staged family life snippets of David and his offspring/wife that begins to turn into a generic and highly over the top revenge tale that goes too places that make little sense or create little interest as the film falters badly in almost every department.Final Say -A new low for Ayer whose obsession with a particular sub-genre and subject matter has culminated in this humiliating misfire, The Tax Collector is not worthy to be placed alongside its creator's more regarded works and wastes a locked and loaded A-lister on a underutilized character in the process.1/2 a beer cooler out of 5",The Tax Collector
6,damianphelps,Not 1 Goodguy!,7,18 October 2021,Badguys and worserguys.I enjoyed this 'Scarface'type movie with its appropriate violence and action.Needed a bit more from Creeper but aside from that the film offers plenty.Could have been fleshed out for something more significant and intricate but works how it is :),The Tax Collector
7,marmar-69780,The Tax Collector,5,18 August 2020,"The Tax Collector is anew film from David Ayer a guy who give us some great films in past like Fury and End of Watch and one of my favourite films of all time Training day,yes he also made that awful Suicide Squad bet lets not talk about it,let talk about this one,Tax Collector had some good staff in it and it was improvement compared to his last film,Shia was by far the best part of a film ,he was awesome on screen and he had that badass energy around him,it is shame that he didnt get more screentime,his partner in crime wasnt so interesting,his realtionships with his family were rushed and i didnt care for them,Tax Collector was a fine film that could still be a lot better",The Tax Collector
8,imseeg,"Shia only has a tiny, tiny supporting role in this really mediocre and tedious (supposedly) macho gangster movie, which is NOT a tough gangsta flick at all...",3,23 May 2021,"The name of Shia attracted me to this movie. I expected a good gangster movie with great acting by Shia. None of that.The bad: Shia only performs a few minutes in a tiny supporting role. All the other actors are B-level actors, who are so incredibly mediocre and tedious to watch. More bad: this is NOT a tough gangster movie at all, it is merely cliche after cliche, with incredibly cheap and cheesy dialogues and plot turns.Why did Shia participate in this mediocre B-level crap of a movie in a tiny supporting role? That is the only question I have left. This movie is already forgotten within seconds...",The Tax Collector
9,jtindahouse,Some excellent scenes sprinkled around some really poor ones,6,17 August 2020,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that had so much potential, and just consistently squandered it to this degree. 'The Tax Collector' has some truly excellent scenes sprinkled throughout, it's the stuff in between that is bordering on rubbish. So often the film feels like it is about to take flight and kick it up a gear, only to stall for the next 10-15 minutes with inconsequential nonsense. With about another 5-6 rewrites I could imagine this movie being something truly excellent.Shia LaBeouf really impressed me in this movie. He had a great character, who the script didn't let live up to his full potential, however he hit every note perfectly. His accent was convincing, and he was very cool and menacing. The problem the script found was that the more screen time your characters get, the harder it is to keep them cool. The characters are introduced in a very stylish and compelling way, but then as we get to see more and more of them we realise they are just normal guys, and the mystique is lost.All the ingredients were there for this film to work - good characters, played by capable actors, and a story that should have been a lot more compelling than it ultimately was. Basically 'The Tax Collector' has to go down as a missed opportunity. We know what David Ayer is capable of. When he's good, he's amazing. But when he misses, it can be quite a mess (see also 'Suicide Squad'). Unfortunately this was the latter.",The Tax Collector
10,kwenchow,"The worst movie directed by David Ayer I ever watch! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Another big letdown!",1,9 October 2020,"This film start with a man ""David"" wake up with his wife ""Alexis"" on the bed, and their daughter come into their room scene! As turnout, this film is about a tax collector ""David"" need to revenge for the death of his wife and his working partner ""Creeper"", by killing the mastermind ""Conejo""! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the walking scene, and overuse of the staring scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene in the film have blood at certain point but overall quite messy, portray by sideways, with slow motion and shaky! Make the film quite frustrated to watch! Barely intense scene is David fighting with Conejo in the bathroom! At the end, David talking to his father after killing Conejo! That's it! Another disappointed film!",The Tax Collector
11,jimbo-53-186511,So collecting taxes really is as dull as it sounds,2,22 April 2021,"David and his partner Creeper collect taxes on behalf of a crime lord and have a zero tolerance attitude to those who fail to pay up. However, their tax collecting monopoly and the lives of themselves and their families come under threat when an old rival returns to L. A...Perhaps part of the problem I had with this film was in trying to decipher some of the dialogue; the thick Hispanic accents were a little troublesome for me as a Brit to get my head around (although this improved slightly as the film trundled along). Even taking the accents out of the equation, The Tax Collector still isn't much of a film...The plot is paper thin, the characters are cliched and lack depth, the villains are rather feeble lacking any real menace. There is practically nothing in the way of action (until right at the end), there's no suspense and no real sense of purpose about the film. Nothing is really learned about the rival leaving the film with no sense of intrigue or investure. Add to this lackustre direction and unambitious writing and you've got yourself a very weak film.Perhaps the only minor positives with this film are that one or two of the Latina women are pretty hot and Shia LaBeouf's performance isn't too bad (having said that I did find it hard to take him seriously - particularly with his hokey accent and ridiculous cauliflower ears).Truth be told though, I was mostly bored rigid by this film and it's only some of the aforementioned points in the previous paragraph that have prevented me from awarding this film with the minimum score.",The Tax Collector

13,questl-18592,Nobody likes that guy,3,24 January 2021,"That Shia Labeouf guy is fascinating. I actually quite liked him in here and it took me a minute to really even notice it was him. Aside from surprise Labeouf though, there's nothing impressive here. It's just a trashy action flick that wants to be hard but isn't and just feels like it misses on every single weak shot it takes. It wasn't offensive or anything but it was so annoyingly paced and sloppily done that it was hard to care about anything going on. Deaths that were supposed to have weight to them felt like absolutely nothing at all. Such a waste of a solid performance.",The Tax Collector
14,masonsaul,Good crime drama,6,11 November 2020,"The Tax Collector has an extremely familiar and unoriginal plot but is still a good crime drama overall. Bobby Soto is mostly great, if a little wooden at times and he has sufficient chemistry with Shia LaBeouf who is reliably great if a little underutilized. David Ayer's direction is good and reasonably stylish, although it can occasionally look cheap in the more action packed sequences. The soundtrack and the music by Michael Yezerski are both good.",The Tax Collector

16,arungeorge13,..and David Ayer's graph hits rock-bottom! [+32%],3,10 August 2020,"When The Tax Collector starts, it feels as if writer-director David Ayer is headed back to his L.A crime roots.. in the same universe as Training Day, End of Watch, Street Kings, and Harsh Times. But no, it quickly turns into an unbelievably shallow gangster saga with dreadful dialogue, oozing machismo, a generic revenge plot, and stock characters. All the action is reserved for a climactic showdown which, by the time you get there, feels too blah. Out of all the cardboard gangsters we come across, only Shia LaBeouf (in a supporting role) manages to leave a wacky impression. A feral vibe could be felt from the guy.I'm not going to comment on the performances of the rest of the ensemble, or the uninspired soundtrack choices, or the overdose of violence. The Tax Collector feels more like a Michael Bay prototype (if you disregard his zillion explosions) and less like a gritty Ayer attempt. The writing, the cross-cut edits, the underused talent, the much-seen turf-war heroics - it's all just a giant, gory mess with nearly zilch payoff.",The Tax Collector
17,Abdulxoxo,5/10 tops,5,23 August 2020,It was good at first than they rushed through the second half. had the makings and characters to be good but totally rushed the 2nd half.It's Too convoluted both regarding to action set pieces and the plot. Shia and the unexpected dramatic turn from George Lopez were two best things about it. Too bad those were just supporting roles.,The Tax Collector
18,martimusross,"Total Violent Rubbish, Skip This Tripe",3,6 November 2020,"The Tax CollectorGratuitously violent advert for violent criminals, I could see very little redeeming aspects of this movie that portrayed low-life's going about their business of violence, intimidation and coercion.The acting was mumbling method and some of the actors seemed very limited in their craft.A violent turkey 3",The Tax Collector
19,Prashast_Singh,Pretty good if you keep your expectations in check.,10,7 August 2020,"I personally thought The Tax Collector was a solid action movie. No, not really in terms of originality, but the action, performances and an interesting narrative. I must warn you in advance that if you're expecting Shia LaBeouf to completely dominate the movie, you might end up disappointed. He's mostly decent in his role, and so are most of the actors. David Ayer has directed the film pretty well and has kept the story quite simple. There's nothing extraordinary about it, other than it's, in simple words, entertaining. It's not too long either; 90 minutes is a fine duration for a film like this.The Tax Collector starts well and goes on well for the most of the first half. Some might find this slow but these bits are necessary to set the story up. Once the setup is done, it's nonstop action from there to the end. Gunfights are choreographed and shot in a stylish manner, and some raw hand-to-hand fighting is also neatly done. Needless to say, it's the highlight of the film and makes it intriguing. I'm speaking for myself when I say I really liked the film. As for others, I can only suggest viewers to expect less of a character driven film, as it seems to skimp on heavy character development. Nevertheless, it serves a decent and gripping plot as the backdrop for the stylish action sequences.It's not David Ayer's best film by any means, as his other action thrillers had both great action and intriguing stories while this one, on the other hand, just offers good action with some nice acting and a good, not great, plot. But that one issue isn't big enough to stop you from enjoying it if you like action movies. It's enjoyable, and I can't deny that. It really worked for me, and I had a sense of satisfaction when it ended.",The Tax Collector
20,NijazBaBs,unreasonable behavior and too negative,8,3 November 2020,"Almost perfect. Actors look realistic, dangerous, cool, serious, confident. Story is realistic, comparable to real life cartel crimes around Mexico and Columbia. Graphic is good too, meaning much done in form of makeup, movements, gore, effects. But two bad things I did not like is too unresponsive behavior of main actors, where they do not take any action neither when being provoked nor soon after, which is not realistic, and too much negativity in form of gore and anger. I expected more positivity, science, mystery, details, and emotions. Some parts are just skipped and obviously too fake or too quick. Good for those who like to watch cool and dangerous people and crimes, and not sensitive to gore.",The Tax Collector
21,saptesh786,To be copy of Debt collectors.,4,19 August 2020,Apparently it seems the copy of Scot Adkins starrer ' Debt Collector' but fails to copy it and been a average movie. The main hero is looking dumb and its slim voice is not perfect for his role. Once time watchable.,The Tax Collector
22,Sir_AmirSyarif,An awful mess,4,18 March 2021,David Ayer's 'The Tax Collector' never really understands what it wants to be. It contains several interesting elements - mostly things we have seen done numerous times before - but fails to combine them all together in order to make an effective whole. It's also a remarkably boring and uneventful mess that leads absolutely nowhere. Shia Labeouf is the only person in this whole movie who can act. Everyone else's dialogue sounds like they're reading it straight off the script. An awful mess.,The Tax Collector
23,kjproulx,The talent in front of and behind the camera still couldn't save it,4,15 August 2020,"Much like great comedies, gangster movies seem to be very few and far between these days. From cartels to mobs, it really seems like television shows are covering the bases, leaving no room for a great film to break out. Of course, there are tons of movies like this either being made or trying to get off their feet, so that statement might be a little hyperbolic, but it just seems that way lately. The Tax Collector is the latest film from director David Ayer, which surprises me because I've really liked some of his in the past. Even though this definitely has his style written all over it, this film is kind of a mess.The basic premise is that a rival gang shows up to reclaim territory and David's (Bobby Soto) family is placed right in the crosshairs. This film could've easily been a lot simpler and focussed on the revenge aspect of the story, but it decided to play out more like a video game. There were multiple times where I felt like a writer from the Grand Theft Auto video games stepped in and decided to randomly throw in side quests for these characters to go on. This in turn made the movie feel very disjointed. Even though it has a short run time of 95 minutes, it still seems to lose focus on the core premise until the final act truly begins.The anchors of this film are the duo of Bobby Soto and Shia Labeouf.
Labeouf has proven that he's better off investing himself in a meaty role in a smaller project and those films have ended up being some of my favorites from the last few years, so I wasn't surprised to see him deliver a great one yet again. Soto, having appeared in multiple episodes of television shows and a few smaller films, never stood out to me until now. His devoted performance to bouncing back and forth from criminal to family man felt very authentic and I felt for him by the end, even though his actions were atrocious at times. He's definitely an actor I'll be keeping on eye on.David Ayer is a very good director when he is working on the right project. Whether it was his superb effort on Fury or the very well-done End of Watch, it's lower-budget movies like this that get me excited. With that said, the story here deserved much better dialogue and the look of the movie felt too unfinished in my opinion. I get that Ayer was going for a grimy and simple aesthetic, but it felt too plain to me. I was engaged in the story at first, but eventually lost interest and didn't care all that much about who lived and who died in the end, because the screenplay just wasn't strong enough.In the end, The Tax Collector is a film that has some very well-rounded characters in a world of crime that was interesting to explore, but the movie just feels like a series of side plots that eventually leads the core character of David on a plot of revenge. That choice made the movie very disjointed and uninteresting as a whole. Some viewers may enjoy the characters enough to look past these issues, but this film just didn't give me enough substance. A nice effort from all involved, but it wasn't truly worth it by the end. Looking at the talent in front of and behind the camera, I must say that I came out of this film feeling slightly disappointed.",The Tax Collector
24,athies,That is a very dramatic grace...,4,18 October 2020,"I am going to be concerned about that smoke detector until someone puts the battery back.Is Creeper his Christian name?Shia is an excellent actor.

25,Stanlee107,Gangstar paradise,5,17 August 2020,"I found watching this film a bit ""taxing""... This is a modern gangster film that has been made and remade many times. Some are rightly forgotten and there are a few that become classics like Heat, Goodfellas, Godfather, etc... But this is more like Training day in that it is shot as though it happens within 2 days. the director does well to capture this illusion & the 2 antagonists David (Bobby Sato) & Creeper (Shia Labeouf) go out to do their runs/ collections.Everything seems to go like clockwork except a couple of minor issues that they can solve without it resulted in gang warfare. However, with this gangster lifestyle the calm before the storm does not last for ever. A tragedy leads for one of the antagonists to go down a darker path from which he cannot return. The way in which it is done it is unfathomably unbelievable & film logic is implemented in that you know he cannot be killed. The suspense is nullified due to this fact. However, the action scenes are a mixture between of fashion killings and matrix style slowed down bullet time like a John Woo's action film. It is a run of a mill film that won't go down as a classic. It isn't offensive. Just don't go in with high expectation as it probably won't live up to that.",The Tax Collector
26,thekingsdom,"Starts off good, ends up awful",4,10 December 2020,"First moan, I'm soOoooo tired of watching good looking people who can't act. I wish directors would cast people on acting ability and not attractiveness. It's hard to invest in a character when you say to yourself (as I did during this) 'man that was bad acting'. Shia did well, so i can't fault him, but a lot of the super attractive cast weren't great at acting. As a viewer, I don't care if you're hideous looking as long as you can act. Good acting sucks you into the characters and that's what I want, regardless of how you look. Ok, moan over. To the film. I liked the start of this film. It built tension well, was setting up the fight with the bad guy quite well.. and I was ok..let's stay with this..and then suddenly... the last 30% went utter pants. It's like the script woke up, smoked a big fat herbal, scoffed some cornflakes and went..Nah, I'm out of here man. I can't say too much without spoilers, but basically it went 'all family and stuff' and became verrrrrrry cheesy. Hey ho. 4/10",The Tax Collector
27,bgar-80932,Rough,2,18 February 2021,This movie is pretty dang bad. The guy who co-stars with Shia is completely not believable as a gangster. Shia himself isn't very believable.

Maybe next time they won't much such a lazy gangster movie.,The Tax Collector
28,danielmanson,Had potential to be so much better,6,7 May 2021,"I'll be honest I had no expectations going into this film, which may of helped the case a little after reading some reviews on here.I'll start by saying that I don't think it's a bad film, it's definitely watchable and had some good action scenes. But there are some major issues and it stops the film really being as good as it could have been. I'll list below why:The script/plot - it was very jumpy, almost like it was trying to fit in as many scenes as possible, so it felt a little jumbled. Nothing really happens for 2/3rds of the film as well, I feel they could have really fleshed out the film more, added some more action/intense scenes.Character development - leading on from the previous point, there is absolutely no character depth. Which is a shame, because the film is very slow and could have easily used this time to add some depth in there. Shia's character for example plays this unknown enigma. But I don't think this was really intended, it was more poor writing than anything else. Tell me about him, what's his deal? Why should I root for him? It just led to me having no connection to any of the characters.I've given it a 6/10 though, just because even though there is glaring issues I did still enjoy the film and I do feel the idea is there and if it was executed differently people would be raving about it. But you know, it's nothing special but I reckon it's worth a punt if you're sitting there a bit bored.",The Tax Collector
29,danielcereto,Are you serious?,3,8 August 2020,"This movie has potential but everything goes to heck because of the extremely bad script.
First, you need to wait almost 60 minutes of 90 to see something interesting. Second, when the action starts everything goes extremely fast. Shia's character was barely developed. Are you serious?
Last, Fx's look cheap and acting amateurish, except from Shia. But...So, overall a wasted opportunity to create a great movie. Shame on Director 's and writers. Make yourself a favor and watch Sicario 1 and 2 instead watching this one.",The Tax Collector

So many cliches in his movies, tired and worn out story lines. Terrible pacing, lots of pointless scenes in the first 60 minutes, maybe 20 minutes of action and annoying to watch.How can Shia be in the previews as a badass, then says he's killed loads of guys, says he has like 4-5 guns on him at all times and gets kidnapped in a gun fight without pulling a 2nd or 3rd weapon? And he never is seen killing anyone. Hmmmm.Just all around bad. Poor plot, nothing like Training Day just a mess.",The Tax Collector
31,Draysan-Jennings,Total let down,5,8 August 2020,"I liked the Creeper character, but at times Shia trying to sound like a gangster was comedy. I couldn't take him and the other lead serious. Watching two pretty boys collect money from real cholo's looked unrealistic. The movie started to get ridiculous when they go to the club to meet Conejo. Although, it was great to see George Lopez's big ugly head in a cooler, I didn't understand how he got kidnapped right under the tax collector's noses. He was literally sitting at a birthday party surrounded by people in one scene. Then his head in a cooler the next. Anyways, the tax collector's decide to reject Conejo's proposal, which meant going to war. The very next day they go back to the mechanic shop. Why after starting a war would you go back to the one place where you'd be easy to find? leading the movie straight down the toilet. Creeper gets kidnapped and murdered. Creeper did absolutely nothing in this film. They try to make him look like this total badass, then kill him off before we get to see any action. It would of been great to see Creeper and David take revenge in the end. But nope! that doesn't happen. Really disappointing movie and sad story. 5 stars from me.

I wanted this to be a other version of Harsh Times with 2 friends that are Tax Collectors that's what I wanted but I can't believe how in earth David Ayer messed this up badly no wonder this film gets a 4.7 sadly I thought this film would take things simple, and it's film will be how it was like with David Ayer work in his previous films I thought it would be like Training Day or Harsh Times type of genre but in expect those 2 are Hustlers, Hustling people for money to earn it back. he just needs better writing because their are no other writers David Directed and Written this film he needs bit of support to have better writers hire Kurt Wimmer or Max Landis who worked with David Ayer they are writers from Street Kings & Bright because I will be curious to know what other writers would think and how they turn this film differently then to David Ayer idea if you getting my point. . Ayer can't just keep this film very simple why does
it have to be that hard to know how to keep characters alive the ones they don't deserve to die and could made better choices and choose wisely to keep characters alive and write film and fix up
story follows 2 Tax Collectors witch meaning the collect Tax from other Gangs, people anybody that has money that people needs to payback to those 2 Collectors they Hustling everyday to people to earn money that people need to payback from. David (Bobby Soto) and Creeper (Shia LaBeouf) he plays a different type of character he is like gangster scary type of guy that you don't wanna mess with this is something I wish he could of played character like this in another film but in this. David has a family 2 kids and wife Alexis
(Cinthya Carmona) he has Uncle who runs a car wash Uncle Louis (George Lopez) David is a very successful man who is rich guy has family and has a close friend creeper they work their asses off to collect money to start to middle first and second act of film was perfect the cinematography, location feeling type of film where it's filmed at a hoody type of gangster film like with Ayer films is Fantastic, and acting performance is perfect Shia acting was soo great he plays a different type of character with gangster look on him suit, tattoos, he is one hell of creepy guy tape of look that just you don't wanna mess with not because he is called creeper but in another way he is like devil type of character he plays way how he played it was 10 out 10 in Transformers type of role or Holes or any of other movies he play's either prick or nerd that's always like that I like Shia LaBeouf as actor as well I enjoyed some of his films, but him in this film was something a lot more different gangster type of role to it I loved his character. film was great to start to middle 1 and 2 act seeing those 2 guys acting performance out standing that's was worth of acting. then to villains Conejo (Jose Conejo Martin) plays a evil gangster type who uses Black Magic spell he uses. he wants his money to earn back from those Tax Collectors
upends the business from those Tax Collectors Gata (Cheyenne Rae Hernandez)
plays a villain chick witch I liked her role she was an interesting type of character I wanted to see more in film and get to know her more often but it's more on main villain Conejo. when s*it hits fan Uncle was trying to take down Conejo with his men then later you find out his dead with his head in box so then I am like why David could get his family his wife and kids tell them get out of town deal with other gangs or cult whatever they were but no I don't mind car wash action scene it was pretty good action scene worth watching for action keeps your head up then in 3rd act this is where David Ayer F up everything I Don't even know how in earth he is happy with 3rd act of film??eventually suddenly film destroys everything Creeper gets killed off for no reason I don't see why, I don't see why should Alexis should get killed off as well I mean like they could written this film a lot better too me it's either Ayer rushed this film soo much what was he thinking? did he think it was great idea? I don't freaking know how in earth he agree to this direction of film how in earth did he destroy 3rd act of film? Shia and Cinthya Carmona should been kept their characters alive but sadly no because writers wanna screw up and destroy film because they are dry and out of ideas film leaves you dry to 3rd act then David wants revenge because his wife, his uncle, his close friend dies that was Shia LaBeouf I just don't know why should Shia Labeouf character and Cinthya Carmona character alive I don't see them getting killed off in film for no reason wasted Shia Labeouf character I thought he stole movie not Bobby Soto he did fine in film but I thought Shia should have been lead keep his character alive and Cinthya character alive but no writers wanna take it very difficult idea where they are out of ideas. so after David wanted his revenge he hires Bone (Cle Sloan) who is in Blood gang he explains everything what happened he agree to work with David to take down Conejo final action showdown nothing too special then ending wasn't bad ending it was just flat when you see it your gonna say what the heck what else happened?? this could been written better this film is written & Directed by David Ayer he could hired writers he kinda rushed the story and script of film he f up everything in 3rd act of film he could written it better or if he doesn't know what else he can write or if he goes dry hire great, good writers of film they could write this better David Ayer always keeps his films very simple but in some reason he could not keep this film simple I don't know why but in my guessing he was out of ideas that's why he decided to destroy 3rd act of film he could done a lot many things better of this film could been written better 5.10 things I liked about characters, performance, action, cinematography of film, location feel to it but rest of it where it screwed up with a fault ending of film killed it. this is a film I could watch it as time waster not something I would watch it like 50 times in row this film had half of good things then to middle too many missing screws witch it doesn't look too great.",The Tax Collector
33,iamjamalwhite,"they wasted LaBeouf, what a great talent!",6,10 August 2020,"LaBeouf is the reason this movie has anyone watching it and they wasted the great character development with a stupid plot twist. This movie had the potential to be the next John Wick franchise but they wasted it and it fizzled out. Depressing, sad, not a movie I'd recommend. Should have waited to see it on Netflix or Redbox.",The Tax Collector
34,TwistedContent,My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined,4,10 August 2020,"With a true hope for David Ayer making something top notch awesome after his past couple bad boys, ""The Tax Collector"" came as gut-punch disappointment. Though film came out (painfully) average in my book, the disappointment was felt deeply. Nice trailer, right, nice poster, solid director, interesting cast, so what happened?
Nothing much happened, sadly. It is undoubtedly the script dragging ""The Tax Collector"" down the most. Ayer, whose love for the gang and street culture have been prominent in his movies, injected a little too much of said love in ""The Tax Collector"". The film, having a shallow story and all too familiar character doings, relishes gloriously on the spiritual nature of gangsters, boasting morales left and right. Being as openly preaching as it is, some of the dialogue feels very staged. The core plotline moves at a snails pace and ends seriously lacking. Acting performances in ""The Tax Collector"" are decent, though feeling wasted on the background of all the flaws. Shia LaBeouf, who was another pull for me, was given only a supporting character whose role in the story and ending went underwhelmingly. The man got real tattoos for the role of Creeper. I hope the man is rolling with it nicely, for his sake.Cinematography also is not in any real way impressive or quality feeling, but the editing and original score are worse. Very shortly into the movie it's apparent that there's something funky with the editing, weird cuts, weird shot changes, nooks and crannies feeling a little off. It's not constant, but consistent enough. There's quite a lot of cheap dramatism displayed, random slow-mos, befitting and cheesy ""high stakes"" score pieces. The music overall is a lackluster. Honestly, too much about ""The Tax Collector"" simply feels like a TV movie.""The Tax Collector"" hardly even justifies its own name, and is a gang movie that feels itself like a king of the underground, but is in fact a thug for hire. I can hardly recommend it to the audiences its aimed at, because I believe it has a real knack to elicit a pure sensation of disappointment. My rating: 4/10.",The Tax Collector
35,solidabs,Labouf lol,1,23 August 2020,"Jesus.. are you serious? Lebouf was funny as hell. Him trying to be a bad ass was comical. Thank you so much. The rest of this monstrosity was horrible. Oh and the freaking ears. As if to let the fighting public know, yea he's a tough guy. He wrestles. Lmfao just hilarious. Hey the dude who said this is the Cringe collecter,. You nailed it. BOOM.",The Tax Collector
36,Rendanlovell,Here we go again,3,15 August 2020,"I feel so bad for David Ayer at this point. The man went from critical acclaim with End of Watch and Fury (both of which I need to rewatch now) to dud after bomb after Dumpster fire. Suicide Squad remains one of the worst superhero movies of late and Bright is still one of the strangest ""blockbusters"" I've seen. After hearing about Tax Collector I was hopeful that he could get his career back on track.Unfortunately, that is not the case here. Tax Collector, while not the worst thing ever is yet another skid mark on the career of David Ayer. This is just not the right thing to kick your redemption tour off. Not only is this mafia revenge story played out, but it's also completely incompetent in terms of the execution.It's ugly, poorly edited, and the dialogue is consistently terrible. The editing especially is baffling. Jump cuts and the lack of establishing shots make this utterly jarring and hard to follow. This mainly takes place in the first half, seemingly to rush through the set up. Which is disappointing because I enjoyed the set up.I liked watching Shia and the main character, David, attending to their daily tasks. Collecting money, dealing with people doing stupid things, and planning for a family party. It establishes every major player pretty well and you even come to like some of them. The dynamic between David and Creeper was very reminiscent of End of Watch which I liked.The main story mostly revolves around a new player in the mafia game shaking things up. People get killed, chaoes ensues, and David has to take revenge. It's all quite simplistic. If you liked some of the characters more and gave this more time to breathe then maybe it wouldn't feel so bland. I'm sure it was also disheartening to see Nicholas Winding Refn virtually do the same story with To Old to Die Young. (But with exponentially more skill.)It's saddening to see David Ayer tumble further down the proverbial rabbit hole. Any further down and I fear his career may not recover. If you can't make something good out of a Mexican mafia story starring a committed Shia LeBeouf, then maybe you should take time away from the game. Find a story that hasn't been done to death and put all your passion into it. I'm not saying that this isn't a product of passion but it certainly feels as if many corners were cut. The structure is there, the talent is there, but polish was an after thought in every sense.",The Tax Collector
37,Brooklynsmagicmike,The movie isn't without its flaws but overall I found it very enjoyable.,8,28 January 2021,"I was surprised to see that the movie was as heavily panned as it was. While there was quite bit of issues from the fx, cinematography, and under developed script. There was enough action, drama, and emotion to keep you entertained throughout. Bobby Soto I thought was excellent in his role and would love to see him in other films going forward. Overall though don't listen to bad reviews who were critical because its definitely enjoyable movie.",The Tax Collector
38,leesimon-26357,Terrible and borders on racist stereotypes for its characters,1,23 February 2021,"The movie was just stupid. The fighting wasn't worth a view, and there was no other thrills or suspense.

Waste of your time completely. Skip this piece of crap.",The Tax Collector
39,darkreignn,David Ayer has done it again - made another bad film,2,1 February 2021,"I'm not a fan of David Ayer - I don't want to hate on the man, but I haven't really enjoyed most of his movies, except ""Fury."" ""Suicide Squad,"" ""End of Watch,"" ""Sabotage,"" those are all movies that I could not get into. Say what you want about those movies, however, they all had a distinctive visual flair to them that, at the least, did not make them boring, and while I wouldn't call those three movies bad films, I didn't think they were very good.""The Tax Collector"" is a bad film. Gone is the David Ayer visual style, instead replaced by the look of a telenovela. Bland, boring lighting and cinematography plagues this film - everything looks gray, washed out, dull, and cheap, even with the astronomical 30 million dollar budget; I imagine that 29 million of that went to Shia LaBeouf, because I am in utter disbelief that 30 million dollars made a movie that looked as poor as this one does. The action scenes, too, look absolutely horrendous; there is only a single action scene in this movie that looks like David Ayer actually directed it. The rest look like cheap and awful reshoots that David Ayer had no part of. I mean, seriously, midway through the movie there is a shootout and the muzzle flashes coming out of the rifles looks like something someone added through the worst photoshop editor they could find. It is laughably bad, and no one can convince me that it wasn't a reshoot added at the last minute. So yeah, ""The Tax Collector"" looks cheap, but that's the least of this movie's problems.Plot wise, I've never been so bored in a gangster movie before. The shootout I mentioned above is when the movie takes a giant nosedive and spirals down toward its own self-destruction. Admittedly, the first 30 minutes are watchable, if a bit boring. It's character set up at first, and I enjoyed watching the culture of this Latino gang, and especially Shia LaBeouf. I am a huge fan of Shia, and I thought he played a really interesting character here that had a lot of potential - unfortunately, his character leaves the film too soon for one reason or another, and in doing so, the movie's perhaps only saving grace left with it.After 30 minutes, when one of the first, and only, action scenes happen, the movie turns into something else entirely, and I seriously think that someone other than David Ayer called the shots here - it literally feels like two different movies. Plot points are reintroduced and thrown away literally seconds later; for example, at one point two characters are fighting, and one character has flashbacks to his martial arts training in the middle of the fight. Perhaps he will use some of the techniques he learned in order to neutralize his opponent? No. Instead he grabs a broken piece of toilet and hits his enemy over the head. What was the point of the martial arts flashback? Nothing.At another point, you see a character on his laptop, typing very quickly while trading stocks. It's so ridiculous and in a sequence that is supposed to be action-packed that it feels like a parody. Why was this character trading stocks? Most importantly, why was it deemed important to convey this information to the audience and focus on him stock trading? There is no purpose for it, and it serves no purpose in the movie.Additionally, the dialogue in this movie was so bad. Everyone talks in a really exaggerated gang type of way, which may be accurate, but the lingo is so thick that at points I had no idea what characters were talking about. In one scene in the movie, two characters are discussing what to do with a tied up man. One character decides to let the man go, and then he calls a different character over and demands that this new character gets beat up. For what reason? I'm not even sure, because for the entirety of this scene, and for the entire movie, characters talk in a style that only they are familiar with - it's not audience friendly.Is there anything I did like in this movie, besides Shia? Yes. I did like the spiritual overtones the movie had. The film has overly religious characters, atheists, and Satanists, and I did think this dichotomy was interesting; in a way, the movie could be a sort of retelling of the book of Job. However, that doesn't excuse how terrible the movie is in every other aspect. ""The Tax Collector"" is a movie I would recommend to no one, not even Shia lovers like myself.",The Tax Collector

In the case of the 2 main characters, that understanding comes with a terrible cost and it comes....too late...this was one of the better gang flicks and ultraviolent as expected... shia's performance and his nemesis are the standouts here and make this film worth seeing...just shia's total immersion in the role is a treat to watch.. cool movie with a different vibe than most..",The Tax Collector

42,TuesdayThe17th,"Reminiscent of ""Spring Breakers""",9,9 October 2020,"Ok firstly, this movie is very good. Yes there is a lot of weak writing and some of the scenes seem out of place but it is still entertaining enough nonetheless. The beginning starts out a lil dull but the film builds momentum as it gets going. Personally, I feel it would have been better as a film about Creeper with him as the main character and with David as the second to main. Shia Labeouf was immersed in his role as Creeper and he turned in the best performance of all the actors. Most people that watch this movie will be coming for Shia but staying for the mean spirited final act. Shia usually plays some variation of himself in literally every role he has ever done except for ""Honey Boy"" and sort of now this film. Shia has seemed to lose himself in the character of Creeper, becoming a victim for the screen in a turn of horrifying gang related events, allowing himself to be scene in a humans most vulnerable state: helpless at the hands of a killer. All the while, though, he was still portraying a personality that isn't too far from his own, im sure. Overall this movie is really good and doesn't deserve the bad reviews. In ways it reminds me a lot of ""Spring Breakers"" and I was wondering when another movie with that feel would come out. The actor who played Conejo was quite good as his character was rather menacing, committing atrocious acts. The way he spoke and acted was very similar to that of Gucci Mane's character from ""Spring Breakers"". They even smoked their cigarettes the same way and they are both rappers as well. I totally don't get the bad reviews for this film. Yea, it wasn't the best movie ever made but it is definitely a decent one. The 4.7 rating is wayy too low. Deserves a 5.4 at least",The Tax Collector

48,Slarkshark,"""I Heard You're the Devil."" ""I Might Be""",7,8 May 2021,"Alright, so I do not believe this is as bad as everyone is making it out to be. David Ayer's 'End of Watch' is one of my all time favourites, and no doubt is the most realistic cop movie out there. So whenever he has a new movie I get a little excited, though I've been mostly let down with everything he has done since. And make no mistake, 'Tax Collector' is no exception and is not great. I'm being generous giving it a 7, as a 6 would probably be more suiting.Shia LaBeouf actually does a good job with his character, but his limited screen time is a shame because I went in thinking he was the main. It's a bit of weird casting, but like I said, he was actually a highlight. I didn't care for Bobby Soto's performance. I would have liked to have seen Lou Diamond Phillips as Cornejo.The team up for the final fight was cool; a bit tacky maybe but I enjoyed it and made for a satisfying ending.",The Tax Collector
49,MinistryofDoom,This should have been a film about Creeper,3,30 September 2020,"I had high hopes for The Tax Collector. I mean, look at that cool poster! I thought it was going to be something fast-paced, exciting, and full of action. I thought it was going to be something like Sicario, but I was wrong. David Ayer wrote and directed this crime drama about L.A. street gangs. Not unfamiliar territory for him; he did End of Watch, Training Day, Street Kings and the very first installment of the now blockbuster franchise, The fast and The Furious. So, theoretically, he should have been able to write and direct a really strong, really successful film in this genre. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The Tax Collector started out strong but at about 35 minutes in, it fell apart and I found myself extremely bored. The saving grace of this film is Creeper, played by Shia LaBeouf. He was dark, mysterious, ultra-violent and extremely interesting, but he was only a second fiddle to Bobby Soto's main character, David Cuevas, an enforcer turned rising crime boss in the LA gang scene. Had the film been mainly about Creeper, it would have been so much better.",The Tax Collector

I'd almost question this being solely David Ayers work as I know it so well. That being said you could feel his artwork present In this piece. Definitely well done and even though I am a huge fan of Shia and totally biased in the right ways. I feel like this role he played was captivating. Similar but not close enough to Christian bales in harsh times. I imagine Shia took it that way but wasn't given the proper return. Shia was top notch but the story was David Ayers most ""unthentic"" piece. If that is even a word. What I'm trying to say is David dropped the effort of making it 110% realistic and instead swapped it for WHATS most current: which is okay and it worked. However I don't think I have ever gave David Ayers work an 8 before. It's always 10s across the chart. If it was any other writer or director I probably would have only gave it a 7.

What a strange roll for him to take.This is definitely David Ayer's worst film he's ever made and it's right up there with Harley Quinn's Birds of Prey for the worst film of 2020.

I just saw Training Day for a 4th time a few months back. Given, this one isn't on the same level or production, it ain't bad.It had some fun old gangster scenes with fun violence. Guns, women and drugs. La Familia, I get it. It is an easy movie, like a good Friday movie with some buds (both beer and friends) and a large pizza. I liked the paste in the movie and the soundtrack. It's a bit cheesy here and there, but I did not mind, as I did not know what to expect really. I don't watch trailers.Please, don't believe all the bad reviews, they don't give the movie justice. I'm not a super Shia LaBeouf fan, but I honestly think he did a pretty good job here. And, Jose Conejo Martin is just pure gangster to the bone. He got me excited and delivered a really evil and ugly part in the movie.Don't expect Training Day and don't expect a Denzel Washington worthy performance. Other than that, just enjoy this little ($30 million) gangster movie and have fun. 7/10",The Tax Collector
64,shawnmikedryer,"Fans of ayer, thirst is quenched",7,21 January 2021,"David is a family man and one that would do absolutely anything for his family. David goes nowhere without his right hand man Creeper, the two have careers one wouldn't call conventional. Employed by local crime lord by the name of 'The Wizard' working as 'tax collectors' in Los Angeles. The job entails working as the gangs enforcers, where they travel around the city making collections while forcing clients to pay up by any means necessary. Many collections are met with violent encounters as a display of power is always required. When an old nemesis of David and Creeper's boss by the name of Conejo resurfaces, and is out for revenge to seize and and upend the business. This threat proves to be more than just a nuisance and really hits close to home with David forcing him to put up or shut up in order to preserve the world he created.David Ayer has been known for the brutality in his movies and this film epitomizes that fact. Admittedly the script may leave much to be desired at times but was not quite the films aim. It aimed to be a action packed gangland style film and delivered that very well. If not for any other reason watch this film for spectacular performances by Shia LeBeouf and Bobby Soto, bold to call this Soto's breakout performance he was truly electric near the end. Won't knock your socks off but certainly worth a look.",The Tax Collector

Shia LaBeouf was excellent and he was actually very intimidating which is something i didn't think i would ever say about him and Bobby Soto did a good job too, he really sold the emotions his character was going through.Is it as great as other movies he's made like Fury and End Of Watch? Not really but does it deserve a 4.7 on IMDB? Hell no, this is a fine movie which fans of this genre should enjoy.

And why there's a random white guy pretending to be a Mexican gangster iis beyond me. Rather stupid and kind of forced to say the least. So it naturally added zero t the movie "" bang bang"". Must be nice to just play around with your friends. And everyone gets cut a nice check at the end of the day, Cant imagine it taking much longer to film. Typical cash grab template.

I could see critiquing some minor points, such as the pacing, but overall this film holds up very well and does a great job of capturing the gang atmosphere without resorting to stereotypes. The characters seem authentic, although the brutality might be somewhat exaggerated. The cartels are obviously extremely cruel and violent but this film takes place in America where in reality the violence is generally less severe. It's about two enforcers who mostly do routine collections but get caught up in an escalating turf war. It's a great street-level perspective on cartels operating in America and a great watch for a fan of such material. As an added bonus, it has a great Latin Rap soundtrack. Those who give it a low rating probably should be watching something else, just as I avoid all the comic superhero movies because I don't like them, although I never claim they are bad.",The Tax Collector

80,blazesuncaster,A sad mess,3,19 August 2020,"The Tax Collector was written and directed by David Ayer, who brought us films such as Fury and End of Watch. Despite rumors of this film being good because Shia LaBeouf took it to the next step and got his whole body tattooed, doesn't save this film from being a huge plot hole of messes. The Tax Collector brings nothing to the table besides some well choreographed fight scenes, but that is at the very minimum. The bland vision behind this film is what really destroyed its potential, with lazy writing, sloppy directing, and acting. The only good thing that came from this movie was the potential that Shia had, his acting was top notch with the script he was handed. Of course we all know that Shia has a background of taking things a bit far, with cutting his face for ""fury"", tattooing his whole front body, and even getting arrested while filming ""the peanut butter falcon."" The sheer lack of chemistry between each character makes it seem as if I'm watching test footage. Stupid plot holes that add nothing to the story besides some cliche drama found in these types of movie. It's just such a shame to see a movie fail so badly, with a director that has a good background of directing and writing film. But, Shia's performance and some well choreographed fight scenes doesn't save this film from being an absolute train wreck of cinema.",The Tax Collector
81,deanocware,Well acted if not necessarily well plotted,5,26 January 2021,I decided to watch the tax Collector primarily to see Shia LaBeouf who I have enjoyed in some movies when he plays the antagonist. This is a movie about two men who are tasked with collecting the cut that is owed to the big boss of the local Los Angeles gangs. Shia LaBeouf plays what is meant to be the ruthless enforcer who makes sure that everyone pays what they are supposed to pay. Unfortunately I believe the role was just a little too much for Shia LaBeouf to pull off. Not only does he never really seem all that intimidating but he never really does anything in the movie to try and convince you. In fact I cannot recall him executing anyone other than in the initial flashbacks. So again I think the movie suffered from some of the plotting where you want to portray this guy as a cruel enforcer who really never does anything but get killed. That being said I thought the premise was fairly plausible and the actors in general did a good job of trying to act out the story. I just kept waiting for Shia LaBeouf to do his thing and it just never happened. This is not Breaking Bad. But it's not terrible either.,The Tax Collector

Conejo was a surprise (I thought he was in jail still!) and he was strong. perhaps that last scene he was in went over the top, (i won't give anything away) but i think it was meant to not be taken literally....sort of like the way they did 'deerhunter'. George Lopez and the man who played the african american gang leader (sorry I don't recall his name, but he played same role in 'training day') were two great performances.
the two leads, maybe Shia outshone david a bit. but in a way im glad they did not have lebouf be the main thing.
on the topic of lebouf, he was excellent, but I was trying to figure out, and still am, was her portraying a latino? or was his character white? I am sincerely trying to figure that one out. to the point i was listening for clues like if anyone said 'guero' , etc. but I just cannot tell.
on a personal level i loved the showing of the bridges going into E.L.A.

If you want to know what gang life is like, watch this movie and you still won't know. The funniest part is the portrayal of Shia Lebeouf's character as some bad-a** killer and he get's taken out like an amateur. The dialogue is incredibly off between the two ""tax collectors"", ""do you meditate?"".

My guess is when the score settles down after enough people watch it, it'll hover around a 5.8. But, if you like violent crime movies, I recommend checking this out. It is not very long, so there is not too much opportunity cost (it's about 85 minutes I think).The dialogue did come off kind of tongue-in-cheek at times. Shia did great, as always. Even though I did enjoy being entertained by the movie, I wish it played out differently than it did. I am not saying it has a bad ending. The ending was okay for me and where most of the action is. I wish certain characters in the film played a bigger role in the overall resolve of the movie. This might not make sense, but if you watch it, you'll probably know what I am talking about.The visuals/cinematography was good. The acting was mostly good. The dialogue was hit or miss. Some of the stuff that was said was kind of corny. One non-spoiler example of corny dialogue would be ""Take this gun, it has a lot of murders on it."" The way that line was delivered made me cringe. There are a few other examples of that in the movie.I also feel like the movie did not come full circle. Sure, there might be a tiny bit of a twist...but I would have liked to see the actual last clip to have been in a different setting to bring the film full circle. Again, this probably makes no sense unless you've seen it and remember how the film begins.It is hard to write a review without spoiling anything. Basically, if you like shoot 'em up crime movies, it's worth checking out. The characters do not go into much depth, but at an 85 minute runtime, that's kind of expected.I feel like this movie would have been much better if movie theaters were still open; and they had to run test screenings. Maybe a couple changes could/would have been made to improve the film...but I know that Covid, and the realization of a lower ROI of this film without a box office, may not justify investing too much additional work into it.It will entertain you, but it could have been better....and it probably would have been if Covid wasn't making things more challenging for filmmakers at this time. It's worth a watch, and I think a lot of frustration from the critics is due to the potential this film had. With more character development, some dialogue changes, maybe change up a couple scenes...there is a lot of potential for a great movie. It did feel a little rushed, but hey, I was entertained.6/10. That's what I give movies that entertain me, but won't stick with me for very long. Worth watching, but probably not worth re-watching.

114,ericfield-53542,Just not enough to make it what it could've been,6,12 August 2020,I was really looking forward to this movie. I've always liked Shia as an actor and an Ayer movie is pretty good. I've read some of the comments about the movie and my complaints are basically the same as theirs. I don't want to figure out the script ten minutes into the movie but I also don't want to be blindsided in a bad way. Creeper was made out to be this bad a** man and I was so looking forward to seeing him let loose. He doesn't even get the chance! I don't want to give away too much but Shia was the reason I paid for the movie and he was second fiddle to the main character. I do think it's pretty cool that this movie seems to take place in the same world as Training Day with Denzel and Ethan Hawke. Now that's how a movie with two main characters is done!,The Tax Collector

Well killed the little he was giving. I read a lot of reviews trying to see what the hate is about, seems a combination of Shia wasnt in it long enough or some bad script (which I don't understand) but hey it is what it is. The plot was simple enough to understand a man that would do anything for his family no matter what, could it have needed some touching up yeah. Action wise tho, it was damn good film.

The acting and dialogue from LaBeouf and Soto was embarrassing to watch. I finally turned it of at one point where a 'scary' boss asks to speak to his underling and proceeds to quietly laugh into the phone before hanging up. Very intimidating... and cringe worthy.

124,Steve_Holt_,Real good gang-life movie about morals and costs,8,23 November 2020,"Yet another movie poorly rated because the majority of audiences no longer know how to watch movies. If Robert Downey Jr. doesn't show up at the end to explain the payoff, through a moral truism, most movie watchers seem to be completely lost. Ugh.To be very clear: this move has good character development, a solid story, and realistic dialogue.I think one of the main challenges that people might have had is a lack of connection or understanding to the subject matter. I have a friend who used to be MS-13 and he said, years ago, exactly what this movie is about: you can't play around with being a good person in this world. You either live a good life, doing good things, or you be a gangster and it's all you are. If you try to be a good person in a bad life, the evil will get you. You may get out, but there WILL be a cost.That's what this movie is about. We see the two main characters being developed, David prays, and claims God is watching over him. Meanwhile, his buddy Creeper, refuses Christianity, and even invokes eastern meditation. They're relatively good guys in a bad world. They're involved in bad business, but they have good sides to them. More to the point, David is a relatively good guy; he collects money for gangs and threatens people who don't pay, but he acknowledges God and shows his kindness at timesUnfortunately for David, as we learn, the world he exists in IS evil. I won't give any spoilers, but there are costs to existing in the world he operates in, and you can fool yourself that you're a good guy and going to be ok, but if you try to be good while doing bad work, you'll be eaten alive by those who are dedicated to evil.The ironic complaints to me are about the dialogue. I've grown up around a lot of Mexican gangs as well as a couple friends who were MS-13, and I thought the dialogue was very authentic. As soon as David and Creeper were in their SUV talking back and forth I cringed at how much it made me feel like I were hanging out with some of my old buddies. The problem is that most people don't know how these guys really talk, I have to imagine, and ironically, movies try to sound like real life, while real life gangsters and such try to sound like they're ultra hard. So it's sort of a funny cyclical thing where if you want to sound authentic, then you also have to sound pretty cheesy since the real things are constantly posturing and trying to sound like the movies.One last note. As I was watching and feeling like the writer/director knew his stuff, I was wondering if they would get into a key aspect of the gang life that doesn't get any attention (a very dark aspect of it), and I was surprised to see they actually did get into it, which also made for the roughest scene in the movie. But again, it goes to show they knew their stuff when they made this movie.I definitely recommend it to anyone who is into gang life/organized crime type movies. If you're not, there may not be enough to make this worthwhile to you since it's definitely a dive into the moral plays in the criminal underworld.Final note: I don't like movies that praise criminals, and some might think that's what's going on in this movie. IT IS NOT. This is a study on an aspect of life that most people don't relate to. What might seem pointless to some viewers is everyday life to others.",The Tax Collector

The 2 leads were very good. The film starts off tense due to the fact that anyone these 2 ""collectors"" encounter could pop off at anytime. Also, the special appearance by the black gang leader from End of Watch was a neat surprise. I have 2 problems with this film: 1) The quickness in which George Lopezs character is killed - in a scene where he tells his son he's headed out to deal with the rival gang leader, a female comes in literally 2 seconds later telling his son hes been captured and to meet with the rival gang leader who has his severed head already in a cooler. 2) the wimpy way Shia 's bad boy character & his crew went out - they didn't even put up a fight!

Now to the movie; it is ok! I think there's good build up to an outcome mostly predictable yes, and while he tries to not make it so predictable, it ends up like that. I think the first two acts of the movie were actually being well constructed, but then the last act seems rushed - it could be that there was not enough script development to fill in or studio pressure to cut the movie run time - and the ending is overly simple. But one can still enjoy the effort, the diversity in the movie and, the possibility of understanding the world he tried to portray. I liked Bobby Soto as lead; he pushed himself hard to bring depth to the role and for most part feels credible, and Shia LaBeouf, he is good too, finally has the kid feel stripped off him and it feels great.",The Tax Collector

I guess the whole point to this story is that at some point even the bad guys have to decide how bad is bad and when loyalty, honor, love, and family is tested, how far will one to keep what little piece of humanity and legacy they have left.

I wished they did more with his character because he was the movie. Bobby Soto (David) was also good but the rest of the cast is where the acting gets weaker even though I did enjoy Cinthya Carmona (Alexis). Jimmy Smits part was very small which sucks cause he is talented. George Lopez was completely horrible, he never needs to play a crime boss ever again.

I guess the reason for this was because if they made a trailer that represented the film accurately then there would have been considerably less interest. There just wasn't any substance here. Instead, it was filled with typical David Ayer imagery and cliche. Even the scenes where gun fighting was going on at were just trite. The main character bust into a room with his automatic weapon pointed at the 2 people in Bed and miraculously misses both of them...obviously because there needed to be more of a build up to add some drama for the conclusion but drama can't be built up if there's no compelling story. There were two things about it I liked though. Although Shia's character never really got fleshed out, I felt he was great w what he had to work with.

Were they under the impression it's never been done before? Did they feel they had something new to offer this overcrowded genre? Because if they did, they were sorely mistaken. It just lurched from one cliche to the next; Main character collects from the nastiest gangs in LA - but really, he's a teddy bear with a heart of gold. Ugh. A family man. Ugh. And a man of God and morals. Ugh. We had awful buddy chats in the car (a wee laugh about the fact they're psychopathic killers). Then we had moments with the kids to drive home the idea they're really good guys. Cut to a martial arts training montage reminiscent of bad 80's straight to video action flicks. Flashbacks to happier days like something a teenager would do in a 48hour film fest (but at least they'd do it with a sense of irony). And if that wasn't bad enough, the writers even added some clumsy exposition to make sure we could keep up (with an infantile plot a 4 year old could follow?). There was violence sure - if you like that kind of thing, but it was artlessly done and for the most part, unnecessary . Acting? Ugh. Art direction and grade. Ugh.

It's almost like a 15 year old child wrote dumpster fire for their acting class in high school. ugh, the movie had a lot of potential and could have been a great gangster film but the writing, the lines, and production was piss poor.

Really, the bloods are helping the tax collector for no apparent reason except that he is 'Real?' So dumb...Ayer's usual gritty, raw and realistic depth is missing here sans a few brief moments from Shia.

Running in at just over 90 minutes, it feels that the film is rushed, and doesn't make the most of the fenetic actions scenes David Ayer is famous for, managing to only get one in extremely briefly.If more thought, time and money was put into the film, it could have been much more akin to End of Watch, but falls quite short of it. Short enough to call the film bad? I wouldn't say so. Shia LaBeouf carries his role as Creeper extremely well, but again this doesn't feel like it is explored nearly enough, but there's enough there to make this film a solid ""eh, it's okay"".Given that there's a lot of significantly worse films out there with a higher rating e.g. The Evil Dead (2013), which has zero redeeming qualities, has abysmal acting, terrible script, garbage pacing etc coming in at a higher rating, I feel this film is overly criticized, although don't expect anything that's close to greatness.",The Tax Collector

Underboss thinks he's hard but when faced with a challenge he runs away. Goon is hella suped up that he doesn't even realize he's puss. And, any other tough guy gets deleted before they can even do anything.No empathy for the loss of family as that was brought on by their own actions. This was a film I laughed as the ""hero"" had everything taken away from him.Old Blood set leader decides to ride for a rival gang; ok David is a good guy but what set leader is really going to put their gang on the line for someone elses' issues?The story was a mess, too fast, too short, too ambiguous, too sloppy. Just bad.",The Tax Collector
166,GeorgeWHAMMYBush,Misleading trailer and very bad acting and story,3,8 August 2020,"This seemed like a college made movie. Like something your friend would have made and forced you to watch and you'd say it was good but really it was just the effort you'd be applauding.
It's mind boggling that this came from a union director.
The acting is terrible. Just awful. The editing too. The shot composure is inconsistent.
The story is outright laughably cliche.
I only gave it a 3 because of the marketing. They did a great job making this look like it was a real movie but really this is junk.",The Tax Collector
167,kevinlloyd-26393,"Strong start, but an overall disappointment",3,16 August 2020,"A solid start and sprinkled with well done scenes, but overall a disappointment. It has promise, but spirals, and never lives up to what it could have been. By the end, you still don't care about the characters. Well acted, though.Not even sure why Shia is in this. They waste every opportunity to use his character. Supposedly he got tattoos for this role, but we never see them.Don't waste your time.",The Tax Collector
168,garneragency,Enjoyable.,7,9 August 2020,"So much hate for this movie, for no reason. I had a good time. Shea was pretty damn good in this and I've never been a huge fan of his. If you enjoy David Ayers films, then ignore the hate and just give it a try.",The Tax Collector

If you felt any hype from the trailer you will be disappointed.
The movie is slow, never shows why every gang fear/respect them and the end its so stupid with a speech like they are good guys because ""family""
It waste the best character and the action is horrible and in so little that it's a waste of time.",The Tax Collector
171,mills71,Good until it wasn't,6,20 August 2020,"Started out really good, fast pace, good tone, good performances by the lead actors . The last 30 minutes were cut scenes, a montage, oddly filmed action scenes and it was like a different director stepped in at the last minute.
Shia Lebouf was good in it, he's done some good work lately and this was right on par. Wait till it's free and check it out.",The Tax Collector
172,KooLLaiD,Don't waste your time,2,10 August 2020,"Seriously, what a jumbled, pointless mess. Shia was the reason everyone wanted to watch this movie and his part is so under utilized. He wasn't the main character like all the trailers made him out to be, and he's by far the best actor in this movie. He is touted as ""the devil"" and you're expecting some John Wick type stuff from him and they don't even show him getting any action.

174,Leakage300,"Not unwatchable, but...",6,16 August 2020,"I thought when it worked, it did so in aces. But it had its flaws, and could've done with patching up the plot surrounding a few characters. Overall, decent flick. When David Ayer directs a movie as such, with gang elements in L.A, it scares me that it's inspired by his upbringing, and some of the stuff he comes up with makes you ask about the harsh realities in the lives of many we don't know. Still an Ayer fan, but have to admit, miss the feel of his earlier works.P.S. Shia is fast becoming one of my favorite actors.",The Tax Collector
175,tahirk-74696,8 for effort - you either hate it or love it,8,18 April 2021,I loved it simply because I recognised the universe this is set in the same one Training Day introduced us to then a variety of movies exploited this new genere sometimes to good effect (Pulp Fiction don't forget) and there were some greats like Harsh Times but this first in really well and if you watch it from the context of any/all of the predecessors...then it makes sense and you can adjust your fantasy to accommodate the characters and fill in the gaps in the story.But if you go into this movie with a certain production quality in mind it doesn't have.Also note there are two versions of this movie I personally know of there may be others doesn't surprise me this wasn't a low take movie you can tell which gives this move some depth.The Amazon HD version i watched was more brutal and had better dialogue time I felt but not as well edited as the one obviously used for the trailer.Shia was great as ever loved his Creeper character you have one in every circle of life.,The Tax Collector

And the main character isn't really interesting to me Shia Labouf's character was way more interesting and I would have liked to see some more back story to him and some action but they kill him off half way through!

184,mvanekadhi,Not as bad as people have said,7,15 August 2020,I'm not sure what people expected here. It was not a bad movie. It wasn't anything special but I don't think it was intended to be. Audiences don't even know what they want anymore. Everything gets cancelled if it's not PC or whatever. Shia did a good job and the movie was decent.

I say Shia LaBeouf part and it was a little overhyped because he just doesn't get as much screen time as you thought he would. He's great in this movie, he is totally believable.

195,filmeddows-59524,I don't understand the Hate,7,31 August 2021,"First of, this is not a Shia LaBeouf film. His character is nothing more than a supporting character. Also if your expecting a massive action film with Shia being a bad ass like Bruce Willis. This is not the film for you. However a prequel to this film with Shia LaBeouf character would be amazing.THIS IS A CARTEL MOVIE...It is about organized crime within the ghetto's. It plays on those classic mafia type tropes. I actually really enjoyed the fresh take on it.I have no idea why this has received so much hate. It is a low budget film with a big budget aesthetic. All the characters are believable and there is a good mix of drama, violence and exploitation.Bobby Soto the main character is an up and coming to look out for.Great crime drama with the classic showdown at the end.

Shia LaBeouf is what sells the reason to even wanna see it and it sells. Most the characters you see are small times thugs you see in gangster movies who got lead roles in this film.

You are made to believe that Shia is at very least equal footing with the real lead of this film, Soto. Shia's character is woefully under used and is meant to be the devil, fearsome and savage but is never let of the leash and only finds himself murdered in the most savage of manners two thirds of the way through.You keep expecting that at some point he will raise hell and put a few wrongs right but instead he is neutered.This film only delivers a depressing, morbid and bloody take on gang life in LA. And that no matter how big you are there is always someone out there willing to kill you to take that crown temporarily until the next coup comes.I cannot recommend this film to anyone. Its no training day.",The Tax Collector
201,jpobrien16,Could be so much better,6,12 August 2020,I could easily make this a great movie. Build up a major character and then kill him off half way through. No logic to the ending and no one to cheer on at the ending. You build up a bad ass character but never release him.,The Tax Collector

It's embarrassing this film had the team it had, and what they put out. This film has no heart. What starts out as kinda bad turns into horrible. The first noise the film has, is a child screeching and the audio mix in itself is a goof. Both characters are horrible people with nothing redeemable. The writing is abysmal and offers nothing of insight. There is no action. The performances are entirely wooden. The pacing is so shotty that a 90 minute film feels like 2 hours 45 minutes in. When the action begins, you realized that this film just nose dived off a cliff into some of the worst moments of writing, acting and cinematography you'll ever witness.

Full of ego around all the time but no one is doing anything, just talking.LaBeouf, kept talking and he got shot at the first gun fight and then dead. What was that?What about the tatoo? We kept seeing news about his tatoo, his commitment but you dont see it in the movie. Only once when he is dying, covered full of bloood.Man, also he as supposed to be scary but with those ears he had in the movie and the size of his body he is like the wizard from pixars onward.Complete waste of time...

First off, did they really try to make Shia Lebouf the scary mass murderer that the whole hood is afraid of? I'm not saying his acting was bad or anything, but scary is one thing he will never be. That being said, his character should have at least had the chance to actually do something gangsterish before getting taken out. Next, the plot was pretty generic with essentially two big crews going after each other, and it was pretty hard to believe that after the half dozen or so guys at their little sit-down all got killed, there was NO ONE else to come help?? Not exactly a very powerful gang if the whole thing can get taken out in seconds. I did like how the Bloods came to his aid in the end (don't ask me why) but the ending left a lot to be desired in my opinion. After all, Mr. Demonic Gangbanger did say he was just following orders so why did we never get to find out who was pulling his strings? Sure seems like the cartel will still be after him and take him out soon after the movie ends. I've seen worse movies this year for sure, but I truly feel like it wouldn't have taken much effort to make this a far better movie than it was. Watchable? Sure. Forgettable? Absolutely.",The Tax Collector

most of the time was spent making the main actor look cool for being a cartel badarse and the bits that actually mattered were rushed.

And they're also marred by some terrible effects. Shia is absolutely WASTED on the movie. He's hands down the best actor, and the story totally under uses him. And the script totally mistreats his presence.All of this happens in a drawn out pace that leaves the climax to fall very flat.

Shia never the best actor plays a role that makes absolutely no sense. The acting is awful, the film is full of awful cliches and you know what is going to happen every step of the way because of these cliches. It is definitely a white director thinking he understands the LA gang and minority culture and it fails in every level.If you run across the film while bored like I did don't watch it. If someone tells you it is good call them a liar. If someone says you should watch it cut ties with that person. If any of those actors or director ever get another job after that train wreck movie there should be an investigation in to it. I as sit here I mourn the little Digital 0s And 1s that gave their binary code lives for this movie. It was so bad we may want to consider protesting it. We should all meet in Hollywood and insist that this movie be pulled so innocent people do have to suffer. The only good part of this movie is the first 1/10th of a second when the end credits start because you realize that you'll never be subjected to it again..In fact, I should get money for the pain and suffering I experienced writing this review but I need to warn others.

It starts off interesting but then he goes all over the place and just feels like the movie is being fast forwarded for you. If you are watching this for Shia just stick to the previews because those are all of his scenes. Shia's acting is great as usual. I am just disappointed on how they did his character. They portray his character as this heartless killer but when it came down to being that it doesn't happen. The summary of this movie or more interesting than the actual movie. Not too much action either. I think if they have would made the movie a full two hours then maybe it would have a chance.

254,zacfil_607,Not really worth it,4,12 January 2021,"I saw a trailer for this and thought to myself ""wow that looks pretty good.""
However upon watching it I was rather disappointed.Yes one of the main reasons I wanted to see this was Shia LaBeouf being a badass. After looking up the film I assumed this was a small time film (directed, written by someone newer in the business) but then I found out that it was David Ayer that did both.I believe this movie could have been way better, but the lack of character focus and writing was pretty dull that you never care for people dying, or are shocked when bad things happen.I've heard good things about Harsh Times, Street Kings but have never seen them.
Ever since Suicide Squad I think Ayer's work is either dipping or just hit and miss depending on who is taking part in the film's production.Fury, Training Day (2001), End of Watch are great examples of David Ayer's better works (directed and written by) and i suggest you watching one of those over The Tax Collector.This movie is the gang version of End of Watch though it lacks substance, creativity, and all around story telling. This movie is something you can put on in the background ignore it for 20 minutes, look back at it and not miss anything.I would have given this movie a 3 but i really enjoyed Shia's performance.",The Tax Collector

In the movie Shia Labeouf was really betrayed as this bad a$$ the first half of the film but it never showed how bad a guy he really was and the main character and villain fell flat by weak character development. Maybe it was cut short due to filming restrictions because of covid, not sure, but they really missed an opportunity for what could've been an epic film, but overall a decent movie and the last half of the movie is action packed.

Street Kings, End Of Watch, Sabotage, etc. Which were all very good movies. So I was in.Starts off with promise. Several characters that you want to learn more of. Yet you never get the chance. Shia Labeouf was used just as a draw and nothing more. Intriguing plot that was wasted here as so much more could've been done with it. Lacked character development, especially that of the aforementioned Shia's ""Creeper"". Just ends up being a jumbled mess with very little action, and when you do get any action scenes they are very poorly pieced together shots that are hard to make out on screen.

Speaking of the trailer, if you have seen it, then you have seen literally every scene shia LaBeouf was in, not very much. If you're watching this for shia LaBeouf, you will be disappointed.

Then if you've seen David Ayers other gritty LA Street Drama you know what's going to happen.

On the whole, the movie doesn't make sense. And I don't mean it doesn't make sense in like an artsy sort of way. Like, legitimately, it just flat out doesn't make any sense.

It's kind of messy, a little all over the place and could have been a way better movie. But it does have a beginning (takes a minute to see where it's headed) and the end is o.k.

When, in the beginning of the movie, a guy gets in a car to drive to work in a tracksuit and suddenly wear a totally different outfit, I'm quickly getting the idea I'm not being taken serious. A continuity error so early on? C'mon.But it's not all bad, even tho' sometimes it cringily written. Just: don't expect too much.

I think we all expect Shia to take the center stage, but when the movie takes a different turn it catches you off guard. I for one have gotten to a point where all movies are predictable and this one I did not expect to end this way. It's also good to see a minority take the center stage and play the hero of the movie working along side other minorities. David Ayers and Shia LaBeouf have always allowed their movies to speak to their politics and I respect it because it makes me feel as though the characters are reflective the actors real life character traits and beliefs.

359,monkeystyle-98485,Was it really written by David Ayer??,2,16 August 2020,"How can such a gifted Writer and Director make such a bad movie? Like other users have mentioned the trailer is misleading, peppered with the 'better' scenes and wrongly spotlighting Shia LaBeouf as the main protagonist.The character development was thin at best. The Protagonist 'David' is essentially a conflicted anti-hero but we're supposed to care just because he has a family, kisses his wife a lot and decides one day enough is enough? If he was really in that line of work he would be a lot more scarier and psychotic rather than reading off some 'cool' lines to scare the other criminals. Screenwriting 101 - ""Show don't tell"".And where was Shia is all of this? Standing next to him, looking tough, always threatening but never really fulfilling his character's potential. And Shia talking about meditating and zen-like philosophy? What?? Are we going to see a yoga scene next? David and Creeper in the studio wearing spandex and juicing together...It seems to me this should've been Shia's movie. Less talk, more Creeper taking the reigns, doing more badass stuff and David doesn't like it. Create conflict between the brotherhood dynamic. Think Christian Bale and Freddy Rodriguez's relationship in Harsh Times (a great movie I might add). Maybe the Gandalf character (or whatever he was called) puts a hit on Creeper and David has to suck it up. Thats the business. Whatever. Something that could've built on David's conflicted conscience, not just loose plot points.Plot-wise it was comparable to a bad finger painting. You could kind of see what it was about but was muddled, sloppy and incomprehensible at the same time. Made me wonder if this was something David Ayer wrote when he was a kid and found at the bottom of a pile of good scripts.The action scenes were entertaining at times however it seemed like these were just filler scenes to mask some terrible acting.Overall, I guess like other reviews I had high hopes for this as I'm a fan of David Ayer but something about this fundamentally was off. Was it rushed through production and editing? Did David Ayer actually get a say in the script development? Was the budgeting decided by an accounts manager with a gambling habit? Did they shut their eyes and just point when casting? I don't know.I guess if you don't care about story structure, character development and just want to see some action whilst doing your own finger paintings then this is for you. All I hope is David Ayer had some sleepless nights after cutting his pay check on this one.",The Tax Collector
360,sddukat,Amazingly Shia is the best part of this terrible bloody mess of a movie,2,18 August 2020,"This movie is like End of Watch for the bad guys of Los Angeles. Very much like End of Watch this movie had all sorts of potential. The L.A. crime vibe is undeniably cool in all periods of history and there is such a good opportunity here to make another Heat or Training Day with a Hispanic protagonist. This movie in concept seemed destined to win. The Tax Collector, however, fails miserably in seizing the opportunity and already belongs in a $5 DVD bargain bin at Walmart.Firstly, almost all of the characters are incredibly shallow and/or cliche. Sadly this includes the protagonist and all of his family, the antagonist and all of his crew, and even the great George Lopez's character Uncle Louis. Amazingly the one bright spot is Shia LeBeouf who plays an interesting antihero role. Though personally I find Shia intolerable in most movies, he actually is the one character with any depth in this movie and I grudgingly admit the part is well-acted.Secondly, the writing and plot is just as shallow and cliche as the characters. The dialogue is mostly horrible with some quirky Shia bromance moments being the only exception. The plot is also completely telegraphed and seemingly taken out of a bad 80s Steven Seagal movie. If you are the kind of person who can sense where plots are headed you will find yourself knowing exactly what will happen at least 10 minutes in advance.Thirdly, to compensate for uninteresting characters a predictable plot there is a lot of gratuitous violence in this movie. This type of crime movie is going to be violent, I get it, but the violence is poorly set up and executed dramatically in all cases... abrupt, cheap, repetitive and generally meaningless to the plot other than to broadly justify revenge.Finally, the tactical consulting and special effects are also of the lowest possible grade for a movie released this century. Gun handling never looks professional with any character. You will not believe most of the actors have ever held a gun before. For John Wick Keanu got months of training with world-renowned experts for each movie, seemingly these guys were just handed prop guns the day of the shoot and told ""Do the best you can."" The effects were also atrocious. Some of the muzzle flashes look like they were drawn with Windows Paint.All in this was a terrible experience I don't recommend to anyone. If you like good movies you will not like this film. You should a) wait until this movie is free on your streaming service of choice, then b) only watch the first 30 minutes just to see Shia in all his absurd gangster glory, and then c) turn the movie off because you already know what's going to happen, thus saving yourself from the bloody mess (literally) that is the rest of this movie.",The Tax Collector

Refreshing to see new LatinX faces as well. I thought the cinematography was nice and the music in this film is great.

I refuse to discredit Bobby Sotos acting in what could possibly be his ""breakthrough performance"" but the expectations I had for Shia Laboufs character far exceeded what the directors dished out. At no point in this film, was I ever invested in a single character. There were so many missed opportunities to make a connection with viewers, and for us to build an attachment to the t.v. screen, and it never happened.

And mentioned he was like some sort of badass, but he didn't get to show off how bad ass he was. He shouldn't have died the way he did and I'm very disappointed of that.

It's probably very awkward and scary to be around them. I thought that came off very well. And Shia lebouf was amazing. The violence I thought seemed real enough. I never seen someone get their head stomped in so I couldn't tell you how real it was. I'm sure if I did, I'd say oh man this looks like a movie, right before I pissed my pants and ran away.

410,johnathan-aleman,David Ayer drops the ball with this film..,3,8 August 2020,I was really looking forward to this movie but what a waste of time and money. This film has so much potential to be a good film even if it is the repeated cliche story about drug cartels and redemption. If you love END OF WATCH and FURY this is nowhere in the same field of those films. Shia steals the show being so involved with his character but Bobby Soto was miscast as the protagonist of the movie. I was not convinced of him being a mexican gangster running the streets of LA. His character barely spoke spanish fluently. The film story is missing depth and the film needed to be longer than its run time it feels rushed.

By the time a character died I hadn't really gotten attached and therefore it just felt like another time-consuming scene-I felt like I must have missed something along the way.

Shea's portrayal of a crazy cartel hit man, who is doing trendy lsd micro dosing, eats healthy, meditates and is probably in to existential philosophy was great, most of the other characters felt quite authentic.
While of course the movie is not without some flaws, some moments I would want to redo and rewrite, overall I enjoyed it.
If you have enjoyed some of previous Ayer's works in the past, while not ""Training Day"", this is certainly worth to see. I'll give it a 7, just to balance out the hate, otherwise it is a 6 to 6.5 for me.",The Tax Collector

They do the same thing with Tyler Perry films because they can't relate, they spread negativity and horrible reviews. Shia and the cast did a wonderful job! I laughed, flinched, and cried. Without too many spoilers, the real reason people are hating is because of the films messages. Some people don't like to see the black and brown pride.

We needed more action from creeper like we saw Christian bale go psycho in harsh times but sadly that wasn't the case. Having said that, this film deserves first place and a gold medal in a high school student film competition because it was just that. Horrible acting, bad character development, unnecessary flashbacks, bad angles, cringe worthy action sequences, and most of all way too rushed.

The movie started out well. Although I feel that David wasn't correctly cast, I feel David (director) did a great job of character development on David. Showing his domestic and spiritual side, then the street biz. There was some lag midway into the movie then picked up again.The interaction with the brothers joining as the cavalry at the rear of the film was where it lost plausibility along with the level of acting skill, but I was already hooked and I rode till the wheels fell off.Getting back to Shai.

The whole time your waiting for some great action, and it never really comes until this weird twisted up scene at the end which comes out of no where, and not in a good way. I'm truly at a loss for words with this one.",The Tax Collector
444,scottpelletier-72879,Wow. Intense.,10,8 August 2020,One of the better gang movies I've seen. It is very dark and gory so not for the faint of heart.,The Tax Collector
445,davidkholy,Damn Shame,4,16 March 2021,"First of let's just say Shia was dope AF in this role. The story was so underdeveloped and the main character (David) and his family/backstory was so lacking in relevance until literally the last 30 mins of the movie that it just sucked all the air out of the room. The whole ""story"" was rushed as so much that it just made you mad. It had the potential to be pretty good at some parts but they just gave up after Creeper died. Like all of a sudden David is a G. If better written maybe a 6 or higher but this writing let me down.",The Tax Collector
446,jhud-74211,Underwhelming,1,25 August 2020,"Big bold looking characters with no bite. Shia did not live up to his hype, instead we get it from a few flashbacks. What a waste of time.",The Tax Collector
447,souravbs,its overrated,4,15 August 2020,Good start but it completely loses its way till the end. wanted more of shia lebeouf and his acting. It just went sideways completely,The Tax Collector
448,tgage-71821,By far the worst of any David Ayer film,2,24 September 2020,"Two stars because I suppose there could be something worse than this disaster of a film, hard as it is to imagine. It feels like they simply gave up very early on in the writing process and just decided to go forward and shoot with what they had: barely anything at all.Over half of the movie is over before anything significant even happens (other than some talking: i.e. Shia LeBeouf's character is on a keto diet for some reason, etc.). The actor playing the ""lead"" lacked charisma and seemed to be lost. Two-thirds of the movie has gone by and there is essentially no character development whatsoever before one of the main characters is killed off, no arc, no stakes, nothing. Just pointless violence and then onto what I guess you could call a third act?At the very beginning it seems like things are being set up to go somewhere, but then it just.. sort of, uh.. it just.. I lost my train of thought. What were we talking about? I could go on, but why bother? I probably put more thought into this review than the writers did with the script.",The Tax Collector
449,markooparac,Sadness in the middle,2,5 September 2020,"Somebody give me back 2 wasted hours of my life back. One of the worst movies I've watched, recommended to blind people only.",The Tax Collector
450,mreynawilliams,LOVED IT,9,17 August 2020,"Loved this movie...action packed, and insane! Loved Shia's character Creeper, and Bobby Soto did an amazing job as well!",The Tax Collector
451,drado-98414,Take it for what it is,7,13 August 2020,Take it for what it is and you can enjoy it.. Don't get all the hate. Not great but far from terrible.,The Tax Collector
452,cabralesthevao,Forget the bad reviews,10,9 August 2020,"The film is perfect on his way. The film is about choices, family, hustle, hood and loyalty. You can see all of that in the film. Just watch, is worth.",The Tax Collector
453,blbrownie,Spoiler.......,7,9 August 2020,Couldn't wait to see this movie!!! Couldn't wait th see Shia as a badass......ultimately I got nothing but disappointment. You killed every good actor off. These directors need to sit down and watch good movies...... you don't do this to your top actor,The Tax Collector
454,kajcsapapa,Dope Movie,10,26 October 2020,"Movie is dope. It isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, there are some plot holes but overall the acting was great. I was surprised by Shia's and Conejo's performance. It's refreshing to see a real movie coming out amongst all that superhero bulllshhhh that Hollywood's been pumping out for the last couple of years.",The Tax Collector
455,mandalupo,I would rather watch paint dry,2,17 January 2021,"I can't grasp how a movie like this gets funding, like all movies you give it 5 mins in the beginning and I shouldn't have because now I have lost 2 hours of my life I won't get back. I wouldn't even recommend this movie if you had absolutely nothing to do.",The Tax Collector
456,kingmic,It wasn't as bad as people say,9,19 August 2020,"I enjoyed the movie for what it was. I'm not ranking 9/10 for screenplay, writing, acting, and Oscar worthy but for how much I enjoyed it for what it was for. Now maybe I should give it an 8 possibly. But Shia was definitely the actor I enjoyed the most, wish he was in movie longer for sure.",The Tax Collector
