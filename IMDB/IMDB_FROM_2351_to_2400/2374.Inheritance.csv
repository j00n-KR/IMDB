0,nogodnomasters,The Truth must stay Buried,5,19 July 2020,"Lauren Elizabeth Monroe (Lily Collins ) is a hard-nosed City DA going after Wall Street cheats, many of which are associates of her father (Patrick Warburton). Her brother William (Chace Crawford) is running for congress and has union payoff issues for endorsement allegations. When her father passes away, Lauren inherits Simon Pegg chained up in a hidden bomb shelter. At this point, leave you mind at the door and enjoy the interaction and secrets he reveals as Lauren debates his release. The production ends up with a couple of twists that one would expect from a hack writer that ruined everything. It wasn't clever and has been done in too many films. SPOILER: Luke I am your. . .Guide: F-word. No nudity. Beginning of a rape scene.",Inheritance
1,kosmasp,Loss of sense,7,29 September 2020,"Now if stop a minute and think about ... actually anything, you may have a problem. I don't know how long you are able to shake your head in disbelief, but I do know you will get tired before you have reason to actually stop. There are so many things that are wrong, on the story side and even the inciting incident (even if explained and very conveniently placed - by accident (no pun intended), has things attached to it that don't make sense.You can start asking why ... even if you sort can satisfyingly answer the why the female/sister character of the movie and not the brother ... and of course she is the main character, but that alone is just an excuse for the screenwriter. Whom I don't want to bash to much, not knowing what he wrote or who wrote what and what got changed. But it is a mess overall. The actors do save it though and if you can just relax sit back and let the tension and the thrill of the movie take over ... well you can be thoroughly entertained",Inheritance
2,Sleepin_Dragon,What on Earth!!!,4,26 November 2020,"That's one surprise you don't want.Simon Pegg looked like one of the Witches from Macbeth, it's pretty good up until the point where she gets her rather bizarre surprise.There is a reason this film is do cheap to rent, it's not very good. The script is questionable to say the least, the plot is oddly disjointed, and the ending seemed so abrupt, did we get answers to all of the bizarre questions posed? I don't think we did.The real highlight, was Lily Collins, ok so the movie wasn't great, but she did at least get to show that she's a fine actress, her accent was good.Not great unfortunately. 4/10.",Inheritance
3,CinemaSerf,An inheritance nobody would want...,5,23 October 2020,"Every now and then I watch a film and wonder how on earth the writer (in this case Matthew Kennedy) could ever come up with the story... This is undoubtedly one of those films! Lily Collins is ""Lauren"", a high-flying Assistant District Attorney whose wealthy father dies of an heart attack. He leaves the bulk of his fortune to his wife (Connie Nielsen) and cute Congressman son (Chace Crawford) but she receives a surprisingly derisory sum and a mysterious key. When she goes to investigate, nothing can prepare her for what she will find; nor for the consequences of this, frankly preposterous, discovery. For any mystery to be successful, it must have some anchor in plausibility, and boy does this not. The supposedly intelligent, savvy, daughter makes such a surprising series of choices - risky, naive and downright stupid at times - that her character is compromised from way too early on to make this much more than a muddle of a film with Simon Pegg as an extremely unlikely, and unconvincing, protagonist. Worth a watch on a dark, wet, winter's night I suppose - but aim low.",Inheritance
4,bombersflyup,"Watchable, but you won't be revisiting.",4,28 July 2020,"Inheritance while initially intriguing, turns out to be uninspired, unevoking and underwritten.So what's the purpose? The mother Catherine knew who he was, the video and key wasn't given to her. The brother William would just leave him to rot, it wasn't left to him. So it's left to Lauren for what reason? If Archer wanted her to know about him, he would of left information in the bunker, so it can only be some kind of test. Pegg's character turns out to be her father, but that's not solely it. We aren't given the reason. Catherine says ""you're one of us,"" but does she want to be after Archer put her in this position? Who knows. Also did she know if the gun was even loaded, had she ever fired a gun? Seemed sure of herself in these situations. I always had the feeling she'd be in his place at the end, because she never lets anyone know of her whereabouts. She could have told Harold to do something if she went missing, even though he dies. The performances aren't memorable and there's nothing new here, though Lily Collins ain't bad. The brilliant Phil Collins's daughter.",Inheritance
5,Wizard-8,"Not awful, but I was left unsatisfied by it",5,12 October 2020,"I have to admit that the premise for ""Inheritance"" is quite unlike any movie I have seen (or heard about) to date, and that I was kept interested in it to see how things would be wrapped up in the end. However, when the end credits started rolling, I didn't find myself satisfied. As others here have stated before me, this movie has quite a lot of holes in its plot. How did nobody know about the bomb shelter before? Why didn't the heroine's father leave her proper instructions about her ""inheritance""? Then there are questions that come up at the end that the movie does not answer, such as the unmentioned fate of the heroine's brother, who simply disappears from the story. The performers do a pretty good job despite the weaknesses in the material, and the entire production looks okay despite a limited budget. I've seen worse on Netflix, I admit, but I think this is one acquisition you should only look at when you've run out of really good movies to watch there.",Inheritance
6,deloudelouvain,Deserves a much higher rating.,8,26 May 2020,"The only disappointing thing about Inheritance is the ratings it gets on IMDb. To me it's seriously underrated, but then again I'm used to it. It's not the first time that I completely disagree with the ratings, in fact there are a lot of movies with this score that I find very entertaining whilst other very highly rated movies are rather boring to watch. Inheritance has an interesting story, the suspense is building up during the entire movie, with good acting from Simon Pegg and Lily Collins, as well as the rest of the cast. It's one of those mystery movies you keep guessing what happened, one that you know there is something odd about it but you stay eager to find out. So no I really don't get what people don't like about this movie. Sometimes you can see a movie is going to suck after just watching a couple minutes, the amateurism just oozes from the beginning, but with Inheritance I immediatly had the opposite reaction after a couple minutes, you can clearly see the cinematography was going to be good, and a good story and acting made it just slightly more entertaining than a just normal 'good' movie. You can't really go wrong with this movie if you like mystery thrillers.",Inheritance
7,UniqueParticle,A black hole could consume the amount of plots holes!,9,9 September 2021,I've never seen or cared so much about the lack of backstory before otherwise damn this movie is thrilling and Lily Collins is exquisite! There's probably around 50 key elements missing that's nuts for any project. I didn't know about this film before but I got intrigued when it came on HBO; despite the problems Inheritance is pretty good! I must say the hugest plot holes are the relationship throughout and why the Inheritance was decided upon the character. I would recommend to horror fans for sure maybe as much to others.Edit: Gradually I started to absolutely love this movie for what it is!,Inheritance
8,marmar-69780,Inheritance,4,9 August 2020,"If only this film had at least as good story as Simon Pegg performance was,now really his acting saved this film from being even bigger disaster and to me he stole every scene that he was in,Lilly Collins in other hand was way to unconvincing as our character,i mean she give solid performance but her character lacked depth and personality,story was also all over the place and mixture of funny moments and dramatic situations wasnt very good,ending and plot twists were also very uneffective and it felt like they wanted to shock viewers with every means neceserey,but they failed in end,cause they tried way to hard for this kind of film,Inheritance was a film worthy of watch just because of Pegg performance,rest of film was rather unorginized and off",Inheritance
9,arfdawg-1,THoroughly Dumb,2,23 May 2020,"This is truly a dumb movie with a horrible script, idiotic directing and third rate acting.It's made like a TV movie for Hallmark. In other words, cheaply.The acting really stands out as atrocious.",Inheritance
10,jtindahouse,We need more movies like this,9,23 May 2020,"'Inheritance' is the type of movie I love most of all. Full of twists and turns where you never know what is around the next corner. Not enough films like this get made anymore. Early on the film sets up a mystery to centre the plot around and from that moment onwards I was hooked. I needed to know how this was going to turn out. I was not disappointed.There's something extremely appealing to me about watching actors who are mostly known for their comedic roles take on a serious one. Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, Adam Sandler - they've all done it and with great success for the most part. Simon Pegg turns in a serious role in 'Inheritance' and it is absorbing to watch. In fact all the actors in this film do a great job, but his performance certainly stands out among the pack. He is the icing on the cake to what is an already very good movie.These types of films used to be all the rage back in the 90s, but it feels like they burned out and now we hardly ever get them. I would love nothing more than to see them make a comeback and if the quality of 'Inheritance' is anything to go by then there's no reason they couldn't. I would highly recommend giving this one a watch.",Inheritance

12,kluseba,Some secrets are better left untold,9,19 June 2021,"Inheritance is a very decent psychological thriller that is much better than its reputation and deserves your attention and acclaim. The story revolves around the mysterious death of a powerful, selfish and wealthy family patriarch. His daughter is an ambitious attorney who feels offended when she inherits much less than her brother who is a corrupt politician. Instead of offering her a significant share of his wealth, the patriarch reveals a terrifying secret to his daughter via a posthumous video message. The secret revealed in this message is going to change the lives of all family members forever.This movie convinces on numerous levels. First of all, the film oozes with atmosphere. It takes place in a cold mansion, dark forests and sinister bunker. Even the flashbacks take mostly place at night. Numerous scenes will send shivers down your spine.Up next, this movie has an intelligent story. The initial surprise is already highly efficient. The movie however comes around with a few clever twists and turns that gradually lead to a gripping finale.Finally, Inheritance convinces with strong acting performances. Lily Collins shines as self-confident attorney whose life slowly falls apart and leaves her in bleak despair. Simon Pegg convinces as mysterious character with multiple extreme facets. Patrick Warburton leaves his mark as pitiless patriarch whose dark side comes alive in multiple clever flashbacks.In the end, Inheritance is a very good psychological thriller with gripping atmosphere, intelligent plot and strong acting performances. The movie entertains from start to finish and especially its intense finale leaves a lasting impression. Inheritance certainly deserves more acclaim and attention than it has gotten upon release.",Inheritance
13,ks-60500,Entertaining,6,11 June 2020,It's mostly make sense til the end why the dead father leave behind the mission. Wealthy family with all these issues and each character acts just rationalize in that sense. Quite enjoyable when watching this.,Inheritance
14,nancyldraper,Good acting. Flawed premise.,6,29 September 2021,"The acting is good. Lily Collins and Simon Pegg give great performances.

15,omendata,Heading for....An Anticlimax...,6,23 May 2020,"I quite enjoyed the premise and although absurd that is what movies are all about - its not real life to the reviewer who beggars belief and so is the premise of many other movies and that does not make it a bad movie just a creative idea much like many Stephen King movies but this one could not maintain the level of tension/pacing and just petered out from the middle onwards to the rather disappointing ending.That being said it wound its way quite well until the denouement which was a bit of a letdown; the end was a bit of a damp squib, I was expecting something more jaw dropping in the vein of the writers of Saw or Hannibal but no, it runs out of steam like most films these days seem to.Passable entertainment but fails to reach much above the 6th rung on the ten step ladder!",Inheritance
16,Sergiodave,Not as bad as some reviews would make you believe,6,11 October 2020,"A wealth American dies and part of his Daughters inheritance is a dark secret. That is the essence of the plot.Simon Pegg is the standout actor in this movie, showing better acting than in previous non comedy roles. Lily Collins is okay, but a tad unbelievable. The movie moves along at a good pace, and it's okay to watch. Yes, it all seems far-fetched, but not impossible for the super wealthy.",Inheritance
17,ygwerin1,The American Way,6,22 August 2021,"I have just watched this movie on Netflix, I put it on My List there to watch when I felt so inclined. I only bothered to add it because it has Simon Peg in it, and I hadn't seen many of his films. So I was curious to see if he has any acting ability at all, as I have only seen him in jokey films like Paul.I made the mistake of browsing some film reviews and I have to, disagree with what I read because I found them rather trite.For his performance I wouldn't nominate Simon Pegg for even a Bafta, for Best Actor in a Supporting Roll. But fair play to Pegg he wasn't half bad in the roll, and the syrup wasn't as bad as all that. I think he may well have some kind, of acting future ahead of him.The movie has a basic script and storyline and proceeds as something of a Pot Boiler, for those unfamiliar with the term its from an old novel form.I am not sure of the exact origins of the term Pot Boiler, but it certainly harks back through the 1900's. Pot Boilers was a colloquial name for the, plots and storylines of cheaply produced publications.These were known as Penny Dreadful's, a penny was a particularly low value coin of the realm. Before the British currency was decimalised, the pound was worth 240 pennies.The Penny Dreadful was a type of comic in that it was small, and really basic in design and content. The stories were thin and barely kept ticking over throughout, with tiny plot twists or turns to keep the readers interest.Why Pot Boiler? From the ancient practice in the kitchen where the families food, was piled into a large pot on the stove. There wouldn't be much to go around, and what there was had to be made to last. As the contents were depleted extra ingredients, were added to keep it topped up. To keep the food cooking and ensure it doesn't, stick to the pot it was necessary to keep stirring it continually.Hence the term Pot Boiler to describe an essentially meagre story stretched to fit, with sufficient twists to keep viewers interested.For me this films tale keeps my wanting to know what happens next, without blowing my mind.There are enough plot twists to stop me nodding off, though it could probably benefit from some judicial pruning.It's not a film I will be revisiting any time soon and when I go back, on Netflix will doubtless remove from My List.The overall storyline for me represents the American System, which is owned and run by and in the interests of the rich and powerful.The Monroe family or more aptly Clan are all cut from the same cloth, they all share the same DNA $Money. They made it by being prepared to do whatever it took to get ahead, the very epitome of 'The American Way'.The go ahead politician William Monroe assiduously builds, a political persona of 'Honesty and Decency'. These are brandished as Campaign Slogans, while in reality he is an atypical American SoB.When asked what he would do, if he faced someone who could destroy his career. His answer was unambiguous to the nth degree, ""Pay him off or bump him off"".I paraphrase slightly but my point is that, American politicians are essentially hypocrites. All that interests and motivates them is to win, at any costs other than to themselves.The 'Heroine' of the piece Lauren Monroe proves that in the end when the chips, are really down she knows where her loyalties lay.When it came to saving the Monroe family reputation she never hesitated, from being just as big an SoB as the rest of the Clan.",Inheritance
18,kuarinofu,What a weird combination,5,7 July 2020,"Inheritance (2020) is a very basic thriller plot painfully stretched over almost 2 hours handled by the most dimwitted slasher-movie-meat characters you will ever see. Maybe it was even a slasher film repurposed as a thriller at some point.Every scene in this is as painful and slow as possible. Everything has to be discussed, even if it's completely irrelevant. The ending is disconnected from 80% of the stuff they set up in the film.The way it's shot it really feels like a video game cutscene, like a pre-mission GTA V dialogue where the characters discuss something they are about to do and then they just do it, but you still see and hear every line of dialogue, even if it serves no purpose whatsoever.By the time you fast-forward to the ending and they reveal the ""big twist"" that renders half of the film pointless, you won't probably care because you've seen this a million times (even though so many things in this make absolutely no sense).",Inheritance
19,JohnRayPeterson,"Excellent title; sometimes you inherit money, sometimes... a mess!",8,28 July 2020,"A classic type mystery drama with just the right development you'd expect from good novels. We are in a time of limited release of good movies; the pandemic has curtailed much of our supply of new good movies, but not completely. Inheritance is one of those. From the first scenes you start to form some expectation of nefarious actions the character Archie Monroe (played by Patrick Warburton, an actor with numerous roles to his credit and of tv commercial add fame) has likely committed, and in fact he did before he dies in the very early scene. But, you will not guess what he did until the director Vaughn Stein and screenwriter Matthew Kennedy have decided it was time for you to know; and the suspense thus starts to build. In fact some of the enthusiast viewers will even suspect Archie Monroe's death is itself suspicious, and of course that assumptions will prove to be true. We only see Patrick Warburton in a few scenes, that opening one and some flashback scenes well inserted to explain motives and background.The main characters, Lauren Monroe and Morgan Warner, respectively played by Lilly Collins and Simon Pegg, deliver flawless performances and Pegg is particularly good at portraying the evil 'Carson' a.k.a. 'Morgan', because for most of the movie we don't suspect him to be the cunning immoral criminal he turns out to be until we find out just how cunning, he is. I don't wish to spoil the plot anymore than I have already, but I must insist the development is a classic type mystery drama, which like all such work builds to a climax, not a disappointing one either. The character of Catherine Monroe, played by Connie Nielsen helps deliver that final climax, just when you have been wondering why a well known actor like Nielsen had such little screen time, up to that point.Other indispensable characters are William Monroe, son of Archie, Congressman and Lauren's brother, played by Chace Crawford, and Harold Thewlis, Archie's long time lawyer, played by Michael Beach. William conveys very well to Lauren the basics of family life of the rich and influential people, something which was a delight to see Collins learn. Beach also delivers just what was needed for the role and sparse as are the scenes he's in, they are crucial and Harold is just the classic trusted lawyer the Monroe family needed.Obviously I enjoyed the movie and I trust you will as well if you like mystery dramas.",Inheritance
20,MattyGibbs,Entertaining,7,18 October 2020,"A woman receives more than she bargained for after her father dies.This is a fairly uneven but nevertheless entertaining film. I'm glad I watched it before I read the reviews. Yes the plot is a bit silly but it keeps you guessing and watching. It's far from the car crash some reviewers have made out and if its one of the worst films you've seen then you haven't seen many.

21,Headturner1,what the heck spoilers,2,31 May 2020,Seroiusly. Horrible acting. No suspense and the whole thing so unbelievable! Yeah lock up a guy who supposedly rapes the mother and that's not really the reason it's because the dad hits a guy driving drunk and buries him. I fast forwarded thru the court scenes( they really don't add anything) and I figured a few minutes in he was her father. Tho also implausible because she couldn't have been 30. And the cheezy dialogue especially from the brother and the mother barely talks and when she does it's likes she's drugged up all the time. Pass on this . I've seen Simon Peg in a few things and he is a good actor. Why he took this roll is beyond me.,Inheritance
22,TheTruthofItIs,Should've been better,5,26 June 2020,"""Inheritance"" is a direct to video mystery with a mostly unknown cast except for an almost unrecognizable Simon Pegg. 31yo Lily Collins looks much younger, like she's from one of those kids shows on Disney or Nickelodeon. She's really out of place as big city DA ""Lauren Monroe"", so that's a casting fail, which is a problem since she's the lead. That and other plausibility problems take you out of important moments and make this a so-so storytelling when it could've and should've been worth an 8 or 9 rating. The whole production is analogous to doodoo covered with white icing - it looks good enough to eat but heaven help you if you do! For instance, the whole initial premise that her father barely if at all really briefed her on the terrible responsibility of her inheritance just because someone might be listening in is ludicrous. Fine, you can forgive that one maybe since it launches the story but it's followed by too many subsequent implausibilities you'd have to look past to really enjoy the story itself.

That was weird.The whole thing is just ridiculous still it's better than bad horror films or Lifetime movies so I gave this a 5.I feel bad that Simon went all in on this dud and it was all for naught.

The loyalty and nefarious elements a rich and powerful family didn't play well either as it was a stale point and retread of many other movies.

26,danielmanson,Far too many plot holes,5,10 October 2020,"I'll just jump right into it. There's too many plot holes. The premise is that the father dies and leaves behind in his inheritance this bloke who's been held captive for 30 years by him. The story is basically trying to find out who he is, why he is there etcBut the film is riddled with plot holes, when you're watching you are left with so many unanswered questions and confusion. For example (not a spoiler), the dad leaves a video in his will to the daughter saying he's got a secret and here's the key. Is that it? Is the bloke dangerous? What did he do? You not going to leave a bit more info considering he's been there 30 years.
The ending is really underwhelming as well. When you direct a film that's slow, you need a big ending. And this just didn't deliver at all. The ending also nulled a lot of the film out. I just wish this was done differently. The idea is great and unique, just done really badly. When the ""big reveal"" happens you are kind of just sat there going ""meh"".On the flip side I thought the acting was really good. Overall, I thought this was just a really average film. Good concept, but executed poorly. 5/10, worth watching? Probably not, but I've seen much worse",Inheritance

28,TwistedContent,Simon Pegg Entertains as the Movie Descends into Cliches and Silliness,5,22 May 2020,"""Inheritance"" - seemingly a lesser ""Parasite"" by trailer, with a poster oddly similar to ""Cloverfield"" films, and an anti-typecast Simon Pegg. Those were the first three thoughts occurring to me right before I strolled into the movie. The latter of them was one of their best sells, and anchors. Other than that, ""Inheritance"" certainly wishes to have substantial depth, nuance, and heavy social commentary, but the writing ultimately goes by-the-numbers and there's a certain level of silliness underneath the plot, present at all times.Lauren Monroe (Lily Collins) is a young, unbelievably successful district attorney chasing after Wall Street criminals, looking to atone for her family's wealth and shady moralities. The Monroe dynasty includes her younger brother William (Chace Crawford), a congressman who's somehow already running for the second term in office, very-little-meaning-possesing mother Katherine (Connie Nielsen), and egoistic, secretive millionaire father Archie (Patrick Warburton) whose death sets the movie in motion. Lauren often went against her father's wishes to do only what's good for the family, and now he posthumously offers her one last chance to change her mind. Second time director Vaughn Stein and first time writer Matthew Kennedy offer us their near-literalization of the expression ""skeleton in the closet"" as a prolonged, twisted joke.The ""skeleton"" is none other than Morgan Weaver, or Simon Pegg, with a wig of long silver hair and all the traumas decades without sunlight can provide. Pegg is the one aspect of ""Inheritance"" that truly entertains, putting on a gimmicky and formless performance that fits with the rather ungrounded and far-fetched premise of ""Inheritance"". Goes without saying though, performances were not among the bad parts of ""Inheritance"", and neither was the aesthetical side of things.Movie's main ideas revolve around Lauren's interactions with Morgan - in short, Morgan has everything everyone would need to annihilate the Monroe Dynasty, and Lauren is the walking talking dilemma of what's first, family or justice. Multiple other questions get tackled, like who's to blame for what in the webbed and tangled family hierarchy, and are we responsible for the sins of our ancestors.Through overkill reaching theatrics and rather cliché dialogues we dig for subtext only to find out the filmmakers have focused more on twists with capital T, shock value, and have forgotten to fulfill the philosophies so rather vaguely introduced throughout ""Inheritance"". Even in conflict and high strung sequences, screenplay provided a rather dry executions. It's actually the couple sweet, lovely moments of ""Inheritance"" that hit the notes more precisely. If only Stein and Kennedy had embraced to weirdness they had on their hands, it could've been a better movie. Instead, the script, as entertaining as it is, gives some characters muddled motivations and responses, goes for shocking more than thought provoking, ultimately starting to sink in clichés, inadvertently achieving a rather high predictability factor despite the fact that ""Inheritance"" appears to be relying a lot on twists and turns. It's 111 minute runtime includes pacing problems as well, most notably the second act, but the third one will probably be fan favorite, although at that point mostly destroyed subtextually, it allows for most action and most Pegg.Concepts at play in ""Inheritance"" pale in comparison with their better examples, like ""Parasite"", which many will probably call out when talking about ""Inheritance"". Guilty as charged myself. What could've been a nuanced, atmospheric and thoughtful drama, turned out to be an over-reaching thriller, resulting in a forgettable - except maybe for Simon Pegg - romp of half-realized and half-mangled potential. My rating: 5/10.",Inheritance

36,JurijFedorov,Incredibly stupid plot,5,24 October 2021,"This movie is actually okay good for the first hour and 20 minutes before anything is revealed. The tension is fine and you get drops of new info regularly so you keep watching. The acting is not ideal. It's okay at times. The brother is a great actor and all scenes with him are strong. The daughter and the prisoner are mediocre in this movie though. Not bad, but just cringe when they try to scream and shout and have monologue lines lasting several minutes. The girl largely cries and screams, but at the same time she is a super lawyer and a mom. So it's not quite clear why she is acting like a spoiled brat while supposedly having a serious job.The plot... oh man, once it's revealed it's just painfully stupid. I just can't even understand how stupid it is. It's just inexplicable that professional people read the script and the story and NOT A SINGLE PERSON said anything??? It's painfully cringe.The main thing is that it's a basic premise. A spoiled rich girl super lawyer finds out her father kept a mystery prisoner. She then interviews the prisoner to find out who he is. The plot twist is that it's a rapist who once raped her mother, so it's her real dad, not really a huge spoiler as it's completely clear from the start it's her dad. The family father imprisoned him for raping his wife. At some point she takes him out of the bunker to prove he knows where a body is buried. You assume the body has some relevance to the story, but it doesn't, if you remove it from the script nothing will change. Anyhow, this prisoner who is later revealed to be a psychopath does not try to escape as he is alone in the woods with her even though his hands are handcuffed on the front of his body. We see him fight her at the end of the movie so we know for sure he could very easily escape or overpower her in the woods or in the car with her. Yet he doesn't! And after that trip she locks him up in the bunker again. He just takes it. Even though she promised to free him once she checked out his story she didn't. Because she is a psychopath too? I'm not sure because the movie never makes this clear. At that point she is imprisoning a man she thinks is innocent and has been in a cell for 30 years. Even one extra day down there is true torture and if he turned out to be innocent I'd legit want her character to die in the movie for what she did.Keep in mind this prisoner/dad is only a rapist. He never did anything else. He just drugged and raped her mom. At the end she lets him fly to Cayman Islands with over a million in cash. So he can live in paradise and never work again. Or he could even sell his story to the papers. Instead he kills everyone on the plane and runs out to take his revenge on the family of the man who wronged him. Why did he do that? No one flying him out of the country knew who he was. He could have flown out and returned the next week. Or he could have just ran away from them. It's just a lawyer and 1 or 2 pilots on the plane with him. They would never have tried to stop him. And keep in mind they can't even call the cops because for all they know this innocent guy can reveal big secrets about the family and ruin them. So calling the cops would only hurt the family. The daughter and mom actually learned about his true identity while he was escaping the plane. The daughter wanted documents about his identity sent to her summer house. And the mom randomly visits her there and reads her letter and personal documents because... well, this is never explained. She just reads her mail. And we see that the bad guy is not who he says he is. The daughter could have waited for this letter and then freed him. But for some reason she decided to free him hours before getting the letter because she just... felt... she could trust him. Feelings over facts I guess. This is the same person who imprisoned him again after figuring out he was innocent as she ""needed time to think"". So why suddenly not even have patience to wait for the letter? Then the daughter drives to the airport and sees the dead bodies. Now, where is the mom you think? They learned at the summer house that this psychopath is on the loose and is likely coming to kill them all. She's of course all alone in the summer house where the bunker is. So even though she knows exactly what is coming she's just hanging out waiting for her killer. He arrives and overpowers them and then has a 5 minute long monologue with mediocre acting and they kill him. It's never quite clear why he is monologuing. He could just rape or kill them. Or even lock them up. Also, in the dark woods he didn't do anything to escape. Now he attacks the girl while she shoots at him. So not only can he easily overpower her, but he can even overpower and outtrick her while she has a gun. Why didn't he do this in the car or woods? The only reason is that the script writer needed him not to do it there. That's it.It's not a bad movie for 80% of it, the last 20% are just terrible and it's the whole plot, the twist. Why is this girl mom keeping him locked up instead of freeing him right away? Why didn't her dad warn her about the prisoner being a psychopath? Why does he suddenly become a super killer when we know he has never killed anyone before? Why didn't he plan his revenge? He plans a huge fake story to tell the girl to make her trust him. But at the end he freaks out and starts killing and shouting even though he had a million and plenty of time to plan a proper revenge where he wouldn't need to fight a girl with a gun. Also, the dad died as he stuck him with a needle with poison. Where did he get the poison from? To kill himself if he wanted to? Why did the dad let him keep it?I don't think the movie is horrible. It's not good, but it's fun for a long time. I can't really recommend it. But I do think it's way better than average. I don't regret watching it. I regret the script writer wrote it. If you really want to check it out then to it. For most part it's a fine thriller.",Inheritance

39,nebk,Might Get Disinherited,5,23 May 2020,"In Inheritance a young district attorney Lauren Moroe who comes from an extremely wealthy and influential family learns that her businessman mogul father had a dark secret locked away on the family property where he kept a prisoner named Morgan Warner chained below ground for 30 years. She decides to dig for the truth and find out why the man has been kept there longer than she has been alive before she makes up her mind as to whether she should release him or not. The consequences could be dire as releasing him could negatively impact her family and career as well as the family legacy. The reason behind that is the fact that Morgan knows where her father buried a man he accidentally killed 30 years ago.The performances by Lilly Collins as Lauren and Simon Pegg as Morgan are good but the movie's only likeable character is Morgan who morphs from a helpless and seemingly innocent prisoner into an evil psychopath upon his release. The rest of the cast is highly unlikeable for the most part. Lauren's brother is a corrupt politician, her father is an even more corrupt businessman, the family lawyer is also corrupt and her mother is just there basically to participate in the third act of the movie. Lauren's husband and daughter are also just there to complete the picture of a happy family and take up some screen time.Some of the actions by the characters make no sense. Morgan at one point has a chance to overpower Lauren and he doesn't do it while she is digging up the skeleton of her father's victim. Lauren asks a detective to find out anything he can about Morgan but then doesn't wait for the information before she releases him. The fact that she is a district attorney who finds a man chained up underground but doesn't call the police immediately also makes little sense as does her behaviour for the rest of the movie where she threatens a man without knowing much about him and constantly tells him she doesn't believe him and needs more proof. The fact her father left the burden of the whole situation on her shoulders without any explanation is also hard to believe as are some of the added story lines of the film.Overall this is not the worst movie out there and what redeems it somewhat are the performances by Pegg and Collins. The story however weakens toward the end and it's very difficult to believe the reasoning behind everything or the rushed ending which changes the tone of the film from a psychological suspense thriller to an action one. One other major problem is the jumbled up editing especially in the beginning where there are three different itervowen storylines which feel extremely rushed and cheapen the look of the movie from the start. Some extra care in the editing and the script could have made this much more suspenseful and engaging. A 4.5 out of 10 and that's on a good day.",Inheritance

You do that and miss the moral of the whole story. And this one clearly had a very good one. I think whether or not she didn't fit the role cause she liked young or whatever doesn't matter so long as the message was delivered. And I bet most giving the bad reviews all missed the moral.

41,tkarlmann,Very Good movie!,8,6 February 2021,"OK, I've seen this film three times now, and have enjoyed it very much.Perhaps 'enjoyment' is the incorrect term. I have an inexplicable crush on Connie Neilsen -- from her excellent portrayal in Gladiator, to her earlier films, where she was even more gorgeous -- if that's possible -- to this film.That aside, it's difficult to categorize this film -- it's nearly impossible to say: ""oh it's just like ..."" (Excluding ""Robinson Caruso"" and ""Papillon""). How does one come to grips with being imprisoned for 30 years? Well, I can answer that, I guess: I was an Electronics Engineer for that period of time -- and I got absolutely nothing out of it (working for others, of course) -- so I felt a weird kinship for Simon Pegg's character in this film -- although I don't wish anyone harm!Simon Pegg: I did not know this was him, until I began this review. Pegg's character is SO fantastic in the (new) Star Trek, that, after seeing this movie, my opinion of him went up about 10x (from an already high mark) from what it was.So there you have it: Actors (& Actresses), story, very good suspense -- what else do you need?

The twist was average.I didn't guess, but should have known this would ripoff a bit of Silence of the Lambs, Saw. And the bailout plot device? Tsk, tsk, writer and director. That was a clumsy cheat.The main business purpose of this moive seems to be so that Pegg can put ""psycho killer"" in his resume. He definitely displayed some acting prowess. It truly is a different Pegg, and I've seen almost everything he's done for decades, and like and respect him. But his portrayal gave me zero creeps. His american voice is decent enough. I suspect he could have benefitted from stronger direction from a director who had a more robust creative vision of what Pegg's character should be.Otherwise, this script needed a good rewrite.If you, like me, have a problem feeling sorry for a rich, powerful 'dynasty' family that's supposed to be the victim here, then you'll have a problem caring about anyone in the entire film.",Inheritance

Both Lily Collins and Simon Pegg do well in their roles, you see some very nice acting from both of them, but I couldn't help but feel Lily was too ""baby-faced"" to be believable as the DA of manhattan, and Simon, well it was just weird to see him in such a role to be honest, I found these two casting choices really distracting.But in spite of those two points, I still enjoyed it.

The story is about the secrets of an inheritance left behind when a powerful and wealthy member of a family dies. What killed this movie was how weak the suspense tone was because the events were as expected but even so it was still so captivating. I was always asking this question, ""what are you doing!"" there were so many moments that had me at that point and I was so engaged in the story. The beginning was too revealing they should have changed a small detail of not exposing the surroundings. What saved this movie with its predictability was the strong performance of Lily Collins.The cast was magnificent and the conversations between Lilly Collins and Simon Pegg were gripping. Simon Pegg is a great actor and watching him in this kind of role was refreshing. I would recommend heavily this film for Lilly Collins, what an unforgettable performance every decision she made and her desperation to know the truth caught my interest with such a strong presence. If one wants to know how good this female actor is, this would be the perfect movie to watch her true talents. Connie Nielsen her on-screen mother, has an intimidating presence and I wanted more scenes between them. This powerful family is interesting, even her on-screen brother Chace Crawford, the way they all protect each other made me yearn for more.I wasn't too impressed with the music, the composer Marlon Espino needed to amplify the intensity and he failed to do it in the climax although not all his music was bad, I loved his soft steady theme.",Inheritance

Why didnt he just live this to his wife who knew about him? And how come this prisoner knew everything about their family, did the father really talked to him like he is his friend? Really?

Secondly, the daughter as DA, she tries to look serious in the usual way, wearing glasses when she appears in court, and we are supposed to believe she is smart. She is married to a black guy which must have bugged her pop because he only leaves her 1 million as opposed to the congressman son who gets 20 million.

Or, even more aptly, maybe ""Secrets, Lies, and Panic Attacks""...That said, I found it to still be a good movie. I've been tracking it recently, because I can't remember the last time I saw Lily Collins in an action movie; let alone a thriller. Though her character is written rather poorly, she does get to play a young woman with a real law career. This might deter audiences who are used to seeing her in her 'usual' peppy rom-com role, but I think Collins does a great job carrying the movie, along with Simon Pegg who plays the mysterious man locked in the creepy family cellar.
All in all, I found it refreshing to see her in little bit of a heavier role.Now, the writing and direction itself was a little silly: There's a scene involving a mask (that's all I'll say) that had me rolling my eyes. The first act of the movie does meander and the pacing is off. If the twist/climax had taken off just a little earlier on, it would make for a better movie. I'd say a good 80% of the film involves only Lauren (Collins) and Morgan (Pegg) and they really are doing good work. The twist leading up to the conclusion was a nice addition...again, if only they had planted it a little earlier!",Inheritance

Connie Nielsen and Chace Crawford were given no chance to shine whatsoever - and could, for all intents and purposes - have been replaced with a few lines of dialogue spoken by Lily Collins. The ending was simply terrible - in line with the abominable '...And I awoke and realised it was all a dream.'

The movie starts and we see Archer Monroe (played by Patrick Warburton), having some sort of seizure as he tries to leave his house in his car. Archer is a very powerful and wealthy man, who has a son, William (played by Chace Crawford), who is a politician running for reelection, and a daughter, Lauren (played by Lily Collins), who is a Manhattan District Attorney. The seizure ends up making Archer have an accident in the car in which he died after he hit a tree. As the family mourn his death at the family home after the funeral, the will is read, which leaves most of the estate to William, and leaving Lauren a million dollars, but after this the family attorney, and close friend of Archer's,Harold Thewlis (played by Michael Beach), finds Lauren to give her a package that her father had left in his possession until his death. Lauren then opens the package that reveals a flash drive in a wooden box. Lauren goes into a quiet place in the house to find out what could be on this drive. When she opens it, it is a prerecorded video from Archer. Archer had a secret, maybe more than one, but this particular secret he had kept from everyone, even his wife Catherine (played by Connie Nielsen). As he is now dead, he had to pass this on to someone. That someone is Lauren. Within this secret, it will test her morals, her loyalty and her humanity.
I really did enjoy the tense moments in this film, one of the stars is Simon Pegg. I haven't mentioned him above as i may give away a spoiler, which i do not want to do. I thought that Simon Pegg was very very good, and seems to get better and better, and Lily Collins was excellent in her role as Lauren, as she deals with her ""Inheritance"". I thought the story had a good story-line with the suspense and mystery we all love in a thriller.

This movie is the kind that you'd find yourself enjoy it more IF you can ignore the plot holes. Picture tom & jerry's holey cheese, those are the exact representation of the plot holes. So thats what I did, I ignore them and enjoy the performance. Well but then again there's only so much that mr.Pegg can do.
This movie HAD a potential to become better, but the choppy edit and poor conclusion at the end render this movie into a meh.And as for lily collins, she gave great performance here, its solid. I just... cant helped but feel that someone else would've suited more to be the lead role. She didn't have the charisma nor the tenacity that was needed to play the no nonsense District Attorney.I like the first 50minutes of this movie, the revelation at the end just felt forced and rushed, all that build up doesn't really paid well.

It's not the kind of role she used to play, but she really brought out some hidden aspects of the character and kept the emotional flow at the surface. For her performance only, I think an 8 or 9 is not unreasonable.Now in my opinion, the major problem of the movie is it kinda played fast and loose with the back story of the character Carson. The reveal of his true identity is supposed to be the highlight and climax of the movie.

128,gtmarcyk,Young and foolish for a reason,7,26 August 2021,"When I first starting watching Inheritance, my first impression was the director made a terrible choice in selecting Lily Collins as the lead. Ms Collins is just over 30 years old and looks to be in her 20s. There is just no way that a woman this young could be a DA for New York City. Then she makes naïve and foolish choices when dealing with her family secret.But upon reflection, I realize that Ms Collins was chosen BECAUSE she is too young. There was no way that she could have ever risen so high and so fast into this office without her wealthy father paying off people along the way. All without her knowledge. Likewise, her younger brother (perhaps at age 28) is running for his second term in Congress. This means that he would have been first elected as one of the youngest members of Congress in modern history. Again, implausible unless the wealthy dad was buying influence every step along the way. In contrast, the brother knew about the money and it was part of his re-election strategy.Simon Peg was almost unrecognizable in his role as the family secret. Yes, he overplayed his role but that was a deliberate strategy to gain the sympathy of the lead character. As yes, he was more than a little crazed at the end but that behavior was not unbelievable for someone under his circumstances.The big plot hole is why the egotistical and ruthless father would chose to keep this secret for 30 years. Why take this chance unless the father was addicted to risky behavior and having absolute control over other people? This should have been explored more.The other implausible thing was Simon Pegg's suit. How in earth did he get a perfectly fitting designer suit under the circumstances?",Inheritance

I genuinely suspect that the music score was simply downloaded from Spotify.The people who made this movie couldn't even be bothered to get the tiny details correct. Have you ever tried to eat a steak with a plastic knife and fork? What about TRYING TO EAT A *WELL-DONE* STEAK WITH A PLASTIC KNIFE AND FORK? Not easy, is it? But eating a WELL-DONE STEAK with a plastic knife and fork is easy in this movie. Have you ever played chess? The characters in this movie have been playing chess regularly for years, but during an ""intense"" scene, they leave their chess pieces open to attacks Forrest Gump would have seen coming a mile away. Have you ever inherited something from someone recently deceased? Did you and all of the other inheritors sit in a room together for the ""reading of the will""? No, you didn't. Because that's just a stupid movie trope that doesn't exist in real life. But alas, it happens in this movie.Literally, everything in this movie is poorly conceived and poorly executed. And the worst thing about Inheritance, is that everything in this movie stretches the suspension of disbelief to such an extent, that Simon Pegg, who seems like he genuinely made an effort, comes-off as over-acting and hammy in comparison to the dreadful quality of the rest of the film. Every scene featuring Simon Pegg withdraws the viewer from the viewing-experience because the viewer suddenly finds him or herself wondering, ""why is Simon Pegg trying so hard in this dreck of a film?""Are you familiar with the 'made-for-cable' movies you see listed as you're scrolling through the cable guide channel, and you roll your eyes as you scroll past them and read their ridiculous titles, like, ""Mommy, Is It Okay That I Married My Stepfather?"", and you think to yourself, ""who watches this junk enough that they keep making these cheesy, terrible, 'made-for-cable' movies?"". Inheritance lies about the middle of the quality-spectrum of cheesy, terrible, 'made-for-cable' movies.",Inheritance
132,drummer303,Extremely poor and very silly,1,12 October 2020,Utter utter rubbish of the highest order. Acting is beyond wooden. Plot is incredibly stupid. Believability factor of zero.

Lily is supposedly the DA for Manhattan, yet there is no evidence of her ability for deductive reasoning or keeping her cool in the face of a challenge. No ability to be objective and question things accordingly. She is weak, overly emotional and can't make an intelligent decision to save her life. So...DA for Manhattan? Yeah, right. Oh, and why keep that guy alive? And why hand over such a deep dark secret with no information? Why make it a mystery if she's supposed to carry on the secrecy? If the truth is to ""stay buried"" then why keep the evidence alive and then not give her the information she would need to manage through it?

Yes, Lilly Collins looks way too young yada yada yada but the acting was good and that is all I need. So, casting aside...
Was the plot hard to believe? Yes. Has it been done before? Well, yes, see ""Castle Rock"" etc. But was it a bad movie? H to the ell no! The acting I liked. The suspense was good. The twist was good whether you saw it coming or not. I felt for the characters even though I shouldn't have. Made me question my own morals and that, my friends, is a good movie to me.

149,crashdavis18,"awwwww, c'mon",3,21 June 2020,"Listen, I love, ... LOVE Simon Pegg. Hot Fuzz is one of my favourite movies ever. He is an amazing writer. If I ever met him, I would tell him so. I would complement him on that movie, Shawn of the Dead, his contributions to Star Trek. So much more.As an actor, he is also good. His acting is fine in this movie. Lily Collins is also fine. That is why it pains me to say that this movie is terrible.Acting aside, there is not an alternate universe ever to be able to conceive of where Collins is THE district attorney for NYC. I don't care how much money daddy poured into her campaign or how much corruption was involved.More importantly, this script is simply terrible. IF, ... IF Collins was smart enough to actually run the DA's office, her choices throughout the movie are idiotic, and not just idiotic in a Friday the 13th - don't do that - sort of way. Leave aside that no lawyer ever called to the bar would run a major trial in the manner that she does (bring me up to speed on the important stuff, 2 seconds before the judge walks into the room).If one can suspend disbelief long enough to accept that she would delay immediately freeing a man for whom she would otherwise spend the rest of her life in jail, in order to make inquiries into who he was and why he was there, then no rational person could possibly accept that she would free him without obtaining the results of her inquiries.So, if I ever was sitting down and having a beer with Simon Pegg, I would still be in awe of his many unbelievable accomplishments. I would ask him about those. I would never have the balls to discuss this movie with him. Maybe, even as an amazing writer, across so many genres, it is still difficult to assess how a script will play out as an actual movie. I wouldn't know, no one will ever offer me a role in a movie.On the other hand, oh. my. god. This script is awful.",Inheritance

As a DA you would think she could withstand the darker side of humanity, but she seemed to have little fortitude of any kind. She regularly walked through scenes gasping for air, with that corny furrowed brow that you usually see in teen horrors as the unwitting tiptoe through the graveyard.
Predictable, with shallow characters and a plot that made you wonder who you were rooting for. I just wanted it to be over, I didn't care who won in the end - they were ALL monsters!

She has neither the character or frankly, the years to pull it off. Shortly thereafter we learn that Simon Pegg has been cast as the villain, whose implicit malevolence and intensity is central to whether this film has any credibility. One might say it's therefore quite predictable that when you cast a mild mannered actor whose spent the vast majority of his career doing comedic roles, that they will be woefully unsuited to this part.From the moment the first interaction between these two unbelievable characters ends, you know that the film is going to be a damp squib at best, and you can only pray for a mercifully swift ending... which you don't get.",Inheritance

Just to get to the end to find out he raped a woman and helped bury a body. Terrible crimes but a few years in prison would have been justified for that.That leads me to believe that the father was the sadistic psychopath in all this, locking up a man in a dark room chained up for 30 years, torturing him with a single piece of chocolate, turning all the lights off when he leaves the room..? Then sending his daughter in blindly to deal with such a potentially dangerous situation?

The best way to describe the film is with an equation:""Succession"" (""Parasite"" x ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""/""Shallow Grave"") = ""Inheritance.""Whether or not the math quite works out, these are the references that burble to the surface while watching Stein's family drama of money and secrets long buried.What the math does prove is that ""Inheritance, can't deny its horror/thriller DNA. Though the twists and turns are rather schlocky, the cast elevates the material, especially Collins, who is 110% committed to the role. She stars as Lauren Monroe, a district attorney and eldest daughter of a wealthy money man, Archer (Patrick Warburton), who suddenly passes away at the height of one of her most high-profile cases, and during the congressional race of her brother William (Chace Crawford).Though the setting of ""Inheritance"" suggests prestige, this is really just a B-movie all dressed up in a suit, and the sooner the audience realizes that the better, because it's certainly never uninteresting, and at times, even fun.",Inheritance

Yes, it was very gripping and the plot twists were well handled, but the whole concept was pretty distasteful, and personally I would have rated it an 18 rather than a 15 due to the violence and bad language.
Simon Pegg is very good; Lily Collins is a good actress, but sadly miscast - as other reviews have mentioned, she looks like a high-school student, and we're supposed to believe she's a DA with a daughter who looks about 8 or 9.
The plot does have some serious holes in it, but the main thing that put us off was the complete lack of moral fibre in the main characters and the whole premise of the situation. The main characters are beyond humanly flawed, and we ended up just feeling dirty having watched this.

The casting was bit odd (Lily Collins is the D.A. in a large city at that age) come on guys what were you thinking.And now the plot, well what can I say. it's Matthew Kennedy's first screen-play (as-far-as I know) so I have to say it was quite good for first-timer. Well-Done.But the plot isn't flawless. I can accept the non-logical events as long as it sustains its own logic in the world that it was created in. The plot has loose-ends especially near the ending. they spend lot of time developing Morgan (Simon Pegg) character to be such a smart character that can anticipate what could happen 10 moves ahead, and yet he forgets the gun and left it on the ground, on the top of that ""Catherine"" (Connie Nielsen) finds the gun from no-where (considering that she was unconscious at the time of ""gun-fight"") that bit destroyed the whole movie for me.

The premise of the film is very outlandish, which in itself isn't a con, but there's just a lot of stuff that doesn't make much senseAgain, mostly at the start of the film, but, character motivations don't seem to line up with their actionsDisappointing anticlimactic ending that doesn't really feel like we gotten anywhereIt's an average film for me all in all and wouldn't recommend you seek this one out.

Why tell the daughter a secret is buried which she must take to her grave. Why didn't the dead dad just take it to his grave. What did he expect would happen with a vague message, she would find him and what? Continue to keep him there with no other explanation. If honestly defies any logic. No one would do this. And FINALLY, why get finger prints, ask someone to run them and let him go before you get the results.

How does a viewer suspend her/his disbelief which is essential to absorb the story? What does a person live on for thirty years locked up? How does he dispose of his waste? How does he not go raving mad? These questions are never answered. Tucking into a steak after years of eating substitute food his body would rebel, yet this captive behaves as if he had eaten steak every day or at least ever week. A big, strong man why doesn't he overpower his tiny captor? So many questions to answer.

220,alexomara,Covid has a lot to answer for to make this trend on netflix,1,17 October 2020,The only interesting part of this film was the initial premise and wondering what the twist might be. In the end the twist is the spiral into unintelligent boredom. The only suprise from the big reveal is that it's playing out with nothing happening. No twist no sense no plausible human interaction. Bad films can be fun but they have the decency of letting you know what your in for. This has an interesting premise and I was sure there would be some great cat and mouse set plays especially with the dramatic irony of the chess lessons but this felt like 2 directors settling a bet. The first director has bet the second that he can make a second half of a film so unplausible boring and obvious that there is no way that the second director can produce a first half that will make the audience put up with it. We'll well done both of you I hope your proud of yourselves.,Inheritance

222,Capz8,Masterpiece,8,19 October 2020,"I am really surprised at how many bad reviews this film has got. This was an absolute joy to watch. Simon Pegg, who I'm used to seeing him in comedy films, I actually disliked him as an actor, but this film changed my mind on him completely. His acting in this movie was incredible. To switch from comedian to a villian is very difficult and he mastered it. Not forgetting I need to give credit to the female actress who was absolutely incredible as well. Their conversations was realistic.The storyline is unique and gripping. This takes you back to 90's, to the best Thrillers era. I did have an inkling at the start, but as the movie went on, I thought ""Nahhhhh"". This film questions your morals and triggers it in different ways.As for the bad reviews you guys really don't appreciate a good movie! The hard work is clearly visible so to rubbish this movie would be an insult.It would be a 10 if the storyline wasn't so drawn out with a quick finish but I like a long movie and I was satisfied!Most movies nowadays, you're left with a lot of unanswered questions.

Lilly Collins was really good in this movie. She's a DA who believes in justice but has the conflicts of her wealthy privileged family who are ruthless when it comes to protecting the family. Her acting was superb. Simon Pegg who I've been a fan of for many years was unrecognizable in this role. His voice gave me the creeps. I never knew he had this in him and that made the movie all the better for me. He was fantastic.

How can two big/tall parents have such a small and frail (non sick) child ?I agree that Lily Collins lacked a bit of charisma to be the New-York DA but lets skip that.My overall grief is the sens of time, the lightless bunker should have given a sense of passing time (or not passing), when was day or night, during how many days the events took place (i'm still unsure).It was far too slow until the twist that was far too quick, loosely tied up and almost felt like an afterthought.and she find the entrance of that bunker far too quickly !",Inheritance

240,KryptonDeer,Implausible exposition and plot that ends with no absolution.,4,26 October 2020,"The film's implausible exposition and plot have severely impeded me from enjoying the otherwise fine acting by Lily Collins and Simon Pegg.After Catherine was raped by Morgan, Archer kept Morgan in captivity, tortured him but didn't kill him. Archer prepared a video for his daughter (actually Morgan's daughter from the rape) to explain this situation in case of untimely death, but chose to not explain anything in the video. Not mentioning Morgan at all, not the rape, not that Morgan is her biological father, not nothing. If the video was taken with Archer's last breath, maybe. Inheritance chose the worst way to set the story in motion.I can understand Lauren playing along with Morgan due to her protecting her family going into the situation completely dark. But Morgan, knowing Lauren is her daughter, acted in the weirdest way introducing her to Archer's mistress and car accident without getting to the truth. All the subplots go NOWHERE and that is frustrating - nowhere from mistress and the love child, nowhere from Lauren's brother re-election campaign, nowhere from Lauren's husband and daughter, no where from Lauren's detective friend.I had hoped that the film will start exploring Lauren's difference from her father (protecting his power and rich friends) and her brother (bribing and nothing off the table) and eventually bring Morgan to the daylight. But no, Morgan goes on a killing spree as expected, intends to lock his biological daughter in the hellhole and then Catherine simply shot him to death...no absolution, no message, the end. The suspense is there, but Inheritance is ultimately an unfulfilling experience.",Inheritance
