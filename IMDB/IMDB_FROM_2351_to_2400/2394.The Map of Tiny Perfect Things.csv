0,kosmasp,Perfect day (?),6,26 August 2021,"Is there such a thing? Well I guess if you have infinite tries you can make it happen ... but would it remain perfect? As in could you catch lightining in a bottle over and over again? Wouldn't that become boring? As concept that is of course.All the movies that handle a theme like this (Groundhog Day is best known, but as the characters here also note you also have Edge of Tomorrow), are telling us something ... about life, about repetition, about morals and other things. Having said that, it will depend on how much slack you are willing to cut a movie. Now this right here starts immeditately with the knowledge of the main character. You are thrown into the mix and you will learn quickly what he already knows .... what he already does. How he is ""perfecting"" his and other peoples day. Knowing what happens, makes him predict things obviously and therefor he can ""save"" people from certain things happening to them.Overall a decent effort and depending on your feelings towards the two main characters you may like this a bit more or less than I did.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
1,CinemaSerf,Better than average teen movie...,6,13 February 2021,"OK, so we, too, have seen it all before - but this features quite an engaging effort from Kyle Allen ""Mark"", who repeats the same day over and over with his family. He encounters ""Margaret' (Katheryn Newton) who is also suffering from the same repetitive scenario and they realise that nothing they do will not be undone next day, and so have some fun together. Of course, they begin to fall in love but she has reservations; steals away every day at the same time and despite his best efforts - and a cleverly concocted map depicting their daily routines - it looks like they are doomed to this groundhog day existence for ever.... What can break their curse? Both the leads are easy on the eye; Allen looks like he might have a musical theatre background as his movements are frequently quite rhythmically synchronised and the pair take this rehashed theme along for about 45 minutes well enough, before it, too, begins to recycle itself. It's young person's film with cute stars. a little bit of chemistry and a modicum of gentle humour as they try to escape their circle of life. It won't be a film we will watch or remember a year from now, probably, but for now it's a perfectly watchable family television feature.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
2,deloudelouvain,"Tweeners reliving the same day over and over, sounds like déjà-vu.",6,29 August 2021,"Another movie with the same theme as Groundhog Day. I don't know how much more movies they can make with people stuck in a time loop, reliving the same day over and over. The story is of course a tiny bit different but still at one point enough is enough. I gave it a six because my wife liked it more than I did. To me a five star rating would have been more accurate. The movie just gets boring after awhile. I guess the audience they were looking for are tweeners. The classic cheesy romcom, I can't say it's really my thing. There's certainly not enough comedy for me to make me laugh. The acting wasn't bad but nothing special either. I will forget everything about this movie in a couple days, in fact I already start forgetting about it.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
3,Cineanalyst,Kiss of Death,4,24 February 2021,"There comes a time, I suppose, when all popular and good ideas are ruined by the replacement with teenage characters or the transference to so-called young adult fiction. Romance, of course, apocalyptic and political thrillers, sci-fi, vampires and werewolves, even socially-conscious message movies and time-travel scenarios, or both (""See You Yesterday"" (2019)). As opposed to the ""Back to the Future"" (1985) variety of manipulating the space time continuum, ""The Map of Tiny Perfect Things"" deals in the ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) style of the time loop. How timely, I guess, given that we've already had ""12 Dates of Christmas"" (2011), ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014), part of ""Doctor Strange"" (2016), ""Naked"" (2017), ""Happy Death Day"" (2017) and its sequel, the ""Russian Doll"" series, ""Palm Springs"" (2020) and the upcoming ""Boss Level"" (2021), etc. Live, die, repeat, indeed.Oh, I'm not complaining so much about the repetitiveness of the time-loop genre, which I think is loaded with, if not necessarily infinite, manifold interesting possibilities. ""Groundhog Day"" is an all-time great film, and ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" ""Happy Death Day,"" ""Russian Doll"" and ""Palm Springs,"" at least, each do some different and neat things with the similar scenario. Apart from cinematic and video-game reflexivity, genre twists and philosophical musings, the loop is a wonderful fantasy. The rules vary, but like in this one, it offers immortality. Even if one fancies themselves too good to go god-mode Grand Theft Auto on their no-consequences repeated surroundings, you have the potential for unlimited acquirement of skills and knowledge and for self-betterment. Why would I not want to spend at least a very, very long time in that.To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw or someone I haven't had time to thoroughly read, time travel is wasted on the young. All they do is play the same video game, watch only one film (""Time Bandits"" (1981)), drive the same vehicles, see the same supposedly-magical ""tiny perfect things,"" repeat playing Good Samaritans to slack-jawed amazement, and try to get a kiss. If that is all you're getting from life, yeah, maybe I see why they'd want to get on with it until its inevitable end. It's rather apt, though, how the mystery of the mystery girl plays into this kiss-of-death proposition. Yet, it's still the stupid lecturing to kids on how to deal with emotionally-difficult subjects (death in this case), and it's supposedly ""her story"" as predominantly told from his perspective. I doubt I'll give this one any repeat viewings, but let me know when the second ""Edge of Tomorrow"" or another ""Happy Death Day"" sequel is released.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
4,A_Different_Drummer,Way too easy to overlook!,7,14 February 2021,"First of all Lev Grossman is the genius behind MAGICIANS so you want to think twice before doing a driveby on this one. Second, Kyle Allen steals every scene he is in and has a heck of a career ahead. Third. the film suffers from a rare affliction (mentioned in some of my other reviews) wherein the opening Act (the first 20 mins in this case) is MUCH better than the rest of the movie. Which is not to say the rest of the movie is bad -- far from it -- merely that the opening makes a promise which is never kept. And that can annoy the viewer, even on a subliminal basis. Good solid film.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

6,UniqueParticle,Temporal anomaly stories are so good!,10,11 October 2021,Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton are magnificent together very charming couple. I absolutely love the soundtrack it's so delightful! This is one of the best Amazon films they released I should've watched sooner. It's great to see a heartwarming timeloop story that doesn't have action or chaos although I must say most are well written especially the theories I crave those.,The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
7,cruise01,Enjoyable romantic sci fi drama that has familiar concepts but meaning.,7,14 February 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is a pretty fair film. Having a similiar concept of Groundhog Day or Edge of Tomorrow where characters repeat the same day over and over. Mark (Kyle Allen) is an ordinary teen. Repeating the same day. Avoiding the talk with his father about his future. Avoiding in taking in interest with his father and sister. He seems to know the town well after repeating everything. Until he meets Margaret (Kathryn Newton) who is the other person repeating the same day with him. She seems to be avoiding something and does not mind doing the same day over. While the two have fun and trying to find clues to why they are stuck in a time loop.The plot is pretty decent. Two characters stuck in a time loop. While the film does have fun for the first hour or so with them doing anything without having to worry about people remembering the next day. It does lose itself in the second hour when Mark is trying to get with Margaret.The cast is great. Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton are good with there roles. The film plays with familiar concepts from other films. Even like Palm Springs film. But the direction does lose its fun tone when the romance story does feel dull. The story does have a little meaning behind it. About living your life.,The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
8,matthewssilverhammer,One of the Best Teen Rom-Coms in Years,8,10 May 2021,"There's a vast chasm of difference between good & bad versions of these twee-teen indie dramedies. But when they work, I'm such a sucker for them...& this one WOOORKS. Typically, the teens talking with brains beyond their years, using words straight out of the thesaurus, is insufferable; however, the premise not only allows for it but makes it funny & charming. It's a delightful & lovely rom-com about grief, loss, kindness, & perspective that doesn't rely on cheap shortcuts to manipulate us into liking it.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

He comes to realise that there is also a girl experiencing the same time loop as him (Newton) and they get together - she though needs to leave him every evening, the reason for which is unclear.Pleasant enough romance with a Groundhog Day twist, although I'm not sure the rules of time loops are strictly adhered to here as so much appears to change each day.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
10,yusufpiskin,Amazon Prime Marathon,7,23 February 2021,"""I thought it was a love story and I was the hero, but wasn't about me. It wasn't my story at all.""
I love Akiva Goldsman's movies
that's just a great movie. Wonderful screenplay. Super charming leads. It's fun and sincere and warm. The scene when Mark finally goes to his sister's soccer game and she scores because he's there is such effective screenwriting and it completely sold me on the whole movie and I definitely cried a bit.The pool of time loop movies isn't that huge yet (hopefully it keeps expanding because I love these movies and there are so many ways filmmakers could still tweak the formula or subvert it), so the competition isn't incredibly stiff, but this is right up at the top of the list for me.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
11,masonfisk,BEEN THERE...DONE THAT...& REPEAT...!,6,28 April 2021,"A recent Amazon Prime release starring Kyle Allen & Kathryn Newton (from Freaky) which borrows heavily from Groundhog's Day & Edge of Tomorrow (which both get name-checked here by our hero). We have Allen (soon to be seen in Spielberg's West Side Story remake) wakes up to a normal day on the surface but as he inexplicably walks through town anticipating events as if he were a seer (he continually saves a girl from being hit by a beach ball at the town's pool) but when he notices Newton (someone who up to this point has never run into), his interest is peaked. Following Newton forces him to broker a conversation w/her which blossoms into a tentative romance, even though at a certain time every day she needs to be somewhere leaving Allen scratching his head but when he finally finds out Newton's secret (a family member is about to pass from cancer), all the pieces fall into place. If it weren't for Groundhog's Day, the granddaddy of all these type of films (Happy Death Day & it's sequel count as well), this version would be revolutionary, novel even but since its basking in the sun of its large shouldered predecessor, this gets a pass, more for the winsome, likeable leads then for the story itself. Also starring perennial father on screen these days, Josh Hamilton, as Allen's dad, comedian Al Madrigal as a science teacher & Jorja Fox, from the original CSI, as Newton's mom.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
12,rannynm,"Heart-warming teenage love story, a time loop with repeated do-overs",8,12 February 2021,"The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is a fun film with amazing stunts, a heart-warming teenage love story, a time loop and even a really cool 4-D cube drawing! The idea in this story of having infinite do-overs to create the perfect day is fascinating. Putting it all together, this film is a great combination of action, light romance, adventure, and comedy.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things features Mark (Kyle Allen) who gets stuck in a time loop and is living the same day over and over again. Every night at midnight, he falls asleep and wakes up with the previous day starting over again. In the mist of the time loop, one day he meets a mysterious girl named Margaret (Kathryn Newton) who is stuck in the same time loop. They end up on an adventure all around the city finding the ""tiny things"" that make up that one perfect day, while trying to decide if and how to break the time loop.I enjoyed watching Mark and Margaret's friendship develop and all the wild things they do without suffering consequences since they are in the time loop, like drive a tractor down the street. My favorite part is when they completely trash a model home, knowing the time loop would put it back the way it was. Another part I love is when Mark shows his dad the tattoo he got. It's funny because he shows it to his dad right before he goes back into the time loop so his dad won't remember. The Map of Tiny Perfect Things has some really great stunts in it, too. One stunt I thought was cool was when Mark throws his water bottle at a closing door and makes it through!The message of this film is that sometimes the most perfect things in life may be the smallest things. One great lesson Mark's character shows is how to care about others. I loved seeing him remember all the ways he can help people in his town each day and spread kindness. A couple of things adults should look out for in this film include places with Margaret drinking and mild cursing.
I rate The Map of Tiny Perfect Things 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 years old. Adults will like it, too.Reviewed by Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
13,Kamurai25,"""The Perfect Day, Again""",8,5 June 2021,"Great watch, would watch again, and do recommend.After seeing ""Palm Springs"" and ""Happy Death Day(s)"" take such silly (and murderous) approaches to a time loop it is sort of relieving to see a sweet sort of more serious love story.I really liked that they took the introspective aspect of a time loop story and pointed out into the world, exploring what it is that makes their town and trying to find the ""perfect"" moments of their day.We'd be lucky to get to experience these sort of moments once a day, but the ridiculous level that they run this to is great, and it is funny without being silly.If you like the concept of a time loop, and/or a good, if potentially heavy, love story, then definitely give this a shot.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

There is resurgence in timeloop stories since the Happy Death Day and we're getting some great movies out of it. Palms Springs was excellent and Tiny Perfect Things holds on it's own too due to very charming Kyle Allen and Kathryn Newton.The movie takes little time to take off, but you can see the effort and heart put into the film from very first scene.

15,leftbanker-1,"Nothing Special, But What is These Days?",6,15 February 2021,"Movies and TV are mostly just plain horrible, so a perfectly OK film is like a masterpiece in comparison. This is a messed-up way to look at the world, but welcome to lock-down where I have more time on my hands than these two teens.This began with promise, so much that I stopped and tracked down the short story it's based on. The story wasn't much and seemed so self-conscious about stealing the idea from the movie Groundhog Day that it never really took on a life of its own-this is also the problem with the film.It tries to be sweet, and for that I rank it higher than I normally would, but it just doesn't have a lot going for it.I'm not really sure about the lead actress and why she wasn't right in this. Usually I blame bad acting on the director, but I'm not sure it was bad acting or just her terrible hair. Either way, it she didn't fit, not for me. The kid wasn't much better. There were no decent secondary roles. They tried to pump up his little sister at the end but it was too little, too late.Whatever, this was far better that the 50 super-violent movies dumped on the public last week.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

17,kevin c,Groundhog (lockdown) Day,5,17 February 2021,"Movie afternoon with Gertie.A re-run of 'Groundhog Day' for pandemically bored tweenagers. The film starts with a bravura opening sequence. Something falls, he's there to catch it; someone falls in the swimming pool, he's there to catch them. What kind of superhero is this kid? It's a brightly shot, terrifically edited introduction, although Allen's smug confidence begins to grate quickly.The film eventually switches things up by bringing on Margaret, who is uninterested in Mark, but in the same temporal freeze. Newton brings an engaging honesty to the super-smart Margaret, and at times Grossman's dialogue is sharp. This is glossy and undemanding, and perfect froa

21,sweidman-28016,Nothing New Here,6,2 March 2021,"""We're the ones sleeping. Everyone else is awake, and it's just us dreaming. I know it's going to hurt really bad. But I think that I have to wake up now.""The Map of Tiny Perfect Things follows a teenager contentedly living the same day in an endless loop who gets his world turned upside-down when he meets a girl who's also stuck in the time warp. What follows is a love story with a fantastical twist, as the two struggle to figure out how and whether to escape their never ending day. I didn't realize this was a time-loop movie when I put it on. A few minutes in there's one of those classic scenarios where the character is mimicking and moving around the setting well. Palm Springs did this well last summer. I kind of groaned at the fact that this is another one of those movies, but it didn't disappoint me in anyway. Surprisingly, I found myself entertained and liking some of it. The style is fun. The way it's presented hooked me in. Kyle Allen as the leading guy is a good casting choice here. Since this is geared towards teens, everyone has this fun nature. Kathryn Newton has been appearing in many things lately. I like her as an actress and she does well here. The two work well together. The romance element is bound to happen from the beginning and I guess it worked here. With all the charming moments, these two use the best qualities of themselves and characters to make an enjoyable time. It is an entertaining watch.Obviously, we've seen so many of these types of movies that it does become redundant. The movie thinks it's smarter than it actually is with the direction it takes. Kathryn Newton's character, for example, has a secret that she's trying to hide. When it's actually revealed, there's nothing new here and it feels forced. A good portion of the script feels forced. The runtime overstays it's welcome. At one point I thought it was getting close to the third act, but I wasn't even halfway done. There's so much it's trying to accomplish but it really needed to go a simpler route. The movie is still entertaining and fun at times but it also feels way too familiar making it average. I can't say too much about The Map of Tiny Perfect Things. Usually I don't take a liking to this kind of movie but it's charming enough watch for some to enjoy.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
22,ethanbresnett,Brilliant!,8,7 May 2021,"The whole time loop genre is right up my street. From Edge of Tomorrow to Palm Springs, if it has a time loop I'll watch it no questions asked. That being said I wasn't necessarily expecting much from The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, as it has middling reviews and seemed to be flying under the radar in terms of internet chatter, but boy was I surprised.This movie is such a joy to watch. It just does pretty much everything right, from the characters, the style, the direction, the script, the plot, the soundtrack. Just beautiful.Kathryn Newton was incredible as Margaret, and had great chemistry with Kyle Allen. Both of their characters were well thought out and were played to perfection. Their interactions always felt real and both of them felt lived in and relatable.In terms of the plot, it really was quite special. It had some great messages in there, from taking a moment to stop and appreciate life, to learning to move on and live life. It explored all of its themes in quite profound ways at times, through effective comedy and tender emotional moments.There's lots to digest with this film, as we jump between different genres. We sort of get teen romance, a bit of sci-fi, comedy, coming of age drama, and tragedy all in the space of an hour and a half.On top of all of this the film just has such a great vibe. It's a hard one to explain, but when you finish this film you will just sort of feel content and warm.Fantastic.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

24,nammage,Time-Loop Love Story,7,12 February 2021,"Who gets a haircut and their scalp is perfectly tanned? Who gets $100 bills out of ATM's? How can someone in a constant time-loop not figure out what someone wants when nothing else works? Also, if one has been in a time-loop a thousand or more times, knows almost every little thing that will happen, how difficult is it to find a dog? It's the little things that stick out to people in time-loop films.The cliché of doing a topic over and over again is us inevitably in a time-loop. What I think makes a great love story to watch is the one viewing it becomes enamored with one or both of the characters who is in the love story. Mark (Kyle Allen) is the one we start off with. We see through his daily routine that he's been in the loop for quite awhile, so in essence: we learn nothing about him except he has a father in his life, a mother that works, apparently, a lot, a younger sister who's on the soccer team, and a best friend who he talks to but...they're all inconsequential to each other because we're stuck watching his carefree life. There's no tribulation. Then enters Margaret (Kathryn Newton) who, apparently, may have been in the time-loop just as long as Mark but that's the impression and she still seems to have her wits about her, even if she acts a little too carefree, and how they only just ran into each other in a seemingly small town where they go to the same school, per sé?50 minutes in I was expecting something, anything, and the build up is there but nothing. I didn't care about the characters because one doesn't really learn anything about them to care anything about them. What kind of people are they? What's the emotional pull for us to them? None of this is shown until the last 20-30 minutes and by then...who cares? Time is a human invention. It can mean something. Everything important in this film is in the last 25 minutes; we were only seeing his life and not hers. One may attach themselves to him by the end but the character of Margaret just seemed like fodder up to that point, and that doesn't make a love story whether Margaret's love for Mark or for her mother. We should have gotten more of Margaret's story except in the last 15-20 minutes. But then that was the entire point of the film.Did it work?",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

As they try to figure out how to get out of it, they, of course, fall in love.

27,Golden_Hope,For Existential Teenagers,5,14 February 2021,"The movie is pretty average across the board. It uses a extremely over done thing in film and does it passingly.It isn't some cringefest teen drama which i expected it to be. It wants to be more than that. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing because it was really pseudo intellectual. It really thought it was cracking new ground or wanted its teen viewers to feel like ""wow iv just had my eyes opened'.I think that Palm Springs (2020) did this in a much better way all around. It has the same sort of ideas under everything but Palm Springs delivers it in a more charming, funny and subtler way than this movie. This movie what's to bash you over the head with its ideas and beg you to believe that it may be the most eye opening thing that has ever grace the face of the earth.Like i said i think this is better than it being a throw away teen romcom i just think it should have subdued its message. People would have got it without it shoving it in your face.The acting was fine and so was the writing. I think the writing showed the teen part of the movie the most.

Funny, intelligent, thought-provoking, real feeling characters, and a well made plot line.All things missing from this film.You see, there's a ""time loop"", and our protagonists are stuck in it. It's a fine pretense, but it's mostly done in a very dull / ""been there done that"" sort of way, like even the characters themselves are mostly unimpressed by the situation they are in.(Hollywood side note: As I'm sure it's not lost on some people, this film shares shocking similarities to a film that came out just about a year before this one, ""Palm Springs"", that also has a ""devil may care"" lead woman character and joins the action midstream. Like Dante's Peak and Volcano coming out the same year, or Deep Impact and Armageddon, apparently the same ""repeating day"" script was floating around Hollywood at the same time.)Much like last year's ""Palm Springs"", no attempt is made to cash in on the instant comedy and drama that would be built into someone discovering their day is repeating as it happened, instead we join the action midstream, like you get the idea they've been doing this already hundreds of times, or more. It helps catch you up on the story quickly, but it's lazy, and the characters seem mostly unphased by it all.What's even more lazy is when you find out the ""cause"" of the repetition. I won't go into all of it here, but It makes zero sense in an already nonsensical plot, like, is the lead actress just a god or something? Oh wait, it's because she's ""good at math"". Okay?Anyway, the entire plot is actually just an excuse for a very corny, teeniebopper cringe romance.I love the concept of time loop films, but this one was just absolutely the path of least resistance, as if whoever wrote it couldn't be bothered it make sense of it all, so they just don't.

Not to mention that almost each one involves some sort of superhero or villain nowadays, and although I very much enjoy that genre also, I can't tell you enough how pleased I was to find the treasure which is The Map of Tiny Perfect Things. To find, and share with you, that it does so much more, and more powerfully, than what bigger, flashier films try, with such a small footprint, is been beyond delightful.Kyle Allen steals the show as Mark. His easy chemistry with the screen is magic. Kathryn Newton is a little less fluid in her role as Margaret, especially at the beginning. The small, seldom-seen, supporting cast is tremendous.As for the tiny perfect things, some indeed are tiny, or perhaps not on the level you or I would consider to be perfect. In fact, a better definition might be: things that makes us smile and think. In any case, the film uses them effectively in that they do indeed bring a smile, and we think; and in fact, we may miss some if we blink. More so, however, they are effective in that we cannot help, at least for a brief time after watching the film, to look for our own.In closing, this is a rich, yet simple film with deeper undercurrents of love and loss, yes, but more so, beyond being tender and uplifting, it is generous in its message that there are miracles around us every single day, if we just look a little.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

Kathryn Newton isn't attractive enough to pique our interest or serve as a credible romantic prize, which is where these things always.They're sexless, as well. They could be any gender.The girl's ignorance is on an essential point is unintentional. Why would one assume that what they're dealing with is in any way Euclidean? She claims that time is not the fourth dimension, when according to Einsteinian spacetime, which superceded the Euclidean, time is indeed the fourth dimension, and there's no reason to think this repetition is only occurring on some Euclidean scale.Then she misunderstands the representation of a fourth, spatial dimension, treating it as a very real thing, then as a kind of metaphor, which is not unreasonable, but it ultimately makes no sense.The search for perfect things is okay, but it's gotten a bit dull and we're only 33m in, and he's in the process of trying to ""win"" the girl, as if she was the what mattered. Ugh.""It's all I got. Take it or leave it."" Way to be a piece of crap. And like a weakling he mumbles he'll accept it. How can boys grow up sanely when this garbage is all they see, day in day out?At the midpoint of the run time he's at his nadir, having made an incredible series of moves that only resulted in a flat and even insulting rejection.The script blunders with an unpleasant exchange between the lead and Al Madrigal, who brings nothing to the role of a needlessly irritated algebra teacher. Why not get a very talented comedian to play the role and shoot for something like a scene between Bill Murray and Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky). With this one, they're not even trying.So he ends up interpreting all this as 'she made me a better man' and that his own life isn't even his story, and we're supposed to believe this is personal progress. Then we get ridiculous 'wisdom' from her mother who's dying of cancer. ""It's never too late, unless you're dying of cancer."" Spare me your delusional American fantasy of hope.It's the horror of contemporary feminism, writ small, but then in having the girl realizing she has feelings for him, it's trying to eat its cake and have it too.
Then she has her realization about all this with Mark's friend, not Mark, which is a poor script decision, though consistent with the narrative abandoning Mark entirely, which is consistent, anyway, with this feminist subversion perversion of Groundhog Day.His function ends up being to comfort her. She actually says, You're here so I wouldn't have to be alone, and he nods along like a good doggy. ""Okay,"" he says.I turned off this travesty with a few minutes left.

It tries soo hard to be original - even when it spends the whole movie commenting on similar movies. The acting is really ropey (sorry) which gets even more cringey when combined with the some (most) of the cheesy narrative.Plot holes are also an issue.

56,urbanswami,In a loop,8,12 February 2021,"Grounhog day, Edge of tomorrow, Palm Springs, Boss level, The map of tiny perfect things.
The common theme is being stuk in a rut. The plot is centered around overcoming tedium, disappointment in one's self, confronting some form of crisis that stops the protagonist dead in his or her tracks. It's the most basic recipe of a bildungsroman. The protagonist is forced to relive the same day untill he or she gets ""it"" right. Untill he or she find that wich he or she (respectively) is lacking, but desperately needs to move on and have a life. Sometimes ""it"" is something heroic, extraordinary, other times mundane. But always, and I mean always ""it"" involves a reinvention of one's self. Doing away with the old and letting something new arise. It's a lengthy, and oftentimes a painful process.
The reason I needed to expand on this is because this theme, which is quickly becoming a genre, is a basic form of telling a story about personal growth. It's as old as mankind. Recently, it is also being overused.
Midlife crisis solved by personal connection, cowardice overcome by a sense of caring and taking on responsibility, jadedness supplanted by love, escaping cynicism by shouldering the weight of the world, respectively. Now, finally we get emotional pain eased by meaningful connection, dare I say love.
I get it, it's true. It's a heartwarming tale, it's also lazy. Not on the part of the creators of this movie or any of the aformentioned, because these movies are good, rather on the part of the industry itself. Also due to the current references, this movie won't age well.
Watch this movie, you'll like it I'm sure. And don't forget: meaningful personal connections and personal responsibility before anything else, lest we have a dozen more of these movies. Let's let the movie industry work for it's money; in the meantime if you need a reminder, just open the Bible, read buddhist texts or really any classic of western literature; or just watch these movies on a loop.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

It goes about as well as it could have.",6,7 March 2021,"I've watched this once all the way through, and then again to the half-way point a week or so later after puzzling over it. -Partly because I liked the male lead and some of the story mechanics, but also because the weak and broken points of this movie were fascinating; ""How would I fix this?""Broken things are interesting.So.., I liked the male lead; he seemed genuine and kind. The actor made it seem effortless.The girl, by contrast, was stuck having to portray an anti-social and quite unlikable character. The production team worked the actress hard only to achieve a thoroughly forced caricature of the 'strong, independent woman', constantly sneering at the male half of the human equation. If that's the day you find yourself stuck in... Heaven help you.Now, with more self-awareness, this element could have provided fodder for a very interesting film indeed, but most of the psychology responsible was happening beyond the cognition of the creators, down on some automatic level. True, there was an inkling of character growth, (partly the reason I didn't write this movie off entirely and came back for a second look), where the female lead recognized that, ""I met a nice boy, but I messed it all up"", drawing a useful conclusion between behavior and outcome, but that lesson was smothered beneath external ideological demands the writer wasn't free of. So instead, the film was primarily an exercise in artificially elevating the feminine at the expense of the masculine.I'm guessing that the film makers don't know that truly strong women out here in the real world are completely different.Genuinely strong women don't have to be snide, secretive, emotionally shallow fakes in order to hold power. That's what weak, bitter people do in an effort to compensate. People actually LIKE being around genuinely strong women, are indeed guided and changed by them in ways this film hasn't managed to divine. Folks really need to get out there and encounter the feminine principle in person sometime, and for goodness sake, avoid feeling threatened to the point of attacking it when they do.So.., my advice to the creative team responsible, allow me to mansplain: In the future, (heh), don't let some post-modern ideology poison what could have been a strong and inspiring film.

No movies that I know of have really done anything new with the concept, but they at least manage some sense of charm and intrigue. Unfortunately, the painfully generic Map of Tiny Perfect Things flounders in that department.The story is pretty much exactly what you'd expect. It's so predictable, that it's entirely unnecessary to put it in this review. Just read the basic premise and title, and you've already got a pretty good idea as to where it's going.Now, that on its own wouldn't be a problem. The similarly predictable Palm Springs managed to be incredibly enjoyable, thanks to great performances, some funny lines, and solid writing. The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is just... meh in every department. The performances are serviceable, but they aren't exceptional. The writing does okay, but there's really nothing memorable. And there is but one funny line in the entire movie, which inexplicably is said in the middle of what I assume was supposed to be an emotional scene.Additionally, the whole film has an aggressive Indie vibe, as if every frame is screaming ""WE WEREN'T MADE BY A BIG MOVIE STUDIO."" This is especially strange, considering that it was made by Amazon, one of the largest companies in the world. Because of this, the whole film has this underlying sense of corporate control that was almost a little eerie. For example, it feels like the love interest has a sad backstory not so that the audience can empathize with her, but rather because the studio heads say it'll make people cry. Honestly, this strange tone persisted throughout the movie, and I was more than a little uncomfortable with it.Overall, the Map of Tiny Perfect Things is harmless and doesn't really have anything horrible in it. Items just so cookie-cutter and bland, taking an overdone premise and doing nothing new with it. I suppose it will make for a serviceable movie-watching experience, but frankly there are much better time travel movies out there (Safety Not Guaranteed on Netflix, Palm Springs on Hulu, and Donnie Darko come to mind).

It doesn't try to hide the fact that it's a time loop movie. It just has fun with the idea of being stuck in the same day. Then after some fun moments with the protagonist we meet the other character who is stuck in the loop. After that the movie just becomes very loveable. From the moment they meet I couldn't help but smile. The main actors are so good together. Their acting is also fantastic. My main problem with the movie start around the second act. What makes the movie strong is that it doesn't try to be complicated in the first half. It just shows that a story that we know can still be fun. That's exactly why I didn't like the second half as much. It tries to be more that it is and overcomplicated things. I also didn't like the storyline of everything revolves around us.

Driving bad with a car, smashing things up for fun...So the guy finds it important to chat with his friend around the same time. And allthough he lived the same day a lot.. It is apparently an important conversation...the opening scene is in sharp contrast with how oblivious he is about his own family...What he is doing towards the girl at a certain point like following her when she doesn't realize it.... well it sort of is stalking.So how to review a movie which needs the sort of stalking scene to advance the story....
(It doesn't really need it but it uses it) they could have done that with they meeting unaware of each others presence in the hospital and just lettingthe camera follow her . Than I only have to get past the vandalism part and the unnecessary shaky camerawork.TImestamp

the media is at fault to. In my country the National Television has aired a show life after the pandemic.... it is a documentary.... (it should be science fiction since it isn't over)So a movie about timeloop to me either has to be timeless or have anything that binds it to a time...

Nor does the movie do anything original with the concept.Which is a shame because in the last third of the movie, two ideas are tossed out casually that actually do bring something original to the table. However, THIS movie is only concerned with re-visiting the tropes of the genre so those ideas aren't explored at all.No spoilers here but the central idea is: Instead of trying to break out of the loop, what if there was a compelling reason to stay within the time loop... so compelling that you would do anything to prevent it?Imagine what you could do with that idea instead.

111,swordmccloud,Time loop movie surpasses all time loop movies,10,18 August 2021,"I know that it sounds insane to think of all the time loop movies that Ground Hog day could ever be anything but number one. I too thought that. I actually thought that all the way through watching this movie and the day after. The change occurred when I could not stop thinking of this movie. It really is insane in most of the other ones the character or characters stuck in the loop are great because they are smart alecs. So that is what I think I kept looking for. Funny quips or stupid pranks that you would pull on people. This movie has so little of that. If anything it is like the characters have already skipped all of that and are 100 or even thousand of years into this loop. What both find out is joy and love are always worth it. So what I saw was characters who are already good characters who grow and become even better characters. Both deal with something different. One character has to realize that while he thinks he is helping others, there is still apart of him which is selfish. Learning to feel others pain is such a strong lesson to learn. The other character has to be willing to learn to face death of a family member. To be willing to let go. The romance is good. But it is slow building. It is clearly worth waiting for! This movie does another thing i had never seen in any loop movie or even other movies. It makes you think the main character, yet by the end you realize while he is important to the story, it is her story. He just helps her complete it! I will watch this again.

Yes, I think it's true that hollywood is annoyingly using the same tropes over and over again. I think that the makers of this movie wanted to give a specific message and tell their story through this unoriginal concept. Some of the negative reviewers are saying that this film has nothing new to offer, but I disagree. I think that it brings up some good questions about life. I really think that this movie is more than just a run of the mill teen romance. It seems like most teen flicks feel the need to be edgy and trashy. While many enjoy that, it isn't everyone's cup of tea.I enjoyed how colorful it is and I thought that the acting was really good. I think that it manages to be quirky without diving into annoying territory. I think that it blended the drama and humor together well. I liked the soundtrack. That one shot scene was done so well!Perhaps this movie is more deep than it's meant to be. I agree with the comments about how it's another teen movie getting all existential, but I still like the way that it was handled. I love good symbolism in any story. The dog represents all the time that can pass by. We see so much but are missing exactly what we're looking for, even when it's right there in front of us. The angel wings. I believe that they represent how there's always good in this world of evil. The eagle catching the fish from the lake. Well, the female character explains that one. Spoiler- rain in stories usually symbolizes the new in life. Washing away the old. It could mean that there's something better. I suppose that there could be even more that I missed.Unfortunately, once again they cast actors that are too old to be playing teens. I also was not a fan of the sob story plot twist near the end.I was also SO disappointed that they ended up kissing at the end. I love stories that are simply just about friendship and I got my hopes up with this one. I almost believed that they wouldn't end up together at the end.

139,accounstv,Very nice,7,23 February 2021,"As a sexagenarian, I am not the target audience for this film but I like anything that is good. I was thumbing through my Roku looking for a movie to play while I gamed and read a book. The reason I stopped to play this film was because I had seen Kathryn Newton the previous day in ""Freaky."" She is very good here as she was in that film.Another reviewer said that they were ""drawn into the film"" and so was I. My gaming stopped as did the book reading and my attention became focused on MTPT. I found it charming and Ms. Newton was very good as was Jermaine Harris, but felt that Mr. Allen failed to deliver on some one word lines that would have improved the quality of his performance and the film. The director should have caught these and worked with him on the line deliveries and the fact that he did not may represent a shortfall in Ian Samuels' ability, at least this point in his career.Overall, a very nice and charming little film, which is the type I love to find. A lot of reviewers are rating this a nine, but I'm a hard marker and will give it a seven, which is pretty good since I gave Hitchcock's ""Foreign Correspondent"" a six.Well worth your time and attention.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

Similar in concept to Groundhog Day, where the same day is experienced over and over, this movie expands on that theme. It explores one repeating day through the eyes of a young man and draws you into his world. That day continues to repeat itself until suddenly he meets a girl who is having the same repeated day. They hang together and see that day in a new way. Perfect tableau's appearing in front of them for moments through that day. You see these moments just as they see them. Tiny, perfect things.

But if you are looking for something actually different do not watch. In my opinion this movie is nothing special. They are trying way to hard to make the girl character "" quirky"" and "" unique"" she's nice but she's the definition of the kind of girl producers try to make when they try to make that one girl look "" quirky and different"" The storyline is basic and nothing new. I understand the message is super sweet and inspirational, to find the perfect things in my life. But in my opinion they chose the wrong characters for this. My idea of what the concept in that topic should be is to find the unexpected even in the expected. And the fact is you could pull a guy and a girl like him from any basic highschool and force them to see the "" beautiful in life"" and they would all act the same. Plus the romance is basically forced because the guy really wanted to meet someone and he could have met any girl who was cute or "" quirky"" and been like I like you. And that's not unique or different at all. Because without the loop it would have just been like those basic highschool movies where the "" different girl"" meets the nice but hot guy. The only slightly unique thing is the idea of trying to find the perfect things in life but it's delivered in such a basic way with a basic cast.

There's spoon full of cliche romance concept in it with the guy begging to get laid or get a kiss and girl just passing it on for 98% time of the movie.In the end when the actually kisses the guy just for the sake of *one last perfect thing* it was so CRINGE WORTHY!

They throw around words like temporal anomaly and singularity without any further explanation to this infallible idea and believe we should understand it. The movie ends by wrapping up the most insignificant subplot. Almost every conversation our characters have are what they should do with infinite time, and during these conversations, they never stay still: they do something out of the ordinary and act like it's perfectly normal. Literally every side-character is generic and useless, as they serve the same metaphor. I was vastly uninterested in these characters to the point where when the movie Psycho'd itself and replaced the main character, I was tempted to stop watching.

205,brettfarrell,Its... ok,4,25 February 2021,"If you smile, kick back, and dont think too hard this movie is pretty enjoyableIf you DO want to think at all during this movie you'll likely realize that its predictable (not necessarily a bad thing) and too caught up in itself, much like a teenagerThe main character doesn't do anything really wild with his infinite do-overs and skips through his morning routine of glibly helping and also trolling people around him since he knows what's going to happen to them, and when he meets the Smart Girl who is also in the loop with him (who wants to work for NASA and does smart people things like math and solving a Rubiks cube) they try to find all of the events that they inconsistently define as perfect in their small townThere are a couple little twists and a bit of drama, but overall it definitley wants to be deeper than it is",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
206,jmn-83551,"Acting so modest and grounded that it becomes innovative, and deeply enjoyable.",9,17 March 2021,"For a rom com with modest ambitions, I found it extremely enjoyable. One reviewer criticized the characters as lacking in flaws, but that made it feel more real to me. The characters have flaws, but most real life young adults are pretty good people and aren't boiling over with so much drama that they end up yelling at each other before kissing each other in a thunderstorm. I think it had more emotional depth for the lack of heightened drama, not less, and is challenging cinema norms in a very needed way. Not all of film needs to be soap opera and Shakespearian theater. There is a place for grounded portrayal of ordinary people, because in the end real life is bigger than our imaginations. When Hollywood is drowning us in fake or cheap drama, this has the potential to be revolutionary. I hope it has influence.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

209,davidsanders-92836,Good one-liners and a powerful theme,10,19 May 2021,This movie gave me constant chuckles since it has its own twist on Groundhog's Day.I really love when a movie portrays hidden messages and themes about life such as this movie. Made me relate to my current events and past memories.,The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
210,ta-19668,Starts off with so much promise,4,20 July 2021,"It starts so well; Kyle Allen's character is really likeable and fun. The fact that it launches right in where he is already repeating the day is refreshing; we are able to skip the slow first time through the day for him. His sister and friend are interesting characters but are in it just for moments; and there is a lot that could be explored with his father.Unfortunately, I didn't see much chemistry between him and Newton's character. Despite the plotlines that should give her a lot of depth and empathy, she always seemed flat compared to the other characters.The repeating the day story line is well worn but so is the 'romance with the slightly aloof girl that has a secret' story line and that addition feels forced in what is an otherwise nicely flowing story. Instead of adding electricity to the movie it drains it; leaving me wishing for more solo adventures or that he'd drag his friend or sister out for a day an get to know them more.It wasn't a bad movie; however the good parts make the not so good parts look even worse. A transition from lighthearted to more serious would be fine but it needs to be well done with characters you care about. Overall, I'd have been fine to have missed this one.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
211,phrprcp,"A great, refreshing film in the teen rom-com genre",8,8 August 2021,"Usually teen rom-coms are not my thing. Cheesy acting and unrealistic dialogue are usually the two main things that stick out to me in those type of films, apart from being centered around the same tropes that have died with the early 2010s. The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is not that film. Watching this movie was like reading a novel I never read, but always wanted to. It had everything I was looking for in a coming of age, love story that I usually hope to find but never do. Teens talking about normal life in a way that actually resonates. The MC is a funny, smart and overly shy guy who is just trying to find a girlfriend in his small town, on a day that he already knows is repeating. Most films with this 'Ground-Hog Day' trope is introducing us to this time-loop the same time as the MC. This film doesn't do that either. The only thing that bothered me was the ending. It left me with no real explanation to the cause of the time-loop, so much so, I thought I missed it and I had to rewind. I'm sure the ending was meant to be more meaningful and human than a Syfy ending. All and all, great film.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things
212,quyana,"Nice whimsy, lots to think about",7,30 August 2021,"I recently signed up for an Amazon prime trial to avoid spending gift cards on shipping. Naturally, I was interested in catching some of the Amazon original productions, while the parent corp isn't great the studios were worse and I'm much more interested in even limited originality than the branded comics cinema.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things jumped out at me as a good movie for a lazy Sunday. Groundhog's Day, but with cool teen protagonists and that smarmy John Green in-joke sensibility. Like Blockbuster in distant memory, thousands of bland shows without even a conceit or gimmick crowd the displays. You can only watch Amelie for the first time once. After that, you can keep watching movies like Amelie night after night but a lot of the imitations are less successful than the original.Repeating days appeal to everyone in hyperproductive America, especially the teens, who must mark at least a thousand or so days in public school and various supplied activities. There is a entire curriculum of universal media references that must be experienced in order to be understood, in order to join popular culture where everyone knows the general outline already. Often, like the vestigial loan words of English, the original property only vaguely resembles its cumulative referential meaning. The rote experience of education and daily motion. The fetishized freedom to spend measly savings or risk genuine injury. In triumphal consumerism, every day is an endless repetition.Neither TMoTPT nor Groundhog's Day really explore the limits of their central conceit, an endlessly-repeated day. Groundhog's Midnight Cowboy scene and TPT's trashing the show home only allude to Existential degradation and violence, without seriously exploring a more gory or destructive reality. A sight gag of stolen construction equipment never becomes Killdozer; the flirtations are chaste; the inebriation is subdued.This conceit is attractive to theater kids, it realizes the dream (especially in rural Alaska) of actually mastering the repetitive motions of life. Of being so absurdly informed and ahead of the game that you know the right motion, leagues in advance. Of actually being able to help and change things. It's also aligned with the digital video game reality, where we can return continually to the same circumstances and try to do them right this go-around.TPT leans into the premise of wish-fulfillment through more time. It ignores the reality of muscle memory, its fantasy is a little too childish. The gender relations seem incel-adjacent, lonely men mansplaining what's actually happening to anyone trapped in their orbit. The final romance a glum settling. I'd rather explore the Big Fish universe of circus-adjacent magical realism. Imagine if the timecube and the dog were actually meaningful symbols, rather than more supplied gimmicks.Chronologically, it is thoroughly 2019, no masks in sight, the public space full of casual touch and interactions. There is hospital imagery without any menace.Right now I'm pretty happy watching people play video games, rather than seeking out movies. The video game players are less demanding, requiring little discernment or funds to watch. Often, they supply action and intrigue superior to bland movies, which at best are like other movies. Low budget science fiction and human interest movies look like video games already, at least the streamers often have chat and other feedback, that make them more than the endless loop of media content.",The Map of Tiny Perfect Things

I assume a profound ""meaning of life"" message was supposed to be hidden in there, too.

There have been so many of stuck-in-a-day time loop movie, almost one every year. And I have watched many of them. But this is so far the sweetest one for me. It is more than just a time loop story, but also a story of 2 teenagers trying to find the meaning of lives, discovering themselves, trying to do good the people around them, and also, most importantly, to fall in love with each other. Beyond that, it is also a ""day"" for them to discover their love for friends, families and strangers. Instead of making pranks, making money or taking advantage of people, they choose to help people and trying to make the world a better place, with some mild fun along the way.
