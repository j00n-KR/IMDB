0,MartinHafer,"An interesting portrait of an angry, repressed and borderline lady....but who would want to watch it other than a therapist?!",3,19 November 2020,"""La Pianiste"" is not a film for everyone. Although the film garnered some awards at Cannes and other film festivals, it is more a film festival sort of film than a mainstream film the average person would watch and enjoy. This is not necessarily a complaint...more an observation about the plot, style and characters in this film. It simply is a movie that would be off-putting to most viewers. After all, the leading character is unlikable and an emotional basket case--not the sort of person folks would want to see on a date night at the theater! Again...this is NOT a complaint. I mention this because you might want to think twice before watching the film. The other reason is that the movie has some very graphic moments...such as some very graphic sex scenes as well as scenes where the leading lady is genitally mutilating herself (fortunately this is not nearly so graphic). Yes, this lady with a Borderline Personality cuts on her genitals because of her many emotional problems...so this isn't exactly ""Singing in the Rain"" or ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg""!When the film begins, you see Erika (Isabelle Huppert) going through her daily routine as a piano teacher. You also see her engage in some very dysfunctional interactions with her emotionally abusive and sick mother (with whom she lives) as well as Erika going to sex shops and drive-in movie theaters to watch folks make love! Clearly she's not a happy person, though in every interaction you see, she's also caustic, cruel and nasty...the sort of person you'd never hope to meet. Most psychotherapists would likely diagnose her with a Borderline Personality--especially in light of her self-harm (cutting) and antisocial behaviors. Most others would avoid her like the plague.Despite Erika being a thoroughly unlikable and pathetic person, a very talented young pianist, Walter (Benoît Magimel) is inexplicably attracted to her. She never gives him any indication she's interested. In fact, she does a lot to push him away by insulting him and his talent. Yet, despite all this, he arranges for her to become his teacher, as he wants to use this to get closer to her. Clearly Walter has a few issues of his own and this is not a typical romance film!This film is a tough one for viewers. While the portrait of Erika is very interesting and well done in many ways, making her so difficult to like seriously compromises the watchability of the film. In other words, if you strongly dislike a protagonist in a movie, how likely are you to continue watching it? You feel a bit sorry for her...but mostly you dislike her and would never want to associate with someone this nasty (such as when she pours broken glass into a woman's coat or berates her for having diarrhea). I think making her more pathetic and sad as opposed to cruel would have improved the film's watchability tremendously...though it might have been a less interesting psychological portrait.Technically, this film is well made and the acting is good. But it's also about a much fun to watch as war atrocities....making it a film more for elitists than the average person.",The Piano Teacher
1,TheLittleSongbird,Powerful and shocking with a superb lead performance,8,27 October 2012,"The Piano Teacher is not an easy watch and is not going to be everybody's cup of tea. I for one found it a powerful and sometimes beautiful film. I will admit the first half is better than the second however. The second half does take a nosedive in plausibility particularly a really awkward moment where Erika takes out her sexual frustrations onto her own mother, while the first half is absolutely fascinating. The Piano Teacher is very well made, bleak and somewhat cold in colour palette but at the same time sumptuous. The cinematography is splendid, as is Michael Haneke's sure-handed direction. The music is outstanding, Schubert's music- Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Schoenberg and what sounded like Bach in the two pianos-playing sequence- is the most frequent and it is deliciously lyrical though the repetition of Im Dorfe- the one with the growling-sounding bass line- is likely to haunt your mind. I also have to say the piano playing is amazing, some of the best I have ever heard. The script has its very thoughtful moments in the piano teaching sequences and the letter scene actually is revealing about Erika's sexually frustrated and somewhat warped state of mind. The sex scenes though do have some lines that are likely to make you go ""um, okay"", the worst offender being the penis-related one in the bathroom sex scene.The story is interesting in life as a piano teacher and how the pieces are interpreted and has some genuinely disturbing moments primarily Erika cutting herself, Erika's attack inflicted by Walter and the rape scene. The ending is interpretative and on the abrupt side but was a clever and fitting to end the film. The characters are not easy to empathise with, the main character especially is very cold while Walter is somewhat relateable until his terrifying change in character. The performances are really great. Isabelle Huppert is incredible in a difficult(both in character and how she relates to the audience)role with eyes and delivery that tell a huge amount. Benoit Magimal is a charmer in the first half, and once Walter is repulsed by the letter his change in character does manage to terrify. Annie Giradot is perfect as the stuffy mother figure, and the rest of the cast give good performances if not quite up to the standard set by the three leads.Overall, powerful, beautiful and shocking, not perfect but very effective. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",The Piano Teacher
2,SnoopyStyle,Isabelle Huppert damaged,7,17 June 2016,"Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) has a volatile home life with her combative mother leading to violence at times. Erika has disturbing sexual tendencies such as porn shop visits, self-mutilations, and voyeurism. She's a piano professor at a conservatory. She's hard on her students especially the fragile Anna Schober. Walter Klemmer is a new student at the conservatory despite her objection. He's taken with her and she eventually lets him into her sexually disturbed world.Isabelle Huppert has such great screen presence. She's great at playing damaged, vulnerable, and cold. It's not the most fun watch. There are a couple of really weird scenes. Her relationship with her mother is outrageous. This is an interesting character study of a troubled woman.",The Piano Teacher
3,Hitchcoc,Disturbing to Say the Least,8,3 February 2016,"This is my second experience with a film by Haneke, We have an incredibly intense, repressed character, played by Isabel Huppert. She lives with her mother and they involve themselves in a love/hate relationship. As a piano teacher she is a cruel taskmaster. It is obvious that she is sought after despite her almost sadistic vent. When she is not at work she visits a sex shop and watches pornography. She also goes to drive-in movies and peeks into cars at couples having sex. She is likewise, self-abusive. She is not unlike a fascist state in her demeanor. She meets a young, incredibly talented piano student who wants to be in her master class. There is sexual tension here. He begins to lust after her. She is cold but attractive, although at times her very being seems somewhat beyond her years. He really loves her and we know that somehow these two will meet in some way. He plays hockey and there is a kind of male testosterone thing going on. She has a stilted view of sexuality. He has the more traditional view, being on the make and wanting things to be consensual. This movie contains some of the sickest scenes I've seen. There is one scene in a public toilet where things get quite deranged. I have couple more Haneke films to see soon. They are certainly thought provoking.",The Piano Teacher
4,claudio_carvalho,Love Hurts  A Weird Tale of Repressed Sexuality,9,8 October 2004,"In Vienna, Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) is a sick single forty years old piano teacher of the music conservatory. She lives alone with her dominative mother and due to her repressed sexuality, she self-mutilates her sex, visits porno shops in the nights looking for peep-shows and has a weird and abnormal behavior regarding sex. In a recital, Erika is introduced to Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), an young student of engineering and excellent pianist, and he falls in love with her. Their perverted affair destabilizes the fragile emotional control of Erika. This weird tale of repressed sexuality of a woman has magnificent performances of Isabelle Huppert and Benoit Magimel, very well supported by Annie Girardort. The beginning of the story is amazing and Isabelle Huppert has one of the best performances of her stunning career, I even dare to say that it is one of her best roles. Although recommended only to specific audiences, this complex and sick love story is an excellent film. It won the Grand Jury Prize at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and the Austrian novelist Elfriede Jelinek won the 2004 Nobel Prize in literature two days ago. The direction of Michael Haneke is precise and sharp as usual. If 'Le Pianist' were an American movie, it would probably be among the IMDb Top 250. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'A Professora de Piano' (The Piano Teacher')",The Piano Teacher
5,jboothmillard,The Piano Teacher,5,6 October 2019,"This French film was previously listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, the title made it obvious what the leading character was, but I didn't know anything about the plot, it did sound very interesting, directed by Michael Haneke (Funny Games, The White Ribbon, Amour). Basically, in Vienna, Erika Kohut (Elle's Isabelle Huppert) is a middle-aged piano professor at a music conservatory who lives with her domineering elderly mother (Annie Girardot), while her father was living in psychiatric asylum and has recently died. Despite her professional demeanour and secure nature, Erika is lonely and is sexually repressed. Erika often satisfies her cravings with voyeurism, renting pornographic films, having sadomasochistic fetishes and mutilates herself, cutting herself on intimate parts of the body. Dr. George Blonskij (Udo Samel) and his wife Gerda (Cornelia Köndgen) host a recital, there Erika meets young aspiring engineer Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel), he also plays piano and admires her skill in classical music. The two appreciate composers like Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert, and he wants to apply to conservatory to be her pupil. His audition impresses the other professors, Erika is visibly moved, but votes against him; citing his divergent interpretation, and questioning his motivations. Despite this, Walter is admitted as Erika's pupil. Meanwhile, Anna Schober (Anna Sigalevitch) is a pupil struggling with anxiety and being pushed by her ambitious mother (Susanne Lothar). Erika witnesses Anna and Walter socialising, angry she slips broken shards of a drinking glass into one of Anna's coat pockets. Anna injures her right hand, ruining her chance to play at the forthcoming jubilee concert. Walter pursues Erika into the toilet immediately after she secretly injured Anna. Walter passionately kisses Erika, and she responds by repeatedly humiliating and frustrating him. She proceeds to give him a handjob, but abruptly stops when he does not abide by her orders. She also performs fellatio on him, but again stops when he does not listen to her. She tells him she will write him a letter regarding their next meeting. Later at the conservatory, Erika pretends to be sympathetic towards Anna's mother, saying only she can substitute for Anna in the upcoming school concert at such short notice. Walter is increasingly insistent wanting a sexual relationship with Erika, but she is only willing if he will satisfy her masochistic fantasies. She gives him the letter listing acts she will consent to, but he is repulsed by it. She later meets him to apologise, and the two engage in a sexual encounter in a small room. But Erika is unable to finish and vomits after Walter attempts to penetrate her. Later that night, Walter arrives at Erika's apartment and follows an act as described in her letter. He locks her mother away in her bedroom before proceeding to beat and rape Erika. The next day, Erika brings a kitchen knife to the concert where she is scheduled to substitute for Anna. Walter arrives in high spirits with his family, and flippantly greets her. Moments before the concert is about to begin, a distraught Erika stabs herself in the shoulder with the kitchen knife and exits the concert hall into the street. Also starring Thomas Weinhappel as Baritone. Huppert gives a terrific performance as the professional with secret violent sexual fetishes, it obviously has the controversial material and melodrama, and is dark and disturbing most of the time, but you can appreciate it for celebrating great music as well, it is odd, grim and perhaps implausible, but an interesting drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Worth watching!",The Piano Teacher
6,rmax304823,Getting It Off Your Chest.,7,24 February 2012,"It's a very fine character study for the first half, even if a bit obvious. Isabelle Huppert runs with the ball. She's a distinguished professor of music in Paris. Students compete for admission to her Master Class in piano.I'm not sure why. She's evidently an inspiring teacher. She obviously loves music. But, my God, is she demanding. And stern and distant and icy. Her hair is severely swept back and she never smiles. She has no sense of humor, no role distance, and her ordinary social graces are no better than perfunctory. You get a feeling that if she stared at you too long you'd turn into an ice sculpture than only faintly resembled your original self.I had judged -- from the DVD case cover, showing her struggling in a kiss with a younger man while kneeling on a bathroom floor -- that this was going to be a sort of ""Lolita"" with the genders reversed, some kind of pathetic tragedy. Beautiful sexual interludes with softly billowing curtains and scented candles, ending with a funeral in the rain.But, no. It's pretty good. As for the performances, we have the central figure of the middle-aged spinster Huppert, locked into her frigid respectability. And then there is Annie Girardot as her disputatious and domineering mother, Girardot who was a sexy presence all over the screen in the 1960s, now become a magnificent wreck. The passing years do that to everyone except me. I seem to grow more youthfully radiant with every passing day. Benoît Magimel is tall, muscular, handsome, and a talented if flippant pianist in her class, but if at first he's an ardent admirer, maybe a little too ardent, he becomes a cipher.Well, we know ahead of time that Huppert is going to bust loose. She has to, otherwise we have a pretty dreary film experience ahead of us. And she does bust loose, but not in ways anyone might expect. She's utterly sexless until she boldly walks into some sort of porno shop, rents a booth, and watches skin flicks without any expression. Then she picks up a discarded tissue from the floor and holds it against her nose. A little twisted, if you ask me. And not just that, but she perches on the rim of her bath tub, spreads her legs, reaches up into her crotch, fiddles around and winces. Okay. We're all adults so we think we know what's up. But then she withdraws her hand and we see that it's holding a razor blade, and we notice a trickle of blood running into the tub. This is many leagues away from soft core porn.The first half ends with her responding to Magimel's protestations of love but again not in the way we might expect. She deliberately arouses Magimel physically on that bathroom floor but leaves him hanging, exiting with an expression of disdain. Later, despite her mother's strenuous objections she takes Magimel into her bedroom. She ""takes"" him; she doesn't ""invite"" him. And she makes him read aloud the terms of her agreement with him before they engage in any hanky panky. She wants to be blindfolded, slapped, tied up really tight, and made to rim him. That's -- how you say? -- degoutant.That's about the half-way point. After that the movie more or less collapses and throws logic and character to the winds. Magimel, after reading her list of demands, calls her ""pathetic"" and ""sick"". He tells her she needs treatment. Then he stalks out of the bedroom, offended, revolted. Any normal kid his age would try to talk her down, negotiate with her. ""How about if we eliminate Demand Number Five?"", or something. But his change in attitude is instantaneous and resolute.It gets worse. He barges into her apartment in the middle of the night, locks the howling mother in her room, and begins slapping and kicking Huppert around on the floor before more or less raping her almost lifeless body in its blood-splashed nightgown. She lies there numb while he makes some stupid remarks about this being what she wanted. Then he leaves her flat. I won't give away the climactic scene.That first half is very good, though, partly because there are some satisfying snatches of classical music -- Bach and some others but most Schubert. Some of today's younger audiences might expect to be intimidated, bored, or both -- but would they be right? That same demographic swallowed painlessly through a number of Stanley Kubrick's movies that featured both Strausses plus Beethoven. Not to mention ""Amadeus."" And, throughout, both Huppert and Girardot are unimpeachable.",The Piano Teacher
7,dbdumonteil,a few notches below the usual Michael Haneke production,5,26 March 2006,"Michael Haneke is one of the most innovative filmmakers of these last years and he must be given credit to take contemporary cinema in new territories. In a handful of films all disturbing which shatter our consciences and with a recognizable trademark, he created his own universe, a formidable one in which it is dangerous to venture. Like the greatest auteur, Haneke has his set of themes. Most of his films revolve around the alienation of the individual in the current western world in which comfort and modernity can lead him to the loss of his identity, even his physical or psychological destruction (""der Siebente Kontinente"" 1989 ""Benny's Video"" 1992). The way violence has become a common feature in everyday life in an insensible society (""Funny Games"" 1997), absence of love and communication in a God-forsaken world are also recurrent witnesses which run throughout Haneke's work. It seems that his latest opus, ""Caché"" (2005) is his most accomplished movie. It was a triumph on all levels and I have only read virtually unanimously glowing critics. It also garnered a bucketful of prizes and awards in Europe. Four years earlier, awards also rained on ""la Pianiste"" which like ""Caché"" received paeans of praise... maybe wrongly from my own standpoint. Derived from a novel, I do not think that it is on a par with Haneke's previous works. It's a let-down after a so far immaculate career.Coming after the fragmented ""Code Inconnu: Récits Incomplets De Divers Voyages"" (2000) which encompassed nearly all Haneke's quoted obsessions, ""la Pianiste"" is a return to a more accessible, linear form like ""Funny Games"" but once again not for all tastes given the murky even grisly contents of the film. But it's not necessarily a better one. A reading of the synopsis lets see why the director was highly interested with his topic: a 45 year-old maid who is a piano teacher and who lives under under her possessive mother's thumb. She only finds as a way out to flee from her sultry household the outings in peep-shows and porn cinemas. The Austrian director studied psychology in Wien in the sixties so it seemed that the story of this neurotic upper-class person was tailor-made for him. It was apparently a perilous task to render this novel on the screen because from Haneke's own words, several passages came within pornography. But fortunately, these passages are very subdued when they are transfered on the screen.Haneke remains faithful to his hallmarks. Although his devotees will have perhaps noticed that his obsessions, here take a back seat except maybe in the sequences when Annie Girardot intervenes. Indeed, she spends most of her time glued in front of the telly, the telly, a cursed object in Herr Haneke's universe. Here, one could argue that the telly only contributes to cement Girardot's domination on her daughter. Haneke also uses his static, clinical style again to describe and assess in a hard-hitting way, the mournful, loveless life of Erika Kohut with sometimes evocative colors. The blood which flows in the bathroom after a scene of self-mutilation on her genital parts underscores Erika's psychological wounds.In a way, what makes the strength of the film also constitutes its main drawback. I'm far from being an expert at psychology but it seems incompatible to me that Erika can be a brilliant piano teacher while being systematically over-protected by her mother in spite of her key-sentence: ""you must be the best piano teacher in the world my girl"". Maybe would it have been more cohesive to introduce a character with a not so prestigious professional situation. But on the other hand, Erika's voyeuristic side and her secret attendances of porn cinemas seem logical with her persona and it's a neat idea from Haneke to have included classical music in the screening sessions. But the irregularity I mentioned handicaps a major part of the film and what doesn't help matters is that the second half which is more centered on the sadistic love affair between Erika and Walter (Benoît Magimel) is rather undermined by overlong sequences with some filler. Hence, this feeling that the film never seems to end.Part of the disappointment also comes from the cast. Maybe it was a mistake to have hired celebrities. In Haneke's previous pieces of works, actors were unknown of the mainstream (except maybe for the German and Austrian public) and contributed to the filmmaker's unique universe, even if ""Code Inconnu"" had Juliette Binoche. Hats off to Isabelle Huppert who agreed to play such a demeaning part. Anyway, she would act the same type of character with startling results in the highly superior ""8 Femmes"" (2002) by François Ozon. But Annie Girardot's part is underwritten. She didn't deserve her César in 2002. Haneke had thought of Jeanne Moreau for this part, I wonder what she would have done with it. Her possessive, pervasive presence isn't potent, destructive enough to give her the image of a monstrous mother. Worse, she's sometimes wasted in the way she's badly used. In one of the most famous images of the film, she's held by Huppert and Magimel as she's screaming. In the grievous scene, she's locked on a room and her cries make the moment unintentionally funny! As for Benoît Magimel, his persona doesn't articulate itself very well with the posh, cold universe in which the film bathes. His prize for best actor in Cannes in 2001 is very disputable.I don't want to slate Haneke's film. It's not a winner, neither is it a despicable work. I can't find in it the ""something"" which elevated the bulk of his work to undebatable heights.",The Piano Teacher
8,Quinoa1984,up there with 'Last Tango' as a truly disturbing work of sexual horror,8,12 May 2008,"Michael Haneke, it's easy to say, is one sick puppy. Between the three films I've seen of his- Funny Games (US), Cache and now The Piano Teacher- he's certainly not a director to make his films boring. This is to his credit as a provocateur more-so than as a genuine art-house/Euro talent; his work is a kin to giving you a swift kick in the nuts, giving a tid-bit of ice for the wound, and then having you watching in eager anticipation for the next event to come. It didn't work for Funny Games very well, and for Cache it worked at almost masterful levels. For the Piano Teacher, which may be the most disturbing of Europe's crop of psycho-sexual dramas of the decade, deals out its main character as something between a side character in Barry Lyndon and, well, your local cold-fish of a teacher at school, but it's not a cold movie, per-say.Rather, The Piano Teacher never moves its gaze from its characters movements or actions, usually going right with the action without 'flashy' turns, and the only music coming out of those luminous numbers from Schubert and, oddly enough, that one numbner from Barry Lyndon. And at the center of Haneke's torrid drama is Isabele Hupert in the title role, playing a woman who still lives with her mother (one of the most fascinating things for me in the film, something that adds a whole other level of the psychological tension, perverseness), and rarely has a good word to say about anyone's musical ability. Least of all for the young man (played very well by Benoit Magnimel), who has an affinity for Schubert and finds something in this teacher he wants to know more; he pursues the poisition of student very much despite being rejected by her. But then they meet again, in a manner that is so deranged I dare not mention it here (let's just say it's a manner of horrible, unforgivable ""payback"" that says all that needs to be said about Hupert's insecurities).Like Last Tango in Paris, the sexual congress is intense, rough, and uncompromising for what many of us consider practical, loving contact. These characters- in Haneke's universe probably more- are driven by obsessive needs and something they can't express, and ironically, when Hupert puts her thoughts and desires all out there in ""un-poetic"" writing, it becomes the Achilles heel. There's a lot that Haneke explores here that sparks interest, and I found myself thinking about the ideas and the cold look of Hupert (one that, showing how great she is in the part, you keep looking for the slightest change of the guard) and why it didn't totally knock me off my feet... Maybe it did, in a manner of speaking. By the end of the film, which concludes perhaps logically if somewhat randomly, I was shocked and appalled, but I also knew I had seen something powerful and challenging to boot. How do we contemplate these characters that are seemingly the everyday sort but are dark and depraved and wanting something from someone that they can't get? In short, The Piano Teacher works best as a tale of loss, I suppose, or of never having it in the first place.",The Piano Teacher
9,jotix100,Klavier sonata,8,24 March 2006,"Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the start of the film, we see her arriving home late. When her older mother protests, Erika goes into a frenzy, attacking the older woman without pity. Erika, as it turns out, is a musical teacher of a certain renown in the conservatory where she teaches. When we next see her, she is the model of composure, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels he is wasting his time, and hers. The same goes for the insecure Anna, a talented girl who Erika hates, maybe because she sees in the young woman a promise that she is not willing to promote.At the end of the day, we watch Erika as she goes into an amusement area and proceeds to one of the cabins where pornographic material is shown. Erika is transfixed as she watches the things that are being performed on the screen. On another occasion, Erika comes to a drive-in where a movie is in progress. Her attention goes toward a parked car in which, two lovers are performing a sex act. The camera lingers on Erika as she is lost in reverie watching what the two lovers are doing, until she is surprised by the young man inside the car. Erika flees horrified she's been discovered.When a wealthy couple invites Erika to perform in a recital in their opulent home, she meets an eager young man, Walter, who is related to the hosts. Walter is immediately taken with Erika's playing; the young man is a talented pianist himself. His eagerness to compliment Erika is met with skepticism on her part. Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class, and is accepted.Thus begins Walter pursuit of Erika, who is taken aback when she realizes what the young man's motives really are. In turn, Erika, begins to fantasize about Walter in ways that only her mind could, imagining what she would like him do when, and if, they get together. Walter gets turned off by the letter Erika has written to him, detailing sexual acts that are repugnant to the young man.The film's ending, reminded us of the last sequence of Mr. Haneke's current ""Cache"". We are taken to a concert hall where Erika is going to perform. She is seen stalking the lobby looking for the arrival of Walter, who goes on into the hall without noticing her. Erika's expression to the camera reveals a lot more of her state of mind in that last minutes of the film. As she flees the lobby area after inflicting a wound on herself, the camera abandons her and concentrates on the building's facade that seems to stay on the screen for a long time.""La Pianiste"" is a personal triumph for Isabelle Huppert. This magnificent actress does one of her best appearances on the screen, guided by the sure hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Ms. Huppert's works with economic gestures, yet, she projects so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika.The supporting cast does wonders under the director's guidance. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as Erika's mother. She seems to be the key of whatever went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest that is played with subtleness in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel is perfectly cast as Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the film as the young man, so in love with a woman that is possessed by demons, that he'll never be able to chase away or get her to love him in a normal manner.Michael Haneke films are always disturbing to watch, yet they offer so many rewards because he dares to go where other men don't. The magnificent music heard in the film are mainly by Schubert and Schumann, two composers that are Erika's own favorites. The movie is helped tremendously by Christian Berger's cinematography.",The Piano Teacher
10,lastliberal,How I hate my mother.,8,19 October 2007,"Why is it that Freud was always talking about hating your father? Mommies do the best job of screwing you up, and Erica's (Isabelle Huppert) mom is a doozy.Huppert can always be counted upon to give an incredible performance, and she is superb here in the painful-to-watch film. She is carrying an incredible amount of psychological baggage, and it really affects her emotionless life. She is looking for love, but only finds seduction. Part of the problem is hers as she has no concept of what love is. She has a warped sense of S&M that she supposes is love, but when faced with reality, she is shocked and cold.I should warn you that the ending is certainly unconventional, but the film is unconventional as well, so it fits.",The Piano Teacher
11,Boba_Fett1138,A beautiful movie about some ugly things.,8,20 January 2012,"Really, I'm not just a Michael Haneke gusher, that likes everything he does but when a movie is good it is simply good! But like basically all Michael Haneke movies, it's not for just everyone. It's really a matter of taste, whether you like this movie or not. It's a movie with a very own approach to its heavy story but as far as Michael Haneke movies go, this one is actually still pretty straightforward with its storytelling. It's always simple to follow and the movie mostly lays out everything for you, so you don't have a lot of blanks to fill in for yourself.Still the story itself will be a bit too much for some people to handle. It's really about something awful and disgusting but yet I really can't help myself but to be deeply intrigued by this movie.It's all about the movie its style and the way the story is slowly being told by director Michael Haneke and its actors. It's what makes the movie a great watch, as well as a real intriguing one. The movie and its story probably work out great and intriguing because it is about something unusual and something you are not likely to see being handled often in a movie.It's a story about extreme sexual repression and what happens when someone finally gets together with someone of the opposite sex. Repulst by love and probably also by herself, a 40-something years old piano teacher uses one of her students, that pursues her, to fulfill her odd sadomasochistic fantasies. But how far is he truly willing to go for her and exactly who controls who? You could say that the movie turns into a sexual thriller, that you can't ever really predict. The events are unpredictable as well as all of the characters. It gives the movie, an almost constantly present feeling, of tension.It's a real accomplishment, by both cast and crew, that this movie about some odd and ugly things and characters, still remains such a beautiful and engaging movie to watch. It's simply storytelling and filmmaking at its best, though it's obviously not a movie for just everybody.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Piano Teacher
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Spellbinding,8,14 May 2014,"Being a piano teacher in a school isn't necessarily the most compelling job. Erika(Huppert, disappearing into the role) lives with her overbearing mother(Girardot, fleshing out what in the hands of a lesser talent would have been one-sided), who keeps close tabs on her. Both of them are single, lonely, missing the father, and feeling they've achieved what they could in their lives. She always retains control even when not the only authority(even in that situation, she doesn't ""give"" any), keeps her distance, doesn't smile, and claims to have no emotion. Her love of the music, that we are at times given rich explanations of, fits with her personality, and vice versa - clear rules for what is right and what is wrong, intelligent and reserved, refusing to cater to the masses. But she does have violent fantasies, and when she meets the young enthusiast of the classics Walter(Magimel, fantastic, holding his own against a woman 20 years his senior), she may be able to live them out - even if doing so poses great risks to herself.This is gripping from start to finish. It is not for everyone, and I mean no offense to those who aren't in the intended audience. There are a lot of long takes with few people in the shot, a lot of silence, few cuts or close-ups, little in the way of movement of the camera, and largely basic angles and compositions. It's driven by the acting and dialog(with many mean, even cruel, lines, to an extent equally divided between the leads - there is no room for failure in the perfectionist world of performing arts that require that much talent, nor is there a way to impress, at most, be thought to be ""good enough""). There are no real plot twists, merely a spiral towards the inevitable awful outcome. This sets up some themes and characters, and explores them, thoroughly. Our protagonist has no make-up, and this is an example of this not holding back, not covering up imperfections, it is bare and harsh, and all the better for it. This is only the second film of Michael Haneke I've watched, the other being The White Ribbon, but I love both of them, and will be seek out more of his work.This goes into selfishness vs. sacrifice, disgust vs. understanding, complete acceptance vs. unrepentant rejection, what is proper and what is not. Add to that the way the world of yesterday's ""sensual"" (in direct contact with, not theory but talent for playing, composing) love of art being shoved aside by, and for the sake of, modern intellectualism(study of theory) and crowd-pleasers such as sports. Most of all, it is about sado-masochism. This goes into that subject without misrepresenting(unlike 50 Shades of Grey) and free of judgment. It is, however, deeply unsettling, showing the negatives that can come from it, whilst clearly showing that they aren't inherent to it. When it isn't practiced in a healthy relationship based on trust, where the partners use safe-words, consent and aftercare. Because when someone has suppressed something for the longest time, it can be an explosion when the faucet is finally turned on. We see how the greatest perversity may be borne of the strongest repressive environment, and that just because one's sexuality has not been expressed, doesn't mean it's gone.This contains a near-constant tension, mostly regarding disturbing content, a lot of sexuality, some of it graphic and/or violent. It is a movie that is sometimes arousing, other times revolting, one that dares you to look on yet is impossible to take your eyes off. I recommend this to everyone who is not put off by the subject nor the unflinching approach to it. 8/10",The Piano Teacher
13,Sylviastel,Missed the Ending's Point!,9,12 March 2011,"The Piano Lesson is based on Nobel Laureate Elfriede Jelinek's book of the same name. I didn't read the book but I am curious to read it. The story is about a mature piano instructor played beautifully by the French actress, Isabelle Huppert. She lives with her mother in a small Vienna apartment. The character of Erika, the piano teacher, slowly unwinds as her need for love and control intertwine in her life. She meets Walter Kemmler, a young handsome hockey player student, who changes her life and offers her a chance at some pretty repulsive sexuality. Despite her appearance as a prim and proper piano teacher, she harbors deep sexual desires towards bondage and masochism in which she wants her students to fulfill. Her relationship with her mother is even more bizarre at one point in the film. This film is not easy to watch at times and don't expect a happy ending but it's a great French film in looking at the psyche of a trouble woman.",The Piano Teacher

15,JamesHitchcock,Little of Substance beneath the Darkness,4,15 January 2014,"Although  ""The Piano Teacher"" is a French film with dialogue in French, it is set in Austria, based on a novel by an Austrian writer (Elfriede Jelinek) and directed by an Austrian-born director, Michael Haneke. The original French title of this film was ""La Pianiste"" which literally means ""The Pianist"", as does Jelinek's title ""Die Klavierspielerin"". This title was not, however, used in English, doubtless to avoid confusion with Roman Polanski's film of that name. The main character is Erika Kohut, a professional pianist and a piano professor at a Vienna music conservatory. Outwardly Erika is a reserved, repressed and puritanical individual. Although she is already in her forties she still lives at home with her elderly, domineering mother; the two even share the same bed. We never see Erika's g father but learn that he is incarcerated in a psychiatric asylum. There is, however, a hidden side to her personality, first revealed when we see her acting as a Peeping Tom, spying on courting couples at a drive-in cinema. More of this hidden side is revealed when Erika begins a sexual relationship with a good-looking young pupil, Walter Klemmer. Although Walter is physically attracted to his teacher, he is repelled by her sadomasochistic tendencies, which leads to a curious love-hate relationship growing up between them. Erika's speciality as a pianist is Schumann and Schubert; Schubert's music plays a particularly important part in the film. This struck me as very appropriate, as his music has always struck me, like that of Mozart, as being full of emotion but hiding it behind a veil of reserve, in contrast to the much more openly emotional and Romantic music of slightly later composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner. I felt, however, that the film rather pandered to the Hollywood myth of Schubert as a shy, ugly little man who poured into his music all the emotions he could not express in life; in reality he seems to have been a successful womaniser, even though he was far from handsome. Isabelle Huppert is often compelling, and Annie Girardot is also good as Erika's witch-like mother, but this is not a film I cared for. In what is supposedly a character study far too much is left unexplained, such as the incident in which Erika deliberately injures one of her female students by putting broken glass in her coat pocket. In the violent sexual encounters between Erika and Walter it is never made clear whether he is abusing her or merely pandering to her masochistic tendencies. Haneke (who acted as scriptwriter as well as director) might think that this distinction does not matter, but I felt that it was very relevant to an understanding of Erika's character. ""The Piano Teacher"" seems to have been intended as a dark, disturbing psychological study, but I found that it did not do much to explain Erika's behaviour except in terms of that old get-out ""sexual repression""; there are doubtless many people who are sexually repressed, but most of them do not behave in the same way as Erika, who appears to be verging on the criminally insane. ""The Piano Teacher"" may be dark and disturbing, but it disturbs us to no good purpose and hides little of substance beneath its darkness. Having been greatly impressed by Haneke's more recent ""The White Ribbon"", I was very disappointed by this film. 4/10",The Piano Teacher
16,=G=,"A disturbing, dark character study with powerful performances",8,6 November 2002,"""The Piano Teacher"" is all about Huppert's character; a middle-aged classical piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which lurks a powerfully compelling aberrant personality. Unsatisfying as a story but intriguing as a character study, the film follows the Huppert character through the term of her anguished relationship with a pupil delivering superb performances in the process. Not for everyone, ""The Piano Teacher"" will play best with those into foreign films and character-driven dramas dealing with dark issues. (A-)",The Piano Teacher
17,secondtake,"Schubert, indeed--the mind and libido over 88 keys",7,7 October 2012,"The Piano Teacher (2001)This is a difficult movie. It's difficult to watch at times, if you take it seriously. But I think it was difficult to film, to write, to act. The premise is subtle even if it sounds sensational--show the inner mind and inner life of a brilliant woman who is mentally ill. She has compulsive issues, I think, and sexual repression that has led her to masochistic and finally sadistic extremes. She is admirable in some external way for her self-control which reads, to an outsider, as cold precision, the kind needed to be an extraordinary classical pianist.But the movie takes us inside her life, first to the unhealthy relationship with her mother, then the oddly stern and indifferent role she takes with her advanced students. Finally there is a young man who sees only her ability, and her external beauty. (This woman, Erika, is played by the incomparable Isabelle Huppert.) He is a pianist of unusual talent, but he wants not to concertize, but to live life. He plays hockey. He has friends. He smiles warmly. He is, in short, a healthy normal and rather handsome young man.And he falls for Erika. This is where the movie gets weirder and weirder, but also more challenging. They play an intense game of sexual chicken, at first, and lots of head games. He knows she's superior to him in some way--older, more severe---but he has no idea about her slanted view of life and of sex. He wants her. He becomes a pupil of hers just for that reason. She pretends not to care, or to rebuff him (in part this isn't pretense because she's afraid). Finally a couple of serious and demented confrontations occur. And things unravel in a very interesting way. Some people will find it simply sick and unwatchable. It also happens very slowly--if the film has an obvious flaw, it's the pace. It's in love with itself far too much. But if you get into that flow, and can take the pain that will rise up, then you will at least be greatly affected. That's more than most movies can say.It's all quite in ernest. I don't think it's a bit campy or playing games with the viewer. It's really trying to get at this woman's psyche--and the young man's, since he gets in deeper than he intended. It's filmed with terrific planning and visual panache. And it makes some kind of deranged sense, too. In fact, there are probably more people in these kinds of situations than I'll even know, and to them I say give this a careful look.",The Piano Teacher

I was hoping that the characters Erika and Walter were going to live happily ever after but instead, it was like a battlefield. To be honest with you, the films poster tells you that they are in love with each other and not beating each other to bits! I really thought they should've developed Erika's character even more because, she acted like such a dope in saying no to love. You could see it in his eyes that Walter cared about her but yet, she keeps refusing and whines that she deserves pain. Such a crybaby. I even hated near the end when Walter beat her up but like, why the hell did she have to get involved with a young man? What made the pair of them so attracted to each other? Yknow if I compared Fifty Shades of Grey to this movie, I would say that both are equally as bad as each other!",The Piano Teacher

Their relationship has its ups and downs and the fact that she lives with her mother who is very strict creates more problems.I did not know what to expect from this movie but I was surprised by the interpretation of Isabelle Huppert who played as Erika Kohut the piano teacher. She was simply outstanding and I believe that her interpretation made the difference. The plot was simple but interesting with no much of suspense but full of mystery and plot twists that I could not expect or predict. Regarding the direction which was made by Michael Haneke, it was good and he created a mysterious atmosphere, something that made his movie even more interesting. Finally, I have to say that ""The Piano Teacher"" is a nice movie but I can understand those who did not like it because it is not meant to be for everyone.",The Piano Teacher
20,johnnyboyz,"This is a brilliant and near-flawless account of two people coming together and sharing something so beautiful, yet so ugly, that one struggles to praise it enough.",8,8 February 2012,"The Piano Teacher is quite the jump from that of its maker's last film. In comparison, Michael Haneke's Code Unknown darted off all over the place on one too many-a strand to keep it either particularly interesting nor necessarily be able the work of magic his twisting; turning and brilliant The Piano Teacher most certainly does. Told linearly, and with one central strand upon which the director is able to apply his ability, this love story of sorts, unrequited or otherwise, doubles up as a searing drama refusing to rely on multi-equilibriumed; would-be thematically-bound character pieces utilising a broad number of people, languages and situations to get across a sense of scope and instead zeroes in on a chapter in one young man's life and an even more harrowing one in another older woman's. It is frightening how easy Haneke makes the material he takes on here look; devilish how he works the set premise around hairpin bends and unnerving in its general use of juxtapositions and black comedy.Central to proceedings is Isabelle Huppert's Erika Kohut, an Austrian woman of around forty who works at a Vienna piano school tutoring pupils in the art of playing said instrument. By day, Erika will occupy small rooms in the local piano school shrouded by the grayish ambiance of the Vienna locale, something wonderfully captured by Austrian director of photography Christian Berger in one of the few fleeting moments Haneke permits us an outdoor sequence and room to breath in this stifling film about a series of stifling relationships built on power; control and restriction. On the walls, of which radiate with this disturbing bright glow of white, proudly sit portraits of composers and classical musicians of times gone by in what is the only instance of any sort of decor in the place as they sit there watching on from their alleviated position.In spite of being a bit of a task master, verbally berating students when they make a hash of a note during a symphony and mercilessly striking from the page once with her peers when the time comes to analyse who's hot and who's not those in-between term time, she too exists under a vice-like grip of authority and carefully preordained regimentation when we observe she lives with her mother. In an early scene, we witness Erika return home late at night and take precautions to conceal a revealing top that she has been wearing by hiding it in her bag before she faces that of her lone parent. Aside from these traits, Haneke leaps from both content and a general sense of mise-en-scene to both content and a general sense of mise-en-scene as starkly and as strikingly as sadism is different to masochism – techniques wholly evident when it's revealed Erika actually has a side to her more inclined to enjoying victimisation and humiliation.This sense of Erika controlling and both being controlled in respective home and work orientated locales is prominent with her dismissing of her pupils but bowing to slight parental demands. What upsets the balance in her life, and comes to form the nucleus of the film's runtime, is a tryst she has with that of a young man named Walter Klemmer; an athletic, somewhat spontaneous and rather gifted piano player himself who's quite brilliantly played by Benoît Magimel. In Klemmer, workplace and home-set roles for Erika become blurred. The natural procession for the woman to control at school and then be controlled away from it sees her submissive desires become more apparent through Klemmer, whom she only really sees at her workplace, with her controlling characteristics later becoming more evident at home in reaction to her mother's take on what transpires.This sense of shaping up against one another is evident from early on in their relationship, Erika and her mother forcing the young man to take the stairs when they occupy the elevator up to one of the top floors of the piano school thus forcing him into working a sweat as he rises to the challenge of matching their somewhat pseudo-evident demands. When Erika and Klemmer first become acquainted, he ends up rather thoroughly playing a contingency piece without much in the way of aid and his fulfilling of this duty is captured around Erika's own gaze as these characteristics omitted by one of her students pulling through and refusing to be controlled carrying with it an eroticised surge. Where Erika seems to be able, indeed enjoys, controlling and bossing around her one-to-one students in their playing of the piano, a point is made to linger on such an instance before permitting Klemmer entrance to her studio for the first time so that he may play; answer back and match her at her own forté.The film's crux is in how Klemmer, brought into Erika's world, will react to the odes of bondage and discipline Erika wishes to instill into their already functioning relationship. If Klemmer is a young, athletic, heterosexual Aryan and a somewhat cocksure young male specimen living a familiarised existence of looking for sexual intercourse out of relationships with the opposite sex, what of his attempted applied descent, instigated by that of others, into a generalised realm often shunned or frowned upon by the rest of society conforming to pain and controlled abuse as a means of release? Haneke's hypothesis, on top of the said ideas to do with the two stark existence's the protagonist leads, makes for a supremely rewarding character drama – it is more focused than that of Code Unknown; more mature than that of Shainberg's ""Secretary"", in which fetishism was essentially introduced as something worth no more than being the continual butt of an indie-spirited joke engaged in by complete kooks, and is most certainly worth one's time.",The Piano Teacher

Other than these attributes, I could not find any redeeming value in it.)Buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth.

Plus lots of protracted scenes (in spite of my love for classical music and several years of piano studies) and dull ending.As for the performances, the strongest ones were provided by Isabelle Huppert (as Erika Kohut) and Annie Girardot as her mother. Benoît Magimel was too old for the role of 17-years old Walter Klemmer (he was 26 already during the shooting); moreover, why were the French necessary to portray Austrians?!If you like films like The Swan (many similarities) or The Piano, then La Pianiste is for you as well.

My expectations were not met as I was heavily disappointed with this film as primarily all the three French actors were not properly used. To begin with Isabelle Huppert is a big miscast as the cold,lonely music teacher.This role could have been nicely done by Hanna Schygulla. Why ? As a German actress she would have surely had better affinity with Michael Haneke who is an Austrian author.Even the role given to the veteran actress of the past Annie Girardot looks unconvincing as she never fits in such kind of troubled mother mold.The biggest error is related to Benoit Magimel's character. This is because he is more at home in demonstrating his acting talents related to psychological aspects of French films. As I have not read the books by Elfriede Jelinek,I don't think that it would be fair on my part to comment on the book's cinematographic adaptation. All in all, I have no hesitation in saying that I have failed to grasp the very the essence of this film.

25,Chris_Docker,"A great film it may be, but mainstream viewing it is not.",8,11 November 2001,"In the first twenty minutes we are swept away by several powerfully portrayed emotions: a suffocating and overbearing mother has a violent argument with her live-in 40yr old daughter; a piano teacher (and professor of music)'s love for her pupils expressed in unswerving critical appraisal; the joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer. Within this short space of time our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very real characters. We are also swept away by powerfully performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance. Such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of widespread appeal. But the trend in French cinema being what it is, it goes deeper, exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction, and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are drawn to her suffering and, at least initially, wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius, particularly in the composers she admires. The Piano Teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch. The scenes are essential to the dilemmas which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called gratuitous. A great film it may be, but mainstream viewing it is not.",The Piano Teacher

She shone in a same way in the critically acclaimed Madame Bovary with equally superb performance.The ending scene was a little incomprehensible, that maybe needs more deep thinking on the part of viewers.Michael Haneke always shocks viewers in his movies with various degrees of emotional elements and the thought-provoking The Piano Teacher is no exception to the rule.",The Piano Teacher

First I was thinking this shows why students shouldn't go to obsessive music conservatories rather than general liberal arts colleges. Then I was thinking about an article I read this week in ""The Chronicle of Higher Education"" about how more and more colleges are establishing codes of conduct for teacher/student relationships and boy this school could use one.Then I was just relieved that at least the hunky student (Benoit Magimel) breathed some sanity, fresh air and old-fashioned, enthusiastic lust into the movie for awhile and I, wow, sided with him against beautiful, twisted martinet professor Isabelle Hupert, and with him too against her extremely controlling mother (Annie Girardot), as he in effect became the mature teacher in the relationship. As the whole audience got more and more disgusted (literally), one guy tried to claim this was really a metaphor for hypocritical politicians, but we all pretty much snorted at him.There could be a socially redeeming feminist theme here somewhere (as when the macho hockey players chase the delicate figure skaters off the ice rink over which Huppert later escapes a disastrous sexual encounter), a la Catherine Breillat's sexually brutal films, but director Michael Haneke adapted it with the novelist Elfriede Jelinek.(originally written 4/6/2002)",The Piano Teacher
28,EVOL666,Another Winner From Michael Haneke...,8,29 December 2006,"Although I've never rated any of Michael Haneke's films as ""masterpieces"" (at least of the ones I've seen...) - I do feel that he is a masterful director who is very good at creating cold, calculated, and somewhat ""shocking"" films that are almost casual in their portrayals of violence, perversity, and the callousness of humankind. THE PIANO TEACHER is no different, and is one of the more solid Haneke films.THE PIANO TEACHER delves into the life of a dry and controlling (you guessed it...) piano teacher. She is very cold in her work with her students and in her daily routines, and lives with her over-bearing mother who tries to control her every move. As the story goes on though - we find that Ms. Uptight-and-Dry piano teacher is also a bit of a freaky-deaky. Seems she likes to go into peep-show booths and sniff used jizz-rags while watching porn loops. Eventually she is pursued by a young and talented pianist and the teacher lets him in on her secret desires to be severely dominated. This puts the young man off, but the two have an attraction that continually brings them together. Eventually the young man gives the teacher exactly the sort of treatment she asked for, but when he does, it doesn't seem to be much to her liking...THE PIANO TEACHER seems to tackle many themes - mainly the sexual power-plays between men and women, but to the highest degree and using ""extreme"" sexual fetishes as the measuring-point. Control is passed back and forth between the teacher and student on several occasions, resulting in some harrowing conclusions. Eventually we find that after experiencing the sort of treatment she so yearned for, the teacher may not have really thought through the consequences of her desires - and on the other hand, the young man who initially wanted no parts of her depraved games found himself playing along willingly once he ""got into"" it.Haneke's direction is strong and voyeuristic as usual, and has a knack for making the audience uncomfortable - even while showing very little graphically in his films. I find this to be the mark of a truly great director. Though I tend to gravitate towards gory and graphic cinema - Haneke is a director whose works I always seek out and admire for their under-stated ""shock-value"". There are things that I don't particularly love about his films - oftentimes the endings are a bit obscure (as in this film...), but every one of Haneke's films that I've seen (FUNNY GAMES, BENNY'S VIDEO, CACHE, CODE UNKNOWN, THE SEVENTH CONTINENT, and now this one) has been a worthwhile view and has far more positive aspects than negative.

30,Galina_movie_fan,Powerful and Disturbing,9,18 October 2007,"After I saw ""La Pianiste"" several years ago, I said to myself that I would never see it again, so powerful and disturbing it was. Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book ""The Piano Teacher"" by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as ""Le Pianiste"". Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's Piano music, ""soaked in the morbid humanity"", is another bright star of the movie.I only have one problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character comparing to the novel. In the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to Walter, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her, was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course, Huppert was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.",The Piano Teacher
31,philip_vanderveken,Not exactly a romantic movie the way Hollywood sees it.,7,3 April 2005,"""La Pianiste"" or ""The Piano Player"" in English isn't exactly what you could call a feel good movie. Perhaps the best way to describe it is to call it a hard, raw, uncensored and realistic view on the life of a woman who isn't exactly what you would expect of her if you would meet her for the first time. I know that sounds a bit mysterious, but much will be explained if you read the next paragraph...The movie is about a female piano instructor at a famous music conservatory in Vienna, who is highly respected for her talent and discipline. But she isn't the nicest of people. She's an arrogant ice queen and unforgiving towards her students, but in the meantime she is also very submissive towards her mother, with whom she lives (and sleeps), because she doesn't have a husband or a lover. Because she hasn't got a man in her life she satisfies her sexual appetites by watching extreme porn videos, by voyeurism and masturbation and sometimes even by self-mutilation. When she finds out that one of her students is in love with her, she starts some kind of sexual relationship with him. But she never wants to fully satisfy him until he gives her all control over the relationship. When he finds out that S&M, pain and humiliation are part of her sexual fantasies, he first runs away from her, but soon returns and gives in on her demands. The only thing that I don't really understand is why this movie gets the label ""adult"" on this website. Sure, for a few seconds you'll see a part of a porn movie that doesn't leave much to the imagination, but that's a part of this woman's personality and wasn't added just because of the sex. A movie like ""Lucía y el sexo"" had a lot more sex in it and that one is called a romantic drama. No, when I think of adult movies, than I think of porn movies, not of movies like this one.As I already said before, this is a hard movie and certainly not for those who are used to watch the average romantic Hollywood film. They will almost certainly not like it, even though the classical music in the soundtrack sometimes makes it all a bit more bearable. Neverthelles, this is an interesting film and to make things short I want to conclude by saying that it isn't perhaps a 'fun' movie to watch, but it is good cinema with some very good acting in it. That's why I give this movie a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10.",The Piano Teacher

The protagonist just kept getting weirder and weirder.  She had so many emotional conflicts that I was exhausted by them long before the end.I have to admire Isabelle Huppert for taking on this difficult role - can you imagine what it was like to film some of those scenes?  However, she is at her best when she is seen sitting quietly listening to music; her facial expressions say more than words.The movie is closely miked.  You pick up every little rustle of clothes, closing of doors, shuffling of feet, and so forth.  I don't know why, but I found this effective.  And time is taken to linger over scenes, allowing you to digest a bit before moving on. The film depicts the complexity of human behavior. You never know what is going on underneath the surface of anybody, even a seemingly cultured and intelligent woman.  Or, maybe, particularly a cultured and intelligent woman.  The movie encourages you not to take people at face value, but probe and observe before forming an opinion (or suggesting that they be committed).",The Piano Teacher
33,stensson,"Strong, almost too strong",8,26 April 2002,"This is a picture, not made because somebody wants money, but because somebody wants film. A real film this is, that demands something from the viewer and there you can't be sure to stand what you'll see, although you've probably seen lots of worse violence than this.This is a picture about strong and dark feelings. Some would say everybody have them, but I personally very much doubt it. That's not really interesting here. Your commitment to these people and their problems will get very big, almost too big. And you can't be sure of what will happen in the end.Isabelle Hubert is splendid and indeed a most courageous actress. This picture is not easy to watch, prepare yourself to be sick, even if you can take some violence and even hardcore scenes.

34,DeeNine-2,Featuring a stunning performance by Isabelle Huppert,10,4 December 2005,"If it is true that sadomasochism is a two-sided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites, then the cinematic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality. Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself. Her outward expression projects her desire. That is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.Along comes talented, charming, handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity. He wants to become her student so as to be close to her. She rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the Vienna conservatory votes him in. He falls in love with her. Again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist? It is hard to tell. Is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. She is a sex extreme freak. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. Actually that isn't even true. She says she doesn't care what others think. She doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. Love, she calls it. For her sex and love are one and the same.At one point Walter tells her that love isn't everything. How ironic such a superfluity is to her. How gratuitous the comment.The movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find Erika within). He also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another. This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone. Here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery. We don't need to see any more.The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them. I have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul. Like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What matters to her is the performance and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No character too depraved. It's as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does. She is always fascinating and nearly flawless. She is not merely a leading light of the French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.I think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentellière) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. There she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. Her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets. (Hollywood could never make a movie like this.) In the American cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty. Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La Cérémonie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.Do see this for Isabelle Huppert. You won't forget her or the character she brings to life.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

35,TheUnknown837-1,It is hard for me to express my aesthetic admiration of this picture without coming across as a total sicko,9,9 March 2012,"I don't think there's a socially respectable person in the world who would say that Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher"" is a good time. If there is, I don't want to meet that person. This is a film so twisted and uncomfortable that it would send the sadomasochistic characters of David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" running for the hills. And yet at the same time, unpleasant and disturbing as it is, the film is also a very powerful piece of psychological study. Yes, it is as messed-up and off-putting as its protagonist, but it's also fascinating.The said protagonist is a sexually repressed pianist played by the wonderful French actress Isabelle Huppert. She glides into her perverted character so easily that one wonders if and how much she messed herself up in real life to do it so well. Dodging her bossy mother's questions and peeping, she spends her days denouncing and bemocking her students and her evenings stepping into porno booths and, in one of the film's most shocking scenes, peeking around drive-ins, hoping to catch somebody coupling in the backseat. Everything, most of all her psychological state, comes crashing down when she takes on a talented new pupil (Benoit Magimel) who has romantic designs on her. Only he doesn't realize just what kind of a sick, twisted monster he has taken a shine to.""The Piano Teacher"" is two hours of sheer disgust. Those with weak stomachs steer clear. For two hours it astonished me, repelled me, and made my stomach flip and turn inside of me. The characters - every single one of them - are entirely unsympathetic. Even the mother, wonderfully acted by the late Annie Girardot, is hardly the straight-arrow she tries to make herself out to be. The one and only time that I placed myself in the shoes of a character was when one turned to Miss Huppert after one of her masochistic rants, and plainly told her ""You are sick. You need help."" And yet all she does in cause pain and displeasure to others, and to herself, and we are left to watch and see just how far she can really go.""The Piano Teacher"" is not a good movie-going experience and I would probably be happy never seeing it again. It's too rough-going. So why am I still recommending the movie, and so highly? Because, for that one viewing, it commanded my attention and left me fascinated by what I was seeing why I was being simultaneously disgusted. It's like studying a pathologically sick individual, except that you are able to observe from a safe distance. And there is no safer distance than a movie screen. For those who admire psychology - and I most certainly do - it is a compelling experience as well as nasty one. It is also one of those pictures, whether or not you have seen a sadism or masochism on the screen before, you might never want to see it again.It is hard to express my aesthetic admiration of this picture without coming across as a total sicko. And I can imagine some doubting my rating and recommendation since I would be perfectly happy never seeing this movie again. It is surely one of those things that should be visited once and then studied, pondered about, and contemplated. In spite of how uncomfortable it made me feel, and the sour taste it left my mouth afterward, I cannot deny the visceral power of this psychological melodrama and that it left me fascinated at the end.",The Piano Teacher
36,mattymatt4ever,Intriguing,7,14 February 2003,"First of all, those who are faint at heart should definitely avoid this film.  Even those, like me, who are desensitized to most graphically violent and sexual acts in movies should beware.  I'm not telling you to steer away from the film, but be aware that what you're about to see is some disturbing material.  Definitely not a pleasing film to watch, but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value.  But I must admit, when I watched the film for a second time, I had to skip to the next chapter when the ""razor blade scene"" came up.  The main character is one of the most unsympathetic sympathetic characters I can think of, but we start to better realize the humanity of her character later in the film's second act.  In one scene, she stuffs broken glass in one of her student's jacket pocket after being dissatisfied with her apparently unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous when in front of a live audience.  The student goes into her pocket and cries out with pain as she stares at her blood-stained hand.  Next to the razor blade scene, that disturbed me most.  The student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she.  When she gets word that her daughter won't be able to play, she talks about it like she also got also her hand injured, being one of those spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter into becoming an overachiever. 
Though the film intrigued me and caught my interest for the most part, I felt more needed to be explained about Isabelle Huppert's character.  When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porno movies and engaging in that behavior herself, you want to understand the root of the problem.  The movie establishes that she wants desperately to be loved.  Then why the hateful attitude towards everyone?  Why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain? 
The acting is terrific and I liked the glossy, stylized lighting. Altogether, it's not a film I'd recommend if you're in the mood to be entertained, but as I said it's very intriguing.  And I'm sure if I watched it a few more times, I'd be able to spot certain subtleties that'll shed more light on aspects of the film I didn't realize initially. 
My score:  7 (out of 10)",The Piano Teacher
37,sharky_55,La pianiste,7,4 February 2016,"One night as Erika Kohut returns home, she is immediately confronted with a barrage of questions and accusations and insults by her mother. It turns physical as the pair exchange slaps, and then her mother tearfully relents and guilt trips her into a heartfelt embrace and make-up. We sense that this is a frequent cycle of events in this troubled household. And then slowly, as Haneke always does, the uptight, business-first piano teacher is revealed to be some sort of sexually repressed deviant that seeks solace and expression in BDSM and other sexual kinks. One of the things that this film excels in is visually portraying that carnal lust from our two main characters. One is a middle-aged woman whom is suggested to never have had a normal relationship, while the other is an excited 17 year old boy. In an American film, the lovers would burst through the doors, struggling but somehow never actually removing any of their clothes, and then we would cut to a post-coital scene with the sheets appropriately covering their top halves. Here, they are entwined with such quiet desperation (see the pose on the poster) even as their characters are so at odds with each other. She forbids him from touching her and denies him orgasms, no doubt passing on such a strict manner of obedience from her mother. And he jogs on the spot vigorously and celebrates on his apparent sexual conquest to be, like a 17 year old would. The tragedy then, is in the misunderstanding of the psychological damage that has been done to Erika and its consequences. Walter is uniquely positioned at an age of breaching adulthood and suffice to say that his smile and greeting near the end of the film is supposed to be a pleasant one, but becomes chilling because he has completely misinterpreted the situation. This is a deeply pessimistic film, and I think for once Haneke has missed his mark in attempting to forge this character of Erika. He is forced to rely on these subtly shocking scenes as he often does; the peeing while voyeuristically spying on a couple in a drive-in theatre, the self-mutilation, and the sudden pouncing and sexual longing for the mother that reeks of simplicity and misunderstanding. She is reduced to a delicate sadomasochistic stereotype that so easily wilts over so that we are compliant in being sympathetic with her. It is a pity because Isabelle Huppert's performance deserves much praise. There is a cold, calculated manner in the way she carries herself that puts on such a strong exterior barrier in her persona that makes it so much more effective when we peer into her deeper fantasies. After she is caught in the drive-in, she doesn't scamper away like some red-handed thief, but briskly makes her way out of the area with her head held high like some sort of businesswoman with a busy schedule. The slight embarrassment on Huppert's face sells it. Later, when she catches one of her students looking at porn magazines in a shop (but really it is he catching her), there is that slight embarrassment again, but she acts haughtily and dismissively and quickly pretends to be occupied. She presents herself as the harsh, unsmiling, career-orientated woman while committing such a petty and hurtful act in the background. Haneke shoots these characters in harsh light and washed out palettes even as they are surrounded by beautiful music. His edits link together the steely, unblinking gazes of teacher and student and vice versa, blocking out all other directions. In one instance, he frames Erika at a piano recital, completely surrounded by empty chairs and separated from the others of the group. A conversation with the weeping mother of the wounded child conveys a strong sense of irony when she questions who would be so evil to do such a thing. But this film is not about the lurking of evil below the surface. It is about misunderstanding, and how it gives birth to tragedy.",The Piano Teacher
38,tim-764-291856,My first 9/10 for a Haneke....,9,8 July 2012,"Working chronologically through the Essential Michael Haneke 10 DVD boxed set, The Piano Teacher is the 7th film in that set. It's also about the only one I'd seen before on Film 4 and this time round, it's the first Haneke that I really got into, savoured - and even enjoyed!Haneke only makes films that not only cause ripples, they're more like tidal waves and waver between being irritatingly provoking and genius and often those boundaries oscillate between very narrow margins.For once, Haneke focuses on just one person, an incredibly honest, pained and often humiliating performance from Isabelle Huppert, who is the teacher in question. Completely turning the oft perceived notion that only males can be sexual predators, this immense - and intense - psychological case study is by turns disturbing, superb storytelling and very believable scenarios and behaviour patterns. Long gone, too are Haneke's frequent jarred sequences, this runs fluently and fluidly. The film is also superbly made, this is as far from the grungy, homemade feel of Benny's Video; this is high art, along with lashings of the sadistic and at times, cruel world of the sexually repressed.At over two hours, this is probably Haneke's longest film, but is easily the most compulsive. You simply have to park one's feelings and emotions as it unfolds. Featuring also pornography (as a playing video) and some otherwise very adult orientated material, this could all easily get too much, however unsettling much of it is, I would dare say that any open- minded adult, from pretty well any background would find much in The Piano Teacher - the content is justified by the story and the character.The ending, too, is surprisingly 'satisfying' (you'll see what I mean) for a Haneke, he is usually so open-ended that one often feels a little cheated.I would say that this is Michael Haneke's best film, so far. It's not for everyone, but once immersed, you may find that it's one of the best films of its kind, ever made.",The Piano Teacher
39,Rogue-32,Stunning,10,4 February 2007,"At the end of my review of Cache, I wrote that I was intrigued with Haneke as a film maker. This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about a half hour ago.It's all been expressed, here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like Huppert's Erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. She's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like.This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. I think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. It also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. Huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be. Regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom: I really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, I mean) sucked out of it because of the prior scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. By the time she's acting out her let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom, we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on, her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe.I think another incredible achievement of this movie is how, about halfway through it, I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I was reading sub-titles. That has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and I've seen quite a few. In this film, like Cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike Cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether Huppert's character is alive or dead. After experiencing La Pianiste, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I am, needless to say, more than a trifle intrigued.",The Piano Teacher
40,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Two-sides,8,26 January 2006,"Erika is a highly respected piano teacher in a highly respected music school. She is very regimented, but an effective instructor that rightfully earned her respect. However, beneath the surface of this professor at the top of her game is an emotionally repressed and bizarre personality - she still lives with her mother, visits porn shops, and satisfies her sexual desires through voyeurism and masochism. Things take a turn when she meets Walter, a young engineering student, whose hobby is music, at a recital and he becomes increasingly interested with her and her musical ability, and things really take a turn when he learns of her strange life outside of music.The two leads, Isabelle Huppert and Benoit Magimel, are terrific as two people with nearly opposing interests in one another - one wants love, the other someone to help act out strange and even repulsive fantasies - yet the way they are shown coming closer and closer to each other is nearly mesmerizing. Though the story focuses as much on Erika herself as her relationship to Walter with Isabelle Huppert giving a double edged performance showing two vastly different sides to a person. And the whole is paced almost like a work from a great composer - long, but nonetheless fascinating to sit through. Though, also like classical symphony, this is a film you have to be ready to sit through to fully appreciate it. 8/10Rated R: strong sexual themes",The Piano Teacher

42,RJBurke1942,"Without love, you're dead",9,8 September 2007,"It is rare to find a film that pulls no punches in the realm of human relationships. I can think of Last Tango in Paris (1972), the original version of Suddenly Last Summer (1958) and, latterly, Hidden (2005). There are many others, of course, but those three and this one  The Piano Teacher  share a common theme: the consequences of suppressed sexuality.This is the bare bones story and plot: Erika (Isabelle Huppert) is a professor of music with a gaggle of students who bore her to death, almost. She lives with her mother (Annie Giradot) in a mutually dependent and destructive arrangement but one in which both find masochistic pleasure; there is a perennial power struggle between them, and yet they share the same bed. Students of Freud will no doubt make the most of that. Erika, starved of contact with men, probably as a result of her domineering mother and a weak father, who dies insane (we never see him), puts all her energies into her career as a teacher and deliberately chooses to deny herself sexual contact with men, and instead seeks vicarious pleasure in pornographic pursuits and self-mutilation.Along comes a very handsome and young student, Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is smitten by Erika, his teacher, and sets out to win her over to him and, in his mind, to save her from herself. That sets the stage for a superior psychological study of Erika as a sado-masochistic manipulator who seeks to dominate Walter while also punishing herself as somebody unworthy of sexual satisfaction, never mind love Those who dislike overtly sexual scenes between consenting adults should avoid this movie; I've no doubt they will offend many. Those scenes, however, are crucial to demonstrate the depth of Erika's neurotic sexuality, her depraved sensibilities, and her desperation at the lengths to which she will go in order to seek sexual fulfillment and, at the same time, self-punishment. To some extent, I think, this story also broadly hints at the injustice of the male hegemony vis-à-vis sexual domination, with Erika as a perverted symbol for all women who want to resist that domination.The acting and cinematography are superb. Isabelle Huppert once again tackles a very difficult role with subdued and almost malevolent gusto; it's a credit to her professionalism as an actor. Benoit Magimel is suitably arrogant, confident and domineering while Annie Girardot as The Mother cannot, I think, be faulted. These three carry the story and the movie, no question, but with a good cast of supporting actors. Much of the action take place in a musical conservatory, so there are many long musical scenes with accompanying long takes of the actors simply looking and listening  but not always to the music. And, for classical music fans alone, this film is a treat, with many piano pieces from some of the greatest composers.Freudian to its core, this film will stand unsurpassed, for a long time I think, as a harrowing exposition of love denied with the final shocking scene illustrating the inevitable result.",The Piano Teacher
43,rajdoctor,La Pianiste,8,1 April 2007,"La Pianiste This movie was released in 2001 and there is an Isabelle film festival on-going at the Film Museum in Amsterdam, when I am writing this on April 1, 2007.This is the first film I have seen of Michael Haneke. I 'googled' and read about him a bit more; a professor of directing at Vienna Film Academy, student of psychology, philosophy and theatrical science; PhD at Harvard. And I liked his quote  ""if 300 people are in a cinema watching it (the movie) they will all see a different film"" It tells all about the man and his movies. I think he wants to present something to the audience that will startle them  they will either love his movies or hate it. And I sincerely say that I loved his movie.The story is about a Piano teacher  played brilliantly by Isabelle Huppert - who is staying alone with her mother, and has repressed sexual desires  that she gratifies by indulging in self mutilations and longs for sadistic beatings during sex. (I did not know that this is classified as a psychological category  masochist  but I know now after seeing the movie). Isabelle is talented, strict with her students and does not tolerate any mistakes. She encounters a student  played by Benoit Magimel  who falls in love with her, and on knowing this Isabelle wants him to gratify her sexual fantasies. I won't tell you more about the movie and spoil your pleasure of watching it.The movie has explicit sexual content. The movie has unusual central character of Erika Kohut  played by Isabelle. Some people may not accept the existence of such masochistic character, but I think at least some of them exist in our society and Michael has taken courage to show their side of the story.The piano score is top-class, the camera setting is perfect, it allows you to dwell deep into the scene, the light and shade, the breaking of cinematography balance (I think Michael does it intentionally) and close-ups to go into the psyche of the characters.The acting is marvelous and all the three characters  mother, piano teacher and student have performed excellently and amazingly all three of them have won best actor, actress and supporting actress awards in different Film festivals.(Stars 8.5 out of 10)",The Piano Teacher
44,ruby_fff,It's a powerfully chilling performance from Isabelle Huppert for sure,8,21 May 2002,"Definitely NFE - not for everyone. ""The Piano Teacher"" is not exactly a pleasant film. If you appreciate Huppert's brilliant acting, and is willing to sit through a psychological drama, then go for it. In spite of the film title, do not expect revelry in wonderful piano playing or performances as the drama can overpower instead. There are explicit and explicitly implied sexual content - definitely for mature audience.Isabelle Huppert delivered ""une réalisation formidable"" in her portrayal of an emotionally complex piano professor, devoid of self-loving, desperately needing to be loved yet contradictorily denying herself so. You might say this is an extreme case of motherly nurture in a daughter's piano talent gone perversely bad. Huppert's piano professor Kohut is haunted by her ever-demanding mother (Annie Girardot) who continually treating her daughter 'like a baby', blindly wishing her to succeed beyond being a well-recognized piano teacher at the conservatory.This piano professor may once before enjoyed piano playing and Schubert or Schumann, but her mother's unrelenting pressure on her piano talent backfires. Kohut suppresses her own desires, exhaustingly keeping up a front with her mother, whom she still lives with in the same apartment, has dinner at the same table, sleeps in a bed next to her in the same room. She has not been able to get out of her mother's influence. Constantly she makes excuses to stay out late to be away from mother. Secretly she pursues her own unfulfilled desires for sexual satisfaction. Her chronic desperation and pathetic loneliness are plain for us to see. This could explain the pent up motive to the unsuspecting action which we get to watch her ponderously arrived at and methodically executed. Jealousy is obvious, but from a perverse view, she could very well feel there's no other choice but to 'help' end (her student) Anna's agony from her pushy nagging mother, and in turn, rid of reminding herself similar joyless existence. 
This film is hard medicine - a journey uneasy to swallow. Appreciating Huppert's performance might palliate un peu. Benoît Magimel gave a matching complementary portrayal of Walter Klemmer, the young man who desires and expresses his love for professor Kohut. He became the slim chance for her to manifest the suppressed desperation. Can perverse longings be manifestations of love with passion thrown in the mix? What becomes of the players involved? ""La Pianiste"" is reminiscent of the many shades of Huppert: bleak loneliness in ""The Lacemaker"" 1977, steady fortitude in ""The Story of Women"" 1988, artless treachery in ""Violette"" 1978. I'd like to imagine a hopeful ending: she is once and for all getting away from her mother, starting her life afresh somewhere else, doing something else other than piano teaching. Romantically (why ever not) 'd like to think she can start a life with Klemmer, who does appear to love her and knows how to appreciate and reciprocate love, that he might patiently teach and rejuvenate her in the sharing of love and tenderness. This is beyond ""The School of Flesh"" 1998, which would seem superficial compared to the intensity of writer-director Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher."" For a lighter note with Annie Girardot pairing with Philippe Noiret, try director Philippe De Broca's ""Dear Detective"" 1977. Huppert also has a film with Noiret in director Bertrand Tavernier's ""Coup de Torchon"" 1981, aka ""Clean Slate.""",The Piano Teacher

The brutal discipline and ultimately disappointment when she never achieves virtuosity leaves some heavy psychic scars which she asks would-be student Walter Klemmer to turn into physical scars. The super-confident, tremendously talented, and brutally handsome Klemmer views the ice-cold middle-aged teacher as his own sexual Everest. She responds to his attempts to mount her with sexual games reminiscent of James Spader?s ?The Secretary.? While this may sound like kinky fun to watch, it is anything but. Kohut?s lifetime of self-denial has left her without means of gaining any pleasure from Klemmer other than to torment him with his inability to make her feel anything.

Erika is an anti-hero, she is not someone who evokes complete empathy, but the complexity of character makes her extremely interesting to analyse and interpret. Right from the very first scene Haneke establishes a very abusive relationship between Erika and her mother. The mother(who is never given a name to add to her persona) is an immensely overbearing woman who still has a huge hold and influence on the life of the middle-aged Erika. It is also hinted at that her father underwent mental disintegration which may have also had an impact on Erika's mental state during her formative years. It is slowly revealed that the sexual repression that Erika has had to live under due to her mother, has resulted in her developing various sexual fetishes like voyeurism which range from some interesting habits like frequenting porn stores to some absolutely disturbing habits like self-mutilations. She sees these somewhat twisted sexual fetishes as her way to defy the restrictions placed on her by her mother. However this narrow attitude of viewing sex as a means to defy her mother instead of a way to make love made her build a wall around her making her distant and immune to the possibility of developing any feelings for someone.'The Piano Teacher' for me revolves around the concept of control. Erika never had complete control over her life. Her sexual voyeurism and fetishes were her way to take some control back. Along with this she also overbearingly controlled the performances of her students which at times involved full-fledged intimidation. As soon as she starts developing feelings for Walter, we see her feel uneasy, very flustered and tentative. This is because opening up to him and revealing her complete self(along with her fetishes) to someone would involve giving away the bit of control that she wants. The dynamic between Erika and Walter in its progression and in the way the control shifts from one character to another, feels natural and considering the climax of the film, very believable due to the inherent risks that were always going to appear from Erika's point of view.Haneke doesn't engage in too much flashy camera like he did in 'Code Unknown' with the numerous long shots. The long unbroken shots are here too, but they are used sparingly for crucial scenes. Haneke uses a lot of subtlety in the way he treats the characters and the sensitive subjects with some examples of genuinely brilliant staging and direction of potentially risky scenes. Another thing that Haneke focuses on is close-ups and reaction shots of Isabelle Huppert, which brings me to Huppert's performance. This freaking woman has the ability to convey 25 different emotions with one single look or a subtle raising of the eyebrow or a subtle chuckle. She has the skill to be commanding as well as vulnerable at any moment and Haneke makes use of this with the close-ups and extended shots where the camera just rests on her face. This film will certainly not be as effective without that central performance. Benoît Magimel and Annie Girardot deserve admiration for their performances too.This is not a film for everyone. But the complexity of the characters and Haneke's uninhibited and piercing treatment of sexuality, control and power make this film worth a strong recommendation.",The Piano Teacher
48,Bogey Man,Haneke's cinema at its greatest,10,1 September 2002,"Michael Haneke's films are always very challenging and important, and he for one would never do films just to entertain and make people feel easy. His films are psychologically powerful and discuss things about media, violence and human psyche in general. His film Funny Games (1997) is among the most disturbing and unique studies on violence in media and as entertainment like Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust (1979) was and is, and it is not a surprise that both these films have been misunderstood by many during the years and that's why people not willing to think in cinema should never watch these films and this kind of difficult cinema and then judge them without valid arguments. Haneke's film La Pianiste (Piano Teacher, 2001) is a study about feelings and thus sexuality, which have suffered during the protagonist's (Isabelle Huppert, the piano teacher) life time not least because of her almost dominating mother who doesn't let her daughter live her own life free and without guarding. There's much more than that as can be expected by Haneke.Erika (Huppert) is a seemingly attractive and balanced female in her middle age, and she has a passion for music, piano music in particular. She teaches piano for her students but that seems not to be enough as she wanted to play in real concerts instead of teaching nearly amateurs. Also, she is very jealous of those who are younger than herself and who have ""brighter future"" in music career than she has. She has no husband nor boyfriend, just her mother whom with she shares even her bed with. She has no one to really love, expect the music and her mother, but those don't offer the kind of love a human mind also desires. She has no feelings, as she says herself to one of the characters, Walter (Benoit Magimel), a young piano student she meets and who begins to like Erika very much, but sadly even his thoughts may not be too righteous. This film explores human psyche, which requires some things like love and peace which can be reached from another human being, usually from different sex. Erika is very lonely as her mother seems to have always been, too, and she hasn't ""lived her life"" as she should have, and I mean by this that at the point of some 40 year life time, it is not too normal for healthy female to live with her mother/parents because it restricts and doesn't make it possible for human being reaching independence and own private life, which must not be guarded 24 hours a day, like in Erika's case. Erika's mother always asks what she's done and where she's been and also would like to open doors and see what she's doing in the room. It is often depicted in films that most horrific diseases of mind are because of traumatic childhood and Erika's childhood has ended when thought about her age, but her mother still thinks she is her little child and treats her like one.
Erika is totally cold person and also makes her students often cry or become very sad by her words. As mentioned, she says at one point that she has no feelings, but after that she refers to her feelings so it is clear, she is VERY desperate for real love, warmth and response for her feelings even though she said that she hasn't got any. Human being has feelings, but when they are mistreated or abused, results may be horrific. The nice boy she meets among her students, Walter, first seems like the man of her life, but unfortunately it soon turns out that he is just a man thinking like man who perhaps only wants Erika's body and sexual satisfaction, which he isn't going to get from Erika too easily. I think Erika's destiny would've been much better if she'd met real loving man whom with she would have lived her life. Then she had had the possibility to finally save her damaged feelings and mind and live her life with healthy mind and normal relationship with her mother.Erika watches also porn and practices very perverse acts of ""masturbation"" and satisfaction, which she cannot reach by same methods that most people do. At the scenes depicting hard core sex (in form of videos and magazines), we see again one trademark of Haneke's as camera just witnesses these things and show plenty of information so that we, the viewers, may find ourselves looking carefully those images, too, as they all might go away anytime.. Human mind has a drive for sex and sexual images, and hard core porn industry just feeds the needs of those who cannot get real sex from some reason, and by showing these images (never gratuitous no matter how graphic) Haneke just makes us look to mirror especially when we start to be attracted of the beautiful naked female on the cover etc. We are brutes which have certain instincts and drives and those are active or un-active in the background, and Funny Games is about the last statement in criticizing the sick attraction for violence and violent solutions and their immorality, in films and in real life, too. La Pianiste tells also something about sexes and that how males are sadly to often in more powerful positions than females and it all is underlined in the scene in which Walter says something about how females cannot play with males' sexual satisfaction/needs as it's not possible, and even though the point may not be too clear written in here, you'll understand what I mean by this phrase when you see the film, which involves plenty of ""female not satisfying male."" As I told earlier, I think the last hope for Erika was Walter, but since even he couldn't offer her peace of mind and soul, her self destruction and giving up was the only way. Even music couldn't save her, and it is wonderful to see Huppert's acting abilities in the few scenes in which she is about to smile and/or cry, tears visible, as she hears music or sees something involving it and her passion for it. But since the emotions of hers are so damaged during the years, even this ""non-carnal"" love of hers can't save her.The last scene is extremely disturbing and involves the same ultra powerful cinematic element as Hong Kong film maker Billy Tang's endurance test Run and Kill (1993) which has the same power element by Simon Yam as La Pianiste has by Huppert. The face and its expressions. The killing of the little child in Run and Kill is so unbearably horrific because of the head movements and expressions of face of Simon Yam, and the sad, harrowingly disturbing ending of La Pianiste is also so stunning because of Huppert's face, her fantastic acting talent, and her calm presence and the sudden act of terror, which made some viewers cringe in the cinema, very understandably. The power of cinema can be reached by these ""simple"" little things and details, and when they're handled by really talented artists (like Haneke), the result can be too much for the most casual viewers as well as even more ""experienced"" ones. La Pianiste ends suddenly and leaves the bitter destiny of Erika to viewer's mind long after the viewing, as it all is real and tells about our real world and life, real people.
La Pianiste is a film that cannot be appreciated without understanding cinema as an art form which can deliver very important issues and topics and which can also be larger than life. La Pianiste is a film that should be seen by every psychologist and every parent who has heard from his/her child that he or she needs more privacy and peace. The forthcoming images and scenes once the viewing has started are often disturbing, but important and honest, without hiding anything. I cannot find any mistakes or flaws in this again very brilliant film by Haneke, but I think the credits at the beginning are little irritating and not in sync with the piano music played at the background. This little thing definitely doesn't matter in the final rating, as it doesn't overcome at all the huge merits and achievements of this film. 10/10 for Michael Haneke.",The Piano Teacher
49,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Huppert is absolutely terrifying!,7,7 October 2021,OK - this movie definitely stands out. It was a lot funnier than I was expecting. I feel bad for every single character in this movie - what a bunch of unfortunate MF's. What hellish existences. It's a bit of a draining movie to get all the way through but it's absolutely worth seeing at least once.Isabelle Huppert's performance is literally insane - her character is terrifying. I was getting major Birth vibes about halfway through (the very underrated Nicole Kidman movie from 2004 by the director of Under The Skin & Sexy Beast) and sure enough after I finished the film I read that Nicole Kidman was very inspired by Huppert's performance in this. I will never forget her disturbing near-blank stares - somehow you can see and feel such immense darkness behind her dead eyes. It's definitely heavy.I've never seen anything else quite like it.,The Piano Teacher

51,inframan,Maybe this was made by the cast of Porky's,2,3 August 2003,"This film starts off with promise, There's no better actress around on any screen in any language than Huppert. There are no decorative frills adorning the set or her face, a good sign that we may be going to deal with an honest & grown-up subject.Than it all deteriorates into the silliest kind of adolescent male fantasies about domination & bondage, without the smallest inkling of what's going on in this woman's head. Huppert's blank stares can work wonders when there's enough material in the script for the viewer to fill in the blanks. But here blank is just blank. Her gratuitously nasty, ""kinky"" & baseless behavior wound up making me & others I was watching this with want to see a great big tire tread running across those classic features.Definitely stuff for bored multiplex audiences.",The Piano Teacher
52,smakawhat,"Good acting, poor execution",5,16 November 2002,"No director's films I have ever watched will make you squirm in your seat, or get your mind racing like Haneke.  He still lives up to his old style in this film, about a repressed older piano teacher who can only express her control and emotions in the most authoritative and disturbing ways.  Hupert plays a teacher who berates her students to the point of tears.  She is stuffy, cold, repressed and heartless.  But one day a young man who is infatuated with her tries to join her class and start a love affair.  Now if this were a typical Hollywood film we'd have the same predictable script you can all see, ""their love is forbidden, but he saves her, the agony!, the tears!"".. but far from it.It turns out that what the piano teacher wants out of the relationship is control.  But her desires are so repressed that it ends up transforming in cruel ways, and perhaps not for the better of the 2 parties involved.  While this film is wonderfully acted (Isabelle received best actress for this role at Cannes), it still ends up a little too forced and uninteresting.  Some scenes just drag, and at times you care for those involved, but at other times you couldn't care what happens next.  Also I felt the ending didn't provide me with a conclusion (which is ok sometimes) but it didn't provide me with an insight into what might happen later between the 2.  It's not that it was finished, or that it left you to make up your own ending, but it just ended without explanation it just died and went to a black hole.  To some degree that was the major flaw that went throughout the film.  It is a good insight into the mind of repression, but then what else can it say?? Unfortunatly it doesn't say much of anything else, and finds itself most of the time in a mindless vacuum.Rating 5.5 out of 10",The Piano Teacher
53,GeorgeRoots,Isabelle Huppert Shines In A Movie That Is Classic Michael Haneke.,9,21 October 2014,"""The Piano Teacher"" is a 1983 novel by Elfriede Jelinek, that has been adapted for the screen by Michael Haneke. I've never read the original source material, but through reading a plot summary it seems Mr. Haneke hits a majority of the themes and scenarios represented. Michael Haneke has a certain approach to characters in his movies that I've come to respect a great deal. Aside from shooting his works effortlessly, he has always depicted his characters in a way as to never manipulate the audience, but allow their actions and mannerisms remain open to interpretation for each individual. This allows for less formulaic performances, and a story like ""The Piano Teacher"" can benefit greatly with this approach.Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert), is a piano professor at a prestigious music conservatory. Already in her forties, she still lives in an apartment with her domineering mother (Annie Girardot), leading to much frustration between the pair. Eventually Erika meets Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a 17 year old engineering student and eventually both develop an obsession with each other. Even though she initially tries to sever contact between them, his persistence eventually leads to his discovery of her personal and quite frank voyeurism.For as challenging as the film may get, it never begins to become tedious. Granted for a 2 hour picture the story feels a little stretched, yet it's Haneke's camera work and Huppert's fantastic performance that makes this all so highly engaging and unique. The music is implemented while forged extraordinarily well, and the levels of S&M can become extremely uncomfortable towards the third act, which finally made me realised why so many reviews I've read said it became ""unpleasant"" viewing. Regardless, it all leads to a stunning conclusion and I highly recommend this movie. If we can live in a time where fan-fiction like ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" sells millions, then ""The Piano Teacher"" is in a league of its own and should be praised and held in a much higher regard. Final Verdict: Isabelle Huppert made the movie for me. She really transcends what could've been expected, and my predicaments towards the stories conclusion were consistently altered. 9/10.",The Piano Teacher
54,bix171,Exists In A Vacuum,3,10 December 2002,"Although it features some very brave and admirable performances by leads Isabelle Huppert, Benoit Magimel and Annie Girardot, Michael Haneke's `The Piano Teacher' seems to exist in a vacuum, a film so extreme that though it wants to say something universal (about sexual power and its perverse mutations), it ends up talking to virtually no one. Huppert plays a spinster professor whose rage-fueled desire for control is equaled by her desire to be wholly dominated, at first by her mother (Girardot) and then her mother's surrogate, a young, cocksure student (Magimel). It's very intense stuff and, for a film with such distinguished performers as Huppert and Girardot, pretty explicit (there are pornographic images in a sex shop and the sexual encounters between Huppert and Magimel, though not graphic, appear in real time) which is definitely to the filmmaker's credit: Haneke presents his material with a matter-of-fact approach that strips away all manner of pretension. He also carefully creates, late in the drama, some disturbingly ambiguous shifts in tone so that you're unsure how to interpret crucial, violent moments. (Words Huppert's character uses earlier are returned to her but her response to them is subtle and shaded.)  Yet when all is said and done there is less revealed about our penchant for domination and subjugation than about some cruel, ugly individuals that don't seem to be breathing the same air we do. It's based on a novel (by Elfriede Jelinek, unread by this reviewer) and the emphasis on abnormal thought processes suggests it might have been more insightful as a book.",The Piano Teacher
55,Dockelektro,I'm tired,6,21 November 2001,"Really, I already was a foot behind when I saw ""Funny Games"", where people's perversity reached astronomical heights beyond comparison. When I saw ""La Pianiste"", hoping to land on a movie a little less explicit, I reach the conclusion that Michael Haneke pulls all the rabbits from his pocket, by means of a systematic use of taboo, subliminal and psychological violence. Well, I am personally tired of the ""punch-in-the-stomach"" movies that have been continuously appearing for the last years. What it turns out is a mix of bad taste, cruelty and coldness, in a work that can't please me simply because it doesn't have a heart. Everybody must have loved, Empire Magazine gave it 5 stars, Cannes gave it its most important awards, etc, etc, etc. For me, I am just too damn tired of this kind of movie.

If you try to explain the story it sounds really outlandish but seeing the film and watching the story unfold it seems reasonable and believable until the glass! the peep show! the letter!  Then the tormented state of Erika's  mental health becomes known.   This was a shocking, disturbing movie that stays with you.  Isabelle Huppert's portrayal was perfect.  Rent this movie.

57,christian94,The inner and the outer self,8,21 January 2007,"This film is an exploration of the inner thoughts, fears, desires and realities as opposed to our day-to-day exterior actions and appearance. Isabelle Hupert is masterful in showing a glimpse of these deep interior emotions while at the same time fighting with herself to overcompensate with her demeanor. The story, screenplay and directing is powerful. The classical music is good, but is not overused or central. It is an aspect of the protagonist which she uses to exercise her much needed control (a nice parallel to her overbearing mother's constant need of control).Benoit Magimel is also the right choice to uncover with the viewer the depth of Erika's character. He plays well against Isabelle and switches between love, lust, wonder, shock, affection, repulsion, intrigue, indifference and blind admiration.Michael Haneke makes interesting situations and great film moments. He uses his actors well and his love for the work is apparent. He goes further using sound (or lack thereof) as a powerful element and gets very close with his camera to really get us in the intense, interesting and mostly very human moments. He understands human nature and make us feel, wonder, understand. Jealousy, anger, love, lost, abandon, redemption, failure, self-hurt, all intertwined and expressed in many forms. The characters are all that more believable, flawed, fighting, trying and mostly failing. This is life.The story slowly, but successfully had me riveted and the situations constructed sometimes had me at the edge of my seat by their audacity, creativity and realism. The setup were so strong that the denouement could not live up to it and the scenes anticlimaxed once or twice where the intensity and extremeness could have been explored further. The only other qualm I have is that I found one important scene too static and overly long that could have been changed or edited out. This minor issue in the storytelling is easily forgiven and I am sure the director was trying to pace some deep desperation, confusion, (elation?) yet I found it did not exactly work.All in all a great provocative, thoughtful, memorable film.",The Piano Teacher
58,akash_sebastian,"Haneke's 'La Pianiste' is a Dark, yet Gripping Psychological Thriller.",8,25 May 2013,"Haneke's 'La Pianiste' is a dark, yet gripping psychological thriller, exploring the themes of alienation, loneliness, desire, sex-deprivation, and masochism. Haneke's direct approach of capturing the lead character's life with such excruciating detail gives the viewers a sort of voyeuristic pleasure. That's what makes the film as well as the lead character (Erika) so fascinating.All the three main characters are extremely intriguing; the domineering yet never-satisfied mother, the emotionally and sexually repressed piano teacher (Erika), and the charming and precocious engineering student trying to pursue Erika (Walter). The characters are portrayed brilliantly, especially the one of Erika by the remarkable Isabelle Huppert, who plays the character with such stunning and heartrending honesty.Music also plays an integral role in the film. Erika's fascination with Schubert (who lost his senses in his later years) almost defines her character. Lines from Schubert's 'Winterreisse' quoted and sung in the movie, ""Dreaming of what they don't have, replenished of good and bad. And the next morning all flown away."", resonates so well in the lead character's life.Haneke's direct and unrelenting approach to the material might not be easily accepted by the audiences; only a select group can actually appreciate his terrific feat. This sensitive material, if it were in the wrong hands would have been such a disaster; thanks to Haneke and Hupert, it's not.Ultimately, 'La Pianiste' is a deeply-moving and thought-provoking film.",The Piano Teacher
59,noahgibbobaker,A personal favourite.,10,19 October 2020,"La pianiste or the piano teacher is one of my all time favourite movies. Usually when reviewing a film I love so much I write endless paragraphs about everything I love, but I'm using this review as an opportunity to highlight all of the issues I have with the piano teacher.The first ""issue"" I have is that Isabelle Huppert doesn't hold her pinkie finger correctly when playing piano. Anyone who has been taught how to play piano will pick up on this. This is odd to me as Isabelle Huppert actually plays piano so I don't know why she doesn't hold her finger properly. This isn't a big issue at all, it's easy to get over.My second and final issue is actually a problem with the film. During an extremely important scene the ADR is pretty bad and fairly distracting.

And, the depiction of sexual violence is incredibly clever. Haneke suggests more than he shows, but the viewer ends up imagining more than Haneke would have dared to show. Which, for me, indicates all the brilliancy of the directing.The last aspect but no the least is certainly the amazing performances delivered by Benoît Magimel and Isabelle Huppert. Considering the difficulty of their roles, I can only acclaim their commitment.In conclusion, The Piano Teacher shocks and makes you think with all the virtuosity that characterizes Haneke.

61,nesfilmreviews,"Disturbing, yet we cannot look away.",8,2 February 2013,"In Michael Haneke's ""The Piano Teacher,"" which won three awards at Cannes 2001 (best actress, actor and film), Isabelle Huppert plays the role of a bold, conflicted woman named Erika Kohut. Erika is approaching middle age-she is a highly respected and equally demanding instructor at the conservatory of music in Vienna. Erika is stone cold--distant, unsmiling, she leads a secret life of self-mutilation. In the classroom she sits without emotion, but listens attentively to her students. She doesn't want to help her students however--she wants to destroy them. Erika lives with her domineering mother, who is immediately subjected to her mother's demanding questions the minute she walks through the door. We quickly realize Erika is completely manipulated and owned by her mother's invasive possessiveness. Instantly Erika resorts to behaving like a child, or a rebellious teenager at best. They both sleep in the bed together. Her mother (a chillingly unsympathetic Annie Girardot), complains and is bitter about money Erika is squandering. Pleading, shouting, and violence is followed by brief tearful apologies-- and it is obvious that this is a well-worn habitual pattern. She intrusively rings Erika when she is rehearsing, and apparently has no life of her own. Enter Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel), who is a handsome, self-assured student who auditions for her class and is forthright in his attraction to her. She responds coldly then demands he let her lead. Then she changes the role with a detailed letter, inviting him into her dark, twisted fantasies. The sex scenes within the movie, while not graphic, are long, uncomfortable--and psychologically brutal. The movie goes to a place of mad masochism. At a certain point we begin to feel that the director, the characters, and the actors will take this anywhere--there are no boundaries. Erika is not simply an adventuress, or a sexual experimenter--Erika is a psychological train wreck. Walter's dreams and thoughts about an experienced older woman have turned into nightmares about interactions and scenarios he doesn't even want to know about. Erika is a highly respected professor at the prestigious Vienna conservatory, who just happens to spend her free time visiting pornography dens and mutilating her genitals. The women is a ticking time bomb that's on the verge of exploding at any given point. Some audience members will dislike the ending, but with a film like this any conventional ending would be a cop-out. Ultimately, ""The Piano Teacher"" is a disturbing portrait of a woman in power coming undone before our very eyes.",The Piano Teacher
62,dschmeding,An emotionally harsh movie,7,16 March 2008,"Watching a movie by Haneke you know its nothing to get you in a party mood. La pianiste is a depressing and slow movie which is focusing on the incredibly played main actor Isabelle Huppert in the role of a piano teacher Erika. From the beginning you know something is not quite right with this woman that still lives with her mother (and even sleeps in the same room to fall asleep with her bragging) and goes out on nighly journeys that are quite the opposite to her daily routine life teaching piano and being obsessed with Schubert.We soon learn that she harbors a lot of frustration that is released on her students who not just once leave the lesson crying and sexual tension that she releases on her nighly journeys. But as if her visits in porn cabins sniffing used tissues or watching couples in car cinemas isn't enough soon a young man steps into her otherwise empty life who admires her playing and reveals her disturbing secrets even more.Like many aspects of the movie its uncertain if he really falls in love with her, just admires her talent or seeks to add an older woman to his experience. For my taste he gets too involved for the latter two since the piano teacher reveals a rather odd sexual preference which is hard to watch and even harder to deal with for Walter who gets deeper into her thoughts.Its hard to feel sympathy with Isabelle Hupperts Character Erika at first since she is absolutely cold and in her dealing with Walter annoying. But her dominant/subordinate games like the obscure toilet scene soon show she is a woman who lost her self and tries filling the gap with something she isn't sure of. Ultimately she wants to be loved but is stuck in a sadomasochistic roleplay that leads to terrible consequences when she realizes that its not what she hoped and longed for.Its in these moments when finally her coldness begins to explain and the confused psychology becomes clearer, but never clear. Haneke leaves so much open to the viewer. For example, does she just hurt a female student with shards of glass hidden in her pocket just to eliminate a contester for Walter who showed interest in the girl (her running on he toiled and peeing immediately after points to that since it indicated sexual arousal in another odd scene)... or does she recognize herself in the girl who is driven to become a perfect pianist by her obsessive mother and lose touch with real life and love like her? Is Walter a bad person (many scenes indicate the opposite) and just takes revenge for being played with or does he really try to give in to Erikas kinky wishes as a sign of love? Its hard to say... Erikas uncertain often childlike, then dominant and cold behavior makes Walters actions explainable. How would you react if someone you fell in love with demands what is quite the opposite of love for you. Its heartbreaking seeing Erikas face when Walter reads her letter and starts feeling disgust for her although it is the greatest sign of love and openness Erika could ever give and as the finale indicates will ever give.Maybe Haneke plays his well known game in showing how confused and wrecking human relations can become but takes it to a higher level. In the end both characters have to deal with hard situations and Erika gets broken... or does she break herself? In the end all characters seem both unsympathetic and pitiful.The movie got me but not for the supposedly shocking scenes... by far more gripping is the emotional vacuum and hopelessness that is created by Erikas actions... her final look into the camera with a hint of tears on her cold emotionless face and a disgusted act of self mutilation are shattering. Is she disgusted by herself, by Walter, by her mother and the whole world or by her actions that led to the girl not being able to play the concert.... we don't know and Haneke leaves that door so wide open that many will be angry at the extremely open end. To me these uncertainties were what filled Erika with humanity since they made me as a viewer get thinking and trying to explain. Life is hard and being different, for whatever reasons that led to Erikas sexually and emotionally repressed state, makes it ultimately harder.So don't expect this to be a pure shock-fest... its more than that but like other Haneke Movies its way too stretched and slow.",The Piano Teacher
63,faraaj-1,Disturbing film about sexual repression,6,7 September 2006,"The Piano Teacher is a very disturbing film about a sexually repressed and deeply flawed woman - played very well by Isabelle Huppert.We get an early introduction to the cause of her repression when she comes home late one evening and has a fight with her mother - a degrading experience for both mother and daughter. Huppert has devoted herself to her profession of Piano Teacher and sets very high standards for herself and her students. Yet she has a secret sex life with sexual encounters including watching porno films in private theaters and a particularly sickening scene involving a razor blade.A young student, obviously infatuated with her, enters her life and brings some hope that she may eventually have a normal relationship. But her desire to control, perhaps an off-shoot of her profession and the deepening sickness of her mind prevent that from happening.Not a very pleasant, although admittedly well-crafted film, The Piano Teacher falls short on two counts. 1- The lead character is not someone you can like or sympathise with. 2- It can get quite revolting in parts with no eroticism whatsoever.Another, and better film dealing with sexual repression is an early Roman Polanski film called Repulsion.",The Piano Teacher

The movie itself is a different matter. The main character is sad, twisted, and compelling, and so is the story, but the overall effect is excellent. However, The Piano Teacher is not an easy thing to watch because its subject matter is so strong, the main character's problems are severe and totally unfamiliar to most of us, and handling this character in such a matter of fact way, as the director chose to do, is more than a little unsettling, and, I think, somewhat misleading. My advice? Suck up the pain and watch this. It is a masterful story done with a masterful performance, but you'll need a trip to the brandy cabinet when you're finished.",The Piano Teacher
65,debblyst,"If you think the movie is shocking, wait till you read the book!!",9,2 November 2003,"If you think piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's film ""LA PIANISTE"" is the ultimate degree in the personification of derangement, perversion and darkness, I've got news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede Jellinek's novel ""LA PIANISTE"" (on which the film was based) is twice as ""repulsive"", ""disgusting"", ""deranged"" and even more fascinating -- though there can't be words enough to translate the level of artistic proficiency that Isabelle Huppert has reached here, above all other mortal actresses in activity today. And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano playing/dubbing an actor could deliver?In the novel as in the film, there are two big antagonists to the ""heroine"" Kohut: her own mother (wonderful, wreck-voiced Annie Girardot, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria itself. The mother personifies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist/fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and, let's say, übermensch ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdown.""La Pianiste"" also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one (you think) you love. We tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves, which may turn out to be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. Here, Kohut learns (?) the lesson in the most painful and humiliating of ways.It must be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the best-known and praised authors in Austria and Europe (well, now she's got a Nobel Prize!) and that autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel, as she herself was a pianist and had a reportedly difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also includes long passages about Kohut's childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now. Haneke chose to hide this information in the film, forcing us to wonder how she got to be that way (don't we all know a Erika Kohut out there?). But he very much preserves the fabric of the book in his film: unbearable honesty, to the point where most secretive, ""horrendous"" feelings painfully emerge -- envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hate, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion etc. All of them unmistakably human.I thought ""La Pianiste"" was a deeply moving film, very disturbing and thought-provoking, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's just all I ask of movies. It also made me buy and be thrilled by the book, discover a fantastic author I hadn't read before, and listen again and again to Schubert - so, my thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle!!! On the other hand, if you're looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My vote: 9 out of 10",The Piano Teacher
66,netwallah,"This is not sexual repression, its a descent into madness",10,15 December 2006,"The part about music is amazingly passionateas Erika Kohut, a music professor in a prestigious conservatory in Vienna, Isabelle Huppert is simply brilliant. Erika seems a bit single-focused, but the music is beautiful and her intensity seems at first to be appropriate enough. Still, there's a warning in one conversation when she speaks of the last work written by a composer who knew he was going mad. There's a fatal melancholy associated with the undertow of madness for some artists. And her hysterically protective and interfering mother (Annie Giradot) seems close to the edge, tooand it turns out Erika's father has been in a mental hospital for years. The music goes on. Gradually, however, Erika's predilections rise to the surface: private self-mutilation, casual and inconsistent verbal cruelty to her piano students, visits to the video peepshow booths, actual peeping at a drive-in movie accompanied by excited urination. And then when a Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel), a handsome young engineer/piano student, pursues her, she at first resists him, and then succumbs, but not as he had hoped she would. She has just filled her timid student's coat pocket with broken glass at the big concert hallI don't know why, except that Walter was being nice to herand the girl is badly hurt. Walter follows Erika into a bathroom and kisses her; she calmly makes it clear that she is in charge, and yet she doesn't stick to this dominance. She writes him a letter that changes everything. He wants to love her; she wants him to tie her up and hit her. She can't understand why he's repulsed, and pursues him. Ultimately he comes around one night, locks her mother in her bedroom, hits her, and has violent sex with her on the floor. ""With her"" is not quite rightshe lies there with a blank look, her mouth twitching slightly. The next day she sees him at the concert hall, happy with other people. She stabs herself in the shoulder and walks away from the hall, bleeding, away from the music, and away from the camera. I think some people have considered this a movie about sexual repression. I don't think so. It's a movie about Erika's descent into madness, which is mediated through sex, but it is more than sexual malaise. It's clear that she has gotten it into her head that ropes and chains are the way things are done, that Walter will want this, and she can't understand why he has rejected her and hurt her. Huppert, again, acts the part of the overstressed, the hysterical, the neurotic, and the borderline madwoman better than anyone, and here she is in her element.",The Piano Teacher
67,quinimdb,The Piano Teacher,10,14 November 2016,"""The Piano Teacher"" is an intense character study that centers around a perfectionist piano teacher, Erika Kohut, her demanding mother, and an effortlessly charming and talented young man, Walter that wants to be taught by Erika. That description of the movie (and the characters), however, does not do it any sort of justice. This is an incredibly subtle, psychological, expertly crafted film. All of the camera placements, editing and shot selection, and blocking of the actors are precise and perfect, each element contributing to the characters and the building intensity of the subtle psychological battle between them going on underneath the surface. Perhaps the most standout aspect of this film, however, is the performances. This is a film that could've been much worse if the actors weren't at the top of their game, and boy, do they deliver. They each add depth and nuance to their characters in the most subtle ways, showing the repressed emotion behind each character perfectly, most specifically Isabelle Hupert, who, even the most silent stretches of the film, manages to invest the audience into her character and the flurry of conflicting thoughts and emotions constantly stirring inside her. As a character study, only a complete scene by scene analysis of the film could truly convey the full spectrum of each character and their individual desires and how each one relates to the other. Almost every action of the characters has a deeper meaning, and teaches us more about them. It is definitely one of the greatest character studies I've ever seen, if not the best.Michael Haneke's omniscient style works well with this brutal and realistic film, and it may be his best as well (although every film I've seen of his has been essentially perfect, except for maybe ""Funny Games""). Even though its a hard watch, definitely watch this, because it is everything a character study should be.",The Piano Teacher
68,skymovies,"Not controversial, just a con",3,26 September 2003,"Just because a movie deals with adult themes, adopts a near-funereal tone of seriousness, and shows in the arthouse, doesn't mean it's any good. The Piano Teacher is no more valid an examination of sexual obsession than Nine And A Half Weeks, and as a psychological character study, it's even weaker. Who cares about this woman? She's miserable, self-absorbed and boring - which sums up the whole film. Director Haneke might think he's making a point by refusing to give any explanation as to what makes Erika tick, but what he's really doing is copping out. This mean and tedious drama is just an excuse to create a bit of controversy with a few 'shocking' sex scenes (which were merely tiresome), and I can't help thinking that Haneke is having a laugh at the audience's expense. That p**** me off.",The Piano Teacher
69,diand_,Suffocated,6,26 July 2005,"The novel of Elfriede Jelinek where La Pianiste is based upon is an interesting feminist study of suffocation of women by men set against an autobiographic background. Die Klavierspielerin is also a personal settlement of her life with her mother. Jelinek herself studied at a Conservatory in Vienna. Later works of her are more an indictment of the suffocation of life in Austria, a common element in Austrian post-war culture as the country has never come to grips with its troubling past.In the movie less emphasis is paid to the relationship with the mother and so the source of Erika's behavior remains largely unexplained here. Erika's father dies and mother and daughter show no emotion at all. In the beginning there is a short fight between mother and daughter about control the mother has on her life. The TV is always on, thereby explaining that mother and daughter don't live life to the fullest at all. Later on she sleeps in one bed with her mother; her mother suddenly starts to warn her for failure if not performing at her best, a theme often to be found in Jewish culture. Huppert is apt for this role and some years earlier did another movie where Jelinek did part of the writing (Malina).The glass-breaking scene has a double meaning. Not only does Erica want to punish Walter for his attention to and interest in another student, she also sees a reflection in that girl's mother of her own mother; in a way she wants to help her preventing having the same life as her with no personal choices of her own.By entering into the relationship with Walter, a classic male/female struggle starts. Although women in Western societies are nowadays more equal than ever before, Jelinek wants to say that women and men are still strictly attached to certain role models that are almost all power-driven (among which sexual role models). Her sexual desires, although extreme and communicated in the most awkward of possible ways, can not be realized in a relationship. The relationship turns into a sexual battleground, in order to be loved and not lose Walter she has to give in to him, so he eventually vindicates and her total disintegration as a woman starts. The self-inflicted wound in the end only confirming her loss and being a 'punishment' for her choices.The movie's distant and cold-hearted style reflects the book, so there is congruency there. But the movie lacks interesting camera-work as all shots are long and static shots that only move sometimes to follow the characters. I find this combination often deadly for a movie. Compare this to Tarkovsky (long but moving shots) or Koreeda (short but static), both of which can work. Cinematography is almost absent here. Haneke can create shock value from his actors and by editing: The transition of the first traditional part to the sex store is rather abrupt, although not on the level of editorial transitions Kubrick makes in Eyes Wide Shut for example. There are some good moments: There is no music when the end credits run, the use of Schubert (although used better in Barry Lyndon) as indication of 'decay', Erika never performing for a large audience herself, the mother has no name.On her personal website, Elfriede Jelinek has commented about the movie making process. Not only does she see the meticulous planning process associated with making a movie as restricting and compares that to the choices one has to plan his or her own life. On that website she has also written a very interesting review of Lynch's Lost Highway, one of the more important movies ever made. If ever a director like that could have taken on this intriguing book.",The Piano Teacher
70,mweston,3 stars (out of 4),7,15 October 2002,"It better be art, because it *sure* isn't entertainment.Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) is a 40ish music professor who teaches people to play the piano. When the film opens she has come home later than expected to the apartment that she shares with her mother (Annie Girardot). Her mother is upset that Erika is so late and demands an explanation, going through Erika's purse when Erika won't say anything except that she was out walking. They have a huge fight and an equally passionate reconciliation where Erika's mother excuses both of them by saying that they have always been ""hot blooded."" And when they go to sleep, we see that they sleep in the same bed. And all this happens before the opening credits.The opening credits are the first example of the interesting use of sound in this film. We see piano lessons being given, but when the credits are intercut, the sound goes away completely and suddenly, only to come back just as suddenly. The other sound-related technique I noticed was very long sound bridges, where the sound continues from one scene many seconds after the visual cut to the next, or vice versa where the sound starts significantly early. Perhaps this disconnection of the audio and the video is because Erika's work (music) and her personal life are so disconnected.I don't want to give too much away, but if you've seen or read anything at all about this film, you know that there is a relationship with a much younger male student. His name is Walter Klemmer (Benoît Magimel), and he becomes fascinated with her at a recital in a private home where she plays and later he plays. Although he is majoring in engineering (the subtitles initially say ""low voltage"" as I recall), he pursues her, wanting to take lessons from her, and more. He is very confident, which is perhaps not a surprise for someone with such diverse talents.This film won a grand jury prize at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, and Huppert and Magimel won the best actress and actor prizes there as well. Of these awards, Huppert's seems the most deserved. She manages to play someone who is generally very reserved and controlled, while somehow subtly hinting at the extreme turmoil below the surface. There are often very long takes of her where there is almost no motion, and yet there are shifts. It's pretty amazing.I saw this film because of the awards, but I knew that it was going to be difficult going, and it was. And in some scenes it went well beyond what I was expecting. In order to avoid spoiling the film I have not told you what the difficult things are, but they are definitely there. You should only see this film if you are *very* open minded and also able to leave films behind when you leave the theater. This one may stick with you even if most challenging films do not.Seen on 7/24/2002.",The Piano Teacher
71,howie73,A stunning achievement,10,11 April 2008,"Haneke's stunning La Pianiste is an austere and shocking exploration of a volatile female sexual desire. As the protagonist, Erika, Isabelle Huppert gives a career-best, tour de force performance as the tortured Piano professor whose desire is in excess of social norms governing heterosexual couplings.Many have seen the film as an expression of Erika's sexual oppression but this is far from the case. Erika is never afraid to indulge her dark, sexual desire, whether it be in a sleazy porn shop or while voyeuristically watching young lovers kiss in an open-air cinema. Erika's sexuality is in excess of her allocated neutered role in society and this is why she never achieves harmony with Walter, whom she loves in her own prescriptive way yet he cannot reciprocate her desire which is even more masculine than his.Goverened by technicality and precision akin to her role as a respected Professor, Haneke portrays Erika as a subversive character but she is also a figure who enlists our sympathy and empathy; and herein lies the emotional power of Haneke's adaptation. Erika is all too human and in spite of her exacting and at times callous nature, she demands to be loved, even if her demands go beyond what is deemed normal in heterosexual unions where male/female equals aggressive/passive, dominant/subservient.Hanke, as always, is a master of visuals and here he demonstrates his command of the form. There are many unforgettable scenes and innovative camera angles and also a a sense of dream-like intensity in some scenes that Haneke quietly brings in to the film at unexpected moments. The film ranks as one of Haneke's best but is not for the faint of heart.",The Piano Teacher
72,lingmeister,"A raw, unglamorized look at S/M.",8,10 December 2002,"Having seen a few other movies by Michael Haneke, namely Funny games and Code inconnu, I didn't come in expecting some erotic flick.  I was not mistaken, but was still taken by how dark and visceral this movie was.  With disturbing scenes of humiliation, beating, vomiting, along with other unglamorized ways of getting it on (or not getting it on.)Hupert plays this piano professor/teacher of a music conservatory in a prim and proper world.  She also lives with her mother, who tries to control her life to the n'th degree.  She true feelings are trapped within her since she could not express it in either world.  The only ways she could channel out all her anger and emotion is through her teaching and her sexual escapades, which are both ruthlessly disturbing bordering on the extremes, when her tug-of-war interlude with a student gets more extreme every time until it goes beyond her control.Hupert's performance is very bold and powerful, and she took a very big risk doing it.  Actresses in the US of her stature usually would just go do safe movies or roles that don't venture into controversial topics.In all, a disturbing movie that will leave a really bad taste in your moth, but one that should not be missed.

73,AnthonyMeg,The carnal needs of the pianist.,8,22 March 2019,"This is a film with an argumentative topic. A realistic portrayal of emotional conflicts and weird sexual desires that has scenes beyond assumptive standards which indicate that it's a proper one for debate, but the movie wouldn't be as innovative and special if these scenes weren't there.The film builds up slowly and as the movie progresses some unexpected dark sides of the pianist character disclosed in her personality. The outro is seen as discordant to a lot of people, but I'd rather call it ambiguous because there's a correlation between the ending and the pianist odd behavior. Normal people will deem the film as an obscene film; in my opinion you can't call it that since the theme is a taboo to begin with. The movie sheds a light on sexual repression and the realm of Paraphilia and fetishism and how people resort to them to fulfil their perverse fantasies ensured from sexual privation. It is a disturbing movie, especially if the viewer is used to watch the typical romantic movies and not familiar with similar movies they will find it quite shocking Yet, it is a thought-provoking I disagree with people labeling this movie as an adult. Sure, for a few seconds you'll see a part of a porn shots, however, you can't label a two-hours movie based on few second, You have to admire the acting of Isabelle she executed a quite difficult role the movie is suitable for those who become jaded from watching normal romantic films this might satisfy them.

The ingenious thing is that you barley see any explicit ""act"", but you are forced to imagine everything very explicitly. The acting was entirely convincing making it even more disturbing. Just all portrayed human relations were somehow frustrating. I don't remember any other film having succeeded to play with my emotions so badly. That is why I won't watch it again soon.

75,n-mo,"Oddly surreal, yet frighteningly down-to-Earth",8,21 July 2007,"This is a difficult film that can be interpreted from a number of angles. It has been suggested that the chilly cynicism of Erika Kohut and her mother is a synecdoche for the cold, casual indifference of family life and obsession with appearances prevalent in Viennese society. I am scarcely in a position to comment on such a claim, but it would make sense.La Pianiste may also be an inquest into the curse that makes a prodigy. Repressed by her authoritative mother, a superficial social atmosphere, and her own insecurities, Erika has channeled all her energy into her beloved musical instrument, and the energy with which she plays is surely fabulous, yet no dose of that piano will ever provide a sufficient outlet for her overburdened sanity. It is for this reason that she becomes a bit... frazzled in her middle age. She plays the piano with a jealous and inhuman passion because her want for any other emotional outlet has, frankly, rendered her inhuman, and this is also why she is incapable of receiving love as a living person. (I'm not overly familiar with Nietzsche, but is this a parody of the Übermensch?)Yet, although I seriously doubt this film was intended as an exposé, Erika's behavior rings quite true with my own and my friends' experiences with people in the entertainment and performing arts industries: egocentric, vengeful and emotionally unstable. As a matter of fact, one friend had a first-rate voice teacher who apparently kept a knife hidden in her car seat and would always try to coax her best students to ride with her to their venues. (She was later hauled off to jail for sexually molesting a male student.)Well-conceived and well-crafted, even to the point of being almost too plausible to convey its historical or philosophical point.",The Piano Teacher
76,PeterJackson,Endless...,2,31 August 2001,"Well well, just as I was about to put Michael Haneke somewhere between my favorite directors, he makes this film, a shallow, mindless, endless, pretentious, hollow and utterly boring piece of crap. If this is the nouveau style of French film-making, give me yet another blockbuster instead. It simply can't be worse than this. And it really hurts to see that the rating here is 8.2 (19 votes), when I started to write this, and that this film won a couple of awards in Cannes. Not that Cannes can be taken seriously anymore, but still...
The film is about a piano teacher (don't confuse this film with THE PIANO However!), who doesn't want any of her students to surpass her, who gets involved with a brilliant new student in a perverse sexual relationship, and who is dominated by her ""insane"" mother (who, in the end, doesn't seem so insane anymore, after all that we saw before). Read the previous line again, save yourself the money, and send it to me instead if you really want to throw it away. Haneke's FUNNY GAMES was a masterpiece, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 90's. This films is one of the worst. They're both about sick minds, but whereas FUNNY GAMES was shocking and definitely had substance, this film is just boring and shallow. It's about sex, sexual perversion, people who aren't able to express their feelings, ... did I say that it was about sick people? Anyway, unlike BAISE-MOI, ROMANCE and INTIMACY, there is almost no nudity or pornography shown in this film. Just a video that the teacher is watching. Apparently, Haneke didn't have the guts to go all the way. Instead, he bores us to death with long close-ups and sick thoughts, and again, and again... Even the beautiful classical music used plentiful in this film, doesn't seem so beautiful after all here. A real accomplishment!Wanna see a film about sick minds? Rent FUNNY GAMES.

If the purpose of this film is to show us that sexual psychosis can occur in the minds of well-respected and highly talented individuals, I think it hardly earth-shaking news.  And if conceived as a vehicle for the talented Ms. Huppert, I found her performance to be wildly overrated, as she swung between cold calculation and desperate childish pleadings as though in an actors' studio exercise.

Her life is regimented and controlled by her overbearing mother, played by Annie Girardot. It seems her life has always been this way, as Erika has never been in any kind of relationship. Her mother has pushed her to become a piano virtuoso, at the expense of a social life or any social skills. She cannot go out without explaining every minute to her mother. She teaches piano to children of parents who are probably just as overbearing as her own mother; these parents' lives centre around an endless stream of recital after recital for their kids. Erika was once a student, and now she is a teacher, so she is just prolonging this banal pastime into the next generation. She belittles her students, probably much like she was belittled by her own teachers. The piano recital community produces a lot of miserable people. Erika has a secret life to escape from her stifling existence. She visits peep shows and erotic bookstores. She has been so repressed for so long that her sexual fantasies have gone into the perverse territory of sado-masocism now. She doesn't dream of tender love, she dreams of being beaten and controlled.She eventually meets Walter, a handsome, highly-talented twenty-something engineering student. Walter is nothing like Erika or any of her repressed students. He is multi-talented and charming. He plays sports, is in engineering, and at the same time he is a great piano player. Walter can be anything he wants, including a piano virtuoso, he is not forced into it like all of these other people. Walter zeros in on her after meeting her, and wants her right away. She wants him too, but her lack of social skills seems to make it look like she detests him. In actual fact, she is hiding behind a facade of arrogance. Walter eventually decides to take piano lessons from her to get close to her. Erika just keeps acting arrogant, but this is part of her masochistic fantasy, and eventually she reveals her fantasies to him. Walter is shocked that she has such sick fantasies, when all he wanted to do was love her. Walter starts to feel repulsed by her, because of her fantasies. Erika realizes this, and makes attempts to come to his point of view. At the same time, Walter seems to start showing some interest in Erika's sado-masocism.

He wants love, a concept far beyond her understanding, which is mainly based on porn videos watched in dank shops and cinemas, and consequently he totally refuses her depraved sexual ideas (delivered in writing, of course), and from there it goes down-hill.The elderly mother is excellently played by Annie Girardot, while the young blond and athletic student of electronics - and music - is very well portrayed by Benoit Magimel, who got Best Male Actor Award in Cannes 2001, for his role in this film.The acting by Isabelle Huppert (Best Female Actor, Cannes 2001) is far beyond anything I have seen - even excellent Halle Berry in Monster's Ball pales in comparison, but the story is so weird and disturbing that it never will make it to the IMBd's top 250!",The Piano Teacher

(I thought it was just me that be mental). People that dislike this movie probably haven't encountered the quiet, frightening insanity that ripples below the surface of respectability. THE PIANO TEACHER is a feel bad movie, but a feel bad movie that is ultimately rewarding. It is akin to suffering during a workout, only to be glad you did soon afterwards. THE PIANO TEACHER is satisfying in the sense that it is an astonishing story. Beware of the graphic portrayal of sex, perversion and freak-out scenes. But this movie is not gratuitously sick, in the way that Tarrantino's Kill Bill IS gratuitous sick, because it is intelligent and character centered. The true impact comes from the performances, the music, the direction, the revelations and sheer psychological supernovae. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD The glass in the pocket motive seemed to me very weird (and upsetting) at first glance. The trick is to look at this amazing twist from the perspective of insanity. The teacher felt spontaneous compassion for her pupil, perhaps love. So she wished to do her pupil a favour by destroying her piano playing career, after all, the 8 hours a day practice was obviously turning the poor girl into a wreck. The only way she knew of giving happiness and comfort was to give pain. War and terrorism, to name just two loathsome horrors, operate on exactly this paradoxical, twisted principle of rational insanity!

From the beautiful soundtrack,sometimes accompanied by real playing by the lead actors, to the ambiguous commentary on male-female sexual power relations,the breath-taking acting done by lead Isabelle Huppert,the gut punching, stomach turning climax and ending segments;La Pianiste not only makes justice to Elfriede's novel but also in some ways surpasses it.",The Piano Teacher
84,terraplane,Why some people end up teaching piano...,10,31 March 2005,"Does the pursuit of the intellectual demand the sacrifice of the physical and emotional to the extent that mental disintegration is the result? Is it a condition of the intellectual to be either completely asexual or so sexually repressed that descent into the darker regions of sexual gratification is the only way to deal with real human behaviour? Maybe. And does the dominating influence of the Mother figure, who in turn has denied her emotional needs to drive her own thwarted ambitions through a talented child, result in such an emotionally crippled adult that there is no amount of love that can reverse the damage? Quite possibly. These themes have been written about and discussed for centuries, films, books and plays have all taken these questions and come up with many variations, from Oedipus to Norman Bates. Hermann Hesse explored the territory in his great novel ""Steppenwolf"", Harry Haller being the very embodiment of the repressed intellectual. In fact, Hesse is a good example of the aesthetic intellectual seemingly devoted to matters of the mind rather than the body. ""The Glass Bead Game"" is a fine example of a novel written purely for the intellect, in other words, mind games. But is it satisfying just to feed the mind whilst starving the emotions? Come to that, is it healthy? What happens to creativity when the denial of the emotional is detrimental to the aspirations of the intellectual?You become a piano teacher.Isabelle Huppert gives a frighteningly convincing and ultimately tragic performance as Erika. Yet another ""foreign"" actress who can outperform any of Hollywood's empty vessels but is never rewarded or recognised with an Oscar. This is not an easy film to watch at times but it is not meant to be simple entertainment. Definitely not for the squeamish or those who find scenes of strange sexual behaviour upsetting. But then we all have our dark side.",The Piano Teacher

The directing hits the mark, But, in the end, why bother?The film explores control, obsession, and desire. All along, it asks which of these traits change when you append ""sexual"" as the adjective. The Europeans have a special way of making sex unappealing and naked bodies unattractive, though this film is light in the way of nudity.Throughout, the movie teases the idea of the seemingly unobtainable and the tantalizing possibilities of it being almost within reach. It asks the viewer to watch as desire becomes reality and reality turns out to be vastly different than fantasy. Again, consider pasting sexual to most of the preceding verbs.On every level of construction, the film excels. For the viewer, though, I wouldn't watch it again.",The Piano Teacher
87,mcnally,Grim but excellent,9,10 September 2002,"I saw this film at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. La Pianiste reinforces the ""Austrians=grim"" thesis I'm formulating. Isabelle Huppert won a well-deserved Best Actress award at Cannes for her portrayal of a woman who, in her efforts to attain the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. Trapped by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways. When a younger student falls in love with her, our hopes rise, but are soon dashed by the realization that she cannot experience love the way others can. It is too late for her, and the film's final 30 harrowing minutes are, tellingly, devoid of the beautiful music that carried the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it's describing.",The Piano Teacher
88,antcol8,"...served up as ""art""",7,4 June 2006,"Where was my dear old Andrew Sarris when I needed him? I went to the Rotten Tomatoes site, knowing that he would've said something cutting and efficient. But his review couldn't be accessed. A shame...I remember his terms like Antoniennui and his description of Siodmak. And they're apropos, let me tell you. This movie is very good. A great performance (as nearly always) by Huppert. Fairly serious use of classical music (although the use of the scherzo of the Schubert A major sonata as Walter's tool to impress Erika was a risible choice - a relatively ""light"" movement, and the performance of the Schubert trio was really lackluster). Lots of good things...But I have to mourn the death of the radical artist I thought (after seeing Funny Games) Haneke had the possibility of becoming. He chose instead to participate in the dissemination of one of the most exhausted tropes of world cinema: stylish perversion. Funny Games seemed to be a critique of Austrian society (and, by extension, society in general) from within: the manners, the politeness, the superciliousness, the ""culture"", the unostentatious ostentatiousness. It was brutal and unsentimental. This film is the ""grown-up"" version, ready for the feuilletons and the coffee - table discussions: what is masochism, really? When a woman is a masochist, and she chooses it, isn't she really the one in control?...blah, blah, blah. It's a film! Not a think piece in the Sunday paper!

89,mpofarrell,SONATA OF DESPAIR,10,19 July 2002,"Watching  director  Michael  Haneke's  French - language  film  LA PIANISTE  [ THE  PIANO  TEACHER ]  brings to mind  another work  it   shares  an affinity with ,  Stanley  Kubrick's  chilling meditation  on violence ,  A CLOCKWORK  ORANGE.  Although they  are  stylistically  quite different ,  both films  are  directed with a  cool  clinician's  eye  and  photographed  and scored  with  an unsettling  dichotomy  between  image  and  sound.  In  Kubrick's 1971 adaptation of  Anthony  Burgess'  futuristic novel  of gang rampage ,  scenes of  rape  are  accompanied  on  the  soundtrack by  the exuberant  strains of  Rossini's  "" La  gazza  ladra "" and  the happy  go  lucky  crooning of  Gene  Kelly's  ""Singing in the Rain "". LA  PIANISTE is  brimming  with  the gorgeous  music of  Franz Schubert  ,  often  showcased in  appropriate  scenes of music recitals  but  at other times  as background  music  for  settings best  described  as  unseemly.  To  be  forced  to  listen  to Schubert  piano  sonatas  and  trios ,  to  take in the luxurious sounds of a baritone  singing  wistful  Schubert  lieder in a film this unpleasant  is  something  of a  masterstroke  [  and  sick   joke ] on  the  part  of  the  filmmaker.Erika  Kohut , a  brilliant  piano  instructor  at  an  esteemed Austrian  Music  Conservatory ,  wields  an  exacting  hand  over her  select  young   students.  Uncompromising  in  her  criticism , she  also  proves  unyielding to  those  especially  vulnerable.  As portrayed  by  Isabelle  Huppert  ,  she  is  an  unbending  foil to both  students  and   fellow  associates.  In  one  of  the  movie's key  scenes ,  a  discussion  among  music  jurors  in  deciding who  to  pick  for  admission  to  the  School ,  Erika  throws  an unnecessary  wrench  into  the  proceedings , objecting vehemently  to  the  unanimous  approval  of  a  gifted   contestant , much  to  the  consternation of  the  committee.What  her  fellow   co-workers  and  students have  no knowledge of  is  the  bleak  and  desperate  private  life  that  consumes  Erika outside  of  the  classroom  situation.  An  attractive  woman  in  her 40's ,  she  shares  an  apartment  with  her  elderly  ,  domineering mother [ Annie  Girardot].  When  Erika  arrives  home  hours  after her  last  class ,  her  mother  is  waiting , ready  to  browbeat  her defiant  daughter  at  every  turn.  Both  are  unhappy  women , and they  are  not  above  physically  slapping  each  other  during heightened   arguments.   They  even  share  the  same  bedroom , with  the  two  beds   pushed together. This  close  proximity induces an  atmosphere of   incredible  tension  between  mother and  daughter  ;  no  explanations  are given  in  Mr.  Haneke's screenplay   for  why  these  two  are  so  pathetically  dependent on  each  other ,  but  as  depicted  it  is  obviously  a  situation  that has  lasted ,  and  festered , for  years.With  the  emergence  of  a  handsome ,  charmingly  arrogant young  man  in  one  of  Erika's  Master  Classes ,  the  movie takes  a  dramatic  turn  that  brings  both  teacher  and  student  to a  realization  that  neither  one  expects .  Hostile  to  his  romantic overtures ,  Erika  is   nevertheless  attracted  to  his  schoolboy crush  on  her ;  slowly  but  inevitably   Erika's  ice  cold  demeanor begins  to  crack ,  but  instead  of  warming  up  she  presents vulgar  demands during  their  brief  courtship  that  prove  so  inept and  disastrous  that  they  backfire ,  leading  to disastrous consequences.This  is  not  an  easy  movie  to  like.  It is one  that  I  admire.  It lays  bare  the  life  of  an  immensely  gifted  artist  who , although disciplined  in  her  love  of  music  and  work ,  has  no  outer  life to  speak  of.  The  movie  does  not  explain  the  reasons  why; perhaps  that  is  better  left  to  reading  the  novel.  Haneke seems  interested  in  observing objectively .  Erika  is  such  an amalgam of  self  hate ,  spite  and  jealousy  that  it  is  a  miracle we  sit  in  the  theater  and  watch  her  at  all.  That  we  do  is  a testament  to  the  genius  of  Isabelle  Huppert ,  who  gives  one of  those  rare , monumental  performances  that  burns  up  the screen.  Somehow  she  is  able  to  project  the  despairing humanity  that  inhabits  Erika, so  that  even  when  she  indirectly perpetrates  a  vicious act  of  cruelty  on  an  unsuspecting student ,  we  continue  to  watch.This is not a film  for  everyone.  Erika's  night -time  forays  to  sex shops  and  drive - in  theaters  are  not  the  stuff of  mainstream entertainment ;  but  as  a  character  study of  one  gifted but unfulfilled  individual ,  this  movie  is  unflinching  in  its  honesty and  depiction  of  human  behavior.",The Piano Teacher

In 'the piano-player' the main attraction for me was the incredible acting of Huppert as the tormented teacher , but the silly & predictable ending kind of destroyed the film for me...(when the end was coming up...all i was thinking was...oooh please , don't let this be the ending....but ,predictably , is was...)so , great atmospherically sketches , great acting , weak fragmented story..predictable ending.",The Piano Teacher
91,Jose E,A big letdown - sinks midway,4,8 November 2001,"This is one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen, and I assure you I have seen a few. I think it let me down more because it was supposed to be good and tasty, but it was not.Although the plotlines are different, this movie falls apart midway as Holy Smoke does. Both of them are apparently ambitious but halfway all ideas (At least those that make sense!) simply fade away, and the viewer is left to witness an hour or so full of absurd situations. Looks like the writers got tired at that point and started adding every stupid idea to the script (Or maybe they took some acid or something!). WARNING! - SPOILERS.La Pianiste's premise seems appealing, but once Erika (Isabelle Huppert's character) breaks loose the film goes nowhere and the action becomes strained. It's not the actress' fault (In fact, she does a great job) but the writers'. This film could have used a bit more of sensibility to approach the end with more believable situations, but instead the writers turn Erika into an impredictable and pathetic woman that lets all hell break loose after a self-restraint life. During the first hour or so, the movie is watchable. The main character is a harsh piano teacher that happens to live with her conservative and pain-in-the-ass mum. Unfortunately, after her first come-but-go sexual encounter with that man things go downhill pretty fast. Erika's character goes literally nuts, wanting him to recreate on her every degrading sexual fantasy she has seen or read about. Needless to say I am NOT a prude nor I am outraged by those fantasies, but all goes wrong since. Some of the scenes in her house the last time that bloke comes see her in the night are downright stupid and disgusting, if nothing else because they are unnecessary and don't fit. I guess you could say she finally gets what she deserves, but if I were that guy I could not slap her, no matter how wild she was driving me. This part of the movie I could do without, definitely. I was just not ready to see any physical abuse. And what the hell is the end supposed to mean? Her standing everyone up in the concert hall does make sense but, before that, what can we deduce from her stabbing herself under her left shoulder? Any ideas?It's real hard to rate this mess as it deserves. I'm gonna give it four out of ten because of the acting and the first hour.

About that time Erika goes into a porno shop stall for dirty movies and takes soiled tissue out of the garbage can to smell it. Then she goes home and uses a razor on her genitals. At this point I pulled the plug on this thing.I am sorry---life is too short--I don't need these horrible images troubling my subconscious mind.How perfect the author won a Nobel prize.

An oppressive mother, marvellously acted by Annie Girardot, and her ""pianist"" daughter, giantly performed by Isabelle Huppert are the elements of this theatrical film which shows the decline of the femininity of a young ""mind sick"" lady who has a double life. The appearance of a severe and slightly sadic piano teacher hides her real double side personality, perverse and ""voyeuristic"". The toilet scene is as crude as deep and uncommunicative. Rarely in a film, such a high level of expression as this one has been achieved. The teacher is pitiless and full of frigidity complexes, her personality is completely analysed and dissected by Michael Haneke getting finally a rainbow. Rating: 8/10",The Piano Teacher
95,larrysmile1,Weird and Perverted - Should have an Adult X rating.,7,8 September 2002,"Whenever I persuade myself to view a French film, I am usually disappointed afterwards.  Such is the case for La Pianiste (or the English title -- The Piano Teacher).I had no problem with the English subtitles.  What I found disturbing was the story and the method that the movie scenes were composed.This film came to East Central Illinois as an un-rated Art film.  I would have rated it as an Adult Film with an ""X"" tag for it's sexual content and graphic depiction of sexual acts in certain scenes.Only three actors need to be commented on: Isabelle Ann Huppert, Benoit Magimel, and Annie Suzanne Girardot.Ms. Huppert looked every bit of her middle age of 46 years when this film was made in 2001.  Granted that she was supposed to look plain and mousy as a virgin and sexual deviant music Professor at a Viennese Music Conservatory, but, a little cover-up makeup would have minimized all the natural freckles this actress possesses.  Ms. Huppert with 81 films completed since she started acting at aged 16 years is obviously well-qualified.  However, the script relies mostly on her not saying words and using her facial distortions to relate the story.  It is weird to see a story whereby the female lead is so sexually frustrated as a primary plot. Erika Kohut sexually teases Walter Klemmer by performing manual and oral sex acts upon him to set him up for her further intense desires.  Most women would not want to relate to such a storyline.  Younger Benoit Magimel, 28 years old, is also a veteran French actor having completed 25 film projects since he started acting at age 14.  Mr. Magimel was very well suited for the part as a younger male, Walter Klemmer, seeking entry into Professor Erika Kohut's selective piano music class.  He becomes enamored with his teacher, yet, it would appear most unlikely that having known her for such a brief period that he should profess to her that he ""loves"" the older woman.  Magimel eventually carries out Professor Kohut's perverted sexual instructions and ""plays the game"" by physically mistreating her and raping her on her apartment floor.Ms. Girardot is a 71 year old Parisian veteran actress with 131 film projects.  She plays Erika's live at home mother who dominates her spinster daughter in an overly protective manner.  Her performance is right on character and done well.What I find upsetting about this film is it's lack of intelligent dialogue, assuming that the English subtitles faithfully parallels the spoken French language.  Further, as with many European films, too much is attempted to be displayed visually and it bogs down the storyline.  Choppy and meaningless scenes take up some valuable film time which could be better used with more dialogue between the major players.  Some scenes were outright confusing and didn't advance the story.  No mention of Professor Kohut's father was made during the story, except when Erika comes home late one night after her usual perverted visit to an adult store where she engages in viewing adult videos with explicit sexual acts. Her mother screams at her demanding to know where she has been, as if she were a child, and slaps her in the face and blurts out that ""Your father died.""  The scene is cut and no further mention of Erika's father or any emotion is shown.  As there was no mention of her father before, and it is obvious that the mother and daughter live together, any reference to Erika's father is a waste of film and doesn't advance the story.Another scene of importance lacked the attention to detail of which the well-known director Michael Haneke should have been aware.  When Professor Kohut wields the ""knife"" as a weapon, there should have been at least a little theater blood on the tip of the knife, especially when a close-up is used to show this portion of the plot.  When Ms. Huppert nonchalantly walks out of the Conservatory building into the night streets of Vienna the film ends leaving the audience without a hint of what was to happen next.  It's like the director said: ""oops, end of time, end film, movie's over!"" 
As mentioned, I find European movie-story telling much different from American movie-story telling.  I am sure that books written in other countries don't tell such choppy tales nor ends so abruptly.  It's just lazy film making, in this reviewer's viewpoint.Whereas, some newspaper movie reviewers gave this film raves and four-stars, I disagree.  Just because it's a weird film and has perverted sexual experiences for a woman doesn't warrant that high a rating.  Two stars is the maximum!",The Piano Teacher
96,bgood26,Isabelle Huppert shines,7,23 August 2003,"""La Pianiste"" (""The Piano Teacher"") is a character-driven French film about the descent into obsession, perfectionism, and self-abuse. Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) is a 40-ish single woman, a successful professor of music at the Vienna Conservatory. She still lives with her mother, or maybe I should say her mother lives with her, since Erika is the obvious bread-winner. Anyway, Mom (Annie Girardot) is a domineering woman whose suffocating control of Erika leads the Professor to escape any way she can, including viewing pornography.In addition to her teaching at the Conservatory, Erika gives private lessons to young students, where, she is demanding, angry, and horribly critical. She thinks nothing of breaking the spirits of two of her students (both of whom have more musical talent than I can ever dream). In one particularly disturbing scene, she crushed a wine glass and poured the fragments into the coat pocket of Anna (Anna Schober), a student who could never measure up to her ridiculously high standards. The poor unsuspecting girl, who idolized her instructor, ended up cutting a nerve in her hand.Another student is Walter (Beniot Magimel), a remarkably talented pianist who seems to have more passion for his Erika than his music. Immediately after Anna cuts her hand, the couple start getting it on in the ladies' room at the Conservatory. No doubt the attack turns her on. Their kinky sexual activities continue for some time, with her controlling the relationship.Walter falls in love with his instructor, but she tells him in a letter that she is into masochistic sex, including being blindfolded, tied up, and beaten. She keeps a box of sex toys under her bed and shows him some of them. He is so repulsed by this that he rejects Erika, calling her pathetic and a host of other names. Their roles become reversed: at first, he was obsessed with her, following her around like a puppy, letting her dominate and give the orders. But now, she is obsessed, following him around, begging him to dominate her.I think they could have developed some of the relationships better, especially between Erika and Mom. While the script could have been better, the acting was superb. Both Huppert and Magimel won acting awards at the Cannes Film Festival, the most prestigious in the world. One thing I found interesting is that Erika was such an angry woman; she didn't smile once during the entire movie.*SPOILER* At the very end of ""The Piano Teacher,"" Erika is to take Anna's place at a recital at the Conservatory. Among the audience are Erika's peers, her mother, Walter, and Anna and her mom, neither of whom have any idea that it was Erika who destroyed Anna's dream of playing piano. Whether out of guilt, pressure, embarrassment, or self-loathing, Erika pulls a knife out of her purse, stabs herself in the shoulder, and walks away into the night. I think the moviegoer is asked to decide why on his/her own.",The Piano Teacher
97,akoaytao1234,An Tantalizing Experience,10,29 June 2021,"There is a weird sense of truth when you finish this film. Its difficult really to put into words that feeling. A film about a sadomasochistic woman who pleasure herself both personally and sexually by breaking things apart, is never an easy draw for any viewer. But if you look in, there is something very magnetic about it AND something universal with how the Piano teacher is feeling.She hides within her little world, but you can see a façade that is universal. She want control, she wants to be on top. She never tells her true desire but waits for a one who maybe could. But once in, you see an an empty shell, towered by personal trauma and insecurities and you can understand it. She crumbles and build a bigger world alone.Towards the end, you ask yourself will she grow into something. I felt that, maybe not. She is still the same. More miserable now knowing she tried to open doors but failed.Its just insane watching this film. It has layers that is uncomfortable yet also feels too real. I love it. It is the kind of confounding BS that I love. Because it puts me in a place I never would have imagine, and maybe not understand but feel empathic about. I do not know if I would personally watch this things again, because its a difficult film to get through but try it at least once. There is something here that would make you think AND also maybe introspect yourself. 5/5PS. Kudos to Huppert who handled the role magnificently. She wonderous BUT imagine Meryl Streep trying roles like this. She is highly studied/controlled and economic with her acting, same qualities that makes Huppert's performances amazing tbh.",The Piano Teacher
98,PrashunChakraborty,Another gem by Haneke,9,8 June 2017,"Michael Haneke has a knack for creating odd or even disturbing scenes or characters out of the most mundane situations and this is on full display in The Piano Teacher. Anchored by Issabelle Huppert, a very competent support cast who hold their own and wonderful classical music (Schubert's iconic piano number from Barry Lyndon makes a return among other melodious pieces) this film explores the dark recesses of Erika's mind, her struggle with loneliness and her unconventional desires. Erika is forty years old and lives with her domineering and controlling mother. She is an overtly strict, harsh piano teacher but behind this persona lies a vulnerable woman who is so sexually repressed that it has given rise to her odd and unconventional sexual needs. Erika's sexual desires are perhaps the weirdest I have ever seen in film, she's into BDSM, humiliation, voyeurism and even self mutilation, she's definitely a very perverse character which is brought up later on as well. Through all this, we can often lose sight of the fact that even Erika longs for and deserves happiness but she will go about it her own self destructive way. When a new far younger student Walter enters her life she tries to push him away but they eventually start a romance. Walter wants to have a traditional romantic relationship but Erika wants her needs fulfilled by a session of rape and humiliation, it's interesting that she desires the pain and humiliation when she inflicts the same on her students, her desire to be on the receiving side of these emotions makes the viewer always trying to decipher Erika, what's really going on in her head?",The Piano Teacher
99,rivera66_99,Disappointing,6,5 October 2001,"I think one of the main problems of this film is that it tries to create ""fire under ice"" by showing a possible counterpart to Erika Kohut's perversion: 'true love' or something like that. This is the purpose of the 'improvement' of Walter Klemmer's character, the only but decisive difference from the book's mainshape. This intent fails, necessarily as I think. The strength of Elfriede Jelinek's terrific novel consisted in his completely negative attitude towards sexuality, almost identifying its point of view with that of Erika - but as the latter was unbearable, too, and obviously sick, the reader had no choice except finding a solution in a complete negation of the space of the piece. Haneke, on the other hand, tries to tell the story didactically: We have to listen to shallow and stupid phrases like: ""You are not able to love, Erika"", ""I won't feel anything"" and so on, phrases that EXPLAIN something that was sufficiently SHOWN by Huppert's stunning performance and by the whole plot; while Benoits Klemmer is supposed to be the charming, 'sincere' boy who would do it all right if the piano teacher only let him. So, the whole thing becomes a boring tale about sickness and health, with health as the less convincing part. Possibly, this intelligent director did a mistake in conceiving the topic as a DRAMA instead of a baudelairean POEM; perhaps the problem is deeply generic and it was impossible to make a good movie from DIE KLAVIERSPIELERIN. However, the result is one that will confirm all fans of Mme. Huppert and disappoint the fans of Haneke's cinema.",The Piano Teacher
100,denizov,A disturbing and depressing but interesting journey into human psyche,6,6 October 2004,"This film is definitely not easy to watch.It is a Freudian story about the complexities and often dark aspects of human psyche.The film pays homage to Freud and if you share Freud's views of human psyche then you will like the film.As it is a complex film many themes are intertwined and this,I think,makes the film intriguing .It certainly is not a boring film and not a commonplace one.All the actors play brilliantly taking into consideration that the roles are VERY demanding.At the end things get rather nasty and probably they should have been more subtly presented.The ending is very embarrassing.As if it again proves Freud's somewhat pessimistic view of human nature-that drives and society's norms are irreconciable.Yet there is hope albeit not a great one. The attitude of the viewer change from pity to anger to sympathy.Yes,this is a complex film worth watching but do not read the book-it is one of the worst books I have ever read-totally disgusting.Jelinek has won the Nobel prize for literature but i strongly dislike her.This is not the way modern literature should take!",The Piano Teacher
101,Latheman-9,I saw this movie over 30 years ago.,4,13 February 2003,"I rented the video of ""The Piano Teacher"" knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box. I did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category. About one quarter of the way into it I found myself saying out loud, ""This movie is boring."" About half way through I was saying to myself, ""Where have I seen this before?"" At the three quarters mark I had figured it out.In spite of its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman's much earlier (1969), and better, ""That Cold Day in the Park."" Although the details obviously differ and Altman's work was more plot-driven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing ""new"" to be seen in this production. Every aspect of it has been done before: a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant"" 1992); a perverse and doomed 'love' culminating in an operatic (near) death scene (David Cronenberg's ""M. Butterfly"" 1993); uncommonly brutal sex scenes (David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" 1986); and so on. Hence, I am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be ""shocking,"" ""shattering,"" etc. This highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. However, I largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film-viewing experience. See enough movies and you really will, eventually, have seen it all. And while it is true that I saw the expurgated 'R-rated' version, I doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of ""The Piano Teacher.""Technically, the film is not without merit. There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. This is the first of Haneke's films that I've seen, and if I were to see more I expect I would have the same opinion of him that I have of Ferrara: an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be. Rating: 4/10.",The Piano Teacher
102,POG-2,An excellent film - but hard to digest,9,10 December 2001,"I totally disagree with the comments of one of the critics before me who bashed the film. Having read the book, being impressed by it although this is a kind of literature that you cannot really LIKE (similar to Hubert Selby's writing) I expected being shocked but the effect was more subtle than this. Isabelle Hubert is a brilliant actress who manages to convey a multi-layered character. There are many scenes that totally focus on her and her subtle changes and I can imagine few actresses who would do so well, with so much disregard for their own reputation or image. There is this coldness, distance, cruelty and at the same time there's this helplessness, hurt and pain. There's a person who's in control and controlled at the same time. Maybe this is not realistic - although when you read the newspaper you'll read about much worse than this - but there's a truth to it that is very difficult to bear. I think it's an excellent film but I did not enjoy watching it.It's not boring but there are times when I wished it would end. BTW, her male counterpart is very well acted as well (and I think well chosen, too).",The Piano Teacher
103,bliss66,See this for Isabelle Huppert,9,21 April 2002,"As with all Haneke films, make your own decision--don't be swayed by what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends, see it yourself.  Isabelle Huppert is stunning in this film--combined with Haneke, these two never pull their punches. Haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy,  Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller.  You'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly nervy and thought provoking; Haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitised Western civilization is or has become.  People may turn their noses up at this but it's only taking what Solondz did in Happiness a few steps further.  While grounded in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor.  I'm not recommending it but I wouldn't dissuade you either...it definitely divides people but given it's largely about repression--that's no surprise.",The Piano Teacher

105,bootlebarth,Dull sensationalism masquerading as 'art',3,21 June 2008,"Elfriede Jelinek, not quite a household name yet, is a winner of the Nobel prize for literature. Her novel spawned a film that won second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes?'Gobble, gobble' is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners.The embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. It begins very badly, as if made to annoy the viewer. Credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress, a stony professor of piano. She lives with her husky and domineering mum. Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action.Reviewing The Piano Teacher is difficult, beyond registering its unpleasantness. What we see in the film (and might read in the book, for all I know) is a tawdry, exploitative, nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on.Erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed. Not quite, because there's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies. If a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do), Elrika's violently alternating moods would be it.A young hunk, Walter, studying to become a 'low voltage' engineer, whatever that is, and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments, is also a talented pianist. He encounters Elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the glib fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme'.Repressed Erika has a liking for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches.Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation.He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over her lovesick swain. She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges.In the meantime, chillingly jealous because of Walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert, Erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass, causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands.The next big scene (by-passing the genital self-mutilation, etc) has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother. Erika want to be humiliated, bound, slapped, etc. Sensible Walter is, for the moment, repulsed and marches off into the night.At this point there's still nearly an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers. His 'baby gravy' is soon expelled with other stomach contents. Ho hum.Repulsed but hooked, perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what happens now? It's not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. One moment he's locking maman in her room and slapping Erika, the next he's kicking her in the face, having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love. Am I being unfair in this summary? Watch the film if you want, but I'd advise you not to.Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood. I could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted. But I 'prefer not to', because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing.I'm supposed to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love, ineffectively seeks it in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt, blah, blah, blah.The world has, for reasons not explained, stunted her. She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist, because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise.At the end, if you have the patience to be there, there's a small twist. Before going to the final scene, where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands, Erika packs a knife in her handbag. For Walter?Yes, you're ahead of me. She stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves. Roll credits.If this earned the second prize at Cannes, just how bad were the rest of the entries?",The Piano Teacher
106,dingoberserk,A rather crude way of providing titillation for voyeurs,2,7 June 2006,"Although it seems difficult to take La Pianiste seriously, it contains one feature which is reasonably credible: Erika Kohut's bureaucratic, heartless approach to her students. She seems incapable of grasping the simple fact that people (especially young people), when embarking on a tough career path, deserve every bit of encouragement rather than frequent put-downs and humiliations (let alone broken glass in their coat pockets). Is Kohut a metaphor for nazi Austria? The remainder of the movie appears to be the product of a troubled mind with rather naive views on human feelings and emotions. The hapless viewer is asked to believe that: two seemingly diverse, incompatible people will fall so deeply 'in love' (expressed with 'je t'aime') that they need to impetuously lower/raise some of their garments in public toilets and gymnasium store rooms to indulge in amateurish, not obviously enjoyable sex practices which one would have thought were confined to the under-15's. (What are hotel rooms for?). Kohut's letter detailing the services expected of her male partner would be funny if it wasn't so boring. Not having read Jelinek's novel, I would not wish to comment on her input, but it doesn't look like Nobel Prize material to me.",The Piano Teacher
107,nikhilthemacho,Boring,2,17 May 2020,There's not much happening in this movie. The acting is seriously mediocre. The storyline based on the book is a waste. I had heard lot of trash was being passed around as art. Now I have seen it too.,The Piano Teacher
108,gracehenson-30790,"Creepy, Disturbing, and Unforgettable",9,19 August 2020,"The Piano Teacher isn't one of those movies that one simply sees late one night and forgets by the next morning. It's taken me a full week to try and digest what I saw. It's not an easy movie by any stretch of the imagination.The film deals with Erika - a repressed piano professor at an arts conservatory who still lives with her mother well into middle age and spends her evenings lurking in drive-ins to watch young couples have sex through their car windows among other creepy things. Everything changes when she develops an obsession with a new student and it sends her life spiraling out of control.Isabelle Huppert is perfection in the title role, giving a brave and daring performance that very few would have been comfortable with. She never tries to soften up her character or give the audience an easy ""in"" to feel empathy for her. It's a remarkable performance and it anchors the entire film.Much like Huppert, the film itself only presents the facts and allows us to make up our own minds in how we feel about this woman and her issues.",The Piano Teacher
109,matty03,What's It All About,10,8 June 2002,"Without question, this is a powerful and well crafted film. It features two amazing performances. It seems to generate a great deal of anger, frustration and confusion. After seeing the film I began to think about what it was trying to say. I could be wrong, but I think this is far more than an examination of sexual perversity or a woman's tragic journey of self hate. I think this is a very adult view of what is slowly taking over western civilization; facisim. The piano teacher is a victim of it, just as is society.  If you've seen the film think back on what happens and how it is filmed.  Think of the music used --- and the ultimate realization that the fantasy may not be the reality we really want ---- and certainly not what is needed.  Maybe I am reading more into the movie than what is really there, but I think not. This is a brave work of art that has something to say.  It provides the message through the story of a repressed woman on a journey which goes beyond self-destruction. Fascinating film making.",The Piano Teacher
110,sundog1,Give it a day to sink in,10,6 June 2003,"Yes, I felt like I had been gutted after first seeing it. But not until the next day did I begin to see the true brilliance of this creation. I won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is one new area I want to touch on... **SPOILERS** Why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? Most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance. I must disagree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage. The student is quite an expressive girl (crying & vocalizing her fears)- just the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the film, after the girl is injured, when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly upset, states ""We gave up everything so she could study piano"" and Huppert immediately snaps ""You mean SHE gave up everything, don't you.""So it was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. She didn't want the girl to end up like HER, repressed & hardened, condemned to a life of recitals...gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. Maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago, before things grew bad. Maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age. Is she ruining the student's life, or simply freeing her?For me, that realization made all the difference in what I experienced through this film. Brilliant.",The Piano Teacher
111,Vince-40,You can't stay indifferent...,8,7 December 2001,"First of all, I must say that I love this film.It was the first film that I saw from director Micheal Haneke and I was impressed that how good the direction was good !Haneke surely knows how to direct actors. What I found intresting is also Haneke's scenario. At first, you saw a woman who is very straight and seems to be a good piano teacher and very well loved and respected from everybody in her entourage. Then you realise that she has a mother who is a controle freak and is too much present in her life. Now you know that she is deranged, that she has emotional problems, but you don't know exactly what. And then you fall into her dark side, but her dark side is only reveal when a student sendenly fall in love with her. She can't controled herself anymore.The roles are very complexed and difficult to play, but Isabelle Huppert is marvellous in her role and she deserves the recognition she had at Cannes Festival. Benoit Maginel is very solid too, but a little bit eclipse by Huppert's performance.There is one thing that I found strange in the scenario is how the character played by Magimel is not very credible. He is too talented! It is rare that a person is a piano virtuoso, but pass the most of the his time to play hockey and study... It think that it is a weak point, but only a minor flaw.I just saw the movie once, so I can't do a very complete critic, because I didn't analysed the movie. I like what I saw ! so I give the film a 8.5/10Oh yeah... as for the end, Haneke showed that he really wanted to shock his audience. A motivation that don't think is necessary to make movies, but Haneke does it with style and precision, that is why his film is better than Baise-Moi for example.Vince",The Piano Teacher
112,Franco-23,A faithful portrayal of a weird character,8,27 May 2003,"The portrayal of the two main characters is well achieved... the dominant mother afraid of ""losing"" her daughter... the talented daughter who is emotionally unfit... and then all the consequences that such personalities could bring. The film turns around and you can't exactly know what the main player (an excellent Isabelle Huppert)is thinking of doing next. It is definitely a non-traditional film that you should see ideally with somebody who wouldn't be easily shocked (or disturbed) and with whom you may spend a while discussing it afterwards.",The Piano Teacher
113,jboyaquar,Hanekian Brutality,8,6 June 2007,"Confrontations with ones emotional hollowness and inability to engage in physical love doesn't get more harrowing than in Haneke's typically masochistic study of incomplete individuality and the facades we publicly offer to assure ourselves of a full life. Despite existing in a world of gorgeous, soulful music that stirs the heart, an instructor finds herself incapable of communicating with the smallest amount of grace and decency in order to assist her frazzled students. Should it be a surprise then, that something more than failure is met when a chance at a meaningful physical connection is offered. Despite veering off in foolish and stagy extremes during its last few minutes, this is a believably inexorable experience. Huppert is perfectly suited, with her severe brow and her uncanny introverted instincts, like Nathalie Baye, to play women who succeed in wringing out every last potentiality of pain in her characters. However, I did disapprove of Magimel's casting as his leering eyes lasciviously undress 'Erika' from the onstart. Klemmer's character should be aware of his uncommon talent, but more oblivious to his own sexiness and charms. Then, his longing for'Erika' and its eventual unraveling would have been doubly heart-renderingly tragic - for him as well as for her.",The Piano Teacher
114,psp777,A Teacher of piano teaches just piano - oui?,8,29 January 2006,"The more 'disturbing' scenes are in fact very disturbing and the gut reaction is to alienate ourselves from the characters in the scene as layer after layer of human vulnerability is exposed. The photography, whilst close up is hardly pornographic - there's no need as the story carries itself.Although a simple comment - Its really a brilliant title -for this film- - ""The Piano Teacher"" - ask yourself - what ELSE could this be about? A Teacher of piano teaches piano oui? Whilst what I am about to say may appear trivial - but I hope you'll agree it has a point... If the film and all its posters were British - then the mere title may serve to suggest eccentric behaviour or perhaps a piano teacher who has other gifts.BUT lets not fool ourselves we're - The posters and promo promise its a deliciously dark European masterpiece - and we know that *THIS* piano teacher is going to be a strong catalyst on many sensual levels.The pathos and inner journey(s) of the film keeps the subliminal metronome perfectly swinging.I would urge you to see this film to realise how complex it becomes when the object of your (love) desire wants to receive emotions & actions reserved for a masochist - but wants it ALL their own way.",The Piano Teacher
115,aethomson,Passionate Playing,8,22 January 2012,"Haneke country. We all live uncomfortably close to the edge of a cliff, the edge of sanity. But, unlike a physical abyss, it's sometimes difficult to determine exactly when our character flaws, our eccentric personalities, our neurotic tendencies, our insecurities, our unsatisfiable sexual needs, our emotional baggage, our social tensions and our accumulated pain will slide us over the edge, into illness. We're in Freudsville, aka Vienna - even though most of the dialogue is in French (English subtitles). They take their music seriously. Their serious music. Schubert (Viennese), Schumann (German). The lives of both these composers were shortened by syphilis, with years of insanity for the latter. Good coaching or teaching, what is it? - mostly constructive bullying. And perfectionist Erika Kohut is tough on the kids who come to the conservatory for her music lessons. She's brutal. It's for their own good - drive the talented hard, and drive the untalented out. But we soon learn that she's not a happy person. The (love-hate?) relationship with her mother (they live together) is too intense. She frequents an establishment that provides private viewing of porn. And she craves self-destructive risk-taking.It's time for Games People Play (yep, the book by Eric Berne). Subconsciously they recognise each other as players: Ms White, Mr Black. He's a promising student, half her age, rather too good-looking. But he turns out to be a shallow young male (what did you expect?), a self-centred, over-sexed twerp, conventional, unimaginative. But isn't that what she ""really"" wants? - the humiliation of his prissy repulsion, the violence of his bewilderment? From Isabelle Huppert we expect a dazzling performance, and we get it. Perhaps this is a movie about Michael Haneke making movies? Like a piano teacher, the film director has to squeeze a perfect work of art out of performers who may be brilliant - but they'll never be quite brilliant enough. Will a ferocious pursuit of artistic perfection provoke an over-reaction, a perilous emotional backlash? For Erika it does.",The Piano Teacher
116,claudiaeilcinema,A Compelling Shoker,8,23 May 2009,"Isabelle Huppert must be one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. ""La Pianiste"" truly confirms it. As if that wasn't enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of the greatest actresses of her or any other generation. So, as you may well imagine, those pieces of casting are worth the horror we're put through. Isabelle and Annie play characters we've never seen before on the screen. A mother and daughter yes but with such virulent fearlessness that sometimes I was unable even to blink or to breath. Personally, I don't believe in the director's intentions, I don't believe they (the intentions that is) go beyond the shocking anecdote and the ending made me scream with frustration but I was riveted by the story written in the face of the sensational Huppert and the fierceness of Girardot's strength.

117,cineaste-4,Huppert Enlarges my Heart,8,12 June 2002,"Aside from documentaries and newsreels, I've always been aware that films are stories performed by actors in a representation of life.  Some are simply entertainments, many are trivial, but there are a few I've found to be extraordinarily powerful.  Always with those few, it's been the actors inside their characters that have deeply touched me.  Actors are the greatest ""special effect"".  Frequently, it's been a well-acted characterization of an ordinary person that has impressed me (e.g. Brenda Blethyn's Cynthia in ""Secrets and Lies""). Sometimes, the character has a personality unlike anyone I've ever known. Always, though, the actors have instilled in me a far deeper understanding and empathy than I'd ever have in my own life for individuals such as these. My very humanity has been enlarged.That is the case with Isabelle Huppert's performance as ""The Piano Teacher"". Since the film makes a good point about the possibility of not knowing what might lurk below the surface of a friend or relative's persona, I can't be certain that I've never met somebody like Erika Kohut.  I can say that I thought I'd never comprehend how someone could be masochistic, ""enjoy"" pain and desire humiliation.  After witnessing Huppert's performance, I've begun to understand.The amazement aroused in me by ""great acting"" is one treasured response to the art.  A larger heart is another.  This film has flaws, to be sure.  It isn't fun.  It is riveting, though, if you admire the power of transcendent acting.

We wish and hope that Erika could be saved or cured by Walter, but it is no surprise at the end where Erika accepts that there is no hope or future for her.Similarly when Walter reveals his ruthlessness and callousness, we couldn't altogether condemn him  rather we feel an inner sadness at the baseness of human beings and their capability to inflict suffering despite having what starts out as the best of motives.Altogether a disturbing film and not for the faint-hearted with some nice directorial touches  particularly the way Erika and Walter seem to change their appearances throughout which keeps the audience's attention and interest.

Benoît Magimel also shows his talent like he's never done it before. Their acting here is indeed astounding. But this movie is nothing but sickening. I am sorry i can't be objective, as i hate everything Haneke shot so far. I especially can't stand the mute credits (ridiculous signature he's satisfied with) and the french dubbing of the austrian actors. Looks like a bad TV series... I don't like the way he gets the audience trapped either. Very simply, very ""cowardly"" i would say. Only with sex. Of course that's the main topic of the movie, but i guess he's definitely the kind of director who cannot show everything without getting pathetic. He pitifully make attempts to describe Erika's sickness with ""easy scenes"". Yes i think scenes like when she's in the sexshop or when she lets herself be raped (cause i think she does) are ""easy scenes"". I expected those from the beginning. And there is no need to precise i did not read the book though. There no surprise at all during all the film. The worst about it it that it didn't make me at all want to read that book. It seems Haneke only kept the pervert aspect of it, and, though i don't know why, i'm sure there's more involved in it. That's what i meant by ""sickening movie"". I really don't mind sex on screen (i'd even say i kind of like it) when the director is talented and more importantly, remains humble...

It is challenging, disturbing, and so full of newness it is overwhelming.  Once you realize it is one giant metaphor for control, seduction, and pain, it becomes a little easier to understand.  It is not a movie for the impatient, and the common John Woo fan should pass.  Be advised it does NOT follow the tired old Hollywood plots and movie conventions.  Also the fact it is not rated should give you some more clues as to some of the content...  If you have seen this movie, I am willing to bet it was not in a theater (in America).
The matter-of-fact filming is not quite as severe as it was in the director's other masterpiece, ""Code Inconnu"", but it is present here.  Long scenes with few cuts and little camera action lends the movie a feeling of reality, and we feel like a fly on the wall, as it were.

124,criztu,"Instead, try to realize the truth... you're in a movie, Anakin.",6,25 July 2019,"The story is a metaphor for something bigger. But just what kind of metaphor, that's for us to figure out. The more accesssible cyphers for me, are marxism and freudianism. The heroine - la pianiste, is the exploited class / death pulse, and the dude who wants her, is the oppressor class / life pulse.
H. Marcuse formulates a simple idea: the exploited are dehumanized, their development is distorted by the pressure applied to them, the masters' effort of turning them into.. something unlike them. The same theme is found in Alien, where the crew of a ship are corrupted into an alien slime. It's a ""social commentary"", heh..
Thus, the idea is, that the children of the exploited are reared into becoming performing robots, graded by the gatekeepers called ""teachers"". It may seem normal to many of us, to be graded by a teacher. But that's because we ourselves are twisted. We are blinded, we don't know what is sane. A sane man does not live to be graded, marked by a stranger who claims authority over him. A child does not grow sane, when placed under the authority of someone who doesn't care about him, but does it for money, to buy food and shelter, as they gaze into the abyss lying in wait at their right. A child needs to learn from someone who cares for him at a spiritual, emotional, affective level.And this is what La Pianiste might be. A portrait of the twisted perverted gatekeeper class, the butlers of the masters, the overseers of the massas, the hounds of the princes of the abyss.
They are innoculated by the masters with a grim directive: destroy the souls of the children of the slaves. Dehumanize them. Turn them into machines. Systematic destruction of the spirit - the piano teacher does not and can not figure out how to break free from that which corrupts her but also keeps her.. not alive.. but not dead... She has been thoroughly conditioned to ""love"" this mechanism, this tower of madness, governing her - mother. She is not allowed to have emotions, affection, spirit. Observe that the crew of the ship in the Alien movie is also guverned by ""mother"" - the computer of the corporation.Then, one of the princes of the abyss falls in love with the piano teacher. He discovers that she is sick, perverted, twisted, and so on. We hope - those of us who still think this is a story about a dude and a piano teacher falling in love - that he will fix her, make her see the light, redeem her or something.

If so, this would do no more than betray their lack of familiarity with those unusual, but not particularly rare, traits.To be clear; this is not the greatly symbolic film some ill-conceived reviews would have you believe. Instead, it's a fairly straightforward effort about a person with masochistic tendencies. Other than the fact that this person lives with her domineering, wheedling mother, we are told nothing of the life that led her to develop these tendencies, so we are left simply to observe the consequences of her having them. Those consequences range from somewhat interesting, particularly in the first part of the film, to mildly disturbing.The saving grace of the film is Isabelle Huppert's performance as Erika Kohut, ably supported by Annie Girardot as her mother. Unfortunately, the role of Walter Klemmer, unconvincingly written as it is, cannot be saved by Benoît Magimel and constitutes the film's major defect.If you're looking for some metaphysical profundity about the human condition or a cutting allegory about society, look elsewhere. This is a sometimes clumsy depiction of masochism and particularly of sadism partially, but not wholly redeemed, by some fine acting.",The Piano Teacher

Fantastic language ( Jellinek varies according to her books, some of it are too experimental for me : when proving that her characters 'are lost in translation 'and will never understand each othr, she de-composes her language into abstraction. But THIS one is written in a very emotional style, exactly the oppposite of what she shows her surrounding ( or in the film ) , then she is rigidly composed/repressed, don't forget this is not about the PIANISTE, but a deadly critique on her country Austria, and why they also censured her lots of times, it's about Austrian society + history ( the most repressed European country, very conservative, alwys been like this, and thus its artists ar the most extreme of Europee....!! always been like this, think of body-exprssionism-performances-with -blood-and -cuts in the 50-70s........

130,thieverycorp76,Intelligent drama with disturbing subject matter,8,12 June 2009,"Haneke captains another efficacious look into the human psyche with this compelling drama. His vessel of choice this time around is Isabelle Huppert and his voyage takes us far out into unchartered waters where most other captains fear to sail. Haneke leaves port and allows the passengers to gain understanding and appreciation for his vessel. She is small yet highly respected amongst her peers. Despite being built under assumingly harsh conditions her exterior is tough and she is built for the icy waters she frequents. Once our captain has sufficiently displayed the outer of his vessel and gained our respect, he then takes us below deck for a rare exhibit of the ship's viscera. What we see is distressing and unpleasant, however Hanke's ship has sailed and we are now headed for turbulent waters.Huppert gives a brilliant performance as the piano teacher. She beautifully executes both the character's controlled exterior as well as her hauntingly troublesome interior. Haneke's direction is focused and he delivers an unyielding character study that's potent and believable. This voyage is not for the weak of heart. Many will find the subject matter disturbing, and rightfully so, but it would be difficult to deny this masterfully created film the merit it deserves. I almost rated this film ten stars instead of eight, but I have difficultly giving the highest marks to a film I never plan to see a second time.",The Piano Teacher

I think Erika is the kind of character you simultaneously loathe and lament.  The most terrifying sex scene ever caught on film.  This is the best of Haneke's work so far.  He is the only living director to redefine pace since Kubrick.  The violence in this film is gorgeous.  In a word, the film is about self-hatred.

This film doesn't like women much, perhaps resembling it's maker and his influences.Only Isabelle Huppert's outstanding abilities make this watchable, even though the script is daft... the 'boy band' male lead is two dimensional and their relationship lacks credibility.

The most stunning part of it is that you start feeling compassion for the character Erika. Trash-Sexuality (no nudes scenes though), perversion, masochism, incestuous relations...Haneke gives us a crude meal, heavy to digest; sometimes, the only way you can escape the extremism of some scenes is to start laughing at it. The ""mise en scène"" is maybe not the most appealing part of the movie, it has obvious austro-germanic, sometimes scandinavian notes : static, long scenes, but never boring. The vienna settings, the french language used, make the whole look like a european blend. The permanent germanic music Background (Schubert) is beautifully chosen.

134,CWessonSpeaks,"Kiss Me... Kill Me - DANG, she likes it ROUGH!",5,23 May 2002,"NO SPOILERS!Reserved piano teacher, Erika Kohut (Isabelle Hubbert), pushing middle age by a thread and clearly at a breaking point, begins to obsess over sexuality or rather, the lack of sexuality in her life.   Employed by a music school and after hours giving private piano lessons, the plain, china-doll faced Erika longs for anything other than what she's got.   She lives with her foul and dominant mother whose vitriol only adds  fuel to Erika's already incredible level of self hatred.   Erika finds herself gawking at hardcore pornography with a virginal mix of revulsion and titillation.   We watch Erika's confused and blank face try to make sense of the wild exhibitions on the video screens of a local porno booth.  We watch her watch couples.  We watch her observe sexual rituals- in particular a wild moment at a drive-in. We watch her fight with her mother.  We watch her eyeball the young men that are students.   FINALLY, Erika picks out a handsome young piano student, Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is clearly interested in her cool repose.   Eventually the lines are crossed and Walter is passionately embracing Erika.  Her response again is one of childish titillation and revulsion.  She teases him mercilessly in what has already become a notorious sex scene in a public bathroom.   There's a longing, appropriately desperate sense to their sexual exchanges but the scene - pun intended, doesn't climax.  Walter, now clearly obsessed with the mixed signals that Erika flashes, is drawn closer to her.  When Erika supplies a sexual ultimatum involving her erotic torture and degradation, Walter finds it difficult to understand and unable to commit.   Erika starts to take a darker turn, cruelly lashing out at some of her pupils and her mother (much of the film's more controversial moments involve these aspects of the narrative) while she awaits the response of her unlikely suitor who may or may not perform the requested acts.Isabelle Huppert gives a fearless performance as Erika, the teacher in question and she manages to fill the character with a brooding combination of fawn-like innocence and whorish defiance.  It's a fine line and she walks it very well, even during the narrative's most incredible twists that don't seem especially motivated, she manages to pull it off with a dry, grim face. Director Michael Haneke probably best known for the controversial gratuity of his film Funny Games seems to have found the right tone for the story - but hasn't explored the terrain fully.  In a sense it's as if not even he understands her motivations and merely allows her to move about the narrative ready to burst with madness at any point.    Haneke seems an odd choice for this material but again, his controversial name probably assured financial backing for this film version of what is generally known as a powerful and politically infused novel by Elfriede Jelinek that has a loyal following.This maudlin sexual drama of The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste) is consistently interesting and provocative at best but it's also frustrating and incomplete.  You are left with the constant question: WHY?  There's a blankness here, you can't really figure out what the film's point is other than to try and explore sexual self-loathing.   Personally, I needed more to help me understand the depths of her depravity and the necessity of telling this particular tale.If anything, The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste)'s frankness will provoke discussion and much like an entry in the new and questionable 'female-in-deep-punishing-transgression' genre developed by Lars Von Trier, it is memorable.   Be Advised that the film is genuinely of an adult nature in terms of narrative and it also has what is best described as pornographic imagery (insertion, ejaculation etc.).   Those who are easily offended by that sort of material may want to steer clear of The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste). Those of you interested in a film that attempts to offers a frank exploration of sexual obsession and madness through a truly terrific performance by Ms. Hubbert, might be interested in seeing this.",The Piano Teacher

I'm a big Francophile and art film lover,  but I believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something ""arty"" or ""intellectual"" into something it is not.  I will be blunt:  it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that I never,  ever wanted to actually see. Obviously,  the piano teacher has some major psychological issues,  but I really did not want to see them displayed so graphically.  The film is,  in essence,  disgusting.  I mean,  when I saw Requiem for a Dream,  I was repulsed by the last sort of scene with Jennifer Connelly,  but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion I felt during this film.",The Piano Teacher
137,NBernard88,An awful woman in a wonderful film,9,22 December 2008,"Michael Haneke's film The Piano Teacher is a classic example of the proverb ""Be careful what you wish for"" Erika Kohut is a teacher at a conservatory of music who is a closeted masochist. She's talented but is very aloof and bitter. She lives a miserable life where she sleeps in the same bed as her mother that is very overprotective of her 40-year-old child (she looks in her closet for inappropriate clothing and hounds her about her whereabouts like she's 14). She seems to get off on making men uncomfortable. Walter, a student, who has no qualms in showing his attraction towards her, pursues her. Their first sexual encounter occurs after Erika does something horrible to one of her students. One example of this is when she walks into a porn shop (filled with only men) and brings a instant discomfort in the room.What makes Erika so fascinating is the way she carries herself. She's so uptight and defensive. It's no wonder how she got this far in life without anyone (aside from her mother) didn't know how insane she is. For the first half hour it's slightly difficult to understand her because she is so indecipherable. This aspect of her personality is the antithesis of Walter's. It's obvious what he is about from the beginning. He has a very high view of himself arguably higher than what he really is He has a care free aura about himself often associated with youth. When they first meet, Erika recoils even more but this is when her personality is most revealing. Much of the film Erika is not doing much of anything. She is mostly walking down the street, sitting in her room and other mundane things that contribute nothing to the plot. However, it never seems slow paced or boring. It's in these moments that you realize that she is like a volcano waiting to erupt. It's hard to watch because Erika Kohut is a horrible and evil woman who takes pleasure in being sexually embarrassed. She is a victim to her own self- masochism.",The Piano Teacher

The film itself won a few awards at this years Cannes film festival. Which makes it doubly surprising that the brilliant 'Amelia' wasn't even selected. Perhaps the two films represent the pola opposites of French film making? I'm sure that a film like this will have it's fans. And in many ways it is well made.

139,davidguy,A good start but a difficult end...,8,14 September 2001,"Overall I found this film good: exceptional acting with disturbing scenes (some essential, some useless) and weak second half. CONTAINS SPOILERS The film is divided in 2 parts. I thought the first half of the Pianist was terrific. We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world. She is single, struggling to find her space against an over-protective and borderline tyrannic mother. We understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical+emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releases her sexual tensions in sex-shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-mutilations ... This first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable.Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played superbly by Benoit Magimel). Though he gets to feel Erika's coldness in the beginning, he seduces her and slowly wreaks Erika's fortress. He loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires. Then when she is about to fall for him, he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that Erika is unable to love or feel at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching as we see Erika's inability/inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction. This second half seemed less mastered by Haneke, and sometimes had non-credible (ie. too shocking) scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama.Of course, this is a crude film at least in the French version: you see porn sequences from the sex shop, daring mutilation and sex scenes. The much talked-about fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was quite good I thought, and is central to understand Erika's sick relation to love. As to the actors, Huppert is marvelous all through the film, Magimel gets better and better up to perfection, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent.",The Piano Teacher

I was prepared to some sort of a strong film, perhaps like Dancing in the Dark, but got instead ridiculous nonsense that was crying for a few good parodies. It can only attract medical students who study psychiatry. I still believe that Isabelle Huppert is a fine actress, though.

Don't let a sundance award, 2-hour length, and the wacky dichotomy of high culture and sex fool you. I love Classical music but the dialogue about Schubert, Schoenberg and Bruckner sounded horribly pretentious.Many scenes are way too long. I'll give you an example. I love Kubrick films, but when they are slowly paced, it is to enforce a mood or to add some white space to a colorful tapestry. It's like the editor for this film was on sabbatical. It doesn't help that you have no desire to care about the characters either. How can I care about a ""protagonist"" who never smiles? At least bad guys in other movies get some joy out of being evil. This lady is just an irritating witch. I'll give the lady props for doing a fine job of acting, but that's as close as I can come to praise for this film.The events, violence, and sexual aspects aren't even weird or shocking. Lynch has got weird/shocking nailed. There's no reason to expect anything that ends up taking place.

It is disturbing, and intentionally so.  We squirm in our seats as we watch the bizarre sexual machinations of Erika, played with extraordinary virtuosity by Isabelle Huppert.  She is sadistic (psychologically and physically), masochistic (psychologically and physically), and emotionally dependent; she is also, quite frankly, a monster, but is made three dimensional and even somewhat sympathetic by Ms. Huppert's highly nuanced performance.This film is NOT for everyone, and people should be warned that there are several very graphic scenes involving sex, sexual violence and other things some will find legitimately offensive. None of this is gratuitous, however, or simply for titillation's sake as is often the case in Hollywood fare. The French once again demonstrate their cinematic maturity with realistic portrayals of romantic relationships, and their frequent use of ambiguous endings.The Piano Teacher is a well crafted portrait of deviance run amok, and something of a cautionary tale on the possible consequences of deviant sexual behavior.",The Piano Teacher
144,georgiain,Michael Haneke explores complex emotions with cold objectivity,9,10 December 2003,"Pianists in films are often subject to high emotions.  Shine and the The Piano also feature characters in some way damaged by the rigors and strong emotions of mastering such an instrument.Isabelle Huppert in the piano teacher is another damaged pianist to add to the list.  She misses an absent father and is stifled by a neurotic, claustrophobic love/hate relationship with her mother with whom she lives. More than that she is saturated with the strong emotions of the music she so painstakingly perfects.  With no emotional outlets she is driven to self harm, with no sexual outlets to voyeuristic acts that you feel she almost wants to be caught in.However Haneke doesn't try to make us pity her.  Rather this is a cold objective view, mirrored in the cool colours and highly constructed frames in which this film is shot.  She is both a victim and cruel in her own turn. Cold to her students and given to sadistic acts such as the mind games she plays on the pupil she spots looking at a porn magazine in a newsagents.Into this Benoit Magimel comes a wonder boy, infatuated with Huppert. Foppish good books and the mannerisms of a stage lover are jolted when Huppert sets out her S&M agenda.  The relationship becomes violent and damaging in unintended ways leading to the shocking climax.This is a terrifyingly believable (if extreme) view of a chain of damage that emotionally distressed individuals inflict on each other.  The film is all the more painful as there are no good or bad characters, simply characters who the more they want to be loved the more they are hurt and do harm.The perfect emotional pitch of the classical music they are producing only serves to highlight their emotional turmoils.  Striving for perfection is their downfall.",The Piano Teacher

I find this hard to comprehend given the outstanding performance by Isabelle Huppert. Huppert is gripping - she manages to convey perfectly the woman on the edge, full of self-hate and delusion.The film is wonderfully paced and judged. It would be so easy to portray the lead as a ridiculous figure - consider the scene in the porn store for instance. Somehow, Huppert is able to carry it off, partly because of her brilliant performance but also because the director makes her surreal life real and identifiable.Don't ignore this film. It is one of the most startling and engaging films (and performances) I have seen.Trust Boris!",The Piano Teacher
146,swaindominic,"A dark and disturbing, yet truly brilliant film experience.",9,16 June 2011,"I'm not sure I should really attempt a review of this because I doubt very much that I can sum it up or even begin to describe the power of this film. One thing to say is that it is extremely challenging viewing and if you are unsure of watching this make sure you know what you are in for first. Not that anything could prepare you for this film, but be aware that it is a dark and often disturbing look into some of the most troublesome aspects of human behaviour.I can't say that this is an enjoyable film - that surely isn't the right word. However, this is filmmaking at its very best, coupled with a central performance from Isabelle Huppert that genuinely deserves the high praise it has received. I was only introduced to Michael Haneke very recently, and this is only the 2nd of his films that I have seen, but he is clearly an incredibly gifted director and writer who makes films almost unlike any others I have seen.Films of sustained intensity and anxiety are quite rare, and there are very few films I have seen that are able to achieve the intense and foreboding atmosphere that Haneke, and also Isabelle Huppert, craft here. What is unique is that Haneke doesn't rely on a chilling musical score to build tension, nor is the film cast in dark and brooding light that suggests to us what the underlying nature of the story is. Haneke builds the tension with supreme subtlety and ingenious craft. The only music that is used comes from the piano playing of the characters themselves; the beautiful and artistic music is juxtaposed with the dark and secretive thoughts of Erika. We gradually delve into the troubled mind of the otherwise austere piano teacher, Erika, and get glimpses of a side of her which initially seems almost out of place. Her acts are played out to a backdrop of a sad and lonely existence, one in which she is still controlled by a domineering and rather embittered mother. The mother, played excellently by Annie Girardot, perhaps gives us a tiny insight into why Erika feels trapped and repressed.Huppert is astounding and the subtle nuances of her performance are indicative of an actress at the very top of her game. Huppert conveys so much fear, sadness, lust, anger and even love through a veneer of temperance. She constantly reminds us that these feelings are largely repressed and yet we can see them bubbling under the surface. Huppert betrays these underlying dark emotions often with as little as a slight shift in her facial expression – make no mistake this is acting of the highest calibre; subtle, understated and yet utterly powerful and compelling.The actions of Erika are often quite alarming and certainly not appealing, and yet it is the hallmark of excellence, in both Haneke's script and Huppert's performance, that we can still sympathise with this woman. Even, if it is only a fleeting glimpse of sympathy or understanding – it is still there. That is how I felt, and that is another reason why the film is so challenging. Should I feel sympathy? Should I feel anger? Should I feel disgust? Haneke doesn't insist that we feel one way or another, he lets the power of the story carry itself and the viewer is left to sift through this thickened sea of conflicting emotion.As I said at the start, I don't think I can do this film justice on paper – it has to be seen; and if you do choose to see it you will get something much more – you will feel your way through it. As I watched this film I felt an array of different emotions; I was gripped, tense, anxious, saddened, disgusted and much more. By the end I had a barrage of unanswered questions and I wasn't even sure how to feel about what I'd seen. That is the beauty, and I do mean beauty, of this incredibly thought-provoking and dark film. If after reading this you think you can stomach the content then I would encourage you to watch it for a very unique film experience. It is a breathtaking film but one that might well leave you with an uncomfortable feeling deep in the recesses of your subconscious. 9/10.",The Piano Teacher
147,Wallace_the_Windows,A Compassionate Film About Twisted People,9,18 January 2002,"To be honest I had to go have a stiff drink after this film; I felt drained and my shoulders were knotted. I also had to talk the whole thing out with the friend I saw it with for a good half hour. Whatever else this movie is, it's not dull - you have to have respect for anything that produces such a visceral reaction, even if you couldn't claim to have 'enjoyed' the experience. (Anyone else I've talked to who's seen it has responded in much the same way.)The reason the film is so powerful is not simply because it deals with unpalatable subject-matter like sado-masochism and violently dysfunctional relationships - that on its own would leave no defence against a charge of exploitation. It packs a punch because whatever her deeply ingrained character flaws, however reprehensible her behaviour (and at one point that's VERY), the piano teacher Erika always retains your sympathy - you never forget the type of influences which might have made her what she is, while scenes as subtle as the one where she walks down a street of shoppers, being casually bumped into without apology, remind you of her utter isolation. Isabelle Huppert's performance is as brilliant as it is uncomfortable and I can't even imagine how she might have wound down after a day's filming.Appalling, compelling, horribly funny at times, but ultimately deeply despairing look at how people damage each other. View with caution.",The Piano Teacher
148,GaryMotev,More brilliance from Haneke,10,19 June 2002,"The only director who really matters right now is Michael Haneke.  The 60-ish Austrian is only just now becoming known to American audiences (despite having been making films for a decade), because in this age of false freedom and faux radicalization, he's the real thing: a genuine free thinker and radical. This makes his work scarily demanding, but on top of that, it's also relentlessly un-sensational: while he works on only the most extreme ideas and projects, Haneke suppresses all superficial gratification.  Heads don't blow off, guns never fire, and nothing ever explodes - even though there's a high degree of emotional violence, the release mechanisms of cinema are completely suppressed.  Catharsis is to be excised, avoided, or parodied; Aristotle's polemics are treated as laughably passe; most of Haneke's work ends abruptly, intentionally doesn't resolve, or actually re-starts at square one.  As a result, his movies have been called ""torture mechanisms"", although his method is completely understandable: in a world of movies designed entirely as mindless catharsis, Haneke is staking out its antithesis as the province of his art: he's focusing on what everyone else has been avoiding. The results can be cruel but are always exhilarating.   Even I can't quite recommend ""Funny Games"", in which he turns the revenge cheapie (think ""Last House on the Left"") on the audience itself, forcing the viewer to suffer along with his victims.  With its suffocated family dog, obliterated little boy, and eventual meta-narrative, ""Funny Games"" is probably the most disturbing intellectual statement since ""A Clockwork Orange"". But while at first I felt that Haneke was Kubrick's heir, I'm becoming more and more aware of his debts to Kieslowski. In structural terms, Kubrick worked musically, and tried to impregnate the image itself with a novelistic depth. Haneke, on the other hand, avoids impressing us with his technique; instead he designs submerged structures and paradigms which illuminate but never directly state their themes.   There's never a memorable shot in Haneke, much less a clever camera angle, or ""dazzling"" sequence; he simply disdains all that; he doesn't ""love light"", or edit with ""a sense of rhythm""; somehow he just knows how to grip you without them.  In ""Code Unknown"" he actually parodies the tracking shot - sometimes the camera keeps going when the characters have stopped, sometimes vice versa.  In fact the one masterfully ""suspenseful"" sequence in the movie turns out to be a film WITHIN the film - Haneke just throws it in there to show that yes, he knows exactly how to do that, too. Which brings us to his latest, ""The Piano Teacher"", with Isabelle Huppert, the first of his films to achieve even an arthouse release in the U.S., and certainly the most interesting film so far this year.  Part of this new visibility, of course, is due to Huppert's presence, and part of it is due to the subject matter: everybody thinks they ""understand"" movies about frigid, bitchy women who are sexually perverted, and everyone expects them to be dirtily exciting beneath a patina of intellectual respect. In other words, they're dependable arthouse fodder, since that crowd loves nothing more than looking down its nose at other people's sexual mores. Of course, with Haneke, the arthouse is in for a surprise.  Rather like those who were shocked that ""Eyes Wide Shut"" did not give them an erection, some critics have had to turn away from scenes in which the main character nonchalantly sniffs semen-crusted tissues in a porno booth, or cuts her labia with a razor to ""simulate"" menstruation.  What's almost worse is that these events usually occur just out of our line of sight, turning us into failed voyeurs - the furtive sex all happens with the characters mostly clothed, although their note-perfect performances tell you exactly where they are in the course of each act.   This is de rigeur for Haneke, but it sends some folks into a  tizzy (Where's the sudden, split-second shot of the bloody wound to make me scream?   They can sense Haneke is messing with them, but unlike with, say, Tarentino, they can't figure out why.  There are no ironically-framed immature gratifications here; what's all this FOR? (They just can't figure out that they have to figure it out.) To be fair, there's a lot to figure out.   Most critics have grabbed onto the old ""repression"" handle to explain Huppert's character, Erika Kohut, a sadistic piano teacher at a top Viennese academy.  Erika lives alone with her aging mother (Annie Girardot)  in an abusive psychological ""marriage"" in which the two women even sleep in two beds pushed together.  So the ""repression"" handle seems good as far as it goes, but it doesn't really go very far - Mother's comment that ""we're a passionate family"" after Erika hits her full in the face is the first hint that repression ain't what this is all about. Erika's relationship with her mother may be the starting point for her emotional state, but she's hardly repressed: in fact, she's in full, chilly flower.  She has her own theory of Schubert (her specialty) - something about being poised at the brink of madness, and the composer's desolate ""Winterreise"" is practically her theme, with its creepy lyrics about hounds pulling at their chains.  Erika is fully conscious of her desires, and knows exactly what she wants - she just can't get it in the ""normal"" course of human events.  So she's reduced to various forms of voyeurism.  Perhaps the film's eeriest image is of her wandering among the cars at a drive-in movie (in Vienna?) like a lonely ghost; she's looking for a couple in coitus to watch and climax with (and eventually she finds one, with humiliating results). Clearly, she equates romantic ecstasy with cruelty (which is not the same thing as repression) - and music itself, which operates in the film as a metaphor for love, has become a theater of sadism for her.  She berates and humiliates her students, even mutilating the hands of one (this scene, in which Erika places broken glass in the girl's pockets, is one of the most chilling evocations of malice aforethought in all film). Into this frozen maelstrom wanders Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a young pianist who's handsome, talented, sweet, and conceited.  Klemmer is intrigued, then obsessed by Erika's icy disdain for his charms - which we can tell have always gotten him exactly what he wanted.  Using his frustration as leverage, Erika slowly ropes him into becoming her partner in her own version of ""love"".  This involves, of course, sadomasochism and degradation - only it's to be performed per her instructions exactly (and they run to several pages, single-spaced), in a way which will take vengeance on (of course) her mother. Klemmer declares Erika ""sick"" - he's used to the usual give-and-take of standard sex, and he certainly doesn't hate women.  But as he appreciates that domination of Erika physically actually means submission to her WILL, he reacts in a way that is subtly horrifying.  Here Haneke plays his hidden trump card, for in Klemmer's ""forcing"" of normal lovemaking on Erika, we perceive that he is actually committing rape.  In a word, he ""breaks"" her, and we can tell that she'll never recover.  Her last horrifying gesture (and Huppert is unforgettable) somehow combines rejection with a kind of animal-like defiance. As usual, Haneke has sprung a kind of trap, and turned the tables on the audience.  How are we to dismiss Erika, when her perversities - all mirror images of idealized love - have produced such a cruel reaction in her sunny love-god - and in us?  We're left floating in a kind of moral netherworld, like the singer of ""Winterreise"", in which we appreciate that our erotic pleasures have always had their dark twin of erotic disgust.  And how are to say that this dark twin can't produce the same kind of transcendence?  We deny it with no authority, as we - with Klemmer - are provoked to actual domination of Erika, just as she wished, but this time in OUR control, not hers.  We want to hurt her - but why? ""The Piano Teacher"", of course, is therefore concerned with the most basic issues of humanism - but it's an inquiry, not a treatise (this is where Haneke differs from his character, although they certainly share something in common).  Unlike what all the pop critics label ""subversive"", this movie is ACTUALLY subversive - it gets under your assumptions and stays there. And for this, of course, it will probably be limited to a short run on the East and West coasts.  But watch for it on video.",The Piano Teacher

If you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you. A large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness. I did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little distasteful and pointless. The only reason I did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot. The plot, however, has little to recommend. A large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano, which might appeal to some people.

During the whole time I watched this movie I felt a knot in my stomach and I could not tell was it because I was repulsed by the peculiarity of the movie or by its inherent familiarity to our every day lives The music in the film was absolutely beautiful and I found myself looking forward to the performances because that was the only time I felt like I was returning to the comforts of ""normal"" every day existence and escaping the absurdity of the sexual side of Erica's life... Even though as represented in this movie the ""normal"" musical life is a prison from which one needs to escape...

153,louiebotha,The Piano teacher. Being on the verge of madness,8,14 December 2007,"The first time I saw a Michael Haneke movie I had to compel myself thru it. It was the seventh continent. But still, the movie was on my 'to get' list for a long time after that. I had difficulty getting my hands on an affordable copy. Why was it so grueling to watch? The qualities that made so many flock to movies - ""human warmth"", excitement, people shedding tears, bloodshed on an epic scale; these are omitted in the Haneke movies I've watched. The characters are not likable. They might be crying. They could be having sex as well. But it is like suddenly having insight in General Walther Model's emotional life. It feels alien. In The Piano Teacher, one is looking for what feels like minutes at merely a door closing, waiting for someone to emerge from it. It is almost like waiting for a reward, for watching this. Haneke, I read, is a courageous man. He does not compromise. He does not pretend. His movies are realistic. And slow moving. Time moves here like a glacier. His movies are like cold breezes from the poles. It must have been the lingering and haunting memory of the seventh continent that made me rent The Piano Teacher, because I've watched ""Time of the Wolf"" a while ago and found it a boring movie. The Piano Teacher is an incredibly rewarding movie. It's about a piano teacher, Erika Kohut, in Vienna. She is staying with her mother in a small apartment; in fact, they share a bed. Their relationship is strange; her mother is incredibly possessive, almost jealous. For instance, they get into a fight about Erika buying an expensive dress; it ridiculously gets out of hand (pulling out hair, slapping, etc). Then they made up with the mother remarking, ""We are a hot blooded-family, this is the way it is"". Erika is overall unable to express her emotion. Apparently, that is typical Austrian. Then, a student (Walter Klemmer) starts to pursue her and applies to enter her class, after being blown away by a conversation between them about Schumann's madness; His so called twilight right before he went mad, when he realizes he will soon ""loose himself"" completely. She senses that he has a hidden agenda and tries to shun him from entering her class by stating, ""I feel unable to nurture Mr. Klemmer's virtuosity"". He enrolls in her classes, but it become soon really obvious that he is unable to think about anything else than her. Eventually they get involved. This is where the movie gets really shocking. A better word is probably anti social. Ridiculous. I'm only going to comment here that Erika wants to run a pretty tight ship on sexual matters. She will state what when, where and how. It is quite obvious that she is a very repressed woman. Between classes also, she frequents sex shops. Or walks around in a road movie theater, engaging in an act of flagrant voyeurism when encountering a couple making love in their car. Simultaneously, she verbally attacks and manipulates one of her students when she caught him in the sex shop. I've asked myself initially why the scene (Erika damaging one of her insecure students hands by secretly slipping broken glass pieces into her pocket) is in the film, to realize later on that Haneke deliberately try to make Erika not likable. Even Walter gets a bit disgusted at a point when she insist on him tying her up, hitting her, etc. She replies later on that this has always been inside her, the urge to be hit. It seems as if Erika's governing dynamic is extremity; she is fluctuating only between scream and whisper (a quote from the movie about playing Schubert). She appears to be on the twilight of her sanity, like her idol Schumann. When she eventually fell in love with Walter, it is then also the only way forward - to fracturing her mind. It is inevitable because she is completely unable to cope with her own emotion. She gets even more radical: The letter she writes him, cannot be explained in sane terms. Walter's defense when he eventually ends up raping her is that ""you cannot delve in people's inside and then reject them"" but there was not much that could prepare him for Erika's twisted up inside. Erika's defense is basically, ""Love is built on banal things"".In another director's hands, the film matter at hand could easily have turned this movie into a 'likeable' film, with agreeable characters. It is possible to alienate modern man from emotions, and to make the filmgoers identify with his struggle. It would have been possible to make society 'feels her pain'. But this movie is stripped. It does not want to be liked. It is strong, and clear. The long shots on Erika's face, clarify a lot. It is a clear shot of apocalypse.",The Piano Teacher

158,mats_big_thingy,Self-denial as a feminine law of orgasm,10,9 February 2007,"Self-denial as a feminine law of orgasm. What does this mean in La Pianiste: the spectator is given a crash course in Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis in 131 minutes, averting our concept of Erika from simply sexually cold, or merely fetishistic, to her as active sexed subject. This specifically feminine notion of what is sexual has been termed jouissance by Jacques Lacan - the term is to be contrasted with plasir (pleasure) but rather evokes the subject as proprietor of enjoyment, also attaining the pun jouir (in French to come or orgasm).Erika's task then is to achieve jouissance by means that do not represent in any way the power and signifier of the Father (who is present in his absence - consider the scenes of Erika's aggression towards her Mother). She has to commit herself to self-denial in the form of what Freud called the Death Drive. This often misused and misunderstood term is justified in Lacan's Freudianism as the rejection of the symbolic realm - this meaning the striving for a self that is not in the Paternal world of discourse. In this specific sense Erika rejects penetrative sexual intercourse and embarks in various other forms of enjoyment out of the typical penis centred sexual arrangement.La Pianiste is an example of a theoretically aware film and seems to write its own symptomatic readings for us, which in this way is very significant to academic endeavours in film, though most importantly for the perversity in the cinematic experience, which of late has been somewhat lacking in substance.",The Piano Teacher
159,allenap,Rich and dark,10,31 October 2007,"This film concerns a piano teacher, Erika, her troubled sexual and emotional life, her relationship with her mother and the possibility of a sexual relationship with a student.Erika's untypical behaviour has been attributed to a number of factors-her mother, her demanding profession, Austrian society, Western gender sex roles etc. This film bears repeated viewings as there are clearly complex interactions between all these factors within Erika's psyche.Some scenes are disturbing, yes, but as well as being upsetting for sensitive viewers, these scenes are highly memorable! Haneke is excellent at creating moments which deliver a sort of sustained jump-shock: the self-harm scene in which Erika is sitting at the edge of the bath-tub is perhaps the best example. Few people seem to acknowledge that the film can be quite funny. In contrast to the horror and discomfort of scenes depicting Erika's ""perversions"", the stuffiness of her behaviour in a professional context is highly amusing: when a student gives a performance lacking in nuance, Erika describes the girl's playing as being laden with ""middle-class complacency"" or some such nonsense.In contrast to the minimalism of ""Hidden"", Haneke allows for considerably more incident in this film (although the movie does take its time when a scene demands it). I think this an admirable compromise with the very dense writing of Elfriede Jelinek. In case I haven't made this clear: ""The Piano Teacher"" is a superb film.",The Piano Teacher

While all her students admire her for her incredible talent and experience, they all fear her due to the emotionless harsh critics she launches. Her relationship with her mother is a true havoc, when both of them love but distrust each other. Having to take so much stress and repression, Erika finds relief on hurtful sexual experiences. That was it, until a young man, fascinated by her, comes into her life and insists to get to her. This shakes Erika, and therefore, makes her have to step out of her dreadful, but safe routine.This movie is just perfect.

I don't know.  My reason for writing this is to provide a counterpoint to the majority of opinions expressed here.I like dark and disturbing films.  I like subversive irreverence and I like art that exposes the sick pathology that lies underneath much of what passes for ""normalcy.""  Haneke is obviously a unique and powerful director, but I have to label much of what he provides here as gratuitous-- a term I honestly hate to use because its' common usage serves to dismiss anything that's vibrant and gloriously profane.  I was really enjoying this film at first.  Huppert plays the role so well and it was very convincing as she portrayed the uptight bitch with a twisted sexuality.  First she's sniffing cum towels in a porno booth.  Then she's spying on a couple copulating. Excellent.  Now she's cutting her labia with a razor blade.  OK, this is good.  People need to see this.  OK, now she's molesting her own mother in bed.  What?  Wait a second... she's molesting her own mother?  Yes.  It was very shocking, but that's not what I disliked about it.  At this point in the film, she ceases to be just a perverted victim of an oppressive mother. Now she's legitmately crazy by virtually anyones' standards.  At this point, she (and therefore the film) is no longer interesting.  A little later in the film she's asking to be tied up, beaten and humiliated by her ""lover."" It's as if Haneke is equating S & M sex with insanity.  Hmm, that's not a very forward thinking attitude.  That's a puritanical one!I applaud Haneke for challenging audience expectations; pushing the boundaries of cinema; inspiring debate, etc etc...

169,dbainy-534-263253,Love without compromise,10,20 November 2012,"SynopsisThe story is about Erica, a professional pianist/teacher at the esteemed Vienna Conservatory of music in the modern day. The severity she applies herself to her professional life is evident in the expectations of herself and that of her students. The contextual existence impacts her as a woman. Between caring for a domineering mother and her busy schedule as a professor of music and occasional recital pianist, she is without a lover or husband. Her sense of perfectionism is shaped by her discipline needed to be at the top of her professional life. However gifted and normal Erica appears during the day, at night she is perverse and bent in her views towards sexuality. She indulges herself frequently with peep shows, mutilates herself during masturbation, with voyeuristic and s&m sexual tendencies. One day at a recital at a wealthy benefactor's home, she meets the talented young handsome pianist Walter. Walter, an engineer student, exudes confidence and talent while performing a piece of music that Erica loves and sought to perfect in her career that of Robert Schumann of the 19th century's Romantic period. Walter woos her with his natural charisma and his forwardness despite being her pupil and her icy resistance. Upon consummation, he discovers her sexual perversion. The couple hits a detour. She forces him to comply her ways without compromise. Despite Walter's disgust and hesitation, he eventually gives into her perversion because of his love for her. However, like a classic tragedy, Walter overcomes her powers and leaves her.AnalysisAs part of the special feature, Isabelle Huppert discusses the central themes of the film she tried to illustrate. She had envisioned a woman enraptured by her own ambitions and idealism of love. She wants a perfect lover. A lover that is completely under her power yet be strong and independent. Isabelle spoke of fragility of being a woman, that somehow she needs to exhibit almost masculine like facade to control and keep things orderly. The demands of her professional life and domestic life has repressed the character to the point she wasn't able to develop emotional skills needed to nurture a loving healthy relationship. When the character Erica meets Walter, Huppert explained she wanted to portray a woman who did not want to be seduced. She felt seduction gives power to the man. A woman becomes weak when she is in love. Huppert wants to portray Erica wanting to maintain her power and absolute control. Erica follows her premeditation by not satisfying Walter at their first sexual encounter. Her behaviour towards him in their relationship is hateful, sadistic, cold and false. Yet in a way she wanted a warm gentle person to love her unconditionally that of a perfect lover who should please her in her perverse s&m sexual ways. Her inability to compromise led Walter to become increasingly frustrated and eventually fall out of love. My TakeThe film is a heavy weight. As it gets to the core of the matter why relationships fail. For me this film uses Erica's extreme sexual perversion to illustrate and expedite how people are sometimes fixated on their own goals that blind sight them from more important aspects of keeping or fostering a relationship. What could have be an ideal pairing of two compassionate and like minded people, in the case of Walter and Erica, is broken by the pair's inability to reconcile their differences. The fundamental cause of failure in any relationships is when one person places one's ego, freedom, and ideals without compromise over the relationship. It's the all or nothing attitude that breaks.",The Piano Teacher
170,campnicole,Painful and demands almost too much from the viewer (potential spoiler),3,13 November 2005,"Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it's intrigue, I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers. Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained ""your father died today"" comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters.This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering. Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film. I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether.This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it's over. I LOVED movies such as ""Trainspotting"" or ""Requiem for a Dream"" - which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing.

I think that Erika is suffering from similar mental illness(es) as pertains to her father (whom we find out went insane, then later that he dies during the course of the film in the asylum). FURTHERMORE, I believe that her ""enslavement"" to her mother MUST come from more than just some kind of long-term build-up of stronger and stronger emotions and mental illness re: sexuality and power struggles. I.e., I believe she was probably sexually abused and/or molested by the mother, and perhaps by the father, as well. Re: the scene where Walter rejects her after she gives him her letter spelling out how their relationship is to work and what she desires, she lays beside her mother in bed before leaping on her mother, screaming that she loves her and attempting to engage her mom in sex. I believe that a past such as this (or something within the same kind of traumatic experiences) provides explanation and motive for her actions and state of mind/being. Re: the end... I don't believe she dies. Like many great French films that leave you without a nice, clean ending =) in my opinion, what is likely is that she will wind up following the same fate as her father... she has a knife wound, but considering WHERE she stabbed herself AND the fact that the sheer force required to make that kind of wound LIFE-threatening is not something she did when she carried out the act, I concluded that she she would wander the street bleeding until someone would simply notice her condition, ask her if she needed help, etc. etc. until she was taken to a hospital or into police custody (and THEN to a hospital) after which she would be committed to a psychiatric facility where she would spend the rest of her life.",The Piano Teacher

I hardly could speak. I was shocked in a positive also a negative way. And all I felt was to go to the cinema again on the other day and watch something very stupid, funny stuff to oust this inexplicable feeling from me. Very impressive, gripping drama about a middle-aged daughter (Erika) who cannot get rid of her mother's selfish, sick love. This relationship is not a love more like an obsession. Affectionate and loathsome attachment. Erika is a snobbish, sadistic piano teacher who enjoys humiliating her pupils. On a private concert she meets Walter, a young, talented pianist. Walter falls for Erika but she has her own rules in ""love"" which makes him abhor, confused and disappointed. She stretches the border-lines in this relationship till it is too late. Isabelle Huppert as Erika is cold, piteous, but still makes you want to slap her for her snobbish, sadistic behavior. Brilliant as always, supposedly this cold, sexually deviant, aristocratic part suits her the most. Benoit Magimel as Walter is poignantly handsome, exalted, vibrating but a bit light-minded talent. Also superb. I might not recommend this movie to everyone but those people who really like to be shocked, who like art movies flavored with deviance, and who love living in the atmosphere of a movie for hours or days.

Sure, I would want to be loved, but who could resist... such a seduction? By such a handsome, confident, and a little rough-- young man? There are three critical scenes where the power play between Erika and Walter goes back and forth. They are each very seductive and sensual in its own right. The first, when Walter goes to the bathroom and kisses Erika, is really a scene of such tension and anticipation-- the freshness of the first kiss, the urge to feel one another and the sense of -- fearful self-restraint, it's all overwhelming. It is one where Erika dominates, and succeeds. The second scene-- when Erika goes to see Walter in the ice skating link, is stunningly beautiful. I think this is the most satisfying one out of the three; despite the pitiful state in which Erika walks out... she is so vulnerable, walking while almost falling in her high heels on ice... but she is able to conquer Walter in some way. They share their expressions of love, he makes love to her and even though she vomits there is a strange tie between vomit and purity-- she feels pure inside because now he is with her... and he is part of what she always wanted, for him to tell her that she's his little love but command her as he wishes. Power is somehow shared between the two. It seems as if they are on a equal footing; Erika has conquered Walter and he has conquered her. There is a sense of misery as well as victory. The third scene, when Walter comes to Erika's house and he hits her and rapes her, is such an ironic, but very erotic in a violent way. Walter is finally unable to control himself-- he finds himself tormented by ardent desires for Erika. He hits her on the face and tells her, isn't this what she wanted? Erika says no, but somewhere in my mind I kept saying yes... she did want it, she wanted pain and feverish desire-- and in a way she gains it. The rape scene is full of tension and pitiful tag-of-war of control and passion, as Walter kissed Erika's mouth full of blood and comes inside her, who is motionless. The power has shifted to Walter. He now physically controls her, dominates her. Erika had asked for it-- but, he never really is able to conquer her emotionally, which leaves a sense of futility and dissatisfaction. From a different perspective, Erika has succeeded in controlling Walter-in figurative sense. When he says that he has been masturbating under her window, that is the clearest statement that Erika really has taken over, she has control of Walter's mind. He cannot resist thinking about her, he cannot leave her alone and he feels the urge to have her, he must possess her. During the rape scene, I couldn't help but ask myself, why is she not responding to this? Why is she acting like a corpse? Because in a way this is really what Erika wanted. After watching the interview of Isabelle Huppert it made a little more sense, but I still couldn't entirely agree. She says that Erika wanted to be loved and not seduced; and she realizes that she would never be really loved. There is a schism between her fantasy and reality. Perhaps. But all that is full of contradiction, Walter denies several times that he loves her, but at other times he swears that he does. In passion there is an element of love, and one can never entirely separate the two. In violence there is a sense of joy, there is pleasure. Reality and fantasy mix. So to me the movie is not only about a failed fantasy. It is more about a fantasy that crystallized, although in a chaotic, disorganized form. In her silence there is a defiance, in his act there is a sense of desperation. In her death there is a sense of emptiness, but also victory; in her taking control of her own life it ensures revenge to the young man who thought he had won. It isn't a true defeat, although it leaves a sense of sadness. At the end she still controls herself and his mind. Walter's obsession for Erika, undoubtedly, would continue to expand because of it.It's a movie that won't let go, just as Erika's presence would never let go of Walter. I believe that she would stay with him forever, like a fever inside his mind-- even if he might pretend otherwise.",The Piano Teacher
174,gromeks-1,you guys make me laugh,1,23 February 2006,"I love the way EVERY single review about this movie asserts that it has been misunderstood, that it is really obvious and pure genius but nobody noticed, etc. I love the way that everyone agrees on the fact that a movie has been ""soooo misunderstood"".There is nothing worse than an American taking for granted that a movie is pure genius just because it is European (""where culture comes from, man""). It seems that these people feel obliged to love an Austrian movie so that they can show off in their entourage because they are the only ones actually knowing where Austria is.I have just seen a opera in Paris directed by Haneke. Can you imagine Don Giovanni as ugly, dirty, perverse as Huppert in the pianist ? Well I say that Mozart's opera was spoiled. Haneke has an obvious problem, that is nor genius nor insanity. It is just lack of creativity. Everything he does is so purely literal, without an ounce of thought given to it, just raw. And the beauty of it is that he convinces some people that he is a genius. But the aforementioned people are not the sharpest tool in the box, far from it. They just tend to be snobs.Laughable.",The Piano Teacher
175,Royce Vavrek,Amazing!,10,24 October 2001,"This film is utterly amazing.  From the performances of Huppert, Girardot, and Magimel, to Haneke's screenplay and direction there is not a single misstep.  The film may put some people off with it's hard sexual subject matter and with it's slower pace, but it really is a masterful piece of cinema... so do not let it's challenging ways keep you away!Powerful, and deserving every award it won in Cannes!",The Piano Teacher
176,sparkacus,Not a date flick.,1,25 June 2006,"La Pianiste seems just a bit too blunt and casual about the depraved aspects of both main characters. It definitely does not fall into the trap of showing too much music and too little plot, but it seems to give short shrift to the artistic and musical themes. Likewise, the piano teacher's relationship with her mother seems to be little more than an idle cliché, with no development, back story, or ideation. With the piano teacher's sexual proclivities, the details are on parade, but without any illumination. The same seems to hold true for the reactions of her student. Nothing links his initial, quotidian responses to her weirdness with the escalating strangeness and violence in the latter parts of the film. As a whole, the film seems simply pornographic: one is presented with a mass of strange personality traits laid out in explicit detail, but that's it. Other French films have treated disturbing subjects--even more upsetting ones like pedophilia and infanticide--with a lot more sensitivity and less callow detachment. This one just seems to lack a soul. And what is up with that scene with the razor blade in the bathroom?",The Piano Teacher

179,bendeguzb,Not for christmas time,1,10 December 2020,This movie could be good becasue its theach us and show something hidden. BUT it connects a horrfying feeling with making love behind the story. The motivation of the director is exaggerated.,The Piano Teacher
180,daves_mates,Disturbing,9,16 December 2001,"Isabelle Huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is staid, unfriendly and distant in public, and bitter towards her students. Privately, she seethes with violence and frustration, and her sexual life is solitary and perverse.  She lives with her overbearing mother, who obsessively drives her to become noticed (and so advance in life) as a talented pianist.  The key to the characters of both mother and daughter is 'obsession.'  These characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death.The piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her.  They start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her, which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun.The film ties itself to the female lead.  Isabelle Huppert amazes with a brutal, completely convincing performance as the piano teacher.   She cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses.  As a film that is so character driven, you know it would not work half as well, had she acted poorly.
This is powerful, intelligently acted, and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel.  The camera work also suits the film.  There are what I can only think to call, framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about.  This is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is a further testament to the director's mastery.Expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film.  But, be brave - have the guts to go and see it.  This is a very private look into essentially one person's life, but do not expect to be entertained in the Hollywood sense....there are no car chases in this film!",The Piano Teacher

Dear David (from Beligium), why did you bother to write a comment on this movie? I only think we can think about you (after reading you comment), is that you're provably a non-sexual person (like Erika in the movie), and you are not ready for the new cinema that is coming up. I guess you are a bit old, and sexual expression is not part of your ""visage"". The Cannes Film Festival is by far the best movie festival, and I'm is my pleasure to say, that this film was awarded with: Best Actress, Best Actor and Grand Prix. Isabelle Huppert is magnificent, as always, who would do this movie like her? One of her best performances ever. The music is fantastic, and once more Michael Haneke puts reality in the big screen. It's like a Dogma95 kind of movie, because of the topic. Try to see it.",The Piano Teacher
182,oddog,perversion made boring,3,14 July 2002,"This movie purports to be a character study of perversion.  Some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted, the film is psychologically deep; actually, considering the salacious material, it is surprisingly tedious and shallow, with no motivational substance.  Why is the main character the way she is? You won't find out from the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.",The Piano Teacher

The characters(the female-lead and male-lead) in the film were very sharp and critical. The piano teacher(Erika) always retains your sympathy--she is self-mutilated and don't know how to love properly, and even herself. The film is very clinical but with an incredible tension that may arouse your tense feelings in different moments.It is a great film but is not a mainstream of course. I would suggest that you should get your emotion prepared before seeing the film. If you are studying or interested in psychology,you must go to see the film. The screenplay is a live study-case!",The Piano Teacher
185,Jaarfo,Still pathologizing domination-submission relations,3,13 October 2007,"I do not fail to recognize Haneke's above-average film-making skills. For example, I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, regarding the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). I mean D/s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something ""freakish"" or pathological; it isn't. In general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.So, for me, I feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film, worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?), and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in D/s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this).",The Piano Teacher

This story sucks, that was very unfortunate that I watch it. When you thought you will have an ending ... there is none. The story hanging there with only a view of a front door of a concert hall.Spare your money, do not even attempt to rent this movie. When you think there is arts in this movie, it bulls***. Its only a story of a brilliant piano female professor who's gone mad with sex. When you thought there is going to be a great sex scene.. THERE IS NONE.

187,kadatada,alternative sex,10,12 January 2005,"Well, this is my first comment on IMDb ever...i only hope it will be readable. On this occasion I would like to apologize for my not so good English, but what can you do. Two days ago I watched La pianiste on TV and I didn't watch it from the start, so I missed half on hour Ode the film. I put the volume on the minimum so my folks wouldn't here the noises of sex and I watched the TV from very small distance. Oh may, it was one of the best movies I've seen ever. The plot keeps you awake, and your sleepy eyes (if you've got one at the moment) become wide open expecting what kind of a sick and shocking think will happen next. The actors, are absolutely great especially Isabelle Huppert. If some is turned on older girls, this is a right film for him. The end left me drifting, trying to figure out what has really happened...that kind of an end is my favorite. I one word, I would recommend everyone over 18 years old to see this alternative sex based movie.",The Piano Teacher
188,mylexicon,Decent effort,6,29 June 2013,"Whether or not you watch The Piano Teacher is down to your comfort zone and patience level. The sexual themes are closer to X-rated than R-rated, and the graphic imagery in the unrated cut is definitely worthy of an X-rating. If you are comfortable with X-rated themes and imagery, an additional hurdle still remains. The first hour of the film is inefficient (shall we say) character development. The relationship between mother and daughter unfold slowly. The relationship between the main character and her love interest develop slowly. The somewhat depraved manifestations of the main character's masochistic (and passive-aggressive sadism) are revealed quite slowly. To be sure, the main character's maladjusted behavior is critical to character development, but the vignettes of her behaviors are separated by repetitive relationship scenes that add little depth to the plot. Furthermore, the main character's sexual fantasies, which are revealed in the second half of the movie, and her lover's reaction do not require extensive character development to be believable.Overall the script writer and director skillfully create scenes that elicit emotional responses from the viewer, and those responses tell the viewer something about himself/herself. In that way, The Piano Teacher is a worthwhile European romance/relationship film, which ventures into territory untouched by most US directors and production companies. But efficient character development and cohesive plot structure would have improved the film substantially.",The Piano Teacher

190,corne-g,Intensely disturbed movie,1,28 February 2014,"This movie is an evil vortex sucking everything positive out of life as we know it. It leaves you feeling offended, disturbed and utterly disappointed. I was appalled at how many awards it has actually won. It directly indicates that critics and the public accept and applaud child abuse, sadomasochism, incest, the bludgeoning of women and then raping them, jealousy turning into assault, pornography, slavery & elitism. The slogan of this movie should be: ""Love = Rape"". The marketing department fell off the bus when they took the motto ""Sex Sells"" and turned it into ""Rape Sells"". Don't allow this movie to severely distort your view of what love should be between a man and a woman. How can one trust critics and their ratings on any other movie if filth like this is praised so much!? Real life is already teeming with so much evil, stealing our joy. Upon watching this drivel you are giving evil permission to once again, pilfer what little joy you have left, and slapping you in the face with it.

It begins with a look at the life of Erika Kohut, a respected music professor, who lives with her controlling mother. She is pursued by another talented young man named Walter Klemmer, and they soon enter into a Dominant/Submissive relationship. Erika is very sexually repressed and unhappy, mainly thanks to her mother, who keeps check on her like one would on a baby.In many ways this movie reminds me of The Black Swan.Her relationship with Walter, who is not so normal himself, soon deteriorates and and the movie ends with Erika cutting herself, probably with more self harm to come.

I've never seen a scene acted out so touching as that one, it remained in my mind for days.The darkness that Haneke explores in his movies is one that most of us keep away at a save distance. Not that we all need to be as twisted as Hanakes characters, but somehow you can relate to them and that is the shocking part. Especially in La Pianiste you can feel the social isolation that Hupert created for herself. The ugliness that drips from the outer facade. You also know that she's helpless the moment she opened up to Magimel (Klemmer) and from that moment on is nothing more than a fragile puppet.Both on the story that is being told, and the contemporary social issues that are involved: Just watch this one, if you dare.",The Piano Teacher

Even though the subject of sexual frustration, obsession and pain turning into pleasure is not your daily encountering, this movie played it of as normal as can be which makes this a stunning piece of art. Haneke has the power of letting every viewer walk away after the movie with all different kind of feelings and for me that's a very powerful trait in the world of movie-making. He gives us the task of being more alert or things will go unseen. The stabbing-scene came and ended in a blink of an eye and the expression of Hupert in that very moment left me stunned and breathless.

194,cobb-57705,SUBTLY DYNAMIC,7,3 April 2018,"The Piano Teacher is a film that can be best described as, with approval of the film's director Michael Haneke, ""obscene"". It's ""obscene"" in many aspects from the pervert and masochistic sexual nature of the story to the technicals that surround the picture. Of course, the mere premise, a piano teacher, who is sexually repressed by her overbearing mother, resorting to many sexually deviant fetishes is ""obscene"" enough, but it goes into a much deeper level as the story progresses. The film is presented in many long takes. They are punctuated through and through by hard cuts and a soundtrack of Schubert pieces that is diegetic and miniscule. It's ""obscene"" through how simple and naked the technicals are compared to many Hollywood films and blockbusters. These ""obscenities"" will turn off viewers who are opposed to the film's content and structure. But nevertheless, The Piano Teacher is clearly a well-made film with a clear vision from Michael Haneke. The acting is great, especially the teacher and the mother and the new student as they pull her back and forth. The long takes are deep and beautiful, with excellent detail to the subtle actions of the film. And the soundtrack, while being limiting, breathes air into film whenever it appears. With the film being in French, it can be a bit tedious at points to follow along with the subtitles and the subtle imagery, but all-in-all, it should be easy to comprehend. Whether you should see The Piano Teacher or not depends upon you taste. If you don't mind, it's a good film to take in and enjoy. 7/10 (Really, it's a 7.5)",The Piano Teacher
195,royba,A nauseating film.,1,20 March 2006,"A Really Mixed Up Movie. Mixed up? Yes. It contains a lot of classical piano playing and a great deal of sexual deviation. If you like classical piano you will hate the deviant sex. If you enjoy deviant sex the piano playing will bore you.The heroine is an unmarried professor in a music academy, and she lives with her old shrewish mother. She is harshly and destructively critical of her pupils to the point of sadism. But she has secrets. She likes to go to sleazy sex-shops and watch porn in the cabins. While there, she picks up discarded semen soaked waste and holds it to her nose. Later, just before the evening meal she takes a razor blade to her vulva and cuts it (Don't ask me why. Most cutters restrict themselves to their arms and legs). There is much blood, but she seems to get no pain from the operation, or enjoyment come to that. The scene gets close to farce. She is called to dinner during the operation, and one can imagine her calling out, ""I'll be there in a minute mother. I am just cutting my labia."" A talented boy is given to her as a scholarship pupil. Initially she is bitterly against him because he is an engineering student and she refuses to believe that an engineer can have musical talent.She has a mousy but talented female student. She puts broken glass into the girl's coat pocket which cuts her hand badly (Don't ask me why she does this).The boy falls in love with her and follows her into a public toilet where he attempts to kiss her. She resists this but unfastens his trousers and fondles his penis. He is aroused (not surprisingly) and wants to make love to her (not surprisingly). She rebuffs him and tells him she will leave if he touches her and orders him to stand still. But meantime she continues her intimate fondling and then commits fellatio.. She vomits when he ejaculates into her mouth.He continues to pursue her in spite of her vitriolic criticism of his piano playing, and he declares his love for her and makes it clear that he wants to make love to her. She again rebuffs him but tells him she will explain in writing what she wants and he must read the letter first. They meet in her house, locking themselves in her bedroom. Mother is disturbed but is helpless to interfere. He tries to make love to her but she insists that he read the letter. It says she has always had a desire to be bound and gagged, and be beaten. She produces the ropes and gag that she has acquired.The boy, who is sexually normal, is shocked and revolted.Need I go on much more? The film ends with her stabbing herself with a kitchen knife just before she is due to give and important concert.Well I suppose all good things have to come to an end. Pity the final stabbing did little but draw blood.All in all, this is a nauseating film and worth avoiding. I have been told that Elfriede Jellinek's novel ""La Pianiste"" (on which the film was based) is twice as ""repulsive,"" ""disgusting,"" and ""deranged."" But perhaps this is why the author eventually won a Nobel prize?",The Piano Teacher
