0,SnoopyStyle,Farts! Farts! Farts!,6,30 March 2018,"Hank Thompson (Paul Dano) is a castaway on a deserted island. He's preparing to hang himself when a body (Daniel Radcliffe) washes ashore. Using body gases, he rides the body like a jet ski back to the mainland. He starts talking to the body giving it the name Manny and teaching it rudimentary skills. Manny produces magical miracles to help him survive.Farts! Farts! Farts! I'm not offended but after some slightly amusing starting wackiness, the weirdness starts to bore me. None of it actually funny and it becomes more repetitive as it goes along. It's definitely unlike most other movies and I give it points for being different. It's great to see something unusual but otherwise, I would suggest skipping this.",Swiss Army Man
1,Horst_In_Translation,An abomination that fails with all its ambition,2,18 October 2016,"""Swiss Army Man"" is a 95-minute full feature film from this year (2016) and it is the first long movie by writers and directors Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan. It is basically a two-man show starring Paul Dano (""There Will Be Blood"") and Daniel Radcliffe (""Harry Potter""). The former is stranded on an island and the latter plays a corpse who becomes best friends with Dano's character. But it is never clear at all what is going on inside this film. Is it all a delusion from Dano's character? It seems likely as we see not only him interacting with a corpse, but the corpse even moves and replies back to him. Sounds to me as if Dano's character completely lost his mind on the island and we see the direct effects and consequences. So from that perspective (and from others too), it is actually a somewhat realistic film, but all the filmmakers' ambition when it comes to authenticity is lost quickly because of the way they try to make it entertaining and funny. The jokes are about farting (it is not funny for over 20 minutes the same again and again, even if it may be true biologically), about thinking of your mate's mother when masturbating, about boners and about vomiting into each other's faces and drinking the puke afterward. So yeah, the comedy approach here is high school humor of the worst kind.And the film also comes short in terms of the dramatic impact it is trying to make. This becomes especially painful to watch when the film is trying to make a difference and teach a lesson when it comes to romance as it ends up drawing the conclusion that if you want romance, then do not fart loudly in public. Yes, it is a very strange movie. If there is anything good about the film, then that it is certainly different and you may never have seen something like it before. But it is as different as it is bad. The two lead actors are fairly solid, but they are also suffering from the script here and it makes them look ridiculous, especially in those scenes in which Dano is playing a girl all of a sudden. It is very easy to recognize that Kwan and Scheinert wanted to launch their full feature film career with a blast here, but their take on storytelling and creative freedom went wrong from start to finish here. This film has nothing on ""Cast Away"" or ""All Is Lost"". Instead, you can maybe call this film the little retarded (yes I say that word, no pun intended!) brother of the ones I just mentioned. And finally, a word on the ending. It was supposed to be uplifting and full of free spirit, but the way they worked their way towards it (if there was a way at all) is nothing that made any sense whatsoever. Yes there are a handful ways to discuss this ending or interpret it (was he retarded and never on an island in fact just wandering around the country?), but this is only the case because the film lacks focus and convincing storytelling from start to finish. It can be an achievement to get the audience to discuss your movie/ending, but it is not a success here because the only reason the ending is difficult to understand is because it's all so vague and shoddy from Scheinert and Kwan. A definite contender for worst film of 2016 from what I have seen so far. And I have seen a lot. Stay far, far away from ""Swiss Army Man"".",Swiss Army Man
2,nogodnomasters,Could I just go back to being dead?,4,28 August 2017,"Hank Thomas (Paul Dano) is stranded on an island and doesn't want to die alone. Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) a corpse washes up on the beach which interrupts Hank's suicide. Hank uses Manny as a boat and makes it to the main land of Northern California where they survive in the woods off of trash. Hank creates a menagerie with the trash and has long conversations about life, love, and relationships with Manny...clearly an extension of himself.This is another ""Emperor has no clothes film"" which people say they like to look cool and intellectual. It was painfully boring. I believed the film was (and still could be) extensional as Hank was in the process of killing himself and nothing made any sense. The dialogue was pseudo insightful and certainly not entertaining. More entertaining than the Redford boat film, but not as good as Tom Hanks' island. A mediocre attempt at cute and clever.",Swiss Army Man
3,kosmasp,More than just a one joke idea/film,10,17 April 2017,"Yes you can reduce this to the one thing that's probably very prominent in the trailer. But the farting ""joke"" is more than meets the eye. You can smell, I mean tell by watching. Seriously though, the movie does not run out of ... fumes. You know it's easy making even more jokes, but the movie itself or the filmmakers are serious about being funny and inventive at the same time.Having former Harry Potter in a, well passive role like this is amazing. He tries and in this case succeeds shedding the shell of the magician others put on him (yes you can also say hood). On the other hand the things being done here can feel like magic too. The movie is pretty insane and weird and very much out there. I guess you can compare it with Cast Away (the Tom Hanks movie) and Radcliffes character to Mr. Wilson in that movie.I think the filmmakers did a great job and it's not only borderline crazy but also genius. If you like weird and unexpected than this is for you. I also love the fact that even at the ending, when you think ""ok the movie finally faltered"", it pulls an ace (or something with two ""s"") out of its ... well enough of the jokes. Let's just say I can highly recommend this movie",Swiss Army Man
4,gavin6942,A Strange One,7,2 May 2017,"A hopeless man (Paul Dano) stranded on a deserted island befriends a dead body (Daniel Radcliffe) and together they go on a surreal journey to get home.When I first saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to see it. The buzz was strong throughout the 2016 festival season. Unfortunately, it took until spring 2017 before it was actually available for me to view. And it was worth it.I will say hat it was not as funny as I thought it would be. The movie is funny, but not purely so. There are more than a few emotional moments mixed in about what it means to be human and alone. This might make it a better more well-rounded film, but i would have preferred the straight humor.",Swiss Army Man
5,lee_eisenberg,Harry Potter meets Brian Wilson,6,17 October 2016,"In a continuation of his post-Harry Potter career, Daniel Radcliffe plays a corpse that comes back to life and befriends a man (Paul Dano). Isolated from society, they form their own world. ""Swiss Army Man"" is sort of a weird movie, and silly at times, but I thought that it was a good movie overall. My favorite scenes were the bus scenes. Above all I'm glad to see that Radcliffe has managed to transition to different kinds of roles (including ""Kill Your Darlings"", wherein he played a young Allen Ginsberg). I hope that his career continues (as does that of Emma Watson, who has spent her post-Harry Potter career drawing attention to women's issues). In the meantime, ""Swiss Army Man"" is worth seeing, if only once.",Swiss Army Man
6,paul_haakonsen,A rather confusing movie...,5,14 August 2017,"I had no idea what to expect from this movie, and all I knew about it was that it was about a man marooned and that Daniel Radcliffe played a dead man who washed up on the beach.This is definitely one of the weirder movies that I have watched in quite some time. And at times it was so far out there that is stopped being funny and it felt like directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert just took it too far.The acting in the movie was good, despite it being a very small cast. And both Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe performed quite well with their given roles. And they had to perform quite well in order to carry the movie, as they were alone on the screen most of the entire movie. I must say that especially Paul Dano was shining here, because he went all in for this particular role. I think it was a very bald choice of a movie and a character for Daniel Radcliffe, but it was a very nice change of pace to watch him in a movie as odd as ""Swiss Army Man"" turned out to be.There were some pretty hilarious moments throughout the course of the movie between the Hank (played by Paul Dano) and Manny (played by Daniel Radcliffe) characters.However, I must admit that I didn't really understand the story. It was entertaining, but I don't think I really grasped the full concept of the story that writers Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan had at heart here. It was somewhat confusing and seemed to become a scrambled mess of even more confusion towards the end when they finally found civilization.Despite having some very hilarious moments, then ""Swiss Army Man"" is hardly a movie that warrants a second viewing.",Swiss Army Man
7,Quinoa1984,"confounding, funny, wild, bewildering, disappointing, deep, touching, an experience and a half",6,7 July 2016,"It's not often we get movies like Swiss Army Man. You have to give the ""Daniels"" that much as filmmakers - they make going to see a movie at a 16-screen multiplex at a mall into an experience that you can't don't have every day. It hasn't been since, I don't know, Under the Skin when I was staggering out of a movie theater wondering what the f*** I just sat through passing by kiosks and pretzel stands with muzak and whiny kids passing me by in the hallways. This is because Swiss Army Man functions like a fever dream concocted by dudes who are equal parts visionary mad-philosophical geniuses and Beavis & Butt-head. In Siskel & Ebert boil-it-down-terms, it's actually a thumbs down for me, but it's the most admirable thumbs down I'd give in a decade.If you watch the trailer it appears as if the premise is set fairly succinctly: Paul Dano is Hank, a guy stranded on a deserted island who is ready to kill himself when he sees the corpse of Daniel Radcliffe wash up on the beach. Hank decides maybe he should hold off (is he alive, he's not sure on first glance) and gets out of his noose to see him. Nope, he's dead, and more than that he's... gassy, farting up like he's eating beans around the fire in Blazing Saddles. But it turns out these farts make him, well, useful, and over the title card we see Dano riding Radcliffe's farting self on the seas. He may be even more useful, and so a journey is set out to find 'home' possibly. I think what I admire so much is that these directors surely have something that sets them apart which is knowing how to use a camera and editing - they come from music videos, I think, and their timing and their cuts show how well they cut rhythmically, with music by Andy Hull & Robert McDowell that often will come in as Dano sings a few bars - and so at least in that sense it's certainly never boring. And I like these two actors and, yes, their chemistry: Radcliffe actually does talk a lot (he may be the most talkative 'zombie' I've seen in a modern film), and he talks as if he's learning all new things (because, since he's resurrected, he is), but Dano has to carry practically all of the emotion of the film - the wild, zany joy, the delirious, the sadness, the comic grief and anguish, and much of the madness and insanity. He can do it all, though Radcliffe's role as 'Manny' is trickier since he is, you know, dead, and lacks expression but still does so much (my favorite scene and the most touching, as he expresses what it means to live and die from atop a tree branch as Hank is being dragged away by a bear).I say all of this and tell you that if you have some interest in seeing it and want my recommendation I firmly believe that you should go see it... it's too weird. Or it may be the simple thing of not 'getting it' all in one viewing, though I don't know if I'd be tempted to sit down to see it again, not for a long time. It piles on the gross-out jokes, which is fine, and I was with it at first. Then it continues to get stranger and more outlandish with how Hank tries to get Manny to understand what, uh, 'love' is and feelings and new ways to get his boner to point out so it can work as the compass. I was engaged with the material but unsure if the filmmakers even knew where to take it after a while, like a skit that's overrun its course. And then it comes to the climax of the film, when the characters are revealed to be (spoiler) NOT stranded on an island this whole time. It feels like a cop-out or a cheat, like Shyamalan's The Village or something, like 'THIS is what was happening, are you s***ing me?' I wish I could have a stronger intellectual argument for my criticism of where the film ends up in its resolution, but it's hard to articulate it. Swiss Army Man works a great deal on how emotionally you read into this situation, how a man who is talking with a corpse that isn't really talking to him (... OR IS HE?? no, he isn't, it's in his head, relax), and how this metaphor for life and death gets played out with Hank over and over in these woods. But if you start to put pieces together it doesn't make much sense past 'well, the guy's a complete nut-job and so... should I care?' In case I haven't stressed it enough yet, this is one of the weirdest sits I've had in a major motion picture release, certainly in the midst of a summer movie season. Not that that should matter, and if anything the audacity for these filmmakers to find the millions to put this together (I'm sure even on a low budget it wasn't cheap to some of the farting effects and locations, not to mention the two leads) is worth applause. But the filmmakers are also being weird for weird's sake, like it's an affectation to bring up the same quirky music that at first is rousing and funny and later on becomes like a musical tic.It even has something to say I'm sure about masculinity and the role of what men look for in themselves and women and how they view things as elemental as masturbation and gratification (a long deceased mother of Hank's is brought up more than once, as well as a disappointed dad). So... there's a lot to unpack here. Too much, probably. But I'd rather have too much than not enough.",Swiss Army Man
8,zardoz-13,"Delirious, Disgusting, But Delighftul",8,20 November 2016,"The title of the iconoclastic epic ""Swiss Army Man,"" co-directed by freshman filmmakers Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan, refers to the various uses that their protagonist makes of a corpse in their surrealistic, avant-garde, exercise in buffoonish comedy that teeters on the edge of necrophilia. Imagine crossing the Tom Hanks' survival yarn ""Castaway"" with Ted Kotcheff's ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and you'll have a vague idea about the shenanigans of this 97-minute saga that blends art with fart. Basically, a desperate dude stranded on a desert island poised to hang himself, Hank Thompson (Paul Dano of ""Cowboys & Aliens""), spots the corpse of a man in a business suit, Manny (Daniel Radcliffe of the ""Harry Potter"" franchise), wash up on the shore. When he sets off to check out this new arrival, Hank forgets to loosen the noose and almost hangs himself. If you think that these opening moments are bizarre, wait until you watch (if you can) what ensues. Ultimately, this above-average, sometimes creative, often contrived buddy picture, unfolds as a meaningful relationship between a living person and a dead person. Ironically, Manny gives Hank several reasons to live, and therein lies the significance of the title. For example, Hank draws water from Manny, and he exploits him as a source of taking a shower in another scene. Later, he relies on Manny's erect penis to furnish him with serviceable compass readings about what direction that they should pursue to find civilization. At one point, earlier in the narrative, Manny provides Hank with a way to get off the small island to which he has been confined; this scene reminded me of the DVD cover art to the 2002 movie ""Whale Rider."" Actually, the propulsive power that Hank derives from Manny is generated by the gaseous content of his body as he cruises through the ocean as he facetious were straddling a Jet Ski. Eventually, this funny buddy picture turns into a road picture of sorts with Hank toting Manny around in a fireman's hold as he struggles through the wilderness. Just like a western that boils down to riding and shooting between campfire conversations, ""Swiss Army Man"" takes another weird left-turn, and Manny the corpse acquires the power of speech and the two guys discuss the idiocrasies of life. Inevitably, since this is a movie about two dudes, the guys talk about masturbation. After struggling through the woods, creeping along a pipeline suspended over a river, battling a bear, they arrive in the backyard of a house where the remainder of the cast show up. ""Swiss Army Man"" qualifies as a distinctly different type of movie, with ingenious set designs, that Scheinert and Kwan string out from an oddball premise that is so deliriously delightful that it defies its own dementia. Clearly, Scheinert and Kwan refuse to be confined either by the rules of filmmaking or life. Interestingly, Daniel Radcliffe has called this cult film his favorite film, probably because of its strange nature. Squeamish spectators who require credibility from their filmgoing experiences may have problems with this outing. Now, ""Swiss Army Man"" is just the kind of movie that aliens billions of light years from Earth need to watch to know what to expect when they arrive. Whatever you think about it, ""Swiss Army Man"" will give anybody a lot to talk about.",Swiss Army Man

Though the Karma Chameleon soon robbed this Perverter of Childhood of her singing voice, the harm was done, since the sagging cats already were out of the Old Bag. Similarly, some rave reviews have been written about SWISS ARMY MAN, which just proves that many if not most so-called movie critics are sleazy perverts out to trick Americans into paying to view Trash & Abomination, which they will NEVER be able to Unsee. (More than half the people who were ambushed by Julie's Jugs have perished already!) What sick molester of Childhood Heroes would go up to Harry Potter and suggest it would make a great film if he became The Wizard of Farts, complete with a Ron Weasley stand-in to poke at the Magic Wand in his trousers?! Obviously, Hollywood forgot to provide Master Daniel Radcliffe with a studio teacher to instruct him about Life Choices, which is the only explanation for him being too dumb to realize that NO ONE would finance a Fart Wizard flick UNLESS it featured Harry Potter in the key role! Of course, the joke's on him, and Tinseltown for wasting screen time on this disaster in order to rake in the astounding sum of $246,169 in total domestic box office.

10,george.schmidt,Out-there black comedy; a dramedy with farts; You've been warned.,6,4 July 2016,"SWISS ARMY MAN (2016) ** Paul Dano, Daniel Radcliffe, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Out-there black comedy with Dano as a deserted island survivor who finds an unlikely bromance blossom when a corpse literally washes ashore in the form of Radcliffe (doing Buster Keaton proud in the solemn faced slapstick required with Herculean efforts) which acts as a metaphor for their relationship (is it all part of his imagination or is this actually happening?) as well as questioning one's mental health and place in the universe. While it is a somewhat original premise if you overlook say Castaway the dynamic duo pass the test in endurance from filmmaking team Dan Kwan and Dan Scheinert yet it also tests the audience's patience particularly with the chronic flatulence (yep a dramedy with farts).

11,evanston_dad,Muddled Direction Undermines Intriguing Premise,5,17 November 2016,"I appreciated the conceit of ""Swiss Army Man,"" and I've always said that I would prefer a film that goes out on a limb and fails to a film that plays it safe and provides moderate enjoyment, but the execution of this film just didn't work for me. The film tries to be funny and touching in equal measures, but doesn't succeed in ever being fully either.Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are quite good in physically strenuous roles, but they're hampered by uneven direction that results in some scenes being static and going on for too long while others whiz by in a muddle leaving the audience confused. By the time the film hit its mid-way point, everything on screen just started to feel like fussy business without a point, and I had trouble paying attention or caring about how the story was going to resolve itself. Knowing now how the film plays out, I feel like I would benefit from a second viewing, but I didn't enjoy the film enough the first time to ever have the incentive to sit down and watch it again.This film feels like a movie for our anxious and troubled times; I just wish it had hit its mark more accurately.Grade: C",Swiss Army Man
12,FlashCallahan,Before the internet every girl was a lot more special....,10,3 October 2016,"Being stranded on a deserted island leaves Hank bored, lonely and without hope. Hank prepares to end it all, and he puts a noose around his neck, when he suddenly spots a man laying on the shore. The man is dead, but surprisingly quite flatulent. Using the flatulence in the body to his advantage, Hank miraculously it back to the mainland. But now he finds himself lost in the wilderness, and dragging the talking corpse named Manny along for the adventure, and for some wise words of advice.....Every once in a while there is a film released that is just so out there, just so random, that it just shouts out originality from the get go. This is that film, and I can almost guarantee that you've never seen anything like it before, or anything like it again.But the wonderful thing about this film is how it throws you so many times, and then takes you in completely the different direction you thought the film was heading. How many directions could a film about a suicidal loner and a corpse could there be I hear you ask?Mark my words, if you see the film, you will totally understand where I am coming from. Could this be a film about someone questioning their own sanity, or having a wonderful sense of self realisation? After all when Hank first meets Manny, he has metaphorically come to terms with the fact there is no point in going on, so is the films narrative beyond the noose just some hallucination whilst he's in purgatory? Because with the bizarre things that happen between the two, it's impossible to think otherwise, after all the film does have a fantasy element to it, but it isn't dreamy enough to let the fantasy overtake the reality.Dano is wonderful as Hank, and once again proves he is one of the most versatile actors working today. But Radcliffe, Radcliffe steals the film as Manny, the friendly corpse. It's not the acting that wins him the film, it's his physicality that really impresses here. As Manny, he's more animated than any of the other characters in the film. As the film progresses, the develop a very deep self awareness of themselves, and each other, and strangely enough, one of the most beautiful cinematic friendships is depicted here.The ending, while uplifting, is strange and sombre, with Hank realising that life would be better with him and Manny, because no matter how beautiful your imagination and daydreams are, reality can shatter them with one fell swoop.It's a brilliant film, easily one of the years best, and don't be put off by the flatulence, the delicious score more than makes up for the dulcet tones of Mannys trouser trumpet.Essential viewing..",Swiss Army Man

And I'm normally not that picky. But when a movie doesn't make any sense at all then I get bored, in this case really bored. I'll give it a three star rating just for the fart jokes, because fart jokes are always funny. For the rest the story-line is just weird and most of the time ridiculous. But not ridiculous in a funny way. Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe didn't act bad or so, it's just the story that is bad. I honestly don't get why this movie gets such a high rating on here. I saw so much better movies with a lower score that sometimes I wonder how we can all be so different when it's about taste.

'Swiss Army Man' Synopsis: A hopeless man stranded on a deserted island befriends a dead body and together they go on a surreal journey to get home.'Swiss Army Man' is about finding hope, even in the worst case scenario. Our protagonist finds hope in a dead body, that comes to life & passes gas every now and then. And the living & the dead form an unlikely friendship in the wilderness, that later converts into complete bromance. 'Swiss Army Man' is daringly dysfunctional & its sense of humor isn't the type, that would appeal to one & all, but its an effort you can't shun away! I, honestly, didn't find myself disconnected from this story. I rather enjoyed its madness.Dan Kwan & Daniel Scheinert's Screenplay is entirely weird, but its engaging & even affecting at times. Their Direction, on the other-hand, nicely compliments their Writing, keeping the narrative fantasy-like all through. Cinematography is brilliant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are flawless. Make-Up merits a special mention. Andy Hull & Robert McDowell's Score is wonderful.Performance-Wise: Paul Dano & Daniel Radcliffe turn up 'Swiss Army Man'. Dano, An Acting Giant, brings depth & desperation as the heartbroken & hopeless leading-man, while Radcliffe plays it dead a bit too perfectly & creates an infectious camaraderie with Dano. Together, they are a delight to watch! Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a cameo & she's good, as always.On the whole, 'Swiss Army Man' isn't everyone's cup of tea.

15,lasttimeisaw,a decent comedy out of left field,7,29 November 2016,"American indie directors-duo DANIELS' feature debut, SWISS ARMY MAN is a gonzo buddy movie hinges on the peculiar bonding a stranded young man Hank Thompson (Dano) and a farting corpse whom he names Manny (Radcliffe). If this premise sounds pretty crass to you, wait to be shocked and stunned, its title itself manifestly signifies Manny as a multi-functional tool like a Swiss army knife, an ass-bared, farts-powered water jet in the title sequence is just the beginning, he will shepherd Hank back to human society in a nexus of capers coming about in the jungle, which, in retrospect, is not that far from civilization, and further obfuscates the boundary between reality and imagination.Any logical preconception will ascertain viewers that Hank is delusional, to say the least, a retiring soul on the brink of giving up his life when his eyes alight on Manny, awash to the lonesome shore, we are never informed how Hank arrived in the island in the first place, and bolstered by a shark- jumping ending, every possible cerebral interpretation has been arbitrarily pigeonholed in a moot position, which is a double-edged sword to elicit polarized responses. But there is beauty in Hank and Manny's logic-defying home-coming journey, whether the latter is a bona-fide corpse Hank befriends and carries around, or is entirely a product of his psychotic head-space when he encounters the lightning before death, all depends on one's glass-is-half- empty-or-half-full perspective, the film's reflexive and coruscating vibe speaks volumes of the basic rapport between two friends, Manny is recreated as a tabula rasa incessantly pops rudimentary questions while stay immobile in his zombie appearance, from excruciatingly banal convos about family, love, erection to more salutary insights on Hank's Oedipus Complex, fears of masturbation and a new approach to discern beauty in quotidian life. While Hank takes the chance to sort out his own forlorn misery, the strained relationship with his father (Gross) after the early death of his mom, the unrequited affection to Sarah (Winstead), a girl whom he constantly meets on the bus, but doesn't have the gut to initiate a small talk. They are all components of cliché yet limned with nimble tenderness and affective earnestness to DANIELS' lights. In a bolder move, Hank conducts a therapeutic cross-dressing play-acting to guide Manny into a Sarah-courting procedure, up to a homoerotic clincher when they share an underwater kiss, totally necrophiliac but transcendently heart-warming. The center-duo certainly enjoys a wild ride during a short 22-day shooting, It is rather in his wheel- house for Paul Dano portraying strung-out eccentrics harboring a tragic psyche, and Daniel Radcliffe, does put his back into exploring characters on the off-beaten path in his post-Harry Potter career-choices, they rounds off with plucking an emotional chord in this heady, quirky and surprisingly edifying tale borne out of a woeful reality.Aided by a kaleidoscope of snazzy editing by Matthew Hannam, its lilting, a cappella-exclusive soundtrack confected by Atlanta indie band Manchester Orchestra, DANIELS's defiantly crude, vibrantly whimsical and dichotomy-straddling fantasy definitely goes out on a limb to be a comedy out of left field, and it is a horizon-widening brainwave can generate a sizable degree of reverberations for those who are able to overlook the somewhat obscene antics and look a little bit beyond the surface.",Swiss Army Man
16,KineticSeoul,"Creative, strange and sensitive film with a LOT of imagination",9,2 October 2016,This is probably the first film I have seen where farting plays a pivotal part in the story itself. And not just for humor or to stop something from happening. But in this it works as a metaphor as well. Well enough about farting. I will just say that this is one heck of a creative and original work I have seen in quite awhile. The story starts off with Paul Dano's character stranded on a island. But when a dead body played by Daniel Radcliffe washes to shore things start to become very strange and awkward. This film delves upon the human mind and how we sometimes keep things bottled up inside. Instead of showing who we really are because of the fear of being judged. And how sometimes you can actually use fear to push yourself forward instead of letting it succumb you. What made this film really stand out was the creative and heavily original way it shows these messages. When it comes to Daniel Radcliffe there isn't any previous performances he did that made him really stand out for me. But he really does stand out in this one and it's probably one of the most ballsy performances he has done so far. Overall this film really did a great job of bringing out all these emotions in a very creative and amusing manner. Which also integrates some very awkward and odd black humor. This film shows that sometimes sensitivity and a bit of insecurity (as long as it doesn't put others down) isn't a bad thing.9/10,Swiss Army Man
17,Hellmant,"One of the weirdest films I've ever seen, but I did enjoy it (quite a bit).",9,2 November 2016,"'SWISS ARMY MAN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)An extremely bizarre comedy-drama adventure; about a suicidal man that befriends a dead body, which he finds on a deserted island! The film was written and directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (also known as DANIELS), in their feature film directorial debut. It stars Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. The movie did well in indie theaters, and it also got mostly positive reviews from critics. Despite it being one of the weirdest films I've ever seen, I did enjoy it (quite a bit). Hank (Dano) has been stranded on a deserted island for some time (as the film opens). He's about to kill himself, out of loneliness and depression, when a dead body (Radcliffe) washes up on shore. Hank soon discovers that the body has strange supernatural abilities, and he's able to use it's powers like a Swiss Army knife. Hank names it Manny, and the corpse soon starts speaking as well. The two then go on an adventure together, in an effort to find their way home. The movie is really weird; even more weird than I had imagined, after seeing the incredibly bizarre trailer for it. Despite it being a really strange film, it does seem to have some very insightful things to say about mental illness, loneliness, and depression. It's beautifully directed, and the score is perfectly fitting as well. Dano and Radcliffe also both give amazing performances in it too. Then the movie ends, and the climax left me feeling even more weirded out than the entire film that preceded it.

18,cherold,The world's most melancholy fart joke,5,1 March 2017,"From the trailer this movie looked like a lot of fun; a crazy dark comedy about a talking corpse whose body can be used as a speedboat and to start fires. Crazy fun, right?Yet, the movie is quite cheerless. Yes, there are comedic moments throughout, but there is also a palpable sense of unhappiness.As far as I can tell, the two directors, who have worked on nutty shows like NTSF:SUV, started with a crazy low-comedy idea and then decided to make it profound. The end result attempts to split the difference between pathos and comedy, and for me the end result is something that is a frankly kind of boring.The most interesting part of the movie is the final section in which you learn where its creators were going with this. It's actually pretty thought provoking. But I really didn't enjoy watching this, and if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't.",Swiss Army Man

It's an ambiguous tale of a man and his all-purpose, walking, talking, farting dead body. It's actually incredibly entertaining, if flawed, and commendably unique, to say the least. It's a little rough around the edges but is usually always intriguing and enjoyable, propelled by some offbeat humour, a few unconventionally good performances and a strange but delightful 'a Capella' soundtrack. 7/10",Swiss Army Man

En route, he teaches the carcass about love using Sarah (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) as an example. Now, Manny wants to find Sarah so he can confess his love for her.A divisive film if ever there was, Swiss Army Man attempts to dissect deep psychological issues using dead dick and fart jokes to do it.

Yet, it's still somewhat OK to eat.",7,10 October 2016,"Swiss Army Man is one really bizarre polarizing movie. It's weird for weird sakes. This is one-of-a-kind unique movie not often produced in Hollywood. The avant-garde nature of this film is really imaginative. It was a fun, interesting, unique film. The way, the film was shot was beautiful. Great use of slow motion and quick action. This is what happens if director Spike Jonze and Michel Gondy overdose on LDS, died, and was resurrection as the filmmaking duos, Dan Kwan and Daniel Schienert. This is what type of film, they would had made. A film that doesn't make any logically sense, made out of things, they really dislike about life. It's like a wackiest version of 1960's 'Swiss Family Robinson' mix with 1989's 'Weekend at Bernie's'. Written and directed by Kwan and Schienert, the movie tells the story of a stranded hopeless man, Hank Thompson (Paul Dano) befriends a dead body, Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) while, going through a surreal journey to get home. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, while, I don't mind, the lonely man who is dead inside, talking to a corpse who dead outside, but alive inside; as both Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano was able to pull it off. Yet, I really couldn't get behind the whole fantasy unusual abilities that Manny has. The Jet-propelling farts, erection that can be used as a compass, and water fountain spit scenes, seem a bit too out-there for me, to really like. It looks way too wacky to be, taken serious. It really did take me, out of the film for a bit. I really couldn't tell, where the film was taking itself serious or not with the physical elements of survival. Nevertheless, the movie focus a little too long, on them, playing far fantasy around in the woods, than them, trying to survive in a realistic way. The length of the film could had been cut, a bit, because of that. Still, I can't really hate those moments, because it did give us, the most delightful, yet joyful parts of the film. Yet, I can't say, the same with the endless amount of toilet humor. It got tiresome, really fast, even with the message, they trying to go for. I understand that they're using farts as a way to show that people shouldn't hold everything back, because of social norms, but there is reasons, why we, as a society have preconceived notions on what normal or not. Honestly, do you really want somebody to fart in your face, all the time!? The answer is probably, not, because it's stink and unhealthy to breath in. I'm sorry, but you just can't let out gas, everywhere. Farts do stink! Yes, it's prove that you still, somewhat alive, but some people just don't want to hear it, because it's bothersome to their own lives. There is a reason why 'too much information' was made. There is a limited to what people want to hear. Yes, I get it, it's what happens, when somebody dies, but we as a society, don't like to be reminded of the death. Its reasons why jokes like this, fail so badly. I know, the filmmakers put it in the film to troll, their audience, but it's hard to laugh at the joke, when you don't get the punchline. It's sad, because I like crass morbid humor. However, I didn't mind, the movie's frequent discussions of bodily functions and death. It wasn't a turn-off for me. Just the stupid low brow jokes that came with it. I like how they use it as a metaphor for the need to be true to oneself. Although, those scenes was thought-provoking, I thought, the best scenes in the film is the trash scenes where Hank builds various events to show Manny, what is life is meaningful, in order to turn him, more human. It's where we see the companionship between Manny and Hank, blossom. Taboo necrophilia courtship has never been so cute and lovely. I love how the film was edited as if Hank and Manny could be the same person. After all, you really don't see Hank talk over Manny. Whether or not, Manny is a metaphor for Hank's mind. You really do believe, that they honestly felt for each other. This is where Paul and Daniel shine the best in their acting. Daniel is very believable as the goofy dead body, while Paul is amazing as the straight man. I also like the twist toward the end with them with Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character, Sarah. Yet, I thought the movie could had done, better with that ending. It was kinda anticlimax. Although, the ending was a disappointment; the music that went along with this movie was not. Songs like 'Montage' and 'Cotton Eye Joe' were amazing. I like how all the songs in the soundtrack was sung acapella in tune with the idea that Hank is making this things up as he goes. It was very striking, seeing how some songs sound similar to Neil Young's 1991 'Philadelphia' spiritual soundtrack and other film scores. 'Cave Ballad' & 'A Better Way' really shows that. It's makes kinda sense with that theory. If not, it might be a bit lazy, but still somewhat spectacular. Great work by singers, Andy Hull and Robert McDowell, regardless. Overall: 'Swiss Army Man' is a very profound heartfelt story about acceptance & approval. That's both smart and very stupid. It's strives to break down all of preconceived notions that society has set up for us, allowing it's viewers, a new viewpoint on improvement by promoting self-confidence, friendship and teamwork in the most uncommon manner, possible. In the end, it's a mix bag that only you can open up to see. For me, I kinda like it. For you; I don't know. Still, I do highly recommended checking it out.",Swiss Army Man
26,Reno-Rangan,Two strangers in an unusual circumstance take a weirdest journey.,5,24 October 2016,"My initial thought was this is a new version of 'Weekend at Bernie's', but very soon I realised it is not. This film is a bit disgusting. Watching alone makes okay or with the close buddies, but not good for beyond that. I totally appreciate the effort and obviously the fresh idea for a film from the Hollywood, but the film is not a masterpiece or entertaining. Because a plot like this is not worth for a 90 minute stretch. It should have been a short film or the story should have developed to a better one.There are lots of questions regarding the film. The film did not detail everything it showed, so that's the first negative about it. It opened with a young man stranded on a tiny island who tries to commit suicide, but abandons the plan and takes a weirdest ride in the sea seeking land to get rescued by its people. Though he's not alone, a strange young man accompanies him. So it's like theirs journey of self-discovery, but how it all ends is the crucial final segment.Both the young actors were good in theirs very challenging roles, particularly Daniel Radcliffe. The directors too to be praised for managing to pull it off so well. But it was the screenplay that did not deliver as I anticipated. The film was different, but nothing impressive at all, so I think it is good for watching at once. Maybe if I understand or get the answers for my doubts, I might change might stance. For now this is an average film.5/10",Swiss Army Man
27,sol-,Corpse Pride,6,17 March 2017,"Stranded on a desert island, a suicidal young man strikes up a friendship with a corpse that washes ashore after discovering that he can use the cadaver in many ways, like a Swiss army knife, in this offbeat comedy starring Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. The film is rather slow to warm up, but once Radcliffe's corpse wakes up and starts conversing with Dano, there is nary a dull moment to be had. The humour is very hit-and-miss with the overload of flatulence and erection jokes tiring well before the end, however, there are several genuinely funny moments as the pair converse. It never quite makes sense that Radclifffe remembers certain things about life but has forgotten other elements, however, the best moments of the film come from Dano teaching Radcliffe about social conventions, in turn being given much to think about due to Radcliffe's ignorance about the world at large. ""If my best friend hides his farts from me, then what else is he hiding from me?"" is an especially memorable line. Promising as all this might sound, the film nevertheless exhausts the originality of the premise before it is over. The final few scenes of the movie are pitch perfect with a nice blur between fantasy and reality, but there are a few too many moments of the pair role playing in the woods and not quite enough moments of Dano using Radcliffe's body in creative ways to really justify the title. This is a daringly different sort of comedy for sure, but unless you are really into scatological humour, one's mileage here will almost certainly vary.",Swiss Army Man
28,eddie_baggins,Harry Potter as you've never seen him before,5,19 October 2016,"He may've come face to face with Voldemort, ridden a Hippofgriff, caught a snitch with his mouth and generally been a legend but we sure as ever have never seen Harry Potter like this or doing things of this nature.Daniels (made up of directing duo Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) film about Paul Dano's unfortunate soul Hank Thompson whose found himself lost at sea and all alone, until that is he finds Daniel Radcliffe's flatulent prone corpse who we eventually become to know as Manny after he miraculous comes back to life (or something akin to it) is not only one of 2016 biggest oddities but one of cinemas most curiously amusing tales and that the film is even half as enjoyable as it even is is something to take note of as a film about a weirdo stalker and his fart producing corpse best friend doesn't exactly seem like the stuff of quality movie material.Much of Swiss Army Man's saving graces stem from not only Daniels quirky directional ticks that call to mind an abstract version of a Wes Anderson film (with additional wind) but the commitment of the two aforementioned actors who each dive headfirst (and bums up) into this utterly bonkers feature that at its core is trying to say rather big things about life, love and friendship albeit with a wind infused flavour.It's a wild journey as Hank's travails to survive ramp up but it's an experience that slowly but surely runs out of gas (please don't pardon the pun) and while there are genuine moments of laugh out loud hilarity and a few odd but somehow touching moments, at the end of it all, especially after a rather disappointing finale, Swiss Army Man feels like long-winded take on a rather simplistic premise, no matter how odd it may at first seem.The commitment by its cast and drive to be something utterly different (plus perhaps an attempt at breaking the record for most farts in a singular movie) can be commended but this well shot and put together indie trip ends up being a rather forgettable experience, disappointing then for a film where Eli Sunday finds himself riding Harry Potter like a jet ski through the open seas, propelled only by a sense of stoic determination and a magic belly full of what seems like an endless supply of potent gasses.2 ½ gassy Harry Potter's out of 5",Swiss Army Man

30,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A movie without equal, ""Swiss Army Man"" makes no sense and complete sense all at once",6,23 December 2016,"Profound genius or puerile nonsense, there's no incorrect interpretation of the distinctive piece of something captured on film that is Daniels' ""Swiss Army Man."" Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's feature film debut walks the proverbial line between genius and insanity and audience opinion will likely be equally schizophrenic, in the non-medical sense of the term.Both affectionately and cynically labeled ""the Daniel Radcliffe farting corpse movie"" after its premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, ""Swiss Army Man"" follows a young man named Hank (Paul Dano) who is stranded on a deserted island and contemplating suicide when a corpse (Radcliffe) washes ashore. Believing it a sign, Hank rushes over to the body, at which point it begins farting, so much so that it can propel itself off the beach and through the water, like a boat. Suddenly, Hank has hope for survival.Eventually, Hank discovers that this body has many uses – hence the title of the film. He can spew fresh water, start fires and even some things that if mentioned would spoil the ""fun,"" but no function is more valuable than the companionship he provides to Hank, especially as he slowly becomes more animated and alive (despite being quadriplegic). Manny, as he calls himself, has no knowledge of what he is or any past he might have had, which makes him an ideal friend for the lost soul that is Hank.What follows is a series of alternating philosophical conversations and sequences of bawdy magical realism. Hank and Manny talk about life and girls, fears and sex, and they roleplay typical human interactions. Then Hank discovers Manny's latest body trick and it propels them on their journey. All this is set to a soundtrack built around looped vocalizations that the characters actually sing at points throughout the film. The whole thing is indescribable and utterly unique; resonant at some points and infuriating at others, captivating one minute and deserving of being walked away from the next.Dano and Radcliffe, for their part, sell this movie pretty well. The role is right in Dano's wheelhouse as a character that's not all there, and while it's hard to imagine that the kid who once played Harry Potter is the guy now playing a motionless farting corpse, Radcliffe really commits to the part and comes across as believable as a flatulent ragdoll can. It isn't enough for us to connect to and feel for Manny, but enough to get us to follow along on their misadventure and process where the Daniels might be going with this thing.Holding our attention is easily the Daniels' greatest success with ""Swiss Army Man."" For all its dubiously poignant psychobabble, there's the lingering feeling that perhaps somewhere at the end of this film is a powerful underlying truth that will inform the crass and nonsensical events we've witnessed to this point. The ending turns out to be pretty exciting, but nothing is ever as strong as the promise of what the outcome will be.The Daniels definitely communicate what in the film is intended to be meaningful and connect with a more serious truth about the human condition, but at no point does it ever truly make sense to the viewer, or – more importantly – connect with the emotions. It's all intellectual. They go so big with their ideas that the likely well- intentioned origins of those ideas get lost.At the same time, these ideas are rich, and the truths that they hint at land far better than anyone would expect from a movie that uses farting to make a point about self-acceptance and vulnerability. The bottom line is that ""Swiss Army Man"" is crafted well enough, acted well enough and imbued with enough thoughtful intention that it can prompt a conversation worth having, even among viewers who won't care for it or were downright offended by it~Steven CThanks for reading!

Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe were a hilarious duo. Paul plays a guy who isolation and obsession has hit hard to the point where he befriends a random dead body, played by Daniel Radcliffe, a difficult task as Radcliffe had to play dead in the movie and allow Dano to do things to his body (or the cool prosthetic they used in his place).

32,jtindahouse,What did I just watch?,5,1 March 2017,"I could go ahead and say that 'Swiss Army Man' is a film that some people will love, and others will hate. But then I would have to justify to you what exactly some people would love about it, and I'm not sure I can do that. To be perfectly honest I'm not even entirely sure what I just saw. If this film looks weird in the posters (and trailers I assume, having not actually seen them) then you can be assured it's about 10 times weirder when you actually watch it.Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe were the two aspects of the film I actually enjoyed. There's something about Dano I can't quite put my finger on, but I like it. He's the kind of guy you feel like you could be friends with in real life, as apposed to most movie stars who seem like they would be above it. Radcliffe on the other hand, I'm not usually the biggest fan of, although here I was very impressed. I liked his American accent (even with the bizarre line delivery throughout the entire movie) and found that he gave a performance, that can't have been the least bit easy, with a lot of class.I can't recommend 'Swiss Army Man' to be watched.

33,Turfseer,Robinson Crusoe meets Weekend at Bernie's in one of the most bizarre films of the year!,3,8 November 2016,"As indicated in the opening credits of Swiss Army Man, the film was directed by ""Daniels"" (i.e. two Daniels, Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert). It may be the most bizarre film you've ever seen and it stars two A-list actors, Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. Radcliffe's decision to become involved in this project is understandable—he'll do anything to play a part that is as far removed from Harry Potter as possible. But Dano? It's hard to understand why the actor who was so good as the Beach Boys Brian Wilson in ""Love & Mercy,"" would choose to become involved in this claptrap.Dano plays the protagonist Hank. When we first meet him, he's marooned on an uninhabited island, attempting to hang himself due to loneliness and the prospect of never being found. Suddenly, he spies a dead body (Radcliffe), that's just been washed up on the shoreline. It seems that this corpse has an unlimited amount of methane gas still in its system and involuntarily emits it, in a stunning display of uncontrolled flatulence. The next thing you know Hank is riding the corpse like a jet ski, propelled by a steady stream of gas, ending up on a deserted mainland shore. Hank soon develops a relationship with the dead body who incredibly is able to talk intermittently, indicating that his name is Manny. At this point, one is wondering what exactly is going on here. Since Manny is actually dead (he crawls around like a zombie), it's not a great stretch to conclude that Hank is schizophrenic and assigns anthropomorphic qualities to his deceased buddy.The bulk of the film concerns Hank attempting to help Manny recover his memories of his past life. Hank is guided by (if you can believe this), Manny's involuntary erections, which are used as a compass to move around the forest. One of the themes of the film concerns intolerance. Hank is embarrassed by Manny's constant socially unacceptable behavior (e.g. his constant farting), and teaches him how to perform rudimentary ""civilized"" tasks, such as eating out or going to the movies (garbage found in the forest is utilized as props to illustrate socially acceptable behavior).At first, Hank leads Manny to believe that he's in love with a woman named Sarah, whose image can be found on what turns out to be Hank's cell phone. Hank even dresses up as a woman and Manny, through his love for Sarah, believes he can be restored to life and assist Hank in returning to civilization. But when Hank reveals that Manny never knew Sarah, and she's the object of his love, the odd couple have a falling out. Now Manny seeks death but suddenly finds new purpose when Hank is attacked by a bear (indeed it's another one of Manny's farts that lights up their campfire, scares the bear away, and saves Hank from his imminent demise).If all this isn't crazy enough, Manny (again, appearing like a zombie), miraculously lifts himself up and carries Hank to the backyard of the actual Sarah, Hank has been pining for all this time. No need to chronicle in detail what happens next, but suffice it to say Hank (with his father in tow), Sarah and family, local news reporters and the police end up at the shoreline after Hank carries an inanimate Manny there. Presumably this is where Hank originally found (the real) Manny's body. Hank lets out a loud fart after he's handcuffed by the police (and is also presumably hauled off to the local mental institution). Hank's fart of course signifies that he no longer is intolerant as he's learned to accept people (such as Manny), who are ""different."" The source of Hank's madness is perhaps civilization's lack of acceptance of those who fail to accept socially acceptable parameters of behavior.The simplistic message that we all must overcome intolerance reaches its apotheosis when a re-animated Manny suddenly propels himself (again via his bursts of flatulence) out into the ocean, to the shock of the ordinary people on the beach who are revolted by the spectacle of the now more confident dead man's behavior (only Sarah's young daughter approves of Manny's socially unacceptable constant flatulence).Thus, Hank, who has learned his lesson in intolerance (and who is perceived as insane by society), is actually more enlightened, having gone through a journey of catharsis, in his relationship with the socially unacceptable, zombie-like Manny.In the end, Swiss Army Man is hardly as profound as the audience and critics at the various festivals, believe it to be. The simplistic message of overcoming intolerance is ultimately subsumed by the gross machinations of the principals, a one-note exercise designed to shock but ultimately earns the audience's contempt. Only some neat visuals by the two ""Daniels,"" save this childish and pretentious effort from being rated 1 out of 10.",Swiss Army Man
34,meeza,"Radcliffe great, the rest of the movie not so much....",6,1 August 2017,"The bizarre but semi-boring independent movie ""Swiss Army Man"" was not as multi-useful as I thought it was gonna be. In this swiss cheesy flick, Paul Dano stars as Hank; who is stranded in a deserted island and about to commit suicide. But before you take out your hankies for Hank, let me inform you (not spoiler alert, its in the trailer) as he is about to commit the suicidal act, he sees a dead man stranded on the shore of the island beach; this man is called Manny. Hank tries to resuscitate Manny, but to no avail. Then Manny starts to have some gaseous combustion that farts him back to life. OK, that is where I said, maybe this ""Swiss Army Man"" did not switch it up for me. The film was written and directed by a couple of Dans; Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert; and though I credit the Dans for their effort in the originality of the premise, I do have to say that they did not insert enough pizazz to liven up the ""Swiss Army Man"" for me. I do have to credit the film's score and the stupendous performance from Daniel Radcliffe as Manny.

One of the strangest films I've seen in ages, which doesn't shy from its inherent weirdness - rather, it completely embraces it and digs even deeper. Wildly creative and original, it's a feature-length Instagram mixed with an Arcade Fire video. Music is interwoven with the spirit of the film, cropping up organically from the mouths of the two primary characters and gently sprawling until it bounces about the room like a cathedral. The first two acts are absurdly fun, a great blend of cackle-worthy humor and, honest-to-god, legitimate poignancy. It gets a bit heady and loses touch with its silly side on the home stretch, which is a drawback, but I can't say I didn't expect that from the tone of its trailers.

I think growing up as Harry Potter has messed him up. In Horns, his character grew actual horns from his head and the movie was simply mean-spirited. In Swiss Army Man, Radcliffe is a corps that has washed up on shore. Dano's character, who is stranded on a dessert island and about to hang himself, sees the corps and runs to it. The movie becomes surreal as he forms a relationship with the dead corps. So much so, he talks with it and it talks back. Like a dark and twisted version of Cast Away with Tom Hanks. Their interactions are about the most stupid, pointless and gross topics. I guess this is a comedy as there are a slew of awkward potty jokes that get draaaaaaged out to the point of irritation.

40,jadepietro,Dead Man Talking,8,5 July 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: An odd pairing produces an even odder film that works very well due to its lead actors.GRADE: BSYNOPSIS: A lonely castaway befriends a corpse.JIM'S REVIEW: There have always been odd couples in the history of movies: Felix and Oscar, Harold and Maude, Hans Solo and Chewbacca, Thelma and Louise. Yet I cannot think of a more bizarre coupling than Hank (Paul Dano) and Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) in the thought-provoking dramedy by directors Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan called Swiss Army Man.￼Stranded and alone on a deserted island for some time, Hank is ready to end his isolated existence. Until a dead body washed up on shore. It's Manny, aptly named by Hank, who becomes his guiding force and friend. Manny manifests into Hank's survival multi-tool in many ways...camaraderie, a physical compass (more on that later), a gun, an unique method of travel (even more later). As their days spend together continue, so does this bromance with benefits.Now Manny is not the best mannered buddy, rotting and filled with gas that releases itself whenever the mood arises, which is often. The flatulence jokes are non-stop, never more central than when Hank uses his dead buddy as a jet ski. A funny sight gag but not that surprising. At one point, Manny's erect penis serves as a compass. Well, that I must admit, was a surprise!￼Now, we know from the first scene that this relationship exists in the eternal sunshine of Hank's mind. And after accepting that fact, the moviegoer needs to also feel the connection between the pair and their plight. So the casting of the two leads is essential to make this concept work and their both actors' partnership shows off a wonderful bond.Mr. Dano shows a vulnerability and poignancy as Hank, a loner who is now forced to be alone. Mr. Radcliffe has the physically more demanding role as the dead man walking and talking. He plays his part as a man-child just beginning to learn about life itself. Both actors are superb in their roles and should be admired for continuing to take on challenging parts.The film is very well directed and presents well-written characters of which one truly cares. The Daniels (as they are billed) create a wonderful lyrical beauty in their film as the castaways philosophically debate life with all their insightful conversations. Particularly poetic is a lovely segment on a make-shift bus as Hank and Manny question the merits of love. The music score by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell blends beautifully with the visual look of the film and Matthew Hannam's editing sets the perfect lyrical tone.￼The mood of the film is slightly erratic, switching from silly comedy and slapstick while ending with an underlying pathos that is almost as schizophrenic as Hank's state of mind. Yet it works. That is until the film reaches its unsatisfying conclusion, one of those never-ending endings in which the viewer must decide the outcome. Instead of bringing together all the delightfully absurd surreal moments to a logical outcome, Swiss Army Man just adds more questions without any suitable answer.￼Still the film is loaded with imaginative ideas, unlike most films today. even if editing some of these concepts would have only enhanced the result. Granted, this movie is a hard sell from the start, as marketing proves. The overall audience has to have the same strange attraction to the subject and the average movie-going audience are not the target. The mix of quirky humor, raunchy subject, sophomoric sex jokes, and non-stop flatulence can wear one down. But there is enough originality and cleverness to mask the limits of this endeavor due to fine directing and top-notch performances by the two talented actors involved. Swiss Army Man remains sharp and just as versatile as its namesake. Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Swiss Army Man
41,framptonhollis,"somehow, they managed to make this movie really work!",9,30 January 2017,"I am absolutely blown away.Not only is this bizarre indie film about a farting corpse and a lonely, suicidal man stranded on an island one of the funniest films of last year, but it is also one of the most emotionally moving. A movie about a farting corpse is moving? I guess so.The fact that the directors managed to make this film work splendidly despite it having such an off the walls plot is highly impressive, but the fact that they also managed to make it a beautiful and thought provoking piece of art is an even greatest achievement. Sure, there's jokes about farts and boners and masturbating throughout, but there's also meaningful commentary on life and love-and it is all complicated by a fantastic soundtrack (made up almost entirely of human voices) and excellent performances by Paul Dano and especially Daniel Radcliffe, who turns his role a weird corpse into one of the most memorable, hilarious, and likable movie characters I've seen in a long time. After having experienced this film, I'm almost at a loss for words. It's really just a movie I'd recommend any readers to watch on their own, because there's no point in me just describing the film's memorable events and dialogue-one should really just see it for themselves. It's a brilliant film that deserves much more praise than it has gotten. I was not expecting any Best Picture nominees to be given to such a weird movie, but I cannot get over the fact that the Oscars just flat out ignored the movie in terms of original score, screenplay, and performances.Seriously, this is a brilliant, underrated, surreal, laugh out loud funny, and emotionally overwhelming masterpiece that must be seen by those who can embrace the weirdness.",Swiss Army Man
42,Kingslaay,Unique and Bizzarre,7,19 August 2018,"This movie is hard to describe, I would struggle to find a genre for it to fit in to. Besides being absolutely ridiculous, weird and beyond comprehension one is interested in the journey that unfolds. The story is told somewhat in an interesting fashion and the pace is good. The scenes and explanations given were out there. This is a very creative movie and it is hard to deconstruct what I saw but nevertheless interestingly entertaining. 7/10",Swiss Army Man
43,Matt_Layden,One Of The Best Films Of The Year!!!!,8,11 January 2017,"The most original film of the year and one of the more original films of the last decade. Swiss Army Man turned a lot of people away with the weird juvenile humour consisting of farts, but I feel like those people who turned it off or left the theatre missed out on something special. Behind all the gas, the film deals with depression, humanity and what it feels like to be alive. Poignant themes in a film that isn't a afraid to make you laugh in the weirdest way possible. Hank, played by Paul Dano, is marooned on an island and is literally about to hang himself when he sees a dead body wash ashore. He thinks nothing of it, until the body spasms and lets out numerous farts. The dead body, whom is later called Manny, played by Daniel Radcliffe, comes alive, more or less. He's able to have conversations, perform miraculous tasks and gives Hank the courage to look inside himself and answer some deep questions. This is my favourite Daniel Radcliffe performance, is that odd to say? He plays a corpse who farts, so he doesn't have to move around a lot and he is basically stone faced the whole film, yet he brings an innocent charm to the role. He questions what it means to be alive, what feeling of love hate and depression are. Hank tries his best to answer these questions, but he might not even know the answers himself. The two bond over a few ""Weekend At Bernie's"" style comedy bits, which have more meaning later on when more characters are introduced, specifically Mary Elizabeth Winstead. The title Swiss Army Man is appropriate as Radcliffe is used for various tasks. Fresh water pours out of his mouth, karate-chop action figure style arm swing, projectile mouth firing mechanism, sparking flint by snapping his fingers, among other things. Hank uses Manny's unique ""powers"" to help him traverse the terrain. You have to ask yourself, can you suspend enough of your imagination to enjoy the oddity of this? I don't think the film is ever really concerned with if any of these events are really happening or not. Instead it wants you to focus on the friendship these two have and despite one of them being dead, it's one of the best relationships depicted on screen this year. I know there are people out there who dislike the film, but count me in the camp of people who really responded to it. Who knew that film about a farting dead corpse would be one of the best of the year and one of the most honesty portrays of friendship. Swiss Army Man is a win and a watch for anyone wanting something unique in their movie going experience.",Swiss Army Man

45,brando647,Heart-Warming and Indescribably Strange Tale of a Man and a Corpse,6,11 September 2017,"If ever there was a movie that's difficult to recommend, or even describe, to someone who hasn't seen it, it's SWISS ARMY MAN. It's a comedy of sorts. You could probably even call it a romantic comedy. Or maybe it's more ""bromantic"" comedy. It's never made entirely clear what the relationship is between Paul Dano's Hank and the corpse he befriends (Daniel Radcliffe) when stranded on a diminutive island. Hank discovers the dead man, named Manny, when he washes ashore on the island where Hank's been surviving since whatever shipwreck left him there. Manny saves Hank's life; Hank was about to hang himself when Manny came along with his rocket-propelling flatulence. Hank is able to ride Manny like a jet ski back to the mainland. Little by little, Hank discovers there's more to Manny than one might believe. Aside from rocket flatulence, he's capable of vomiting up an apparent limitless reservoir of fresh water, directing them home with his dowsing rod erection, and hyper-powered karate chop action. Manny has essentially returned to pseudo-life, but he's still a corpse and he has no memory of anything from life. Right down to the basics. As Hank and Manny traverse the wilderness from the shore to civilization, Hank passes the time by explaining life and living, going so far as to build elaborate props so Manny can experience life himself. So if the premise of a miserable soul finding personal connection with a dead man with explosive gas sounds appealing, there you are.Obviously, SWISS ARMY MAN is a tough sell to the mainstream audience. The strange combination of the movie's juvenile humor with the heartfelt relationship at its core can be a rough watch for some. The movie kept bouncing between these two tones and I was generally annoyed with it. A sudden shift out of a touching moment of Manny rediscovering life with an erection joke cheapens the scene and lessens its impact (for me), and the reverse is just as aggravating because the stupid humor is the more entertaining part and I realize I would've been more content to watch an entire movie of Hank and Manny's adventures without, you know, the less interesting relationship element. The tonal shifts and the overly sappy life moments meant I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hope to. I was excited for this movie because an insane premise like that deserves a chance and, while I'd recommend anyone watch this movie and decide for themselves, it wouldn't be an enthusiastic recommendation. The performances give it a little extra something. Paul Dano is a great actor and kills it as the pathetic soul Hank as he finds someone who cares about him, even if that person is a corpse. Daniel Radcliffe must've been eager to reinforce that he'd moved on since Harry Potter because Manny is just about the strangest possible role he could've taken. And you know what? He's actually really, really good. Manny is the juicier role and he nails it.Dano and Radcliffe have a great chemistry, which is good since they are 95% of the movie until the last 5-10 minutes or so. This movie is very much two men wandering through the wilderness as one teaches the other about life and existence through the use of props and setpieces made from scraps and garbage. If nothing else, I can say SWISS ARMY MAN is the most creative film I've seen this year. I know it wasn't really the focus of the film and all but I would've loved a bit more explanation on what exactly the deal with Manny was. I started the movie believing him to be a manifestation of Hank's starved/sun-baked mind but he's able to interact with his environment and even speaks to one other person by the end. So if he's a real talking corpse, why hide his powers from everyone but Hank? And where does a talking corpse come from? Is he the only one? Am I over-thinking it? Yes. Because I was more interested in what Manny's deal was than the personal journey of these characters. I might not be the best person to give a recommendation on whether to watch this or not because obviously I walked away from it with a complete different focus than what was intended by the filmmakers. Something tells me this movie is going to be polarizing though. My friend complained when I made him watch MOON; I can only imagine the crap I'd get for this one.",Swiss Army Man
46,bkrauser-81-311064,Stupifyingly Unique,9,4 July 2016,"Um, huh. I, umm huh. This may be one of the hardest reviews I will ever have to write. There's nothing that can be said about Swiss Army Man that hasn't already been said. Is it the long-lost, constantly flatulent cousin of Weekend at Bernie's (1989)? Yes. Is it a demented and contrived film that revels defiantly in its own quirkiness? Check. Is the film bizarre, ludicrous and stupifyingly unique? You betcha. Yet despite its polarizing Sundance premiere and it having been unfortunately dubbed "" the farting corpse"", there's no denying that Swiss Army Man is an emotional roller coaster and splendidly original sight to behold.Seriously, Swiss Army Man may have a one-up on this movie The film begins with the desperate Hank (Dano) standing on a small island somewhere in the north Pacific. What we can cobble together from context clues, Hank seems to have survived there for quite some time. He sports a scruffy beard, stands atop a cooler and is about ready to end it all. In enters Manny (Radcliffe) a blue suit sporting dead body who washed up on the shores of Hank's deserted island. Hank tries to resuscitate him but all he can conjure is a curious and consistent case of bad gas. Seeing Manny as a source for salvation, the unlikely duo try to find civilization in one of the most surreal journeys to be dedicated to the screen since El Topo (1970).The relationship between Hank and Manny sits as a surprisingly earnest friendship that rivals some of the classic double acts (think Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis), right down to the inclusion of song. They bond over childlike ruminations of how and what things are in the real world, while arguing the validity of Hanks repressed memories and fantasies. Manny's appearance in Hank's life is quite lifesaving in more ways than one, offering a fools perspective on Hank's predicament. This is in addition to all the things Manny does in the trailer, i.e. shooting projectiles from his mouth, cutting wood with karate chop action and farting through the water like a foul-smelling jet ski.What really sets the film apart is its ability to break down its themes in creative, new and occasionally frustrating ways. Just when you think you know where Swiss Army Man is going, it pulls the rug out from under you. The movie melts into a hallucinogenic hipster inspired fever dream. One minute our protagonist is fighting for his survival, the next moment there are Michel Gondry-esque fantasy sequences that emphasize tactility over whimsy.Likewise the humor interjects itself in unexpected moments often undercutting some of the film's gravest moments. While in any other movie, this kind of glibness would crimp the narrative, with Swiss Army Man it not only enhances the film's themes but proves a check on the film's more intellectually preening sensibilities. The emotional and the intellectual build off each other in this film like a game of slap hands. Ultimately however, the film settles on an impressionistic tone that channels Terrence Malick through conduits as unlikely as the Farrelly Brothers.The film then diverges into psychological drama before letting the audience decide what the hell happened. Where you fall on the ending feels almost like a litmus test. Do you stare at the existential void and shudder? Could Manny be a symbol of faith? Is a victory in your mind still a victory? How do you treat people? How should you treat people? Your answers to these questions should inform how you view the film and help you decide if the ending resembles the midriff of Badlands (1973) or the end of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). I myself am still thinking about it; beaming, slightly teary-eyed and more than a little gassy while doing so.",Swiss Army Man
47,sme_no_densetsu,"Well, it's definitely unique",7,23 October 2018,"I feel pretty confident in saying that ""Swiss Army Man"" has a premise that you haven't seen in any other movie. In this day and age, that's saying something in and of itself. Whether that's enough to carry an entire movie is another story.The premise here is that a lonely & hopeless man stranded on a deserted island more or less befriends a corpse that washes up on shore. While trying to make their way back to civilization the two bond. The living guy teaches the dead one about life and the dead guy functions as sort of a human version of a Swiss Army knife. To say that the premise is off the wall is an understatement. Yet, there does seem to be a metaphorical underpinning to this relationship, though it's one that you'll have to infer for yourself since the filmmakers don't dwell on it. Of course, it's possible that it could all just be pure fantasy with little deeper meaning, though I doubt it.Considering that almost all of the movie's runtime is focused on just two individuals, this is a movie that demands a lot from its actors. Paul Dano especially, since his character is actually alive. You might think that Daniel Radcliffe would have limited opportunities for expression since he plays a corpse but the role is more interesting than you might think. Strange as it may sound, Dano & Radcliffe actually have good chemistry together and you buy into their friendship as a result. The rest of the small cast is mostly undistinguished, though it does include Mary Elizabeth Winstead in a small but pivotal role.Stylistically, the movie is nicely done, though it does have its eccentricities. Mostly, it's quirky in roughly the same way that other so-called 'quirky' movies are quirky. The music reflects this and just the general visual style (cinematography, editing, etc...). It's arguably a case of style over substance, though I do think that there is some substance at the bottom of this movie if you care to give some thought to what you're watching.While I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend this movie it's definitely worth watching for someone who thinks they've seen it all. Even then, their reaction could just as easily be to hate it rather than love it. Personally, I think that the meaning of the story might be a bit too obscure for most viewers (at least as far as I've interpreted it) but it's told with enough panache to save the movie from being weird without being entertaining.",Swiss Army Man
48,Screen_Blitz,"Profoundly bizarre, philosophical fantasy adventure has some substance but perhaps is a little clumsy for it's own good",6,19 March 2017,"This part-buddy comedy, part-fantasy adventure is one of those rare cinematic entries that is destined to leave moviegoers with the question ""what kind of drugs were these filmmakers on?"". It is a movie that is astoundingly original and almost entirely divorced to the typical cinematic conventions of any genre. In other words, it almost feels like a large smorgasbord of nearly every genre mixed together. Pushing the boundaries of absurdity and gross-out humor, this movie homes a story of a friendship that is profoundly easy to call ""unlike anything we've seen before"", and this is not an exaggeration. How can a young man form a relationship with a dead body without it coming as horrifying or just plain creepy? This question is answered in this absurd adventure orchestrated by directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert in their feature film debut. This film follows Hank (played by Paul Dano), a scruffy young man stranded on island for reasons never fully explained. When all hope seems lost, Hank ties a rope around his in attempt to commit suicide. He is soon stopped by the sight of a corpse (played by Daniel Radcliffe) washed up on shore. The corpse begins flatulating like crazy. Upon interacting with this discolored dead body, Hank discovers that the body has special powers including one that allows Hank to ride him across the sea like a jet ski with his flatulence propelling him. As he forms a bond with the body, the blooming friendship slowly regenerates the body to life. What transpires is a quest to return to civilization.Yes! This movie is far more peculiar than it sounds, and it is powerfully aware of how deeply bizarre it is. But beneath the abundance amount of fart jokes and envelop-pushing gross-out humor involving sex and masturbation is a surprisingly thoughtful journey about human emotions and the uncompromising power of friendship. The central figure of the story is the friendship between a young man and a dead man who gradually awakens from the grave, questioning various aspects of life and death. With the topics of conversations ranging from why are people embarrassed of farting in front of others, to why sexual intercourse fun, to what is love; the characters' bond transpires to a plethora of vastly awkward, yet hilarious conversations with dialogue that normally comes off as vile and off-putting in most movies. Here, the dialogue translates into something thoughtful, a valuable message about being afraid of other judging you for being different. The humor however, can occasionally falls flat and at times, veers into areas to absurd even for the already bizarre content (one of the story elements involves an erection). The movie hammers on plenty of material that can make some deeply uncomfortable or even appalled. Beneath it all is a little, but clumsily addressed philosophy about how people must learn to function in society regardless of how weird they are. As the two learn, everybody is strange in one way or another.The central cast of the unusual picture is limited to the likes of Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. Dano who's been met with spectacular acclaim for his role in the Oscar-winning historical drama '12 Years A Slave' and the critically praised biopic 'Love & Mercy', cashes in a clean-cut performance is that the lead character trying to find love and hope in a world inhabited with nobody but an unusual corpse with mysterious powers. Working on his side is Daniel Radcliffe. With his days as Harry Potter half-a-decade in the rearview mirror, Radcliffe has explored roles in many areas of the cinematic realm, but none nearly as original and uncanny as this one. Embarking on screen as a dead body lying the on the beach with his eyes half open and skin discolored, his character involves into a live human being which allows him to invest in a potent, yet bizarre performance as an abnormal man with powers that only be described as one-of-a-kind. It is a role that allows him to expand upon his range of humor and human drama. These two play off each other in a series of off-putting dialogue and humor sometimes to weird to describe. The duo of performances come together to form a friendship that is a little clumsily to handle in some areas (especially with the eccentric sense of humor), but preserves a lively sense of love and hope that some can admire. That is if they can move past the quirkiness and the idiosyncratic soundtrack by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell.Swiss Army Man is a considerably entertaining adventure that pushes the envelope of cinematic absurdity in a way that is moderately smart, while falling victim to slightly clumsy execution. Pervasively weird in every turn, this is a movie that will understandably put off some viewers, but at the same time leave others inspired. Those who are able to buy into the eccentric material and occasional vulgarity are the most likely to find the gold in this cinematic entry.",Swiss Army Man

55,dave-mcclain,"""Swiss Army Man"" is like a rusted version of the tool mentioned in its title - potentially multi-purpose, but basically useless.",1,11 July 2016,"According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, the word ""weird"" means ""very strange and unusual, unexpected, or not natural"". However, most people use the word as a way to demean and dismiss anything that they don't agree with, understand or are not a part of, the implication being something like ""everything that I do, say and think is normal, but everything different from that is just weird."" In short, the proper use of ""weird"" is for things ranging from the unusual to the unnatural, but things that are simply different from a given individual's experience don't quite qualify. Now, having made that distinction, I'm here to tell you that ""Swiss Army Man"" (R, 1:37) fits any and every definition of ""weird"".Hank (Paul Dano) has somehow become shipwrecked on some isolated beach and doesn't seem to have any idea where he is. We don't know how long he has been there, but when we first see him, he is in such a state of extreme despair that he is preparing to hang himself. But before he gets a chance to do his death dance, he spots someone else washed up on the shore. He runs to see if the person is still alive. He's not. Well, he's unresponsive anyway until he starts farting. In fact, this corpse farts so much and with such force that Hank can ride the corpse like a jet ski to another nearby beach. No kidding.Even though Hank still doesn't know where he is, he credits the corpse with saving his life (at least for the time being), so he drags the flatulent fellow to shelter. The two of them spend the night in a cave, as it rains outside. Hank finds a cup and tries to catch rain water with it, but the cup has a hole in it. The corpse's mouth, which has been agape all night, has also caught some of the rain water. In the morning, Hank discovers that pressing on the corpse's belly makes that water gush from its mouth. Hank drinks.Then the corpse begins to speak! It's only mumbling at first, but then the words becoming clearer and Hank begins conversing with the corpse, whom he calls Manny (and is played by Daniel Radcliff). Manny talks while staring off into space and he doesn't seem to understand more than a small child, so most of these conversations involve Hank trying to answer Manny's simple questions and trying to teach Manny about life. The two of them talk about things like farting, pooping, families, women and masturbation.Manny can't walk, so Hank alternately straps Manny to his back and drags Manny on a stretcher, as Hank keeps the two of them moving forward in an attempt to find someone who can help them. Soon, Hank learns that Manny can do more than spew drinking water from his mouth and propel the two of them through the water (and even into the air) with his farts. Manny can chop wood with his hand, cut rope with his teeth and can even shoot things out of his mouth with enough force to kill forest creatures that can then be cooked and eaten. Like the time-honored multi-purpose tool of the film's name, Manny has many potentially life-saving uses. Oh, and when he sees a picture of a woman, he gets an erection which stretches out his pants and points the way towards somewhere, and Hank wants to go there.""Swiss Army Man"" is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen, and not in a good way. I appreciate creativity and originality in movies and I do my best to respect a given filmmaker's vision, even if it's not my style, but this movie is unnecessarily bizarre. Still, there is a point to this film's strangeness. It's about friendship, accepting yourself for who you are, appreciating all aspects of life, yada, yada, yada. These are all great messages, but we've seen them portrayed many times before in movies that were original, but more entertaining and definitely less crude and less odd. This movie deserves points for creativity and some positive messages, but it's just too damned weird for me to recommend it. ""D""",Swiss Army Man
56,swilliky,Comedic but not as deep as it wants to be,5,12 July 2016,"The comedic indie film about farts and a powerful dead body comes from the Daniels, the pair of writer/directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinart. The movie follows Hank Johnson (Paul Dano) trapped on an island prepared to end his life by hanging when he spots a dead body rolling up out of the waves. Hank decides to live and investigate the body with plenty of funny physical comedy.The body turns out to be Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) whose powerful farts propel him through the ocean so that Hank can ride him like a jet ski. The special effects were pretty good and added a lot to the bumbling dead body of Radcliffe's Manny. What really brings the movie alive is when Manny starts to talk and ask questions of Hank who struggles to explain the complexities of life.Using Manny's remarkable abilities, Hank attempts to return home but as we learn more about Hank, there are reasons he may not want to return home to his dull, sad life. Manny is curious and excited about life becoming very curious about women, especially the woman Sara (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) pictured on Hank's dying phone.

58,silvermistvio,Spending time with a dead body. That's a different story.,7,19 May 2019,"Swiss Army Man is kind of very difficult to review. Normally, I find it's very difficult to review on the films which are going with the steady plot. I mean which have no exciting scenes, something like that. Swiss Army Man is one of those kinds of films.I like the fact that the leading character, Hank, has to spend time with a dead body, Manny to get rid of boredom because there's no one with him. That's pitiful. It's not an easy thing to do because it makes you seem that you're a crazy person. I mean talking to yourself really makes a crazy person. But he doesn't have a choice but to do like that.What I like of this film is how they spend time together. Even it's a dead body, but it seems like he's having fun with another living person. Those scenes are so much fun. I really love those scenes and they make me feel warm.Daniel Radcliffe's dead body face expression is so funny. Because of it, I feel like this film gets better and better. The whole time, he really looks like a dead body. I mean he does have any movement on his face or the whole body. It might be very hard to act.All in all, Swiss Army Man is something different from which I've seen. The story is very simple but it has so much fun. Although the concept of dead body makes me disgusting but in time, it gives me fun and thus, this film is kind of worth watching.",Swiss Army Man
59,bryank-04844,'Swiss Army Man' Has Everything you want.,10,23 January 2017,"There are only a few times a year where a movie completely catches you off guard and there are fewer times where a movie will be imprinted and branded into your mind forever. 'Swiss Army Man' is one of those films. It's funny, disgusting, beautiful, and simply amazing on just about every level. This is where cinema is at its best. Director and writer pair Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (known as the Daniels) have masterfully crafted a screenplay and beautifully shot film that that covers just about every aspect of being alive and human. It's almost a coming-of-age story in a weird sort of way and is full of pure, amazing life, even though there is a corpse throughout the entire film. This movie takes those small, precious, awkward moments in life and puts them flat on the table for everyone to see. It's a little bit gross and weird, but it's also amazing and beautiful. I don't think any two people could have played the two parts any better than Paul Dano or Daniel Radcliffe did. They are simply phenomenal in their roles and bring such a heartfelt performance to each of their characters, that you can't help but want to spend more time with them.We first meet Hank (Dano) who is on a small deserted island, as he is about to hang himself with makeshift rope, when he suddenly sees a dead body on the shore (Radcliffe). After he slips and almost hangs himself to death, he walks over to the corpse only to find out that the corpse has a ton of gas still inside of it. Soon enough, Dano is riding this farting corpse like a jet ski to a bigger place where civilization might be. Hank brings the corpse with him as he tries to find help and home and figures out that this dead body has a lot of cool powers and uses, like chopping down trees, spewing up rain water, farting fire, and shooting things at super speed out of its mouth.The body soon begins to talk as Hank props this corpses head up and pokes and prods him to get him to do things. The corpse goes by Manny and is just as innocent as a newborn. Manny is discovering life and has no idea what it's like, so Hank answers all questions from jerking off, to riding a bus, to going on a date and listening to music, to watching movies and having parents, and even re-writing the childhood classic ""Everybody Poops"" with actual poop inside the pages of the bible. No matter what you may feel about this movie, there will be something good you will take away with it, whether it be friendship, love, accepting yourself and others, happiness, or just a farting corpse that smiles. It's all here and on display in the most beautiful fashion.Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are incredible in these characters. Dano plays Hank with such charisma and charm, yet with a chaotic and scary side, that you are never too sure about him. You can love him one minute and be frightened of him the next. Hank has many layers to him and Dano executes each emotional layer flawlessly. Then there is Daniel Radcliffe, who might just deserve a Best Actor nomination at the Oscars this year for his role as a corpse. Even though Manny is supposed to be dead and gross, Radcliffe plays him with so much life, that he is, well – alive. I've never quite seen anything like it before.The two Daniels have really broken the mold with 'Swiss Army Man' and I'm sure this film will be etched into the minds of cinema lovers for years to come. The soundtrack is also fantastic by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell and has a fantastical and indie element about it. This is one of the most original and fun movies of the year.",Swiss Army Man
60,msbreviews,Rating: A-,9,6 August 2017,"I'm not going to hold it in any longer, I loved this film! It's extremely well directed, super original, DIFFERENT and WEIRD. It has an amazing score that makes every scene so much better and a team of actors with their best performances so far. The directors constantly used childish and embarrassing things to talk about in public (farting, masturbation, etc) as metaphors to some of the most profound life lessons that I've ever heard.There are so many scenes that I'll remember for a long time because they were so deep and true: there are a couple of scenes where Manny, who lost his memories and wanted to learn everything about life, asks Hank, who's partially using and deceiving Manny in order to return home,  why he wants to go back if they can't do anything? Why would he go back home if he has to hold in his farts and can't say what he wants to say? Because, in our world, that's rude, obscene ... And also a lie. This film points out so many moments of our lives that, when we think about it, they're so true that we don't even realize how often we do them. If I had to rate this movie in terms of inspiration and life motivation scenes, I give it an A+ straight away.Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano have their best performances ever. The Harry Potter movies' kid is amazing and Dano is at the same level. They're hilarious and that's something I almost forgot to say: this movie is FUNNY! The humor is extremely good and there are so many scenes that just let me in tears of so much laughing. They transformed what could've been a B drama (and even boring) movie into a captivating film filled with life stories that we can all relate to.The end of the movie doesn't really make sense to me and that's really my only main complaint about this film. Analyzing the movie from the beginning, as I put the pieces of the puzzle together, the ending doesn't appear to fit in with the rest of the story. I can understand what the directors were going for, but unfortunately, I don't think they were able to do it perfectly.Still, Swiss Army Man wins the award for the Weirdest Movie of the Year with an astounding team of directors, actors and an epic score that I'm not going to forget that fast!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Swiss Army Man

65,davidgee,Dead man talking,8,7 October 2016,"My first movie in a month and I could hardly have picked anything more weird! Paul Dano plays Hank, marooned on a desert island like Robinson Crusoe. His Man Friday is Manny (Daniel Radcliffe), a washed-up corpse whose spectacular flatulence propels Hank into an amazing odyssey. Despite being dead Manny has other gifts – for starters, he can talk - and he's a great listener. An unlikely friendship bonds the two of them together as they trek and scavenge their way back to civilisation. Hank has a major crush on a girl he's seen on his daily commute and she has a role to play in their bizarre adventure.As 'bromances' go, this is at the far extreme of bizarre. Monty Python meets American Pie, with too many fart and 'stiffie' gags. Paul Dano's Hank is the apotheosis of nerdiness (I thought him horribly miscast in the recent TV version of War and Peace), but he manages to become endearing to the viewer as well as to Manny. Daniel Radcliffe has charm and a fair degree of charisma, even when playing a flatulent corpse; it's safe to say he has laid Harry Potter to rest.Writer/directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have concocted a movie so far out that it makes the Coen brothers look mainstream. It will not be to everyone's taste, but a film starring a farting corpse is oddly beguiling.",Swiss Army Man
66,PyroSikTh,Interesting Concept Ruined by Incessant Fart Jokes,6,7 October 2016,"This is a movie who's concept sounds awful on paper; A man stranded on an island befriends a corpse with magical powers that washes up on the beach and they try to find their way back to civilisation together. And yet the trailer held the promise of something much deeper under the inherent silliness. Nevertheless, while I was prepared for a bizarre outing, Swiss Army Man turned out to be even weirder than I expected. Even after having slept on it, I'm still not sure what to make of it.The bulk of the movie is Hank, a lonely, suicidal man, stranded away from civilisation, travelling through a forest with a dead body guiding the way. The body seems to supply Hank with everything he needs, like projectile spit for water, or the ability to shoot harpoons from his mouth. In return, Hank teaches Manny, the corpse, all about love, life, and what is socially acceptable (pro-tip, it's not farting or erections). It comes to light that Hank has a crush for a girl he saw on the bus, who he has become somewhat fixated with, and so Manny by extension becomes fixated with as well, and they roleplay various scenarios that never happened.Swiss Army Man is labelled as a comedy, so there are jokes, and it is reasonably light-hearted. Unfortunately, bar a few choice moments, the humour did absolutely nothing for me. In fact I would go so far as to say it kind of ruined the experience for me. The humour in Swiss Army Man isn't just crude, it's juvenile. Crude humour I can deal with, but juvenile humour is just not my dish. The biggest running joke of the whole movie is that Manny farts a lot. He's a dead body full of decomposition gases, of course he farts a lot. But you know, farting is funny so that makes this a comedy right? Erections as well, Manny gets erections when he looks at pictures of half-naked women, and that's funny too, obviously.Thing is, while this juvenile humour took me out of the movie completely, and is not my kind of humour at all, I can at least understand it's reasoning. Half the movie's message is about what is and isn't socially acceptable. Farting and getting an erection in public are generally considered big taboos, but the movie's point is why? They're natural processes of the human body and shouldn't be ashamed of. Everyone farts. Everyone poops. Everyone masturbates. If everyone does it, why is everyone so worried about other people knowing it? As movie messages go, it's a fairly unique one to approach.The acting is pretty top-notch across the board though. Paul Dano does what he does best as the nerdy, shy Hank. He shows a real turmoil, and his conversations with a dead body are so natural. For me though, the star of the show is Daniel Radcliffe who once again goes out of his way to separate himself from the Harry Potter image. His dead body impression is the most accurate I've seen. They had a dummy available, but he insisted on doing most of it himself, and it shows. His floppiness is unmatched, and his ability to move his body in unnatural ways and resist any kind of flinching is really impressive. On the more emotional side though, he shows a fantastic sense of innocence and curiosity that obviously mirrors Hank's own psyche.The last thing I'll note is the soundtrack, which is almost entirely acapella. It's spurned on by the two characters themselves, layered up from sounds they make and notes they hum and harmonise together. There's one moment in particular that uses a full acapella version of the Jurassic Park theme, and that alone almost makes the movie worth watching.I'm still not sure what to make of Swiss Army Man. It has it's good moments and it's bad moments. Fundamentally it is simply one of the most unique and original movies on the market. The Daniels' ability to take what sounds like such a god-awful concept and work it into something that's almost deep and moving is impressive. It's biggest sin is that it simply doesn't make a whole load of sense and makes no effort to try and explain anything, instead opting to offer opposing clues to cement different interpretations, making any interpretation null and void. Was it a story about a man and his dead body finding their way back home, or was it a story about a man and his dead body obsessing over a girl they don't know and being driven mad by loneliness? Even now I'm left clueless. It was a find movie of self-discovery right up until the third act when it just stopped making any kind of sense at all. I give Swiss Army Man a conflicted 6/10.",Swiss Army Man
67,jordan2240,Perhaps I'm too stupid for this film,3,22 May 2017,"Only made it through about 40 minutes (on Amazon Prime), then turned on something else. Didn't find it particularly funny (sorry, the farting was way overplayed, as was the dancing penis), and couldn't figure out if things were supposed to be happening as depicted or if they were in the mind of Dano's character. Got too bored to care after the aforementioned 40 minutes. I like some weird stuff, but this wasn't suited to my taste at all. Sometimes I'll re-watch a movie and find that I simply wasn't in the mood for it the first time, but this isn't one I'd be willing to give another chance.",Swiss Army Man
68,MattBrady099,Swiss Army Man - Movie Review,8,26 September 2016,"""If my best friend hides his farts from me then what else is he hiding from me, and why does that make me feel so alone?""Never would I expect a farting talking corpse would've turn out to be a good movie. Even on paper, this idea sounds awful, but it's one of those things that manages to work out. I always hear people complain that movies just ain't that original anymore, with the endless reboots and the unnecessary squeals. And then you get something like this that's so different. Something so bizarre, weird and original that it's executed in a way that it actually works as a movie.There's something deeply beautiful and very relatable about ""Swiss Army Man"" that I know a lot of people won't agree. It isn't for everybody. I mean, just look at the reviews for Sundance and the reports of walk outs during the movie. But then again, what do they know.Daniel Scheinert & Daniel Kwan bring a sweet and a very surreal study of the human condition that's done so uniquely. Making farts jokes seem so poetic.This is Daniel Radcliffe at his best and while he's character may be dead, there's still heart within him. Paul Dano who really has been impressing me over the past years is really great in this. Radcliffe and Dano brought a sense of friendship and a real chemistry that after awhile it kinda over shadows the wackiness of whats going on. Some people may find the scenes between them too disturbing or creepy, and I can totally understand that. But it's something that's hard to explain really. Even if you try to put together why something like this worked, but it never fully clicks in your head as the correct answer. Well, what can I say. Movies make you feel something man. Overall rating: I'm no gonna lie, I teared up a bit while watching this. Yes, a farting corpse movie actually made laugh, cry and think differently on things. WOW.",Swiss Army Man

70,CineMuseFilms,echoes the classic absurdism of Waiting for Godot and the rich fantasy of Prospero's Books,8,17 July 2016,"How can a film be defiant? After all, to defy audiences or cinema itself would be self-defeating. But there are many ways film can defy us. For example, it can ignore the basic logic of storytelling and blur the boundaries of reality and fantasy. Or it can boldly go into places where polite people don't tread and then step back and laugh at us for following it. This is what Swiss Army Man (2016) does, and the best way to experience it is like an extended poem or a meditation, enjoy its rich metaphors and figurative layers of meaning, and savour its defiance of conventional logic.If this sounds challenging, at least the plot line is simple. Marooned on a deserted island, Hank (Paul Dano) is about to hang himself when he notices a body washed up on the beach. He befriends the soon un-dead corpse he names Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) and uses its strange powers to navigate back to civilisation. Defying all logic, Manny is able to produce enough high-velocity flatulence to power a jet-ski and fire projectiles at marauding bears and other wildlife. This absurdist scatological comedy shows them navigating out of the wilderness guided by Manny's penile compass while having ongoing conversations that dwell heavily on male sexual functions. Totally normal, you might say, for a film focused on two young men. The real substance of this film is not the crazy happenings but in the dialogue and relationship between two lost souls. Like a deliberately ambivalent poem or painting, the film can be interpreted in so many ways and what you bring to it shapes its meaning. The more obvious themes relate to nature's beauty compared to the artifice of civilisation, human-caused environmental degradation, the existential irrelevance of manners and the value of love and friendship in sustaining life. Look closely and you will find a film that echoes the classic absurdism of Waiting for Godot and the rich fantasy of Prospero's Books.From a technical point of view, there is little to say about a film that defies logic and has multiple endings that make no more sense than the surreal journey. The acting is engaging and often touching, although caricatured, and the acapella soundtrack is eerie but effective in sustaining the film's weirdness. It is not for everyone and those grossed-out enough to leave early are missing one of the most original films of the last decade. Ignore what you read. Just see it, feel it, and take time to think about what it means to you.",Swiss Army Man
71,in1984,A Comedy of Fears - and Crazy,5,3 July 2016,"6.5 of 10. Whereas we frequently get comedies of errors, and this certainly has that, this is primarily making comedy out of fearful and even horrific situations. I imagine this will be a favorite among social workers and psychologists.Besides the frequently referenced farting and massive piles of bear poop, this treads in a lot of areas people would prefer not to talk or think about - not just because they are gross. The highly unusual if not unique element is the fear and crazy combined into humor. I can't think of anything that's not psycho horror that combines the elements of this film into something intriguing to watch.Unfortunately, there are more than a few clichés and well worn melodrama for losers that hurt the originality of the story, plus some unexplained shifts in clothing/appearance that take away from the immersion.Not a theater film, but worth seeing, secretly with your stuffed raccoon, or with your friends and biggest bear.",Swiss Army Man
72,coreyjdenford,Parping gold,10,30 September 2016,"This is my review of Swiss Army Man (spoiler free)***** (5/5)CINEMA RARELY HOLDS some inventive moments that are both weirdly wonderful and cheerfully silly but look no further as writer/director duo Dan Kwan and Daniel Sheinert simply known as the Daniels, unveil in Swiss Army Man. Which at first glance could be seen as the dumbest movie ever about a man who is deserted on an island finds a decomposing corpse on the beach as he is about to hang himself because he has no need for life, but as the film rolls on it's actually very, very clever, tremendously funny but naturally grotesque at the same time. It's a beautiful story of life and death set in a gorgeous idyllic utopia surrounded by seamlessly never-ending woodland. Although the theatrical life of Swiss Army Man wasn't exactly a great start to what could be a hot ticket to the 2017 Oscar season, we shall see. In the early weeks of 2016 at Sundance Film Festival, it was booed by multiple audiences across the United States and audiences were calling it the worst and dumbest movie ever, however the negativity was short-lived as the weeks and months rolled on it started getting a high amount of praise, and was even awarded the Sundance directing award for best directors, and was called one of the best yet weirdest movies ever made.This could be seen as an apt collaboration between Weekend at Bernie's and Cast Away but what if Weekend at Bernie's was to conclude with Bernie coming back to life? If Cast Away concluded with Chuck dying on that deserted island? Just something to think about. This is a weird hybrid of drama and comedy and musical (as played by the gorgeous original score by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell just in case you wanted to know) that's a bit grotesque and silly, but by the end this could be a life lesson as Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) the decomposing corpse with mystical powers shows that flatulence isn't so much a bad thing, this is the lesson that he teaches to Hank (Paul Dano) who's very discreet about his bodily functions. The start of this movie is both funny and stunning as Hank sees the corpse and he seeks the help of the decaying body he learns that Manny is the name that Hank gives him can communicate by farting but he doesn't like that idea, and as the body is about to wave away, he also sees that the farts have some kind of propulsion power and he thinks this could be the answer to his survival essentially the scene ends with a farting body jet ski, weird right? In case you were wondering about the amount of fart based laughs there are; the answer is an absolute ton. It shows at first that, that is all this has to offer but as the pair go on a surreal journey to find civilization Hank discovers more powers that Manny seems to have, spitting like a fountain which Hank uses as a refreshing water dispenser, he can fell trees, can shoot rock pellets from his mouth and has an erection that is used as a GPS which Hank uses to find civilization. Not only that but Hank becomes friends with Manny and starts to teach him about life as Manny seems to have forgotten how wonderful and challenging and really how sad life can be, take our word for it; but Daniel Radcliffe plays a very convincing corpse, and this is easily his best performance so far. As the film goes on and through the middle it involves a wooden bus, humming and a photo of a woman named Sarah (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Dano cross dressing which looks very convincing, but as Manny is learning about Hank's life when he shows to be kind of cowardly in his life before the island this is a very advantageous montage surrounded by a beautiful score and is just wonderful to behold and to see Manny progress in the world of dating, and learns how to really talk to someone he has a strong infatuation for at this point he begins to get obsessed with a woman he has never met.There is also an awkward talk about masturbation which could be the rudest scene but also the most complex as Manny learns about when to masturbate and who should do it mainly himself, but Hank gets embarrassed as Manny starts to talk about masturbation with his mother, this is a weird scene but still manages to be quite powerful and nonetheless awkward. The finale involves an exploding fart, a bear and meeting the woman in real life but he sees that life can be very heartbreaking as he learns about the real Sarah. Despite all the silliness, the high amount of grotesque fart jokes, erection acting like a GPS to find civilization or even the fact that Manny can fell trees with a karate chop. The whole idea of it should not work, but it does and it's a beautiful story about life and death that's just wonderful and this is a film love it or hate it that should be cherished and remembered and could even go down in history as a cult classic. VERDICT: Swiss Army Man is weird, inventive and tremendously funny. A bit silly in parts but in its core is a very clever and moving comedy/drama, buoyed by phenomenal performances; in fact, it's parping gold. 10/10 strong, powerful, moving and terrifically funny.",Swiss Army Man

We have the story of Hank (Paul Dano), who is lost on an island and meets a strange being with absurd powers that help him escape and get to know each other. Paul Dano is incredible in this film, a sensational performance, and Daniel Scheinert made the best dead half I saw in the cinema, with soundtracks and good and practical photographs, nothing is left to be desired, an edition and impeccable montages, but here the strong point Is still the script, which at one point gives itself to the common and cliché, but only for a moment, then it recovers, at least and parts, the construction of our protagonist is confused, as every first act of the film.

74,Ramascreen,The best movie of 2016,10,25 June 2016,"When you look up the word 'original' in your dictionary, you might find a poster of SWISS ARMY MAN next to the definition. This is simply the best movie of 2016 in my book. It's outrageous, it's visionary, it's full of humor and heart. To those of you who often complain that there's nothing original to watch in theaters anymore, writing/directing team Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert have come to the rescue.Paul Dano plays Hank, stranded on a deserted island, about to commit suicide because to him, all hope is lost. And suddenly he sees a corpse named Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) who changes everything. Hank is determined to use his new multipurpose friend to go on an epic adventure that Hank hopes would bring him back to the woman of his dreams.Brought to you by the guys behind ""Turn Down For What"" video, SWISS ARMY MAN is what happens when you let filmmakers run wild with their active imagination. It's a story about a man scared to take chances on love and life until a dead man who farts a lot has to show him how much fun letting loose and taking chances can be despite the outcome. Writing/directing team, simply known as DANIELS, pack this film with all kinds of surprises, like one of those nesting dolls, just when you thought you've seen what Manny can do, he can do another thing and another and it doesn't stop. And I'd like to see it as DANIELS channeling their limitless creativity through Dano's character, Hank, because Hank is the one who's got the skills to utilize Manny in order to create something that's either fun or simply useful.Never have I seen a movie that celebrates farting as much as this. Some might dismiss SWISS ARMY MAN as absurd but this film wears absurdity proudly like a badge of honor. And to me the fart jokes and the corpse jokes, the erection jokes, they even have Jurassic Park jokes, are all just the vehicle that drives this friendship story. You have one character who's dead inside, and one character who's literally dead, interacting in a way that looks insane to some, but DANIELS crafted in a way that makes Hank and the audiences feel hopeful at the end. So this ain't some kind of ""Weekend At Bernie's"" long lost cousin. Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe fully immerse themselves in DANIELS' vision, although I'm sure at first they may have had trouble imagining what they read on the script. But the commitment of those two actors is evident on screen, they don't hold back. Accompanied by fantastic and super catchy score/soundtrack, SWISS ARMY MAN is a cinematic celebration that you can't get enough of. Bound to be a favorite to many; bound to be an instant classic.-- Rama's Screen --",Swiss Army Man

76,gavinp9,"Unique, mostly fun, look at friendship",7,2 January 2018,"An odd mix of 'Cast Away' and 'Weekend At Bernie's', 'Swiss Army Man' is better than both those films, thanks to it's unique look at life, friendship and loneliness - as well as the fact that it has two great actors fully committed to their characters. Hank (Dano) is stranded on an island when he finds Manny (Radcliffe), a corpse washed up on the beach. The excessively flatulent body helps him get back to the mainland (somewhere in Washington, Oregon, or northern California) - a great opening 10min. Still lost and starving in the wilderness, this is when Hank figures out that Manny can speak - and the whimsy begins! The next 20min are a little slow as Hank has to explain everything to Manny (including 'Jurassic Park'!), but then the adventure begins.Once they're on the move, the editing is pacier, the scenery looks great, the things Hank makes are wonderful and there's some true laugh out loud moments. The absurdity of it all is quickly forgotten, as Hank discovers Manny's ""superpowers"" and there's a great montage and some great stunts by Radcliffe. The dialogue between the two is fun, with Manny getting to almost learn like a child and ask inappropriate questions. You almost forget the character's dead, until they do something, like flop his head, to remind you he's a talking cadaver!One thing that keeps the film light and fun is the score by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell, which uses no lyrics, just amazing harmonies (do's, ah's, ba's, la's) all layered on top of each other - usually starting from something Hank or Manny says. Quite inventive and it suits perfectly. The ending is done quite well, with their return from the bush, but you truly feel you've been on a journey with them and feel their friendship. For a directorial debut, the Daniels have done a great job - I look forward to what's next!",Swiss Army Man
77,Rendanlovell,"Full of heart, style, and incredibly original.",8,2 July 2016,"This is one movie that is very difficult to explain. The main premise is that a man is stranded on an island. As he is about to hang himself, he sees the corpse of Daniel Radcliffe wash up on the beach. Quickly after freeing himself he finds that this dead body may not be fully dead. He finds this out by the ""corpse"" ripping a massive fart. So massive in fact, that it sends him skipping through the water like a jetski. Of course, Hank (Dano) sees this as an unlikely opportunity to escape his island prison. The more time he spends with this corpse the more Hank realizes that this person has remarkable abilities. Abilities that he uses to get back home.The reason this films title is the 'Swiss Army Man' is because he is basically a Swiss army knife of sorts. His farts are flammable, his arm can be used like an axe, his fingers snap to produce sparks, and so on. If you've never heard of a movie like this that's because there isn't one like it.It's undeniably original in the best and most obscene ways. Obviously, the films humor mainly revolves around bodily functions. Which means if fart jokes and such aren't funny to you than this movie may not be to appealing. In fact some of the early screenings at the Sundance Film fest saw people walking out around the thirty minute mark. More than likely because of this very reason.For me, I can get enjoyment out of this kind of humor but this movie also does so much more than just fart a lot. One thing that blew me away whilst watching was the films style. More specifically, its music. It's incredibly well done and original just like the film itself. What I loved about it was that it was completely acapella. Even more impressive was that all the lyrics directly played with what we are seeing on screen.It hints at characters thoughts and actions being performed. It fit extremely well with the directors style. Very natural and slightly surreal. The majority of the film is shot with natural light because the majority is out doors. Only in the various surreal sequences is studio lighting used. And it's used with just the right amount of grace to not be out place but to help enhance each scene.Of course great editing and performances help too. Both of which this movie has. Radcliffe and Dano have incredible chemistry and give some of their best performances to date. They really bounce off of each other from scene to scene. Which, for me, made the humor and message it was trying to get across that much more natural. The message the film has in store I won't spoil because it's plays a pretty pivotal role in the film but trust me when I say it's great.The only real disappointments come with the films conclusion. It goes on a bit to long and things start to get pretty convenient and out of left field. Some parts really don't make any sense what so ever and others just down right don't fit in the movie. There are a couple of parts of the movie involving a character dressing up and teaching the other about love. Those scenes are okay but they hinder the movie more than help.I couldn't help but think how they got the time to build all the stuff that they did. Like I thought you were starving, what's going on? Why are you spending all your time building stupid stuff? Aside from the films conclusion and the minor hang ups in pace I actually really enjoyed this movie. It's undeniably original, filled with heart, stylish, and above all very entertaining. 'Swiss Army Man' is one movie that I would love to see again right now, and it's one that you should see too.",Swiss Army Man

Here we are years latter, and its on Netflix, with rave reviews, and I'm thinking, ""Has everyone gone mad?"" So I had to watch it.The movie starts out with Hank stranded on a rocky island, trying to hang himself because his boat capsized, he's starving, lost, and given up hope for salvation. Just as he's about to hang, a person washes up. Later we find out his name is Manny. Manny had many talents, one of which is his farts propel them through the water to land. Yes his gas... At this point I'm about 15 minutes in, I've given the movie a fair shake, but I've come too far to just give up. What ensues is the most BIZARRE, buddy movie/bro-mance/romance film, with a little bit of magic in it. I honestly smiled a little in a couple places, but mostly I was disgusted by the bodily functions.I don't do spoilers, and I won't here, BUT, I don't want you to think it's all negative. Towards the end, everything starts coming together, and the revelations are MASSIVE. Paul Dano plays his character SO BEAUTIFULLY, that it breaks my heart just Loki n at the soulfulness in his eyes! He literally brought me to tears!!! He deserved a standing ovation, seldom other than on Broadway have I seen such an intense, emotional performance!I can't believe I'm saying this, but YES!

Sometimes frustrated because of the cookie-cutter films he needs to make to survive.Then one day he decides, on a dare, ""i will take the worst premise you can think of, and show you that a good film can still be made out of that"".And so Swiss Army Man was born. To be honest, the film is really well made. Sure, it's got an abundance of fart jokes, but the point is that it manages to make meaningful film out of such puerile material. And the introspection is moving, and on point.But, as the film drags on, the premise starts to weight against it; and by the time the overdue conclusion is on (and being kept super-vague to the point of being irritating), one starts wondering if it was not better to dedicate the same effort that went into this film into a simpler, more traditional plot of ""lone man"", such as Cast Away.Now, i know many people will love it, and i am not surprised. There is a lot of art in this film, but story-wise, it never escapes the guy-with- a-dead-body premise and as such, fails to develop into anything one can relate to.I'm not sure i would recommend Swiss Army Man; it's well made and funny, but it left me with a feeling of emptiness, as if after all, i had wasted my time.In my humble opinion, 6.5/10 - you might like it better.",Swiss Army Man

The older I get the more numb I become regarding movies, and everything just seems a rehash of something else, so when I see some spark of originality I am usually very happy. This is such a film. It is a very sad story told from a very different perspective that I can't help but admire it. People complain about the farts and the meaning of all that is on screen, but I really don't think this is such a hard movie to decipher. It's just a fresh look at mental illness and almost everything is very self-explanatory once you understand what's going on. Both leads do a fantastic job and the direction is very entertaining for such a hard subject.

Dano's acting is as usual excellent and that's the only real positive I have to say about the movie. Daniel Radcliffe is not bad playing the corpse, but to be fair I have no precedence for anyone acting as a farting, singling dancing corpse so I can only guess he was good, someone else might have done it better or worse. I get that's it's a fantasy film, but I would call Lord of the Rings fantasy, not this tripe. I think they put fantasy simply so people were less harsh in their critique about it. Anyone who says they like it is in my opinion trying to be 'arty' and pretentious cos no-one could sit through an hour and a half of this tripe and truly think it was fun.

87,tr91,Swiss Army Man,4,26 September 2016,"Some people will love this film and some people will hate it. I can see both sides of this argument & I'm not going to try and persuade anyone to watch it or avoid it. This is just a few of my thoughts on why I personally didn't like it.The film just didn't connect with me, it started off reasonably well as we are introduced to the two characters but after that it becomes a real slog which is seemingly going nowhere. We have constant fart & boner jokes and not much else. Then we have them moving from one place to another and going over the same jokes again which to me just wasn't funny. I didn't laugh once throughout the film.Although the film is undoubtedly unique, it just doesn't work for me as I felt no emotional attachment to either of the characters and at times I was utterly lost as to what the film was actually trying to be. The performances of Dano & Radcliffe were fine but for a film described as 'Adventure, Comedy, Drama' it was lacking in all 3 aspects. The whole soundtrack with the two characters singing parts of it was also pretty annoying.After an hour I had lost all interest and simply didn't care how it was going to end. So the film is obviously not for me but I can appreciate some parts of it and people with different taste will like it and that's fine. 4/10, didn't like it but it had two good lead performances and at least tried to be original.

88,Semisonic,A magic trick that didn't work out,6,11 October 2016,"I love sentimental surrealism. Despite not being something new, it's a genre that's not nearly explored enough. Which is a shame, considering the endless possibilities it provides: no solid rules, no rigid constraints, a total carte blanche for the author's creativity. Such films are hard to categorize and difficult to analyze, which is probably why the critics don't give them much love. Despite that, one of my most favorite movies of all time is Cashback - a pure little gem of surreal sentimentality.Swiss Army Man seems like a film that decided to follow the same direction. From the first moments on, its main weapon is the bizarre scenes and moments that make no logical sense, yet their sheer creativity and unexpectedness are amusing to say the least. The ""jet ski"" scene which culminates the film's prologue is probably the most insane cinematic experience I've had in years, and I mean it in a good way. I can only imagine how it was all conceived: Paul Dano is hanging out with his good friend Daniel Radcliffe, both stoned as heck, and then Paul says:Hey Dan, why don't we make a movie together duuuuude!That's such a raaaad idea dude! What's the movie gonna be about? Something about oil, like what you did with that other Daniel guy? He's got an Oscar for that one, remember?Nah maaaaan, more like gas! Gaaaas, if you know what I mean! (both start giggling moronically)Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against making fun of gas passing. But even a freshly made (or should I have said ""dealt"") fart joke is still a fart joke, and after a while it starts smelling (the pun intended). Swiss Army Man used that natural wonder to propel its pace and make us expect something really amusing. But eventually it becomes apparent that apart from those intestinal tricks this film is more like just a collection of a typical loser's whining, self-pity and wet dreams. Which is probably supposed to be cute and sympathetic, but is more boring and sometimes even annoying instead.It's quite clear what the authors were trying to achieve with this film. Swiss Army Man is not just a stranded person's journey home. It's a spiritual journey out of that emotional closet which some (maybe even most) of us live their whole lives in. However, just like the protagonist who's incapable of returning back to the world he was cast away from when it's within an arm's reach, the film itself simply fails to cap itself with anything more substantial than some more farting. And that's, basically, the only thing Swiss Army Man will be remembered for.",Swiss Army Man
89,lucasnochez,Film Review: Swiss Army Man,5,23 August 2016,"Going into Swiss Army Man, you cannot help but be prepared for the preposterous narrative at hand. I mean, the narrative is simple, well, kind of simplewell, not really. The newest film to feature the actor who once played one of the most magical and profitable wizards in the film world, seems to have taken another role which would add to his very large attempt of leaping him away, and disassociating himself afar from that world altogether. What better way to do it than play a kinda/sorta dead corpse who farts his way to safety, guides his best friend Hank (Paul Dano) with the use of his erection, and vulgars his dialogue at every instance with the female reproductive system.Okay so, lets try to get this right, as best as possible.Swiss Army Man tells the story of Hank, played by Paul Dano, a man who seems to be deserted on an island, with barely any willingness to live. Moments before he is about to kill himself, he sees a body washed upon the shore. Unbuckling the belt tied around his neck, he makes his way to the deceased body. Upon the discovery that the body is in fact dead, he hears the body pop up random farts and sounds, giving the illusion of life at times. Disillusioned by the body altogether, he salvages it and begins using it as a purpose to live.Dressing the corpse up, talking to it and interacting with it, Hank seems to have found a new purpose, that is until, the body, Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) begins to talk back. In a panic, Hank punches the corpse and runs away. Shortly after, Manny begins inhabiting certain skills and tools needed for Hank's survival, these skills include; farting fire, slingshotting stuff, axing things, etc. But don't get it twisted, the body is still dead. As the relationship between Manny and Hank begins to intensify, Hank shares with Manny the truths about women, sex and the world, revolving each and every story around the love of Hank's life, Sarah (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). As the days pass and the hope for survival begins to become more real, Hank soon realizes that, Manny may just be the soul-mate he has always hoped for and desired.Going into the film, I could already tell that the movie was going to play quite loosely with one of my most examined and tropes of cinema; augmented reality with reality itself. Just by looking at the trailers, the film blends quite effortlessly the seriousness of a stranded man, with the imagination of a man who creates an entity needed for his survival; Manny essentially becomes the Wilson to Tom Hank's character in Cast Away. In only difference is, Wilson never spoke back, interacted or physically helped Chuck Nolan to survive. Now, the film is obviously saying a lot and making a huge statement about mental health. Is Hank sick? Is there even a body? What is his relationship with the people outside this island? Who is Sarah to Hank? All these question, although never really fully answered, are given weight towards the understanding of a very, either sick, or extremely passionate man.One my biggest pet peeves about the use of imagination in cinema is when it tries to justify itself as reality. It really isn't that hard; any Marvel movie made from this point on, tries to provide some sort of justification how any of the stuff can happen, within the mythos of the cinematic world to the real world. In other films, say, Warcraft for example, the film establishes itself as work of fictions right away. With Swiss Army Man, the film seems to take itself more seriously than it should, mostly at all times. Directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, who refer to themselves as DanielS, find this very disturbing and at times, tantalizing mix of making the film extremely believable and at time totally and completely and utterly unbelievable, the embodiment of reality can be found no where yet tries to justify itself as such.The film itself is ridiculous, outrageous and yes, like many have been calling it, unlike anything you have or will ever see on the silver screen, but for once in my life, I don't necessarily think that that statement is really a good one. I mean, Hank, who goes from one island to a forestry area by riding his dead corpse friend as a jet-ski; Manny fights off bears, he has a erect penis compass, Manny is a swiss army tool of crazy possibilities and it never really digs deep.While speaking to others about the reception of the film, it does seem to have a very different response out of everyone who sees it. I mean, after all, the DanielS are the men responsible for the outlandish Turn Down for What music video featuring DJ Snake and Lil Jon, and we all know how funny and ludicrous that video is.There was no doubt in my mind, whilst leaving the cinema, I was ready to destroy the film altogether with a scathing review, propelling whomever I could away from it. Luckily, while thinking about the film, writing this review and discussing it with friends and fellow cinephiles, I have come to the overall realization that the film has a lot to say, after all the tits, ass, cocks, penis and poop talk. Questions arise by the end of the film that allow audiences to question everything that was seen throughout the hour and a half long film, discussing the mental state of people who are love- sicken, stricken of opportunity, bullied and taunted their whole lives; people who can be just like you or me.",Swiss Army Man

The body is Manny (Daniel Radcliffe) a name given to him by Hank. Hank tries to revive Manny but all he accomplishes is listening to Manny giving off tremendous amounts of gas. The rest of the movie is Hank protecting Manny and getting him to talk.When I saw the promos I saw where this may be a funny comedy. And , yes, thoughts of WEEKEND WITH BERNIE did enter my head, but this was not a comedy (well except for the gas coming from Manny) and I didn't see or hear anything funny the rest of the way. Hank discovers that Manny has supernatural powers.somewhatsort of.but don't get hung up on that as the most interesting aspect of that was the expulsion of gas that allows Manny to propel himself through the water. I lost all interest when Hank and Manny talk about masturbation and erection jokes that were not funny, and that went on for way too long. At that moment , I scanned the movie the rest of the way and probably lost any significant meaning to all this, and am doubtful there was any. Was this clever or just plain stupid? Since I didn't see any semblance of a comedy, I will go with stupid. However, all that said above I did find the acting by both Dano and Radcliffe to be pretty good, but since this was not a comedy that it should have been STUPID wins. (2/10)Violence: Not really.

92,quinimdb,Swiss Army Man,8,1 January 2017,"""Swiss Army Man"" is a movie that has gotten a lot of attention this year for using probably one of the strangest concepts since ""Being John Malkovich"". The film is about Hank, a man stranded on an island, who sees a corpse wash up onto the shore just as he was about to commit suicide. The opening credits consist of Hank riding the corpse across the ocean, powered by the corpse's flatulence. This corpse gives Hank hope. Within the first 10 minutes of the film, it is clear that this movie is going to be insane, but against all odds, it does grow on you. But by the last 10 minutes you won't know what is even real anymore. As the film began, I thought I understood what was going on. Yes, there is a farting corpse, but this corpse seemed to be a reflection of Hank, with all his insecurities and fears and secret desires, and it seemed as if the film would be Hank's journey to get over his fears. Hank's mom died when he was at a young age, and he never really had much of a strong connection with his dad, he was mostly made fun of in school, and never really had anyone to care about or love. He is basically completely alone and disconnected. Then the corpse begins to speak, and according to him, his name is Manny. It begins to become apparent that Hank and him share many memories, once again seeming to hint to the fact that Manny is a figment of his imagination. Again, from the start it is clear that all the music that we hear is coming from Hank thinking of the melody or tune, so it seems that we are witnessing the world from Hank's point of view, again showing that Manny may also be a part of his mind. The dynamic between the two characters is hilarious, and the tug and pull between Manny's unfiltered dialogue and Hank's oppressive attitude suggests his struggle of what he wants and what other people will think. After the end, I'm not so sure about what I think was really happening. What I can say is that the film is very original and surprisingly clever. It uses the low brow sense of humor to great effect, with a lot of physical comedy and witty gags coming from this concept of a magical corpse, while also having strangely heartfelt moments while still managing to be self aware. It is directed with style and energy, making the film consistently engaging and funny when this concept could've been very one note. Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are both great, and they should be, since they are the only 2 actors for the majority of the film, and one of them is a corpse.What I've come to think about the ending is that it's not about what is really happening or what's in Hank's head, but it's about the transition that Hank goes through at the end. He defies his self imposed rules, and he reveals himself for who he is, without holding back anything. He gets the reactions of surprise, confusion, and disgust, but he also gets understanding, which is shown through his father. And the point is that he really doesn't care what other people think, he's satisfied knowing that he doesn't have to hide himself anymore.I do think that the ending confuses things a little bit, but I like that it remained surprising and unpredictable to the very end. It seems like the filmmakers began writing the film with the intent of showing Manny as a part of Hank's mind, but I do understand why they would choose this more confusing ending that seems to contradict the assumption that Manny is a figment of Hank's imagination. At first I thought they were just trying to make it as weird as possible, but I think since the whole film is from Manny's perspective, these last moments are simply a way of showing that he has gotten over his self imposed loneliness. I didn't love the ending as much as the rest of the film, but it certainly didn't ruin the film for me. There were many ways this could've ended, and this at least seemed to make sense as far as the themes the film was going for.If ""Swiss Army Man"" is one thing, it's original. It's genuinely well-directed and well-acted, and there really isn't any other movie quite like this. Despite it being a quirky and funny comedy that involved a magical corpse and lots of gas, there was sincerity in this movie. You begin to connect with these two characters. It taps into universal fears such as loneliness and death, as strange as that sounds. Oh, and it has one of the best soundtracks of the year.",Swiss Army Man
93,palavitsinis,Awful - disgrace of a movie...,1,24 October 2016,"First of all, I would like to clarify that I am a movie lover. I watch everything, from utter crap, like Adam Sadler movies, or Will Ferrell to the ""deepest"" and most challenging or provoking movies. I consider myself intelligent enough to grasp a concept or two. Having said that, this movie was one of the worst wastes of time I have ever experienced. I stayed with it, till the end, so that I can have a valid and grounded opinion. I really expected something that would change my opinion towards the end, but this ""something"" never came. This movie is rubbish. I have not read a single review (looked at 10-20 of them) that can actually justify what the heck this movie is about. The only thing that I read constantly is how much of a masterpiece this movie is and how it handles serious issues etc. What are those issues? Does anyone care to elaborate? Or is this one of these movies that conveniently has a thousand hidden messages that can be interpreted in a million ways? Well, I have news for you. You can look at literally any movie like that. Even Fast and the Furious...! This movie is apparently about a Nekrophile, that somehow finds a body that is washed ashore and ""adopts"" it. He is ready to commit suicide or something and then he discovers the body and starts to interact and talk with it, forming some kind of a bond that even results to them kissing! At some point, he actually put a cork in the body's bottom, to keep water inside so that he can drink out of it (or some other elaborate metaphor, too difficult for my simple mind). Lots of ""clever"" metaphors here and there, that should make you think about death and life and how some things we pay attention to really don't matter, etc. In the end, as it turns out, although the guy seems to be taking some journey to return home after being hypothetically stranded somewhere, he was actually in a creek behind a residential area the entire time. Wow! Didn't see that one coming! And he's some kind of a lunatic or bipolar or I don't know what. In the end, Radcliff, disappears into the sea, farting his way in its blue vastness.

I could not make it to the end. It was horrendous. It was deeply annoying and I stopped watching it. It was a waste of Daniel Radcliffe's talent. OK he tries super hard to distinguish himself from the Harry Potter character. But why on earth would he play the role of a farting rotting corpse which is manipulated by a suicidal , depressed, schizophrenic , necrophiliac person, I do not understand this. I think that this movie was meant to be a parody, or a social experiment. I think the person who was behind all this said, hey let's do an experiment. Let's create a horrible movie, with a horrible plot and put a famous actor in it. Let's see how many people will be willing to watch our horrendous creation and what will they conclude. This was not a movie. This was a nerve breaking, annoying parody. But somehow it worked for some people because the ratings are 7 stars and above. I believe honestly that those who rated this movie well were either out of their minds, they were either trying to justify what they just saw by thinking that it had an allegoric deeper meaning, or much more possible they were sponsored to write a good review.

96,danielharden,Everything Everywhere Matters To Everything,7,14 October 2016,"Premiering at the Sundance Film Festival and from the crazy minds that brought you the insane viral music video to DJ Snake's Turn Down For What, comes the story about a man lost on an island, attempting to find home with the help of the farting, magical corpse of Harry Potter. Directed by Daniels and starring Daniel Radcliffe (and reviewed by another Daniel to keep the joke going), Swiss Army Man is very wacky and sweet dramedy about the importance of companionship and the pursuit of happiness.The film for the most part is about two men travelling in the woods. The film relies heavily on the performances of its leads. Even if the concept and series of events are as surreal as they are, if the acting isn't good then the film won't do very well. Fortunately for Daniels and crew Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are brilliant as Hank and Manny. The on screen chemistry of the two actors is extremely believable and it is their bromance that becomes the backbone of the film. Although it does at one point deviate slightly into weird-in-a-bad-way territory to the point that the directors interview with the telegraph is titled ""How we accidentally made a gay necrophilia movie."" (nothing happens please don't be discouraged) But for the most part their relationship is sweet and as I said, is the backbone that holds the film together.Also to note is Daniel Radcliffe's performance as Manny. Daniel Radcliffe is mesmerising as Manny, the farting corpse with magical abilities that helps Paul Dano's Hank get home. Radcliffe's performance is probably his best to date as he isn't simply a hilarious rag doll that farts, but he's a man who has forgotten about life and thus is reintroduced to it like a child, and it is that childlike innocents within Radcliffe's performance that makes the audience grow to love Manny. To sum up Manny and Radcliffe's performance I would say its adorable.The films music is brings a real indie vibe to the film with its acapella score. The music, like the performances, plays a huge part in making this film as sweet and delicate as it is as well as humorous in the instance on one specific montage. The score is soothing and satisfying to the ears. As they say music can alter moods, and so I would credit the music a lot as I felt very satisfied once the credits rolled.The only real issue I have is the closing of the film as it got confusing for no apparent reason and I'm not saying that because I didn't get it, there is literally a mix up confusion that in turn confused me but it turned out not to mean much. But aside from that this film is really satisfying to watch and brings about a feeling of hope.To conclude, Swiss Army Man is a weirdly wonderful film about perseverance, companionship and what it means to be happy. These optimistic messages, mixed with the brilliant performances, surreal concept and comedy all go together to create a really beautiful film that I highly recommend you watch.

It's really hard to explain the plot of the film so I am not even going to try but if there were two words to describe it would be - weird and funny. I really liked this film and laughed a lot throughout it while being very much confused about what on Earth is happening on the screen. But surprisingly through those funny moments the movie tells a very compelling story that has a meaning and it is very emotional. The soundtrack composed by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell also helps a lot on some of the scenes and the metaphors that are supposed to be stupid, work so well based on the story that the movie is telling, it is unbelievable just how well it benefited the film itself. It did honestly feel a bit too long even though it is only 97 minutes, but really overall this is an amazing experience at the movies, with incredible acting from the two main stars and a truly heartfelt well told story that works on so many levels and makes this film better than average.",Swiss Army Man
100,justinwfirestone,Not a goofy walk-out movie,7,10 July 2016,"When you hear a movie at Sundance inspires a large number of people to walk out, you know you gotta see it. Indeed, Daniel Radcliffe plays a farting corpse that Paul Dano can ride like a jet ski. The corpse also spits potable water and can shoot projectiles from its mouth.The farting is arguably too much, but the movie takes other chances by discussing why people think farts and masturbating are so bad in order to decompose societal propriety. It's also a lesson about determining what's important in life, and why we need other people to survive.The problem is that it's not goofy enough to be a cult hit, and it slams the goofiness with attempts at touching sincerity. The tale could be just as effective with fewer scenes, and the ultimate disappointment is we never really come to terms with what's eating Paul Dano.The movie is funny and quirky, and I can see why it wasn't palatable for some viewers, but it's surely not a movie to walk out on.

This movie ""Swiss Army Man"" is just so incredibly dire that I have, at least to try, to warn others. I watched the first tortuous 45 minutes which was basically one long, long and way over-done fart joke and a discussion of masturbation. At the 45 minute point, I started fast-forwarding, pausing from time to time to see if it had improved, even just a little. It didn't.The movie rates 7.0 on IMDb. That's USUALLY a fair indication that a movie has at least some merit. Regrettably, that's not always true.Paul Dano is one of my very favourite actors and Dan Radcliffe is also usually reliable. How they became involved in this project defies reason for two, at the very least, good actors.Thankfully, I only paid $2 for the disc on which I bought this movie.

105,Dello_,Crazy and original but also plenty of profound themes,9,14 April 2020,"""Swiss Army Man"" is a fantastic movie that is able to explore important themes in an unusual way thanks to a smart idea. Indeed the movie is about a man that hasn't any reason to live and it's thinking about suicide that becomes friend with a dead body. The fact is that the dead body at one point becomes alive but he has no idea of what life is. In a way is like a little child that asks to his parents simple questions about everything he doesn't know. But the dead body is an adult and so the movie can explore deeper themes like love, sex, social interaction and what life is in general. The way in which all of these aspects are touched is very original and very touching in some points with some poetic elements. The film is also very funny and it balances very well laughs and emotional moments. I've read a lot of criticism about the farting jokes but I feel the point is missed in these instances: farting in the movie is more important than mere jokes because it's a metaphor of freedom and trust.

107,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 95,10,12 July 2016,"If you watched the trailer for this film, you're probably aware that it's going to be pretty weird. Though you never expect it to be this weird.The uniquely and refreshingly strange tone is established right away. Paul Dano plays Hank, a young man who is stuck on an island about to commit suicide when he sees a dead body (Daniel Radcliffe) washed up on shore. Long story short, he discovers that this corpse has special abilities. It can satiate his thirst, chop wood in half, spit bullets out of its mouth, among other things. Soon, the body starts to talk.For almost the entirety of the movie we're trying to figure out if Dano is simply hallucinating or if the corpse really is coming to life. Many details are left for the imagination. But they don't even really matter.Much of the film is spent with Dano teaching Radcliffe about the world and how amazing it is. Yet Dano becomes conflicted as this is the same world he was trying to leave. Radcliffe has already left and wants to be back in it. They're passing each other going in opposite directions.The filmmakers never have an issue keeping the surreal tone of the movie. The only problem comes in the end where it seems as though, unsure of where to wrap things up, it strays a little and becomes slightly disjointed.Even if you think you know where the story is going, you never do. That's what makes it so great. It gives you what you could never ever expect. There are times it gets almost too weird--even for this film--but then again, there's nothing like it, so what do we really compare it to?It's never the weirdness that makes you not like the film. If anything, it could be the fact that it never truly says what it means to--or wants to. But in a universe so loose and free, you sort of have to be able to read between the lines.Twizard Rating: 95",Swiss Army Man
108,Equalizer16,Indescribable,9,30 September 2016,"Swiss Army Man is the new Indie Comedy survival drama, starring Paul Dano, and Daniel Radcliff. Combining an outstanding couple of performers, with consistent helpless comedy, and a brilliant original story. Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert direct this once of in a life time that explores values of life, the way of human beings, and the advantages of high powered farting. The most original film of the year, but also the weirdest film of the year that will certainly divide audiences, and as Daniel Radcliff said in an interview, this will become a 'cult' film.While on the verge of hanging himself on a deserted island, Hank (Dano) finds chance and meaning in his life again when he meets the washed up corps of Manny (Radcliff). When first learning Manny is only capable of speaking, Hank will then soon discover a whole new set of human impossibilities Manny possess as he used to help the pair survive and return to civilization.What the film then unfolds to is Daniel Radcliff and Paul Dano, having perfect chemistry together while revealing their perspective on life and the nature of human beings that pulls the audience along for the experience. We then discover a true enriching but crazy bro-mance form between the two that enters us into a whole new universe of life.What is key to the film is Paul Dano, and Daniel Radcliff's performances, both truly outstanding and charming from the both, creating clear fun characters that create the ultimate friendship ever before seen in film. Dano leads the way as Manny's puppeteer and the film's main average Joe, but presenting his life experience and opening our eyes to the worlds of normal life, and the wilderness survival lifestyle. Then we of course have the outstanding performance by Radcliff delivering a magnifying performance as the loving human tool kit Manny. Daniel has come a long way from Hogwarts and I hope to see more inspiring talent.What we then have is beautifully shot picture by Larkin Seiple, capturing every moment wonderfully, and entertaining and uplifting original score by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell.The film's particular style and tone will have you expressing constant smiles and laughs throughout as the comedy never stops. However, this it became clear that this is going to be a film that will not get positive response from everyone and that there will be audience who will reject the film by not understanding the style and meaning in the film. At the end of the day you will leave the cinema asking yourself 'what the heck did I just watch', some will find positivity in this, but some will see the opposite. It is a very unique piece of filmmaking that will always stand out alongside other films.It should be warned that, before considering to watch this film, you should probably watch the trailer first and then decide whether you liked what you saw, and if not, then this film will not be for you. Alternatively, if you like what you see then you'll likely really enjoy it.Swiss Army Man is a very unique weird, funny, brilliant picture, with en captivating performances by Dano and Radcliff and is a stand out film of 2016 and must be seen, but by the right audience. 9.6/10",Swiss Army Man

We complain about no original stories, then when we get them, we don't watch them or just bash them...However, it's just to out there and goofy for me. I know it's got all kinds of hidden meanings and messages spread throughout... but I think I missed most of them. I know there's some grand point to it... but again, I maybe missed it.Yes, it allowed him to understand what really matters in life, and how we shouldn't allow the small things and our fears to hold us back... but it seems there is more trying to be said/taught here than just that... but yeah..I couldn't STAND Daniel as the Harry Potter character, yet everytime I watch him on film, I find it impossible to dislike him, his pure talent shows in all of his adult work. The guy is a great actor, and I believe he's extremely undervalued in Hollywood. Maybe it's being linked to Potter, maybe it's that he doesn't quite fit the ""sexy"" stereotype of a leading man... I don't know, but whatever it is, it needs to be gotten over, because Daniel could star in and lead almost any sort of film, with any sort of cast. His recent work in ""Jungle"", ""Horns"", ""Woman in Black"", ""Guns Akimbo"" showed us once again, this man can pull off any role!

112,texshelters,There is enough unique and interesting material in this film to recommend it.,10,6 July 2016,"Swiss Army Man: You never know what you will getThe film ""Swiss Army Man"" is a unique and funny take on human desires and emotions. A man wanders away from society, Paul Dano's Hank, in an attempt to get away from it all. However, he meets Manny who leads him down a different path. Manny tries to teach Hank that life is worth living. They talk about love, life, forgiveness, and loneliness. However, they talk about it not in a hyper-intellectualized fashion as in 'My Dinner with Andre', as rom-com hormone infused pablum, or in a fantasy driven romance where love at first sight exists (when we all know it's lust at first sight). They talk about love and sex as two regular lonely guys who are horny and have feelings. Hank is clearly messed up about the whole issue of love and sex, so much so that he obsesses about it while he is starving and nearly dying of thirst. But alas, that is the biological imperative, is it not? Both Dano (Hank) and Radcliffe (Manny) do a credible job with these emotions. Hank explains life to Manny, and Manny uses his many incredible talents to help them survive. You will have to see the film to learn more. Near the end of the film, we are introduced to a diabolus ex machina moment to propel the plot toward the ending. The random terrible occurrence comes across as false and contrived and could have been handled better. There are other moments when a revelation created by trauma could have happened, and it would have made more sense. Yes, while bizarre, this film has its own internal logic. That leads me to the ending. By the time we reach the conclusion, it almost doesn't matter what happens. Yes, I know, sacrilege! Feel free to write to the unpaid critics union to have me banned. It's not that the ending doesn't matter, it's that the good material in the film has already happened, and almost nothing can ruin it. That said, the writers and director, duties shared by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, missed a great opportunity for philosophical ambiguity. They got scared away from what could have been a great ending to a very interesting movie. Was there a producer, there are at least a half dozen for this film, telling them to make the ending clear and not so dark? That's possible. Whatever the case, the ending was too obvious and easy for a film that was so risk taking until then. The first half hour of the film is slow. After that, it's a fast ride on a jet ski to the ending. The film is charming, despite the setting and state of desperation the characters are in. It explores many issues around personal identity without coming across as 'rich person's' problems. Hank is clearly suffering and we learn about why, at least partly, as the film progresses. Rating: Pay full price. Despite the director and writer taking the easy way out at the end, pressured or not, there is enough unique and interesting material in this film to recommend it.

113,Mikelikesnotlikes,"Strange, strange and a bit more strange",5,11 April 2017,"Swiss Army Man is a vehicle that doesn't carry its own weight through to the end. There's a definite failure to realize when the audiences' suspension of disbelief is at breaking point. Several times metaphors went so far down the wrong paths, it was like they couldn't find their way back again.There were ample opportunities to make this a decent film. The way it was told through a lonely, suicidal young man eyes, and telling his story of rebirth through the use of a corpse was unique. Watching him claw himself back from the depths of madness by conversing with the dead man could have worked, and definitely gave them license to include a lot of those VERY strange activities. But in the end it didn't come together. I didn't get the sexual angle at all. Was he a repressed gay man? Was that his whole confusion throughout the movie? What was it about the word retarded that was supposed to be so hurtful to him? It wasn't explored at all. I often have trouble grasping some movie metaphors and often miss important or significant events which makes the whole experience less engaging. Sometimes I have to read other reviews to get the plot intricacies. But I think Swiss Army Man just fails to deliver a coherent plot. They wanted to have their cake and eat it too by continuing with the fantasy angle well after reality should have kicked in.I was positively pacing and hoping Swiss Army Man would end for the last 10 minutes. If I hadn't invested so much time I would have shut it down after Hank emerged from the 'wilderness'. But I clung to the hope the Director would pull something clever out to the box and wrap it up with some sort of logic. They chose to go with more fart jokes and pure fantasy. It felt like they just kept on tacking more and more scenes on well after it was time to call a wrap.Might be good for stoners. Left me feeling flat and weirded out.",Swiss Army Man

116,TonyDood,Learning how to live by hanging with a dead guy...,7,23 March 2017,"Imagine the pitch: What if, on the eve of deciding you must take your own life in a remote location, you see a random dead guy washed up on the shore and, through a series of exercises in human physiognomy, including chronic flatulence and tumescence, the corpse (or zombie?) becomes your friend, teaching you how to live a more fulfilling life? Cheers to the studio(s) that funded this fun, clever, gross, touching and very dark comedy/bromance, and here's hoping discerning, intelligent movie audiences can continue to get more quality films that push envelopes the way this one does.Taking a cue from the old story ""Teig O'Kane and the Corpse,"" ""Swiss Army Man"" spends much of it's running time creating a relationship between someone at the end of his rope and someone who has passed the end of his rope, as our hero drags and carries around his talking cadaver pal. The conversations that take place between the living character played by Paul Dano and his new, deceased companion played by Daniel Radcliffe, include ruminations on growing up ashamed of your body and bodily functions and how it can translate into a broken sense of ego, destroying your ability to love and be loved. In fact, there's a possibility (spoiler here, perhaps) that all of this is merely a projection played out in the head of our hero. I don't think it is though; the fact that ""evidence"" is captured on video at the conclusion of this story suggests that the whole thing really was supposed to be taking place in the ""real world,"" which makes the film a kind of dark fairy tale. I'm reminded of Todd Solondz' ""Palindromes,"" which also (successfully) found whimsy in topics that are generally thought of in polite society as being taboo.There is a lot of whimsy here...Dano's ""Hank"" exerts a great deal of energy to try to convince Radcliffe's ""Manny"" (or perhaps himself) of the importance of loving yourself and then others, while utilizing piles of junk to recreate scenes in real life (a cinema, a bus ride) that would make the castaways of Gilligan's Island proud (and the film has many such fun and familiar references to other works). The elaborate set-ups and the clever way this business is filmed reminds one of the work of Michel Gondry (and, unfortunately, sometimes succumbs to the same kind of preciousness Gondry's work suffers from) but is a feast for the eyes.So too is the work of Radcliffe--what a dream it must be to be able to take on roles like this after the tedium of the Harry Potter films, and you can tell Radcliffe is having a great time. With his gravelly, stroke-victim speaking style and childish questions he creates a character something in-between the child robot in ""AI"" and Peter Falk. He jumps in with his entire (broken) body and goes places a lot of actors wouldn't have the (literal) guts to go. In fact, much of the enjoyment of the film (if that's what it is) is the focus on the flesh, guts and bones of ""Manny's"" dead body in all its repulsive, eruptive glory and it's hard to take your eyes off his fascinating, distorted face. David Cronenberg probably wishes he made this one. Dano is also fun to watch and gives a compassionate, touching, near-pathetic performance that veers just on the edge of going too far into child-like slapstick.The film is far from perfect...the ending drags and one senses the filmmakers spent a great deal of time trying to outsmart today's sharp and literal-minded audiences. I found the ending satisfying but that's because I didn't have any expectations by that point. If the film had ended (spoiler again) in the ""real world,"" it would have been awfully depressing but would probably have been more true to the set up. As it is, the ending fits into the ""anything goes"" premise set up earlier on.There's also the ""precious/cute"" quality, the glorification of vulgar bodily function gags, long stretches that push credibility and a score that sometimes enthralls but often as not irritates. Clearly part of the reason this movie was made was to showcase digital effects but the effects work is sometimes a bit cheap looking (but I'm in the FX industry so maybe more critical).But overall this is an original, engaging and well-produced piece of cinema that is meant for a specific type of audience. It's likely to irritate people who expected a mainstream comedy (to which I would query, did you watch the trailer? What were you expecting?), people who want Radcliffe to stay Harry Potter and people who are insecure with their sexuality (the film bravely crosses a line into glorification of two men experimenting with each other physically, hinting at necrophilia, as well as focusing on Mr. Radcliffe's bare derriere several times). But for the rest of us, who like films that challenge while entertaining, that offer shocks that exist for more than just shock value and are visually fulfilling, this film is a rare treat. It's free on Amazon right now, if you're at all intrigued, check it out while you can...it's a brisk, zippy little film that, even if you hate it, will probably stick with you, which is more than I can say for any of the endless Harry Potter films.",Swiss Army Man

118,taryllsbaker,Dano & Radcliffe are remarkable in this truly unique film by Daniels.,10,22 September 2016,"Swiss Army Man is written & directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (aka The Daniels) and stars Paul Dano, Daniel Radcliffe, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Timothy Eulich and Richard Gross.A hopeless man stranded on a deserted island befriends a dead body and together they go on a surreal journey to get home.It's been a while since I watched a film as entertaining as Swiss Army Man. It's funny, full of heart, beautifully shot and incredibly original. Though it seems like a simple concept, it's fully packed with interesting ideas and features two brilliantly written characters.Dano & Radcliffe are remarkable. Their characters share an undeniable chemistry while stumbling through a forest that pushes their boundaries and in turn forces them to survive in the most imaginatively bizarre way possible. Both performances feel grounded with an everlasting, passionate eye for detail. Radcliffe's character, Manny, though just a dead body, slowly expands into something much more with an exuberant display of emotion. Dano is impressive as the lonely Hank, presenting a calm and feeble side to the character that connects us as an audience to the duo on-screen. The soundtrack is its own experience. Instead of the usual technique in modern day film scoring, The Daniels have decided to cut back to simple ambient voicing. Having Dano & Radcliffe sing, really solidifies how sensationally dynamic these directors are in their storytelling. Andy Hull and Robert McDowell have written these vocals as a driving melody and build their intricate framework around the performances. Every scene, every moment, connects wonderfully and goes hand-in-hand with the energetic music throughout. This film looks stunning. We follow Hank & Manny peacefully as cinematographer, Larkin Seiple captures the essence of the forest as if it's a character itself. It's visually vibrant, much like the performances and perfectly ties the whole film together. Unfortunately it's likely that, due to its humour and the bigger films being released, this film will struggle to find a specific audience. But anyone who does discover it will be pleasantly surprised. It's playful in its storytelling but shows admirable strength in its originality. This is a must-watch.Verdict; Swiss Army Man is a strangely wonderful tale of survival featuring both Dano & Radcliffe in tour de force performances. The latter accompanied with an energetic soundtrack by Hull & McDowell completes the package, delivering one of the most uniquely authentic films in years. Swiss Army Man, 10/10.",Swiss Army Man

They had him ride the body like a sled back to the ocean in 30 seconds (when it seemed to take weeks to come the other way?) in order make everything real and literal in front of the other people in a supposed emotional tear-jerking ending.

122,CinePendejo,"The boldest smartest, and weirdest movie of 2016",9,2 July 2016,"Watching Swiss Army Man feels like watching a high-wire stunt performed by two clowns while juggling bowling pins and rubber chickens. Not only does this act look absurd and devoid of conventional, but looks dangerous. A bizarre mixture of Cast Away and a Looney Tunes episode couldn't help but stumble by the weight of its own ambition, either by being too obnoxious or too sappy. At any minute, this films could fall apart completely, and watching it succeed gracefully had me cheering after it's over. And while I'm aware that calling movies stunt shows proves little more than banal and gratuitous bullcrap straight out of any pseudo-prestigious factory, the films real secret to greatness is how much it gets away with hidden meanings and poignant themes. That along with the gonzo lunacy of the films mechanics easily makes Swiss Army Man one of the boldest and the most meaningful movie of the year.And yes, we're still talking about the movie where Harry Potter plays a dead corpse farting across the ocean like a jet ski.The story centers around Paul Dano as Hank, a depressed shell of a man who, after being shunned by society is now stranded on a deserted island and attempts suicide. He then stumbles across dead body (Daniel Radcliffe) that somehow has super powered farts and decides to ride him across the ocean. Once they make it to another island, Hank befriends this corpse (named Manny) and realizes that the more he comes to realize every aspect of life – like making friends, being weird, masturbating (really.), and asking girls out – the more the corpse can perform an array of bodily functions; ones that range to basic like speaking, and other on the weird spectrum like vomiting fresh water out of your mouth and shooting bullets from your mouth. Realizing the potential of this mechanic, Hank grows accustomed to Hank so that he could have enough superpowers to get him home. Now there is LOADS of things to cover on how ridiculous this sounds, but the way the film straight up goes with it is part of the charm. No matter how silly it gets with Hank using Manny as either a karate- chopping wood cutter or a pebble-shooting gun, the movie finds a lot of moments of introspection and emotion at the piece. We see both of these broken people both coping and ultimately aiding each other with their issues (Hank being a depressed dweeb with his whole life kicking him around and Manny being, well dead) and finding ways to either work around their issues or embrace them to their advantage. It all culminates to of the films beautiful revelations, that everyone is either broken and weird and all we can do is either face or live up to, these ailments, all while not having to drench itself with too many twee sensibilities to pull it off.Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe are both amazing in their roles. Their chemistry feels real, not just considering their more ""passionate"" physical acting (though those shouldn't be passed up either) but by sheer matter-of-fact friendship, as they both come to terms with both of their uncanny status. While it's easy to pull out the ""Nobody Does a Dweeb Better Than Dano"" card, the real treat is watching him create this shallow, creepy character into something palpable. I've been watching this guy perform for years, and this is easily the best role he ever agreed on. Radcliffe, on the other hand, is nothing short of revelatory, instantly making a dead guy feel so full of life. From his head dangling on one side in every scene while he tries to form words with his barely- functioning mouth to the way he executes deadpan humor flawlessly, this proves that Radcliffe's indie career trajectory after the Harry Potter movies finally pay off.But it's even more than that still, believe it or not. While merely any average Joe walking into this movie can enjoy the much nonsensical scenarios with human appendages straight out of the ""Turn Down for What"" music video playbook – which is what, coincidentally, is the directors of this movie were responsible – the more outside-the-box the audience can think of many of the films subtexts and get a kick out of that too. It could be how a child comes to grips with the strange world we call Earth. It could be about how a man tries to explain what life really is about while also understanding the details that he didn't realize. It could be about how two worlds of grounded cynicism and absurd optimism coalesces as one. It could be about how we accept our oddities in a world full of dreary conformity.Heck, that last part could metaphorically be one of the main reasons why I love this movie so much. In the recent summer deluge of uninspired sequels, dull remakes, and manipulating adaptations, here's Swiss Army Man coming straight out of the Film Festival scene walking in the rain with a bright raincoat and a clown face, begging for the world to get over their baggage and greet the unique creation with open arms. That is pretty much Swiss Army Man in a nutshell: a unique creation with everything opposing the predictable. Silly yet earnest, smart yet playful, meaningful yet consistently so, bold yet simple. Whether or not you believe me when I say this, but notwithstanding this gonzo mechanics, this is perfect in the way it wants to be. Definitely worth a watch.https://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-swiss-army-man.html",Swiss Army Man
123,dlracer2,This is probably the best movie ever made. I'll tell you exactly why.,10,14 May 2019,"I'd like to think I have a special connection with Hank. I've been through some of the things he has, some obvious, some things are going missed that only a person like me might notice. This film deals with real life matters that make people uncomfortable, which says a lot about every human being. Recurring themes of rejection, and infatuation are visited and revisited in monologue and behavior. In life, many people spend their whole lives avoiding uncomfortable topics that shape us through our whole life, and these are the people discarding this masterpiece.It's important to recognize that Hank has lost his battle with sanity. He's grappled with the notion of suicide repeatedly, and has grown up with the fantasy that a ""happily ever after"" life is just around the corner. (Most of us are indoctrinated on this concept by loving parents). The more desperate Hank is to have it, the more disconnected he becomes with reality. The death of his mother has caused a tremendous rift between himself and his father, in which both are unable to recover. (Trust me this movie is more about the death of his mother than anything). Sexual desire has always played a negative role on Hank. This was likely passed from his father when his father was unable to cope after his mother died, and repressed all natural sexual urges on to Hank. Hank grew up through puberty disgusted with his own body, and meeting rejection from every girl he's ever known because he's so uncomfortable with himself which is compounded by how his mother tried to explain what it means to grow into puberty before she died. Every thought he has about attraction is repressed, and he hates himself for it. His pure intentions are to find love. The trauma that has been building up within him has forced him to live daily in fantasy, and no one can relate to him anymore. He doesn't talk about his feeling/misgivings to anyone. His shame becomes so overpowering that he runs off into the forest to disappear in the hope someone will care enough to come find him (he's hoping it's his dad). He begins to live a fantasy where he hasn't run off, but is a castaway of an unexplained boat sinking on an island. (There never was an island, but he DID try to kill himself, and botched it.) He found a dead body on the shore and began talking about all of the things that were eating him up inside, that no one was there for him since his mother died years ago. At some point, either through reckless starvation and stress he completely loses his grip on reality, and imagines Manny has come to life. But something happens in the cave and some things Manny does ARE REAL. Hank is so out of touch with reality, he can't tell the difference anymore. He begins to heal by becoming a mentor to Manny. (WHO IS ACTUALLY HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL). I believe Manny is actually the spirit of his mother.Manny and Hank begin to talk only about the things that are causing him so much pain. Especially his pure intentions hidden behind his shame of natural things that have been taught to be vile, and repulsive (Probably by his father). He finally learns that living life, and living to the fullest involves all of those vile and repulsive things we are all conditioned to discard.He reveals that he needs his father's love to Manny and it is painstakingly obvious that the two of them never mourned the death of Hank's mother together.The whole climax of the movie is a truly sad one. Hank talks about the virtual birthday card, and his sadness is portrayed as a brutal need for his love.Manny does in fact come to life a few times to save Hank, and he is alive when he talks to Sarah's daughter. The little girl is not afraid of Manny because there is a connection of innocence.After all of the themes mentioned, and some not mentioned, Hank finally speaks to Sarah, WHICH IS THE FIRST TIME HE'S EVER ASKED FOR HELP IN HIS LIFE ~He is THAT repressed. He is really avoiding his father because their relationship is completely broken. He begins to deal with the reality of the infatuation that could have lead to real love has now passed.His father's character is perfectly conveyed when he shows up to identify the body (which he was told to be his son's). His father is driving an old truck that probably has sentimental ties to his wife, and he doesn't look like he's doing well. At this time I assume Hank's father's character has settled into a dead end job, and hasn't grown beyond what he was when he lost his wife. ""Essentially my dad personally. Hank isn't ready to talk to his father, and is afraid of what he might say. Hank's dad goes to identify Hank's body, but absolutely can't. He's crushed, it's too much to bear. When Hank sees his father's reaction, he actually starts to feel loved, and doesn't want Manny to be unloved. He abandons his hope for himself in order to prevent Manny from being discarded.The cops, news, Sarah and Hank's father come across the things Hank has built in the forest, and his father sees the dummy Hank made of him, and realizes how much he has wasted with his relationship with his son after the death of his wife.By the time Hank is ready to let go of his fantasy, he's put himself in such a looney bin his life future will never be worth living unless he knows for himself some of the things he did were really real.He's strong enough to face his demons, but as he walks off, our guardian angel, Manny, decides to show a small gesture that Hank is not completely insane, and the magical things he's rambling on about might have actually happened.In that moment his father saw Hank in a completely different way. He never understood Hank, or nurtured him, but he wasn't ashamed of him at all despite everything that has happened.
This was all his father needed to revive his relationship with his son, and be the nurturing support that Hank has been denied since the death of his mother. (Which I believe Manny, was his mother all along.). ""But personally, I believe that things like that happen from time to time just out of range of our perception ""MASTERPIECE",Swiss Army Man
124,wisneskilife,Eh?,6,26 December 2018,"Don't let my rating mislead anyone, Swiss Army Man is probably the most ""creative"" movie, I've ever seen. However, creative in this case is not necessarily good. This movie is very layered. There are complex ideas building off of one another while having these absolutely crazy things happening in the background. Without spoiling too much, I think the romance between the main characters needed to blossom more and differently. I also think the ending was just bad. I can see why the artsy nature of Swiss Army Man won it awards, but I was not a fan and would not watch it twice.",Swiss Army Man
125,AverageJoesDriveInPodcast,A wondefully weird film with a lot of heart,8,22 May 2018,"I'm so glad I finally watched this. What a wonderfully odd movie. Paul Dano & Daniel Radcliffe both give grade A top-notch performances. There's so much heart to this film, something I was rather shocked by. I found myself laughing out loud during several scenes at the comical, albeit crude absurdity of the situation and actions of Hank and Manny. Then, there were other scenes where I found myself almost holding back tears at the heartfelt conversations between them. There is a simple, yet relatable loneliness and sadness to Hanks character I think many people can relate to. While it may not be as deeply seeded as his, we've all gone through moments like that in our lives. Times of self-doubt, moments where we don't feel good enough, or attractive enough, or afraid we're going to make an idiot of ourselves for saying or doing the wrong thing. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic as Manny. There's a childlike curiosity and wonder to his character as he tries to remember life. The same goes for the bluntness and honesty in his responses and questions. At the core, it's a story that says, sometimes we just need a friend to bring out the best in us and show us our lives are more than just what is on the surface. That it's who we are deep down in our beings that counts, that life is too short to not show others how much we care, or to not take chances because of our insecurities and fear. I think that's a beautiful thing when a film can make you feel those emotions and be entertaining at the same time. That's just what this beautifully weird little film managed to do for me.
My Rating: 8/10",Swiss Army Man
126,lovethesun,God awful,1,2 March 2019,This movie is right up there with the worst I have seen in my entire life. Anyone who gives this high ratings is classless and gets entertainment from farts. Pure garbage.,Swiss Army Man
127,bartonj2410,It's not a masterpiece but it's still worth your time,8,2 October 2016,"I'm not the first to say this and I sure as hell won't be the last when I say that Swiss Army Man is easily one of the most out there films I have, and will likely, ever see. This is a film that has to be seen to be believed because no amount of words can do justice to the quite fascinating example of original cinema that Swiss Army Man is.Hank (Paul Dano) is a man who's been stranded on deserted island for a while and has only one thought left on his mind; suicide. That is until he comes across a corpse (Daniel Radcliffe) washed up on the shore. After learning that the corpse possesses a number of attributes that could help him survive, Hank and the corpse go on a surreal journey to get home.On paper, Swiss Army Man is a film that really shouldn't work yet, thanks to the creative minds of Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, it's a film that explores the theme of loneliness in such an admirable way, becoming one of 2016's most infectious films to date.The comedic elements combine very well with the sentimental nature of the film, hard to think when you hear that a film about a man contemplating suicide also features a corpse with incessant flatulence and the ability to use an erection as a compass. You either go with it and enjoy the film or find it too obscure and most likely end up hating it.Coming to the performances, Swiss Army Man features not one, but two fantastic lead performances from both Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe. Dano is an actor who continues to impress me with each performance, feeling like one of the most underrated actors working today in my opinion while doing so. Then there's Radcliffe, an actor who continues to break away from his Harry Potter days with each and every film. With this and Imperium out in 2016, Radcliffe has certainly shown a willingness for diversity in his career and he's fascinating to watch in Swiss Army Man.Mary Elizabeth Winstead's final line of ""What the f**k?"" is one that perfectly sums up the bizarre yet joyously entertaining Swiss Army Man. Just think if Quentin Tarantino had made Cast Away, it would end up like this.",Swiss Army Man
128,paulmcuomo,"There really, REALLY is nothing like this. At all.",8,5 November 2017,"I'm writing this review after re-watching Swiss Army Man, not because I didn't get it the first time out, but because my initial review got wiped when my laptop crashed. Looking back, I think it's fair to say my opinion hasn't changed, but it's much different watching it outside of a cinema.The main thing a lot of people have commented on regarding this movie is the way it makes farts a thematic device to signify character development. I repeat: it makes farts a thematic device to signify character development. This statement alone shows how this movie deserves a certain amount of recognition beyond its weirdness.That being said, this movie certainly embraces its weirdness, but only in the sense of its goes with its premise whole-heartedly and works for it. And what really makes the movie work is the odd-couple relationship between Hank and Manny, played respectively by Paul Dano, whose an extremely underrated actor who shows here to be playing the gambit from suicidal to overjoyed, from loneliness to wholeness, with drama and comedy, and also Manny the farting corpse, who is played to Oscar calibre standard by Daniel Radcliffe - what? If an actor like Eddie Redmayne can win for what he did in Theory of Everything, a physically demanding part, why not Radcliffe for the way he has to move completely unnaturally, but also show emotional growth beyond the simple gimmick of the character's one-line description? Seriously though, this is some of the best work Radcliffe has and will ever do: Manny is kind of like Jeff Bridges' portrayal of Starman, in that he is a mystical, magical kind of presence and it is endearing to watch him learn, but he also paces the dialogue amazingly. For instance, his retorts to Hank about masturbation become a sweet monologue about the same thing later on.That's the biggest draw about this movie - the amount of heart shown in both its direction, its score, its effects on Manny as he's used for a wide variety of purposes and uses, and the way it builds to a moment that should on paper be dumb - Hank shows he's not afraid to fart in public, Manny becomes revived and Hank says something to him, maybe ""thank you for saving me"" but I don't know, and they exchange one last smile as he farts out to sea - into a moment of real-touching cinema.OBVIOUSLY, this film isn't for everyone. If you can accept what's happening, and suspend disbelief, this is a rewarding viewing experience.",Swiss Army Man

I'm not a Harry Potter fan, however, I think Danielle Radcliffe is an extremely talented actor with quite the range (Woman in Black, Imperium, Horns...)and his role as a dead guy with a personality was fantastic. Paul Dano did a great job as well. The issue with this film was the GAS (flatulence). While the corpse never ran out of gas the use of that sure did. I'm the type that fins well timed fart extremely funny. I love South Park so it's not like it offended or bothered me in that way. It just became old and stale. And who likes old stale gas? The story itself was clever and unique. It just turned into a Weekend at Bernies meets Castaway meets South Park. The clever use of the corpse for survival, both physical and mental, got lost behind the tediousness of constantly using the flatulence. And they would repeat the way they used it making it even less funny. The emotional drama behind it could have been more, well emotional, if it didn't just become silly. Also compliments to some Great cinematography. I notice a lot of rave reviews and some people definitely got more out of this than I did and I am glad they enjoyed it. You may too.",Swiss Army Man

I actually downloaded it on Spotify.The whole idea of the film is ridiculous, and it is very original. You really can't compare anything to this movie.

133,organicsocial,"Morbid, Macabre and Metamodern",7,9 October 2016,"Ah the unbearable stress to create something original in this increasingly unoriginal world! We are past the post modern times when cynicism was a new thing. Science and promise of an Utopian future are also not what drives us anymore. Instead we see a world constantly struggling against new challenges. The pressures of surviving in a fast evolving culture, the fear of falling into clichés and the utter lack of things to create that will be valued forever. Swiss Army Man is an interesting peek into the changing sensibilities of post-post-modern art. Its gross and beautiful at the same time. Simultaneously meaningless and meaningful. It jerks around with the characters only to dive into very emotional conversations about love, life and loss. This maybe one of the best examples of meta-modernist cinema that dares you to embrace magical realism without shame. Well, most of the plot can be either interpreted as a weird, metaphorical revelation with a hint of spiritual realization or as a complete nonsense arising from a mental disorder. That is the clever thing about Swiss Army Man. It is unlike anything you may have seen so far. There may be more movies like this coming out soon. Strangely, when you watch it, despite the disturbing visuals, it is calming. The background score is eerie and comforting at the same time. It is this polarity of sensory perception that makes Swiss Army Man more than just an oddity. The macabre in this movie may be something that Aleister Crowley might have found really amusing. He might have even funded a sequel with some of his own ideas! Daniel Radcliffe has certainly gone to extreme ends as an actor to shed off his Harry Potter persona. Now that he plays a literal corpse, it is safe to say that he may have managed to get past his wand waving fame. Paul Dano on the other hand seems to have slowly crafted his career as an understated yet recognizable actor. His award winning roles are proof of that. Swiss Army Man is the second film after Ruby Sparks where Dano plays a part that merges reality and fantasy. It does remind me of Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983), a Bollywood movie that also had a dead body central to the plot. However, it is completely different in everything else.

137,Bryan_Roderick,Dichotomy between being alone and being miserable.,8,6 July 2016,"Swiss Army ManDirected by Dan and Daniel Sheinert, Swiss Army Man is about a lost man who has been alone for too long and is starting to go insane. A corpse shows up with magical undead (farting) powers. You need to be told there's going to be a plethora of flatulence before seeing this film. Once you get past the first ten minutes, if you haven't walked out yet, you're in for a treat.Hank, played by Paul Dano, is the lost sole who has a troubled past. Why he got lost in the first place is a bit of a spoiler. He's timid and very self conscious about ever action he takes place. Heck the corpse farts in front of him, but he still goes off to fart where no one can see him. Paul Dano is one of Hollywood's true talents. Ever since There Will Be Blood and Little Miss Sunshine, he's been on my radar as an up and coming actor. Daniel Radcliffe and his delicious (cards against humanity) farts, plays the corpse named Manny. At first he's just a corpse but slowly he becomes everything that Hank needs to survive, both physically and psychologically. Even though he's a corpse D-Rad does a wonderful job.The entire film is pretty much the dialogue between Hank and Manny. Showing the dichotomy between being alone and happy, and being in love and miserable. The catharsis of old fashioned beliefs about life, morality, and society. In a way, this farting corpse movie has a lot to say about deep emotions.I was pleased to see Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the film. I think she's stunning and for her brief appearance she made me smile. Both in the words she spoke and how she acted.Verdict: If you can put past the farts into the back of your mind, this film is harmless and enjoyable to watch.

Ok, yeah, it has some psychological aspects to it, which can be appealing, but the stupidity of the movie ruins any good qualities it has. For an idea of what you're in for, the main character literally rides a corpse he found like a jet ski being propelled by the corpse's farts (not kidding), uses the corpse as a never-ending water fountain he drinks from, causes the corpse to develop an erection, which is then used as a compass, oh, and let's no forget about the subtextual themes of necrophilia. Yeah, there's dumb stuff like this throughout the whole movie. And while you can debate that not everything actually happens was real and some takes place in the main characters mind, it doesn't take away the sheer stupidity of what we're seeing. Maybe it would have been better if it had been strictly about the guy using the corpse to communicate with in order to cope, but all this other stuff they threw in ruins all of the good qualities the movie has. I really don't see the appeal and can't believe it's gotten as much praise as it has.",Swiss Army Man
139,ThatAnimeSnob,gross but has its charm,6,26 December 2016,"Swiss Army Man is a hard to appreciate movie if you are not in the proper mood for it. It is full of gross humor as it is full of mindfuck moments. It seems simple at first and gets multilayered later on. It starts as a comedy and changes into a drama.If you go in completely blind, and you are not in a mood to watch something completely retarded, chances are you will walk out after 15 minutes. The premise is essentially the dumb version of ""Cast Away"", which is hardly enough to excuse its existence as a parody of it. The only actual hook the film has is watching the actor who played Harry Potter being ridiculed in a hundred different and disgusting ways. Seriously, unless you seek some sadistic pleasure out of watching that stupid wizard and his overrated books getting some weird G-mod treatment by getting tossed around like a rug doll, you won't be laughing. You will be cringing.And boy, are there lots of cringe moments in this movie. It goes for all the low blows by having fart jokes, puke joke, erection jokes, poop jokes, and so much more. Half the time it's like a bottom tier slapstick comedy you watch once and forget the following day.The other half of the movie though tries to excuse it as part of the deranged mentality of the protagonist. He is a loser with nothing good going on in his life, thus all the ridiculous things that happen to him are part of his characterization. If they were not that extreme and lame, you wouldn't understand his mental suffering. So basically, you should be viewing all the mindfuck moments as the delusions of a mentally unstable person. You know, like a Japanese chuuni, who constantly makes up stories so he can cope with his social anxiety.And here is where the movie suffers from a major tonal whiplash. On one hand the gross aspect is excused as a mental projection of how he feels. On the other hand, many of the things Manny Potter is doing cannot be excused as delusions. They actually happen in real life and makes it very hard to appreciate the psychosis of the protagonist. It's something like ""Weekend at Berie's"" where the corpse part is actually happening and the audience knows it can't be taken seriously regardless of the characters not seeing it in-story.But then the movie wants you to take it seriously towards the end without taking out the ridiculousness. You are just standing there, confused, wondering how you are supposed to react to something like this. It ends in a much more satisfactory way than it begins but not by changing into a completely different genre. It's more like a second genre mixing in and there is not much transition between the two styles, so you don't know how you are supposed to react.It could have been so much better if it wasn't as gross at first, or if it was stripping away all supernatural aspects in the last act. Yet even with those issues, it is way better than a mindless goofball comedy, and you at least get to see a cork plugging Harry Potter's ass from farting so hard, he turns into a freaking jet-ski.",Swiss Army Man
140,Ben_Cap,The Best Movie of the Year! (So Far),9,6 July 2016,"I was interested in Swiss Army Man from the first 15 seconds of the trailer, which coincidentally depicts the actual first 5 minutes of the movie. Paul Dano on a beach with a noose around his neck with only a dirty red cooler holding him up. He hums a song as he begins to make his decision to end whatever life he has left when he sees a body on the shore. Then his feet slip off the cooler. This movie is filled with moments like these, just when you think you have seen enough movies like this that you can probably write up the basic plot points based solely on memory they take it all away from you and you will thank them for the pleasure.One of the things I thought would be a hard leap to make when watching Swiss Army Man were the fantastical elements. When I saw the trailer the thing that stuck out to me most were the various ways Daniel Radcliffe's body was used to accomplish various survival techniques such as chopping wood or catching fish. I had my concerns that these moments would be relegated to a few dream sequences or something like that, but i am happy to report that the movie is full of these moments from start to finish which helps to make the movie more like a movie and less like an episode of survivor man.This movie would never have worked without two great leads to drive the movie, not only because they are primarily the only two people who actually appear in the movie, but also because their relationship is basically where the movie lies. Daniel Radcliffe is really great in what must have been a pretty difficult role, but Paul Dano is the one who really shines. For an actor with a lot of major roles, saying this one is his best in his career is not empty words. He is so fantastic in this movie, he does one of the most beautifully subtle impressions of anyone I have ever seen. While lost in the woods Paul's character does an impression of Mary Elizabeth Winstead to Daniel's character and even though she has not appeared on screen yet, I have seen her in enough things to know what Mr. Dano was going for and it was absolutely brilliant.I would be remiss if I did not mention the directors of this movie before the end of my review. Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert or simply ""Daniels"" have punched my ticket for their next film immediately. Their unique brand of film making is refreshing, and with a movie that could have gotten so out of hand and ridiculous, they found a way to control the story and their imaginations and gave us something that we could at least make some sense of. These guys certainly know what they are doing and I think they may be a few years ahead of most people.Swiss Army Man is a movie about whatever you want it to be about really. It could be a movie about friendship. It could be a movie about how wonderful and sad life is all at the same time. It could be about creativity and being yourself and original. There are probably loads more but those are for you to find out. I laughed so many times during this movie (yes even at some of the farting parts) and while the movie can briefly become emotional, there is never really time for any sort of bad feelings. This movie should be on everyone's watch list, and especially if you are looking for something to break up the big budget movies of the summer.",Swiss Army Man
141,theresamgill,"Charming, Weird, as Strange as Heck",8,12 June 2018,"I recently watched Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; both are unbelievably strange, even surreal (especially Mind), and both very well done and refined and entertaining. I won't say tonight's movie is more entertaining, but I will say it certainly is stranger. Harry Potter meets Brian Wilson-- we're somehow reviewing Swiss Army Man.
 If you watched the trailer, that gives you a good, brief overview of the absurdity that takes place. Paul Dano is stranded on an island and is about to commit suicide when a body washes ashore. It's a dead Daniel Radcliffe, but as soon as Dano returns to trying to hang himself, the weird starts happening. Perhaps it's just his imagination, more likely it's a hallucination from his starvation, but Radcliffe's body starts acting in only the ways the writers could think up while I assume certainly intoxicated. There's certainly a very juvenile aspect to his motorboat farts and regurgitated water, but enough is done to provide ample laughter that doesn't die down as much as I first assumed it would.
Dano realizes he has a chance to get back to civilization with the multi-purpose titular Radcliffe body, and this is the thread to propel the story. But if all you get or all you assume you'll get from the movie is physical comedy with a simple story of trying to return from the wilderness, then you sir aren't looking deeply at all.
As he returns back to life, Radcliffe is hilariously rude and ignorant because he doesn't remember society at all, so Dano begins teaching him. The topics of family, friends, girls, etc. is all light-hearted and fun, and it also provides the time to reflect on Dano and how he himself never totally fit in with society to begin with. It brings about a little more existential problems, and adds a couple threads to story. It's not the most developed and it doesn't have to be because that's not what the movie is. And anybody who has seen the film can and will agree with me that there's no way to say what exactly this movie is. 
Dano is charming, but the gold star goes to the derpy-smiling Daniel Radcliffe. His childish antics never loses wit and lust as he determinedly wants to learn the ways of society and how to be happy. It's surprisingly funny and endlessly charming, but it is also so incredibly strange and that is a huge reason why it never really went to mainstream theaters-- it just doesn't have that kind of audience. Really I think it's much more individual-based on who would like the film. 
I will end with the ending (no spoilers, don't worry). I've heard complaints about how it ends, and the more I have thought it through, the more I am willing to defend it. The movie ending any other way just wouldn't be fitting strangely enough. It's a jigsaw piece that doesn't match any puzzle, yet it fits in with this film. Truthfully, the only question this movie will have you asking at the end will be, ""What did I just watch?"" Take that as you may, whatever I watched, I actually enjoyed it.

142,Icedooitle,Castaweekend at Bernies,8,6 July 2016,"He's a compass, water spigot, flame thrower, Jet-Ski, grappling gun, and a SCUBA tank. You have to love the mind that thought of the most versatile character in film history, who also happens to be a corpse. There's a moment in Swiss Army Man where Hank (Paul Dano) is skipping across the sea at breakneck speed, riding the lifeless body of Daniel Radcliff (Manny) . They are propelled by the sheer power of Manny's post-mortem flatulence. There is a close-up of Radcliff's hairy ass-crack, vibrating with wind power, and I thought ""I love this, and I can't defend it."" Hank has been marooned on a deserted island for enough time to give up hope. He rethinks his suicide when a corpse rolls up on the beach. Within minutes, the farting starts and continues for the duration. You might be inclined to ask, ""What could be the possible relevance of this level of breaking wind?"" Simple, flatulence is the only sign of life a dead body can give.With the absurdity of the premise, it is admirable how touching the performances are. Hank's loneliness is so vividly established in the beginning that you encourage his relationship with any companion, even a rotting one. Paul Dano has to play a pitiable man, while performing physical comedy that doesn't undermine the desperation of his situation. He has the demanding task of being in every frame of the movie while handling all of Daniel Radcliff's physicality. It is easy to overlook the difficulty of Radcliff's role. He has no means of moving on his own and is thrashed about by his environment and Dano. This may sound like Weekend at Bernies, but he is given the ability to speak and slowly gain facial expressions. All of this has to be subtle and nuanced, lest the whole ordeal turn into a zombie comedy. Manny is more of a clean-slate character, learning humanity and all of his incredible abilities. He has a mentally deranged teacher. This allows for great moments of mirroring what he's learned where you don't know whether to laugh or sob.This is either a comedy where you are constantly second guessing your own laughter, or a drama where you turn a blind eye to great beats of humor. There will not be a general consensus of this movie's genre or quality. If you watch exclusively as a comedy, you are ignoring real depth. If you view it as any other genre, you are taking it too seriously. Therefore, you can't judge anybody for getting too little or too much out of it. You may find yourself ardently arguing for the integrity of a film that truly may not deserve it. If you take the side of praise, stick to generalities.",Swiss Army Man

The truth is, I have a doctorate degree, even and undergrad in Psychology, and I found the movie...well, it was ok. It was not the best movie I have ever seen. One thing you CAN say about this movie is, it's different. Very different.
I won't give any spoilers here other than I would suggest you watch all of it. If you pull out and give up on it, you really will miss out on an ending that pulls everything together, kinda. I kept telling my wife, this is bound to all be explained in the in and it will be nothing we expected. I was sorta right.
Alas, it does leaving you not really knowing how to react...should we laugh, should we cry, should we feel sorry for the lead guy or should we get angry at all of the people around him for not understanding? Hmmm still trying to figure some of it out. I'll let you watch and decide for yourself.

148,Darkskynet,"Manny, the angel.",8,8 December 2016,"So, through out the entire film I was convinced that Manny was a dead body and nothing more. Him returning to life was just in Hanks head. Hank clearly had a lot going on in his mind so it wasn't debatable. Then I thought, isn't that a bit clichéd? A bit obvious? I mean, it of course was my first thought and many others first as well. Perhaps this is film with fantasy elements. Why can't Manny come back to life?There was apart of me that wanted to clarify the ending of Manny being a fixture of Hanks mind. Someone to say, 'look, mate, you've been ill for a long time, lonely and lost... you made a friend'. And another part that wanted Manny to suddenly speak up, get up, walk away like nothing happened. The bittersweet ending, did leave you questioning Hanks mind and the reality of the film. I felt that Manny jet skiing back into the water was to help another lost soul on an island and Manny was an angel of some kind. I mean, Manny was a survival tool for Hank to help get back home and ultimately keep him alive. Overall, the film tied in really well together. The music and acting was great and I did feel some relief and happiness when Hank was home. So, on that note, it's an 8/10.",Swiss Army Man

It set out to tackle something so simple and it almost nailed it, but this film's ultimate downfall was the mysticism. I hated the magic powers that Daniel Radcliffe's character had. Not only was it stupid, it was used for comedy that simply wasn't funny, it was eye rolling. Also, there were some pointless elements included that should've been removed and also the ending felt so awkward and unfulfilling, they really could've worked on that more. I feel like the filmmakers really had a vision, one that could've worked if they simply removed the slapstick comedy aspect and maybe have rewritten the script a few times. The direction and the music was good for the most part. I really wanted to love this film, but I don't. I rate Swiss Army Man a 5/10.",Swiss Army Man
150,PennyForMyThoughts,Strong beginning,7,17 March 2019,"I thought that this movie started off great, it's an extremely original concept and the surreal dark humor really helped drive the story.It told the story of the anxiety caused by a modern existence in a nuanced and almost whimsically dark manner that I was really enjoying.I was fully convinced that we were witnessing the absurd fantasy of a troubled young man trying to cope with his life and shortcomings and that it was even perhaps the ""life flashing before his eyes"" that he referenced in the opening scene and perhaps his initial suicide attempt was actually successful.Up until the final act I would have rated this film an 8 or a 9, but beginning with the bear scene at the end they really started laying on the nihilism thickly and they in some ways broke a fourth wall of sorts with the final scene by grounding the whole story in reality rather than leaving it open to interpretation.I think that it could have ended much more cleanly, only involving the two main characters and it would have been a better film for it.Having said that, I still give this film a 7 for great acting and great originality. This is a film that certainly isn't going to be for everyone, but also one you won't forget quickly.",Swiss Army Man

I wasn't at all sure what to expect, but because of Radcliffe and Dano, I decided to give it a try.It's inspired.If your'e going to watch it for a comedy, then don't (although it has many funny moments). If your'e going to watch it for a mystery, then don't (although it is truly mysterious). If your'e going to watch it for its foresight into the many aspects of the human conditioning about what we perceive as wrong, right or otherwise in situations of day to day life - then expect a real eye opener in a way you may never have dreamed possible.I'm genuinely surprised that it has received the high rating it has, because I suspect many viewers will find it baffling, boring, or simply disgusting. Some maybe will think it's all three.Thankfully however, the world has many different people with many different tastes, and even more thankfully there are people out there making movies that are so different that there really is something out there for everyone.This ones for me and hopefully, for some other like-minded individuals.Wonderful.",Swiss Army Man
152,dbs630-697-952794,w. t. f.? Perfect last words,1,7 February 2017,"Perfect last line of the film. That was about the summation of this absolute abomination of a film. I never watched a preview never knew anything about this movie until I turned it on. At first I thought it was going to be a movie like ""Castaway"" that showed some textbook uses for a corpse in survival (shedding light on the wasted pilots bodies that Tom Hanks buries). Wow was I wrong. My second thought about a half hour in was that maybe he was on some Pacific island where he would come across some WWII ruins to add to the story and that he was perhaps just loosing his marbles to a corpse friend. Then about an hour in I started to wonder how a man lost on a deserted isle (as the description states) could have enough strength to hump around a bloated decomposing body that probably weighed over 200 lbs. Not to mention how he could drink the bile that came out of his mouth and not vomit at the very smell. How is it that he wasn't waking up to a body covered in crabs every morning? Or seagulls? Then it finally came about 20 minutes from the end. He's a homeless mentally ill stalker who's been camping out behind his victims house stealing their trash and making crafts with it. What could have been the making of a great suspense thriller was wasted on fart and boner gags and just flat out duping the audience to watch it for the first hour and a half by lying to them and not in an ironic good plot structure way but just by confusing us to death. In my opinion the best part about the movie was the woman's reaction at the very end. ""Wtf?""",Swiss Army Man
153,ilikeweirdstuffs,Not everything that's bitter is medicine. Some is s**t.,1,5 September 2017,"Dear person reading this, I am writing this so that those who see this review may know that there are still other sane people out there and the world isn't as hopeless and doomed as the people praising this dumpster fire make it seem. Other movies only manage to be worse if they cater to the gross- horror / torture porn crowd. They thus usually limit themselves in scope and audience, and thus damage potential, to people who are willing to watch such movies.So while it is not aggressively trying to hurt the viewer, this movie is still absolutely awful in that it first appears to be ""just weird"", while in actuality possibly being the worst high profile movie mankind has ever produced, certainly on par with Tusk and co.The movie lacks any redeeming qualities. The story is vapid, the score at best disturbing and fittingly nauseating, the setting atrocious, the visuals bland, the message non-existent. While good actors might have saved other movies, this one was so bad that the actors are tainted by it instead. The lead, Dano, was trying his best, and has a sympathetic face, but i will probably never be able to watch anything from him or Radcliffe ever again, because of the association with this movie.This movie is merely trying to assault the viewer's senses, hoping that in the confusion the poor victim will be unable to differentiate the uneasy feeling of seeing revolting things from the feeling of having profound wisdom revealed to them. Well the emperor has no clothes as others have said. There is absolutely nothing profound about this movie.I have only spoilered this review with the mentally handicapped audience in mind, but most of the ending is already revealed if one looks close enough at the trailer: The talking corpse of infinite farts, water, and machine gun skills in an otherwise realistic world cannot possibly be realistic. So it's not really a plot twist as it is clear from the trailer on. And that's about it. This is basically the profound wisdom everyone is talking about. Ooooh the supernatural corpse isn't a real thing, he only imagines it living, so the things the corpse does only come from his imagination! What a stellar metaphor for random things about life! It's just one step away from actually having the main character just talk to himself about his problems throughout the whole movie. The values people ascribe to the movie are just not present no matter how positively i try to look at things. Statement about modern life? Where? A critique of what is and isn't acceptable? So are you saying your profound wisdom is that constant talk about masturbation and random private bodily functions in company should be commonplace? A cautionary tale against intolerance in general? Does that include the scene of the bible being smeared with feces for shock value?Here is a tip for all the people who would go on and give this movie any rating above 5 stars: Instead of buying this movie, the next time you use the toilet, don't flush and put your head into it for 97 minutes while pretending that it is a symbolic gesture about the stink of the modern, industrial, densely populated world, the value that individuals produce being independent of societal norms, and the conditions of our fellow man. You will get the same nauseating disgust and smug self-satisfaction as you would from watching this abomination and then pretending that a movie made explicitly to ""make unpalatable things palatable"" carried a deep message for you.""Artist's Sh*t"" (mierda de l'artista) as an art piece at least had value in that it was self aware and meta in criticizing its own future. This movie completely lacks self awareness, and is nonetheless - bar a few good cinematic moves - essentially of the same content as the previously mentioned work of art.",Swiss Army Man
154,BecauseIAmBATMAN,Creatively mind-blowing,9,24 September 2016,"One of the most insanely creative and original film ever. Its often strange with crude humour about farting corpses and boners, but there certainly is a deeper meaning to it rather than being crudeness for the sake of it. This film is truly a magical experience that dares to defy conventions. Its a thought provoking film that would make you question our conventions and need to be normal while exploring loneliness. With beautiful cinematography, powerful performances by Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe, well paced with an excellent soundtrack this certainly is my favourite film of the year (so far). Its certainly not everyone, it wouldn't be surprising if most people dismissed it saying 'What the hell'.

156,ralo229,A Film You Have to See to Believe,8,1 November 2016,"If you read the premise on IMDb, then I think it's easy to assume that this movie is about as weird as it sounds. If there's one word to describe Swiss Army Man, it's strange. The story is strange. The characters are strange. The jokes are strange. But, amazingly, that's what gives the film some of its charm and likability.Paul Dano, who gave great performances in films like 12 Years a Slave, Prisoners, and Love and Mercy, very well portrays a lonely and hopeless man who doesn't believe he deserves any rewards in life. Daniel Radcliffe, who you obviously know from the Harry Potter series, also convincingly plays a dead body who almost acts like a curious little kid that just wants to know how the world works. The two share a surprisingly good chemistry. Yes. A lonely guy and a talking corpse share surprisingly good chemistry. Never thought I'd ever say that.The film also has its own sense of heart and humor. And kinda like I said earlier about the film itself being strange, I don't say that lightly. The touching moments and the funny moments are so weird and so unlike anything that I've ever seen in any movie, that I can't help but either chuckle at them or feel touched by them.Where this film falls flat is its pacing. Despite the fact that the film was only an hour and a half long, it felt about an hour longer. Certain scenes between Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe dragged on for a little too long. In all fairness, most of these slow scenes are supposed to help further both characters, but at the same time, it really makes you question if there was some other alternative where the script can still achieve that same goal without boring the audience to tears. But these scenes were pretty few and far between, so I guess it only counts as a nitpick.So is it for everyone? Probably not. This is a film that you're either gonna love or hate. Many might see this as genius. Others might see it as the stupidest goddamn thing you've ever seen in your entire life. And either side is understandable. I can't really tell you whether this film is good or bad. It's just simply one of those movies that you have to see to believe.8/10",Swiss Army Man
157,The_Film_Auditor,Incredibly Underrated Original Film,10,17 July 2018,"Swiss Army Man is a movie best summarized by a quote from the directors: ""The first fart will make you laugh, the last fart will make you cry."" The film tells the story of Hank Thompson, a depressed man stranded on an island whose life is changed when he discovers a dead body with the ability to aid him in survival. The film follows Hank and Manny (the dead body) as they develop a friendship and discover what makes life worth living.The first five minutes of the film are a bit silly and weird, but once you get used to the concept, the film turns into a beautiful story of friendship. The movie is not afraid to play around with its tone. Sometimes the film feels fun and hilarious, filled with montages and music. Other moments take a more serious tone, commenting on bullying, social norms, and suicide. Surprisingly, this works very well.On a technical level, Swiss Army Man is beautiful to both listen and look at. The soundtrack for the film, written by Andy Hull and Robert McDowell, is used beautifully to capture the emotions of the characters. The cinematography is vibrantly shot, utilizing reds, blues, and greens to compose wonderful visuals. Even the set design is delightful despite the film taking place primarily in the woods.Both Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe give fantastic performances. Dano and Radcliffe have terrific chemistry, making their characters' relationship feel genuine. Radcliffe is hilarious as a dead body. What he does with his face and body is impressive; he makes himself look dead, but still full of emotion. Their performances are what drives the movie and makes this ridiculous concept work.Despite making fart and dick jokes, the film is not afraid to comment on topics such as conformity, exclusion, self-love, and being yourself. This film is best seen blind. The trailer does not give justice to this wonderfully original, touching film.The Good

158,manisimmati,A Relentlessy Wacky Buddy Movie,8,6 August 2017,"A suicidal man named Hank is stranded on a lonely island. There he meets the corpse Manny who's suffering from terrible flatulence. Hank uses the dead body and its farts to cross the ocean. (Don't ask.) They reach a jungle, where a struggle for survival begins. Hank realizes that Manny is kinda like a human Swiss army knife. He uses him as a hunting weapon, a grapple and a compass. (Yeah. Don't ask.) But Manny only functions when he gets motivated properly. So the world-worn Hank needs to teach the corpse how beautiful life actually is.Yes. This seriously is the plot of ""Swiss Army Man"", an off-kilter and juvenile adventure movie full of fart and masturbation jokes. The two directors Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan (""Daniels"") display a crude humor, which definitively isn't for everyone. But if you give this movie a chance and make it through the clunky first act, you might realize that the plot has more to offer than just trash madness. It's actually a rather sad story about a depressed and lonely young man trying to find himself. There are some really inspiring and beautiful montages, that are technically impressive as well.The relationship between Hank and Manny is the heart of this movie. The two leads have an amazing chemistry going on. Paul Dano (""There Will Be Blood"") is very relatable, because he is just as astonished about the strange circumstances as the audience is. Daniel Radcliffe (""Harry Potter"") has an impeccable comedic timing: His Manny is one of the funniest characters I have seen in a long time. The relationship between Hank and Manny lends itself to interpretation: Are they friends, a homosexual couple or ego and alter ego? But of course you shouldn't overthink ""Swiss Army Man"", because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie ends with a flabbergasted Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"") whispering: ""What the f***?""

165,horitaj,"""If you don't know Jurassic Park, you don't know s#*@.""",9,15 July 2016,"""Swiss Army Man"" stars Paul Dano (Hank) and Daniel Radcliffe (Manny), and is the directorial debut by the talented duo known as Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert). The film premiered at Sundance where it was awarded the best dramatic director award and was met with many walk outs during the screenings.As you most likely know Paul Dano is stranded on an island and Daniel Radcliffe's dead flatulent body just so happens to wash up on the island, and is a ""multi purpose tool guide"" for Dano to use in an attempt to get home to civilization. While on their journey home Manny (Radcliffe) doesn't remember a single thing about his previous life and life at all for that matter and seeks knowledge through Hank (Dano) as they talk about masturbation, farting, and love. As silly as it may sound ""Swiss Army Man"" is a very thought provoking film that tackles subjects about freedom, what it means to be truly free, and what's normal and weird/good and bad/appropriate and inappropriate. ""Swiss Army Man"" attacks what society may see as the norm and makes it abnormal in this film between Hank and Manny. This film is nothing like you've ever seen before, it's holy original and has a strong message that no other film has brought up before.Paul Dano is flawless as the character of Hank, and plays it so well with a sense of reality while spicing it up with unintentional comedy. Radcliffe gives the performance of his career as a dead person and pulls it off so so well with such subtlety. This is such a major leap from Harry Potter for Radcliffe and I can see him taking on even more unusual and unique roles in the future. Both the characters play off each other so beautifully and this is due to great direction by the Daniels, and the wonderful chemistry between Dano and Radcliffe.The only issue that I have with the film is its conclusion. There are so many things happening so quickly that it was very hard for me to take it all in. Plus the film has a hard time finding where to end. (My opinion).""Swiss Army Man"" is a film that takes many chances that are pulled off so beautifully and introduces the debut of the Daniels as one of the most unique set of filmmakers to come in recent years. Go out and support this film because it deserves all the attention it's getting.Now I just have one thing to say. For those who walked out of the theater during screenings of this film demonstrate how our culture does not appreciate art. For a film to be so unique and original (especially in this age of remakes, reboots, and films just made for money) I find it very sad that people don't support art and would rather have films made with no effort just to make a steep profit. People need to support films that are unique and take a chance for the sake of art. That's the reason why I love the production company A24. A24 produces films that are not main stream, they produce films that are original, unique, and independent. A24 produced ""Spring Breakers"" (2013), ""Green Room"" (2016), ""The Witch"" (2016), and ""The Rover"" (2014). A24 is preserving and making films that are independent and creative; they are the symbol of art in the film production world. I will buy anything with A24's name on it.",Swiss Army Man

When a body washes up on the coast just a moment before he finally kicks the bucket, he suddenly finds a friend, a boat of a sort, and later a romantic interest. Their journey takes them trough a lot of new and past experiences. A movie like this one would never work if you dont have strong actors, in the two leading roles with good charisma and professional chemistry between them. Radcliffe and Dano are doing an awesome job and seem like the perfect casting choices for the movie. With their future film debut the Daniels bet on one of the weirdest screenplays ever written. The film tries to balance between the macabre character of its premise and the idea that love could save us even in the most difficult situations. The message of the story is that we should embrace our nature and be more open minded when it comes to already established ideas about what is to be in love and to be alive. My issues with the film are the lack of diversity in the locations. Besides from the opening scene on the coast, a river crossing and of course the wonderfully edited bus scene the movie is sort of dull when it comes to its locations with dirt and trees dominating almost all of the screen time. The humorous and a bit supernatural abilities of Radcliffs body dont bother me, but i just wish that Danos character could be something more than a boy with a crush for the girl on the bus. As an experimental piece the movie is a success. Its themes of necrophilia and using the body of a death man as a vehicle and a tool angered a lot of viewers which is always a desirable characteristic for a provoking film, like this one. Ultimately i think its a fresh story, with perhaps too much comedy for my personal taste, but nonetheless a good amount of charm and good work behind it.",Swiss Army Man

I found Daniel Radcliffe was hilarious in this movie and Paul Dano did his part disturbingly well. Although the actors did very well, what it was achieving was strange. It was queasy humour. Lots of laugh our loud moments. Nevertheless, at the end of the movie, it is memorable for all the wrong reasons. Will I recommend this movie? Maybe, if you have come as far as reading this review, then you could as well watch it. Daniel Radcliffe is fantastic. He has done something rather difficult with aplomb.

They say playing a dead person is the most difficult role an actor can take on, and Daniel did an astounding job. He actually LOOKED dead at the beginning.

Radcliff is quite acceptable in the role of Manny, which was very physically demanding in its way.Some reviewers here think the movie is ""deep.""

That said, I absolutely loved ""Swiss Army Man"", which is essentially one very long fart joke! Go figure.""Swiss Army Man"" is a vibrant, creative, youthful, Surrealist film that left me speechless for a bit. It is the story of a man (Paul Dano) who has given up on life, but then finds a corpse (Daniel Radcliff), a very flatulent corpse. Trapped on a deserted island, the narrator uses the corpse to escape, and makes his way to what appears to be the US Pacific Northwest. From there, he hikes through the woods, working his way back to civilization, carting the corpse, all the while discovering the corpse is useful in more ways than one. He also discovers that the more he uses the corpse, the more animated and brought back to life, the corpse becomes. As they journey together, they discuss life, the universe, and everything and the lines between teacher and pupil get increasingly fuzzy.What makes ""Swiss Army Man"" standout, besides a clever script and two outstanding performances by the leads, is its brilliant editing. It uses time lapse photography in a unique manner. The sets are astonishing, works of art really, made of refuse and twigs, captured through a series of disjointed and confusing stills and clips, with flashes of the past tossed in for good measure. For everyone who has ever felt sad, alone, or alienated from society, then this film is for you. I think this movie might be one of the most overlooked films of the year.",Swiss Army Man

Through a series of odd and spectacular events, the body comes to life and the two go on a ""road trip"" of epic proportions to get Hank back home.The score for this film, while simplistic, is by far the most inventive I've heard in years.

In a nutshell, a suspension of disbelief is essential for this movie, which allows the incredibly creative canvas The Daniels built to sink in. The plot is an exploration of the reality of existence, isolation, sex and desire, death, and survival. That it's done with slapstick, lowbrow and black comedy engages the open-minded viewer, and if you're not easily offended, it never bores or loses interest. I found myself laughing frequently, not at the easy gas jokes, but at the acerbic and observational situations presented, and the character's unlikely reactions to them; there is a level of intelligent insight that wouldn't work in a realistic film. Both actors do great work in a difficult environment, but Radcliffe really hits a home run with his portrayal, both physically and emotionally; I'm impressed that he would choose a movie like this, and that he threw himself so fully into the role. That last comment goes for both actors, because without their level of commitment to their roles this movie could have easily been a failure.

184,zachmoats,Hell of a directorial debut for Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan,8,25 March 2017,"Swiss Army Man is a wild, immature, self-aware, mature, intellectual, uncomfortable, hilarious ride. Yes, I purposely put those contradictory words in there. It's for those reasons that long after seeing Swiss Army Man, I am still breaking down everything I watched.It's a weird, but seemingly basic (see: traditional, as there isn't much ""basic"" about being stranded) premise of a man being lost and trying to find his way back home. As we find out, home is not that simple, and it turns out that things can get weird when corpses come back to life. Paul Dano (Hank) and Daniel Radcliffe (Manny) are cast perfectly for this film. However, it's the writing and directing team of Daniel Scheinert and Dan Kwan that I wanted to focus on. I think the writing in the film is really good. It preserves a lot of mystery without taking over the story. The audience remains curious about certain aspects of the film, but not enough that it takes away from their enjoyment of scenes like the party that Hank and Manny have together. The direction was really solid too. Other than the beautiful use of natural light and incorporation of the environment, I thought the sparing use of slow motion was a really nice touch. Overall, I really can't wait to see what this duo takes on for their next feature length project. If you don't mind a lot of fart jokes, you should definitely check this out! Actually, even if you do, because I still think it's worth it. The farting didn't do too much for me either, and look at how much I enjoyed the whole thing!",Swiss Army Man
185,cinemacy,"Much more than just fart jokes, 'Swiss Army Man' is deep & unpredictable",8,27 January 2016,"Usually, fart jokes are associated with bad raunchy comedies in the likes of Adam Sandler's recent career, or really uncreative family movies. Insert, 'Swiss Army Man' – the Sundance title that's generated the most vocal reaction amongst festival goers for it's ridiculous, now infamous, farting dead body played by Daniel Radcliffe. This is only how the film begins, and let's just say it toots even louder from there.Paul Dano plays Hank, a man lost on an island. Right when he's about to give up on life, he discovers the aforementioned farting body and finds an unexpected answer to why his life is worth living. He discovers that many elements of this body can help him survive and find a way back home, and keeps himself sane (or perhaps insane) by talking to it.The writer/director duo Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as ""the Daniels"", have a reputation for ridiculous and highly entertaining short films and music videos, and this feature represents a conglomerate of numerous ideas that sound bad yet somehow all work. As Hank develops a relationship with the dead body (one that starts out similar to Wilson in Cast Away), the intriguing absurdity keeps you engaged for the rest of the film. This is the type of film best seen with little information beyond the initial premise, as it is full of mystery boxes waiting to be unraveled. Thanks to the great use of locations and production design, the world- building is fantastic and the wackiness becomes downright fun.On top of being a silly movie that doesn't pretend to take itself seriously, 'Swiss Army Man' sneaks in themes of societal behavior and what is considered weird vs. what is normal. It's rare to find a movie that is so unpredictable in an engaging way, and because the movie begins with something so ridiculous and only goes deeper from there, it allows for limitless ideas on what is going to happen next and continues to be fun to watch. The reason the film may be polarizing is because of how silly it all is, but going in knowing it will be this way is all you need to jump in and enjoy the show. There is little more to say without giving too much away – essentially, if you can accept absurdity and be along for the ride, this movie may just sneak up and treat you to a great time overall.For more, visit: www.cinemacy.com",Swiss Army Man
186,GRWeston,"""If you don't know Jurassic Park, you don't know s***!""",8,12 June 2017,"Better known as the ""farty boner corpse"" movie, this is a strange, funny and surprisingly heartwarming buddy comedy starring Paul Dano as Hank, a depressed man whose suicide attempt is interrupted by a corpse that washes ashore. Hank uses the corpse, which he dubs Manny (a very good Daniel Radcliffe) to escape his desert island and return home. The movie makes a strong argument that the smartphone- addicted culture of the 2010's is turning too many of us into people like Hank, a man who is ashamed of his eccentricities, oddities and everything else that social media allows us to mask all too easily. During his travels with Manny, who exhibits everything disgusting about human beings, he learns to not be embarrassed of his abnormalities, because when it comes down to it, humans are pretty weird by design. The movie has been compared to everything from Cast Away to Weekend at Bernie's to Where the Wild Things Are, but the comparison that makes the most sense to me is Rain Man. In that movie, Charlie regains the humanity that Reaganomics stole from him, and in this one, Hank regains the humanity that smartphone culture told him to revile. While its life-affirming message it shares with some of the other movies I mentioned is not terribly original, the odd, disgusting and definitely unique journey Hank and Manny go on is still worth joining.",Swiss Army Man

188,madfashionista,"A Crazy, Sweet, Unexpectedly Emotional Movie. A Wild Ride!",10,30 December 2016,"TL:DR (RECAP & REVIEW) This crazy, sweet, deep movie, replete with farts and boners, is the best movie I have seen for years. Not only is it very funny, it's surprisingly deep and emotional. Paul Dano as Hank and Daniel Radcliffe as dead Manny are spectacular. There is tremendous chemistry between the two actors, who are pretty much the whole show until the end. Daniels, the directors, use deliberately low-tech effects (and a real bear) to ground the film in physical reality. Instead of the CGI many other filmmakers use. In an interview, Radcliffe said the film is not fantasy, it's magical realism. Which is a great description.The soundtrack is a Capella. Andrew Hull of Manchester Orchestra layers the soundtrack with dozens of voices played over each other the only other instruments percussion made with sticks and leaves. Not only that, Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe sing quite a bit of the score. The first thing we say is trash bobbing in the water, with the words HELP ME and MY BOAT WAS CAUGHT IN A STORM. One toy boat is made out of garbage, prefiguring Hank's ability to create environments and creatures out of found materials.Stranded on a desert island, Hank is about to commit suicide when a corpse washes up on the beach. When he discovers the man is dead, Hank goes to kill himself again. But the corpse starts farting, and the farts propel the corpse through the water. Hank grabs a robe, jumps on the corpse and rides him like a jet-ski. At this point, the credits come up, and goddamn if it that isn't a perfect way to introduce something that asks so much of your imagination.Hank labors to get home, the dead man strapped to his back. To keep the corpse from farting, Hank finds a cork (We don't see what happens next.) The dead man, named Manny, slowly comes to life. He has magical powers, such as a boner that can be used as a compass. Daniel Radcliffe has to do 75% of his acting using only his face and eyes. Since Manny is dead, he can't move of his own volition from the neck down. (This results in a lot of priceless slapstick.) Manny is slurred and slow, becoming more articulate as the film goes on. Hank is caught up in teaching Manny what the world is, what love is, what feelings are. Paul Dano excels at playing a man who would be seen as a isolated introvert, but Manny, in a sense, brings Hank to life. Manny sees a picture of a beautiful woman on Hank's cell phone, Sarah and declares that's why they have to get 'home'. Hank and Manny's friendship becomes a bond, and possibly a romantic one, as Hank dresses as ""Sarah"" to try to jog Manny's memory of his life. He reenacts the only flashback we see, Hank sitting on the bus, alone. Only this time, Hank dresses as Sarah, leading Manny through sitting next to ""Sarah"" and holding her hand.Sarah/Hank blend more as the story goes along. Manny is in love with Sarah, and with Hank. As he says, ""maybe love is bringing me to life"". Hank creates a world for them to live in, with a sort of house, a car, even a makeshift bus. One night, they both get drunk and throw a ""party"". Hank helps Manny to dance by making puppet strings out of vines for him and acting as the puppeteer. Manny demands to talk to Sarah. Hank puts on the wig, and leans to kiss Manny, who falls over. They put it down to intoxication. Later in the film, Hank crawls across a water pipe, Manny strapped to his back. Manny feels there's a barrier between them, that Hank needs to say something. Hank cuts him off; but the pipe they're on breaks and they are plunged into the river far below. Underwater, Hank sees Manny drifting down into the water. Hank swims down, grabs Manny, and kisses him. This is interspersed with shots of ""Sarah"" and Manny echoing Hank's gestures. Manny is happy, and air pours out of his mouth. Hank realizes it, and continues to kiss him, the quiet sound of breathing the only thing we hear as they drift downward into the darkness. Then the cork comes bobbing to the surface. As the triumphant ""River Rocket"" song plays, they fly up into the air, ecstatic.There's still a lot that happens, but I'm going to skip it. At the end, Hank and Manny reach ""home"", the backyard of the woman whose picture is on Hank's phone. She's married, with a kid, and is completely freaked to see a disheveled man and a corpse on her lawn. Manny is again dead. Has he been dead this whole time? Has this all taken place in Hank's brain? I choose to believe it's real. The suburban setting and all that follows is a jarring transition from the rest of the movie and doesn't work. The ending is deeply unsatisfying. The protagonists are separated for good, and Hank is again alone. Whether or not you choose to see that as a good or bad thing is up to you. It left a very bad taste in my mouth.But this is a great movie by any measure, and unlike anything you've seen.",Swiss Army Man

Heart and emotion pours through in unorthodox ways that never feels anything but genuine. The humour, although would typically be seen as vulgar and juvenile amongst society, isn't off-putting; it doesn't take anything away from the film and adds to the candid and human nature of the narrative. Despite Swiss Army Man's fantastical elements, it provides realism and social commentary on the constructs and ideologies that have been placed upon us in society, as well as human thoughts, emotions, and connections. But it's the way it's handled and presented that I applaud most; it never feels pretentious or forced, it always feel sincere and focused on where it's going. The soundtrack/score is something that really stands out throughout the entirety of the film; it's beautiful and well incorporated, it perfectly balances the drama and heart. Directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert told Dano they wanted to make a movie where ""the first fart makes you laugh and the last fart makes you cry"", and, as weird as that sounds, I can tell you, that's exactly what they did - and so effortlessly, too. Swiss Army Man will make you laugh, will make you cry, will make you think.

Never laughed once but I did find it light hearted.Secondly, the only reason this film gets 6/10 from me and not 1/10 is because of the amazing acting. The script sucks, the photography and editing is not much better... but the acting is very good.Now onto the film...SPOILER? Hank was never on a desert island. It should be obvious at the end of the film that this was the case. The island is a metaphor for Hank's loneliness and he has chosen to kill himself in the woods near the home of the woman who has captured his imagination when Manny washes up on the shore. The entire film is about Hank's mental breakdown brought on by his loneliness and longing for the woman of his affection... and he never traveled anywhere with the body, it was all in his mind.",Swiss Army Man

192,Alex-Siddhi,We all need some body to lean on.,9,10 October 2016,"A truly remarkable piece of modern surrealism, Swiss Army Man takes us on an adventure that we probably haven't experienced before. It does not mess around with any long introduction process, almost right from the beginning we are dropped into a bizarre story that involves a suicidal cast-away and a corpse that can fart like a high powered jet- ski – played by Daniel Radcliffe of course.But this is more than just a surreal film about a guy losing his mind from being stranded on an island, this film explores emotions and feelings that we hide from others, can relate to and dread to think of happening to us, this is done through immensely good and tight editing and beautiful mixes of music. There are scenes that become intense from quick flashes of what has happened and memories, but sometimes these images are altered so it is like we are remembering things differently to how they actually happened, this is good for psychological reasons because everyone interprets things differently.After Paul Dano's character, Hank tries to kill himself from being stranded on an island for some unexplained reason, he meets the corpse; Manny who helps him find himself rather than find his home, he ascends on a journey of pain, fear, hallucination, starvation, isolation but also self awareness, freedom, morality and strength.Hank is a young man who appears to be an outcast in society, someone who has failed at something and dares not to try again, full of self pity and loathing, but with this there is hope for his character, after all he seems like a nice guy who teaches his new friend Manny who is dead but is learning about life, people, difficulty, emotions, and after becoming more alive he begins to attain abilities that engage their journey in literally explosive ways.I liked how throughout the movie I did not know how or where this film was going, but I was never bored of the mysteries of the plot and I was always excited to see what would happen next. It has the theme of wondering if things are imaginary or really happening; supernatural versus delusion.This film explores and experiments with the stranger themes in film, and it exposes and accelerates what our imagination is capable of as artists, as film makers and film lovers, it brings out raw and deep emotions and thoughts within us if you let it.I give this curious, imaginative, creative & strange but free film a 9 out of 10.",Swiss Army Man

That being said after finally watching the film I can't believe how great it was. This is not a perfect 10/10 film but its crazy good. Daniel Radcliffe's character is stupid af and yet I fell in love with him. Paul Dano was also great but Daniel blew me away (with his farts). This film is about Paul who is stuck on an island about to kill himself discovers a body (Radcliffe) and slowly brings him back to life. Pauls character was dead on the inside and by showing Daniel how great life can be he himself begins to come back to life. The story takes place on an island and in a forest/jungle and they make their way back to civilization. What these two characters go through together enriches their friendship and surprisingly it moves us even with some ridiculous premises. The music in the film is amazing and the performances are fantastic. I may be praising the film only because it shouldn't have worked and not only did it work but it exceeded that.

However it's hard to stomach movies that resort to a constant overlay of ""weird music"" to make things seem edgy or profound.I'm 15mins in and it's been almost nothing but a constant orchestral overlay of Paul Dano humming or singing children's tunes.How the Director failed to notice that his voice in that capacity is like nails on a damn chalkboard I'll never know.
If they wanted to make a movie about descent into madness on an island in a serious or funny way they didn't need to have it done to the constant children's orchestral lullaby of PAUL DANOS VOICE.It distracts and offputs everything. It's a compelling movie but the constant break of immersion due to this hideous sound track is atrocious.",Swiss Army Man

What might get lost in the mix is how impressively this unique and uncompromised debut feature can be seen through completely opposite lenses.One way of responding to SWiSS ARMY MAN could be to contagiously laugh at the screwball actions of Hank (Paul Dano), a man stranded on a desert island with a dead body (Daniel Radcliffe). Another way would be to question Hank's reliability as a narrator and view this surreal, spiritual spiral as an existential journey into complete madness. Either way, Daniel Radcliffe's performance as a dead body is the kind of profound achievement you might expect from a Harold Pinter or Samuel Beckett play.Swiss Army Man is not just the most infamous film at Sundance this year; It is the perfect Hollywood calling card for first time filmmakers Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinart, as well as being a completely neo-sincere film. Movie lovers should put aside all of its buzz and just experience it for themselves.

When I saw the first few trailers I fell in love with the soundtrack, which I then listened to a lot. But the quirkiness reeled me in and it became number one on my 'TO WATCH' list. Of course, like every movie i set out to watch, i couldn't find the time to do so. After waiting such a long time, it did not disappoint. It was good to the eyes and the mind. The music makes so much more sense now, it fits perfectly. The movie was made for the music and the music was made for the movie, it made me feel emotional throughout. Paul Dano was excellent in it, and so was Daniel Radcliffe; who's probably one of the few actors who can pull of a role like this. The only thing that bothered me sometimes was the 'deepness', which got a little too much some times. Maybe it was ironic and done on purpose and i just might have overlooked it. In the end this movie is of course not a masterpiece, but it's certainly an instant cult hit. A lot of people will talk about this movie, whether they dislike it or like it.",Swiss Army Man

Watch ""Cast Away"" (or anything else) instead!",2,27 January 2018,"Without spoiling anything that's not in the synopsis, the film opens with our main character on a desert island, about to hang himself out of desperation -- when a dead body suddenly washes up on shore and causes him to reconsider. Okay... that was unexpected and I wanted to see where this was going. As the film's upbeat opening credits montage rolls, we see that the dead guy provides our protagonist with an unexpected use. By this point, I was already guessing that based on the film's title, the dead man would provide other survival-related functions, a bit like a Swiss Army Knife. Cool. Okay, so that having been established, what's next? Well, as it happens, not a whole lot. And that's a shame.As a 10-minute short film, SAM could have worked -- but as a feature-length film, it just drags and drags. I'd already read some reviews, including the one in my local (major city) newspaper, and was aware this film wasn't for everyone. But the paper's respected reviewer gave this film 3 stars out of 4 and closed by saying, ""all bets are off as to where this story is headed. But it's impossible not to get caught up in it, even if you're simultaneously repelled by it."" -- though after the 20-minute mark, that couldn't be any *further* from the truth. After enduring the film first 30 minutes and wondering ""Is this going somewhere?"" (the protagonist wasn't), we gave it another 10 minutes, then agreed to switch it off. And that's something we very rarely do -- like once or twice every 5 years, maybe.The next day, having looked through the ""Ordered By: Helpfulness"" reviews here on IMDb and seen so many high ratings and positive reviews , I decided to continue the movie, solo. I'm open minded, and no, I wasn't repulsed. But I also wasn't amused, entertained, or interested in any of the characters. I didn't find it at all ""intelligent"", as I'd seen some reviewers say, I didn't find anything redeeming about it, other than those first few opening minutes.Without spoiling the ending, the last 13 minutes of the film are so contrived that if you weren't already saying ""This is stupid!"", then you have no excuse not to be now. And not surprisingly, the movie even ends with a fizzle.Is Swiss Army Man unique? Sure. Is it worth watching? Most definitely not.

I have seen many films that reuse the same lines and usually the same plot, sometimes to the point where only minor visuals could tell apart the movies. This movie is one of the crafts that actually is new and introduces a special part of imagination that provokes interest, emotion, and revisiting of some of life ideals that other films either can't get or could dimly clinch. The movie itself starts off a bit dull, and almost lost me. I know it is just like music, some great parts are introduced after you hear few starting notes. Patience does pay off in these instances.

I wont describe the plot cause it will probably put you off, just trust me, this film is amazing. First of all Swiss Army Man is one of the most beautiful looking movies i've ever seen. Its just so gorgeous, every shot was a treat to look at. Another amazing thing was the score. It fitted the film perfectly and is so full of energy and joy, just like the film its self. Probably the best part of the movie though were the two leads. I'm a big fan of movies with small casts and Swiss Army Man only has two character who are both incredible well performed by Paul Dano and Danial Radcliffe who are both excellent. Its also really funny and parts will have you laughing like hell but other parts will have you on the verge of crying. The humor is so well done, It takes jokes that will usually make people cringe and feel dumb and nothing more, and with amazing writing become incredibly funny and relatable.

This movie is so much more than just fart jokes, and if you think that you can see past those then it is really an amazing movie that you should watch right now. Paul Dano and Daniel Radcliffe's performances were great, the cinematography was very pleasing and definitely exceeded my expectations, and just the ride and rush of feelings and emotions that we as an audience are put through is just unforgettable. At 97 minutes long, this movie does not waste a single second of it's runtime, especially not the ending, which is a fantastic one and gives you something to think about afterwards.I'm glad I watched this movie, despite the negative feedback it got from a bunch of people, and after reading my review I hope I convinced you to watch it too, you will not regret it.",Swiss Army Man

But don't let the last part put you off. This movie has a lot of heart. It's a clever idea. And the filmmakers should be commended for definitely thinking outside the box.

I remember thinking at the time that it was a wonderfully imaginative movie that would never ever make it to the theater but I just saw an MPAA trailer released for it so it looks like it might just happen. This is one of those films that is so bizarre that it is hard to really talk much about it without sounding insane or giving too much away. It's really just a film you have to decide to see and then let it unfold. I feel like it's an early film Michel Gondry would have made and the directors (Daniel Scheinert and Daniels Kwan, aka ""The Daniels"") do such a great job putting this film together. It's no wonder they won the prize for Directing though there was some blow-back at the festival as this film definitely divided people. But I have to say that my screening had no walkouts and received a standing ovation afterward. I think on the surface, a movie with a ""farting dead Harry Potter"" (and trust me, that's not even a spoiler as crazy as it sounds) is ripe for ridicule but the film is so much more than that and is quite poignant at times. It's not surprising that the directors came from doing music videos as the technical aspects in the directing in this film were quite ingenious and indicative of that type of format. The acting from Radcliffe and Dano was incredible, it's worth seeing the film just for the performances alone. These are the types of films I love and the experience I long for at a film festival. I want to be shown something unexpected and great and outside the box and have no idea what is going to happen next. Trailers these days give away far too much of the plot so it's refreshing to come to a festival and sit and watch a movie I know nothing about and be surprised all along the way.

Needless to say, I got a whole lot more than I bargained for.While the movie was everything I expected it to be, it also had a surprising amount of extremely thought-provoking and interesting dialogue between the film's two leads, Hank and Manny.Speaking of the two leads, both Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano knock it out of the park in their respective roles, Dano as Hank, a lost young man trying to get back to civilization, and Radcliffe as the lovable, amnesic corpse named Manny. Their wonderful chemistry and dialogue is what truly carries the film.First of all, the film is magnificent on a technical level, visually and musically stunning, perfectly capturing the strangely magical tone that Swiss Army Man does so well.The comedy too is also surprisingly hilarious and one of the few times where I've actually found fart jokes to be acceptable. Don't get me wrong, it's not all fart jokes, but don't get turned away by the trailers which makes the film look like it was made by Adam Sandler.Fair warning, this movie is not all sunshine and rainbows. In fact, there were a quite few moments in this movie which had me on the edge of my seat, tearing up, or even questioning the meaning of life.In short, see Swiss Army Man, as it is very much worth your time.

While in the woods Hank tries to teach Manny how to live again, the two undergo a spiritual journey that eventually leads Hank and Manny back to civilization. The movie ends with more questions than what it started with as turn after delightful turn unfold, you are left wondering what the hell is going on.

You try to make sense of the plot the entire time, and can't quite rationalise what's going on. It's realistic enough at times to make you think you might be onto something- to understanding the situation- but then the weirdness comes in afresh and you just get more lost. The best thing is to just let go and let the film carry itself. Because it does. Strongly. Without clichés or relying on what's been done before or sticking to a genre or following guidelines.

I mean, what's with the never-ending farting, for instance? Was that supposed to be funny? Because it was simply ridiculous, as some other attempts to bring laughter were simply gross, and the film had a thing for repeating an already not funny incident over and over, maybe because who made the film thought it was funny, but it just made the incidents unbearably pathetic and annoying. Forty minutes through the film, and I was expecting something that would make this story at least worth watching, and yes, there was a moment right then that gave the story a lifeline, when in his delusion talking to himself, the main protagonist talks about opportunities he missed in life that could have become good things if he had made better choices. The final part of the movie wouldn't be all bad, especially when the thoughts of the movie are lined up, but it had to have an absurd ending that ruined everything. Overall, the idea of the movie was good, but it gets lost between bad jokes, weirdness and absurd events. Acting from Paul Dano was rather good too.",Swiss Army Man

Being so bored and disgusted by it, I hoped there would be some surprise towards the end so i skipped to the end of the film, only to discover it is exactly what I anticipated it to be, and still very boring. I recommend you avoid this film at all cost. Although it might appeal to some teen audiences who like black humor based on farting, vomiting and hugging corpses. I gave it a 1 out of 10.

This film is full of weird things and it would not be as good as if it were not. The film has a beautiful soundtrack that fits every scene. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. The acting, Paul Dano is fantastic and Daniel Radcliffe is surprisingly great for playing a dead guy. Its a love and hate situation for this film because of the content, you might hate it or love it. Through the farts, erections, and crude jokes, you might find a hidden meaning and inspire you in someway as it did with me. While I was watching I tried not to overthink it because that always ruins the film somehow,and the film gradually grew on me.

It's crazy in the real way, it's touching from a far point you can never be close, it's just right there, and it's like when you were young, your dad was reading you the fairy tale, and you were actually believing in it.

It has Daniel Radcliffe who was perfect for Manny, and Paul Dano who was also perfect for Hank. I swear there is no way of telling this is Daniels first film from the perfected direction and writing.

I've seen the trailer quite some time ago and I wanted to give this movie a watch at last.What really drew me to the film was the obvious Daniel Redcliffe, as well as Dank from ""Little Miss Sunshine.""Both of the actors did VERY well in this particular film. I'm so used to seeing Daniel Radcliffe depicted as Harry Potter and this man can really pull of a variety of different characters.Daniel Redcliffe was depicted as a corpse that washed up on the shore of a deserted island. Paul Dano plays as a mentally unstable suicidal man that has lost hope in everything in life, and is very close to hanging himself. However, the corpse gives him a sense of hope, and is the biggest symbolic piece of the entirety of the film.Overall the acting as a whole was impressive. Each characters traits were captivating and helped carry the story on well.The plot of the film doesn't seem promising initially, but as the story progresses the two characters begin to bond and you see lots of growth and a friendship starting to bond. This makes you feel for the characters and makes you want to know more about them.The problem I have with the film is how much it drags on in certain parts. The humor in this film is pretty much non existent... Few funny lines here and there. The plot is unique however, and it would be worthwhile to at least check it out and see what you think.In the end it's a movie you'll either love or hate. Lots of questions will arise as the movie progresses, but it's definitely a captivating film overall and one you won't forget.",Swiss Army Man

241,goicuria,Being alive is a wonderful thing,9,2 August 2016,"Absolutely brilliant film! Entertaining, thought-provoking, well- made, and works in so many ways that it staggers the mind. The are so many levels (deep levels, I might add) that it works on, that to be honest, if anyone does not take something from this film, they must be either extremely shallow or corpses themselves. So you have to suspend belief at times; that should be no problem for the masses who are used to being spoon-fed super-hero, vampires, zombies, and so much more by Hollywood these days. Swiss Army Man forces us as a society to not only come to terms with and accept our suppressed, yet natural human thoughts, body functions, relationships, standards, morals and more, but to relish and rejoice in them and the joy of what it simply means to be alive. It was fun to watch audience reaction in the theater and try to figure out who was laughing simply because something was funny versus ""nervous"" laughter because society has conditioned us not to laugh or find pleasure in things like death, corpses, flatulence, masturbation, alienation, suicide, relationships, and other aspects of life that are par for the course of being alive. While it is being touted as: ""there has never been a movie anything like it"", I beg to differ. I was reminded several times of ""Tideland"" and even ""Weekend At Bernie's"", to mention just two somewhat similar films. I saw it 2 days ago and will see it again, but I am still very much in deep thought regarding this film, and processing it in my mind. In my honest opinion, that right there attests to what a great film should accomplish and stand for, among other things. It's all about individual interpretation and what a given member of the audience can take from such a movie-going experience that could enhance and even enrichen our very lives. It doesn't hurt that Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano are wonderfully gifted as actors. Their chemistry is quite magical as co-leads. An audience should be more than happy to chuckle and follow along with them on this wonderful ride, regardless of the absurdity inherent in the premise of some of the script. I highly recommend it.",Swiss Army Man

It's the kind of movie that's about mostly nothing, doesn't make sense and it has this absurd humor that doesn't catch along with everyone. The music is awe-inspiring simple compositions that have the most nonsensical verses I've yet to hear. The acting is immensely brilliant helped by very good make-up, costumes and camera-work. The image and cinematography is worthy of any high-end Hollywood Oscar-bait, but this one pokes the eyes of the like of the Revenant, for example (btw, I loved that movie's cinematography). This black-comedy is like nothing I've ever seen. It's idiotic (in a fun-sense), it's filled with situational humor not accompanied by the standard low-end movies puns. It makes fun of most friendship-guy-gets-girl stereotypes and in its own sick and twisted way is way better than any such comedies I've seen since... Uhm, ever seen.At times, it's crude and unpolished, and that's why I cannot indulge with a larger than 8/10 grade, but it's a must see for all movie fans. It's as fresh as it gets and more psychedelic than it sounds.

But along with it, very deep messages on how people may see different behaviors and opinions as odd or inappropriate. My thoughts were provoked and my face in an almost constant smile throughout. I walked away from the movie feeling better and knowing my time was not wasted.I highly recommend this film to everyone I talk to about cinema. I'm sure it's difficult to make original films these days because there's nothing new under the sun, but this gets pretty close.

It often messes with natural laws of physics and uses visuals and music to immerse the audience in to the world that the Daniel's created. It uses a great sense of wonder and mystery to make us root for the characters on their journey and knows when to add a layer of grit to scenes to emphasise life's disappointments. It's a character driven film and doesn't rely too heavily on anything in particular, the visuals, music, acting and direction all combine to create a wonderfully creative film. 9/10.If it comes to it and you're trying to decide whether to watch an impactful film that could change your way of thinking or a beautifully creative piece that makes you simply say 'what' then look no further than Swiss Army Man.",Swiss Army Man

I was mainly persuaded to see this film because of its trailer and thought that it will be nice if I can see this movie as a whole.Frankly, I wasn't really expecting the things that the story has brought and laid in front of my eyes. It made me laugh which, I wasn't expecting at first because I am not really a fan of 'superficial' jokes as I would like to call it, but this film got me laughing scene after scene. Plus, the story itself --most especially the parts in the middle. I think those were really nice and, again, I wasn't expecting that such events would happen. I also liked the analogy and the figurative way of the writers in describing some sad truths about the reality and about the world. However, I was kinda disappointed on how the film ended. Personally, it could have been better than that --something that can affect the emotions of the audience more. Production-wise, I was impressed with the production design, the costumes and the props. Some scenes --most especially Manny ones-- left me thinking, ""How did they do that?"" which, is a good thing for me. In addition, I really liked the color and the overall edit of the film. It really did well in better telling the story. Direction, definitely a ""not-bad rating"" for two people who are starting their work in the line of feature films.

I saw everything as a joke in this film and never once took anything seriously, and I don't think that is necessarily a good thing considering this movie wanted you to think. This movie wanted you to think about love, loneliness, death and life, how people hide things from others, and the controversy of sex.

If you think Adam Sandler sense of humour was pathetically childish and repetitive, you are going to have a blast with this one. Or not. Whether you consider this film to be a comedy or an existential comedy drama (which it tries and fails to be quite miserably), the type of humour is so idiotic and uninspiring it will leave you with one regret which is to have given this overrated turd a chance. The subject of life and death deserves a better treatment and clearly the filmmaker behind Swiss Army Man did not know what direction to give his movie so he simply opted to give up and indulged into the crass level. My word is: don't believe the hype around it. This movie has no subtlety at all, it is not moving, the monologues are utterly clueless, the characters depth has not been explored because there is nothing to explore. I still don't see how so many viewers can see it as a light-hearted lesson about life and society when it is everything but. It is a running gag and the joke is on you.

I noticed a by the end of the first act the use of extra-wide shots, not centred on the characters, reinforced the idea of them being lost and alone. Where this film lost me was the overuse of immature humour, it attempted at times to make the viewer feel a deep emotion, but was overshadowed by raw talk about sex and continuous farting.I liked the way the film did talk about being weird and cultural acceptance for that. This indie flick is most certainly not for everybody, but those who can see passed the immature humour and overall strangeness of the film, can come to appreciate it.",Swiss Army Man

The movie starts off kind of slow but slowly the momentum builds on and totally submerges you into it. The visuals are breathtaking, acting is more than brilliant and the director has done a great job at making weird look normal. Over the years movie goers have seen it all and it's so hard to find something new and this movie gives us exactly that. At a time when all genres are becoming saturated, I am glad I stumbled upon this one. For the refreshing experience it gave me, this is a movie that is going to stay with me for a long long time.",Swiss Army Man

It contains beautiful scenes of friendship and love and acceptance of all human beings. Really teaches you about a deeper mening about life. The desperation of being unloved and all alone, and the lengths we go to fight it and find some deeper mening in life. It's not just about action and saving the girl, sometimes you just have to find the one person in life willing to accept you for you. Perfect movie for the society of today, where so many suffer from depression and loneliness that could be cured if someone would just be willing to take the time to accept weirdness. Its a perfect mixture of humor and seriousness. If you don't appreciate it, you should probably watch it again. It truly moved my heart. Weirdest best movie I've seen. Truly beautiful.",Swiss Army Man
280,jostelle,"Do not fool yourselves, there is no deep meaning in this movie",3,5 July 2016,"I went to see Swiss Army Man excited about a potentially unique movie. Unfortunately the movie does not live up to its hype. This story just feels like an attempt to have people find depth and symbolism where there is none. The continuous use of fart noises and the constant corpse boners are a slap in the face for anyone who wants to claim to have found a meaning to the story. It truly feels like the movie goes out of its way to add the most absurd elements into the mix just to show how people can make up all these ""findings"". Like painting cans of soup to prove a point, this movie shows how nowadays you can get away with anything as long as there are people who believe their artistic and intellectual ""abilities"" can justify a complete and utterly disastrous movie. There has to be a reason why the last line of the movie is ""what the f**k?"" and I believe that reason is just to slap your face one last time before exiting the theater.",Swiss Army Man

I can only describe it as strange, weird; yes there is the message of friendship buried deep among all the gas exchange, water spouting and erections. I can imagine Daniel Radcliffe's role must have been challenging and that he must have had difficulty in keeping a straight face with some of the scenes he was asked to play.I saw an interview with him on TV and he said people will either like or hate the movie. I think he's half right - I didn't hate the movie but didn't like it either.

A dead body washes up, farts, and stops him committing suicide. Everything after this is purely in duno's head. Talking, constant farting, the journey they make toether. It doesn't matter if you don't find the farts funny, duno's character does, and this is what drives his fantasy. There is no desert island. Just a lonely and crazy guy trying to find some happiness.

While there were SOME good movies released, such as Deadpool, Rogue One and more, Swiss Army Man is for sure on the list of great 2016 films. This movie just screams originality, with a story that you cannot compare to others. It makes things that seemed disgusting (farts, erections, etc.) beautiful things. The cinematography is magnificent, with dark, blue, and beautiful scenery. Also, the soundtrack of the film is impressive, not using any instruments, and having the actors of the film sing it. This film could easily be classified as a musical. Although, this doesn't mean that there wasn't anything wrong with the film. There were some issues with it, when it kind of ""ran out of funny things"" it continued to turn into something else, like a buddy drama. There's a lot more things to be said about this film, but I stuck with the basics. This movie earns a 7/10 for me.",Swiss Army Man

I thought his roles were most of the time shallow, like he didn't live the character that he had to play.Well coming to this movie maybe all that downside turned into an upside. As a corps he delivers one of his best acting jobs. He plays this part so amazing that i was actually wondering how he did this amazing job. The whole movie is just one funny/amazing/romantic (do i actually dare to say almost as romantic as 'the notebook') journey.

Happiness one can find in silly things, ""inappropriate"" things. ""Insane"" things.

If you find stuff like that funny this movie will make an alright comedy, if you don't this movie has very little redeeming factors.If it was solely a toilet humor comedy I wouldn't really have an issue with this movei but it tries to be philosophical (not subtlety either) having this whole 'enjoy life for what its worth' message to it. Which is a message that has been done millions of times before.Another thing is that this movie is 97 minutes long which it really doesn't need to be but the directors seem so intent on drilling this message into your head they have to derail the objective of the main characters every 5 minutes to show you the 'value of the little things in life'.By far the best thing in this film is the way it's shot during the montages other than that this movie is mediocre at best.Swiss Army Man isn't offensively bad but it isn't worth your time.",Swiss Army Man

Like many others I imagined it to be some kind of cast away with a corse for the volleyball but it was suprisingly different. At this point you should know that farting is an essential plot device in this movie and that it is actually used to underline it's statements. If you cant get over this fact don't even watch it, because it is very heavily featured.I can't help myself fealing kind of weird recommending this movie because it's just plain akward and even uncomfortable to watch at some instances. The cinematography is very good and the metaphoric value every set build has for the story is strongly admirable. After about thirty minutes of runtime I came to appreciate the movie for what it is. A character study and a reflection of human behavior, traditions, norms and values, which is mostly presented through dialogue between the two characters. Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano play they're characters in such an astonishingly believable and sweet way, that you can take them seriously at any time during the movie even though the plot is as ridicoulus as one could imagine. I think this is a piece that many will grow to appreciate after some time and it is definitely going to become a cult classic.",Swiss Army Man
290,hayeonsong,Not a Childish Comedy - My Response to Negative Reviews,8,12 March 2019,"I read a very thorough review on this movie asking what the ""deep"" meanings supposedly presented in this film were. Addressing this question is quite complicated, considering the fact that meanings are a very subjective topic.
Opinions vary greatly depending on who they're coming from, so I will specify that I am someone who has been suffering depression, and this film made me look at life from new eyes.I don't personally like seeing it this way, but for those who hold prejudice upon childish humor or fantasy, try seeing Manny as an imaginary being; a coping mechanism that Hank has subconsciously built to cope with loneliness and depression.The symbolism here is not abstract, quite straightforward;1. The forest is a filter (Only remnants of the ""real world"" are here in the form of trash). It is a simplified summation of life that is a perfect setting in which Manny can help Hank on his journey to finding hope. Hank sees himself as trash, another piece of the lively human population that is worthless. This is when Manny comes in.2. Manny is a new view on everything. Manny helps Hank realize that trash is not useless. While Hank struggles for survival, Manny is the voice that reminds Hank that there is no point of surviving if he is not living. He teaches Hank that even with nothing but trash and a gross farting corpse, he can have the time of his life.I'm not sure what kind of ""deep meaning"" the reviewer was expecting, but I don't know a message that has been more important to me in these hard times than one that helps me find the beauty in everything. How even amidst childish humor, a childish mind holds a world of imagination and positivity that can save a man's life.Another recurring point was that this movie was slow and disgusting. I would see how one may think that with the expectation of a comedy. If you're expecting witty and intelligent jokes, you will find plenty someplace else. Swiss Army Man is NOT a comedy. It is a journey of a broken man, scraping the bottom of popcorn bags, desperate to find a reason to live.I think many ""negative"" reviews towards this film were reasonable in their own sense, and I respect them. I hope they, too, can find a film that they can fall in love with as much as I did with this one.",Swiss Army Man

294,GregoryMohn,Very nearly a perfect movie,9,29 June 2020,"This review is intended to be read by those who have already seen the film. Pointless, I know.When the film was released, I had heard the buzz about it and thankfully, I stayed away from detailed reviews and spoilers of it. And I'm very thankful that I did. This review WILL contain major plot elements and some spoilers.On a whim, without preparation or care, I decided to just watch it. Knowing about the farting and how the film opens, I was prepared for that much. And it was silly. Stupid, really. I actually almost checked out less than 10 minutes into the film. I can see why there was so many walkouts from it's premiere at Sundance.But then I realized it was a much deeper, darker dive into the psyche of a person on the edge of emotional reality. Through most of the film, I was almost sure that the entire thing was happening inside of Hank's mind in the moments just before his death as a result of him hanging himself. The small clues of him speaking about the ""seeing your life flash"" seemed to match up to Manny's quite childlike amazement of everything and knowing nothing from the beginning through to some kind of adolescence and puberty with the SI magazine. And then to finding real love and experiencing that life, as I assumed that he eventually DID all the things they played out, finally meeting the girl and falling in love, etc.THEN, I thought that maybe some of it was real, but he was just reliving the lost opportunities of talking to the girl on the bus, and creating a new reality that he would live out, using a corpse as a surrogate self.THEN, I thought again that almost none of it was real, even the existence of Manny by the time they ended up on Sarah's back lawn. I though that it would be revealed that there was no Manny and that Hank was the one in the body bag, dead just as he reached his only goal to see Sarah one last time as he succumbed to exposure.But then all of those expectations were subverted and it suggests that almost all of what was shown in the film actually happened as other characters discovered the playsets and the abilities of Manny. That part was a little disappointing as it's the least interesting (and most ridiculous) way to explain things in the film.However, I'll admit that I cried harder and longer and in more scenes during this film than any other film I've ever seen. This is a masterclass of acting, directing, editing and scoring to create more emotion in two characters than I've ever seen. Even more of an achievement because one of the characters did not move on his own.The way this story is told through cinematography and character development just worked on every level my brain can appreciate. I give it a 9 instead of a 10 because it is still a bit silly in parts and I really didn't enjoy the father character or how the story resolved itself at the end. It felt like they shoehorned in a ""best case scenario"" for what I was preparing to be a soul-crushingly tragic yet satisfying end for Hank.I'm left wondering what Hank learned or discovered through this story. He was essentially living a fantasy lie, infatuated with the idea of a woman and a life that from the outside would be interpreted as nothing short of stalking. When he finally acted on his unhealthy obsession, he was arrested and will likely be charged with a list of offenses, desecration of a corpse included. Pretty dark.But that doesn't change the fact that it was the most heartwarming and heartbreaking film I've seen in a decade or more. A film about a farting corpse. Highly recommended.",Swiss Army Man

It's about a man named Hank who is stranded on a island. When he is about to give up he sees a body on the shore who's name is Manny. Manny's body is gassy and Hank uses this to his advantage to get to shore. Now he is stuck on land he searches for civilization with Manny who has superhuman abilities. But I think this is a good buddy Drama/comedy there are a few funny moments besides just potty humor. The acting from Daniel Radcliffe is amazing even though he is a dead body he does the character very well. And Paul Dano plays a stranded man who is just trying to survive very well too. But to sum this up. A very good movie and a must watch on my list.,Swiss Army Man

299,budarc,A movie for the rest of us,10,1 July 2016,"After watching this movie, I wiped the tears from my eyes, went into the restroom and washed my face, then walked straight into the next screening of Swiss Army Man. I've only ever done this twice in my life; first with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), then with Little Miss Sunshine (2006, also with Paul Dano). 10 years later, I've finally experienced that same feeling again. This is a movie for the rest of us; the lonely loser weirdos that don't fit in anywhere. I don't care whether you're male, female, straight, gay or whatever, if you have just a little bit of weird inside you, this movie is for you.I guess there are a couple different ways to look at the narrative. You can imagine that Paul Dano is basically out on his own, lost in the wilderness, and he's hoisting around a dead body on his back. Like Hank says at one point, maybe he's just hallucinating all of this, and he's really just using the body as a way to relay his thoughts. Going back to the basics, speaking to the body as if it is an innocent, childlike, unfettered vessel. In a way, he is trying to convince himself why he should go on living. (It's been said that the logline of this movie is that it's about a suicidal man trying to convince a dead body why life is worth living.) There were a couple of moments where I was convinced the movie was going to take the ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" route and reveal that Hank had succeeded in his suicide, but I'm glad it didn't take that predictable twist (although it is a valid interpretation). Then there is the magical element, which is fully supported by the ending (the objective view of the cameraman's camera, as well as everyone else who witnesses Manny jetting out into the sea) and everything actually happened as we saw it. How reliable is Hank as a narrator? Is it even fair to hold this up to the same conventions as other movies? It's still entirely satisfying if you watch the movie at face value without any other explanation for what's going on. The other thing that popped in my head while watching it is whether or not this is a ""gay"" allegory. I was more convinced of this during my second screening than I was at my first one. But again, I don't think it's fair to hold this up to the same conventions of other movies. Although there is cross-dressing and the characters share a kiss (though it could be argued Hank was just trying to get oxygen, or perhaps blow into Manny's mouth in order to stimulate more gases/dislodge the cork which then propel them out of the water), it is never explicitly stated that they may be homosexual (or necrosexual, if that's the right word). At the end, Manny proclaims that they are ""best friends,"" which I think is the correct way to view their relationship. Nevertheless, the theme of the movie seems to be about finding someone you can be yourself with, regardless of gender or sexual norms. If you choose to view all the events that happen in the film as being Hank's hallucinations (despite the fact that Manny hefts him on his back during the last leg of their journey, after Hank breaks his leg), I think the meaning becomes more about loving yourself for who you are. The cathartic moment comes at the very end when Hank admits he built all those strange creations and is finally able to fart in public. Basically, let your freak flag fly. This is just the kind of movie I needed at this juncture in my life.",Swiss Army Man

This movie dives into the heaviest of issues and the seemingly juvenile humor plays perfectly into all of it. It challenges social mores and asks existential questions about life, love, sex, death, and yes...flatulence. It is hilarious and absurd, yet somehow still manages to be seamlessly thoughtful. Also, the soundtrack is fantastic and a huge part of the movie. It was written by members of the rock and roll band, Manchester Orchestra, but it's actually entirely accapella and performed by the actors in the film, because the music is supposed to be happening inside of the main characters head. It is very ambient and atmospheric with tons of really beautiful layered harmonies and it still somehow works surprisingly well for this very odd film and adds so much to it. I also enjoyed the bands frontman making a cameo and a clip of one of their songs playing on a radio in one scene.Overall, this movie is lots of fun and might even give you some things to think and talk about with your friends afterword.",Swiss Army Man

The constant infantile fart jokes, I could handle, but the inept interpretation of the main role by Paul Dano ruined the movie for me. As for looking for any depth in this pile of ordure, the phrase ""Emperors New Clothes"" springs to mind. The Emperor is not wearing any 'clothes' in this movie. There is no discernible depth to any character or a hint of any depth of plot here, or indeed any apparent plot at all. I can't think that Radcliffe is arrogant enough to test the notion that all he has to do is appear in a film and then rake in the cash. Look what has happened to other ex - 'child stars'.

If you are a Daniel Radcliffe fan (and can't get enough of his farts), love indie music and don't care about a proper movie with good humor and a decent story...

312,c-pi57,"Unquestionably unique, introspective yet juvenile",6,2 July 2016,"Swiss Army Man is definitely polarizing. I saw it in a theater of about 18 people, and by the time the movie was over, only five were left, including myself. And while the 12 or so who walked out were clearly disgusted, the ones who remained had obviously enjoyed the experience tremendously. As for myself, I'm still quite unsure of how I feel about the film. It was extremely original, with a premise that starts out as slow and a bit boring, and then out of nowhere turns to into one big sex joke. By the time we learned of Daniel Radcliffe's magical boner, most of the audience was already gone and I had also begun to feel very unsure. However, once the movie expanded upon its themes and we start realizing what exactly is going on with Paul Dano's character (or so we think), the story becomes very touching and makes you reevaluate life and all the reasons whether or not to live. Of course, the ending does a complete 180 on what you think you know and ends up confusing the viewer once again. I'm sure this was intentional, but it feels a little forced and ambiguous in an unsatisfying way.Nevertheless, the performances were fantastic. I've seen Daniel in quite a bit besides Harry Potter, and he truly shines as the ""corpse"" and makes the character quite sweet. Paul Dano has proved himself as one of the greatest young character actors of this generation and does not disappoint. The cinematography is also breathtaking in its simplicity. The film also did provide for quite a few laughs if you can get past the juvenile, Sandler-esque humor of it all. It is definitely one to see if you're looking for a film to make you think about life, solitude, and what love truly is, even if it does slightly miss the mark in packing a big emotional punch.",Swiss Army Man
313,jonascoutinho,"It is weird, but it is a master piece of weirdness!",10,2 October 2016,"In this era when there are more reboots than ever, find a film that is almost entirely original is as hard as find a movie session where no one uses a mobile until the end of the film.It is such a hard assignment to describe such a peculiar film as this Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's feature film. I will at least try my best.The screenplay is outstanding for being brave enough to talk about issues as death, loneliness, social habits with a genius sense of humor that is actually very effective. It made me think about all of this at the same time I was appreciating Daniel Redcliffe's best performance of his entire career. It is magnificent. He really convinced me he was a dead guy. Paul Dano is fantastic here. He transmits all the feelings of his character so easily, I almost cried for him, but the humor was for the most part of the film so intense that I could not be consumed by tears.There is one aspect of this movie which deserves an Academy Award for sure (At least a nomination). I am talking about the Original Soundtrack. Is brilliant, I can not think of anything else apart from it. How many films can you remember that had such a unique soundtrack? A lot of them, I am sure of it. So you can add this one on your list.",Swiss Army Man

I took a sick day today and wanted to watch a simple movie just to pass the time and kill the boredom of staying in bed... After 5 minutes I knew that this is not that type of movie at all... but the movie does not let you let it go. It's a movie that cannot be left unfinished...It has something to say...It speaks to everyone all through...from the start to the end. It makes you wonder just like the main character in a field with all the familiar terrains but alien and unknown at the same time...all throughout the movie I could not believe that the movie is this good and I expected a cliché to pop up eventually and the movie falls off from its ascent but that never happened and the movie takes you to exactly where it wanted to...to a place that you could never have imagined!

Nothing gross, I just mean it really makes you think about the nature of love and who might embody (pun intended) that love. A few surprises, more farts than really necessary (but that was to be expected), and I gotta give Danny R true kudos for best acting from a cadaver!

340,aggelosmor,Finally an original movie,9,30 September 2016,"I don't usually like fart jokes and I think is the most cheap way for a comedy to be funny but this movie is very different. All these ""cheap"" jokes are there for a reason. SPOILERSPaul Dano's character is about to end his life and then he finds the ""dead"" body of the excellent Daniel Radcliffe. Our protagonist is depressed and thinks that he has no reason to live for, but the ""swiss army"" man wants to learn about life, love, sex etc. He is the ""lost"" spirit of our protagonist. Hank is alive but kinda dead inside and on the other hand Manny is a dead body full of passion to live and yes he is the other half of our protagonist.The way that the directors (Daniels) say to us the audience that we don't have to hide our feelings from our closest people is very unique. Is the fart. And as I said before I don't like fart jokes but this one was hilarious and emotional at the same time for me. I remember that this movie was booed at festivals.That sucks. The last years are very boring for cinema. Full of reboots that nobody asked for, sequels, prequels ,spin offs, alternative time lines etc. And now we finally have a unique and original movie! I think it's a must see movie, and one of the best (and of course the weirdest) of 2016.

But isn't this, what the whole movie is about? Letting it all out...? I just felt obligated to write something about it, because this movie managed something not a lot of movies or books or TV-series managed to do to me in recent times: Really think about it.It is not just another movie you watch, enjoy a few entertaining scenes, talk one or two minutes about it afterwards and then just forget about ... letting it sink back into oblivion. The ending made me wanting to learn more about it, made me wanting to read other opinions about it... And that's also what I especially liked: There isn't just one clear resolution. The movie can be interpreted in many different ways...But I guess one isn't usually watching a movie just to interpret it in different ways afterwards. One is watching a movie to experience something new, to become caught up in a different world, to be entertained and at best to be touched emotionally.I think the movie complies with all these points but I ""only"" could give it 7 points because I felt that the movie was a bit repetitive at some points and prolonged unnecessarily at others.But still, the actors where great: I never thought much of Daniel Radcliff but despite his difficult character, a corpse, he made me feel sympathy for him...Altogether: A very special movie (and even though it really IS so special, I never got the impression it was forced), a big plus point for creativity, music and actors (just two actors for the most part of the film, but never got bored of their faces or anything)and definitely worth a watch.",Swiss Army Man

346,orion-canning,For everyone who thinks this movie is just fart jokes...,10,30 August 2018,"I was compelled to respond to all the 1 star reviews. As someone who actually really dislikes fart jokes, finding them to be lazy writing that only attempts to appeal to the lowest common denominator, I can sympathize with anyone who would be skeptical of this movie at first.But I love this movie. These are not merely fart jokes, but a much deeper and richer metaphor. There's another review on here that goes into some length to describe how Dano's character Hank is an unreliable narrator, a troubled and delusional, suicidal man in the midst of a mental breakdown. While I find that review to be an accurate reading it doesn't fully explore the film's use of metaphor which function on many levels. The first level is the film's plot itself which can be read as everything we are being shown is really happening, or that we are seeing things from Hank's perspective and he is hallucinating and delusional.But to go deeper than that, this is a movie about shame and repression so strong that it makes you unable to express your own inner feelings. It directly comments on this in numerous ways, through the long discussion of Hanks's shameful feelings about masturbation, how he constantly tells Manny not to do things because people will think he is being weird. Manny is doing what comes naturally and just being honest and talking without filters. Everything is new to him and he approaches the world like a child, wondering and asking questions about everything.Manny is innocent and has not learned shame yet. Society shames all of us, and teaches us that there are right and wrong ways of behaving. There are proper ways of behaving in public, and as children, when we act naturally, we are usually shamed, maybe even punished for breaking the rules of polite society. These rules rely on numerous pre-concieved notions but are in actuality completely arbitrary. The idea that a fart or a boner are gross are value judgement that rely on the idea that there can be something wrong with our natural body functions. Thus are we taught to be ashamed of our own bodies, taught to conceal nudity and hold in our farts.I could go further into how religion and polite society frame innocent body functions as perversions, but Hank's insecurity extends into shaming of other behavior, his repression is so extensive that he is uncomfortable in expressing basic emotions. This is explored through the recreation of meeting the girl on the bus, and how someone without preconceived notions of right and wrong behavior and societal repression would approach the situation entirely differently. Dano is so afraid of how other's might perceive him that he never approaches this girl he feels a connection to, Hank is his un-repressed inner asking him why anyone would ever stop themselves from doing what would make them happy.So this movie is questioning society's arbitrary rules, public shaming that causes social anxiety and shyness and forces people to conform to socially acceptable behavior. It uses body functions as a metaphor for that. Farting in the film is a metaphor for holding feelings inside or hiding your true self. In the final scene of the film Hank lets out a fart in front of other people in a last desperate attempt to revive Manny, Manny who represents his inner child. Throughout the film he brings Danny to life by letting go of and coming to terms with his inner repression, learning to re-approach life with playfulness, curiosity, and creativity, as a child would. So in that final scene he is ""letting go"" of his repression.There is one more level that all of this operates on, and it's here that I have to say that I have pity for people who could not see any deeper meaning in this film. Because it confronts the ways in which we take ourselves too seriously, when in reality part of the human condition is living in these strange and amazing and earthy vessels we call bodies. And bodies are amazing things that operate on a level of complexity that science still struggles to understand, outright magical in fact. But we ignore that magic and instead frame our viewing of our bodies with shame and repression. The film playfully confronts us with bodily functions in order to make us confront our own relationships with our bodies. As someone who normally despises bathroom humor I was amazed to find myself laughing out loud and feeling outright joy at moments of reveling in bodily humor that were outright triumphant.This is in part a movie that tries to teach us to enjoy life by taking it less seriously, by showing us a man who is learning to do the same. And so if you despise this movie, I think if you spent your time doing nothing but trying to learn to find enjoyment in this film, and trying to understand why other people do, you would find yourself letting go of repression and finding empathy beyond what you knew you were capable of. I think it would be entirely worth it.",Swiss Army Man

I absolutely did NOT see anything of substance as far as comedy or even adventure.I honestly don't know what else to say other than if you want to waste an hour and a half of your life on this movie at least do it while you're high and maybe you will find the things that were supposed to make you laugh that I obviously couldn't.",Swiss Army Man

354,Kushxansman_21,Extraordinarily Beautiful,9,28 November 2016,"I honestly don't think I have ever seen a movie as original and surreal as this, in the world of remakes, reboots and an overload of superhero films, Swiss Army Man truly is a breath of fresh air for the movie industry. The film starts out with Paul Dano's character Hank, a depressed, isolated man attempting suicide on a deserted island seemingly far from civilization, when just as he's about to go through with it, a washed up body appears on shore that is supposedly dead. After discovering the body has supernatural powers that can help him survive, Hank sets off on an insane journey with his new friend and corpse named Manny, played brilliantly by Daniel Radcliffe, where they discuss life, love and what it means to be human all whilst trying to get out of the woods.This movie is the definition of original, there is nothing like it and this is one of the main reasons as to why it stands out for me and why I love it. Everything about it works so incredibly well, the direction is unique and works splendidly for the film, the editing is great as well as the cinematography, the acting is exceptional from both leads, not to mention the music is down right perfect in this movie. The whole thing is what it looks like when the filmmakers really let go and express themselves in the most bizarre way imaginable and for that, I love them for it.Something that really surprised me while watching it was just how incredibly funny it was, there was so much great humor mainly due to Daniel Radcliffe who was very hilarious throughout the entire movie, one thing I admire about it is it's not crude for the sake of being crude, it has a much deeper meaning to it about freedom, what it means to truly be free, and what is normal and what is considered wrong/different.The film literally blew me away, I laughed and I cried many many times while watching, it is very rare a movie like Swiss Army Man comes along and sweeps you off your feet with it's unique beauty and mind blowing creativity. It's the kind of movie you will think about for days on end, not because it's thought provoking but because it's special, because it has heart. If you have ever experienced loneliness in your life, even for a short while then you will appreciate this film just that little bit more. Either way though, I think each individual will relate to it in some way, shape or form, because at the end of the day we're all a little weird.",Swiss Army Man

361,WrestlingNun,8/10,8,24 October 2016,"First of all, from just the first 5 minutes you'll notice that this is not your normal comedy movie, this is a lot more weird than most (if not all) comedy movies nowadays. It's the story of a man who gets stranded on an island and before killing himself he sees a man in the shore, he then proceeds to ""rescue"" him and a lot of stuff goes down.It's a good movie if you think about it. Yes, it's weird (since it's a comedy) but most of it has deep meaning in it like how the farts represent freedom. I mean farting is like one example of simple things that we are ashamed of. Just like love, Hank shows us that just like most of us he is ashamed of the fact the he wants love, that he is alone and feels loneliness. It's like you are not allowed to tell people that because you feel it will push them away (just like farting). The film explores these walls we build up that keeps us away from a connection.I also think that this film showed the most powerful and wonderful part of a relationship where someone can break down that wall you've build up and help you become more of yourself. As what Manny said ""maybe we are all just ugly, dying sacks of sh*t and maybe all it'll take is just one person to just be okay with that and then the whole world will be dancing, and singing, and farting, and everybody will feel a little bit less alone"".Love then is possible when we are able to become our true selves and overcome that shame, that fear we hold on to.",Swiss Army Man

Still not sure what to make of it all. The writing is very 'this decade' with metaphysical stipulations about the self, identity, existence, sexuality, meaning. The filming itself is incredible. They've managed to achieve a near flawless execution, achieving things that I've never seen before. The acting is unpretentious and will hopefully set these actors up with more respect. Considering most the film is just set in one or two locations, with the camera mostly focussed on just one or two people, one of whom is lifeless, it manages to keep the audience engaged and interested with humorous - though bordering on creepy and psychopathic at times - interactions with themselves and the environment. We are constantly reframing the plot in our minds and imagining what might actually be happening. You won't find out what was actually happening until the very end. And that's the genius of it, though I will not explain this for you here. If you do watch it and get to the end, then will you have understood the plot. Other themes: obsession, mind and thoughts (power of thoughts on others), insanity.

369,godmendall,This tale for only the lowest- and highest-brow intellects introduces us to ourselves in all of our fetid charm.,10,20 July 2016,"This is a movie with a prodigious amount of farting. Manny: ""If my best friend hides his farts from me then what else is he hiding from me, and why does that make me feel so alone?"" But it's a movie about bro relationships. If it takes a lifetime or more to ""know thy screwed- up self"", it will take many more lifetimes to ""know thyself in the context of other screwed-up selves."" But we don't have much time, and life gets thick, quick. We all want to have at least one pure friendship with loyalty and love that's not about—what Manny referred to as—""boobs, vaginas, butts."" Or penises for that matter (""Manny, I think your penis is guiding us home!""). Bromance is about keeping things completely Platonic so that both parties are bringing something to the table, and leaving each other alone at the end of the day. It's not sexual, or parental, or dependent, or enabling, or parasitic, or domineering. But it's not just a bro story. The corpse can be easily understood to be Hank's alter ego and the need to externalize our internal landscape. Joseph Campbell believed that even our most horrific stories seldom wish to plunge into the inhumanity of our existence. ""Generally we refuse to admit within ourselves, or within our friends, the fullness of that pushing, self-protective, malodorous, carnivorous, lecherous fever which is the very nature of the organic cell."" Our nastiness must be dealt with , but according to Campbell our shadows must be censored from our delicate egos, appearing as the 'ogres' in our stories which are actually ""reflections of the unsolved enigmas of our own humanity."" It is critical and necessary that we come to terms, to some extent, with our humanity and inhumanity. We must, at some point, explore our dark places if we are ever to find our way. The poet W. S. Merwin wrote that all light gathering leaves are the direct result of roots saturated with darkness, and that humans must grow by ""touching the darkness of their whole story from which their leaves open."" The coexistence of beauty and ugliness, good and evil, love and hate, life and death has fascinated people throughout history. Why? Because we can't seem to escape the fact that our fears and filth dwell side-by-side with our most wholesome traits and cherished hopes. That's why farts. Cuz us. We are a lot of things to each other including resource, support and reflection. We are each other's Swiss Army Men and women. We bring each other to life.

372,zathura-77281,A refreshing new perspective,8,5 October 2016,"With countless superhero movies, sequels to prequels, and cliché romance movies, the film industry rarely surprises me anymore. Much too often, season viewers can predict movies by relating it to a similar one. The sad truth is that this is not a coincidence. If a movie is successful others will copy it. This mindset to make ""safe"" and profitable movies, monopolizes the film industry into an unoriginal art form. Don't get me wrong here. There is a reason why these movies are profitable in the first place. I for one can enjoy these classic super hero story movies. It is just refreshing to get a modern movie that doesn't follow the rules and leaves room for inquiry. If you've ever read then you know books leave a lot of the work to your imagination. On the other hand, videos in general leave minimal room for interpretation. Swiss Army Man is the exact opposite. Through authenticity of the protagonist's sanity, the story is set in a somewhat realistic fictional world. What seems to be real compared what could be fake shows a lot more about a character than just reciting his or her background.Swiss Army Man by the directors known collectively as the Daniels is an original indie. It starts with Paul Dano on the beach ready to hang himself after being stranded on what he thinks is a deserted island. Before he hangs himself he sees a body wash onto shore. Ironically the urge to save this man also serves to save himself. Radcliffe, the dead body, has unique abilities that Dano uses to get back to society. It isn't until a quarter way through the movie that Radcliffe gains a conscience. Without any memory of his former life, Radcliffe learns everything he knows from Dano. It is through these conversations that Radcliffe develops a desire to see society, while Dano gains a new perspective about living life. With an over exaggerated fart, Radcliffe uses it to literally and psychologically save Dano. The fart is seen as something that we keep in because society tells us to. Like a fart we keep in so many other things because we fear disapproval. Once realizing the oppression of society, both Dano and Radcliffe are stuck with the question, why are they even trying to return back.",Swiss Army Man

379,mike-82085,Don't be fooled by many of the reviews; Swiss Army Man is a rigorous and unflinching portrayal,10,15 November 2016,"In my view, Swiss Army Man is an unflinching and clinical documentary of the emotional life of a mentally ill, severely repressed adolescent boy named Hank, whose diminished mental capacity has been exacerbated by a repressive and dominant father. The father's violations have induced excessive shame with regard to normal bodily functions (farting, pooping, fantasizing about girls, masturbating); the boy is disturbed by the powerful sexual urges experienced by any teenager, and is painfully shy, lonely and socially isolated. Hank has been laughed at by others; his father has called him retarded and presumably diminished his sense of self in plenty of other ways. His mother appears to be kinder towards him but his father is dominant.Seeking love and kindness, Hank has fixated on a girl on the bus. He knows where she lives, runs away from home, and camps out in the woods by her home. All he has to eat is some junk food and soda. He quickly runs out of food and drinks bad water from a stream. With such a poor diet his body is exhibiting gastrointestinal problems and he's farting and pooping, shaming him further. He's having the normal erections and lustful thoughts of a teenager and is haunted by guilt and repression. His loneliness and sense of isolation manifests in a delusion that he is living on a desert island. He decides to kill himself but the rope he assembles from litter in the woods comes apart. Something triggers a deeper psychosis: perhaps the failed suicide attempt; perhaps he truly discovers a corpse in the woods; or perhaps he ""simply"" drops into a more manic episode. In any event he resolves his shameful feelings by splitting into two personalities, constructing an alter ego, Manny. It is Manny, not Hank, who is doing all the farting, having all the erections, having the mother fantasies. He is in two minds about whether to give Manny his fantasy about the girl since he wants to keep her for himself, since she is Hank's hope for rescue from his torment, his deliverer of love and affection and sexual gratification. In Manny all the shameful body functions become legitimized: the farts become a form of locomotion, the erections become the compass to the girl (she is after all the focus of these). Hank's euphoria (racing through the water on top of Manny) suggests a manic high.Manny speaks with Hank's own inner repressed voice, or perhaps his mother's voice, telling him there's nothing wrong with his sexual desire, or his farting. Manny articulates his confusion about being laughed at and being called retarded. While Manny takes the role of Hank, Hank dresses as a woman, as the girl he wants to love him, seeking some kind of comfort and intimacy, trying desperately to fulfill his own needs by himself, trying to reinvent his life and find some emotional rescue. He tells Manny how to be attractive to women, how to walk and talk and wear shades, while admitting his own shyness and lack of courage. Manny meanwhile also ""saves"" him from his physical distress, becoming his magical source for the food and water he doesn't really have. In the woods Hank also encounters the normal life of the American northwest, a raccoon, animal sounds in the bushes, juniper berries that make him sick. A sewage pipe across a stream (source of the dirty water he's drinking) becomes in his imagination a dangerous crossing over a great river. He falls in and is ""rescued"" by Manny.An encounter, real or imagined, with a bear finally drives Hank out of the woods, perhaps wounded. The sad story ends when he emerges into the back yard of the woman he has fixated on. She discovers him talking to her young daughter, gets her child away, and calls for help. Hank only sees that she is caring for him. Things now start happening very quickly: the police and social services and Hank's father arrive. His father walks away from him, rejecting him once again. Hank runs off and is chased and brought back. He rationalizes this experience of ""rescue"" into a new script where everyone now understands and cares for him. He has been welcomed home, his father gives him the slightest nod of approval, an indication by the filmmakers of how Hank is converting the most insignificant signals into experiences of approval and understanding. Everything will be OK. Manny no longer has a role; he takes off, seen by everyone to be taking Hank's shame with him. Hank is now in the hands of others, believing in his salvation while doubtless en route to medication and mental health services.The film is quite unflinching in its portrayal and gives away nothing. It is a sign of its success that the emotional experience of the viewer is not sadness for this terribly sad story, but of bewilderment and an uneasy humor. Viewers have reported a wide range of responses: leaving early, disgusted by the ""cheap laughs""; feeling that it delivered an immature, childish philosophy; experiencing it as a profound meditation on modern life and death. But in fact the movie does nothing more or less than attempt to describe an episode in the life of a disturbed, possibly bi-polar or schizophrenic, certainly repressed and emotionally violated young man. Whether the depiction is psychologically accurate I am not qualified to say, but the preoccupation with farts and sex and childish philosophies are not those of the film makers but of the young man being portrayed. It is to the credit of the film makers that they never deviated from this portrayal and never made any attempt to distinguish themselves from the subject, to the extent that many people may be entirely mistaken in their interpretation of the film and of the directors' abilities and intentions. That is both courageous and skillful. Well done Daniels!!",Swiss Army Man

The script deals basic with friendship and true love, wherever it comes from. It includes comedy, drama, musical, action, and sci-fi, all of them used harmoniously and came to impressive results. The directing was spectacular. The image was eye-catching, with wild and beautiful scenery.The actors played a very serious part to this result. They gave life to the script in a higher than any expectation way. Personally I think Daniel Radcliffe is one of the best actors of his generation. He did a really tough work in this movie.

If you are not one of those above, and eventually will watch a movie with a rating 7 and above. u will enjoy this movie but make yourself away from any judgment (comparing) nor over-thinking. Personally i'm giving it 7 because the 'message' of this movie was successfully delivered to me.",Swiss Army Man
387,Toppris,A unique movie,7,27 May 2019,"It moved me, and i don't know why.
Left me crying during credits",Swiss Army Man
388,chloelouise-59054,JUST NO,1,18 December 2017,"Possibly the worst movie I've ever had to endure. There is nothing artistic about a farting corpse using it's gas to speed off in the ocean while everyone stares at it longingly like it's beautiful. this whole film was just, no. and the acting was subpar.",Swiss Army Man
389,mwendell3660,Awful....,1,11 March 2018,"Skip this movie...There is nothing going on here. I found this movie to be just utter garbage. There is plenty of good movies in the world today, but this is not one of them, do not waste your time.",Swiss Army Man

392,sartre-16665,no depth? you guys are blind? Is this film an IQ Test?,10,2 January 2019,"This Movie is one of the best of its genre ive ever seen, and actually everybody here whos talking about no depth and bad jokes just didnt get the movie....there is so much depth in the story, in its dia-(mono-)logs, the jokes, the whole atmosphete.....i think this movie might be kind of an iq test for emotional intelligence, and the ability to think reflective.....those who say this movie is stupid, the movie made a good portray of you guys too, didnt see it? no? then maybe just watch the movie again, bit more open minded. Id say if id have a look at this movie together with Nietzsche, wed laugh and cry our asses off together so much, as you would never imagined it from syphillis nietzsche ;)watch the movie and make your own decision :P comments are so polarised here and i did my best to keep my comment in line ;)",Swiss Army Man
393,tamarablagrave,Shockingly Perfect!,10,3 February 2019,"I've seen a lot of reviews putting this film down for its toilet humor, but I think those reviews have, sadly, only skimmed the surface. This movie had me, admittedly, skeptical. After a few minutes of selling into it, I saw a story that we can all relate to on some level. It's a story of our fearls of being seen for what we really are, no edits. It's asking why we judge each other and ourselves down to the most basic and fundamental parts of just being living creatures.By the end of this movie, my partner, my son and I were laughing as tears steamed down or cheeks. Not many movies have done that to me. I also have to throw in that when my teenage son is swept up by a movie to the point of crying and laughing simultaneously, it would be far from pretentious to say he loved it.If you don't mind some brutal honesty about the things that make us all human and you're willing to open your mind to something truly different, this film will have you laughing, choking up, and everything in between in a way you'd never experienced before. Can't recommend it enough! It was a truly, unexpectedly perfect change of pace!",Swiss Army Man
394,jaredjbarton,Uncomfortably Human,10,11 February 2019,This is hands down the weirdest movie I have ever watched but also one of the realest and most human. The topics it covers and conversations that are had in the movie were sometimes hard to confront even as a viewer if that makes sense. If you can get pass the weirdness and bathroom humor i promise it's worth the ride.,Swiss Army Man
