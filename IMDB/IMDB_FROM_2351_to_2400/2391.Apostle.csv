0,Leofwine_draca,Not as good as it should be,6,13 October 2018,"As a massive fan of director Gareth Evans and his two RAID masterpieces, I was eagerly awaited his much-delayed next feature. But it turns out that APOSTLE is a very different beast altogether, and nowhere near as satisfying as those pulse-pounding masterpieces. It's a perfectly acceptable watch as a film, but there's no denying that this is a derivative and minor work, in which the storyline feels stretched out to fit the two hour running time. The obvious inspiration here is THE WICKER MAN but I was surprised to see this turning GAME OF THRONES lite in the second half. The first hour is a definite slow burner and very well directed, although Dan Stevens is a bit over the top as the protagonist. The second half is quite bitty, featuring some decent set-pieces, action and gore effects, but feeling disappointingly thin overall. The supporting cast put in assured performances but once every slightest bit of mystery is explained the film loses its mystique and the supernatural elements never really gel with the story of human jealousy and rivalry. I'd say that APOSTLE's worth a watch, but it's not one I'd be in a hurry to revisit.",Apostle
1,SnoopyStyle,good Netflix flick,7,7 November 2018,"Thomas Richardson (Dan Stevens) is on a mission to save his sister who has been kidnapped by a cult living on an isolated island. The leader Malcolm Howe (Michael Sheen) and two others started the community. Thomas sneaks onto the island. There is paranoid fear of the King's men and one assassin makes the attempt on Malcolm only to be saved by Thomas. Thomas discovers that the group is a supernatural blood cult.This is The Wicker Man if that movie is any good. There is good tension and constant dread. It does need more in the introduction. At least, it should be clearer. It should start with him getting branded in China. That's a great scene and it could inject a little supernatural into the world. It also needs to declare the time and place more forcefully. Even with the two hour version, the intro needs more. Stevens and Sheen are both very solid. The visual imagination is beautiful. With the thick plot, it is a little choppy with many characters. A bit of trimming could help. Overall, this is a very good Netflix movie.",Apostle
2,claudio_carvalho,Weird Violent Mess,4,15 October 2018,"""Apostle"" is an overrated violent film where the viewer expects more explanation along the weird story, but out of the blue the movie ends. The plot begins without any character development and the time and place are not defined (maybe in the beginning of the Twentieth Century). In the first scene, the viewer learns that a wealthy woman has been kidnapped and taken to an island by a dangerous sect that wants ransom to release her. Her brother decides to travel to the island and infiltrate in the sect to find whether she is alive or not. Dan Stevens performs the brother that is a sort of anti-hero, being beaten and wounded in every confrontation. He is seriously wounded protecting the leader of the sect without any explanation. The funny thing is that immediately after he swims in sewage looking for his sister and without any infection in the wound. The twist is a being arrested in a cabin that the messy screenplay throws on the screen without any explanation. There are free violence along the story and the conclusion is also awful. Is NETFLIX using robots to promote this flick? My vote is four.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Apostle
3,nogodnomasters,Don't pay the ransom,8,29 November 2018,"In 1905 Thomas Richardson (Dan Stevens) goes to the island of Erstan in hopes of finding his ransomed sister Jennifer (Elen Rhys). He has to blend in with the cult which runs the island in order to find her. They worship the island goddess (Sharon Morgan), which apparently requires a blood sacrifice. Malcolm (Michael Sheen) is the chosen leader. His daughter (Lucy Boynton) is sweet on Thomas. Thomas creates allies with a young couple he caught out after curfew.It was an interesting film. I had flashbacks to ""The Wicker Man"" as a cult island with an outsider. Although that is where the similarity ends.Guide: 1 F-word. Brief clothed sex scene. No nudity.",Apostle
4,kosmasp,Apostle Man,8,22 April 2019,"Folk stories can be crazy or at least sound crazy. Then again sometimes there is something underneath it all - no pun intended. Having a movie that builds a mythological background and gives you a fantasy world to live in might be something you like or not. That is something for you to decide. It's nice to see Gareth going this way directing wise.Getting something differnt to do than Raid. Though he already dipped his toes into horror before of course. Directing wise this is really good and the story, the costumes, the whole set up work. You really believe in the world that has been created, which is imperial for the movie to work ... and that ending? Well it could not have been chosen better (imho)",Apostle
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Wow that was intense.,8,6 November 2018,"It really does surprise me that this film didn't get a big theatrical release, logically I don't really understand why. Its original, has a great cast and boasts a terrific story line. The cinematography is terrific, it had superb production values, it really looks slick and very well made. I can't decide who stands out in particular, but the acting in general is exceptional, with Michael Sheen perhaps ending the charisma stakes.It's a very macabre storyline, possibly the reason for its lack of release, if you've seen The Witch, that's a good idea of the tone you'll get here, very dark to the point of being bleak.This isn't for everyone, but I loved it. 8/10",Apostle
6,BA_Harrison,Where's Iko Uwais when you need him?,5,15 October 2018,"I tend to steer clear of Netflix originals (Annihilation will do that to a person), while any comparisons to snooze-fest The VVitch I find off-putting, but Apostle sees Welsh action genius Gareth Evans (an awesome martial arts director) returning to his homeland to turn his hand to horror (my favourite genre), something he had dabbled with in V/H/S/2. It's more than enough to pique my interest...Unfortunately, Apostle turns out to be something of a disappointment: the first half of the film plods along at a snail's pace, as Thomas Richardson (Dan Stevens) infiltrates a religious cult living on an isolated island, hoping to find and free his sister, who is being held for ransom. As Thomas scouts the cult's village, he slowly realises the enormity of the danger that he is in - with the emphasis on 'slowly'. It's tough going.The pace of the second half picks up a touch, with more action (expertly handled-no surprises there) and some brutal gore. The plot, however, is all over the place, with the introduction of an elderly Earth goddess who requires blood in order to make things grow, and who is aided by a Silent Hill-style creature whose head is wrapped in wicker. We also get inter-cult rivalry, with Prophet Malcolm (Michael Sheen) usurped by his loony right hand man Quinn (Mark Lewis Jones), while a doomed romance between teenagers Jeremy (Bill Milner) and Ffion (Kristine Froseth) seems kind of pointless (other than to lead to a gratuitous spot of torture involving a large cranial drill).On a more positive note, the film looks great throughout, but watching Apostle one wishes that Evans had simply put his creative energy into another Raid film.",Apostle
7,paul_haakonsen,This was actually rather interesting...,6,9 August 2020,"I happened to find the 2018 movie ""Apostle"" on Netflix. And since I hadn't seen it before, nor even heard about it, I must say that the title made me stop and read the synopsis. And it did sound like the movie could be interesting. So I ended up sitting down to watch it.And I will say that writer and director Gareth Evans definitely had something interesting here with ""Apostle"". It was a light horror movie, I would say, laced with a pinch of supernatural elements and also heavy on the thriller ingredients. Which actually made for a rather wholesome entertaining movie. I definitely enjoyed the movie from start to end.The storyline was good, and it wasn't an overly generic or predictable one, so that was definitely a plus in favor of the movie. And the storyline had some nicely fleshed out characters with good stories.And of course, having a good ensemble of casted actors and actresses definitely helped spruce up the movie as well. Michael Sheen was simply amazing in the movie, and he was so well-cast for that particular role.I found ""Apostle"" to be interesting, and I definitely liked that director Gareth Evans didn't over-use the supernatural elements with the goddess too much. It was done with enough elegance that it served to spice the movie up instead of taking focus away from the rest of the movie.My rating of the 2018 movie ""Apostle"" is a six out of ten stars. If you haven't already seen it, and find yourself with the chance to do so, you should...",Apostle
8,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly enjoyable if flawed effort,7,23 January 2019,"Called out to a remote island, a man is sent to retrieve his sister from a pagan cult based on an island lead by a charismatic leader and tries to ingrain himself into their society in order to save her only to find that the cult may be more dangerous than expected putting his quest in jeopardy.This had a lot to enjoy about it alongside some problems. One of the major forces to enjoy with this one is the fact that there's a great deal of creepiness for the community itself. The idea of them being isolated from the rest of the country where they practice their extreme religious fanaticism creates a spectacular setup to cross the border between that brand of religious fanaticism and just plain pure religion. That setup then brings about the horrors later on when the full-on extent of their regulations are revealed. With the maddening manner that he has to keep his identity a secret through the time he's there on the island, there's a fine suspenseful tactic to be had with the way this one continually allows him to escape the notice of the guards who are noticeably on his trail the entire time. From being forced to wade through a stream of sewage only to confront the shrieking being underneath the water to landing in the darkened cave full of creepy hieroglyphics on the walls to the absolutely creepy sequence in the creatures' catacombs that controls the island. With a stellar finale that incorporates plenty of these elements as well as fine folk-horror elements, there's a lot to really enjoy with this one. The main issue to be had with the film is the overall length of this one as it's quite a lengthy and somewhat overlong effort. Most of that is due to the rather distressing issue of either running scenes way longer than necessary or just engaging in side-plots that aren't in the slightest bit pertinent to the story. While the idea of showing us his backstory is an important part of the film, there's no reason to include it as it runs on way too long to mean anything and the scenes of him sneaking around the island or the subplot with the young lovers together only serving to highlight how corrupt their system is. These all could've been done in far easier and shorter setups than what was presented here. Likewise, that length also means that far too much of this one manages to go unexplained or unexplored. The idea of their religion as a whole is entirely undefined other than the worship of a pagan deity, and the fact that different creatures and figures start emerging later and later in the film is completely glossed over as to what they actually are or intend to accomplish which hurts this one greatly. The need to overthrow the system and what's at stake doesn't really amount to much as there's nothing about them or what they're doing to keep the different beings satiated or what overcoming them accomplishes. This is a big stumbling block and is what holds this back the most.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Language and a clothed sex scene.",Apostle
9,Wuchakk,Mysterious first half devolves into muddled half-baked horror cheese,5,31 May 2019,"A man in 1905 Wales (Dan Stevens) goes undercover as a member of a weirdo cult to save his captive sister on an isolated island.""Apostle"" (2018) has a similar plot to ""The Wicker Man"" (1973/2006) and a setting akin to ""The Village"" (2004) and ""The Ritual"" (2017), but it's the least of these.The first half is a decent set-up; a little dull, but nice and mysterious with a fantastic setting and village set. Unfortunately, the second half devolves into half-baked horror cheese with a couple of random torture scenes to supposedly keep things ""exciting.""I was shocked at how bad the second half was -- bad flow, no finesse, ill-conceived, lack of consistency, too ambiguous -- just lousy wannabe-horror filmmaking. It's like the director needed 20 more minutes to properly tell the story, but was pressured to keep the movie as close to 2 hours as he could and so clumsily forced the footage in the second half together.Nevertheless, the movie's provocative upon reflection, particularly its commentary on human-made hybrid religions and the potential for corruption and abuse thereof. Think Jeroboam's syncretic religion when the northern kingdom of Israel broke from Judah; he concocted two golden calf idols and appointed illegitimate ""priests."" It was influenced by Judaism and featured some of its trappings, but left out the most important part (God).The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot in Wales. I would like to see a ""Director's Cut"" that runs at least 2.5 hours with all the expository footage that was unfortunately left on the cutting room floor.GRADE: C (First half B- / Second half D)",Apostle
10,trashgang,weird cult,8,27 November 2018,"Adviced by a friend to watch this Netflix horror and so I did. I ever expected a Netflix flick to be that cruel and gory.The story starts rather simple, a brother going to rescue his kidnapped sister. Going to the island where she's kept quickly this flick turns into a weird flick about some unfriendly cult. It's rather okay but once things go wrong the cult turns into a brutality that has to offer the viewer a lot of messy and gory moments. It never was boring or whatsoever even clocking in over 2 hours.For some viewers this flick can be offending once the weird people start to come in the story. And some will turn it off due the weirdness of the cult. But if you do like it bloody and messy then it's worth streaming on your Netflix account. Again, never thought that such kind of flicks would be on Netflix.

11,siderite,"Think Wicker Man, but with a more classical plot",7,25 February 2021,"I think Dan Stevens was a very good choice for this film: his haunted look, ""the eyes that have seen things"", also his rather average build which makes him more relatable. The story starts like Wicker Man, with our man going to a weird island that a weird cult settled. He wants to saves his sister, which was abducted and being ransomed for money. You see, the locals are starving, regardless of the protection of their goddess. Slowly, a combination of good old human politics and witchery is revealed while the hero must save the day.I think the ending was a bit weak, though. Too many twists, one after the other, and people behaving in a certain way just to make the story go in the right direction. Probably the writers cared more about the beginning than the ending, which was quite a mess. I think the fact that Thomas readily found allies in the community there (including the beautiful and innocent girl - you gotta have one of those, right?) also weakened the story. As for the supernatural part, it felt like a gimmick, something that could have been just as easily removed from the film without anyone missing it.Bottom line: better than your average horror and the fact that it is an era piece makes it feel more grounded. However, the more you run the setup in your head you realize better stories could have been told with the same resources. The bad ending makes the movie go down quite a lot.",Apostle
12,Robert_duder,F%$*#ng Fantastic,9,14 November 2018,"I settled down for a movie night and I felt like a great horror flick, it had been too long. I turned to my Netflix queue and started Apostle right away. I never could have dreamt what I was in for. It has remnants of a dozen different horror films really and captures all that wrapped in a period piece of the early 1900's. The film is over the top at times and twisted beyond belief and is a story about a brother trying to save his sister but then that ends up as the secondary story to this twisted tale of a cult and a goddess and this bizarre connection to it all. The direction on this film is breathtakingly brilliant. There are scenes that are so stunning they are reminiscent of some of the best foreign horror films I've seen. It also doesn't hold back from being gory and vile and torturous and at the same time held at least once scene that genuinely got under my skin and creeped me out. I can't remember the last time I had to turn away from a movie and also be truly scared.
Dan Stevens headlines the cast and does so very well. It's interesting because his character isn't exactly hero material and he's not likeable and yet you understand him and you get what he's going through. He plays the role perfectly broody and dark. The support cast is also fantastic. Michael Sheen who is just an expert at character portrayals is amazing as the Prophet Malcolm. Mark Lewis Jones is fantastic as the villainous Quinn. Kristine Froseth, Lucy Boynton, Sharon Morgan, Elen Rhys and Bill Milner all have very strong supporting roles and really add to the ambiance of the film. The ensemble cast works very well together and have terrific chemistry and even in small doses they all have character development to make them interesting.
To me this is the type of film that should pop up at the Emmy's or Oscars or whatever it's eligible for. The direction is breathtaking. It doesn't surprise me that it comes from a European director as the style is distinctly European which I love. Gareth Edwards has already made something of a name for himself for smaller projects like The Raid, The Raid 2, V/H/S 2 and the like. There are multiple moments of grand cinematography or close up shots and shots that make you feel the openness of a space or the claustrophobia of a situation and place. This film is near perfection. I think my only complaint is it really starts to get wild and crazy at the end and loses a little bit of footing but it's still one of the best horror thrillers I've seen in ages. I expect to see this on my top ten list for 2018.

13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A trifle overlong, but still a worthwhile mystery",7,4 November 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1905, Thomas Richardson (Dan Stevens), a man whose sister has been abducted and has been sent a ransom note, travels to a remote island to rescue her. There, he encounters a devout religious community, held together by the venerable Prophet Malcolm (Michael Sheen), who preaches of a new society founded on new principles. But as Thomas digs deeper into what binds this place together, he discovers a truth more devastating than he can imagine.Probably most famous before now for his foreign language efforts, most notably the martial arts capers The Raid 1 and 2, Welsh director Gareth Evans here turns to his native language (sort of) and has a stab at the horror genre, delving into the world of religious cults and paganism, with more than a passing nod to The Wicker Man about it. He's also settled on a period piece, in the early 1900's, giving his work a more grounded setting. The result is an effective, if ostracizing and slightly overlong piece.While it spends much of its early time establishing a mood and capturing an atmosphere, the pace of the film does tend to linger at times, not helped by running at over two hours, when trimming it by twenty or thirty minutes might have made it more condensable. But Evans keeps the Saw generation in mind, and certainly doesn't skimp on the blood and gore, drawing gasps from the viewer with sudden, unexpected scenes of blood letting that draw from the more medieval background.While it may be a bit too weighty and heavy for some, and the length is an issue, it's still a highly effective and worthwhile piece, with commanding lead performances from two of the gradually more accomplished modern greats. ***",Apostle
14,MOscarbradley,Torture porn but very well done....,7,10 March 2020,"Torture porn from Gareth Evans, the man who gave us ""The Raid"" and its sequel. ""Apostle"" certainly scores top marks both for weirdness and extreme nastiness and with its island setting and strange religious cult it should remind you of ""The Wicker Man"" but that's really where the similarities end. This is a much darker chiller as Dan Stevens heads off to rescue his sister who has been kidnapped by cult leader Michael Sheen only to find that things are even worse than he imagined. Apart from the excessive gore Evans over-eggs the pudding in terms of plot so it isn't always that easy to follow and it isn't helped by Stevens' grim performance. On the other hand, Sheen has a field day as one of the bad guys and it certainly looks great. At 130 minutes it's a tad on the long side but it's certainly not lacking in imagination and I can see cult status beckoning.",Apostle
15,bowmanblue,A witch is for life (not just for a pagan festival),6,18 October 2018,"You know how it is... you buy a witch for your children when it's young. Sure, it's cute with its little broomstick and pointed green nose, but soon the kids grow up and only want a cell phone and Snapchat account. And you find you're the one left feeding and looking after the confused elderly woman who doesn't know whether to pet her black cat or boil her cauldron. What do you do with her? Flush her down the toilet and run the risk of her mutating in a sewer into a giant witch, or drive her out to the middle of nowhere and dump her, leaving yourself open to allegations of 'witch abuse.' No, the best thing to do is lock her up out of site and occasionally feed her then pretend like nothing ever happened. Welcome to 'Apostle' - Netflix's latest original horror film.Only it's not present day, it's roughly a hundred years ago and the whole thing feels like someone has watched 'The Wicker Man' (the original, not the one with 'The bees! The bees'! Not the bees in my eyes!') and kind of changed a few things around. A man from mainland Britain (Dan Stevens) travels to a 'backward' island off the coast to find a missing girl. There, he discovers the settlement isn't quite as perfect as people have led him to believe.I know I'm being a bit flippant about the whole storyline, but it's actually pretty watchable, especially if you already have Netflix and are into horror - then it's a definite watch. Dan Stevens does well to 'roughen' his natural good looks and make himself appear more dishevelled throughout the whole film and he's a good leading man. The head villagers are suitably bonkers and when we see the more 'otherworldly' inhabitants, they're done with make-up rather than CGI, which is nice.What's definitely worth a mention is the cinematography, which is pretty amazing. I'm not sure where this was filmed, but it really does look an amazingly beautify location and the set is built to replicate the time period perfectly. The scenery and establishing shots look so crisp the almost reminded me of some sort of Playatation 4 cut-scene which has been rendered to look that good.The film's does suffer from being a little on the long side - two hours, rather than the more 'standard' ninety minutes and there's probably at least quarter of an hour that could have been cut to move things along a bit. There are a few sub-plots which could have been trimmed to accomplish this. But, all in all, it's a good, atmospheric, slow-burner of a horror film which many should enjoy.",Apostle
16,Platypuschow,"Apostle: Starts strong, trails off",5,13 December 2018,"Apostle is another Netflix original, a collaboration between UK and US production companies and is certainly a memorable tale.It tells the story of a man who visits a secluded island housed by a mysterious cult that have kidnapped his sister. But beneath the visage is something even more sinister than he could have possibly imagined.It comes under the horror genre, I question that. Is it really? Thriller seems to suit it better.Starring Michael Sheen in a truly excellent performance by him this grisly, dark, moody little film really got my attention early on but by about half way it seemed to have lost its way. Like the writer had a good idea but didn't know how to follow through with it.I'm not saying Apostle is a bad movie, it has some great themes and looks great but from an entertainment perspective it finds itself somewhat lacking. I'm not a person who needs everything spelling out for him, I don't mind things being left open to interpretation but there is a fine line between that and just leaving things a tad too open.Apostle is a watchable effort with some nice ideas but as for what they were actually aiming for I think it's a swing and a miss.

17,Thanos_Alfie,Fantasy...,5,14 June 2020,"""Apostle"" is a Fantasy - Horror movie in which we watch a man going to an isolated island where a religious cult is based in order to find and rescue his sister from his kidnappers.Since I had already watched the trailer of this movie I had high expectation from it, unfortunately I was a bit disappointed by it. Despite its interesting plot and some good interpretations, it bored me due to its duration which I found very long for that kind of movie. Its long duration made the movie boring and hard to follow it until the end. The direction which was made by Gareth Evans who is also the writer, was good, interesting and he presented very well the story but I believe that due to the duration of the film he created some plot holes which he was not able to cover. Finally, I have to say that ""Apostle"" is a good - average movie that had the potential of being great but failed.",Apostle
18,eddie_baggins,"Disturbing and unsettling, a horror not for the faint of heart",6,16 October 2018,"It's been a long time between drinks for Welsh director Gareth Evans, who last unleashed a serious bought of kinetic energy onto the cinema going public with his brilliant, brutal and bloodthirsty action epic The Raid 2 in 2014.In between these long drinks, Evan's has dismissed the possibility of a third and final Raid film and had a large scale action film he was working on collapsed before filming begun, so it's great to finally see what Evans has in store for us with his newest film and first English language feature Apostle.Released through streaming giant Netflix, Apostle is Evan's love letter to genre classics Wicker Man and Witchfinder General and for anyone that found themselves enamoured with those religiously tinged horror's, Apostle will be a film you instantly connect with, just prepare for more blood and brief but exhilarating snippets of violence of which permeated throughout The Raid film's and made them the heart racing exercises they ended up being.Apostle feels cut from the same cloth as Evan's breakout hits and also feels very close to Evan's short film Safe Haven from 2013's V/H/S 2 horror anthology outing, but unfortunately this unnerving and often terrifying yarn sees Evan's bite of more than he can chew, as an initially intriguing and dread-filled set-up gives way to an increasingly far-fetched plot-line that features some of the year's most horrifying scenes, not for the squeamish or faint of heart.Creating a lived in island environment as Dan Steven's wide-eyed and highly strung Thomas Richardson finds himself living in a cultish early 1900's community run by Michael Sheen's Prophet Malcolm, as he searches for his kidnapped sister, Apostle allows Evans to craft a film filled with an ominous and realistic world but problems begin to become apparent and more prominent as the films runtime ticks along and the oddities Thomas comes across get more and more fanciful.It's hard to connect on any real emotional level here with characters barely established as Evans instead focuses his attention on a more visceral experience.Through this Evan's succeeds as he holds back little from the horror's that lurk beneath the surface of Prophet Malcolm's ""paradise"" with Apostle delivering some of the years more freighting and horrifying scenes that will keep gore-hounds more than sufficed; scenes featuring a ""purification"" and a swim in a unappealing body of water likely to go down as some of 2018's movie images you can't wipe from your memory.Final Say - Featuring a bonkers and all in lead turn from Dan Stevens, Apostle is a mild disappoint from Evan's who had a tough act to follow thanks to the Raid double bill.

20,digitalbeachbum,Metaphors only work when they teach a logical conclusion,1,13 January 2019,"Mixing religions and ideas from different eras and communities does not work. It's like mixing water with oil. They don't mix. You shake them up and it appears they are thoroughly mixed, but when you let it sit, the oil separates and your efforts are wasted.This movie is about mankind and religion. It mixes christianity with a variety of other mythological folklore, such as witchcraft. This is failure number one because the mixing of the religions doesn't work. You can't mix water and oil together.The movie also has poor character development. You have a leader who is supposed to be in full command of the island. He has these ""warrior guards"" who are willing to defend him against an assassin. You also have some followers who listen intently and follow his every command. Then a few scenes later, they all go against him for no reason. Everything falls apart and is forced because the director and/or the writer(s) don't understand about natural development of their characters. It was rushed and forced, just so they could get from the beginning to the end. There was no middle. Failure number two.The idea of blood giving to plants is an ancient one, but this movie apparently has the entire life of the island related to the blood of a few individuals. Blood was supposed to be, on many levels, an elixir , which could be poisoned or cleansed.You also see an evil man giving his blood to the witch. This would be poison and not nourishment. It is confusing and shows that the writer(s) and directors didn't understand the ancient myths about how blood was used in their rituals.It wasn't that one drop of it could make whole crops grow. It was one drop for one drop. Equal parts. This movie makes it that one drop will solve all the problems of the island.After the which is burned you see the guards are all impaled in the trees and there is confusion. People appear to be leaving or running away. The girls escape to a boat and there is a explosion with a waterfall of blood in to the ocean? Too much symbolism, to much confusion. No explanation of the situation, no character development, no resolving the story.My final beef with the story is that the the ""savior"" guy then takes the place of the witch, thus saving the island and the cult. You see the leader realizing that he has a new witch who he can exploit and use to save his religion.All in all, the movie felt like they were trying to push a square peg in through a round hole. They rushed everything, they lacked proper character explanation and development. It did have a few interesting scenes, but the characters didn't have any motivation. They lacked continuity. They seemed pushed through the movie to do things just to make a scene happen.It sucked. I could write a better story and I did so. I wrote a short story about a witch who would trick people in to her home and then she would use their bodies to grow food, which she later sold at market, back to the villagers who bullied her. She was finally caught, executed, and the village died because none of the crops would produce enough food for them.",Apostle

There is one particular ritualistic killing scene. That made me cringe man.

24,jtindahouse,Supernatural element ruins a decent thing,5,16 October 2018,"Ask most people what the most fearful entity in the universe is and they'll likely say monsters, zombies or aliens etc. but I personally think the most scary thing out there is religion. Why? Because it is real. And make no mistake it is terrifying, because of what it makes good people do and what it can turn them into. That's why I was particularly disappointed 'Apostle' decided to have a supernatural element to it. Instead of it being a commentary on how evil religion can become, and how cult leaders can possess people, it almost justifies the decisions made by these characters. The supernatural side of things ruins an otherwise adequate film.The film gets off to an interesting start, then stalls in the middle and then tries to make up for it by finishing with a bang. There are some very tense and brutal scenes woven into the mix, but they are too few and far between. I think they felt they had to keep the runtime reasonably long in order to give it some merit as an 'epic' of sorts, but to me it would have been a lot better off cutting 20-30 minutes of filler. All in all this was a pretty forgettable film that could have been something decent with the odd tweak here and there. Not much to see here.",Apostle
25,kevin_robbins,This isn't a perfect movie and the ending could have been a little better but I enjoyed watching the movie unfold,7,14 May 2021,"Apostle (2018) is a movie I recently caught on Netflix that centers around a brother long lost and believed to be dead by his family. He returns home to London to discover his sister has been kidnapped and held for randsome by a religious cult. Since everyone thought the brother was dead he seems to be the perfect person to try and infiltrate the cult and rescue his sister. Apostle is directed by Gareth Evans (The RAID 1 & 2) and stars Dan Stevens (The Guest), Richard Elfyn (Killer Elite), Paul Higgins (Utopia) and Bill Milner (Son of Rambow). The storyline is interested and reminded me of Hereditary just not as good. The acting, settings, props, costumes and kill scenes are all outstanding and very well assembled and executed. The acting was also solid and the storyline is worth following. This isn't a perfect movie and the ending could have been a little better but I enjoyed watching the movie unfold.

However, the best part of this film is the slower first 30 minutes where the mystery around both Stevens and the community is allowed to build nicely - at this point it really holds your interest. Thereafter the whole thing goes off in various directions culminating in a final third act which is so crazy you either buy into it 100% or think it's a bit silly - I rather went with the latter.",Apostle

Dan Stevens gives an excellent intense performance as does the crazy sinister nutter leader of the village, the ""Prophet"" played greatly by Michael Sheen, a very different role for him as a brutal ruler.

28,Pairic,Good Horror,8,12 October 2018,"Apostle: A truly savage Horror Film which only falls down on it's excessive running time. Thomas (Dan Stevens) goes to an isolated island to track down his sister who has been abducted by a strange religious cult, they worship She, the Goddess of the Island. The religion was founded by three men who claim to be escaped felons, imprisoned for treason. The leader (and Prophet) of the Cult is Malcolm (Michael Sheen), he preaches a gospel of sharing and equality, the island is presented as a refuge for the down trodden. It soon becomes obvious that Malcolm has a group of enforcers who see that his orders are carried out and who seek out dissent and blasphemy.Thomas saves Malcolm from an assassins dagger and gains his trust. Wounded in the attack, thomas is nursed by Malcolm's daughter Andrea (Lucy Boynton) who is independent minded. As Malcolm and his deputy Quinn (Mark Lewis Jones) discover the conveyor of the ransom is on the island and seek him out. Getting crazier and crazier, going from mere repressive Theocrats to mad Prophets.Apostle is reminiscent of The Wicker Man at times with the need to appease a Deity to secure the harvest and also has Lovecraftian influences involving the worship of a Sea Goddess; it even made me think of the recent Cold Skin. Torture, murder and ritual execution abound and this is not a film for the squeamish. The tension builds but at times Thomas (an ex-priest) goes into asides regarding his lack of belief. But he does become a one-man army determined to rescue his sister and vanquish the Cult leaders and their thugs.A good Horror Film rather than a great one is delivered by director and screenwriter Garth Evans. Apostle might well benefit from a cut of perhaps 20 minutes in the 130 minutes running time. 7.5/10. On Netflix.",Apostle

32,peterp-450-298716,A bit of suspense and a tad horror.,7,29 November 2018,"These people...
they're blasphemers...
a cult, a disease.
Be careful. Be smart.
Bring her home.The first thing that came to my mind while watching ""Apostle"", was the movie ""The Witch"". It takes place in the same time period. Here, too, an old-fashioned sounding English is spoken. And it's also a religion-tinted theme. The biggest difference with ""The Witch"" is that I thought that one was rather boring and not a horror at all. It was more a historical costume drama. ""Apostle"" is, on the other hand, simply sublime. A mysterious film about religious madness. Not only content wise but also visually it all looks perfect And the facet of horror was indeed present. And no, not only because of the bloody and gore scenes. There's only one thing that puzzled me afterward. What was it that the people of Erisden worshiped?It all starts when Thomas Richardson (Dan Stevens) is asked by his father to rescue his sister Jennifer (Elen Rhys) from the grasp of an obscure sect. She's kidnapped. And a large ransom is demanded. Thomas himself was once a sort of missionary spreading God's word in the land of the rising sun. His experiences there, however, made sure that he got an aversion to everything that has to do with religion. Without further delay, he takes on the assignment to save his sister from the gang of fanatics and bring her back home.The running time of ""Apostle"" is 2 hours. Perhaps this is too much of a good thing for a horror with religion as a central topic. But believe me. Those two hours are over before you know it. Every sense of time is absent when viewing this captivating film. And this because of the excellent way of build up. The first hour you'll be carried away in the enigmatic life on the island of Erisden. Beautiful images are interspersed with scenes from the daily life of this primitive living commune. Soon it's clear that this sect developed a peculiar kind of faith with their own rituals (and despotic rules). Just as in any religion, a limited number of individuals rule and decide how to behave in this community. They are also the only ones who know what's going on there.The reason why they abducted the daughter of a rich man is that their provisions are drastically reduced due to bad harvests and they are gradually heading towards a shortage of food. Prophet Malcolm (Michael Sheen) tries to turn the tide in a certain way but finally, he has to realize that he's helplessly watching how his patiently built community gradually crumbles. Despite the sometimes rather barbaric punishments that have been introduced to keep the community under control, Malcolm seems to be a peaceful man who's worried about the welfare of the islanders. More peaceful than some of his confidants who show a certain hunger for power and who, if the opportunity presents itself, try to claim leadership without delay.The characters Thomas and Malcolm are played in a brilliant way by Dan Stevens and Michael Sheen. Malcolm isn't really a cruel despot, though he's the driving force behind the terrible process of cleansing. And even though Thomas has to be careful while tracking down his sister, he immediately disobeys imposed rules and expresses his doubts about Malcolm towards the prophet's daughter. Michael Sheen (who played a more funny role in ""Passengers"" as the robotic butler Arthur) and Dan Stevens were perfectly cast. I especially liked Dan Stevens (""Kill Switch"", ""The Ticket"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""). Even though his grim and furious look started to get boring at a certain moment. There are also a few other characters that are worth mentioning. First, there are Bill Milner and Kristine Froseth who take care of the idyllic part. Then there's Lucy Boynton as Andrea, the daughter of the Prophet. It's not the most important role, but her appearance is in sharp contrast with the rest of the film. A dazzling beauty with a refreshing look. She looks like a fragile porcelain doll. And finally Mark Lewis Jones as Quinn, co-founder of this sect and in hindsight also a fanatic. Each and every one was an interesting character.""Apostle"" is certainly not for sensitive viewers. Not that it 's really frightening (except maybe for the sewer scene). But there are some distasteful scenes that can be quite shocking for some. Especially in the second part of the film. It's filled with sadistic torture practices where the accompanying sounds cause chills. This in contrast to the first part that you can call atmospheric. It's difficult to label this movie with a specific film genre. But do you like a bit of suspense? A tad of horror? And pagan religious scenes? Well then, this folk-horror movie is definitely your thing. At least one of the better Netflix productions so far.More reviews here : movie-freak.be",Apostle

Stevens poses as a new convert to figure out where his sister is being held and slowly learns that these seemingly friendly folks are hiding some very dark secrets. Without ruining anything, think ""The Wicker Man"" meets the surreal savageness of ""Mandy."" The film was written and directed by Gareth Evans, who made the mind-blowing action film ""The Raid,"" and he brings equal style and flare to this film, but he does dial down the dizzying stylistics of his action films in favor of building an unsettling atmosphere and growing dread. Although Evans' fevered dream style of storytelling is the real star of the film, Steven is excellent in the lead and manages to remain a compelling protagonist throughout the film, keep character at the film's center.

37,arungeorge13,'Apostle' - More V.H.S 2's 'Safe Haven'-like Gareth Evans than The Raid movies. [+65%],7,14 October 2018,"Usually, when I notice some of my favorite directors (or franchises) associating themselves with NetFlix, the result has always turned out to be subpar. 'Apostle' is one of the exceptions. It isn't the best film by Gareth Evans (not by a long shot), however, it cleverly blends various horror sub-genres in a story set in the early 1900s. The setting is a beautiful and eerie Welsh island, which is cut off from the rest of civilization and run by a cultist leader Malcolm (played by Michael Sheen). Thomas (Dan Stevens) arrives at the island pretending to be a follower of Malcolm's, in the hopes of rescuing his kidnapped sister who, apparently, is held up somewhere around. The film kicks off more along the lines of 'Wicker Man' but the comparisons end there. The surprises that Evans throws in the viewer's face every now and then make you wonder what kind of intriguing horror concoction the director was trying to create in the first place. Did he have these genre-bending ideas when he first sat down to write the script?This is a film that manages to include the story of an island Goddess, her creepy caretaker, a bunch of unnerving cultists, a few women such as Ffion and Andrea who have (and at times, poignantly express their) desires to live a happy life outside the boundaries of the cult, and the desperate/struggling Thomas without any sort of compromises in character development, pacing, tone, and building tension. This slow-burn thriller offers a couple of nods to The Raid movies in terms of shot choices (at certain important junctures) and some gritty violence. Do not expect an action-filled finale (although it sort of gives you hints when the climax approaches) but embrace it more from a storyline-completion perspective, and there are chances that you'd enjoy 'Apostle' almost the same way I did.Dan Stevens as Thomas (quite an odd choice, maybe because he's an English actor?) sometimes fails to convey the agony and despair that the character has to go through. His expression-set is rather limited but his stature and English visage/accent ideally fit the bill I suppose. The rest of the cast fall into their roles with certain ease, especially Sheen. Other striking aspects of the film include in-your-face imagery by cinematographer Matt Flannery (of the Raid movies) and superb background score by Fajar Yusekemal and Aria Prayogi.Some viewers are bound to write 'Apostle off as a snoozefest (I'm sure) due to its slow-burn elements, but if you enjoy flicks based on cults with a supernatural backstory (also featuring plenty of gore and viscera), you'll find the flick steadily growing on you. I would love to see Gareth Evans craft an action horror flick a la 'The Purge', 'Cloverfield' or 'Upgrade' in the near future.",Apostle

44,SoumikBanerjee25,Unfulfilled Potential!,6,15 September 2020,"""Apostle"" is beautifully shot & in a similarly gorgeous location that undeservingly finds its merits only in blood & gore. The characterization is where it particularly falters the most!
Another Netflix original with unscathed potential; deliberately wasted due to overambitious nature of the makers.
For the first act, we have been introduced to the characters one by one, slow progression with enough errieness to satisfy our deeds.
In the second act, it starts to heavily rely on the gore aspect. Although I like their efforts as I have always been an admirer of unsettling, disturbing things! More so in horror films. You can call it my ""Niche"" if you say so!
Having said that, I still feel that the film had lots of other good things to offer. That didn't come to light as the makers were so busy indulging themselves in raw blood!Performances are decent, but characterizations aren't. I don't feel any sort of connection nor empathy towards any of those characters. Especially pointing out the brother-sister relationship between Thomas & Jennifer. The bond was absent, their characters never got developed. Which should have been the utmost priority keeping the premise in mind.Talking about the cult and their beliefs. Well not going into much details; I just wanna say it lacked enough clarifications. Absence of a proper backstory affected its mere existence. Whereas the creepy vibe was consistent; the screenplay wasn't.So in short, it's a fine watch, definitely not for the faint hearted.

Seems no one knows what this is supposed to be about. Sadly folks if you are looking for an explanation of this mess you won't find it here. BUT I DO have LOTS of questions and observations.Michael Sheen-does he have psoriasis on his head and face or was that for effect? Those red marks on his scalp and patches of red skin showing through his beard were distracting.How did these people (the original set) get on the island in the first place? Who were they before they got there? We don't know thus we can't get invested.Dan Stevens gets a huge slice on his arm yet he's back to work in short order?What were they planning on doing with the ransom if they are in the middle of the ocean?The sheep giving birth was disturbing. I hate to see animals be harmed even if it is fake.If Dan Stevens had truly been burnt with a cross that big for as long as he had - he would've have a much bigger scar than what he had.DS was despicable in that he allowed another man to die instead of him. Also he isn't a bad actor but all that looking up from his eyes the entire time was weird and made him look nuts. What were the sounds he was hearing and why did he take that liquid stuff? To help with pain or to help him not be unstable?They could have pre-marital sex, drink and dance but had to be in by a curfew. Yet no one went around to check on anyone to enforce it?!They just tried to make it as gory as possible but it seemed like it was done for effect and not because it made sense to the story.How can people believe in a cult if they are being tortured and ruled and told what to do?All DS near misses were just too implausible. He's able to figure out that his ticket is marked and can switch it just in time to board. He's saved before he gets outed in the church. He's spared by the gunshot from Frank. He's spared being shot by that beehive headpiece wearing thing even though he was so obvious. He avoids getting caught trying to break into the area under the house. He avoids getting fed into that machine. He gets attacked but the sister and daughter intervene before he is finished off. Nobody gets that lucky over and over - all fodder to move the story along.Why the heck didn't he look around while he was saving his sister to avoid getting attacked? They were so close to making it.Also sister has been hanging in a bag for days? No food or water yet she's able to pull a chain out of the wall and walk/run all the way to the boat. Right.Everyone looks terrible but Lucy Boynton-full makeup?! Puh-lease! Even at the end she still looks fresh after all they've been through. This is a consistent thing with Hollywood - these actresses claim they want to go full method in everything but their hair and makeup. It's so unrealistic and obvious. Lucy's hair could not have been that way without a curling iron.Michael Sheen gets shot and falls down a hole yet he walks all the way to the hill at the end where it implies he continues to live?!I liked the premise but the execution was sorely lacking.

48,johannes2000-1,Chilling gothic horror with very strong acting.,8,24 October 2018,"I liked it, but at the end I felt probably as exasperated and exhausted as main character Richardson (Dan Stevens) did, I mean, how much gruesomeness can you heap up on a person (or the audience)!! It was as if the makers couldn't make a choice out-of all the options of sufferings and tortures and simply decided to use them all. It maybe could have used a little bit more restraint on that account. As did the length of the movie, more than 2 hours was really too much, it inevitably caused the tension to sag somewhere at two thirds of the story. I also would have liked a little bit more background, there's like 3 minutes of introduction and wham, we're full-blown into the main story.But apart from that, I cannot deny that this is an original and very well acted movie. It's visually beautiful, the landscapes at the beginning are breathtaking (apparently filmed in Wales) and I liked the dialogues, all done in the over-civilized English idiom of the turn of the century that these religious fanatics used. There are no real scares, it's all about creepy and sinister atmosphere, but the violence is abundant, with one extremely chilling execution-scene. And then there is this mixture of realistic horror, due to the the power-hungry leaders of the community, with a super-natural storyline, maybe a bit too much for some, but for me it totally worked.Dan Stevens very convincingly plays a good-for-nothing bum turned into a hero in spite of himself, and he succeeds in making you care for him, although he's very unsympathetic (and for instance can be hold responsible for the corruption and later-on downfall of poor young Frank).

Then it was an interesting enough story of a man trying to infiltrate a cult to get his sister out who had been kidnapped. Seemed like the plot lost some steam after a while though although the goal was always the same I suppose. There was a power struggle inside the cult eventually and then some odd supernatural elements that didn't really seem to fit.

51,PyroSikTh,"Slow, Tense, Surprising",8,10 May 2021,"Apostle follows Thomas Richardson, son of wealth, who sneaks into an island-borne cult in order to ransom back his kidnapped sister. The first half of the movie follows him as he attempts to avoid detection while simultaneously trying to find the location of his sister, make sure she's alive, and hopefully get her out safely. What he uncovers is something far more fantastical. The first thing that surprised me about this movie is how well-developed members of the cult were. While Thomas is obviously the main character and the whole plot hinges on him and his actions, the movie takes time to develop the three founders of the cult and their familial relationships, including a teenage love affair, and the daughter of the cult's leader who doesn't buy into it as hard as the rest of the settlement. The film also digs into how and why the cult was formed, giving us flashbacks dotted about of the three founders landing on the island and uncovering an entity living there.Which brings me nicely to the second thing that surprised me about this movie. While the first half of the movie is dedicated to building up a mystery surrounding the supernatural forces at work on the island, it doesn't drag it out too long, revealing that the founders took advantage of a deity-like figure who gave them bountiful harvests in exchange for blood sacrifices. Many cult movies around at most only flirt with the idea that there's something supernatural and legitimate supporting their beliefs, but Apostle goes out of its way to confirm that that is exactly what's going on here. The founders' manipulation and forced feeding of the goddess creates this interesting commentary on how mankind treats mother nature. It's not a theme the movie goes particularly hard into exploring, but it's there, bubbling beneath the surface; the greed of mankind, exploiting mother nature and taking advantage of what she has to offer, without consideration of what's best for her, and the depravities we sink to when mother nature fights back (with, for instance, climate change). When their crops start dying and their livestock stop birthing, they take matters into their own hands and push the mandates of their cult to the limit.This was refreshing for a sub-genre that usually wants to make a point of how far humanity can fall when misguided and fearful, driven by mob rule. The vast majority of people in this cult are just people; friendly, kind, and accepting. Even the leader is described as soft and sincerely apologises to a newcomer who suffers a case of mistaken identity. At absolute worst, they're just desperate. Even the ultimate antagonist of the movie does what he does out of sheer desperation and grief. There's little malice or evil here. Of course the antagonist crosses that line at the end, resorting to murder, kidnapping, and the promise of rape, but up until that point they comes across as a genuinely nice and harmless cult.Those expecting a full-on gory action romp from Gareth Evans are sure to be disappointed though. This movie has a pretty slow (but never uninteresting) burn. It's well over halfway into the movie's runtime when we get our first fight scene, and there's really only a couple of scenes of gore worth mentioning. I will cede though that those two moments of gore are pretty bad; not quite enough to earn a 'torture porn' label, but not far off. The moment that will probably haunt me (and most people) most from this movie is the moment one of the most likeable supporting characters is strapped to a table and has his brains gauged out as some kind of screwed up and unjust punishment at the hands of the antagonist. And yet the actual gore level for this scene is nowhere near as bad as that description implies. It's just uncomfortable to watch.On a more technical merit, this film is such a huge success I'm surprised more people aren't talking about it. The acting, cinematography, and score is plenty worth shouting about. Dan Stevens is fantastic as Thomas, showing how much depth he's truly capable of as an actor. He plays Thomas as somewhat unhinged and unpredictable at the beginning, but as we learn more of his backstory, he starts to come off more as a hardened individual who's been through a lot. Michael Sheen potentially steals the show as Malcolm, the cult's leader, somehow making a character who would be typically easy to hate remarkably sympathetic. The romance between Bill Milner's Jeremy and Kristine Froseth's Ffion is charmingly endearing, Paul Higgins' Frank is the most likeable of the founders, while Mark Lewis Jones is just as scary and intimidating as always.The cinematography is full of great moments and shots, in no small thanks to the set-designers and location scouts. The choice of island is fantastic; remote and imposing with sheer vistas, and the authentic homes built by the cult have that homemade but sturdy feel to them. My favourite shots are in the entity's holding barn, with roots and branches blanketing the walls, creating a weird visual juxtaposition between the natural habitat and the artificial lighting. The score is really creative as well, opening with the discordant choir to set you up for what's to come, punctuating the tenser/more action driven moments with interesting percussive choices, and when everything comes crashing down before the final climax, the slightly out-of-tune piano matches Thomas' disorientation and emotional response perfectly. I'm just gutted I can't seem to find it anywhere to actually listen to, otherwise I would've no doubt gone into much more depth.Apostle was a big surprise for me. I went in expecting a harrowing yet unremarkable cult movie, and instead what I got was more imagination, creativity, world-building, and well-developed sympathetic characters than I could ever have anticipated. The movie is long, does take a bit to get going, and adamantly refuses to explain certain details (such as the entity's keeper), but none of this particularly bothered me (especially as refusing to explain something is not a plot hole, it's just an unresolved mystery, and sometimes it's okay to leave some things as a mystery by the time the credits roll). It's beautiful to look at, great to listen to, remarkably well-acted, and I can't wait to see what else will come from the mind of Gareth Evans. I give Apostle a very comfortable 8/10.",Apostle
52,Offworld_Colony,"For just over half its (excessive) running time Apostle was a well shot, well edited creepy Edwardian fusion of Bioshock Infinite and The Wicker Man,",6,17 February 2020,"With a well paced and efficiently set-up ongoing mystery and a slew of tremendous actors.It's a film that begins by touching upon cults and community and freedom from society; with some great characterisations of the cult and particularly Sheen's character and the interactions with his 'brothers' that are interesting and intriguing. And Dan Stephens has never been more watchable, looking grubby and shifty, channeling a sultry, deep videogame voice-over voice.But unfortunately when most of its intended mysteries are revealed, the film crushes under the weight of its blended influences, its director's desires, and maybe even what I imagine was a bloated budget for what it was.These types of films only really work when the incredibly subjective and reasonably limitless potential of the reveal works. And in Apostle the combined lack of clarity and focus of the horror at work is somehow even more unsatisfying than the look of the actual monster itself.Is it a supernatural videogame inspired Silent Hill movie? Is it a crime movie about three charlatan brothers masquerading as a cult? Is it a detective Wicker-Man type British thriller? A commentary on Brexit(?!) Is it a torture movie? Too many clashing elements leave too many things unexplained in a bad way.Most of the issues seem to stem from the Director. And considering he was the director of The raid and the extremely gory The Raid 2, I expected it to be sadistic and gory, and it is in spades. Some are creative and clever (blood in the POV eyes of a cracked skull anyone?) But most are deeply disturbing, meaningless and unjustified within the story and just plain ugly. You can kill and torture children if it has some bearing on the themes and points of the film, if the film is saying something important. But Apostle's violence seems cringingly just there to satiate the desires of Garth Evans.The atmosphere and the music are all pitch perfect, although I would have preferred a little less overly-loud screeching over shots of dark buildings, and the films efficient opening and tremendous setting and sets draws you in unquestionably, but what it does is it squanders your attention on torture and too much nonsense. It takes your love of the first half, and turns it in to a meandering, rushed mess.With that comes too many false endings; it's clear a film is strung together badly at the back end when lead characters keep getting knocked out over and over again. And part of that seems to come from the writing; It seems that the original draft may have been a Wicker Man type Brit-chiller about three brothers setting up a cult where some kind of British demon of old lives. But then Garth Evans comes along and wants to show the demon clearly, but doesn't want to do any research or world-building in to it, wants to make it about torture and gore and wants to make it sadistic for the sake of messing with the audience.There's a tacked on festival-cheer moment that always makes me cringe when, to fit in with the #metoo movement, two women have to be belittled and pointlessly threatened with sexual abuse and chained up just so they can 'get their revenge' on him so the audience can hurrah. It isn't earned and is emblematic of what's wrong with this movie: The director wanting make things cool and OTT (see: the action sequences) instead of something that can enter in to memorable B-movie pantheon.Too much and too little explanation, (why the brain-drilling device on the island and the law if Sheen's character's never murdered anyone), too many different kinds of influences and none gelling well, pointless scenes (Peking flashback), logical inconsistencies (who is that guy with a basket head). And many more issues drag down what is a solid start and possible proof that Garth Evans has some range in him somewhere. Maybe he could do Universal horror movie or something.",Apostle

The vague plot portrayed in the most amateur of ways causing confusion not by sophistication, but by pure incoherence? The pitch black lighting forcing you to either stop and tweak your screen's brightness to never-before-necessary levels or simply not see anything? The screen time dedicated to anything and everything but the actual story, supposing this mess of allegedly consistent events can even be defined as one? Or perhaps the nothing short of foolish ending bluntly hammering that final nail into the film's coffin? I'd describe all in further detail had it been worth my time (or yours for that matter), but I feel after the two hours it took to watch this mixture of irrelevance and black screens that I have paid my dues.There are some good parts, yes. Most notably before the actual film during the opening credits, which take about 20 seconds before the first actual footage. That's how it should be done, that's how you create immersion from the get go (if you put aside the fact that this isn't part of the actual film, which later deems this singular light spot redundant at best). Also, if you enjoy pointless blood and gore and a little torture porn for its own sake - you'll find some enjoyable scenes. I didn't.I am not the least surprised that this is rated above 6 (very high for a Horror film on this site, as it seems certain people simply experience acute pleasure by rating Horror low for the heck of it), as that's just how IMDB goes. Horror gems are rated 4, and this is rated 6.3. Oh well, whatever rocks your bored infantile boat. As frustrated as I am by my wasted time, I still try to be a little fair. So a 3 instead of a 1.

I was expecting a sort of mashup of ""The VVitch"" and ""Wicker man"" (the original, of course), but what I got is a sort of a Lovecraftian ""Wicker man"", which is totally not bad. Let's start with the pros: amazing cinematography, decent acting, intriguing settings and well-done gore & fight scenes. That's enough pros to make a movie average or better than that. But what was wrong? Mainly pacing & plot. This could've easily been a 90minutes long horror flick, without losing much of the atmosphere. ""The Apostle"" was shook by a set-up too long, consisting of many uninterrupted long shots, walking, watching, staring etc., they were making suspense and doing an overkill at that. What about the plot? It's engaging enough (just enough), but ultimately fails to deliver some answers to some burning questions.

61,tesswysko,"Not your typical horror, nor suspense movie!",8,22 April 2019,"First off, I'd like to state that the first synopsis saying that Thomas is a Drifter is incorrect. He had been in the military and came home to find his father had gotten a ransom letter for his sister from a cult who had kidnapped her.His father was too elderly to go so there attache told Thomas to go and take the money but don't give it to them until after he's seen that his sister is safe. He goes to this island where this religious cult is based out of and finds that this is a very small island and there's only two row boats going in and out. The Cult is led by a religious leader but there's also a struggle going on with a man who is more of a militaristic leader. They are very paranoid especially when they found that Thomas's ticket had been marked with a special mark and Thomas said found it ahead of time and swapped it with another man, The Cult had pulled that man aside and beaten the life out of him before they killed him. When they found out he didn't have the money they were looking for, the cult proceeded to pull all the new people aside and go through all of their belongings and harassed them trying to find who was there looking for their sister. In the meantime Thomas's sister had been treated horribly, the children in town were allowed to torture her, poking at her with sticks, she was dragged through town in a bag it hung up inside a cabin where this religious cult gets their deity and I don't want to go any farther with that and give away any spoilers. Thomas vows to find his sister and actually make some friends and allies among the younger people along the way, this is a story of pure true love for family that believes in you, and never wanting to see someone you love suffer!Positives would be the cinematography is gorgeous! The island is just amazing! It looks like something right out of a dream of Ireland or Scotland! Something Untouched by man! The actors were very believable, I think they had a wonderful cast so the casting director should be applauded and the cast themselves should be applauded because you can tell they threw themselves into their roles! The script for the most part was incredible, you know it could have get on two different ways, you've got the whole getting someone out of a cult which we've seen a bunch of different times in more Modern Times And they took it back to a hundred years ago almost which was kind of refreshing and different, you've got a brother sister relationship which could have been more argumentative like most brother sister relationships but they took it that when the brother was off fighting in the war this is Sister would write him all the time and keep him positive when everyone else around him was faltering she was his Saving Grace and when she was locked up with this cult she always thought of her brother and he was her Saving Grace so that was totally refreshing to have such a pure love! You've got the typical everyone in the city is after one person kind of thing but they added in a bunch of subplots going on which I'm not going to touch on because I don't want to get into spoilers but the subplots in and of themselves we're very refreshing and different so that was great! Again that kind of goes back to the writers!For negatives, the only thing really I have is that it was so dark for a lot of this that I had to finish the movie during the day and it was so dark that it was hard to make out some of it. And there was so much negativity at a certain point that I don't want to bring up too much because I don't want to spoil anything that it left me feeling so bereft that it was kind of like I'm not sure if I even want to finish this!

70,Come-and-Review,"Very gory, but has more to it than that",7,13 October 2018,"Apostle is excruciating to watch, mainly due to the extreme and extensive graphic gore it contains, an element that usually would rank it as a typical gore/horror film, but it is too well-crafted to be put in a category tipically destined for 'B-movies'.In a way, it felt a bit like a modern Greek Tragedy: the succession of events leads to utter destruction, as was custom among the greek tragic plays. I highly doubt that Evans willingly wrote purposely a plot that can draw such parallelisms though.I haven't seen Evans' The Raid, but judging by this film I can see that he knows how to make a film with balanced amount of pacing, action, character development, plot and with a great use of photography. Apostle isn't an intellectual film, but it isn't a simple pop-corn horror either. I particularly loved photography: there were numerous stunning camera angles, shots and sequences throughout the film.What I very much enjoyed was character development: most of the characters didn't feel one-dimensional to me. The plot had a psychological side to it, albeit limited in proportions, which I appreciated. The main theme was also very intriguing. Mysticism, the hint at the millennias-ancient primitive pagan cult of the goddess, the way religious bigotry is displayed all felt very interesting.While it doesn't exactly have monsters or ghosts or tipical horror elements (except for gore), Apostle still has the presence of the supernatural, even if in a limited form. I would have greatly preferred the film to be devoid of unrealistic aspects, and this is what (aside from the gore) prevented me from giving the film a higher mark.7.8/10",Apostle

74,Tehmeh,"The further it goes, the emptier it gets.",5,13 January 2019,"""Apostle"", on the surface, is a good movie. Technically well-made, cinematography is good, actors are very good, it's atmospheric and very thematic and seems quite driven.That's until it starts to resemble a pile of loose ideas and themes, and the last 30-40 minutes feel like someone was trying to make it all come together, while losing the plot.Dan Stevens has charisma. Give the man more roles! He can carry a scene without effort. Most of the actors here do a really good job, and I thank them, because their talent, in hindsight, masked a lot of meaningless filler. That filler was almost always atmospheric, exciting and sometimes grotesque and haunting - and by itself deserves recognition, but when I think of the scenes as vital part of the story and movie, I can't help but feel that most of the movie was empty, cynically dressing itself to look like it wasn't. Ultimately, I thought most of the characters were wasted as well. That makes me dislike this movie more, because it's pretentious. It doesn't have a beating heart, it really doesn't even have anything to say, if we don't count it as some kind of nihilistic commentary, and even that is ruined when one of the main characters has to explain some of the themes and plot with a few forced lines at the end, just in case someone didn't get it. Yes, I get what the movie pretended it was about. It didn't hit home, it didn't land, and no, I'm not going to watch Transformers after this.This movie, to me, is the same thing as ""Altered Carbon"" the series, only more subtle at times, with better acting and better individual understanding of a scene. They both represent something I've come to loathe.I won't go as far as to say that this film is only torture/misery porn, even if it often is, there is something about it. It's not all lost, it's not all ruined, and if you're the sort of person who cares more about moods and wandering thoughts than an impactful, meaningful story, there's a good chance you will like this one. It isn't popcorn horror, there are no jumpscares, and it can be unsettling. To me, that wasn't enough. I almost feel like movies like these are trying so hard to be different to certain kinds of mainstream movies that they become prisoners of their own ambition, and forget about the core when they're too busy with appearance. Cinematic craftsmanship and surface-level quality can't always hide it.It's not bad, in many ways it's good and technically quite sound, but I ended up with nothing, Give me a movie with a heart, give me a movie that's composed of vital organs. Don't give me surface, don't give me this. No amount of torture, misery and horror isn't enough to mask all this emptiness. (The cast was awesome though!)",Apostle

82,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,The directors do not know how to make a horror film,3,30 July 2020,"What started off so strongly, trailed off into a horror-type parody, as though the entire production team couldn't decide where this film wanted to go or what it wanted to be.If you want to see a film that slowly takes you down a path of bizarre out-of-control events, watch Midsommar, not this. Not that Midsommar is a classic, just that this got progressively worse instead of gradually better.Totally clueless directing. You can't turn a slow-paced film of intrigue into a fast-paced horror unless you have excellent production skills, and even then, do it subtly so that far-fetched still seems plausible. Remember that your viewing audience only has its eyes and ears to help them, so it's no good gradually turning the screw until they are shaking their head at multiple missteps piling on, one on top of the other.A film that went totally over the top when it didn't need to and I couldn't take it seriously after a while, which was a shame because it did have potential.",Apostle

It's a creepy premise with an 1800s man arriving to a secluded island where a cult is operating in order to save his sister. It started strong with creepy atmosphere and a great location. Cool production design elements and costuming. But it never quite grabbed me. Pacing was a little slow and the character development was lacking. If it hadn't starred Dan Stevens, I might have turned it off altogether. And while I like Dan Stevens, his performance felt uneven at times, almost like his character's motivation and personality changed on a whim. I never quite felt like I got to know him even though the movie runs over 2 hours. It's not really a horror film. It's more of an eerie drama with a supernatural element.

The story starts out somewhat slow for the first 40 min in its development of the overall setting and intent of the characters with great atmosphere and landscape visuals that set the initial tone. As the story starts unraveling, this film goes into some very unexpected territory with some intensely creepy aspects, and relentless mayhem unleashed. The finale wraps it up in supreme fashion, and the build up is definitely paid off in the end. Dan Stevens and the cast are all very passionate in their performances and the film seeps with authenticity because of it. The real standout are the immaculate visuals that capture some amazingly vicious moments in such brilliant manner. There are so many incredible shots throughout, and director Gareth Evans does not hold back on what he wants to portray on screen. The set design was also so realistic and immersive.

Instead of masking the horror underneath, they present a grim, barren and foreboding face to the world. The pacing, urgency and action were uneven, at times bordering on comical and absurd.

It had crazy people in it, a drill machine to put holes in the head for cleansing with a flower petal put in the hole the drill made. It reminded me of the vvitch film a little.

Fans of the genre will probably adore this movie.With that said, I personally didn't enjoy the extreme and voyeuristic violence, especially since Evans favours torture scenes almost entirely over well choreographed fight scenes (something that he's good at and that I expected going in). Particularly in comparison to his THE RAID movies APOSTLE just falls disappointingly short. The film pretending to be deep with its supernatural themes and the long runtime also didn't play in its favour.As for minor complaints, the film didn't feel like it was set in 1905. It felt either too archaic for taking place on a British island at that time, even given the rural setting, or too modern, especially when it came to some character interactions.In the end, I would have preferred to see a similar story set f. e. in a small colonial village in 17th century America without the supernatural bullshit.

Then, there's a half-baked love story tacked on too.I suppose the movie's got good production values. Still, the script is a mess, full of implausible coincidences and a lotta melodrama, which strikes me as pretty out of place in a would-be splatter flick.

However, the script and overall story wasn't excellent.The acting wasn't too bad; Martin Sheen was pretty good as always. Dan Stevens turned in a pretty solid performance. A good film to compare it to is the Ritual. This was better than that. Both deal with a culture built around keeping an ancient and ancestral god from ending their way of life. This film was better than that. BUT it still wasn't great.One of the things that it did well was not actually try to be a horror movie. Though it's billed as one, it doesn't actually try to be scary. Rather it attempts a foreboding atmosphere. There's a certain dread.What it does poorly is deliver on something to fear. Our main character has a motivation and so do the antagonists, but there's no actual object of fear. The goddess isn't actually that scary, and the human antagonism is somewhat lacking.It's not bad, just not very good.",Apostle

I'm sure the idea and the plot were all good and accurate but it just wasn't that entertaining as an horror film.For starters the horror aspect of the film didnt really get going until an hour into the film. There is no argument about that, no matter the build up it was boring for the first hour. Then like snapping your fingers it turned into a gore / horror fest. Unfortunately by that point I'd lost interest in the film. It kind of didn't really know what it was, this film could have easily been a thriller until the hour mark.I could go on to analyse the rest of this film but I feel it there is no point. It seems to me that the reveiws are split from one end of the spectrum to the other.However do realise that this film even if you enjoy it is not a 9 /10 rated film and if you are rating it at that, stop because your a fool.

An allegorical and metaphorical film for all that is right and wrong with organized religion from conception to destruction this film holds a mirror to humanity and its inherent greed and corruption of that which is at its base beautiful.Intriguingly dark and beautiful at once with subtle visual effects and sweeping cinematography intertwined with moments of sheer disbelief and awe. This film is not for everyone, but those who find religious ideology, cultism, and the corruption of innocence of interest I would highly recommend this film.",Apostle
120,cinemawithcj,Apostle - Cinema with CJ Review,10,1 December 2018,"Apostle is too good to just be on streaming. The latest release from director Gareth Evans - known mostly for the two brilliant The Raid films - Apostle follows a man's journey to infiltrate a religious cult that has her sister captive and turns into a gloriously bloody and dark period horror.Cults are scary, man. Whether it's The Wicker Man or even Evans' own previous work in V/H/S 2, cults are sinister, mysterious, and effortlessly creepy.Good horror comes out of mystery, and Apostle delivers. It subverts a slow burn through Evans' economic storytelling, instead giving us drip-fed intrigue that never lulls and always propels.Apostle is fantastically cast. And if anyone can surpass the lead played by the great Dan Stevens, it's Michael Sheen, who plays the leader of the cult that's a glorious villain. It's known that the best villains are the hero in their story, and this is exactly that. Sheen needs to provide for his flock, even if that means torture and sacrifice. But it's not a sin for this community, it's necessary for the growth of the land they live on. Which is what makes it all the more sinister.The economics for this film illustrates how well a film can tell a story and how most films seem to fail. Exposition is never a chore here, and if we need a dialogue dump, we are transported the way the words try to, and that's brilliant, because films are not plays. It's the more visual medium.A medium where Evans shines. Even though there's not constant action through Apostle, the energy and movement of his previous movies lives in this film's DNA. Every shot is calculated. The camera twists and turns exactly when it needs to. It chooses shots for meaning, not for cool. We are distorted and thrown into the POV of characters where it really matters. Everything informs everything in the construction of this film and that's why it works so well.Apostle fills you with intrigue and gives you enough movie logic for you to buy what's happening. As it goes on, you continue to accept the paths these characters take and their motivations and the events that unfold. But then again, the film posits the question. Should you?Should you believe?",Apostle

Very tense, but confused as to what it is really trying to say..",6,27 October 2018,"I don't mind violence or gore in films particularly but I like there to be a coherent point to it. It shouldn't be there gratuitously, but to act as an essential part of the story. The story also has to be interesting as well to justify the use of such violence. Make no mistake this is a very violent film. It is well made, but I'm unconvinced that the story is a solid enough one to jusitfy this level of violence.When I talk of violence: there is disembowelling,.trepanning turned up to eleven, a pulversing human sized, mincing machine, neck slitting scenes, religious cross branding. Therefore a veritable generation game conveyor belt of horror tropes, new and old.This story is really the Wickerman on an excursion to the slaughterhouse. It's themes are really about pagan worship, usurping no thrills barred christian worship. Yet the violence means what could have a dark but satisfying tale, becomes a brutalist blood fest. It doesn't allow a lot of room for subtle acting, but Michael Sheen does very good work as the leader/prophet, and is compelling. Dan Stevens (okayishly) plays the obstensiable hero of the piece sent to rescue a kidnapped girl from the cult that Michael Sheen leads. Things are complicated by sub-plots involving a love story between two teenagers which you probably suspect, correctly as it turns out, won't turn out well.There also turns out to be a battle for leadership of the cult by Msrk Lewis Jones who plays Quinn. Quinn is a brutal person badly in need of anger management and an HR chat.I think the film is well made. It is tense, but it uses non-to subtle points about paganism as an excuse to justify the level of violence. If you want a straight out gory film this will do it for you. If you want a film that makes its arguments with a degree of sophistication this is not the film for you. Yep youy've been warned.",Apostle
128,MovieNinjaGuy,Awful disgrace,1,1 January 2019,"I actually liked Gareth Evans' Raid movies but this is just bad.Here we have a bizarre horror plot with crazy new ideas added at every turn and no sense of direction or where we will end up. Torture scenes are added for the sake of it rather than important to the plot. Innocent people getting tortured, animals getting their necks slit and this is all graphically executed. There are better uses for that type of movie budget in my opinion.Awful that Netflix sponsors this graphic garbage, let alone places it on their main watch list pages so blatantly whilst I had to look really hard to find just added theatrical movies such as Bruce Willis' Death Wish (which is actually not bad and far less gruesome than this carry on).If you like gore and seeing weird serious torture nonsense by all means watch it.
If you have a conscious and empathy for humans and animals you will probably hate this.Me, I'm probably cancelling Netflix after this disgrace.
A lot of their own stuff is often crap but this just pushed me over the edge.

He knows how to craft a good suspenseful action scene and he does it well in Apostle. Only difference here is it's a period piece horror/ thriller and a slow burn at that. You have to be patient with this one, but come the second half of the movie the thrills and violence start to show up and so does your adrenaline. I like Dan Stevens as the main character, sent out to find his sister who is involved with a sinister religious commune. He seems quite as bitter as the drops of laudanum he takes daily to suppress his pain or purely his addiction. If you enjoyed the Raid 1 and 2 you will most likely enjoy this. You can see hints of those movies in the way Gareth filmed some of the fight scenes. Give Apostle a go if you are in the mood for slow burn, intense horror. 7.5/10",Apostle

Because I find it too long that induced a sense of boredom and while you're at it, you'd always check the clock and wonder if it's about to end. There were lots of unnecessary scenes that contributed to it being sooo long... It wasn't as predictable yes but, it's quite confusing that you'd only somehow piece the puzzles together during it's last 40 mins or so.Would I recommend it?

135,aji_gps,Different Taste but Same Magnitude,10,30 May 2020,"Gareth Evans moved taste from The Raid gangster movie to the pagan horror movie, Apostle. Do I, as a true lover of The Raid 2, feel betrayed? No. Because I'm a pagan horror lover too. I just watched Midsommar and from there I started my pagan horror adventure. As a result I watched the original wicker man and was very impressed.Midsommar is very satisfying but if you feel ""defeated"" in the film, then Apostle, on the contrary, will reciprocate that feeling. In terms of its homage to Wicker Man, this film is like giving a different perspective to the film. This film feels like the ""what if"" version of Wicker Man.Dan Stevens might be the new ""Iko Uwais"" for Gareth Evans, and if Iko Uwais is very good at being a hero by stating, this can't be done by Dan Stevens in the same way. So Gareth Evans is very clever to give us the same bloody film but wrapped in horror, not crime.The funny thing is, what Gareth Evans has done is arguably the opposite of his director friend, Timo Tjahjanto. If Gareth Evans moves from Crime to Horror, Timo who was famous for his bloody horror, Macaber, now handles Crime films like ""The Night Comes For Us"" very well.As I am a supportive fan for Iko Uwais, I also follow Dan Stevens from his films such as The Guest, the Legion series, Beauty and The Beast, and Colossal. Dan Stevens always shows a different character in every film and he carries it well. In this film he also shows his versatility by giving a character that he had never shown before.Bravo for Pagan Horror, violent films, Apostle, Gareth Evans, and Dan Stevens.",Apostle

137,srutimisra,Must watch,9,22 July 2021,"""Apostle"" is a period horror mystery film which was first premiered at Fantastic Fest in 2018. Dan Stevens is in the lead role. The plot is about a religious cult. There's a remote island which was used to be fertile, now converts into a barren land. It will become fertile again through blood sacrifice. The protagonist's sister was kidnapped and held for ransom. He went to the island to rescue his sister and the story goes on.First of all, the most attractive part in this film is cinematography. It's really outstanding. The movie is more of a slow burn horror. There are lots of bloodsheds and gory scenes in this movie. Screenplay is amazing. It will keep you hooked till the very end. Well, there is no ghost, there are no jumpscares. The story is the only horror element here. People who love to watch different kind of horror movies, I think this is the film you shouldn't miss at all.""Apostle"" is a must watch.

The cinematography, set and costume designs, the visuals - this film looks great. The location and environment of the film are also very impressive. The designs of certain supernatural locations and beings are also great. There are a lot of cool concepts present.The first 20-30 minutes of the film is quite boring compared to the latter, but it is still watchable and engaging.The performances in the movie are very strong, especially Dan Stevens. None of the actors did a bad job IMO.The film is also very violent, some of the scenes were kinda hard to watch almost. But when the main characters take down the bad guy in a brutal way, you root for the heroes - it is the best kill in the movie.Overall, it is a story of a man's journey of finding his belief again + fall of a very sinister and mysterious religious community.

Yes, if you're expecting the in media res of The Raid you're probably in for a disappointment, as this is a bit of a slower burn. There are some pretty intensely violent moments but they are in the minority. No, it is not a perfect movie, but I think it successfully segues from period piece to horror film pretty well. Some people will probably have a problem with the fact that it isn't enough of one or the other. It's a difficult film to classify and there are some narrative holes. But I think it has enough interesting elements, stand-out scenes, and general intrigue to warrant a 7/10.",Apostle

146,Chancery_Stone,Dire,3,9 November 2018,"Overly long, feels like it runs for 4 hours, although it's only 2, and sadly lacking in a plot - or point. It looks great, grimy and 'authentic', but authentically what? It felt like it didn't know what period it was, or even what country it was in. Western frontier houses in what looked like Wales, with WW1 costumes with what looked like Regency guns. But worse than all of this was Dan Stevens lead character. I don't know what the had been told to emote, but all we got was 'addict-having breakdown' combined with what was supposed to be, I assume, 'distraught black sheep desperate to find girl'. Instead he just looked cross and pouty all the time, constantly gurning and giving sidelong glances. He was meant to be 'hidden' but spent so much time looking shifty and furtive he more or less had a sign above him. Then there was the 'earth spirit', for want of a better word for her. She was evil - or maybe not. She didn't want to eat, yet sucked down blood like she was starving. She was tied up but spent all the time somehow wandering about the woods, taking strolls or just popping up randomly. And the leaders were religious, or maybe not. Maybe communists, or radicals, or maybe just a branch of the Rotarians. Who knows - they certainly didn't.Muddled, sullen, unentertaining and incoherent. Not surreal or weird, just incoherent. Dreadful.",Apostle
147,damienmassart,A B-movie with Netflix's means,5,11 November 2018,"Sure, Apostle could have been a great movie : an interesting plot, good actors, and a great director. Unfortunarely, good ingredients do not always make a good recipe, and in this case the result is anything but good.
The scenario is diluted in a staging certainly elegant and stylish, but sorely lacking rhythm. It's long, way too long, even when you like, as I do, movies that favor atmosphere to action. And when finally the narrative mechanics accelerates, the movie becomes incoherent, even grotesque. So, Apostle tries to become horrific but the film fails once again to reach its goal despite a plethora of so-called terrifying scenes. By the way, I'm surprised that some users compare this film to a masterpiece like The Wicker Man. Let's say it frankly: Apostle has nothing to do with Robin Hatdy's classic. No, it's just a poor B-movie spiked by Netflix's financial means.",Apostle

I really disliked Dan Stevens in the meh-fest that was Beauty and the Beast but I thought he did a really good job here, his mannerisms, movement and speech all like a distinct character, not like a star putting in an appearance. The supporting actors were all very good and Michael Sheen is always great. But the twisted story with it's hints of Wicker Man (and not the embarrassing remake, but the good one) is what grabs you.

150,Penroze,The Grinder has stolen my heart,8,8 July 2021,"As someone who isn't normally a fan of religious horror, this movie was very satisfying and had me invested at every turn! While the premise of 'travelling to a secluded and primitive mini-society of people who operate in ways considered immoral by the majority of humanity' is done a fair bit (surprisingly), this movie offers its own unique take with its own mythology. The cast of characters is very engaging, in both acting and writing, and it's shocking to see what happens to some of them. I might have cried at one point? I'm actually not sure, but it felt like it. Of course, being a horror movie, it also offered some nice scares, mostly through the crazed cult members as usual but sometimes through some fairly stranger characters. The Grinder is an example of the latter. I have no idea who they were as it was never explained, and I won't spoil them by going into detail, but they were always so uncomfortable to see on screen (in a good way), and the unsolved mystery surrounding them helped greatly. If for nothing else, watch Apostle for The Grinder. They're so weird.",Apostle

This may seem an exaggeration, but it is not. The creators seem to think that to see gore on the screen is all the public wants by way of entertainment, and the screenplay (it seems almost absurd to dignify the writing n this film with the name) veers all over the place, regardless of sense, characterisation or narrative, just to provide instances of blood-spattered violence.

That ALONE should have ended the movie in the first -ohh, twenty minutes or so.As to the rest, not a heck of a lot of it made sense. The ""Goddess"" wanted to be set afire and killed? She SMILED as she burned to death??Then at the end, the protagonist dies bleeding cheerfully (FINALLY showing an emotion as he smiles, dying) and his blood feeds the ground, plants begin growing around him all healthy and happy as though he's now the ""god"" of the island???Who authorized the release of this garbage? The High School teacher who demanded that it be written by his children? I'm frankly embarrassed that I sat through the entire thing, but I was having a VERY slow morning and it's available on my Netflix account.I gave it two stars for the gore. I like gore.

165,Vinicius8,"""As the moon becomes the night time""",7,12 November 2018,"My dearest father...
""Apostle"" opens up with Thomas' kidnapped sister's letter to their father, pleading for rescue. The kidnappers: a creepy cult. What they want? Ransom money. Wasting no further time with explanations, alongside Thomas, we are thrown in a quick journey to the island where the cult is situated. Away from
the heinous dominant civilization. Things quickly take a turn for the creepy (and not the worst, for now) when we learn of the devout's behavior. But it is too late to turn back. And Thomas has a mission to complete.I'd say the movie is divided in 2 parts: the build-up and the resolution.
The first part tries its best to create some sort of sympathy for characters, but fails miserably, for writing is not ours dearest Mr. Evans strongest suit. He should really just stick to directing. He's freaking good at that.
Every single dialogue is terrible in this movie. It's not even that it feels... out of place, it is straight up a mess. It's incoherent, cliché, soulless and unnecessary. Lucky for us, there isn't a whole lot of dialogue. It really kills the story, because it impedes us from connecting with the characters, and them with each other.
One bad guy is made to look good, and the other simply turns sadistic at random. Considering the ""gadgets"" the religious community had in store, I wonder why the hell the cult leader morally wavered at a certain point.
The actors are great, but they have terrible lines. And they try. I mean, they have so much more to offer, and so does the director. It's a shame they didn't give the script to someone more knowledgeable in writing.When the climax kicks in, all the mechanisms used to push this latter part of the movie forward weren't explored in the first segment. For that reason, the shift in tone feels drastic, also failing in sticking together beginning and ending. However, because the second segment unravels predictably, it maintains a good balance on both sides, succeeding in not losing the viewer midway through. It also helps that the film has a great atmosphere, thanks to the sets, costume design, make up and photography.In short, the slow burning build up doesn't work. We don't get attached to the characters. But then the real horror starts. That's when the movie shines. In a mix of Outlast and conventional horror, ""Apostle"" delivers in a wildly violent and tense fashion everything we were hoping for. It does surprise a bit in how it goes about in doing so, but it's mostly a standard horror movie, beautifully gory.",Apostle

All is there, but those elements are ruined by the lack of a coherent theme or story and insufficient character development, leaving us with a film that fails to live up to its premises.The story's setup is pretty thin and confusing, a sensation that carries on through the whole movie. Character motivation is not properly established or explored often, and, while the acting is fairly good (save for the lead actor in the beginning, who acts all suspicious and like he's hung for some reason) the uncoherent and sometimes unexplained actions of the characters ruin all credibility. Plot and coherence progressively fade away as the movie goes on, and by the end all there is leave is deeply unsatisfactory symbolism that isn't properly explored and a very anticlimactic ending. Tension and thrills are mainly absent due to the very thin thread that carries on the plot. I am giving the movie 5 stars because of the positive aspects liste above, but the ending result is sorely lacking, a sad shadow of what it could have been. Disappointing, overall.",Apostle

Tension is not allowed to build up, pointless story aspects are shoehorned in, and none of the characters are developed. This could have been shown entirely through the eyes of the protagonist, a stranger to the island; or it could have been about the fortunes of the cult's leader. But there are no well-defined characters, and there is hardly a storyline to speak of.I watched the trailer and the imagery looked brilliant.

It starts with pretty typical, Wicker Man creepy isolated island stuff but switches into some gory horror goodness. The lead performances are excellent. The score, based primarily on found percussion and screeching strings, is brilliant. While some of the reviews are right, the plot does lose a little coherence towards the end. But the journey there is an incredible example of tension building and the way the ending plays out is cathartic and rewarding, even if it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. This movie is very much in line with things like The VVitch and Hold the Dark - if you liked those, I have no doubt that you'll like this. If you hated those, probably skip this one. And if you can't handle blood and gore, for creepy-nature/plant-blood drinking goddess' sake do not drop the rating because there's some scenes of violence (and as a gorehound I can tell you that the violence on display here is great. Would've liked more). It is not unnecessary or gratuitous. It is a device used very well to disturb the viewer. Horror probably isn't the genre for you if you don't like that. But it should be noted that this is also a very mean film - don't expect happiness. And if you're thinking ""they can't really go there, that's so bleak"", well, they do. If you're a religious nut you probably shouldn't watch this either unless you wanna get angry and write a scathing review online about how it's blasphemous and offends you.

Go with the flow and it'll take you to the edge of that seat many times. Quick check of storyline blurb ""oh, guy goes after his missing daughter in 1910 (or so) that joined a cult"" will NOT do justice. I still don't know for sure what I just saw but don't care; good ride! For those liking this genre and mostly knowing what you're getting, then it's HIGHLY recommended. Frankly too bizarre to pass up no matter what your tastes. Helps with outstanding cast and top-notch production values throughout.Can't help think too much on THIS unique... um, gem I guess. These won't spoil the fun buuuuut:Some Questions & Observations.
Hero sneaks onto the remote island cult village with group of new recruits. Not too bad a place (for 1910 farming village). Modest attempt at a ""utopia"" without government meddling. Even gotta like the intense leader. So WTF with all the rest? Namely (in no order; no notes till last half):#1: Why the Dark Ages punishments for transgressions? That just a necessary part of the cult thing? Nobody would risk it, esp with a justice system that seemed to consist of simply pointing your finger.#2: Speaking of, with the expressed difficulty getting to the location, impossibility (for some reason) of mainland resupply and all that frontier logistic nightmares, WHY waste cargo space hauling in several large items from the ACME Heavy Metal (TM) torture catalog? (Admittedly the head vice/drill combo was clearly DYI yet what lunatic used key tools for THAT?)#3: Miss Miracle Grow of 1910: um, ah... what... who was that now? Witch of some kind? Part of a really bad invasive tree root infestation nourished through her drinking of human blood? Where's that biology text? Oh, forget it. But they just find her there? And ""worshipping"" here is beneficial in what way exactly?#4: Barechested care worker with head wrapped in mummy cords. Nice beehive. Breath okay in there? Show up for the job interview in THAT getup? Just wander over to the cafe for meals? ""Well, break time over. Gotta get over for Miss Grow's four o'clock feeding. Glad that wasn't in the brochure as a lot comes from recruits!"" Anybody notice your style?#5: All security goons need matching black dusters.#6: No real excuse needed for 90% of civil townsfolk to simulataneously flip lids.#7: Easy group suicide? Levitate 80 feet up 100-foot tall trees and impale selves on thick branches somehow retaining smaller branches that would have broken off if... sigh. Good shot, of course.

180,dsruss-770-941629,"Moody, Beautiful Gothic Horror",8,16 October 2018,"First off, if you are expecting an action movie, something even remotely close to Edwards' other two films The Raid and The Raid 2, this isn't the movie for you. It is slow, methodically paced, and with about 5 mins of pure action in the entirety of its 130m run time. This is a beautifully written, acted and shot gothic body horror period piece. It is a little overstuffed with genres, but that's ok. It makes up for it with dread and just pure nastiness. Its not an action film but it has brutal violence to spare. Thankfully, the character back-stories aren't expositioned to death. The ""mythology"" of the island isn't either. Its about 20 mins too long and some of the pieces of the puzzle don't fit together all the way, minor plot holes. Again, it didn't bother me. Edwards has, hopefully, a very long career before him and based on the strength of the Raid movies and Apostle, he should be entering the upper echelons of cinema auteur any year now. And he needs to stay out of the Hollywood system. This would've been focus grouped into an incoherent mess. If you liked The VVitch and the original Wicker Man, this is the love child of those films.",Apostle
181,msoysta,Beautifully filmed- absolutely ridiculous,3,25 October 2020,"A film that masquerades as art, which by some of the alleged highbrow reviews here fooled a few, with an insipid storyline.
It starts out ok, if you think anyone who cares about rescuing their loved one would send an addicted drifter with filthy fingernails on the mission. I couldn't get past his inability to wash his hand if embarking on such a journey.
The violence throughout was graphically disgusting I guess for shock value? Hmmm unnecessary. And questions still linger like wtf was that creature & why? No real history given. Granted, it could have been an interesting concept if some of the blanks were filled in.
In the end, it was barely watchable with your typical horror concept of no one ever dying despite experiencing 42 lethal actions, and a lack of closure in many ways. This film reminds me of a beautiful woman who is dumb as a rock. All looks no substance.",Apostle
182,thomasheaney,Surprisingly good...,7,29 June 2020,"I made the mistake of reading some of the reviews before watching the film and went into it not expecting much, but ended up really enjoying it.
The first half is quite slow, but keeps you intrigued with beautifully shot scenes and an unraveling mystery. Going into the final hour the intensity and violence is significantly ramped up, leaving you scared for some of the characters and seriously wanting others dead.
The acting is pretty good with Michael Sheen putting in a great performance, but found Dan Stevens character rather annoying whether he was intended to come across like that or not.
The story whilst starting out reasonably grounded does become less so as you get closer to the end, but I enjoyed where it went and there were themes and scenarios that I didn't see coming.
If you were to mix the original Wicker Man with Midsommar, Apostle is what you would get. An enjoyable film that still has a few flaws, but never the less is definitely worth the watch.",Apostle
183,dlinderman-55448,What was this trying to do?,1,1 November 2018,I don't understand the high reviews. This seemingly endless film full of too many unimportant plot points was so uninteresting I can't fathom how I got through the entire thing. Did this film know what it wanted to be? Never once did I find myself caring one way or another about the characters. The original point of the guy going to retrieve his sister was a practically pointless plot point for the sake of giving him a reason to go to this island of dumbassery. Characters you think might have some relative importance just die for no real reason. It just never made sense. It felt like half a dozen ideas pushed into a film that never ran with any of them in a meaningful way.,Apostle

It is no different than sex porn movies, who have extremely thin, implausible story lines just to give occasion for the main feature that they know you want. some reviewers mentioned the moral of the story is that ""man destroys religion"", but I saw that also one of the most important agendas of satanists was there, which is to discourage people from following God at all.",Apostle

We weren't expecting the reveal certainly, but not quite 10 worthy. I loved the scene and the acting. I didn't understand the end but that maybe is the good thing about it, makes you want to go figure it out after. Personally I would have liked the ending explained better.

Sure the scare factor isn't on the terrifying level, but it does give off the creepy cult vibe a lot throughout the entire film which can substitute.

The story is stupid and changes abruptly with no justification for the viewer. The director used the stupidest ways to make things work for the hero meanwhile you sit and wonder. An example is when the good guy is in tunnel and the enemy waiting for him at the end. The enemy sees the light coming up the exit, yet he waits. When the good guy is alerted and leaves and one of the gangster comes with a light the enemy opens fire, gotta give credit though that no one was hurt during that. The same case goes on and on. A guy sees his son dead by the hand of his colleague. He gets mad and !! He leaves to kill a monster?? The hero who was on the run sees a boy being captured by 4 gangster. Instead of interfering there or leave it be. He returns to the village and become captured, a boy murdered brutally and slowly yet he doesn't scream or cry or react. He simply lay there....And there is loads of these cases that make me think. Is this a college project that was done at the last day by amateurs?

224,seiteom,"I mourn a great idea, directed to smithereens",3,27 October 2018,"When watching Apostle, I get the same feeling as with some other bad movies in recent years. A lot is just right; there are really interesting and good ideas in the material, and most actors are okay, music quite good, and the visuals are great. But the direction and editing of the film just kills it.
I think this is the basic incorrect assumption that moves the director in this case: the audience will totally buy anything that happens if it fits within the stereotypical narrative I signal at the start of the movie. A cultish and isolated community = brave but haunted individualists fight against weak but cynical communitarians that always become too dogmatic for their own good. If the film narrative is kept within those parameters, the audiences will totally buy everything.
But that assumption is wrong. We, the audience, are capable of noticing when characters act out of character (happens a lot here), when people suddenly seem to have dressed up in black sacrifice clothes in seconds, or people change their opinions of each other between two scenes.
Lesson learned: don't adapt everything to a stupid, stereotypical narrative. Instead, adapt the narrative to great ideas and interesting characters. I know it's hard, but that's what they pay you for!
Anyway, I mourn the really interesting idea at the bottom of this train wreck of a film, as well as the great photography.",Apostle

I might be wrong, but that's how it feels. Tonally it's all over the place too, with one foot in fantasy melodrama and another in a more grounded, human, psychological horror thriller. Dan Stevens' performance in the lead relies too often on heavy duty scowling, Michael Sheen is convincing as the despotic cult leader, Lucy Boynon lights up the screen and gives the film some heart. Oh, and there's too many endings. Ultimately I didn't care enough who lived and who died. A shame really, as it has its merits: nicely shot, some good acting, good visuals at times (when it steers clear of the 'magical' nature goddess stuff) and some disturbing (though sometimes gratuitously violent) set pieces.

The main protagonist acting is off putting. Looking like a crazed asylum escapee at times, scowling for no reason at times, and general misguided acting.
There are scenes that make no logical sense other than to demonstrate the wickedness without reason. Why is the marked ticket holder murdered when they knew he wasn't their guy?
Why don't victims voice their response to false accusations when dire consequences are the possible outcome?

252,davidbdr-1,Ignore the clueless reviewers,8,15 October 2018,"Before I even get into the laughable complaints made by the clueless, I must write that this is the first film in a very long time that I found compelling and didn't notice the ""long running time."" Some films deserve to take their time to reveal the story. If that bothers you--go watch the latest inane, super hero CGI fest that spoon feeds you your shallow entertainment.The idea that Man corrupts religion for his own ends is the main theme. It is obvious that many viewers have lost the ability to actually watch a film and grasp its concepts. They complain about ""no plot"" when it's right there on the screen. If the film is not edited with the frenetic pace of a television commercial--it is considered slow.Yes, there are thematic similarities to the original Wicker Man (not the pathetic Americanized atrocity made recently) but that is just due to the use of an isolated setting and Pagan religion and mythology. The plots are distinctly different.Someone made a comment about the use of a ""Zippo"" lighter being somehow how bad the film was. Quick research (which obviously the filmmaker did) shows that ""automatic"" lighters where available by 1889 and the particular lighter shown was available in 1905! Zippo did not invent lighters--they just refined them and mass produced them for WW2. Don't claim knowledge if you don't posses it.Another complaint was the island's village was too primitive for 1905? Really, Hand-hewn buildings look just like this. Again, every idiot who can thumb type thinks they know better than the filmmaker.This is not a review of the film but more a review of the proliferation of useless, pointless ""opinion"" blurbs that people believe are reviews. A review is also not just a recounting of the plot. Just typing ""this movie was a waste of time"" is not relevant to anyone but the typist.If a film about man's corruption of religion and an creepy use of Celtic/Earth mythology acting as the metaphor and some gruesome violence thrown in doesn't hold your interest maybe Transformers would suit you better.",Apostle

Minutes later the excessive gore started (it's not that there was so much gore, but that there was no need for so much gore given the plot and atmosphere).

In fact its one of those movies that seem to linger in the back of my mind.I wont go into detail here, as everything I'd say would potentially spoil the experience, but in my opinion the movie has very few clichés. I usually am able to predict large parts of the plot in movies. Not so much here. I also like the fact that the director, despite having ample opportunities of exploitation through grisly detailed violence, chooses to spare the viewer from the worst parts. I mean, whats the point? We already know whats happening.Lastly, I find the running length a strength, not a weakness. I never was bored throughout the whole thing, and found it interesting to get to know the characters better than usually. In fact I mostly watch series these days because of this.Anyways, 9 out of 10 from me.

Also do not go in expecting 'The Raid' in a historical setting; this is a different movie and should be treated as suchThis is a terrific movie with outstanding performances (Dan Stevens) and outstanding direction and cinematography.The cinematography is to be lauded in many of the action sequences. When i say 'action' sequences, they are not the well choreographed, Pencak Silat fights, but more of the realistic brawls with extremely inventive camera-work and masterful editing.As said before, it really isn't much of a horror film.

Brutal cult horror starring Dan Stevens and Lucy Boynton? What's not to like? Well, the story for starters is remarkably poor-paced. We begin with an eerie, slow burn feel, but after the two male leads break into the home of the three leaders, the story begins moving at a very fast and rushed speed. The villain also leaves a lot to be desired. He's evil and cruel, but the buildup felt forced and insultingly hamhanded. Other than these unfortunate truths, the movie is great. It's phenomemally well-shot, and the idea of a deity held as a slave for prosper is frankly brilliant. I just wish the script had undergone a few more revisions before leaving the writers' room.

It's a mystery-religious film with ""horror"" as a subgenre. It has so many references on religious subjects, that are on point. This is the base of this film. At the start it seems like ""the village"", which is not by any means bad. Then, we have the metaphysic factor, which is ok. But the relegious subjects: we have Thomas (you know, the bible), who doesn't believe in anything, even Christ as we see in the film. In the end though, Thomas's faith is restored and helps rebuild the island (thus the apostle title). This is a very good film with lots of references.
Maybe you will see the ""bad"" reviews. So, for everyone with a basic religious education, I say this: watch this one, it worths your time to the fullest!",Apostle

This is one of them. It's a visceral, cerebral film that will have you thinking about it long after it's finished. I might be wrong, but I found it allegorical about our destruction of the earth and Mother Nature, in a similar vein to Mother. Great cast with some fine acting and a script that doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience. It got a bit hammy at times, but in a film of this style, that doesn't matter too much. The film starts out like a period detective movie, but slowly takes a more sinister turn. Characters are allowed to develop as the film unfolds, and cleverly has you changing your mind as to who might be the good hours and bad guys. It's a complex story that will warrant a second viewing.
Definitely worth a look. The director has already proven his worth with The Raid franchise, and it's nice to see him branching out into brave, challenging horror films like this.",Apostle
279,ijamadar,Yet another anti Christian film that inverts reality in favor of satanism,1,4 November 2018,"It does not take a genius to see the inversion of religion, in this case the Christian faith, as the false God. With the very obvious thinly veiled usage of the Irish Nuns sad history being used as the justification of this. Even the statue of the so called Island deity being blatantly in the image of a Nun. And the sub plot where the boy gets the girl pregnant and then is killed by the father as its deemed blasphemy.
To the ex priest missionary who gave up on God because he did not save him in his time of need, a common excuse used by faith haters as a justification.
Should not be surprised, as it is after all Netflix, who bought us oh so wholesome and not at all satanic beauty's such as Santa Clarita Diet.
For those that enjoy this kind of trash and yes that includes you lot who try excuse or justify it behind the bull that one should simply focus on its horror and film excellence.

All that tuition my parents wasted. All for naught.
No wonder my mother didn't want to talk to me before she died; I've always been a heathen non-believer, and always will be 😈. Try cramming that 💩 down my throat and I'll become an obstinate 4 year old, sitting at the dinner table until 3 in the morning, with the plate still occupied by brussel sprouts 😇(yeah, like that guy).
No one could possibly think that religion is damaging, I used to believe. I'll never know other people could see religion for the crap it does to people. I'll never meet, speak, find..others who are left damaged, laden with an entire full cargo ship's worth of guilt shame and isolation.
This movie left me feeling like, ""hell yes, there ARE more like myself"" and it seems to be gaining momentum, this steering away from these dark ages beliefs (now with less torture!!).
Okay, enough unloading off my heavily laden heart..I gotta say this 💩 was freaky. It seems to me that Dan Stevens like a good workout DURING the filming of things. Unholy crap, what're they gonna do to him on next season of Legion; he seems to do much panting I am starting to suspect he might have asthma (im JK, lighten up ppl).
And I hate to admit this, but that scene where the kid's head gets 'aerated'...I have watched a lot of horror, movies, tv, Sandler's first movie (go ahead, see if you can find it...but I wouldn't look too hard, and I love his movies). I actually had to dash out of the room. Peeking at the screen from around a corner. Through my fingers. And I NEVER watch horror stuff THRU MY FINGERS (i consider it to be the cowardly way to watch). And only when there was no screaming.
Damn good stuff, freaking me out like that.
I'll be cuddling ALL my plushies tonight. Thanks.
BTW, this might contain spoilers...sorta. So I am marking it YES, but I'm not certain if people will understand what i meant by someones head being aerated. Unless theyve watched it, in which case its not a spoiler. And why would people read a review of something theyve not watched yet?",Apostle

So many of these movies cast white men that all look the same. This was not a problem with this movie.Second, the costuming, filmography and score was also a win for the movie. I was never bored watching it.Now, the actual plot is basically non-existent. The movie starts off strong and I was initially very interested in the main character's motivations and the worldbuilding. However, half way through the movie, any semblance of a plot that makes sense was thrown out the window.The entire second half of the movie is just the cast getting bludgeoned, stabbed, beaten and tortured to death by one another. There is almost no reason for this and it all happens very suddenly. By the end of the movie, so many people are dead and so little dialogue has happened that none of the questions from the beginning of the movie can be answered.All in all, the gore part was not very good. The characters are so non sensical that anything that happens to them doesnt feel real. Even when they're swimming in blood, there is no real gravity because nothing is ever explained and nothing makes sense.The plot started off great but was lost and never picked back up.If you watch this movie, watch it for the acting and set design.

A sit back and go with the flow sort of film although in some parts

The acting is good and cinematography too, but thats about it, you need more than that to make a movie that has almost 7 IMBD rating.

310,MetallicityBrandon,"Intense and Stylish Film, But Lacks Substance",6,11 February 2021,"Apostle is exactly my kind of horror movie, at least on paper. A period piece focusing on a hidden cult that is worshipping an actual deity. It has a cool twist on the genre, great camerawork for establishing shots and actions scenes, and decent writing.So why only a 6? Well, there's something missing behind the scenes. For one, almost none of the characters have any actual relationship with each other. They are bone-dry and this leads to a lack of tension in scenes that absolutely should be intense. Even the main driving force behind the plot, which centers around a sibling relationship, has almost no weight to it. The only relationship that had any sort of development was one that you could tell from a mile away was destined to end. It was also relegated to a pointless side plot which greatly lengthened the movie. Apostle is really only two hours, but it felt much longer by the end.The actors all do well in their roles, especially Dan Stevens and Michael Sheen. Their characters in and of themselves have a lot of interesting traits and nuances to them which were refreshing to watch. As I alluded to above, the movie is beautiful to look at. The filmmakers clearly knew how to shoot action scenes, and they gave each punch or cut a certain visual gravitas. The sets were very convincing, as were the designs of the costumes.Apostle is a great movie without much going on behind the surface. Its great to watch, but hard to get invested in. Being nearly all spectacle, it's a decent popcorn movie, but any serious fan of movies might give this a pass.",Apostle

I started out laying on my couch and found myself sitting straight up at the edge of my seat at the end. It felt like Midsommar all over again: ""Are they allowed to show this in a movie?""

313,divuar,Naive symbolism and weak plot,4,28 August 2021,"First of all, I was looking forward to watching this movie for a long time. I heard it should be enjoyable for those who love The Vvitch or Wicker Man. As a fan of those two movies, I must say it's not good at all. Maybe it's a bit similar in the aspect of form, but not the meaning. Those two movies have ideas and messages in them, they are deeper than a random scary things full of gore.Yeah, I absolutely got their men-exploits-nature statement. It could basically be ok if it wasn't so plain, naive and right in your face. Not to mention dozens of plot holes, a predictable plot and lack of characters' motivation. I also find it very frustrating that the island the story takes place, as well as the cult seem to lack any lore at all. Like, the writers just mixed all possible cliche in a single plot just because everyone does that, and didn't care about tying it all together. (Has anyone understood the origin of that vine-masked guardian guy? Wtf is he and if he's the keeper of the old lady god, then why did he attack the main character?).I was also absolutely bored by tons of unnecessary graphic violence which does not serve the plot in any case.The soundtrack is mostly the same music theme playing over and over again.This was the only movie I had uploaded for an offline watch to my phone, so I had no other options to watch. In this case, it is watchable, if you are ok with tons of graphic violence and stupid horror aspects. In any other case, just take another movie, there are so many good ones that this one can easily be skipped. If you want a good destructive cult movie, better watch Midsommar or the classic Wicker Man, those are masterpieces.",Apostle
314,odmanout,"Not a fan of modern horror, but wow.",9,13 October 2018,"While I enjoyed the VVitch, it seemed a bit slow. This movie takes that tone and runs with it. I would say it's sort of like Wicker Man meets the VVitch with a soundtrack like There Will Be Blood. I read a review that said there was a ton of violence (especially towards animals). Made me think it would be as bad as Canibal Holocost. That, it was not. I assumed I wasn't ready for the amount of violence, but honestly, it was done with some restraint. Enough to frighten, but being a fan of the raid, I could be biased. I honestly didn't think Gareth would have the chops to make a good horror film, but lo and behold, the cinematography was excellent, acting was great, direction and pace was fine. Maybe the VVitch made me ready for something slower, but the supernatural elements were a bit of a surprise. Great horror movie. Watch the trailer. It's exactly what the trailer says it is.",Apostle

I've seen Lifetime movies with better character development, acting, and most importantly- sensible plot developments. These people built this island from nothing, yet where did this elaborate underground tunnel come from? There's no way the three original founders built that themselves and if other members helped, wouldn't they wonder why it was connecting to a large barn in the woods? As other reviewers have mentioned, changing of the entire town into black and hoods was a miraculous and unexplained feat. And the two characters with a vested interest in stopping the torture just *happen* to arrive seconds too late. The violence was gratuitous, but honestly I was so emotionally disconnected from the characters that it didn't even seem that palpable.I so wish I could regain the hours I lost on this nonsense.",Apostle

Movie itself is very layered and full of religious simbolism. Set in 1905 it well portrays fears of men that lived in that age. But, the main story is actually a methaphore for modern society. It's about how we see nature and Earth today, and how we treat it. It is noticeable that this movie is homage to The Wiker Man, but it's very well composed so you can't say it's a plagiarism. Also, I think there's a lot of Lars von Trier influence. It reminds me of movie The Witch, too. Despite of not that much known cast, acting is really great.
I saw a lot of negative comments about this movie, primarly because of the gore and too much blood. Well, I have to say that this is not movie for everybody, you need to be used to blood on the screen. And also to understand how to find hidden meanings of the plot.",Apostle

Supernatural meets gore is also ok I guess.
But story not great. And the story telling is not credible due to many illogical things. Yes people can believe in ghosts and hobbits and tree-people if you create your story with those things, but they all need to operate within a consistent realm of logic and rules.
Eg: A witch who's a part of a tree and the island, is an ok concept, and who seems to need to be fed human flesh/blood is also fine. But her powers are pathetic so I don't know why the film used her to deliver its horror effects? It just became confusing when I simply see her as a disgusting character rather than a scary one. The instruments of ""purification"" used by the humans provided much better horror effects.
In short, I appreciate the film has a plot to deliver but the story telling falls well short in terms of characters, logic, flow and credibility.",Apostle

And most of the time its just boring handfights or some guns are fired, nothing special. I feel like I have already seen everything before, in another movie or games.

This movie has great scenery, colours were good, it wasn't too dark like most of horror movies, it was perfect balance between light and dark colours. Costumes were okay as well.
Story wasn't perfect but it did keep me on the edge of my seat and I did not get bored for the whole 2 hours. For a thriller it was a great movie but felt short on horror part.
Special effect were good, I did not once see that something was badly edited and that id didn't feel real.
Sound was very very good, unlike most of the movies, this movie had balanced sound and I did not need to turn the volume up and down for certain parts of the movie.
Acting was good, yes it felt a bit short on emotions and it could be better but overall its pretty good.

I'll keep this brief.This film is an absolute gift for anyone who loves true horror. Much like The VVitch it is a beautifully acted and written period piece set in the early 1900's. The pacing is perfect, the tone is driving and rhythmic, never was there a point during this film where I was bored. The characters were fleshed out and easy to empathize with. Overall I thought this was fantastic. I think it's almost a waste that its a netflix film and did not get a theatrical release.

369,sacrilegious-76248,It's weird (spoilers),5,23 October 2018,"This movie confused me on so many levels. So many unanswered questions and plot holes! I get it's some kind of allegory about faith and belief and how men will fall to corruption no matter their best intentions. There were a lot of unnecessary side plots that didn't make an impact to the overall main plot line. There is a Godess on this island. Who is she, what is she about, how she came to being, all these go unanswered... she is a goddess that gives life yet is so easily imprisoned by mortal men? What was that creature man with the head wrap about? Is she some kind of vampire? Why does she need blood and how come she can seem to move around freely in some scenes but at the end she was so pathetic? Why did they use so much fake blood and what's with the long drawn out torture scenes? This was not a terrible movie- it did keep me interested until the last half hour till all was revealed at the end- but it was so damn unsatisfying. It kind made me feel like they were trying to do something like Bone Tomahawk- you were learning the plot as the movie progressed and you didn't have to know too much about the 'creatures' because you were rooting for the human protagonists the whole way. However in this movie the entire story was centred around a cult and religion and their 'diety' was kind of integral to the entire plot line yet they kept that part of the origin kind of obscure and fuzzy, you couldn't quite wrap your mind around understanding how or why their cult came into existence! All you see is that it was about a rescue. Rescue from a cult led by some men that were trying to accomplish what exactly? A utopia? A commune? Their own country? Just a strange 2hr movie. Good cinematography and acting though. Watch only if you're a dedicated horror fan.",Apostle

There could have been much better acting and fewer minutes, but the fault lies with focusing on the less fascinating aspects of the islands cult.
What the viewer would like to see is not another frowny faced dirty man claiming knowledge, but more of the botanic deity and perhaps how it was captured. That would have given it a timeless dignity, much like the Grecian mythology and it's stories of dealings between deities and humans.
In the film's context a prosaic earth-bound religion would have meant much more of an sensible anchoring to the story than worshipping and praying to the holy father and his celestial power.",Apostle

374,ceddamaged,The real miracle: a Netflix production that doesn't disappoint,8,24 November 2020,"Apostle is a 2018 period live action-2D animatedhorror film written, directed and edited by Gareth Evans and starring Dan Stevens, Lucy Boynton, Mark Lewis Jones, Bill Milner, Kristine Froseth, Paul Higgins and Michael Sheen. It had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest in September 2018. The film began streaming on Netflix on 12 October 2018. The story follows a British man as he attempts to rescue his sister from an evil cult on a remote island.First I was afraid (but not petrified), because almost all of the Netflix productions I've stumbled onto were flawed movies with annoying political correctness sprinkled here and there, when it wasn't the full movie whose only goal was apparently to spread a political/sociological agenda. This is not the case here.
I think I know what pleased Netflix here: a good part of the movie is an harsh criticism of religion (linked to catholicism of course), and also an attack on the traditionalism, but this time it's subtle enough to serve the story.
I knew Gareth Evans for his two extremely awesome and graphic Raid movies so I was really curious to see him in charge of another story. He didn't disappoint.
From the mystery of the first part to the violent climax, the director knows his job and builds a tense suspense, followed in the last part by several bloody explosions of violence. The SFX are great and some tortures even look painful. The main characters are interesting enough to care about what happens to them. I read in some reviews that the second part of the film was just an accumulation of violent scenes, I beg to differ, it's not a silly gorefest, just the logical follow up of all the released tension. I also really liked the mystical/fantasy aspect of a few scenes, with discreet but relevant pagan influences. I'm looking forward to see anything by Gareth Evans.",Apostle

378,bradyconley,What a mess.,2,13 October 2018,"I heard good things about this movie before it came out on Netflix. I think those people watched a different movie than what was advertised.First of all, this film explains absolutely nothing. And I understand that movies can do that and do it well enough for the audience to piece things together; in Apostle this is just not the case. Seemingly random things happen for no reason and nothing is clarified for the viewer on why people do certain things or act a certain way.Second of all, THESE CHARACTERS ACT IN SUCH OFFSETTING WAYS OF THEMSELVES. They make decisions that directly counter something they just did. Almost nothing the lead does makes sense. The dude watches a few guys drag his only real friend on the island away with intentions to kill him then SPOILER: they kill him. Dan Stevens does nothing during the murder. Then suddenly he straight up kills two of the bad guys in a matter of seconds like John Wick. Where were those moves ten minutes ago, Danny boy? This is just one example of the ridiculous contradictions plaguing this movie. Listen. Long story short, don't buy into the hype this movie had a few weeks ago. It's not good.
Oh and it's over 2 HOURS LONG. If I wanted to watch a man go insane on an island and actually be entertained, l'll watch The Wicker Man. That should tell you something.",Apostle
379,hammersb-29911,A blood soaked supernatural horror,6,22 October 2018,"A devoted christian man travels over sea to a remote island, where he is searching for a missing girl expected to have been abducted by the inhabitants of the island. Arriving, he is disturbed to find himself tangled up in sinister cult that rules over the island and all its people.
No, this is not a synopsis for The Wicker Man. Instead, Apostle feels like Gareth Evans (Director and Writer) has used the classic film as a template for creating a nastier, gorier picture.Dan Stevens plays Thomas Richardson, a devoted christian who sets out on a dangerous mission to rescue his sister, who is being held ransom by cult leaders from an isolated welsh island. Once he has arrived on the island, Thomas must convince the cult leader, Malcolm (Played by Michael Sheen), that he belongs, whilst carrying out a search for his abducted sister. As Thomas digs deeper into the dark secretes buried beneath the island, he becomes at risk of being swallowed by the same forces that have hold of his sister.As you would expect from the calibre of actors involved, the performances are near flawless. Having followed Stevens since his brilliant breakout performance in The Guest, he has consistently pushed himself into a variety of roles. A career path which has led him to his most complex role yet in Apostle. Stevens successfully portrays a rugged, shrewd man, whilst not hiding the scars (both mental and physical) Thomas carry's from his past. Michael Sheen does what we have come to expect, as he plays the heavily layered Prophet Malcolm, leader of the cult. Despite his position within the hierarchy, Malcolm begins to question some of the decisions being made around him, allowing for his weaknesses to become more present to his following.Cinematographer Matt Flannery, who has followed Evans across all of his projects, has done an amazing job. There are some beautiful shots, and despite grim and gory imagery that often feels to be lacking any boundaries, the scenes are shot in inventive and intriguing ways to keep us watching in horror at what is unravelling. This is continued in some of the more subtle scenes, in which background imagery is used brilliantly to ramp up the unsettling and tense tone of the film.As come to be expected from the team that brought us the genre defining Raid films, the action scenes are excellently choreographed and shot, as we see Thomas battling both human and supernatural beings. In particularly one incredibly claustrophobic scene involving Thomas wading through blood and guts.This point is what leads me into the films main flaws, as the film is let down by a weak script which highlights Evans difficulty in building an effective story around the action set pieces. As the film progresses past the Wicker Man elements, the story becomes unfocused on where its trying to lead us. Many interesting ideas are brought up, but come the films end, very few are fleshed out enough to leave any lasting impressions. With a running time exceeding 2 hours, the film drags it's feet during the first hour, setting up too much for the film to be able to handle. As the films lets loose in the final 30 minuets, horror fans will definitely find enjoyment from the sheer madness and unpredictability as blood becomes a prominent feature. But even after each of these scenes, I find myself not particularly attached or engrossed in how the story and its characters progress.With strong performances, good action set pieces and great cinematography, this definitely isn't a film without its merits, although definitely requiring a strong stomach from the viewer. Gareth Evens continues to show us that he is a strong filmmaker when it comes to shooting action set pieces. But with weak story and characters outside of Stevens and Sheen, I struggle to see myself wanting to revisit. The only real lasting impression the film has had on me is the feeling of wanting to revisit the Christoper Lee classic.",Apostle

There's something off about the main character. The role doesn't suit him at all. I've been aware that I'm watching a struggling actor in every scene he was in.

I like Dan and really enjoyed him in this, it's a far cry from beauty and the beast or legion lol so fans beware, but overall he's a good actor and Micheal sheen was fab!Glad I decided to give this a go, if you like wicker man, vvitch and enjoy a bit of gore then you can pick worse movies to watch on a Saturday night.It's a solid 8 from me (yip that zippo lighter really lost it at least one whole point) as could prob have been condensed down a little, but overall a pretty solid horror movie.",Apostle

His ability to show angst and pain just wasn't on display here. All we get from him are open-mouthed and wide-eyed stars, overused and conventional tropes best left for the cheaper horror films that doth litter our landscape every so often.While watching ""Apostle"" I just had to force myself to imagine a better lead at the helm, say, Tom Hardy, Michael Fassbender or Benedict Cumberbatch. After that, the film becomes a bit more bearable. What I did like about the movie were some of the kills were creative; I hadn't seem them before.

388,alexbrosnahan,I made a account just to talk about how bad this movie was,1,9 March 2019,This movie may have been the worst thing i have seen in years. I always think netflix is worth a shot so we tried it out with the expectation of a b rate 1800's rip off of shutter island....it was not....this movie was terrible from the first scene. It was so bad i stopped it thinking i just be at the thirty minute mark and i had not even gotten twenty minutes in. The main character acts like a vengeful angry son ( no context and don't worry they never give you any later) to rescue his sister who was taken? So he just hope aboard boats with super close secret religion and no one questions fact no one has ever met him except one lady and he basically was like oh hey ya now we know each other. Then the movie plays the secret of the islands game and builds intrigue slightly toward that...which then just dips out of and doesn't explain...they then have religious service??? Seemed mostly just moral lessons and some anti king talks with some back story of the founder. Anyway the plot makes some weird hints at romance for main character and a female lead who is heads daughter...dont worry that never develops either. Then we see some teenagers we grow no emotional attachment to have awkward romance scene....then the boy catches the protagonist snooping around and he catches them sneaking back in so now the boy is blackmailed to help him??? Dont worry nithing develops...litterally this is a chain of loosely connected plot ideas they filmed and said eh close enough to a movie....the dialogue is goofy and choppy timing and behavior of characters is ridiculous..(carry person off scene they then run into a room and person is chopped in half and clearly being proccessed less than 4 minutes later) no explanation of super natrual forces. No real explanation of motives of characters....a giant cluster with terrible acting awful costumes no real plot...i just am more amazed at how bad it was than anything...there is a moment about ten minutes in was so shocking i actually thought might be good at first ...but now looking back even it was bad...a lamb falls through canvas of their boat...(not sure from where) and guy tries to save it another person throws off the end of the boat and says we do not interfere....looking back where dud the animal fall from and second the boat had no back...like thing slid off floor into water. Anyway if this review made sense and didnt seem like strange ramblings then this movie is for you,Apostle

391,Boyo_Reviews,The story telling really throws me off,5,24 September 2019,"Apostle is a thrilling folk horror film with a two hour and ten minute run time which starts with a strong steady pace and somewhere along the way it stumbles over itself.This film presents the viewer with some very interesting ideas, which develop into some horrific and jaw dropping scenes; one at which I could help but hold my hands over my face and cringe at the sounds being presented to me! However, with great ideas being presented such as a chilling setting, strong ""demand your attention"" performances from the actors, roller-coasters of emotions, and give you goosebumps creeps; the film begins to fumble over itself.Without really giving away any spoilers, the film establishes a goal for our main character that of which slowly dissolves into multiple micro stories, all of which come to one final conclusion. Not that there is anything wrong with this algorithm, it's actually one that works very well a decent amount of the time in other films. In Apostle I found myself wanting these micro-stories to wrap it up and move on as I had either lost interest or I noticed the writing and overall quality start to dip and eventually just fizzle until something gruesome happened on screen to grab my attention again.Somewhere along the way in the writing of this script you can tell someone at some point got lazy. Apostle has great pacing which then turns into constant ups and downs of interest and writing. Especially towards the last 20-30 minutes I found myself asking ""Where did this come from?"", as it was something I did not expect nor understood the ""major"" relevance of some events. Which wraps back to my point of losing and regaining my interests throughout the film. It seems the writers/directors thought ""oh this isn't scary enough...add a gory scene to hold the interest of the audience!"" and this is exactly what happens.In conclusion I will find myself remembering certain scenes from this film but asking myself ""wait, what movie was that from"". The constant change of pace and the film playing tug-o-war with itself till they find the story throwing itself together at the most convenient time. With Hostle or Saw level gore scenes along the way to keep you tied in. Overall, outstanding effects and performances but the film loses its footing half way through till it gets its balance.",Apostle

393,iveywiveypoo,Wtf,1,20 March 2020,"I watch horror movies a lot I enjoy them. To call this a horror movie is an over exaggerating, sure its gory but that's about it. It lacks a distinct plot line, people and their deaths are extremely irrelevant they're just there to add more gore and slightly upset you. You dont really know who the real ""villian"" is until like near the end. It doesn't even explain one of the creepier characters. It made no sense I was lost the whole time, good general idea but executed terribly.",Apostle
394,awtchghrrvr,"Intelligent, though not masterful.",6,6 April 2020,"Interesting shots and cinematography though not consistently well done. Certainly the score offers a few intriguing moments. Great performances from Michael Sheen, Dan Stevens and Kristen Froseth. Many reviewers believe the build up to be compelling whilst the answers it provides are sub par, personally I found the ambiguous conclusion to be intriguing. The film is by no means a masterpiece, that being said I found it to be quite compelling. The the plot at times relies on convenience and coincidence, the dialogue certainly works to build the ambience, tension and invest you further into the early 1900s world. Though at times it dips into needlessly gory self indulgent scenes, the film overall is by no means, entirely frivolous.Spoilers ahead so be warned.
Whilst some came into the film expecting a story grounded in reality (and the film at times seems to build upon this) only for it to be revealed that the paranormal aspects being hinted at are in fact a reality within the film, some may turn them off of the film as a whole. However, upon my second viewing, I found these answers to be more intriguing rather than the usual ""crazy cultists"". The ending leaves a lot up to interpretation, but I found the protagonists subtle struggle with addiction to be quite compelling whilst he searched desperately for his missing sister. Only for the story to be become more layered as questions are continually answered.
Overall, by no means is it a marvel of filmmaking nor a film for everyone. But rather, serves as a benchmark of Gareth Evans growth as a filmmaker, and I would be remiss if I didn't recommend to any horror fan.

Pacing was amazing and I never felt bored or hoping for the plot to move forward.No, it's not just a gore-fest. You can tell that the director is well-versed at utilising the shocking effects of gore to advance plot points and provide a visceral form of morbid entertainment to pair well with the deeper subtext of the movie.No, it is not totally inauthentic to the time period. Certain liberties were taken with the village to portray an aura of primitiveness and simplicity - not unlike what you'd think about when seeing an Amish settlement in this day and age. Otherwise, clothing and most of the other accessories (such as lighters, lamps) were period-appropriate.On the fence about it being disjointed. In hindsight there were several plot points or players involved that were either not explained or totally irrelevant to forward the premise of the movie. However, they were entertaining enough on their own such that they did not distract the viewer or force an even greater degree of suspension of disbelief.Yes, there are absolutely strange and inexplicable actions taken by the characters at times. It might make you go ""what in the actual f...?"", but the moments pass in short order and you're back onboard in no time. What horror/thriller movie DOESN'T have this criticism leveled at them anyway?YES, this film is beautiful. The cinematography blew my mind. A multitude of gorgeous, almost dream-like shots, editing and post-production that effectively conveyed the director's desired emotion, a brilliant job done in the costume/make-up department, combine effortlessly to draw you into the make-believe world that is presented to you. There are a few scenes in which the camera lingers on a face - no dialogue, no music, no action; just raw (and very well acted) emotion playing across the visage. Powerful stuff.I'm not one who writes reviews or is well versed in film and cinema, so pardon the amateurish points above. However, the fact that a movie has pulled me out of the woodwork to write about it in a public forum should say something about this film.

406,persa-alex,Full of directing cliches,2,3 May 2020,"I have to write this review because i have to do something while i wait for the movie to end. It is a movie that feels made by a black metal fan (a Cradel of Filth fan, not even a Marduk or a Emperor fan) for the ""normal"" people. SCENARIO:
This movie is a unfocused mess, it is not heading in any direction, is like the director didnt knew how this movie will end and he didnt try to prove a point, all he knew is that the movie will need to have a positive end because thats how people like them. He used religion as a theme just as a highschool band uses religion as a theme to create something defiant and creepy. Many parts of the movie are illogical (i wont go into details so i wont spoil it but are many many MANY problems with the scenario). If this movie would've had sense it would've ended in 15 minutes.DIRECTING:
Awful, it doesnt have AMAZING scenes of combat as ""The Raid"" movies (kudos ot the indonesian actors) but what i hate the most is the way the director tried to make it as ordinary and cliche as possible, probably because it had to fit in some lame Netflix lameness standards. The only thing that is nonconformist about this movie is the length, probably Netflix pays by the minute. There is nothing horror about this movie, is just sadism. There are some moments when it is hilarious.ACTING:
Probably is the best part of the movie, some people tried their best but some were awful. The first clew that this movie is actually bad is the acting of the daughter of Frank (Lucy Boynton), totally awful performance, another thing that was hilarious.OST
There are some sounds there... i cant call them music. Sounds very ordinary, definitely not black metal.VISUALS
A lot of ketchup and makeup. This gets also hilarious at some points. Some scenes look very good, like Sleeping Hollow, or something.Overall what i hate the most about this movie is that it starts well, it is made by a director who made 2 great movies (at least, The Raid series), it has a good image and you expect the movie to be good... and, damn, it has 2 hours and 10 minutes...",Apostle

It's confusing from the beginning. Who's the ransom for? Why is there a ransom? Where is the island? Scotland? Who knows because it never tells you. What religion are those people following? Is it a Christian/Pagan blend? Are they Puritans, Pagans, what? Why does the movie info say this takes place in the year 1905, but everybody on the island act like and talk like it's 1750?

I saw the trailer for this and was very excited, that and the fact it has had some good reviews here (how anyone can say this was even mildly entertaining is beyond me!). The film DID not live up to the trailer in the slightest!The first 20-30 minutes of the film worked really well in building tension, and I can't knock it for that. I had this constant insidious feeling that something purely horrifying was going to happen...how I was wrong!There were a few 'shocking' moments and it was well acted but this film completely loses its way and makes very little sense. I don't think a single one of the questions that was raised throughout a very long, drawn out and tedious film, were answered.I see some reviews have put this in the same vein as The Witch, I can assure you it isn't! The Witch was a horror masterpiece and aside from this being set in a simialr time period there is nothing similar.Do yourself a favour and give this film a miss, just enjoy the trailer and leave it at that!",Apostle

Also, their scenes of torture are too much and some other movies did them better.

Though even as a horror fiend a few scenes I found hard to watch.
I genuinely can't understand why people dislike this film. People are saying the movie didn't make sense or not much happened and I have to ask did they watch the same film? The pacing is a little slow at occasions but overall good and the story & themes although weird makes sense in context and is quite clear. I will definitely rewatch this movie and even looked to see if I could buy it for my Blu-ray collection I liked it that much.

Being a fan of the genre I had to finish to see how it all ended, but I guess in short this movie was a tease, it appears to be a twisted gory cult film but is really just a gory drama. 2/10 would definitely NOT recommend this to a friend.",Apostle

The movie itself is visually stunning and I love Dan Stevens, but the story was lacking. All the characters had little to no background story, which left me wondering so many things and feeling very unconnected. Nothing really seemed to make much sense. I mean, I didn't find myself confused, just baffled as to what the people who made this film were thinking. I don't recommend this to any horror fan. Just because it has unnecessary torture scenes and lots of blood doesn't necessarily make it horror. This film is a sloppy mess and a waste of time.",Apostle

441,douglaswelch,Very disappointed,5,29 October 2018,After the amazing Raid movies I expected so much more from this one. There was some very graphic and brutal violence that reminded you that it was a Gareth Evans movie but the characters all lacked anything resembling motivation.

It has no modern horror elements with cheap jump scares.

445,jonnyepps,Best thriller I've seen in a long time!!! This deserves praise.,8,26 January 2019,"I really don't understand the intensely negative reviews. It is a brilliantly made film, beautiful cinematography, the sound editing was masterful, the effects were brilliant, great use of colour and a decent script. Yes few things were unexplained and perhaps unnecessary but that didn't tear away from a genuinely exciting and tense watch.
I especially liked that there was no narration or pointless characters explaining everything along the way to help the viewer along who can not work things out for themselves, we discovered the secrets along side the protagonist and shared the mystery together.
People seem to be so hung up on the fact it is 2 hours long as if that's an unheard of length for a movie,, they must just be so used to the awful so called horror films which don't bother to take time to develop and just delve straight in to cheap scares, heavy music, awful script and a standard ending. This film takes its time, no scene is rushed, you enjoy every moment of it and take the time to keep your thoughts and ideas flowing.",Apostle

In this case, there is a typical formula for mass oriented Netflix product: good picture with deep colors and bunch of methods that we already saw anywhere else in nowadays, the emancipated keynote of female-characters and conflicts (men/nature for ex) and variety of populism issues. The conflict between antagonists is such a lame and each of them is faceless, they are not even weird nor creepy; the core of protagonist is stock and the cult is nothing of interest.

I think if you saw the trailer and thought about what the movie was well then you might have gotten bored during the movie cause youre anticipating some horror movie along the lines of the witch. Thats not gonna happen baby. Watch it if youre a fan of dan stevens, not the hugest fan out there but like after seeing him in one film you felt that hes got that pull that immerses you even if the films not that good. so i watched this because dan being in a gothic thriller was a draw for me. films like these are good enough to entertain you at home. Its a good enough film to watch at home only if youre in the mood for watching a creepy thriller. Its forgetable but entertaining.

Well acted, very well shot and it ultimately very satisfying too.
Some parts of the raid I felt were horror'esque in terms of the frightening tension and you can certainly tell its the same director for Apostle.
Gareth doesn't shy away from hardcore violence and it fits.
There aren't any jump scares per se but ramped up tension throughout, I got the feeling of the wickerman (cult, island, sacrifices for crops etc) but with more lore and reveals which I liked.

In 1905, the Qing Dynasty was about to end, and with all those invaders, China was a mess itself. So in what world they could do that?
Despite the history of China, the story is also crap. When the main characters could run away, they chose to chat with each other:) How's your tea party? The fight scene is too long and too illogical. Thomas could survive, or at least die in a reasonable way, instead, he was stabbed to death by a man who was already wounded and stabbed by him on the neck, on the neck!

a disappointment. Unfortunately for me, it turned out to be the latter.
The plot itself showed great potential; a man disturbed by his past agrees to go and rescue his sister from a group of heretics that live on a remote island.
The problem is how the whole story came together, there were too many plot holes, the pacing was off and there was much emphasis on the gore aspect of the movie. For instance, the scene were the ""masked man"" attempted to kill the protagonist. It didn't make any sense for this ""man"" to want to kill the protagonist if you see what comes next.
One thing to consider, is that they also added some supernatural elements which did not help make the movie more interesting, on the contrary, it only made it more boring.
They tried to make a horror movie by using gore, blood and senseless killings, undermining the great story that could have been unfolded.",Apostle
480,stefanieyasemin,Riveting,9,28 October 2018,I'm not good at leaving reviews but I'll give you my opinion. I thought it was a very good movie. Didn't seem like it took two hours. I would have to say it's a matter of taste with this movie and every other movie. Good and bad reviews have some truth to them. I definitely liked the movie and would say give it at least one chance,Apostle

482,joemetheny-31960,Anachronisms & gore. But a good story.,6,7 November 2018,"The story is really well done. But the production is a bit lacking. To say the least.
My biggest problem was that the story is apparently based somewhere in the 1700s, but the main character uses a Zippo lighter, they are loading flint locks with modern Shotgun shells (and they have no problem with the closeup when they do it). They wander around in the dark with electric lanterns. And in the gory part where they purify a teenager, is done with a hole saw mounted in a modern Chuck to a hand drill.
But other than that. It's not too bad.",Apostle
483,Weylyn,Wasted 2 hours,1,10 November 2018,Don't believe the high stars.. probably an attempt to give this movie more views.. only bad reviews and suddenly a row of high one's.. for real this movie is not worth it,Apostle
484,gemmabolamskillsnetwork,Amazing,9,24 November 2018,This was probably one of the best films I've seen this year. I totally loved it!,Apostle
485,stumad,Classic!,10,26 November 2018,"Riviting escapism at the highest quality. If you love great horror/thriller, with a score that'll make you winch every time you clang a pot.Awesome, make more please.",Apostle
486,flynncam,Beware of high praise and scathing critique,6,11 December 2018,"The people giving this film 10/10 are being too nice and those giving 1/10 are being overly critical. The truth, for whatever my opinion is worth, is somewhere in between. The acting is actually quite good, with Michael Sheen giving a particularly extraordinary performance. The setting is beautiful and the film overall beautiful to look at.The concept is interesting as well and the first 45 minutes actually seem to fly by because the premise is so compelling; you'll want to know what's going to happen. Unfortunately, the plot seems to slowly deteriorate after that as Gareth Evans remembers that he needs to throw in a healthy amount of gore to please his greatest fans and the storytelling takes a serious hit in the process. It ends up somewhat confused and chaotic and not in an interesting way.",Apostle
487,celadictos,False advertising,3,31 December 2018,"In a modern horror film, it's a great idea to explore the worst of humans nature to shock viewers. Living characters can be often more terrifying than supernatural beings when developed correctly. The plot, centered around a religious community located in the middle of nowhere (remote island), had everything to portray the horrors related to religious cults and fanatism. Somehow the director got everything wrong. Apostle lacks character development and focuses on graphic violence and poor dialogs. Talking about false advertising, the trailer was much better than the movie.",Apostle
488,wtennysonw,It starts with the script and this one was bad,1,18 February 2019,"Absolutely no story. None. No conflict. No rhythm and no flow. As one reviewer said it was like the director had 17 different ideas he was trying to cram into one film. And you could tell where during the writing process they just couldn't let go of a really cool visual they had even though it had nothing to do with anything.They seemed to forget about the part where he travels to the island to find his sister. That's the whole point. That disappeared right quick.The antagonist is over-the-top evil right off the bat and you don't really understand why they're there, what they really believe, what are the rules of their religion and why they're extremely pagan yet puritan at the same time.The lead has the same expression throughout the whole movie. The violence is absolutely unjustified. Even using a torture/death device to kill off a character for God knows what real reason that would have been more fitting in Hostel. Why was there an assassin who blurts out ""for God and country?""...what does that have to do with anything?? What connection do these people have to any kind of sovereignty?Why do they at times seem so playful in one scene and then in another are dressing up in black robes to brutally exterminate their community's loved ones and everyone's just OK with it.I'm a huge fan of exploitation movies, but this garbage is such shallow, gruesome, unstimulating, non intellectual trash and ironically is not trying to be an exploitation film, because it doesn't know what it is and is full of nonsensical violence to each other with shallow characters.I've got a half hour left and I'm turning it off. Do yourself a favor. Watch the original Wicker Man instead.",Apostle
