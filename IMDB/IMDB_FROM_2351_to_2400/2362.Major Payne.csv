0,SnoopyStyle,A few laughs A feel good movie Didn't expect much more,6,19 October 2013,"Maj. Benson Payne (Damon Wayans) is a super soldier, except he has failed to get a promotion for the second time and gets discharged. He finds his killing skills have little use in civilian life. His only job is to command a local school's JROTC program for a bunch of ragtag misfits. He finds his skills are not really appreciated by the kids either.Damon Wayans is doing a pretty funny bit here, but it could be tiresome at times. The good part is the kids. They all learn a good lesson and we have a good laugh over it. Sure he's a cartoon character, but that's what we expect. Nobody is expecting Shakespeare.",Major Payne
1,gavin6942,Who Put This in the Favorites Section? Arrrrrgghhh!!!,4,21 August 2006,"If this is someone's ""favorite"" movie, they need some serious help. There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. I haven't seen the original movie this is the remake of (some 1950s film), but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization.A major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element, and winds up teaching children at an ROTC school. Unfortunately, the major is Daman Wayans... so the children are in for a world of annoying, humorless asininity. Can Wayans whip these losers into shape? Can they get him to become a little more human? The film bombs as most Wayans films do, with only a few sparkling moments. William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time, fair too little. This charming old man (known best to me as a ""Tales from the Crypt"" actor, known best to you as Uncle Louis from ""Christmas Vacation"") shines every moment he's on screen, which isn't much here.Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which fits him perfectly. I wouldn't mind slightly more Bam Bam, but I think he carried the role of ""biker"" about as far as it could be carried for a military film.And then there's the attractive teacher, who someone falls for Major Payne even though he treats the kids poorly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with. She must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which (though it would seem ""stupid"" since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough).Wayans had one shining moment: a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice ""robot""), and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. This scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle.Seriously, avoid this film. If you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes, rent or buy ""Ernest Goes to Camp"". At least he's a lovable loser, and actually funny. Maybe if Major Payne had fought a badger I'd feel better, but he didn't. Forget Payne, forget Wayans... you can do so much better.",Major Payne
2,lee_eisenberg,"a nice way to pass time, but don't expect anything great",5,29 May 2006,"Before Damon Wayans started appearing in movies like ""Bamboozled"", he starred in completely silly flicks like ""Major Payne"". This one casts him as an ex-soldier who becomes a drill sergeant for a bunch of teenage losers. As you might expect, there's a lot of humor that seems like they deliberately wanted it to be stupid, but the movie does elicit a few laughs. Still, there are much better movies out there, so only make this your choice if there are no other choices (although I hold it in higher regard than I hold Disney's version of ""Cinderella""). Witless, but quite entertaining. In conclusion, you won't feel a major pain if you watch this.",Major Payne
3,ccthemovieman-1,"A Fun Film, But Not For Kids",5,13 October 2006,"I really liked this on the first viewing and felt the opposite the next time I watched. Funny how these things happen. I guess the first time I didn't mind the crudeness, kids' swearing and predictable ending. I guess I didn't feel that this would be poor examples for other kids to see. Well, I was wrong.Nonetheless, to point out the good parts, Damon Wayans was funny as ""Major Payne,"" dishing out some genuinely funny insult lines to the kids. The strange way he talks was pretty humorous, too. While the language is crude at times, there are no f-words or Lord's name in vain. Karyn Parsons is a new face and name and is a pretty woman, although her character was annoying at times. She looks and sounds a lot like Jada Pinkett.This is a fun movie...but I don't recommend it for kids.",Major Payne
4,Theo Robertson,MAJOR PAIN More Like,3,1 September 2003,Did anyone stop to realise what sort of movie they were producing here ? Now let`s a former marine officer becomes assinged to a group of kids at a cadet school so this should be a family comedy right ? Wrong . This is just a gross comedy aimed at teenagers with many bad taste moments .It might have been watchable in an extremely dumb way at this point but I found Damon Wayans voice to be irritating beyond belief . Does he speak like that in real life ? If he does then he has my sympathy but he won`t be getting any of my money from watching his movies,Major Payne
5,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not bad, just didn't find it terribly funny",6,23 August 2006,"I've watched this a number of times, and I still have yet to really find any part of it terribly funny. In spite of that, I will attempt to review it as objectively as I can. The concept is interesting, though the formula, basic plot progression and execution is something that we've seen before. The plot was fair. The humor is pitch black and then some, with violent verbal descriptions and images, to go with the lead being a tough Marine. The first few scenes detailing his personality, methods and preferred activities do a nice job of setting up for the rest of the film. We join Mr. Payne(a name I personally found was put to better use in the video game released half a decade ago, featuring a title character of the same last name, but I digress) just as he's being discharged from the Marines. There's no one left for him to kill. So what does a killin' machine do? Train children in the vein of his own training. The acting is fairly good. I must say, Mr. Wayans really surprised me. He clearly does possess more talent than one would think... and this is coming from someone who really does like the man, and watched as much of the sitcom that was named after him as I had the chance to. Say what you will about him, but don't claim that he can't act. Going about as far into the other end of the spectrum from the grinning charmer that he usually portrays, he's just about as hardball and nasty as you get, in this film. The cinematography and editing are decent enough... they do a fine job of making it all work and come together, without going above expectations or breaking any new ground. In fact, the same could be said about the writing. The soundtrack is adequately chosen. All in all, I'm sure this film has an audience... the sheer amount of positive reviews compared to negative ones on this very site support that theory pretty well. I recommend this to anyone who has read positive reviews and recognizes what they read as something they'd enjoy. 6/10",Major Payne
6,view_and_review,How to properly correct child behavior problems,9,5 January 2007,"As a whole Major Payne was one of the most funniest movies I've ever watched. The ingredients for this movie to be side splitting hilarious were perfect. Damon Wayans did an excellent job as Major Payne. He could have done spin-offs from that character alone. Then you add the kids; and it wasn't so much the kids as it was how he treated them. You come to expect a certain level of delicacy when handling kids even if they are the most spoiled, bratty, destructive kids alive. Major Payne took an unexpected approach by putting those kids through hell as though they were in boot camp with Sargent Hartman from ""Full Metal Jacket"". He berated them verbally and physically... he even insulted the only deaf kid. There was no political correctness employed at all in this movie. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, only if the other Wayans brothers could make movies as good.",Major Payne
7,anaconda-40658,Major Pain in the Ass.,5,30 June 2015,"Major Payne (1995): Dir: Nick Castle / Cast: Damon Wayans, Karyn Parsons, Steven Martini, Michael Ironside, William Hickey: Formula driven military comedy about an individual succeeding the thresholds of war and now reduced to a different trial. Damon Wayans plays Major Benson Winifred Payne who returns from a South American drug raid that contains a hilarious reference to Apocalypse Now. Unfortunately he is placed in charge of a group of misfit kids that he immediately lines up and unloads every insult possible in accordance to any physical standout in their appearance. This lands him in hot water with the mother of one of the boys. She is played by Karyn Parsons and her job is to lecture and predictably become the cardboard romantic interest. Wayans holds his own injecting harsh reality to these kids including an amusing sequence where he unloads his gun on a closet door to prove to one kid that nothing scary is in there. The pranks pulled by the kids always backfire proving Payne to be ahead of them intellectually. Supporting cast are an assortment of cardboard cut-outs. Steven Martini plays the rebel older kid in need of a reality check. Michael Ironside is wasted in one scene as an abusive father. William Hickey appears briefly to prove that he has more insects in his office than cans of Raid. While it satires military and behaviour, its delivery is a pain all its own. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Major Payne
8,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's hard not to laugh honestly,6,2 November 2007,"Last night I was looking for a movie to watch and I came across Major Payne, with Damon Waynes as the star. I wasn't too sure if the movie would work, from the looks of the cover, it just looked like an over the top comedy that would have forceful humor. But I have to admit that when I watched it, it actually made me laugh quite a bit. I know that it was a silly movie, but how could you not laugh at these situations? I just loved the whole introduction to the cadets, how pathetic they were and how they had to face Major Payne. This movie is by no means Oscar material, but it's just a fun little comedy that I'm sure will get you a few laughs. The story is Full Metal Jacket, just the more fun and light version.Major Payne is kicked out of the military after having a few ""anger"" problems. But he is given a new assignment, to handle a military school with little kids. The kids aren't exactly military material, they're skinny, fat, undisciplined, and over sensitive. It's Major Payne's job to teach these little one's his world of discipline. He drives them crazy, so much so, to the point where they wanna prove themselves and win the trophy against other tougher military schools and prove to Major Payne who's the best troop around.Major Payne is pretty stupid at times, but it was just a fun comedy. I couldn't help but laugh at the part where they hire Bam Bam to beat up Major Payne, it looks like the kids finally won and yet of course, Major Payne wins again. Not to mention when Major Payne was reading one of the kids a bed time story and how graphic he got with it, I know it was a stupid part, but it was just so funny to me. Major Payne is worth a look, I thought it was a cool comedy that put a different twist on boot camps all around the world.6/10",Major Payne
9,helpless_dancer,I laughed my head off,8,16 December 1998,"This one poked fun at the military schools and came off well. Good acting and funny script kept it going. I fell in the floor watching the Major eat, but do you really think a fine, foxy babe would be even remotely attracted to this animal? It was totally unrealistic, but was made for a big laugh so who cares?",Major Payne
10,GOWBTW,Funny and not as Payneful as it seems!,8,20 January 2007,"Damon Wayans puts out his best comical characters into action. He is ""Major Payne"", a hardcore Marine mercenary who is put in a military school, which is nothing compared to what out on the battlefield. I liked the beginning of the movie where this soldier gets shot, and Major Payne breaks his finger to forget about the gunshot wound. So when he gets discharged from the Marines, he has to find work. Very civilian challenged, he goes to this military school where he deals with a batch of ragtime losers. He handles these guys a little too hard. One of the younger kids was orphaned, and the other thought he could build trust with the Major. Two words, ""NOT HAPPENING!"" The kids he tortures can't stand him any minute. They try to spike his food with laxatives, a gassy backfire is what it resulted. They had to run around the academy in dresses. That's a total riot! They sent this motorcycle dude(Scott ""Bam Bam"" Bigelow,1961-2007), that didn't work. When the guys start giving him trust, the battlefield is like any other workday to him. He'll never change his ways, but he'll make you change you attitude! ""Major Payne"" is like ""Homey The Clown"" with battle-gear. But Homey would never stand a chance against Major Payne. Rating 3 out of 5 stars!",Major Payne
11,Rob_Taylor,Wow! A Wayans movie that is pretty good!,7,23 November 2005,"I'll admit, I found the thought of watching this painful. To say I'm not a fan of the Wayans is an understatement of giant proportions. But I have to admit, within a few minutes I was smiling and laughing despite this predisposition. I think the problem with the Wayans is when they get together they aren't funny anymore. But individually, they have the potential to add to a movie greatly.So it is with Major Payne. Wayans' nasal speech pattern could have been intensely aggravating, yet somehow it came across as just right. Neither too strong nor too whiney. The kids all give great supporting roles and nobody lets the film down.Another plus for this movie (at least as far as I was concerned) was its absolute failure to be anything like politically correct in regard to Payne's treatment of the kids under his charge. Too often these days we see movies that are soppy wet and dripping with syrupy goodness. It makes a pleasant change to see a film where that doesn't go on. Well, at least for the most part. Payne does ""mellow"" somewhat as the film progresses, but not to the point of a complete character reversal, thank god.Highlight of the movie for me was Payne's version of the ""Little Engine that Could"", as recited to a six year old. The story starts off normally, but steadily involves less and less ""Little Engine"" and more and more ""'Nam"" tales! The way that Payne throws out the horrors of war during the telling is just hysterical.Of course, it is a feelgood movie so you know everything will work out in the end. That doesn't stop you smiling the whole way through, or of hanging on Payne's every utterance (which are nearly always hilarious).I guess the movie is not for everyone, but take it from me (as an avowed Wayans hater!) that this movie is worth your time. If you don't like it by the time Payne does his ""Failure to communicate!"" line then maybe it isn't for you. As for me, well, it's forced me to re-evaluate my opinion of the Wayans clan somewhat.",Major Payne
12,fntstcplnt,Major Payne (1995),3,1 May 2020,"Directed by Nick Castle. Starring Damon Wayans, Karyn Parsons, Steven Martini, Orlando Brown, Chris Owen, Andrew Harrison Leeds, Albert Hall, Damien Dante Wayans, Stephen Coleman. (PG-13)Reworking of ""The Private War of Major Benson"" as a vehicle for comedy star Wayans; his cartoonish characterization (replete with a ""funny"" nasal wheeze of a voice) feels lifted out of the world of sketch comedy, and the movie is akin to a mildly amusing five-minute skit stretched out to an interminable hour-and-a-half. He's a gung-ho soldier without a war to fight, so he takes his maniacal martinet skills to a private school's Junior ROTC program to whip up a motley bunch of misfit youths into lean, mean fighting machines. Repetitive juvenile gags and humiliation aplenty, giving way to late-film sappiness, plus there's a shallow, chemistry-free romantic sub-plot only because the script said so. Not a total waste--the Spike Lee crack is funny--but an insipid slog to get to the few bright moments. William Hickey and Michael Ironside show up in pointless cameos.30/100",Major Payne
13,Terryfan,"Major Payne, nothing but a funny movie.",10,9 August 2006,"Here's a movie that I watch all the time.Major Payne is just a funny movie.It's a true classic.The jokes are just so well done that you want to watch this movie over and over again.The acting was okay, but is made up for when the way the movie is meant to be funny.The music is very good with a great mix of all kinds of music.I just have fun watching Major Payne.Overall if you want a classic movie that is very funny, then Major Payne is the movie for you.I give Major Payne 10 out of 10.A true Classic.",Major Payne
14,mitsubishizero,Damon Wayans' hilarious,9,9 June 2019,"This's another comedy the critics got wrong. Damon Wayans as the title character is hilarious. His voice, delivery and antics get more than enough laughs from the audience. He plays a former Marine struggling to adapt to civilian life after being discharged. After getting arrested for assault during a job interview for the Police Department he gets a job training a bunch of young misfits to win an upcoming competition. While training them he butts heads with the counselor Emily Walburn (Karyn Parsons) over his treatment of the cadets. Needless to say hilarity ensures.So yeah this movie's funny as well heartfelt though that's towards the end. I'd say check this movie out for yourself.",Major Payne
15,rebeljenn,"Not excellent, but it is funny",4,19 January 2006,"'Major Payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film does not really have a lot to offer, but it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. Don't expect it to be a memorable film, however. Just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's really all I remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, it is not a great film, and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.",Major Payne
16,manitobaman81,Good,7,1 September 2014,"The dichotomy in reviewer assessments of MAJOR PAYNE has, I fear, more to do with the reviewers' life experiences than the film. I waited years to see this movie. Now that I've seen it and read the other reviews, I wonder if I watched the same movie. The film is dull. The sets are strictly poverty row, the cinematography uninspired. There is absolutely no creepiness except for the ending. The actors walk through their parts. MAJOR PAYNE is like a time capsule, a reflection of a world long gone. After seeing the previews I thought I'd be disappointed; it just seemed wrong. However, on viewing the film I must say the persons involved did a credible job.",Major Payne
17,Timofey1980,A half-wit and a freak.,5,15 April 2021,"The major will never be promoted to the rank of colonel for one reason - he can only kill, he is simply not capable of anything else. He is being dismissed. The police work does not suit him, and our hero dies of boredom in one of the hotel rooms. Suddenly, he receives an offer to become a military training instructor at a military training institution. This funny comedy, full of funny jokes and funny situations, tells about how the relationship of the ""hard-hearted soldier"" will develop with young wards and one very attractive teacher.",Major Payne
18,fibreoptic,Surprisingly good!,9,30 January 2005,"Before i sat down to this i thought it would be a stupid kiddy comedy movie like something off Nickleodeon but i was wrong, this will appeal to adults just as much (if not more) than children. It's about a hardened kill happy Major who doesn't have anything else left to do in the army so his commanding officer gives him a job training a bunch of cadets.Daman Wayans is fantastic as Major Payne and really makes the character shine. This movie isn't about a bunch of unruly kids making Major Payne's life hell but more like the other way around. The children try hard to get rid of him but their attempts are all futile. It takes a good three quarters of the movie before the kids warm up to the Major. It really is a bit too formulaic near the end but i still think that this is a top notch movie mostly due to Daman Wayans. This guy should be in more stuff. A really funny movie that is for everyone and just when you think it's going to turn sickly sweet in a couple of the scenes....well you'd better watch it to find out. 9/10",Major Payne
19,superboy478,Damon Wayans is da bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,9,18 May 2002,"Major Payne is one of the funniest movies in the Hollywood community. I thought that Damon Wayans delivered a knockout performance as the loud-mouthed, gold-toothed, trash talkin, squeky voiced Major Benson Winifred Payne. He was so funny that I nearly had a heart attack while laughing at the same time.After a major drug bust goes extremely well in South America, Major Payne (Damon Wayans) returns to Parris Island, South Carolina and finds out that the U.S. Marine Corps is throwing him out of the military back into civilian life. After two weeks of civilian life, Payne is let back into the military under one condition: go to Virginia and train a group of delinquints for an ROTC program at Madison Academy. Payne regretfully accepts the job and puts each of the boys into 8 weeks of living hell! It becomes a fight because the boys do what they can to put Major Payne out of their lives!Damon Wayans (My Wife & Kids, Blankman) stars in this hilarious raunchy teen comedy that will leave you breathless by the end because you will be laughing your a$$ off! Trust Me!!!!!! HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHE!",Major Payne
20,PJS-5,"**,2 out of 5 stars, a somewhat funny but incredibly abusive film.",6,14 May 1999,"True I can well say the occasional amount of good damon wayans humor was pretty much the only good part of the film,I know it's supposed to be boot camp but did they had to get a 6-year old to go through the basic-training-styled verbal abuse,& seeing children getting pugnasciously beaten up just for some ""hunt the enemy statue mission"",so if it weren't for the damon wayan's styled humor the film would've gone down majorly & the ""trying to get payne sensitive"" was a bit of a good help,& the funniest parts of the films I thought were the ""I do feel like a jack&$^"" & the leave it too beaverish family moment in a Major payneish twist so you should really see it only if you're a Damon wayans fan or a fan to some or all of his movies.",Major Payne

22,AlienByChoice,"Oh, dear. I can think of a few ways to make this worse...",2,16 March 2003,"but there are not too many of them. Probably the worst ""major release"" film I have seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot, the cast or the acting. The problem is beyond all that. It lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not the funny kind) of everything that takes place on the screen. I don't know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably, because of Steven Martini. He really did try. Bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells. Avoid at any cost.",Major Payne
23,S_dot_M_dot,Major Win,6,22 September 2021,"Once there is no one left to kill, Major Payne (Damon Wayans) must face his most formidable foe, a group of mismatched misfit JROTC cadets. With the help of Emily Walburn (Karyn Parsons), Major Payne must guided his squad from losers, to winners.Right off the bat, Damon Wayans plays the perfect character. He takes charge of every scene he is in and sets the comedic tone for the entire film. The cast of cadets are a great compliment to Waynes and has a who's who of 90's child actors. Karyn Parsons is an excellent addition as the love interest, and mother figure to the kids.On a technical level, this film doesn't have much to offer. The soundtrack is a good edition and ties together the various set pieces. There isn't anything wrong with the direction, cinematography, score, they just don't stand out.This film will divide the general audience. There is no denying Wayans comedic performance is top notch, but some may find it childish and just annoying.

It's a movie about a Major who was discharged from the Military, and was assigned to an Junior ROTC program, it proves to be the biggest challenge of his life. He's is very sinister and cruel, but in a funny way. The way he goes about training his Cadets is amazing, as much as they wind up hating him, they wind up to be like a family in the end. They are a lot of sight gags in the movie, as I said the humor is excellent, Damon Waynes is excellent in this movie he is intelligent and hilarious. There are cameos from some other people in the movie like Micheal Ironside, Karyn Parsons was also excellent as the counselor she hasn't done much since Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, but this was excellent.. Overall an 8 out of 10",Major Payne

27,danzeisen,Want me to show you something to keep your mind off that pain?,9,1 June 2011,"My family was at the drive in packing up after the first movie when they announced Major Payne as the next movie- the four kids of course talked me into staying the first few minutes, and that was all it took. Within those few minutes we were swept away. Wayans characterization is pitch perfect and should have spawned a sequel, or as one reviewer stated a TV series. There is no political correctness here, just fun and humor that kids of all ages and my wife and I enjoyed. I am no longer married, but I did get the copy of Major Payne in the divorce and still watch it with the kids We laugh at it, remember the good times and can talk and still offer to ""Show you something to take your mind off that pain."" W.C Fields hated to work with kids because he feared they would upstage him. Damon Wayans has NO problem here. I wish more movies were funny on so many levels. Have introduced my youngest, who was not alive when the movie came out, to the Major. He still talks about Mr Peebody. This is truly an under rated gem of a movie and fun for the whole family. Come on, loosen up, there is a place for Citizen Kane, but there is also a need for irreverent humor and triumph over adversity. Be advised there is some foul language here, but nothing that most kids don't hear on the playground, or these days even at home. Laugh and enjoy, time for reflection later.",Major Payne

30,ggarytthompson,I've never ran into anyone who has not loved this movie.,10,13 August 2016,Damon Wayans at his best. No it is not a Dark twisted black comedy. It is light hearted and very very very funny. I have watched it repeatedly and also pulled up the best parts on youtube all the time. If it's not the funniest movie ever you will at least have a lot of good lines to use the rest of your life. Karyn Parson and the rest of the cast are great. Know wonder everyone writes a novel out here. I forget you have to at least write 10 lines. Really. Do they want you to tell half of the story. It is very very funny. You will not be disappointed. I guess I will have to keep writing for this line and one more so I can have this review posted.,Major Payne

33,cpbeau,"One of the most underrated films out there, a true classic",10,31 January 2006,"This is a great film that you can sit back with your children and watch again and again.The story is taken from an old Chuck Heston film called Major Benson's Private War that took a serious ""military man"" and put him in charge of a group of children in an ROTC unit.Major Payne takes that story and inserts Payne as the 1990s caricature of a Rambo-esq ""killing machine"" - with an over the top slant to make his character comical in nature.There are some tried and true story lines here. Payne's 'tough love' motivates the children and helps them to grow...but he also grows as a person through his concern for the children as well as a love interest. The children at first despise Payne for his tough methods, but they learn to respect him. Payne sees emotion and caring as weaknesses early in the film, but he learns to value those. We see that the kids can have discipline yet still be kids, and the adults can be strong role models and be sensitive.Wayans's voice and high strung nature may turn some off, but they truly accentuate his character.The film has a happy ending where all has turned out for the best.This is a film you can watch over and over. Very few of the jokes get old, and you find yourself repeating many of the lines back. A fun movie that has appeal for both young and old.",Major Payne

35,Johntrek187,This was always a consistent rental. Pure '90's joy.,10,6 August 2021,This film is criminally underated. The story is simple and moves along quick. It's just one quotable line after another. They insert some heart into it too in the relationship with the school counselor and in how the boys come together as a unit. Damon Waynes crafted an infinitely quotable character.,Major Payne
36,mperry35,Damon Wayans got this one right,9,4 October 2015,"Damon Wayans has always been a remarkably gifted comedian. That comedic gift was best displayed on In Living Color. For whatever reason, the majority of his movies were, in a word, disappointing. Much of that reason had to do w the writing. However, he found a formula that worked in Major Payne. Wayans does a good job of poking fun at ""gung-ho"" military type guys who struggle to assimilate back into society after yrs in the military. Obviously, his character takes that idea to the extreme, but that's what makes it amusing. Whether its sleeping w his eyes open, giving a girl a bullet (that he was shot in heart with) as a gift, telling tales of war at bedtime stories, or cleaning his gun upside down to relax, he only understands soldier life. Watching him bring that intensity to a bunch of miscreant kids is funny; As is his extreme lack of romantic savvy towards his love interest. You either love the flick or hate it. I've always been a big fan of DW's humor.",Major Payne
37,jimmy-21,A must see comedy!!!,8,9 February 2001,"Well in my opinion this was a really funny movie with plenty of really good gags suitable for all age groups! I have to admit that I'm a big fan of the Waynes brothers so i was delighted to see damon in this film. I think if you are into comedies then this is must see movie, but even if your not it's still worth a watch!!!",Major Payne
38,danielcraven,One of the funniest films I've ever seen.,10,13 July 2020,Usually the comedy dries out in some comedy's but this kept me laughing from start to finish.,Major Payne
39,jl1982,This movie aged really well.,9,20 August 2021,You will notice all the little adult humor that you didn't notice before when watching this as a kid. Damon is hilarious. Easily the funniest Wayans brother.,Major Payne
40,nickyeskens,"Tries a little too hard sometimes, but stays funny",7,16 January 2017,"Mayor Payne is a must see classic to me. I was only two when it came out, but I remember watching it as a young kid, and i watched it many times after that. Now being old enough to actually have opinion about the movie I wanted to re-watch it. And it did not disappoint. Damon Wayans as Mayor Payne is a comedic master piece. Every line he deliverers and every looks he gives is funny, even his laugh is hilarious. The movie itself is as good as a silly comedic movie can be, which is not amazing. BUT its cute. Watching the movie again made me realize there are some things that are weird, Like the deaf kid being able to hear. Of course I realize this is part of the movie, and its a message the movie is trying to send (I think its a good one) but its also a little hard to overlook. This movie is and stays very close to my heart, even though sometimes it tries a little hard to be funny and silly. I realize this movie is not for everyone but people who enjoy movies like Police Academy will find Mayor Payne a funny movie with a good message behind it. Now I'll make sure I watch it every year!",Major Payne
41,Lexicon,Not really that good,3,16 October 1998,"Major Payne was really not very good at all. Despite being funny here and there, the story was ridiculous and the acting was poor. Major Payne's voice and temperament were especially annoying. The idea was ridiculous and the things that the boys had to do in that film were even more ridiculous. I would not recommend this film to anyone.",Major Payne
42,smacback-715-605926,An all time favorite,10,24 January 2021,"This movie has so many great one liners. Ignore the uptight movie buffs and critics, they wouldn't know a funny movie from a hole in the ground",Major Payne
43,phillips-71247,Love this movie,10,2 May 2021,Grew up watching and it's damn hilarious. Can't wait for my kids to be able to watch.,Major Payne
44,pindy-57708,Ignore the humorless critics,10,5 December 2020,Loved this as a kid. If you don't like it don't rate it tubby tubby.,Major Payne
45,BobCritter,"Great comedy - a bit dark for some, though",9,27 February 2011,"Damon Wayans is incredible in this role. The best performance he has ever done. He totally sells out in the role. Tons of quotable lines. Tons of laugh-out-loud moments. A comedy that is as good the second time around as it is the first.Definitely not a comedy for everyone as I have been told. I will say that if you grew up in my household or was with me in boot, you will have no option but to crack up at the expertly written parody. If you grew up in a nurturing home, this movie may just come off as mean and unrealistic. There may certainly be more to the split in likes and dislikes than this factor, as Wayans and this type of humor probably won't appeal to everyone, but I think that may certainly be a factor.",Major Payne
46,muzukashii,Damon Wayans played the role perfectly...,9,29 September 2001,"I'm not much of a Damon Wayans fan, but this is one of my favorite movies. The cover is misleading since Major Payne doesn't smile much in the movie. I also don't think it is for children due to the profanity and adult situations.  Given the right target audience, though, this movie is hilarious.  If you have ever been in the real military (sorry AF vets), you should see the humor in a battle-crazed but hardcore military officer using adult military training techniques on children in order to teach them discipline and teamwork.  I don't think anyone could have played that role better than Damon Wayans. I believe this movie shows he has true acting talent which doesn't seem to show up much in his other movies.",Major Payne
47,ladysidhe,This one's a keeper...,10,22 January 2006,"Very rarely do I see a movie that makes me laugh out loud, much less one that makes me REALLY want to buy it. This was one of those rare times. This is the kind of movie that you tell your friends they just HAVE to see, and HAVE to buy to watch over and over.I was an ROTC student in high school, and while it's not even remotely as melodramatic as this movie, the drill team scene at the end brought back fond memories (yup, we really did cool drills like that)...Damon Wayans is just...damn, he's funny. The one-liners he delivers, and the way he delivers them, is too much. I'd love to see the blooper reel. If the movie was that funny, the bloopers would probably make you pee on yourself.It's funny, funny, funny.",Major Payne
48,betterskeith,very funny,8,6 September 2021,"This movie is funny, you won't be wasting you time by watching it.",Major Payne
49,Leon-56,"Funny, funny, funny.",8,1 August 2000,"I guess peacenicks and the sort would be offended by such 'violence' but no-one forces them to sit and watch, right?This movie is hilarious, especially after being mistreated by a Drill Instructor myself down in Parris Island. You have to be a Marine to understand that folks like Payne are not that rare, only they are more obnoxious about the pride of belonging to the Corps.Great family entertainment.",Major Payne
50,mafloblitz,Unpredictable unforgettable and basically painless,7,27 November 2020,"It was very unpredictable, you never knew what was coming, you would never guess the funny names he calls the kids, great comedy even for adults. You see i have a problem, whenever I am exposed to something cringe worth I cringe hard, more than most, and this movie wasn't cheesy to my eyes, I only cringed a few times. Very good righting for a kids movie meant for adults and kids.",Major Payne
51,Hades,You'd have to be there to truly appreciate this movie.,9,6 August 1998,"In general, this is a pretty funny movie.  But to truly appreciate it, you'd have to go through boot camp.  I saw the movie when it first came out, and I went through boot camp for the Marine Corps just this last year.  I saw Major Payne again a couple of weeks ago, and I'll tell you what, there is a lot of stuff that is much, much, funnier after having a drill instructor do the same to you.  If you are one of the few and the proud, I'd highly recommend this movie.  Trust me, you'll be able to relate.",Major Payne
52,audun-4,still laughing....,9,31 March 1999,"Major Payne is an extremely funny film.  It's so funny you might would want to join the military, just to find out.  Major Payne became my hero.  I've spent weeks trying to be just like him.  I've hit on girls using stuff from the movie.  Well, I made them laugh.  Just watch it.  You'll like it, if you're not one of those anti-military person without any humour at all.",Major Payne
53,dcorkill,one of the funniest movie in years,10,22 June 2001,"I think this would have to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It hasn't scored that well, but you are either a fan of these sorts of movies or not. I think Damon Wayans is a genius the way he makes it seem like the movie was written specifically for him.There are parts of this movie that nearly put me on the floor with laughing.I wish there were more comedies of this standard.",Major Payne
54,BrickTop,Unbeatable comedy for the right person in the right frame of mind.,10,11 January 2002,"You can pick up two things from reading other IMDb users' comments about this movie: 1) It's not for everyone so chances are you'll either love it or hate it, and 2) The frequency with which someone adds a comment is slowly increasing over time.  Both these things lead me to imagine that Major Payne has all the makings of a great cult comedy in the truest meaning of that term.If I were to offer anyone advice it would be to watch the first ten minutes of the film next time it's on TV.  If the style of humour seems amusing to you, settle in for the ride and you'll probably be laughing out loud a LOT. If it seems dumb and you don't get it, cut your losses, switch right off and do something more productive with your time, that way you'll be spared an experience you won't enjoy.  It's really that simple in this case.Me?  I had thought from the trailers it was going to be dumb but it came on TV and I started watching.  Straightaway I was laughing at the narration, Payne's excessively 'war-ey' attitude (""The sweet smell of mustard gas"" !!) and his voice, which you will also either love or hate.  The Apocalypse Now spoof had me hooked... I suspected it was going to be another one of those parody flicks like Scary Movie or Hot Shots, but was pleasantly surprised at the way it panned out.  The story is by-the-numbers cliched stuff, but it is essentially played with a straight face - there are no winks to the camera. Yet it still works, because even though they don't let on that they know, you still know that the film-makers are aware how cheesy it all is, and in fact I think they are gently sending up all those ""inspirational"" feelgood movies, without being offensive towards them.  This is achieved in part through Wayans' stand out performance, and the blend of realistic (Payne's behaviour towards his charges is apparently mirrored in some real drill instructors) with ridiculous (a 6 year old military cadet??!!)  Also, the director's use of music is inspired - consistently over the top at the right moment (eg ""Respect"") to heighten the humour.Standout moments for me were the 'Little Engine Who Could' scene and Payne's ""vision"" whilst waiting at the station.  Already I would like to get a copy of this movie as there were many many quotable one liners I would like to see again - as I said, it has the makings of a cult classic.  I would recommend it unreservedly to someone if I knew they liked this kind of humour; to everyone else... 10 minutes is the cut off point!I should just add that although I was in the R.A.F cadets at school, and have a brother in the British army (a Major, no less!!!) I have not been through the 'boot camp experience', yet still found the movie to be very funny.  Bottom line though, I can see it's not for everyone, so use your discretion.8/10 for me ? /10 for you",Major Payne
55,beauhale,Probably the worst movie I have seen this year,1,7 January 2002,"I view probably 200 movies a year both at theaters and at home and I can say with confidence that this movie is by far the worst I have seen this year (If not ever, however I have not actually seen ""Quest of the Delta Knights"" yet).  This movie is just bad joke after bad joke geared to the 13 year old and because I had he displeasure of viewing it on a bus trip I couldn't walk out.Do yourself a favor and skip this one in the rental aisle.  The four dollars could be better spent on any movie by numbers produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.",Major Payne
56,jvflyguy41,One Tubby Tubby...,10,19 November 2007,"My favorite movie of all time. I guess you could call it ""dumb"" humor, but hilarious nevertheless. Damon Wayans plays a killing machine in the US Military and is then discharged when ""there's no one left to kill."" He then take up a job as a ROTC commander at a Virginia school. From there, he turns the boys from ""turds"" to ""maggots."" The boys try to get rid of Payne any way they can, but Payne always prevails. After making getting some sensitivity training from Ms. Walburn, Payne begins to win over the cadets and successfully trains them for the Virginia Military games. I highly recommend this film, you are guaranteed to laugh more every time you see it!",Major Payne

59,hspryiv,Major Payne,10,24 February 2014,"Major Payne: ReviewAs with all movies, specific audiences are targeted to maximize a film's profit. Major Payne (Castle 1995), directed by Nick Castle, is no except to this ideology. Making over 29 million dollars since being released in March of 1995, the movie definitely had a specific target audience (imdb.com). This movie was for teens and tweens with stereotypical middle school boy humor. Major Payne is a comedy that portrays a hardened killing machine of a soldier who is transformed into a loving, friendly father/mentor figure.After watching this film, people will either absolutely love it or hate it. The script is full of hilarious one liners and bodily function type humor; while incredibly funny to some people it may be considered childish and impractical to others. Major Payne employs the use of stereotypes from start to finish. It is used in character development, the storyline, and even the film's musical score. None of the stereotypes disappoint. They are funny, well timed, and make for a movie that is hard to forget. Ultimately, Major Payne could end up being one of the next great cult classics like Monty Python: The Holy Grail.One of the wisest choices of the entire movie is the use of music throughout the film. At the start, Major Payne (the hardened soldier) is taking over a city and its drug lord single- handedly. The song ""Bad to the Bone"" is playing in the background typifying Payne's badass persona. Later in the movie, the song ""RESPECT"" is played to increase the comedic side of the story as well as increase the amount of sympathy for the boys in the JROTC and Ms. Walburn. Finally, at the end, while Major Payne is waiting for his train and completing his characters' transformation, the theme song for ""The Donna Reed Show"" plays in the background. Payne has gone from killer to father figure and the music has gone from hard rock to a sickenly sweet family friendly tune.Another aspect of the film is the choice of actors. Damon Wayans plays his role perfectly as Major Payne. His personality and standup comedy routine-like performance is exactly what makes Payne so funny and likable. He deadpans his lines as the killing machine of a soldier and yet has a very distinctive and trademark laugh to help with his transition as mentor/father. As for the character of Ms. Emily Walburn, Karyn Parsons is an incredibly bubbly individual who is precisely what every student would want in a school nurse. She is extremely attractive and dressed in short skirts, tender, motherly, and nurturing to a fault with the boys. Additionally, Steven Martini stars as Cadet Alex Stone. While Major Payne is the main character and undergoes the biggest transformation of character, Alex Stone's supporting character is the one the audience will most easily identify with throughout the movie. Stone's persona is that of a kid with a troubled past, an over-bearing stepfather, he is not respectful of authority, as well as refuses to take anything seriously. Payne's and Stone's character transformations are affected by each other. As Payne begins to soften, Stone becomes more sure of himself. As Major Payne begins to show interest and concern for him, Stone begins to show desire, respect, and proves to be a very effective leader. In the end, we see him as the heart and soul of the squad and having confidence in his own abilities along with the other cadets. The little used aspect of narration in the film provides context about situations in the movie. Throughout, Major Payne acts as the narrator to further show how tough of a marine he really is. One scene has him riding over to Madison Academy in a military hummer. Major Payne narrates by saying, ""Finally after two whole weeks of living a civilian's puke existence, I was back in the corps, back in uniform, and back to the sweet smell of mustard gas."" We are left with little to the imagination as to how tough Major Payne is supposed to be as the marine and drill sergeant.The story line is a familiar one: tough guy comes in, a woman and some lovable kids melt away his toughness, then a happily ever after ending to finish it all off. But while this is a comedy feature film, the underlying story is one of hard work, perseverance, and family. So even though a ten year boy will laugh and laugh at all the gags and crude humor, any parent would be happy to take their kids to see these kinds of values portrayed on the big screen. I know as an eight year old I loved the humor and memorized tons of lines that made even my grandparents laugh as I repeated the quips that included curse words. Major Payne shows the boys working together and becoming a family with Payne's mentoring. Payne goes from soldier/killer to mentor with a girlfriend. Ultimately, Major Payne works as a film because Damon Wayans portrays his character perfectly (Ebert). The movie is light hearted, funny, and memorable. It is also my family's favorite and has provided us with many fun evenings together. All in all, I would give Major Payne a 5 out of 5 star rating as a must-see movie because of the comedy and execution of the story line.Work Cited: Major Payne. Dir. Nick Castle. Perf.
