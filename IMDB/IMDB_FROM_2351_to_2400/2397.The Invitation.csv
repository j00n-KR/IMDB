0,SnoopyStyle,relatively good,6,17 February 2017,"Will (Logan Marshall-Green) and his girlfriend Kira are going into the Hollywood hills to attend a dinner party. They hit a coyote on the road and Will has to mercy kill it. His ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new husband have invited some of her old friends as well as some new friends. Will and Eden divorced after some unknown devastation. Eden had gone to Mexico to recover for two years. Will proclaims her new friends to be a cult.I like the coyote start. The first half has some nice tension but it's a little slow for me. There is a good reversal in the middle. The last half is good but it's not as intense as I like. This is all nicely made. I wonder if a female lead would be more compelling. Also the locked doors seem wrong for some reason and not in a good way. Overall, this is relatively good.",The Invitation
1,claudio_carvalho,Paranoia or Sixth Sense?,6,30 August 2016,"In Los Angeles, Will (Logan Marshall-Green) is driving to a dinner party with his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) invited by his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new husband David (Michiel Huisman). Will and Eden were in love with each other but when their beloved son Ty (Aiden Lovekamp) died, Eden vanished. Now she has returned apparently healed with David from Mexico where they participated in a mysterious cult. Eden invites her old friends Gina (Michelle Krusiec), who is waiting for her always late boyfriend Choi (Karl Yune); the gays Tommy (Mike Doyle) and Miguel (Jordi Vilasuso); the couple Ben (Jay Larson) and Claire (Marieh Delfino) for the dinner party. David also invites to the party the promiscuous Sadie (Lindsay Burdge) and the weird Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch) that they have met in the cult. Soon Will notes that the house now have security bars in the windows and David has closed all the exit doors. Further, David is trying to brainwash the guests with messages from his cult. He also finds a strong pill in the bedside table and he suspects David and Eden want to poison the guests. When he finds a message from Choi in his cellular, Will also believes they have killed Gina's boyfriend. Is Will paranoid or having a premonition?""The Invitation"" is a low-paced thriller, with a confused beginning and boring in some moments. The mystery is kept to the end and the surprising conclusion is great. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): Not Available",The Invitation

3,kosmasp,Too busy,10,27 June 2016,"While some invitations shouldn't be accepted in the first place, there are also people you probably should not have invited in the first place. And just like that, you find yourself in a house with a lead we are supposed to care for. And we do feel his struggle, his pain, but also his tendency to kind of lose it. But why you may ask, is this happening? We can't get any more in the head of the lead than we already are, so it's up to you to piece the puzzle.A great lead performance, with a wicked script that constantly is challenging the viewer to guess what is going on. It's wicked in the best sense possible and I certainly will not dive into more ""story"" (though some would argue I haven't anyhow up until now). But the way this progresses and the more is revealed, the more the viewer is intrigued by what is happening - or sometimes not happening. What and where do we play now? Can we believe what we see and what it ultimately means? This was one of my highlight films of 2015 and I may have added an extra point (so 9/10 may have been applicable too), but I just love how this played out ... literally!",The Invitation
4,Quinoa1984,"a dramatic thriller, more than a horror, with substance and raw emotion",7,14 April 2017,"The Invitation gives Karyn Kusama, from a script by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, a chance to come back to movies after a number of years away in the Genre Film Uncertainty. You know what that is, when a director gets sucked up into Hollywood and does some films for any number of reasons and comes out of it almost scathed (I haven't seen Aeon Flux, but Jennifer's Body was fairly weak tea). I think the strength for her here is that she has a lot to play with, almost like a theater director but with a damn fantastic cinematographer (seriously, Bobby Shore, pointing you out for good work), and it's about the tension that's about to pop that all she has to do is make sure the cast clicks well together. She's also wise to cast people who we may have seen before in some TV and character parts - Michiel Huisman and Logan Marshall Green, for example, have various recurring TV roles, and John Carrol Lynch is the one guy that will always stand out for Zodiac - but aren't household names (originally Zachary Quinto and Topher Grace were attached).By scaling it back a little, it has a true independent film feeling while at the same time the production quality is top notch as far as, again, the camera-work and all of her directions to Marshall Green as Will, who has to carry a lot of the suspicion and heavy dramatic feeling here. In a sense the first two thirds of this may throw off those thinking this is straight horror; it's creepy, and it's awkward (kind of like one of those cringe comedies but played deadly straight really, if one laughs it's out of temporary awkwardness), and it's really an examination of full-bodied grief. What happens when one has to face that every day? Does it get any easier? Can anyone let go of all of those horrible emotions? The 'game' of the title of the film, which one might think has some BS connotations about inner peace and, at worst, fooling oneself is.... well, you'll just have to watch, won't you? The last third of the film ends up becoming, frankly, what one might expect, and I wished the filmmakers could have gone in a slightly different direction - what if one kept up the dramatic feeling about this, for example - but that's also what's smart about the direction of the script. The uncertainty could go either way about how Will is reacting to this situation - is it cult or not (and in odd timing, seeing this not too long after the 40th anniversary of the Jonestown massacre, that was on my mind as well) - and while it ends up going in the way I thought (both in how it unfolds, the big OH S*** turning point, and who is who in the final stretch so to speak), it's handed with the same level of tautness and raw feeling that went into the rest of the picture.And then.... the very end, like the last minute, makes me take a full half a star off - it completely kills what should have been an easy enough way to end this story by shoving an unbelievable ""OMG Look what ELSE is going on!"" beat that is completely false and unrealistic (at least considering the realistic world that this is being staged in). Until then, this is a tense and taut and completely uncomfortable drama that dovetails into conventional horror in the last third, though not in a bad way. It shows that Blumhouse doesn't have a lockdown on single-location thrillers, and with substance no less (to give it a higher compliment, if Ingmar Bergman was somehow during the time of Jason Blum and wanted to quickly do something in between projects, he might've put out something like this... up to a point).",The Invitation
5,dbborroughs,This film makes no sense,1,3 January 2016,"The premise of the film has a man and his new wife/girlfriend going to a dinner party thrown by his ex-wife (who has just returned from a long time off the grid in Mexico) at his old house- where their son had died. Once they get there some ominous things begin to happen and the happy reasons for the party are fund to be rather quite dark.I am puzzled that this film is getting a solid buzz when the people I saw this with were kind of left scratching their heads. I absolutely hated the film finding it the sort of film where you have to not only suspend disbelief but kill it to have it make sense on any level what so ever. This is the sort of film filled with moments where you can't believe that anyone would be so stupid as to actually go along with any of it beginning with returning to a house haunted by memories to be with a woman you left on questionable terms. Once the cult leader locked the door I lost all respect as no one batted an eye to the obviously ominous way it was done.If you've seen any number of horror films you've been here before, especially anyone that involves a life changing new way of thinking. This was one of the worst films I saw in 2015 largely because it makes no real world sense-with a final denouncement that is beyond ludicrous.",The Invitation

The film keeps you guessing and throws in the requisite twists and turns that keep movies like this moving forward. There are some serious themes about grief and the different ways in which people deal with it thrown in to give the film some ballast, but it's mostly interested in ratcheting up the tension, which it does admirably.The viewer goes into a movie like this knowing that there's going to be some kind of twist ending, and the one in this delivers the goods.Grade: A-",The Invitation
7,morrison-dylan-fan,You are invited to...,6,14 May 2016,"For the last weeks I've been in the mood of watching a (non romantic or comedic) indie movie,but have been struggling to decide on what to watch.Taking a look on IMDb's Classic Film board,I noticed a discussion going on about a creepy indie title,which led to me opening up the invitation.The plot:Driving to a dinner party with his girlfriend Kira,Will runs over a coyote.Finding it still alive from the hit,Will kills the coyote.Arriving at the dinner,Will and Kira meet David and Will's ex-wife Eden (who left Will after they struggled with the death of their son Ty.) Joined by David & Eden's friends Tommy, Miguel,Ben,Claire and Gina,the gang start to get to know each other,Arriving late,David and Eden's friend Pruitt.As Will remembers spending time with Ty in the house,Eden and David gathering everyone up to play a party game.During the party game,Eden and David reveal that they have joined a group called ""The Invitation"",whose activities include taking peoples last breaths.View on the film:Offering a (false) voice of reason, John Carroll Lynch gives a great performance as Pruitt,whose casual manner Lynch uses to hide a brutal force.Sliding around the house, Tammy Blanchard does very well at breaking the glamour in the façade that Eden protects herself with.Whilst his thick beard is carried with a world-weary sigh on his worn-down face, Logan Marshall-Green fails to fully express the grief on Will's shoulders,with Will's outbursts being hit with a short burst from Green,instead of a lingering,bubbling mood which would have given Will more psychological depth.Set mainly in Eden and David's house,director Karyn Kusama & cinematographer Bobby Shore glaze the title in light amber's which sink the film in a false calming atmosphere which is broken by the bursts of dry blood.Putting everyone round the table,the screenplay by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi passes plates of absurdist chills and dark indie Drama round the table.Although the writers set out the table nicely with death cults and glimpses into a tragic pasts,everything is kept on a separate plate,with the writers blocking the characters from the entwining growth and simmering unease that they each appear to offer,as they all start to regret their invites with death.",The Invitation
8,trashgang,extreme slow moving thriller,6,28 December 2016,"Not being a horror at all more a thriller, that's what I found after watching The Invitation. Maybe for some it do has a creepy atmosphere but to be honest, it's a slow moving flick that turns from a great party into a complete disaster.There aren't any effects at all, and it's all talking and talking and situation after situation. But somehow I kept watching to see what is going on between the people attending the party. Was it my cup of tea? Not really due the fact that it's all about talking but it isn't that bad after all, mixed emotions. Not for people who are out to see action or a nice bloody horror flick but for people who attend confused stories and are into psychology.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 0/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",The Invitation
9,deloudelouvain,"Only the end is okay, the rest is below average",5,28 April 2016,"I have to admit I am disappointed by this movie. I saw it had a high rating and I read some reviews about how good it was supposed to be. But in fact it's not that great. It could have been so much better if they would not have dragged that whole story. By that I mean the only last half hour could be qualified as good. The rest of the movie is a battle to not fall asleep, with unstoppable irritating conversations between a bunch of weirdo's. If it was not for the end, that you see coming from miles away by the way, then I would have scored the movie even lesser. The actors are not bad, they are just average.

10,christopher-underwood,An absolute sensation,10,25 February 2021,"An absolute sensation. I was gripped from the start and captivated throughout, intrigued and somewhat mesmerised as I struggled, like the main protagonist, to ascertain whether things really were as potentially terrible as it seemed they might be. And just when it would appear that he and I might be overreacting..... This is a most assured achievement with writers and director locked together and a tight cast in one house on a small budget, completely focused on what is going on and at the same time making sure the viewer is made to constantly adjust and readjust their sense of reality. I thought of the horrors of Charles Manson and oddly Who'se Afraid of Virginia Woolf as I gradually began to grasp the full horror being played out here.

11,namashi_1,Absorbing!,7,5 May 2016,"Karyn Kusama's 'The Invitation' is an Absorbing, Slow-Building Horror-Thriller, that springs a surprise. It may not be ""conventional"" in terms of its narrative's pacing, but its a rewarding experience, as this one chills & thrills.'The Invitation' Synopsis: While attending a dinner party at his former home, a man thinks his ex-wife and her new husband have sinister intentions for their guests.'The Invitation' is a disturbing story, about a man haunted by his past. What makes it worse for the protagonist, is also his present, when he realizes there is something very wrong happening at a dinner party, with close people around. This is a twisted story, that takes its own time to come the actual crux of the story, but it remains absorbing. The resolution, is definitely shocking & the climatic portions are surely nail-biting. Phil Hay & Matt Manfred's Screenplay is first-rate. Although, despite all the goods, I do wish the Writing was a bit more crisper. Nonetheless, the Writing is superior. Karyn Kusama's Direction is superb. She nicely treats the eerie narrative & maintains the mood throughout. Bobby Shore's Cinematography creates the claustrophobic mood, perfectly. Editing is sharp. Art & Costume Design are good. Background Score is mention-worthy.Performance-Wise: Logan Marshall-Green leads the show. As the protagonist stuck in nightmares & in one himself, he's Excellent. Tammy Blanchard is top-notch, while John Carroll Lynch is creepy to the core. The Supporting Actors, all of them, are tremendous as well. On the whole, 'The Invitation' deserves a watch.",The Invitation
12,Red-Barracuda,Slow burning thriller with some interesting ideas,7,25 October 2016,"A man and his girlfriend are invited to a dinner party hosted by his ex-wife at her plush house in the Hollywood Hills. Ghosts from the past intertwine with an uneasiness born of the present to create the feeling that something is badly wrong.The Invitation is one of those films that feels ready made for the term 'slow burner'. In it we enter a scenario where there is a very gradual and deliberate build-up of tension which ultimately leads to a tense and vicarious finale. It's mostly build-up here in fairness, with the focus of the story on a very uneasy gathering of people where something always feels somewhat off-kilter. The drama is complicated by the fact that the male protagonist is still suffering from unresolved grief pertaining to the death of his child when he was still with his ex-wife. Its left fairly ambiguous as to what actually happened but it seems to have been a terrible accident of some sort. The other thread of the story ultimately leads to the realisation that the ex-wife and her new partner are now part of a strange cult which has deadly intentions. There may be some religious analogy to all this seeing as the main character is decidedly Christ-like, his grounded girlfriend is called Eden, there are thirteen guests at this dinner in the same way that there were thirteen disciples at the last supper and the taking of wine is an integral part of the ritual. Mixed into this is an unmistakable parallel to the Manson family murders too, with the setting for its carnage being a large plush house in the L.A. hills full of unwitting party guests, a slightly Manson-like leader and committed cult follower in the form of a very strange girl called Sadie who surely is a reference to the real Manson family member Sadie Mae Glutz (aka Sexy Sadie, aka Susan Atkins), who in real life had more than a passing resemblance to the psychologically troubled character in this film.This was a good film but not really a great one. I think the main issue might have been that it was made plain from the start that something was most definitely up with this gathering. So the revelations later on merely confirm suspicions rather than take us by surprise and consequently have less impact than they might have. But despite this, it's still done well with some subtly sinister moments making an impression such as when one of the party guests leaves the house and we are left wondering if something dreadful has happened to her. The latter moment is achieved by our uncertainty being exploited and it is a pretty original way of approaching what would otherwise be a typical thriller scene. So, it is ultimately some of these more unusual decisions and ideas that keep this one interesting. Its material could probably have still been presented better in some ways but, in the final analysis, this is a thriller that remains pretty interesting on the whole.",The Invitation
13,disdressed12,the wheels on the bus go round and round....,3,15 August 2016,"well.that was different.this thing moves very ponderously.and it felt too talky and preachy for my tastes. nothing of any import happens for almost the entire film.i'm not sure how to categorize it.i wouldn't call it a thriller,because it isn't thrilling.i guess it was a drama,but it wasn't compelling to me.i was hoping for something profound to happen.but no luck.and then,the ending to me,it was a cop out and nothing really special .i didn't really see the point of it all.and maybe that's just me.the current rating for this movie is 6.6 on this site.that's more than a bit generous ,in my opinion.it's entirely possible I am out to lunch and there is actually a good movie somewhere here,but I didn't see it.i will say I liked the orchestral score.it was the best part of the film.overall,though nothing to write home about.for me THe Invitation is a 3/10",The Invitation
14,KineticSeoul,A cult horror flick,6,28 June 2016,"This is a eerie movie revolving around a dinner party. Except this dinner party is with guest that have past scars and trauma they are dealing with. The people that invited the guest claims that it's a place of healing and trying to relieve the pain they are dealing with. Now despite the low budget I thought the cinematography was alright. It even had two actors I recognized. One being that one bald actor that either plays the awkward guy in the group or the complete jerk. And that second guy to play Daenerys bodyguard in ""Game of Thrones"". So yeah, when it comes down to it this is a cult horror movie but it doesn't depend on taking it to the extreme. Or having gruesome violent scenes to engage the audiences. Instead it takes a more subtle approach by showing bits and pieces of how some people in the house just might be unstable in the head. Overall this is a okay watch, it's main drive is more on picking up bits and pieces of the strange things that are going on over the crazy violence and scare factor.6/10",The Invitation
15,thesar-2,Invitation: Accepted,8,9 April 2016,"Going in completely cold to a movie is a highlight of my movie fetish. When I saw just a quick poster of The Invitation attached to a 4/4 star review of a professional movie critic friend of mine online, my interest peaked. Then, others followed with either anticipation or having seen it and praising it, as well. I stopped there.I was already hooked, and while it was a must-see, I didn't want to know any more. Especially when one of the commenters instructed us NOT to see the trailer. (This is an easy one for me; I hate trailers. They simply ruin too much for me, whether intentionally or not.)This movie was worth the wait. Oh, sorry, those posts were from a week or more ago. I truly liked it a ton. For such an independent/basically one location film, it was incredibly shot, crafted and had true acting from people you may or may not have ever heard from before. (I think I recognized one person, and while he was good, the rest blew me away on how I believed each of them.)While I encourage you to go in cold as I did, once you begin, you'll have an urge to put the pieces together from past movie experiences. That's natural and while the film tosses you around a lot, I was more enamored by the performances, mood, dialogue, tension and freshness to modern cinema. Typically I provide even a snippet of a synopsis, but I'm not going to be a hypocrite this time. Take my word for it: See it and see it cold. Let their world, words, direction and pacing enthrall you to the perfect conclusion.Most likely I will be thinking about this movie a ton and recommending it to anyone I speak with about movies, especially those who appreciate film. I am pleased I listened to my friends and accepted the invitation.***Final thoughts: Thanks, Dustin. I know we don't always agree, but the second I saw your post about this, and your stars/teaser first line of your review, I knew I *had* to see it.",The Invitation

17,Edvis-1997,5,5,21 November 2018,I found it very average and boring movie. Literally nothing special.,The Invitation
18,Pjtaylor-96-138044,RSVP.,8,27 November 2019,"'The Invitation (2015)' works as a kind of reverse home-invasion thriller, with its lead being invited to an inadvertently painful reunion with his ex-wife and former friends in a luxury 'house in the hills'. The tension that subsequently ratchets isn't so much life-threatening as socially awkward, although there's always an undeniably enigmatic and, even, unsettling vibe. This is mainly due to the movie's excellent sense of tone and atmosphere, which brilliantly puts us in the perpetually perturbed protagonist's always-on-edge mindset. The piece takes care to make sure we aren't certain of its true nature, managing to twist our expectations just enough for the affair to be, ultimately, rather unpredictable. The explosive finale does a great job of delivering on the unspoken promise of the long build-up that precedes it, even if it may be slightly more generic than the affair actually deserves. Even then, the flick does a fantastic job of feeling fresh, keeping you on your toes even as it treads into well-worn territory. It has a cracking set of characters, most of whom get just enough time to be individually empathetic, and a great dynamic between them, which often smoothly alternates from friendly and warm to strained and suspicious. By the time the previously mentioned finish arrives, you aren't quite sure whose side to be on. This is especially invigorating when you consider that it's something most pictures patently fail to do. It's all very engaging and equally as enjoyable. It's a great, well-rounded piece with some rough-around-the-edges but compelling performances and a sharply slow-burning story. 8/10.",The Invitation
19,ThomasDrufke,Never Feel Safe,9,20 October 2018,"If there's one thing I can always appreciate is reinventing genre in movies. Maybe The Invitation isn't technically reinventing Horror completely, but it's no doubt a unique take on a genre that is always lacking originality. My type of horror is either the one that takes its time or the one that creates a creepy atmosphere with a psychological background to it. One could say that The Invitation does all of those things and more. It's not necessarily the most talented or well-known cast, but each of them do right by their roles and are fantastic individually. But the real standout is the direction from Karyn Kusama. Always keeping me on the edge of my seat and executing a third act so radical and expecting that my jaw slowly started to drop towards the floor. The music is great as well, which contributed to that tension throughout. There's also a lot more than just surface character stuff, the theme of grief is powerfully present throughout the film and I was extremely impressed by where that story goes and how it's ultimately handled. This is a phenomenal horror/thriller.9.0/10",The Invitation

Besides the overused and drawn out opening scenes often found in cheap movies of a car driving on a long stretch of road was the pointless early scene of hitting a coyote most likely meant as allegory for the story's denouement. Acting was as robotic as it gets, but part of the blame belongs to the script and set which was basically contained within a few rooms of a house. The dialogue was boringly predictable laden with obscenities spiced with alcohol and with no purpose other than to give emotional impact to a pervasively dull plot. A plot centered about a stereotypic party reunion of acquaintances past and present gathered to meet, duh - the predictable messy ending. So tedious and lacking in creative intelligence was this rehash I found relief in frequent use of ff.",The Invitation
21,Reno-Rangan,Think carefully before attending your ex's party invite!,6,14 October 2016,"My first impression was, not another 'The Perfect Host'. And it is not, but the same category. This is a comeback film for the director after the average 'Jennifer's Body' that released half a decade ago. Some people liked it, but for me it was an average film, because I've seen the better one. Still, I appreciate the effort, like handling the narration. You know these days viewers are bit clever, they begin to predict from the early stage, so this story quite interestingly upheld the suspense.Till the final act it keeps developing, not the story or the characters wisely, but the event where the plot evolves. A at a same time it leaves behind some clues about what might come later. That part is very confusing, I did not know what to believe and what not. Because I don't want to be a fool when twist happens. This was a lot dramatised and when the crucial event comes into play, the pace increased. The first 80 per cent of the film was what I enjoyed, but the twist ruined my party and then the final scene was so smart. The best way to conclude for such a thriller.There are none tense moments, except in the final segment, but the curiosity of the event's states gets higher like particularly everybody is waiting for the twist to come. That's where some people would be disappointed. If you are not expecting too much, you would enjoy the remaining part as well. There's nothing to praise about the actors, all were just good. The script should have been a bit smarter in some parts. For one time watch it will do fine, that's what I favour.6/10",The Invitation
22,sol-,Dine In,7,23 October 2016,"Invited to a dinner party by his estranged ex-wife and her new husband, a Californian man becomes increasingly unsettled with how calm and positive his hosts seem in this independent thriller that is best entered into with as few expectations as possible. There are some twists and turns to come, all of which leads to a memorable final outdoor scene, but it is the very nature of the plot that resonates the most afterwards. The main character is, after all, unsettled by how warm, inviting and happy his hosts seem, however, should this really be such a strange thing? Is it not better that they smile all the time rather than frown all the time? Further food for thought comes as his ex-wife relegates all human emotion down to chemical reactions, and as the film moves along, we gradually learn more and more about how their relationship became fractured in the first place. Intriguing as all this may sound, the film ultimately offers very little variation on the typical paranoia thriller in which we are unsure whether or not the protagonist is insightful or simply losing his mind, and the slow build-up is not really justified by the grisly yet hardly spectacular turn the film takes in its final half-hour. The ending, memorable as it may be, also leaves a few too many questions open for its own good. Whatever issues one may have with the film, the tension and sense of unease that it carries throughout is hard to shake and the film boasts some great performances. Particularly remarkable is John Carroll Lynch (of 'Zodiac' fame) as an unexpected guest who drops by midway into the film.",The Invitation
23,eddie_baggins,A dinner invite you can skip,4,31 May 2016,"A grim slow burning thriller cume horror that never activates the fear button like it could've so easily done, Karyn Kusama's The Invitation is a film that's mildly curious for its first 15 – 20 minutes but finds itself drawn into an increasingly slow paced mid-section before a fairly bloodthirsty finale tries to make all the hard yards worth the viewer's efforts to lacking results.The Invitation does often threaten to become a finely tuned mixing of thrills, chills and dealing with loss but Kusama can't string the right balance between the facets together and while the cast features somewhat noteworthy faces in the form of Logan Marshall-Green's grieving Will and Tammy Blanchard's newly minted cult member Eden, the film can't find a performer that takes the material by the scruff of the neck and run away with the whole thing even though recognisable character actor John Carroll Lynch (remember, that creepy guy from Zodiac) has a fair bit of fun with his seedy Pruitt, a dinner guest you definitely don't want to see on arrival! It was always going to be a major hurdle for the film with so-so performances and unlikeable characters, as the films slow burn nature means we the viewer are virtually locked away in Eden and her partner David's off putting hill top mansion for the films runtime and while brief moments will shock and make you stand to attention, a large portion of The Invitation's scenes drag out unnecessarily and fail to connect in the ways they were intended to do.Where The Invitation finds some wins is in its initial set up which bleeds ominous dread and terror and while it escalates into something far too silly to be taken seriously the films crescendo of carnage and out right battle for survival certainly makes an impression even if it's too little too late to truly rectify the wrong steps the film has already taken previous to its unleashing.Far better in theory than execution, The Invitation showcases small glimmers of a standout horror/thriller hybrid but can't ever get itself into a genuine run at becoming what it promised to be. A solid idea squandered around mediocre characters and uninteresting portrayals, The Invitation is certainly a dinner evening you don't need to RSVP for.2 coyotes out of 5",The Invitation

It is irrefutably the most difficult emotion to overcome, and can overwhelm the strongest of personalities. Kusama's thrilling episode of 'Come Dine With Me' gradually explores the weight of life itself, simply by allowing a group of long-time friends the chance to discuss such a topic. Yet, what enables Kusama's slow-burn thriller to elevate itself into the top echelon of effective profoundness, is its simplicity.There are no extravagant plot devices. No sublimely utilised twists. And certainly no misplaced character conveniences. By equipping grief and depression as a manifestation of the narrative, Kusama was able to demonstrate her incredibly astute direction through natural plausibilities. Will, portrayed accurately and captivatingly by Marshall-Green, exhumed indications of paranoia. A heightened consequence of his raging anguish. Constantly questioning the actions of other characters, such as locked doors, barred windows and unknown guests, he assumes the role of the audience's perception. We, as the viewer, examine and query each character reveal and emotional complexity simultaneously to Will's interrogative persona. He, essentially, is us. Instantly allowing viewers to relate to him in this unusual circumstance.Something is not right with this dinner party. He feels it. We feel it. But his instincts are muted by the other guests, naturally due to his heightened state of sorrow, in order to maintain a civilised appearance. That, right there, is the representation of depression. Forced to hide what we really are enduring, with despondent thoughts circling our synapses. It's abundantly intelligent on Kusama's part, who elevated the screenplay to the stratosphere of uneasy, anxiety-inducing storytelling. With the assistance of Shore's cinematography, constantly blurring the outskirts and backgrounds of frames to enhance personable abandonment and solitude, Kusama hosted one of the most engaging dinner parties I've ever attended. Inviting a naturally diverse cast of actors, ranging from different ethnicities to sexual orientation, who inhibit their own character qualities.An array of components culminating in a third act that switches from first gear to a gear with incalculable speeds. The wine was served, my heart rate increased. I required a towel, I was sweating that much from anxiety. Ignoring the last minute of the feature, which was an eye-rolling moment to say the least, a slow-burn thriller such as this utilises a substantial amount of foreshadowing as its narrative device. Unfortunately, it is inescapable. However, Hay and Manfredi do their utmost best to keep the conversation flowing during times of prognostication. Shapiro's score is also worth mentioning for its sharp string-based chords that increase the chance of sweaty palms.The Invitation, from the offset, is an incredibly simple thriller. Games are played, wine is served and a few arguments are bound to occur. However, if you cut through Kusama's simplistic exterior, you'll find an extraordinarily intelligent dinner party that evokes a powerful emotional connection. Just, y'know, think twice before accepting an invitation...",The Invitation

I was excited to watch this after reading some good reviews. I totally regret watching this film and wasting my time. It is simply very very slow, boring and predictable. They spend so much time building up the movie, and nothing happens. Even the cinematography, some decent acting n one redeeming twist at the end cannot compensate for this senseless film. Zero tension n zero thrill. Well it was about some cult. At least they could hav added some titillating erotism, nudity/sex. But nothing. They wasted the character of Lindsay burdge. This film was more like a cult giving discourse in life, death, emotions n to let go. *uck man, too boring.

27,jtindahouse,Element of mystery makes for a fine thriller,9,13 April 2016,"I recently watched '10 Cloverfield Lane' and was completely taken off guard at how much I enjoyed it. I went in expecting a standard horror movie and was instead treated to an excellent mystery/thriller that had me guessing until the very end. 'The Invitation' was almost exactly the same experience for me. I went in expecting clichés galore, predictability left right and centre and a bland story that I would forget the moment the credits rolled. Instead I found myself enthralled. Is an element of mystery becoming stock standard in horror/thrillers these days? I certainly hope so. The story is a little slow and could potentially try your patience if you're not in the right frame of mind for it, however I would implore you to stick with it. The person I was watching it with didn't like it and left early, then later when I explained to her what had happened in the second half she was disappointed she had left so early. It's a cast of mostly unknowns so the acting can be a little shaky at times but not to the extent that it ever ruins the experience. All in all this is an above average film that will be very enjoyable to everyone who gives it a chance.",The Invitation
28,parry_na,Compelling and stylish.,7,2 October 2020,"Initially, this film reminded me of a modern version of 1932's 'The Old Dark House', in which a group of strangers meet up and navigate their way through an awkward evening, where every word and sentiment is laced with some cryptic double-meaning, before events take on a more horrific note.Here, we meet Will (Logan Marshall-Green), someone so determinedly uncomfortable, it seems there aren't enough egg-shells in the room to walk on around him. When we (and his outstandingly loyal girlfriend Kira, played by Emayatzy Corinealdi ) meet his group of friends (and his ex-wife Eden, played by Tammy Blanchard) who have organized the reunion in which the story takes place, we feel he has every reason to be so tense.As is often the case, I enjoyed the 'journey' more than the 'destination'.

I still don't know why the first scene played out like it did. It still doesn't seem relevant and the title sequence is too elaborate and often the many flashbacks are just plain confusing.But for a narrative that plays out with such limited time and setting, there is a never moment that isn't charged with emotional baggage as characters with history try to move forward when the past is trying to pull them back.It's not just another interpersonal drama, but to simply call it a thriller would also be misleading. A movie with potentially many layers of nuance and character but even on its most obvious level plays as a fiercely compelling mystery with a great main character and a lot of very uncomfortable moments that ebb and flow masterfully.",The Invitation

31,drownnnsoda,"Utterly soulless ""thriller""",2,20 October 2019,"""The Invitation"" follows a man and his girlfriend who, for some reason, accept an invitation by his ex-wife for a dinner party with her new boyfriend, at the house where their son died. Things are weird, and get weirder... I guess.The rave reviews for this film are truly baffling, as it was one of the most soulless, dull films I've had the misfortune of sitting through in recent memory. Director Karyn Kusama was mildly effective with the tongue-in-cheek horror comedy ""Jennifer's Body,"" but fails on all fronts with the more straight-laced, serious material. There is no sense of fear, no sense of unease, and no sense of threat--all because none of these people feel real or can be identified with.The film's cardinal sin is that its writing is trite and utterly artificial-feeling; none of the characters ring true, none of the circumstances or interpersonal dynamics feel genuine, and none of the actors are strong enough to even slightly invigorate the anemic writing. In a film that is as slow-burn in approach as this is, the writing needs to be top-notch, but it is abjectly bad. The modes in which characters speak are laughable, and attempts to highlight ""awkward social navigation"" moments fall flat on their faces. The performances overall are only slightly above that of a high school drama production, though it's difficult to tell where it is the fault of the performers and where it is the fault of the abysmal dialogue.While there are a couple of creepy moments peppered in, the film is a failure as a thriller, and not any better as a drama, nor a horror film. It does ramp up slightly in the last 20-30 minutes, but by that point, it's difficult to care what happens to these facsimiles of characters. ""The Invitation"" is soulless, trite, and devoid of any semblance of humanity. Truly one of the worst films I've seen in recent memory.",The Invitation

34,TdSmth5,Unique and interesting but slow,6,12 December 2016,"A couple is invited to a gathering at the LA mansion of the guy's ex. On the way there they run over a coyote and the guy (Will) has to execute it. Once they get there, things are weird. He and his ex Eden haven't seen each other in years. The new guy in her life David (can't have a movie without a character named David) seems pleasant enough trying to get everyone to get along. Also there are a bunch of mutual friends, a wacky girl who is living with Eden and Dave now, and a friend of Dave's named Pruitt, missing is a guy named Choi who is always late.From the get-go Will is exceedingly suspicious, everything Dave does or doesn't do is scrutinized by Will. He's outraged for instance that Dave will keep the doors locked. Eden is very nice but her behavior is a little off. There's talk about suffering and trauma and some flashbacks. It takes a while for the movie to let us know that Will and Eden's son was killed by accident during a party by a friend. Eden seems to be over it, which Will finds reprehensible. We learn that Eden and Dave spent some time in Mexico with some group. Out comes the laptop with the promotional video of the group which calls itself The Invitation. The ""promotional"" video consists of the leader and a woman watching another woman die. The leader talks about communion and freedom from pain and suffering. This is followed by a speech from Pruitt about how he accidentally killed his wife, went to jail, but know he's at peace. All of that freaks out one of the guests and she leaves after they start playing some game where the participants express their desire--it quickly turns raunchy.Will finds some tranquilizers in Eden's room, he worries about this stranger Pruitt. The wacky girl comes on to him in a rather weird way. When he hears a message from Choi who got there early but isn't there, he flips out and accuses Dave and Eden of something, he does not know what. Then Choi arrives. Will ends up looking like a nut.After Will is forgiven by the overly generous Dave and Eden, they have one more drink. That's when things unravel--20 minutes before the movie ends. Now things get interesting and violent. There's an expected twist and the movie ends with another little surprise.The Invitation is a unique movie. It's set in a mansion in LA with fancy Angelenos--the interracial couple (finally made up of a white male and a black girl not the other way around which is what Hollywood always insists on showing,) the gay couple, the wacky free spirit, and some type of creepy spiritual cult. I appreciate that finally someone set a horror thriller in the extreme coasts and among the upper class as opposed to in red states, which is getting tiring. There's a lot to like about this movie, but it also could have been a better movie had they trimmed it by about 15 minutes. Will is exaggeratedly suspicious. He isn't interested in the least about having a good time. Sure, he's supposed to be traumatized while the group's members are free. But still, from the second he gets there the tone is far too ominous. The music and the slow pace try to maintain the tension but they can't. Eventually you lose a bit of interest because until the last 20 minutes just not a whole lot goes on. The philosophical bits about grief, pain, and suffering were interesting. Despite its weaknesses, The Invitation does leave a favorable impression.",The Invitation

36,Matt_Layden,"""You're Invited""",6,3 January 2017,"What would you do when your friends invite you over to their house and things start to get really weird, almost uncomfortably unsafe weird. You get the hell out right? Despite the one characters constant questioning of events that take place here, he doesn't seem interested in leaving the party. If he does, we don't have a film anymore. So putting aside logic and accepting that only one person decides to leave this party, is The Invitation thrilling enough to warrant a recommended watch?Will takes his new girlfriend to his ex-wife's house for a dinner party. All their friends are there, friends they haven't seen in awhile. Things between Will and his ex-wife is a little strained due to an emotional loss in their past, but everyone decides to look past it in order to have a good time. Throughout the night, Will suspects that his ex-wife and her new husband have other motives for bringing everyone together. Are there other motives? Or is Will just crazy? The film lets the questionable actions of the hosts walk a fine line to make you lean either way. The hosts invite another guest that their friends do not know. This is someone they met in a grief group known as The Invitation. This guy seems a little off, but is pleasant enough on the outside to not really question anything. It's not until he gives a speech about his wife do people really feel uncomfortable and question if they should stay. The Invitation does a decent job of keeping an awkward level of suspense within the house, even if you are questioning character actions. A key element to this film is the opening sequence when Will and his new girlfriend hit a coyote with their car on their way to the party. The coyote is injured and it's up to Will to put the creature out of its misery. That act is the core theme to the entire film. The film asks us these questions throughout. The film's third act kicks things into high gear and the subtly of the suspense in thrown out the window for a more in your face approach. The entire film builds to this confrontation and it works for the most part. I can't help by feel that the one and only memorable things about this film though is the final shot. Which is a great shot that almost feels Hitchcockian. This single location thriller is effective enough for fans of the genre to enjoy and people looking for a good thriller won't mind it either.",The Invitation
37,begob,California Screaming,6,1 May 2016,"A couple accept an invite to a reunion of old friends with a troubled past, and find an unwelcome solution is planned for them.Interesting movie, but the concept is hazy. The music sets an edgy tone, and the photography and actors maintain the discomfort throughout, but I was expecting something less literal, more spooky. The final scene does add an element of the uncanny, but it doesn't really illuminate what went before. My ears pricked up with the speech about grief and pain being just a chemical problem, but that wasn't explored even though it's a practical approach that might blow spirituality out of the water.One big problem is too many characters with no convincing reason to be there. Disappointed that the girlfriend wasn't a pivotal character. And once you realise how plain the plot is, you're left with the expectation of a standard shoot out. I would have turned the memory of the boy into a vengeful ghost, only for it to have a part in the final resolution - nothing over the top, just enough to mask the real threat and fill up the space from paring away a few of the unnecessary characters.The vibe is tres California, with a bunch of privileged sensitives assuming they represent all of human experience - but I like that, and the hippiness is a nice throwback. Maybe they should gift their wealth away and go get jobs that matter. There's a real solution.Overall - intrigues but does not satisfy.",The Invitation

39,quincytheodore,Cripplingly eerie dinner with friends and strangers.,7,11 April 2016,"""The Invitation"" makes use of a long social gathering with all of its awkward tendencies and double the agonizing pain with eerie talk of propaganda and secret past. This presentation might be slow, but it's certainly effective in creating tension as questionable strangers pop up in a seemingly inescapable and increasingly uneasy soirée.Story follows a group of people invited by Eden (Tammy Blanchard), who was missing for a while and now returns with new company altogether, including a spouse. Will (Logan Marshall-Green) had a particularly dark past with Eden and as the night goes on it becomes clear that something is amiss in the luxurious house he once lived in.Tammy Blanchard plays the troubled female lead impeccably, she appears to be normal yet there's a jarring feeling that she fakes the whole thing. Also, there are occasional ticks, both subtle and straight up outbursts that trigger suspicion. The other guests are just like ordinary people with their odd behaviors and imposing gestures, so it creates a guessing game throughout the night to determine who has the few screws loose.It gets even more surreal when Eden brings an entourage of dubious people, some even blatantly voice their oddities. The movie progresses with anticipation whether this dinner party will turn into Hannibal movie or these people are just normally strange. The tension rises along with revelations from the past, although this aspect can feel a bit dragging at times.For a nice less-than-relaxing times, bizarre propaganda and partially threatening companies, ""The Invitation"" is readily acceptable.",The Invitation
40,tomsview,With friends like these,7,4 November 2017,"Although I didn't feel this movie made all that much sense as I watched it, I haven't stopped thinking about it since. It made an impression.The best horror films often don't have a supernatural explanation. They are stories that can't be dismissed as implausible. ""Psycho"" is the classic, but films such as ""Wolf Creek"", ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Prisoners"" and ""Irreversible"" are horrific and deeply disturbing, but without the supernatural safety net that allows us to feel it just couldn't happen. Interestingly, there is a scene in ""The Invitation"" that pays no small homage to a scene in ""Irreversible"".Will (Logan Marshall-Green) accepts an invitation to a dinner party with his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard), and her new husband, David (Michiel Huisman). He is taking along his new girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi). There are other guests at the party, some Will has met before and others he hasn't. We only get to know the characters by their first names: Will, Kira, Eden, David, Ben, Gina, Miguel, Tommy, Sadie, Choi, and the rather out of place, big older guy, Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch).As often happens when alcohol starts to loosen everyone up, the conversation gets onto subjects best left alone. In this case the subject of death and grieving becomes a real party killer.Without spoiling things too much because there are surprises here, Will has an uneasy feeling that everything is not right about this gathering. As we learn more of his backstory, we suspect he may be right.""The Invitation"" takes a while to get going and in the dimly lit house it isn't always easy to work out who is doing what to whom. The fact that Will and David both have beards doesn't add to the clarity. However ""The Invitation"" has a disturbing mood. The ending reminded me of the ending of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" where there was no easy answer and we are left wondering.""The Invitation"" wasn't what I was expecting; it's one that stayed with me.",The Invitation
41,arungeorge13,Review - The Invitation (2015),6,6 June 2017,"'The Invitation' holds good for most part thanks to some great performances, crafty direction by Karyn Kusama (Aeonflux, Jennifer's Body, Girlfight) and effective screenplay & dialogues by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (who have co-written strictly mediocre films such as The Tuxedo, Clash of the Titans and RIPD).Logan Marshall Green is terrific as Will, and he sort-of exudes that Tom Hardy-esque persona at times. The rest of the cast pitch in with above-par performances as well.It begins like this. Will and his new girlfriend Kira get invited to his old house where his ex-wife Eden and her new husband David are holding a re-union dinner party for their friends. It is implied that Will and Eden lost their son Ty and they divorced soon after. Apparently, Eden met David at a grief support camp. So, the stage is set for an evening of wine and merry-making by the couple who have been off the grid for nearly two years.Will spends a good portion of the evening keeping to himself and recollecting some of the events that took place in his life. Some of those sad memories such as Eden trying to attempt suicide keep bouncing off his head. We are told that one of the characters (Choi) is yet to make it to the party. As the night progresses, Eden and David tell the group about how they have recovered from grief, and found positivity by being part of the cult in Mexico. Things start looking increasingly interesting and the tensive build-up is executed amazingly well. The dialogues appear on-point and hit the mark pretty good.We do get the feeling that something is amiss with the newly- reformed Eden, David and his friend Pruitt. The semi-nude entry of Sadie itself seals the deal with respect to this fact. But everything kinda goes well for a good part of the evening where Will seemingly tries to reconnect with all that has passed. The thrills are deftly placed, and the performances almost perfectly complement the writing and direction. When Will receives a message from Choi stating he had already reached before everyone else but seems M.I.A, the suspicion starts to reach saturation point. The viewer is ready to embrace ""break-point"". Hey, we are at the 75 minute mark here. So that's enough hype. Time for some gory action.The ""break-point"" however arrives a little later than expected, but at a very crucial juncture. I expected a 'Youre Next' sortof 20 minutes to follow, but the pacing never elevates. This is where one feels the writing could have been improved. It lacks those edge-of- the-seat moments that we look for, in thrillers such as these. Slowly yet steadily, we come to the finale which is rather unsurprising too. Fatalities involve good guys and bad guys. The closing shot (that of the burning lanterns) was a redeemer of sorts though.Kusama and her writers needed to put in a little more elucidation as to why the couple and Pruitt waited for so long to commence 'Operation: Murder', given the fact that most of the executions were simply by way of gunshots or straight-forward knife stabs in the end. Ostensibly, it was all part of a cult ritual but COME ON! Why isn't the viewer educated about this? They could have used that Will-Sadie scene by the pool to give clearer hints. Okay, maybe the climax and pre-climax portions do possess a realistic touch compared to other home- invasion thrillers and succeed, to an extent, in maintaining a decent level of ambiguity; nevertheless it brought to a standstill all that bustling excitement which the makers took so long to construct. Them mind- games never really paid off.But hey, hats off to Kusama and crew for concocting an intense and taut psychological thriller that raised the bar in terms of build- up. If only the final bits were charted out better..SIGH!",The Invitation

Even the initial scenario of attending a dinner party with your ex and their new partner after years without contact is far-fetched.But even if you can let that go, it's not long until things really do start to get silly. The main characters are rightly suspicious of their guests from the start but, even as things in the house and the behaviour of the hosts starts to creep them out, they decide to stay anyway. Of course, there would be no film if they didn't, but it's all very predictable and unrealistic.I can never fully invest in mystery/thriller like this if the story doesn't seem plausible, or if the characters act in a way that nobody would in real life.

48,eminkl,Here's to hoping that we'll all spend the rest of our lives never having to go to a dinner party as much a nightmare as the one depicted,7,13 December 2019,"Between viewings of ""Clue"" and ""You're Next"" have I found that I much prefer watching dinner parties from hell than experiencing them firsthand. Granted, all I've had to sit through are a couple of awkward conversations at worst - I should consider myself lucky that I've never been quite literally trapped at a gathering nor stuck in the middle of a murderous scheme that involves me possibly getting offed. Karyn Kusama's sublimely slow burning ""The Invitation"" is no different in its subversive thrills than the aforementioned larks, though one would think that its characters would be slightly more apprehensive in their RSVPing considering the circumstances and the guest list. The film solely takes place (unless you count the cynical prologue) at a shindig at the home of Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and David (Michiel Huisman). The happy couple's been married for a few years now, but almost all their friends haven't seen them in two years - in store, as it's perceived, is an extensive reunion meant to take everyone back to what's distinguished as the ""good old days"". Things wouldn't be so immensely uncomfortable if not for the inviting of Will (Logan Marshall-Green), Eden's ex-husband. Having divorced due to the accidental death of their young son, tensions are underlined in a grief that makes the situation almost unbearable; from the moment this dinner party kicks off, the air is tinged in disconcertion so strong you'd maybe even be able to reach out and grab it if you tried hard enough. But it doesn't take long for it to become obvious that something else it at play within the posh walls of Eden and David's Hollywood Hills home. Have they perhaps invited their estranged friends over not to heal old wounds but to serve something more sinister than their guests realize? I'd better stop speculating over the details of the plot there for fear of spoiling too much - ""The Invitation's"" overture of thrills cascade over us so deliberately and so cautiously that to know too much in advance would potentially counteract the balancing act Kusama and her screenwriters, Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, so exquisitely execute. Unraveling with the suspenseful agony of a bandage being taken off a nasty gash after a month's worth of recovering, the film gets everything just about right, its conversations increasing in their edge with delectable precision, its performances always understatedly mounting in their anxiety (or, depending on who we're taking about, their rancorousness). And the gleaming unspooling of ""The Invitation"" is not an easy thing to pull off - on display is confident filmmaking only a veteran of Kusama's sort could achieve. One could say that it's a comeback for the filmmaker, who broke out with 2000's ""Girlfight"" but was sidelined with the failures of the critically panned ""Æon Flux"" (2005) and the undeservedly underrated ""Jennifer's Body"" (2009). It's one of the best independent films of the year: ""The Invitation"" is a (brutally dark) comedy of manners with Buñuel in its head and Polanski in its heart. With a deliciously twisted ending acting as the cinematic cherry on top to the succulent sum of its parts, ""The Invitation"" is horror with enough emotional tugs and enough categorical terror to stick with you as a minor masterpiece not to be reckoned with. Here's to hoping that we'll all spend the rest of our lives never having to go to a dinner party as much a nightmare as the one depicted.",The Invitation

50,spookyrat1,The Big Chill Literally!,8,23 October 2021,"Karyn Kusama's directorial output is uneven at times, but her independent feature The Invitation, sees her at the top of her game. She frequently tells stories of troubled individuals and The Invitation is no exception. It's pretty much an ensemble piece with 95% of the action confined to a swanky Hollywood Hills house and back yard, but don't let that worry you. The confined location ends up being both logical and crucial to the engrossing storyline.Logan Marshall Green plays Will who along with his new girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) travel somewhat uneasily to a dinner party in the Hollywood Hills hosted by his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new husband David (Michiel Huisman) in the house Will and Eden used to share. The catch - Will hasn't heard from Eden for over two years, his former flame disappearing suddenly after some unmentionable tragedy and their subsequent divorce. It turns out Eden and David met at a grief support group in Mexico and they wish to share their enthusiasm for the group at the dinner party, also attended by a gathering of mutual friends from the past, as well as a couple of fellow attendees from Mexico. Will still harbours guilt and regrets from the earlier tragedy and his disquiet and anxieties grow throughout the evening, as he gradually develops suspicions about the true nature of the reunion.Kusama displays an innate ability to generate tension in limited confines, building up Will's paranoia by frequently viewing the other guests and his dubious hosts from his viewpoint. Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi's tight script feeds us just enough information to create suspense while maintaining mystery. This movie is the definition of a slow - burn. But the denouement when it arrives, is both worth the wait and unforgettable, with the final scene looking out over the Hollywood Hills, simply a stunner.Technically the film is very professionally made, never reflecting the fact that it was made on a $1 million budget. All the cast is strong, with Marshall Green outstanding as the worried introvert Will, with his shaggy looks, I'm sure, deliberately designed to evoke images of Charles Manson and his cult - like gang, who committed a series of real life heinous murders in this vicinity in the late 1960's.The Invitation is a richly rewarding and very effective thriller for grown - ups, with an underlying premise strongly rooted (unfortunately) in every day modern life.

56,phenomynouss,Stressful,8,6 May 2018,"The way this film was billed on Netflix catalogue, and its placement in the ""Horror"" category, turned me off of it for the longest time, suspecting it would be something decidedly un-scary and slasher-y. Eventually, exhausting much of my other options over time, I came back to this and gave it a try.
Slow in the way it unfolds, it nevertheless goes beyond the initial ""social awkwardness of a reunion among adult friends after several years"", exacerbated by the suddenly disturbing revelation of Eden's newfound creepy cult-ish pseudoscience beliefs and her abruptly slapping one of the friends for calling it crazy.Backstory comes when it is needed, often in the form of flashbacks and condolences as we learn Will used to be married to Eden, until they lost their child. Now Will remains slightly remote, distant, perpetually staring and watching everyone else, as much on edge as me the viewer.
Restricting us to the point of view of the protagonist Will, we go through the night of a reunion house party where despite the unusual things that come up (a random guy played by John Carrol Lynch drops by, Eden and her new husband David show a cult-like promotional video depicting a woman dying of cancer on camera, a game of ""What I Want"" becomes overly intrusive, Eden's stash of phenobarbital is discovered, Sadie throws herself at Will and Gina), nothing happens which could be flat out labelled ""Not Normal"" and prompting a dropping of the masquerade of polite friendliness. Even a tense sequence where it seems that Will has ""caught"" Eden and David in some shenanigans is abruptly defused when a missing party attendant suddenly shows up.Rather than spoil any other aspect of the film as other reviews are liable to do or hint to, i'll just leave the review as it is now. This was a thoroughly stressful, intense experience remarkable for how little actually happens, leaving it entirely to our instincts to keep us perpetually on edge, partly out of nervous paranoia, partly out of expectation, since this is a movie. it makes me very glad I do not have many friends in real life",The Invitation
57,DareDevilKid,The Invitation Review: A Sinister Dinner Game that Would Make Hitchcock Proud,9,11 April 2016,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.6/5 stars""The Invitation"" makes brilliant use of its tense premise to deliver a highly effective and unexpectedly smart slow-burning thriller. The plot is quite simple really, but it's narrated with such a wicked eye and shrewd hand by Director Karyn Kusama that the tension seems all too real and always simmering just beneath the surface, waiting to burst out at any moment, eventually culminating to a jaw- dropping, sinister climax that's wholly rewarding after approximately 90 minutes of buildup.When Will shows up to his ex-wife, Eden, and her new husband, David's, dinner party, he begins to suspect their intentions and even goes to the extent of thinking that the couple have something ominous planned for their guests. In the house that was once his, the haunted Will becomes more and more convinced, with the signs surrounding him, that Eden, her new husband, and her new friends have a mysterious and terrifying agenda for Will and her old friends. But, with Will still coping from the tragic loss of his son – and Eden having moved on – his grip on reality and the validity of his doubts come into question. As the evening moves on, things only get murkier for the guests at the house as well as those seated in the theater.If the movie works as well as it does, it's because Kusama adeptly elicits suspense through shadows, silences, and ricocheting looks, and, almost nonchalantly, makes us question Will's and our own suspicions, only to pull the rug from beneath our feat when we least expect it. She ratchets up the tension masterfully, building to a finale that's as chilling as it's brilliant, helped in no small way by a effective cast that's wholly committed to her vision.However, along with being a little gem of a thriller, ""The Invitation"" also draws some of its mysterious aura from the emotional undercurrent of grief that acts as a major subplot as the suspense unfolds. Besides tantalizing us with wickedly clever plot devices, the movie also takes a fractured look into people desperate to change even if that means becoming different people all together. With this instant winner of an indie flick, Ms. Kusama has more than earned her place at Hollywood's elite table, and not inviting her to dinner would certainly make the affair less appetizing.",The Invitation
58,ridi-arahan,Life and death are phenomenon well when left uninterrupted,7,10 February 2021,"What worked:
I think the concept of the movie is cool and impressive. It's a well built psychological thriller with good essence put on main leads, bereaving the losses in their lives. The movie attempts to balance the movie between the real psychological trauma vs the perceived threat in the unconventional and doubtful social gathering. The movie gives hints of what's about to come but also plays it cool to keep the mood of the movie normally. Overall, it's an interesting watch and an engaging one.What did not work:
The mood of the movie is set different from what the final end product of the movie Intends to provide as a result fails to thrill majority of the movie and only revealing the actual thrills too late. I think it's a well intended project failing because the makers failed to set the tone of the movie. However, the movie works if there is no expectations regarding the thrills because it is a well versed drama with a one location setting.
Final verdict: recommended",The Invitation
59,danielmanson,Predictable.,3,15 January 2019,"As you can tell by the title, this film was just incredibly predictable from start to finish. I will start with what is good about this movie: It does keep you on edge, not sure who to trust etc therefore keeping that suspense (which is what you want with a thriller). Acting and cinematography was also pretty good.
But ultimately, it's just way too predictable. I guessed what the ending was going to be about 20 minutes into the film and BANG, that exact scenario happened (I don't want any spoilers so I won't state how it was obvious, but trust me, you will guess the ending quickly also).The reason why this annoyed me so much is, because there is very little happening in the film up until the final 15/20 minutes and like I said it was the exact ending I expected. So, to me, it just felt like an utter waste.Am I being harsh with 3 stars? Maybe. But, overall the predictability of it all was too annoying to get past. Like I said, there are positives to this film, but ultimately the negatives over haul them.",The Invitation

The mystery of Will and Eden's backstory is told perfectly through fleeting flashbacks and dream-like sequences through Will's memories. The weird behaviour never gets so weird that it's alarming until it's too late, and the idea that Will could just be overstating the situation are so legit that this movie could honestly have gone either way. And tying it all together with thematic bookends was just the cherry on the top. It's a slow burn like the best mystery thrillers are, approach it like that, without spoiling yourself, and you'll be set for an enthralling couple of hours. I give The Invitation a solid 8/10.",The Invitation
61,nitzanhavoc,"Different and impressive, profound acting by supporting cast!",7,6 June 2017,"Usually, I find it more difficult to fully connect to realistic Horror scenarios. Not to say I don't appreciate a good Slasher, Cat & Mouse or a well made Torture Porn with an actual story, plot and preferably a smart twist - but I always enjoy supernatural Horror and Ghost Stories more. Still, I believe one really needs to make a conscious effort in order to fail to recognize the relative greatness of The Invitation.The first thing that hits you is the conflicted music of the soundtrack, ominous yet relaxing, beautiful yet creepy and uneasy, and absolutely suitable to the overall ambiance of the film's occurrences. The music is only the first out of many things that cause and unnerving and uneasy sensation that ""nothing is wrong... yet"". I'm not sure which song this is in the detailed soundtrack, but whoever the composer - way to hit the nail right on the head!The story another feature to add to the uneasy feeling, as Will (Logan Marshall-Green) and his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) are on their way to a gathering of old friends, with the common ground being the untimely tragic loss of a child. The hosts are Will's ex-wife and her new husband, whom she met in a support group for bereaved parents. Eden (Tammy Blanchard), the ex-wife, is surprisingly happy and calm, in a way that bluntly contradicts Will's depression, paranoia and overall neurotics. Having mentioned some of the cast, allow me to say I was very impressed with the acting, especially the facial features and body language. While Marshall-Green is a very convincing paranoid grieving man and Blanchard an equally convincing griever turned slightly crazy, I was impressed the most with Lindsay Burdge as Sadie (sexy and promiscuous) and John Carroll Lynch as Pruitt (silent, violent and deadly), both able to portray their feature characteristics with nothing but a look. Honestly, I've added one point to my rating because of how awe-inspiring these two's acting was. The emphasized features of the film are the tense suspense, building up slowly and almost agonizingly from the start all the way to the final part, and the obscurity regarding Will's fears which keep you guessing all the way to the end. Every time a surprising occurrence or development supports Will's paranoia, another follows up to contradict it. There is simply no way to know, which serves to amplify the suspense and uneasiness. Director Karyn Kusama and screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi have definitely done their job.In the end, what truly gets under your skin is how realistic the depicted scenarios are. Nothing supernatural, nothing remotely unreal, just situations anyone could find themselves in, hence the compelling reason to feel afraid. In addition, I always love seeing more modern characters, like an interracial couple and a gay couple (which I very rarely see in Horror). It's okay to show it on screen, you know, welcome to 2017.All in all, I didn't expect the film to run and end the way it did. The pace is slower than my usual preference, and the feelings evoked are less in the line of ""fear"", and more ""discomfort"", ""uneasiness"" and ""danger"". Still, I very much appreciate the experience I went through while watching, and while I'll probably not watch it again - I'll be sure to recommend it to anyone looking for something a little different in the field of Horror.",The Invitation
62,avik-basu1889,How to deal with grief !!!,9,29 January 2017,"It's very difficult to assign a genre/film category to 'The Invitation'. Is it a hardcore drama? I think so. Is it a psychological thriller? Most certainly as it revels in its atmosphere of dread. Is it a horror film? From a certain angle, yes as there are moments of exploitation and gore which horror film fans will be familiar with. From a personal standpoint, my favourite horror/thrillers are the ones that work on a thematic as well as a generic level and 'The Invitation' is a prime example of a film that achieves success in that regard. I have to shower admiration on the screenplay written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. The script uses the central character of Will to give us a very poignant and sensitive exploration of grief and the struggles which come along in the process of dealing with it. Many films attempt to show us characters dealing with grief, but on many occasions, they can be underwhelming due to the lack of sophistication. 'The Invitation' offers us a very mature depiction of how it can be like to live with grief. The character remains somewhat aloof throughout the party. He has become a loner and seems uncomfortable for having to spend a whole evening in the house where he once used to stay with his family and where he had to experience the most painful event of his life. He wants to move on, but can't get rid of his self created guilt. He views Eden's elaborate attempts of joining a spiritual cult to get over the past as an act of denial. On one hand Will wants to move on, but on the other he thinks that ignoring what happened is a sign of betrayal to the spirit of his dead son. He is constantly fighting with himself. On a thematic level, the film is saying that grief is personal and the process of recovery is also personal. Your friends and loved ones can support you through the process, but in the end, it is you and only you who can get through it. As the last shot of the film shows, Kira can support Will, but she will never be able to force his recovery or act as a cataylst in his process of rehabilitation. The film takes a cynical stance on the communal nature of dealing with griefs through groups and cults. Forcing the process of rehabilitation as Eden and David attempt to do in the film doesn't serve any purpose.Karyn Kusama very effectively creates a claustrophobic atmosphere inside the house. She conjures up a tone drenched in paranoia. The film is shown pretty much from the point of view of Will. The editing and the transition from one scene to the next is at times a bit intentionally abrupt to put the doubt in the viewer's mind about whether Will's POV is reliable or not as we all know how distressed and paranoid he is. The film is shot well. The visual colour texture of the film shifts from the orange-ish hue of the scenes in the party to a bluish tinge in the flashback scenes. The camera isn't doing anything too radical, but there are two shots of Will's reflection on the mirror in two separate scenes (the first one involving him and David with the mirror in between them and the second one involving Will alone as we see two lines of multiple reflections on the mirror) that really impressed me. These two shots visually capture in an artistic sense, Will's fragmented psyche and his inner dilemmas. The acting is good from everyone involved, but I will give a special mention to Logan Marshall-Green and Tammy Blanchard. Green not only looks like Tom Hardy, but also has that charismatic masculine aura about him that one associates with Hardy. He remains stoic for the most part, but then peppers in moments of genuine vulnerability and brilliantly sells the inner turmoil and guilt that Will is going through. Blanchard plays the Hitchcock-ian mystery woman. She always looks mysterious and artificial and we get subtle hints from time to time of the darkness simmering underneath the smile.'The Invitation' is a brilliant work that succeeds as a suspenseful thriller as well as a mature exploration of grief and its accompanying dilemmas. The direction, writing and acting are pretty much perfect all over the board.",The Invitation

64,dansview,Wasted Potential with Great Imagery,6,31 May 2020,"The setting was eerie and memorable. The twinkling lights of L.A. below the hills where the conflicted creative class dwells, and existential madness ensues.I loved the red colored lantern effect in the backyards.Our main protagonist has wonderful gravitas and his girlfriend is gorgeous and silent.The opening scene is not subtle, but it is effective as a taste of what is to come. Nice work.There's a goof when the couple arrives at the man's former home. The girlfriend is surprised by the wealth it reflects. He then explains that his former wife came from money.But if he is your boyfriend, you would know that already. You just drove through the Hollywood Hills to get there anyways. That's where the rich live, and you would already know that your man used to live there.The big problem was with lack of character development. This was a reunion of friends who had been present together at a child's birthday party two years ago. But how did they meet before that? What do they do for a living?One guy is a nursing assistant, but we don't hear what the rest did, except a record producer who was not part of the original group of friends. There is no chemistry with any of them.Meanwhile the premise of the ultimate goal is not very creative. The hosts came up with the concept after new age training in Mexico. But that's all there is to it?Again the setting is great, and you can do so much with a reunion piece and the right dialogue. But this one falls flat. No one raises any interesting counter arguments to the philosophy espoused.I do buy the premise that shallow people live in the Hollywood Hills. But our lead does not seem like the kind of guy who would be married to the woman who became his ex. He seems more thoughtful and insightful.The horror aspects were mild compared to what you've scene. I appreciated that, and I'm ok with the twist.

In Karyn Kusama's 'The Invitation,' we get to be a fly on the wall in what can only be described as a gathering that is probably not on anyone's ""can't miss"" list.The film is really carried on the shoulders of Logan Marshall-Green, whose Will attends a dinner alongside his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi). Oh, did I mention the dinner takes place in his old house and is hosted by his ex-wife (Tammy Blanchard) and her new Hollywood mogul husband (Michiel Huisman)? Awk. But that's just the beginning...As the film progresses, we're drawn into a trance. We notice a number of things that can't be right, or are unsettling to say the least. But is everyone else crazy, or are we the ones who misunderstand? Slowly but surely, pieces begin to fall into place, but there's always an iota of doubt that still hangs in the air. Among the more effective aspects of 'The Invitation' are the use of the camera, which lingers to create a sense of suspense, to heavy dialogue that paints the picture of the strength of the group's friendship, with the exception of those who are new to their circle.This film poses some thoughtful questions: at what point does being polite end up costing you? How do you discern between friendly suggestion and forceful coercion? And how do you simply put past tragedy behind you and pretend all is okay?'The Invitation' is an overlooked example of how suspense can be done smartly - with precise screenwriting, deliberate dialogue and subtle twists and turns.",The Invitation

71,ginocox-206-336968,Sophomoric attempt at horror,4,19 April 2016,"""The Invitation"" feels as if it's a couple of drafts short of a finished screenplay. Most horror films are based on a simple premise. A sinful act unleashes a supernatural force that punishes the sinful, but spares the innocent and those who repent. Within this broad category, there is a genre of horror that Snyder calls Monster in the House. The elements are simple. The protagonist, who is usually a member of a group of people, is trapped somewhere (a house, a remote island, a spaceship, e.g.) with something evil that wants to kill him/them in some unimaginably horrible manner and he can neither leave nor summon assistance. TI puts a group of characters in a house with no cellular reception and no landline, with the windows and doors locked and barred, but they never seem trapped. The front door is deliberately left unlocked. They are free to wander outside. One guest leaves early. There is an intimation that the individual may have met some violent end, but it is never revealed. The protagonist repeatedly proclaims his intention to leave, but generally decides to stay on his own volition. Rather than building tension through an escalating series of frightening events, the story builds tedium, so much so that the protagonist frequently wanders off. Prior events and relationships supposedly impact the characters and their relationships, but aren't always clear. The death of their child several years earlier impacts the protagonist and his ex-wife in different ways, but it's not clear who was responsible for the child's death, which is an important element in horror, as the guilty are punished and the innocent are spared. The protagonist is supposedly conflicted with residual feelings toward his ex- wife and his love for his current wife, but neither relationship seems particularly vibrant or compelling. The composition of the dinner party is so blatantly politically correct as to seem unrealistic. We have an interracial couple, a gay couple and a woman who has lesbian tendencies with an ethnic mix including a couple of Asians, a Hispanic and an African-American. But none of the characters seems to do much of anything in real life. They marry, have children, take vacations and even go to jail, but nobody seems to have a career that defines them or provides a unique skill set that might help them survive. One is reminded of Checkov's gun. Much is made of the locked doors, barred windows and lack of cellular service, but when the monster reveals itself, none of it really matters to the monster's plan. The protagonist seems to be cast as a sort of Christ figure and is named (free) Will, while his ex-wife is named Eden. He looks a lot like the Christ in medieval and Renaissance paintings, with Aryan features and long tawny hair and beard, although probably not much like the historical Jesus. Eliminate the ""monsters"" and there are close to thirteen characters in the cast – Jesus and twelve disciples, one of whom leaves early. There's a lot of talk about an exotic vintage of wine, finding peace and guilt. It seems the filmmakers attempted to work in some sort of last supper Christian religious allegory, but it comes across a bit muddled and sophomoric. The final scene comes out of nowhere. It is a possible outcome of events alluded to in the film, but nothing as built up to it and there is no reason to expect certain things to be synchronized. Ordinarily the protagonist fights his/her way up the hierarchy of villains. The villain is not supposed to knowingly cause his/her own demise. There is no apparent distinction between innocent and guilty parties as to who survives. The film is disappointing because it fails to adhere to the basic paradigm of horror films. Performances are as good as can be expected with a weak script. Production values are adequate but not inspired.",The Invitation

When David and Eden show everyone a video of a religious cult practicing a process where its members meet their departed loved ones, things are not the same.A wafer thin storyline set in a single house requires a strong screenplay and interesting moments to keep the audience engaged - dealt with successfully. There are a few disappointing elements, one of them is its wrong billing as horror genre, its a suspense thriller and a drama at most. And the next is a dud of a climax - very predictable, poorly executed and doesn't pack a shock or impact element it so needed. Its a good effort for a low budget psychological thriller but there are other superior efforts that can easily shadow this. Better movies of a similar genre out there - watch 'Coherence' for a much better experience.",The Invitation

75,darkreignn,An invitation to accept,9,17 July 2016,"""The Invitation"" is a suspenseful, exciting, paranoia inducing, and thrilling film about a group of people who meet at the house of their mutual friend for a dinner party. What follows is an hour and ten minutes of a slow, effective, engaging, and brilliant build up to a disappointing climax, but the buildup alone makes this movie well worth the watch. Logan Marshall-Green plays Will, one of the people who were invited to the dinner party. The thing about the character of Will is that he is legitimately smart and acts like a normal person would act during an increasingly uncomfortable situation. As you, the viewer, start to notice things that are odd, Will does too. The host locks the front door? Will sees that, and calls him out on it. A weird video is shown to the guests that makes everyone uneasy? Not only does Will point out that the video made everyone uneasy, but he also demands to know why in the world that video was even played. He acts so realistically, not like you'd expect someone to act in a horror movie, and because of this he is magnetic. I couldn't take my eyes off of Logan Marshall-Green, and trust me, neither will you. He is a truly talented actor, and in my opinion, his acting made the film. Of course everyone else in the movie does a good job as well. Nobody feels like a fake person or a filler character, and by the end of the film I felt like I had gotten to know each and every character. As the night goes on, as stories are told and as old friendships are rekindled, so do you feel as if you have personally spent time with these people and gotten to know them. And because of this, you really do feel invested into what is going on.The buildup of this movie is also really well done. Some may consider it slow, but I never did. It was consistently riveting and always engaging, and you'll be wondering just how bizarre this dinner party is going to get. And as Will gets more and more paranoid and suspicious of seemingly inconsequential events, so do you share his feelings, worries, and suspicions. The acting is phenomenal, the tension is palpable, and the buildup is masterfully crafted. ""The Invitation"" is one of the best thrillers I've seen in years, and despite the predictable climax, I would recommend this movie to anybody. Definitely accept this invitation.",The Invitation

I didn't realize until Act 3, but the slow and personal story being told has a purpose.

79,supermaggie,"Boring, predictable, strange, senseless",3,9 June 2016,"When I heard that a new film with Logan Marshall-Green came out, I had to buy it immediately, so far this actor has never disappointed me, and besides I am a fan of clever horror. This movie, however, is far away from being clever or suspenseful. It offers utter boredom, uninteresting characters having uninteresting conversations (this is something we know from Cloverfield, but at least this movie provided some rare moments with a cool monster at the end ...). The plot is also completely predictable, I knew immediately what it boils down to, and when it finally comes to a minimum of action, you are already so annoyed and turned off that it does not matter anymore. In addition, the film itself suggests strange assumptions, and I am not even talking about the resolution, but (spoilers): 1. Why are animals seen as so worthless, that they can be killed/sacrificed for gimmicky, unnecessary shock moments? 2. Why are the nut jobs/cult members always portrayed as vegetarians? Just because the people eating meat have no discipline and no morals and can't give up meat, does not mean that they may show/label vegetarians as crazy, the opposite is the case. 3. Sometmes suicide is obviously not bad, because if the wacko ex-wife would have killed herself after the death of her son as she wanted to, the others would have been spared. Strange. And the twist at the end is a complete failure, not credible and can't help it anymore/just makes it worse - too bad, could have been a good movie, but nobody needs this film.",The Invitation
80,quaseprovisorio,"it's slow, has some useless characters and could be better built, but i did enjoy it.",7,19 April 2020,"I enoyed it first because i think the build up is good. Yes, you might argue it takes too long and that some scenes could be unnecessary. That's true, but at the same time this is almost a character-only film where Will is confronted with his ghosts of the past. This is pretty much what the movie is about: the travel of this character throughout things he put on the back of his head that he remembers now because he's back to that house. and to guess what's actually going on, being the one who's more comfortable to to point the elephant in the room - he lived there and was married with the hostess.the movie has some predictability on how it goes, but it keeps you guessing until the end, due to clues that start to be there, but then they're explained and you don't know if it's going on what you predict or not. in that sense i think the script was well made, even though it might have some flaws on how it presents some of the events. plus some characters such as will's girlfriend are unnecessary in my biew, and most of the other don't have much to talk about - it's almost everyhing towards how they relate to wil than anything else.Still you can't say the movie is bad directed, that the cinematography is bad or even that it doesn't build suspense. It does, and that makes you on keep guessing. plus the ending is good, you don't know how things will be solved. you have no idea when you see the purpose of the invitation coming into life. Maybe the build up could be a bit different, maybe the ending motives could have been changed...but i enjoyed this movie and i don't understand what's so much to complain here. it doesn't rush into things and has a solid main character with a good logan marshall green.so yeah if you like movies that build up tension slowly until the main revelations i would recommend. if you are more into thrillers that have quicker reveals i wouldn't. but patience in important in movies too.",The Invitation
81,gregking4,slow burn horror and tense psychological thriller,7,13 August 2015,"The Invitation is the new psychological thriller from Karyn Kusama (the superb Girlfight and the awful, messy sci-fi action thriller Aeon Flux, etc) and is a study in delusion, paranoia and suspicion. This is a slow burn horror story about a reunion of old friends that goes horribly wrong. Will (Logan Marshall-Green, recently seen in Madame Bovary, etc) has reluctantly accepted an invitation to attend a dinner party reunion with some old friends at the house he once owned with his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard). But since their divorce Eden now lives in the house with her new husband David (Michiel Huisman), whom she met on a retreat in Mexico while recovering from a nervous breakdown. Will is still grieving over the tragic death of his son, and is in a fragile emotional state. He begins to feel that something is not quite right about the gathering, but is he unnecessarily paranoid or does he have reason to be concerned? There are early portents that something is wrong, and a palpable air of uneasiness and distrust soon overtakes the gathering. When the hosts insist on playing a rather unsettling parlour game the awkwardness further enhances the growing sense of uneasiness. Writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (Crazy/Beautiful, the dire buddy cop comedy Ride Along, etc) have created a cast of oddball characters to add to the creepy atmosphere. Most of the cast is not that well known, which works in the film's favour. John Carroll Lynch has a vaguely sinister and menacing presence as the mysterious stranger Pruitt. The action is confined to a single location and Kusama makes the most of the claustrophobic setting, slowly ramping up the tension until the film bursts into full on mayhem and carnage. The impact of the final shot is devastatingly effective as the full horror of what is happening is revealed.",The Invitation

84,Jared_Andrews,"To The Invitation, I Send My Regrets",1,31 July 2016,"The Invitation is, in a word, irritating. It overflows with unnecessarily jumpy flashbacks and blurred memories in an effort to appear mysterious. The movie wants you to believe that it is complicated and deep. But it isn't. The movie is simple and shallow.The filmmakers spend so much time stuffing our faces with distracting, strange music and even stranger behavior of the dinner guests in an attempt to unnerve us viewers. They want you to find the evening weird (which it is) and confusing (which it isn't) so you will have doubts about what will happen (you shouldn't because the answer is obvious).Here is the premise of the movie (I will write this as simplistically as the movie presents it). Old friends who haven't seen each other in years all arrive at a dinner party hosted by one friend and her new husband. The night is basically a reunion except everyone is a little uncomfortable to see each other again. So actually it's just a reunion.As the evening carries on the hosts exhibit increasingly odd behaviors, which make the guests uncomfortable and the protagonist (a bearded, long-haired man named Will) suspicious. The hosts are both awkwardly happy, which the hostess explains is due to their choice to do away with negative emotions. As if human beings can simply choose not to experience any undesirable feelings. Her pontification is extremely irritating to hear and extremely false.Later, the hosts show everyone a video of a 20something year old cancer patient dying and beam about how wonderful it is, how wonderful death is because it is the only way to truly be free.""Are you guys in a cult?"" One guest blurts the question that needed asking.They are. Obviously. Of course they deny half-heartedly then attempt to distract everyone with a bizarre new party game. I'll spare the details, just know that it makes the guests uncomfortable.After watching this scene, most viewers probably expect the remainder of the movie's plot to play out in a painfully predictable sequence. It does. Once again I will spare the details since certain readers may still want to watch this movie for some reason. Rest assured that nothing will surprise you.I mentioned how much this movie irritated me, and I want to briefly speak on that point once more. I will mention particulars about the opening scene and how it connects with the remainder of the movie. Here we go.*Minor Spoiler Alert* The film opens with a couple (Will and his girlfriend) driving to a dinner party that neither seems particularly excited to attend, a relatable concept for many of us. The car suddenly hits a coyote, which serves as the first jump scare of the movie. Will exits the vehicle to inspect the situation and eventually mercy kills the animal with a tire iron.I am uncertain about the purpose of this scene. Maybe it was merely an unsettling appetizer for the uncomfortable dinner party that followed. Perhaps it was just a red herring, like much of the movie. Maybe it was intended to introduce the cult's message that dying is the only way to escape from pain.Maybe, but I hope not because it's a terrible parallel to the beliefs of the cult member dinner hosts. The coyote's circumstances don't apply at all to any of the attendees of the dinner party. The coyote experiences excruciating pain and will die within minutes. The people were not injured. None of them were hit by cars. None of them are sick. They are going to live healthy and happy lives for the next 40 or 50 years. Sure, they have their struggles, but they will have plenty of opportunities to be happy. The coyote will not.*End of Spoiler* And I'm finished. Sorry for the rant.

We are left with next to no action here, just waiting for the obvious, the main character tells you what is going to happen right from the start, you can choose to believe him or not, that's not the problem here. They could have made the ending different by twisting it somehow, but they decided to go for the blatantly obvious ending everyone anticipated.People are trying to pass this movie as clever and deep, which it isn't in the slightest, the plot is extremely linear start to finish with a couple of stupid flashbacks in the middle, which are just a pathetic attempt at making this movie more complex, eventually none of that matters, since as i said the plot is linear and the story unfolds exactly like you thought it would.Acting here is somewhat bareable, not the worst acting ever, the movie is nicely made too, just to give some posittives, if it wasn't for the obvious, linear plot and the action being confined to the last 20 minutes it could have been a great hostage thriller, i really hate when writers have a fairly decent premise, but choose to run it down the drain.Overall, this movie is really plain and simple, could even say flat out boring, since there is nothing but a dinner party happening for the majority of the screentime.

Included in this party are a group of old friends and a couple of weirdo's. My initial thought was we were in for some kind of sacrifice film, her and her new husband seemed odd from the offset and within 10 minutes this film was signaling exactly where it was going. Inbetween our protagonist had outbursts during the fleeting moments he actually spent in everyone's company, suggesting that they were involved in a cult then being talked down by one of his friends only to do the exact same thing again 3 minutes later... there we have our story line. The film attempted to confuse the viewer to have us thinking along the lines of our protagonist, to think there was something odd then to climb down and accept that all was normal. Sadly the story and plot were so badly hammed and hashed together than really, only a complete imbecile would have failed to see where this film was going. It didn't surprise, it didn't shock, it just annoyed. For some reason they kept the lighting minimal, perhaps to add some tension - it failed. For some reason they made no attempt at keeping any secrets or hiding anything to do with the plot, it was lit up like a Christmas tree. When the doo doo eventually hits the fan i was actually relieved but simultaneously disappointed that there was no weird twist, it all played out exactly how i thought after 5-10 minutes of watching. Indeed, the only slight surprise was the very last scene but it certainly didn't salvage any Brownie points for this film.

There is a fair amount of tension and paranoia in the film, which I'm sure was intentional in order to give the plot substance. However I felt like the director over relied on this and paid far too little attention to the actual story.

101,charles000,"goes beyond the usual ""thriller"" genre' with its own unique twist . . . very well done",9,11 July 2016,"This is a psychological thriller which truly lives up to the genre', and goes beyond with its own unique twist.Yes, it does start out a bit slowly at first, but in this case, this appropriately fits the emergent story quite perfectly.The character studies are remarkably well done, capturing the essence of a collection of friends from various walks of life who are called together for the somewhat mysterious invitation . . . which appears suddenly after several years of absence from the key couple who sent them out.And this is where it begins. No, I won't tell what exactly the invitation is actually for, but let's just say, what starts out as a somewhat awkward reunion with various tensions from the past coming to light as the group comes together, what emerges is something truly, well, terrifying.But not in the usual cookie cutter type thriller plot line. No, this one is different, quite different actually, which makes it truly worth the watch.The emergent premise which becomes evident may seem a bit extreme or unbelievable to some, but actually, this is not that far off from similar situations which have really occurred, and no doubt were the likely inspiration for this production.Karyn Kusama deserves some serious directing credit for pulling this off and really making it work. This production could have turned out to be a cheesy disaster without the right pacing, and emphasis on the emergent psychological traits and fragilities which bubble up to the surface as the night progresses in this scenario.It's a bit difficult to pick exactly who delivers the best acting in their roles, since all was delivered with remarkable accuracy for what was being portrayed, but if anything, Marieh Delfino's ""Claire"" is chillingly spot on. The desperation to acquire a newly defined version of ""normalcy"" and resolution via a horrifically bad path towards achieving such is captured perfectly.There is a bit of gore here, but that's not the real point of the film. The real point is the bizarre extremes to which once quasi normal people will drift toward, particularly if seduced under the trance of a charismatic prophet, who propels them to what may seem as bizarrely illogical ends to others, but makes perfect sense to them.Apparent normalcy is a surface veneer, marginally disguising a hideously distorted restructuring of reality, for those who are easily swayed under such circumstances.Trust me on this, there really are people out there who fit this description, and predatory prophets with bizarre agendas who are all too clever at manipulating such vulnerable targets.That is what this film explores and delivers. This is not a ""big budget"" production by any stretch of the imagination, but for what it is, this is remarkably well crafted.Even if the typical thriller genre' is not your usual cup of tea, you might want to consider watching this one.",The Invitation

I was genuinely feeling anxious, my heart beating in a way I have never experienced before. The way this sense of genuine dread, which is a way became claustrophobic, making me want to just look away, talk a walk, breath, was created in such an unbelievably easy, but thereby also genius way. You simply had to nudge the acting slightly off cue, stylizing it in such a way that it narrows the uncanny valley in the opposite direction.Added visual cues, the music, and our focus point Will's slightly unbalanced state helps building upon this - but the fact that the world we are experiencing is just slightly off key, was all it took. Gradually all of these factors become more and more exaggerated, but is a very slow pace, slow enough that you accept the world, believe it, and get a certain footing in it - which only makes the experience more unnerving. It feels like there is a ticking timer. that something will happen, that nothing is like it should be.The only negative here is that despite all of these artistic successes, certain aspects make it feel like a directorial debut, something it is far from being, and I feel that both the very beginning and the end were lacking just a little in skill and thought.The Innvitation is without a doubt an incredible work, but I feel that it would have been a true personal favorite with only a few slight changes.",The Invitation
103,themissingpatient,The Sunshine of Psychological Thrillers,6,20 April 2016,"The Invitation is a slowly paced, carefully constructed psychological thriller. Will and his girlfriend are attending a dinner party at his old house, hosted by his ex-wife and her new husband. It's an understandably awkward situation for Will, whose eyes we, the audience, are watching the events through. As the film moves forward, the past is revealed and we come to understand why these characters are where they are. As this happens, questions about the present intentions of the characters become more predominant. As Will becomes more suspicious and paranoid, we do too. The subtle way in which this is done is absolutely brilliant.There comes a point where The Invitation begins to elevate itself into a devastatingly effective and tragic character study. Instead, the filmmakers decided to give the film a more audience-friendly twist, lowering the final act to the level of a cliché horror show. It almost works, as in the moment it is very satisfying. However, what follows is so terribly executed, it undermines what had been such an intelligent, tense, thought-provoking, mysteriously eerie, paranoid-inducing thriller.As disappointing as the final act is, the majority of The Invitation makes it worth watching.

She's an old friend who disappeared from their lives after a traumatic experience. Everyone knows going in that it's going to be weird and uncomfortable they do genuinely miss this person. The film tries to focus it's story around little forewarnings and twists to keep you guessing, all the building a kind of thick atmosphere that drags you along with the main character. In that latter part it succeeds brilliantly. The atmosphere, sound and acting for the most part kept even me in the long after I got tired of how ridiculous the characters were being in light of the forewarnings...and that's the problem. The moment in the film where the little warnings start. Instead of it being small things it's like a bomb going off and no one in their right mind would stick around to see if it was a dud and when you watch the supporting character go ""well thats weird. more wine?"" you just wanna turn it off right then and there. However if you can just turn of your brain and move along with the main character it's quite captivating. So I guess my recommendation is, if you can get past how stupid the movie is, it's worth sticking around for the end. I enjoyed it, no I'd say skip this if you can't stand silly plots. I'd compare this to ""The Gift"", that recent masterpiece by Joel edgerton. That's how you keep people guessing.

So far it is a critical hit (over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes) and was a hit at the numerous film festivals it premiered at months ago.LMG plays a damaged man who has been through a lot in his life and is still grieving for his past mistakes. He and a few others get invited to a mysterious dinner party where things go from normal to strange very, very quickly. But the interesting thing is only one character (LMG) seems to see the strangeness while everyone else is laughing it up and enjoying the night. It's interesting because he isn't afraid to speak his mind about how he feels the night is going and what he finds 'strange'. But the sad part is, he's seen as a damaged soul so his outbursts are immediately dismissed. It's the subtle clues he notices (something as basic as a drinking game or a bottle of expensive wine) that make The Invitation suspenseful. Tiny clues that leave you guessing that something larger is at play, which may or may not be the case. To say anything more would be potentially spoiling the movie, and with most movies, it's the ending that makes or breaks a movie and this one is no different. The ending is well worth the wait, so if you are a fan of suspenseful movies, this is one of the years must see thrillers.",The Invitation
106,stefankrs,Long and pointless build up for what everyone came to watch,3,10 September 2021,This movie is so unreasonably slow and long for building up what we know is going to happen.

107,HorrorOverEverything,Effective Slow Burn Thriller,7,11 April 2016,"The main thing ""The Invitation"" does right is build tension, it has a nice casual tone yet they find little ways to slowly build up tension between the characters. The story is simple but interesting and does a good job of throwing the viewer for loop on a few occasions.Not a whole lot to say about this one since it is hard to really go into detail about it with out spoiling anything, it's one of those films that is probably best enjoyed knowing very little about it, I would suggest not watching the trailer if you haven't yet. They did good job with a low budget: Film is shot very well, the majority of the small cast is believable, and nothing ever looked fake or forced. If you don't mind a slow pace this is definitely worth checking out, one of the better new thrillers I have seen lately. 7.5/10",The Invitation

112,thelastblogontheleft,A slow burning gem,8,23 February 2017,"Oh, this was a freaking gem. I'm always psyched to explore woman-directed horror and thriller movies, and Karyn Kusama — with her fourth full-length film — is fantastic at keeping the tension taut and the suspicion simmering.Will (the intense Logan Marshall-Green, a dead ringer for a more emotionally scarred Tom Hardy) is driving along the Hollywood hills with his girlfriend, Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi), on their way to a dinner party. The weird vibes are established early on — and with shocking delivery — when they hit a coyote and Will is finding himself having to put the poor animal out of its misery with a tire iron found in the trunk. They arrive, albeit a bit shaken, at the party, which takes place in Will's former home and is hosted by his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new husband, David (Michiel Huisman). The motivation for the party is unclear at first, and all involved seem a bit confused but optimistic (aside from Will, who is on guard from the second he walks in), until there begins to be talk of a cult-like group in Mexico and a bizarre video that almost feels like a call for recruitment. The group deals with grief, something that Eden and Will share deeply as we learn in various flashbacks that show their son dying in an accident right before their eyes. The dinner continues to be vaguely bizarre until an AWESOME surprise ending.Firstly, the feeling of dread and almost suffocation is palpable. It's brilliant, especially since it starts within the first minute of the movie, before anything has even begun to go wrong. You just immediately feel like you want to get the hell out of that house, and you're eyeballing everyone with intense suspicion.The cinematography is wonderfully done by Bobby Shore (furiously scanning his IMDb page to see what else of his I can watch). The entire movie feels decadent and sparkling despite this mystery simmering beneath the surface, and the scenes where they flash back to the son's death are haunting, especially the one where Will is in his son's old room and imagines laying face to face on the bed with him, both breaking into smiles heartbreaking doesn't even begin to cover it. There's a few standout scenes in particular — Will in the bathroom with the mirrors seemingly in a state of neverending reflection, and the group moving to the upper floor with the camera focused on their feet ascending the stairs perfect.When Will rejoins the party after hearing Choi's chilling voicemail, the music is almost like a swarm of bees it's perfect. There's just so many small, understated moments that make this movie stand out to me.You know Will is right to suspect something bizarre happening, and to be frustrated as hell by Eden and David's overbearing eccentricity and fluffy talk about letting go of useless emotions, and yet the awkwardness and anxiety you feel when he finally starts to openly freak out is very real but so deserved, because for much of the movie you're reminded of our society's bullshit willingness to suspend our real emotions in favor of being accepted or polite.It's this slow burn of tension for a majority of the movie until the last 20 minutes or so, which will make you grip whatever's closest to you as you watch in disbelief. I won't totally spoil it for you — trust me, I thought about it — but it's good. It's action packed and intense and disturbingly realistic and still a bit heartbreaking and the ending was just A+. Really great all around, and this makes me even more excited to finally see XX (a horror anthology that was released this month which has a short film directed by Kasuma in it).",The Invitation

114,RMurray847,Surprisingly creepy movie,7,8 January 2021,"It seems like this film gets billed as a horror movie, but it really isn't. It's certainly a SUSPENSE movie though. It requires a bit of suspension of disbelief on the viewer's part (the main character tolerates a bit more than you would think he reasonably would), but it is consistently creepy. It's the kind of film that balances you very nicely between not knowing what is going on, and thinking you have a good idea of what's going on. You're given enough info and hints to keep you interested, but you don't get the full picture until nearly the end.Logan Marshall Green plays a young man still grieving over the death of his child. He and his new girlfriend receive an invitation to join his ex-wife and her new significant other, along with some other old friends, for a dinner party at his old house. It's a house that's filled with painful memories; he's clearly torn between attending this party and staying the heck away from his old place. But he still has feelings for his ex; they shared a terrible closeness with what happened to their child. She claims she's found a way to heal, and she wants him to share it. So he goes.It becomes pretty clear early on that his ex and her new beau have been to a ""retreat"" to work on healing, but that it was also probably one that was a little bit more ""out there"" than doing some yoga and sharing feelings in a circle. Green and his friends have various reactions to what they hear, from laughter to anger to incredulity. Yet no one leaves...this is the slightly unbelievable part of the film. SOMEONE would find an excuse to leave. But we need everyone there for the story...so, disbelief suspended. The creepy tone of the film more than earns our temporary forgiveness.Enter the brilliantly creepy John Carroll Lynch (a terrific character actor) and things go from mildly off-kilter to full-on ""something is really wrong here."" I won't say any more, but suffice it to say that even if you think you have figured out where the film is going, you won't see everything that happens coming. Events quickly spiral and the film goes from a slow burn to full-tilt craziness.I really liked the film because director Karyn Kusama wasn't afraid to let it build slowly. The effect is to slowly put the viewer on edge, just like our protagonist. We feel, as he does, that things aren't right. But we also see how perhaps he's just being a little paranoid. Surely his worst fears can't be true; is his own imagination getting the best of him?Green gives a very nice, lived-in performance and Lynch hits a home run. The other performers are less successful, with a couple of downright clunky performances. This is how the movie shows its low budget. A couple of solid performers were acquired and the rest was filled in with actors happy for a role to boost their imdb profiles. This, despite the moments where disbelief must be suspended, is really what keeps this movie from being 5-star. But it is nonetheless very well worth watching. It's mastery of tone and the twists the plot takes are well worth jumping into.",The Invitation

119,midas-jacobs,Never gonna accept an invitation again...,6,4 September 2016,"""The invitation"" is an indie film, where our protagonist is called Wil. Will get's invited to a party, organized by his ex-wife. During the party Will starts to realize that his ex-wife might not be like she was...The director of this movie had previously made some bad movies, like Æon Flux for example. So I was a bit skeptical about how this movie would turn out. But I heard a lot of good things about ""The Invitation"", so I decided to watch it. And, was it good? Kind of. It mostly felt like a movie made by movie-school students, but this isn't the fault of the director. Well, partially it is, and in this review I'll try to explain why that is. The director of the movie is called Karyn Kusama. She did a good job at directing the movie. Each shot looked nice, and the use of color really helped with this. The more warmer colors were accentuated to give the movie a more ""cosy"" feel. The color red is also accentuated a lot, the wine, the torch etc. This I believe was done to represent the blood that will be shed, and that lays upon the hands of each character, or will lay on them, I should say. If this was their goal, I think that it is a fun detail. The exciting/action scenes were handled good, nothing to shaky, and with good tension. The pacing was also one of the better parts of the movie. The editing wasn't the greatest. It was done in sloppy ways multiple times, mostly when people where talking. The sound of their voice wasn't completely gone and suddenly it just abruptly stops. The soundtrack however was done good. Sometimes it had its original songs in it, I believe, which is good. The style of the songs though wasn't really consistent. Sometimes you had these weird songs, that could fit in with the TV-show ""Utopia"", but sometimes you had your ""normal"" songs. I think that they should've gone for one or the other, but not both. The make-up was done well, everything looked The acting was the main part why this felt like a movie-school film. It wasn't very good. The actor of our protagonist, Will, was one of the worst actors in the movie. Him and one other girl, I'll mention in a bit. Will was played by Logan Marshall-Green. He under-preformed in the emotional scenes. You could see he was trying, but succeeding didn't really work out for him. In the non-emotional scenes he wasn't bad, but nor was he the greatest in those. He was accompanied by his new girlfriend, I suppose, Kira. She was better than Logan Marshall- Green and I found her to be acting fine in the action scenes. Mostly reminded me of your average actress in a mediocre horror- flick. But on average she was good. The antagonist of the movie was in my opinion also the best actor of ""The Invitation"". Michiel Huisman played him. Huisman is a good actor, he has proved that multiple times this time he again succeeds at it. He co-bad guy, in this case co-bad girl, was also pretty good. She was played by Tammy Blanchard. Now that I've mentioned some good actors I'll end this paragraph with a bad one again. The actress of Sadie, Lindsay Burdge, wasn't that good. She overacted and was mostly annoying.The writing was kind of good, but fails at the end and characters. The only character they develop is the main one, and they succeed at that, but they only develop him. That's the problem. The antagonists don't get any character development, we only see a couple of video messages that give us their motive to do all these things. But that isn't that big of a mistake: a lot of big budget movies do that as well. None the less that it is a mistake. The ending, like I mentioned is also something bad. It's just so unbelievable that so many people in such a tiny place, well tiny, believe in that kind of cult. And that so many people got brainwashed by it. It was just to unbelievable to be good. The dialogue was good, though. At times it was intriguing, and I wasn't bored at any time. Another good part I want to mention that has something to do with the script is a bit of symbolism that they put in there. In the beginning of the movie Will has to kill a coyote to end its suffering, and at the end of the movie Will doesn't end the suffering of his ex-wife. That's something I like, even if this was the thing they were going for, otherwise the beginning scene would've been completely useless. And the last thing I want to mention is: Where did Sadie go? She is seen standing up again and then proceeding to follow Will, but then we don't see her again, and she has not been reported dead. So where did she go? Or did I just miss something?Well, in the end this was a fine movie, that had me on the edge of my seat. The acting was only really my biggest complaint, but the writing had some flaws too. 6.0/10",The Invitation

Sadly what i got was ... something shot like a tv show with a script so light the logline IS the story.It's not so much that the movie has plot holes - it's that the entire movie is a collection of filler scenes punctuated by the occasional device to move the story forward, and half the time it ends up being awkward or filling 'forced'.As it is tradition in those movies, the editor tried to salvage things by layering a dozen or so tracks of 'scary violins' to generate fear where there's no on-screen reason to be afraid. *sigh*I'd give it more stars if the ending had been good, but unfortunately, it's the weakest part of the entire film.Very forgettable despite its good intentions to be a bit different.",The Invitation

Everything else is questionable, but the climax and falling action is what makes this film reputable. That sort of aha moment the characters have changes the course of the movie forever. You get a weight laid on you and you go from calm and inactive to white knuckle and at the edge of your seat. This change happens so fast it shocks you and throws you out of this world. I think the devices the director uses to convey this transformation is astounding. Light, sound, setting, acting. It all changed so quickly and you got into an awe that is so horror. This is a psychological horror and granted it deserves it, because it really screwed with my mind. Psychological horror movies are hard to watch because most of the time they are either too scary or not scary enough, and there isn't that balance, but this movie was able to keep this in that psychological category of horror.CONS: This movie is so slow. You sit there watching the screen roll by and you just yawn and move to the next seen. Granted the director tries to add slight hints of fear, but it just doesn't work. And when I say boring, I mean boring. They take literally an hour until they even start to use the character development they built over the time period. I felt that the acting got bruised because of this because of how slow the movie was, because at the end the movie really picks up and so does the acting, but when the movie wasn't intense the acting wasn't good. www.chorror.com",The Invitation

125,Oberrated,A hidden gem within the horrid land of Netflix horror movies,7,12 March 2017,"""The Invitation"" definitely did a lot of things well versus the typical horror movie on Netflix or even just within the genre itself comparing to ""Hollywood"" horror movies released in theaters.I was especially fond of the mystery that lasted throughout the entire film. It was honestly scene after scene where I found myself wondering wtf was going on. On top of the mystery feel of the film, I especially appreciate films that make it seem like the ""good guy"" may not actually be the good guy. A film that can do that well often splits its audience in two until the reveal finally hits if a certain person or party is the villain of a film.However, although I enjoyed the film, I was a bit bothered by some plot points and lack of common sense (that we all too often witness in these kinds of horror/thrillers). Certain points were clearly missed in regards to being explained and some were simply just holes, never to be visited again. Another thing I was not fond of what the characters beyond the three main ones. Everyone else was pointless and simply a part of the herd to slaughter. No development, no point, just meatshields for the movie.But otherwise, definitely not a terrible flick. I enjoyed it much more than I anticipated.-- Oberrated.com --",The Invitation
126,A_Llama_Drama,Journeys and Destinations,9,12 October 2017,"I was intrigued by The Invitation due to the (seriously) glass of red wine on the poster. It looked at once mature and alluring but also incredibly dark. I convinced my brother to watch it with me one night and this is our story.The Invitation sets itself up as a dark tale from the opening scene. A car ride ends in disaster and our hero, while going to his ex- wife's home for a dinner party, has to put an animal out of its misery. Will is unreadable, clearly suffering some form of PTSD. His girlfriend is supportive but it's obvious she's kept outside of his thought processes. When they arrive at the dinner party, it's hard to believe they know any of the guests. Actually, they've all been friends for years but, as anyone who's ever gone to a dinner part would know, it can be hard to be comfortable when there is a giant, dead elephant in the room. Everyone is at once eerily cheery but also naturally superficial. Is it Will's attitude that's causing conversation to stop dead every time people are reminded of his presence?Eden enters and you realise she's struggling just as much as Will. Eden is Will's ex, newly remarried and eager to show off the lifestyle that has brought her peace. It's revealed that their son died in an accident and that the grief and blame tore the couple apart. The difference between Eden and Will is, she's trying (not very well, mind you) to get over it. And so there you have it. A middle-class dinner party that is about grief and madness and red wine. The guests are trying hard to forget the ugliness of the tragedy that rendered all their lives and Will is doing his damndest to drag the corpse into the light for everyone to gape at. Who's really crazy here? Is it the middle-class manners that mean avoiding harsh topics and not allowing your friends the chance to really grieve? Is it the grieving father who wants to find horror in everything just to cope? Or is it the grieving mother who has turned to a specific religion to help her understand life and death?As the tension mounts and conversation topics become darker and harder to avoid, Will's becomes increasingly paranoid. Both he and Eden are looking for answers to their son's death and perhaps they could be found if they weren't too busy with one trying to blame the other and one doing all they can to forget. The director does a stellar job in maintaining a mundane and banal tone to the first half of the film. These people are dull but their situation has forced them to be. As the evening continues, though, the sense of screws turning, pennies dropping and clothes shedding becomes palpable. People are not who they seem and it's difficult to tell who is being honest with their intentions and who isn't just plain crazy.The movie builds to a dazzling final act that is satisfyingly violent. Not only that but it offers a devastating look at grief and how easily those grieving can be manipulated.So when we started watching, my brother was complaining about the banality of the conversations. The lack of anything compelling. As the story continued, he began to quieten down. When it finished, he told me, two days later, that he couldn't stop thinking about it. Such was the impact that a story steeped in humanity gone awry had had on him. And myself, for that matter. I'd recommend it.

You know what would've been good? How about instead of faffing around with ""Oh, I'm so sad about my son dying"" and all that jazz, how about you do the whole ""Oh crap, we're in a suicide pact"" within the first thirty minutes, and then have the rest of the movie be about trying to get out, discovering hints about the cult along the way. I'd watch that, I'd eat that up.""But it's a slow paced thriller"" you might say. And that's fine. If you wanted to make a movie about a man coming to terms with his son's death while visiting his ex-wife, and externalizing his guilt and sadness onto them, make that movie. If you want to make a movie about escaping a suicide pact, make that movie. Don't make 2/3 of the first film, and then cram the second film in the last 15 minutes before the credits role. That's just bad pacing IMO.Maybe I'm not the right audience for this film. In fact, that's probably more likely the case, but I was drawn in by the premise, and disappointed by the outcome.

It is a very suspenseful thriller that builds until your blood pressure is at an unhealthy level.With the exception of the first five minutes, I could not move from my seat. I am glad I stuck with this after that first scene in the road.First of all, I probably would not accept a dinner invite from my ex with my new partner, but that's me. But I digress. Will plays the grief-stricken father with absolute, soulful conviction. His partner, Kiera, is very likable and provides some sanity through the chaos of the other...umm...shall we say, less grounded characters? However, some of the characters could have been more subtle - I mean, they just had ""crazytown"" written all over them. But I still loved it.The end (and by the end, I mean the last five minutes), was totally unexpected.This movie is a must for lovers of psychological thrillers and/or anyone who has been in such depths of grief that for a time, you would rather have been dead than gone on living with the pain.This movie draws a fine line between cautionary fear and paranoia - good luck telling the difference - it won't be easy with this thrill ride.",The Invitation
129,shannen-l-c,A chilling and memorable thriller that has a lingering impact,8,16 February 2018,"Going into this movie I knew nothing about it so had no expectations, yet found myself hooked within the first 15 minutes. From the get go there's this underlying tension and mystery that has you trying to guess what's going to happen next. The main character, Will, is a surprisingly empathetic character in comparison to most leads in thriller/horror movies. As a viewer you really feel that you're experiencing the evening through his eyes and although his state of mind is constantly in question, his actions are often completely justified and reasonable from the perspective of any sane person. The tension is slowly built upon throughout and you can feel the plot progressing in a pre-determined direction. Although in parts it's predictable, everything that happens is a perfect pay-off, which negates the predictability. Despite the fact that we don't learn a great deal about any the characters (except Will), they're all very realistic people that have unique personalities, which again is something that is rarely found in the supporting characters of movies. Furthermore, the friendships between the characters were also well portrayed. As a viewer, it really feels like you're watching a bunch of good friends that have fallen out of touch with each other's lives and are trying to find their rhythm again. But one of my favourite things about The Invitation which seems to be overlooked by a lot of people, is the underlying theme of grief. The whole movie acts as a metaphor for grief and how it deeply it affects people. Every character in the movie has been affected by the same loss (even if just by association) and they're all dealing with it in an incredibly different way. I think this is what takes the movie from being a traditional thriller/slasher to something much more complex, because despite appearances, there's a much more complex meaning behind it. The only reason this movie didn't get the full 10 stars from me is because the ending is a little anti-climatic after such a long build-up. There's one particular scene towards the end that's incredible, but after that everything sort of unravels rather erratically. However, the very last scene is haunting and adds to the impact of the movie as a whole. Overall, I loved this movie and would definitely recommend it to anyone that's a fan of thought provoking thrillers that encompass very real and relatable human emotions that we all struggle through.",The Invitation
130,DVR_Brale,A serious movie about coping with loss where atmosphere is more important that the plot itself,7,31 July 2016,"The story plays completely at residence of Will's ex-wife. She and her new husband organize a dinner for a few old friends thus inviting Will and his girlfriend. Will finds this dinner party quaint. He starts to notice some weird behavior patterns which make him question the purported reason for the party.But Will is still coping with the loss. He's not completely mentally stable. Other people look so happy, especially his ex-wife. This way movie sets the tone for guessing what might be really happening.There's really not much to the story. For the most part of the movie we watch people hanging out and wait to see if Will is just imagining or is something more serious going on. Those of you who like fast paced movies with evolving plot are not going to like this one.There's a wealth of material for thinking under the hub. The Invitation invites us to think about dealing with loss. Do we have to get rid of the pain no matter what or is it OK to do a little about it? How come some look so happy and strong even after tragedy stroke? This questions are what we should focus on while watching the movie.Yeah, I know it's sometimes boring to watch liberals hanging out.

I will first state that this movie is Insane in the most positive way possible and that it is a true Marvel to watch. I will start with the story which is about a man and his girlfriend who get invited to a dinner party at his ex's house with her new man along with a group of other friends after 2 years. The story then starts to unfold that something isn't quite kosher. The pace was scary good with some of the best pacing I have ever witnessed in cinema history. I will move onto the acting which is Absolutely Stunning with both ""Logan Marshall-Green"" and GOT's actor ""Michiel Huisman"" stealing the show. They both deserve awards for their performances. The entire cast did Amazing but those two stole the entire movie. I will now continue with the action and drama section. Wow this is where it truly comes to fruition that this is a contender for the best movie of 2016. I mean the atmosphere and the tension that builds towards what is in my opinion the most Awesome culmination to a film I have seen in the past decade. I will finish with the Cinematography which was Impeccable with every scene building up something sinister and not quite right with the whole entourage that is gathered for the dinner party. I will close with saying that this movie is a Masterpiece and it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. OMG the ending was Epic and of course no spoilers. My hat comes off to Karyn Kusama who directed such a transfixing film.",The Invitation

We focus on the main character´s grief, which in the end isn´t that important, while the other characters are completely ignored. One tiny conversation with each one of them, that´s all we know. The girlfriend Kira literally disappears for an hour. It often feels like Will is all by himself in that house. Suspicion gets bigger but none of the guests seem to care about anything. There are some small comments, of course, but we have 5 or 6 characters devoid of any personality or will. I feel like some events could have been much stronger if those characters weren´t merely filling the space.There are some fine things, though, I´d never wanted to punch John Carroll Lynch so hard in the face.

139,Kingkitsch,Not bad and not good.,6,14 July 2016,"Damn, this is one polarizing movie. Viewers seem to either love it, or hate it. After a watch, I'm going for a six of ten. This isn't an easy movie to pigeonhole. Is it a thriller, or horror? Actually it's both. The plot has been spelled out by many others commenting on this odd flick. My take on reviewing is to attempt interpreting what the director was trying to tell us. While the movie itself has a number of flat sequences, there are enough shock sequences to keep you awake in the latter moments of the enterprise.The opening sequence is simply a foreshadowing of what would occur later. Charles Dickens did this in ""A Tale of Two Cities"" when a cask of wine is broken in a Parisian street. The wine is blood, soon to be spilled. The killing of the coyote, seen before the titles, is simply something that will come around again by the end of the movie.There is a fair amount of thinly- veiled religious imagery as well. The lead character looks pretty much like the Sunday school Jesus, who's forced to take part in a ""last supper"". There are any number of such ""forshadowing"" elements seen here. The color red. The lighting of the lantern. The knife in the red velvet cake. The vapid LA characters seem to be a microcosm of the brainless and easily led new-age hipster drones. The party guests just accept the weird behavior of the hosts, based on a friendship that's a couple of years dead. It's not too hard to see where the movie is going, once ""The Invitation"" is revealed on a laptop for the guests' amusement...or conversion.Taken in entirety, ""The Invitation"" is an interesting observation on a number of levels. Obsessive behavior fueled by money. Damaged people giving up to some charlatan guru in the Est fashion. The cross-section of attendees at the dinner party wasn't random, rather, it was an attempt to show a PC ideal of millennials that occupy the Hollywood hills. Some Manson, some Jim Jones, some ""self help"" pop psychology, and the inevitable arc of useless, lost souls in the Heaven's Gate mode. Death is never pretty, no matter who tells you it is. This isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. Perhaps the mirror it holds up doesn't reflect what the viewer wants to see? Despite it's slow pace, ""The Invitation"" actually succeeds in a vision of dread.",The Invitation

Before you read any farther, I'm going to let you know I really, really recommend this movie. I watch and read lots of mysteries, suspense, and thrillers, and often figure out what will happen next. Or in the case of mysteries, I'll figure out who the killer is early on. That was not the case with this movie. I kept guessing what was going to happen next, and was surprised almost every time because something else happened instead.This movie did progress slowly, but to me it didn't matter because I was anxious to see what would happen next. I really enjoyed that the main character, Will, kept observing and questioning things that were happening. For example, one of the hosts locked the front door, and Will instantly inquired as to why. I thought this was a wonderful example how in society, just to be polite and not make waves, people will often let things go that they really should be reacting to.After you watch this one, I would love to know what you have to think.

This actor did a stellar job in this role and I was reminded of myself- every decision he made I felt as though it was one I would make, he is headstrong and decisive. A standout performance from this actor. The story is ""predictable"" in the best way, it continually makes you doubt yourself but forces you to acknowledge the evidence and trust your instinct, just as Will does. The entire cast resembles a familiar friend group to most viewers I'm sure, making this quite relatable throughout. The way the actors consistently convinced each other everything is ok is a wonderful example of cognitive disonence within a group. The tension within is constant and heartbreaking at times, leaving me absolutely engaged.This movie is so much more than it's ending, which holds a nice little kick at the very end.

This fell in to that category.The characters felt flat and boring, and I really didn't believe that all these people were friends. They just seemed so awkward around each other. No ones relationship was explained very well or how any of these people knew each other. There's also too many tropes and clichés in this. Any time John Carrol Lynch is in a film, it always turns out that he's the bad guy, which is a dead giveaway. I don't like knowing exactly what is about to happen in any movie. Additionally the backstory is told in a really predictable and bland flashback format already done in every single movie before. Also there's he trope that in every thriller, there's a scene where the male lead goes to the bathroom, splashes water in his face and stares in the mirror intensely for 30 seconds. In the end, this could have been much better. The majority of the film was really boring. I don't like waiting for the last 20 minutes for things to actually happen.

150,afrodome,An Intoxicating Thriller. Incredible.,10,15 August 2017,"Sometimes I cannot understand the dissonance between me and a great number of movie reviewers on this page. I had not seen any trailers of the sort because I didn't want to preview parts that may spoil he movie. With that said, I'm so glad I watched this film. This ranks with Green Room as a real edge-of-your-seat kind of movie but for entirely different reasons. While Green Room is just a unhinged speed chase offroad in complete darkness, leaving you dizzy with blurting holy sh't every 10 seconds, The Invitation takes it's time while not letting the story flatline. The use of ominous shots and reverberating violins really give you that sense of unease.The buildup, the paranoia, the character-structuring, the heavy atmosphere all build up to a short and worthy second half of the film.Honestly, it's frustrating to see so many people give this movie a criminally low rating because 'nothing happens'? Was I watching the same movie? Because what I saw building up to the climax was some of the most gorgeous shots with very grounded characters that immersed me into the story. People react to a movie that they were expecting and it wasn't, so they rate it a 1. Really? This is a quality thriller that I recommend everyone check out.",The Invitation
151,yourfavoritecritic,"A Solid, Self-Contained Thriller",6,31 March 2021,"The Invitation is directed by Karyn Kusama and is written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. The film stars Logan Marshall-Green, Michael Huisman and Tammy Blanchard, among others. The Invitation tells the story of a couple attending a dinner party of the boyfriend's ex, however, things are not as they seem and old drama creates new turmoil. Released throughout 2015, The Invitation did not get a mainstream limited release until 2016 where it was met with fairly positive reception from audiences and critics alike.I knew nothing about The Invitation going into it, so with my expectations relatively low, I was pleasantly surprised by the end result. The Invitation is a slow-burn thriller that knows how to build suspense and question the protagonist's intuition. The entire film, apart from the opening five minutes, is spent at one location with much of the film almost feeling like a theatre play and that's not a bad thing as I have enjoyed films that are relatively contained. The Invitation is a very character-driven film and the filmmakers did a good job at casting Logan Marshall-Green as Will. Although Will isn't exactly the most exciting character, it's clear that he's gone through some sort of trauma which builds intrigue with the viewer, on top of being a good straight man as given the circumstances in the movie Will represents the thoughts of the audience and rarely makes a dumb a decision.The Invitation is a well-written story, even despite its predictable moments and kind of knowing where the climax was going to lead to, I was still entertained by the film however it is not without its faults. The execution at times almost felt amateurish, particularly during flashback scenes or when Will was in his head about certain things; I felt that those moments were not edited the best and almost felt heavy-handed with its themes. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but it certainly distracted me at times while watching the movie.In summation, The Invitation is a decent enough thriller that is certain to entertain those who check it out. While the story is well written, it's not going to be something that will blow anyone away with many moments that will feel a tad predictable; the end concept and how the movie gets to that point will surely be enjoyable. Clocking in at an hour and forty minutes, The Invitation is a rather slow film that takes time setting itself up and while the run time might be felt in certain spots there is always something going on that will intrigue the viewer. While I did enjoy The Invitation, for the most part, I also recognize it wasn't something that I truly loved, despite that, I can still recommend this film to most people. If the idea of a thriller that takes it times to set up and has moments that will make you question the reasoning of the protagonist as well as yourself, sounds good to you then definitely check this film out. For everything that The Invitation did well, there were also aspects that held this film back from being something truly great and for that reason, I am giving The Invitation a 6/10.",The Invitation
152,Larsii90,"Great premise, bad execution",5,25 April 2016,"It is very apparent that this is an independent indie film, because it is not a typical thriller (like I hoped it would be). One of the first words I can say is boring, and pretty predictable. They spend so much time building up the movie, and just a little time with what we were looking for: chase scenes, interesting killing and so on. It is an interesting and creepy premise, and a great twist at the end, but the execution was overall bad, and very boring. Wish they spent half the time building it all up, and the rest following the ""normal"" friends where they tried to escape. Would have been so much more interesting.",The Invitation
153,vandeman-scott,"Dizzying, suspenseful, thought provoking",7,10 June 2021,"""The Invitation"" is a tense, engaging film that seems far shorter than its 100-minute running time. After seeing Æon Flux, I was predisposed to watch another film directed by Karyn Kusama, and I wasn't disappointed. With ""The Invitation,"" she has directed a dizzying, psychological drama that is both suspenseful and thought provoking.The disturbing atmosphere and pervasive sense of dread that are hallmarks of ""The Invitation"" are established early on. Will and Kira have received a formal invitation to a party at the home Will and his ex-wife formerly shared, and out of a sense of social obligation, they are attending. On the way, Will hits a coyote and has to euthanize it with a tire iron. His revulsion is a revealing introduction to his character and a heck of a way to start both a movie and an evening out. What follows is a deeply uncomfortable study in going along to get along that the viewer knows will have to end poorly.The principal actors all proffer good performances, especially Logan Marshall-Green, who does outstanding work in the lead role. Michiel Hulsman and Tammy Blanchard, both sporting the look of crazy, expertly ramp up the ick factor as ex-wife/paramour and cult recruiters. Also noteworthy: Lindsay Burdge and John Carroll Lynch as malevolent whack jobs are slightly over the top, but they do a superb job of making you hate both their characters and cults in general, which is their razon de etra.While the entire cast's acting is never worse than competent, the top of the bill still compensates for lesser performances. A few of the characters have so little to do that they might as well have been absent. They're cardboard cutouts that are barely needed, even to move the narrative along. It's a flaw, but as flaws go, a minor one that doesn't confuse the story.The plot doesn't offer many surprises; as viewers, we're kept fully informed from the beginning. When Will and Kira enter the beautiful house overlooking downtown Los Angeles, nothing feels right. When their hosts lock themselves and their guests inside with the explanation that there have been recent home invasions, we know it's creepy. The screening of a video with obvious cult overtones and an awkward ""truth game"" rife with overt sexual come-ons continue to ramp up the tension. As a result, Will's anxiety grows, and ours grows along with it, and while other guests dismiss Will's apprehension as the emotional machinations of a grieving father, we know something bad is going to happen.""The Invitation"" also is not without its messages, exploring societal issues Americans have been grappling with in earnest for about a decade. Is the claim of ""offense"" by social bullies such an overwhelming power play that people will ignore their fight or flight instincts rather than be perceived as giving it? Is the need for peer approval so strong that we will set aside our own sensitivities and allow ourselves to be coerced into compliance? Is groupthink so potent that it can compel us to act against our own better judgment and best interests, even to the point of self harm? These questions are never fully answered, but the implications are worrisome.As Kusama continues to turn the screw and the plot lurches toward it's inevitable conclusion, we are confronted with a final twist that, while unexpected, is not particularly original. Nevertheless, loose ends are mostly tied up and you won't feel cheated, even though you'll likely have a sense all along of where the whole affair is heading.Ultimately, ""The Invitation"" is an entertaining movie that, while imperfect, is a solid effort and a fine vehicle for escaping a crappy week at work. Enjoy it.I insist.",The Invitation

155,troy-boulton,Ultimate dinner party deterrent.,8,9 February 2020,"This tautly constructed thriller manages a continual slow-burn build-up of unease, knowing just how to twist and grate, and when to throw in the odd jolt, to keep you from settling into a dinner-party comfort zone as the narrative sails its course through various dinner-party ups and downs to a decisively delivered final act.You will throughout the film find yourself yelling at the well-crafted characters, at times telling them to chill, and at other times imploring them to exit the dinner party, only to find yourself suddenly second guessing your instincts, as the characters' journey becomes your own. The director gives you space to see the lead protagonist's interactions with many of his friends, but doesn't allow you an objective view of events - your experience of his fractured night is subjective, and thus veiled by potentially distorting emotional baggage and mistrust. The world the director builds feels complex and textured, yet also claustrophobic and unsettling. Your inability to step back and see events in a broader context is the same constraint experienced by the key characters. This is masterful film making at work.This film has been blessed with a layered and nuanced attention to detail. Smart choices in classic mid-century modern architecture and interiors ensure a sense of warm familiarity - even if you don't hold dinner parties yourself, the voyeuristic shots of hushed conversations and personal moments through gaps in dark-wood doors should trigger childhood memories of being in orbit of similar soirées. Part of your brain is telling you that you should be comfortable in this plush setting, yet we are never allowed to settle into a comfortable corner. The director denies us a coherent mental map of the home that acts as the universe in which this tale unfolds; every location feels subtly isolated, building on the sense that there is more to this night than meets the eye, always something hidden off camera or around a corner. Camera angles and framing ensure we are gently pummelled by shots showing stairs and doors that lead to dark, mysterious nooks and crannies, or views from high or low positions where we are unable to relax. Is everything what it seems to be? Your thoughts and wishes regarding this will evolve as the film progresses.Well worth a watch.",The Invitation

162,arminhage,"Boring and flat with worst character development I've seen in years ""SPOILERS""",2,20 September 2016,"Thanks to David Lynch and movies like Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway, Houses in Hollywood and Beverly Hills are somehow magical for the audience who never lived in LA, I lived there and there is no magic in reality, at least for 99% of the residents but still I like to see movies made in those houses on top of the hill, forcing myself to imagine always something sinister and odd going on inside. Like Time Travel, Black Holes and Unfaithfulness, it's one of those ever popular subjects that you rewrite the same story with slight variations over and over again and people still love to watch them. I call this movie an unsuccessful tap into an ever popular concept. Odd people living in a mansion in magical Hollywood are up to something sinister. Movie opens good with the Coyote accident (which has nothing to do with the main story) and then falls flat, I mean completely flat. The couple go to a reunion and for almost an hour, nothing happens! Technically, their greetings last for an hour! After an hour, suspicion begins. The main character can be suspicious because he is invited to his ex home where his ex is living with her new husband. I wouldn't accept such invitation specially with my girlfriend but if I agree, I would be suspicious of their true intentions but even with 100 clues, I would never dream of my ex and her husband, planned to kill all guests so the movie has logic problem. It's boring, it doesn't make sense and even when the plan is revealed and some action and killings happen, it doesn't move the audience.I had no sympathy with the agonist and any of the antagonists. They were strangers with no clear background and they remained strangers. I didn't care if any of them lived or died, so character development was another big blow. Provided with all that mentioned, the magic of the mansion on hill was also ruined! Movie was low budget with no notable cast so getting it into production does not surprise me.

It's like he couldn't wait to get into character (which should happen 30mins in) so he decided to call it in and be suspicious of his ex-wife acting so pleasant. The guests seem to share equal dumbness where they thought nothing of the host suspiciously locking the doors and having their windows barred in the same manner as the state prison.Will happens to wander mysteriously in and out of the house and each time he is caught, the person pretends it's nothing and asks him to join them back to the ""party"" where everyone seemed to have drank from the Kool-Aid.

170,ed-503-465183,Not your typical horror movie.,5,6 January 2020,"The first hour and fifteen minutes are like going up the first hill on a roller-coaster. The writer and director take advantage of the fact that you're expecting a horror movie. So play on that fact with a slow burn letting your anticipation build.But then you go over the top of that first hill, and there are about 15 minutes of action and a quick resolution. After the credits rolled, I was left feeling that the buildup just wasn't really worth the ride.It's not really a horror film, and it's not really thrilling. It's just meh. There's not a lot of blood and gore, there's not a lot of action, nor is there a lot of scares. Maybe I'd call it a weird and creepy drama with some murder involved. I thought the actors did a pretty good job, and I think the story had some potential. I think the pacing was off. I think the first act was way too long. It took up almost the entire movie. The second and third acts were only about 15 minutes long. I will say this; I was more interested in what was happening right before the credits rolled than anything else in this movie.I think the writer and director could have cut a good 30-40 minutes out of the first act, made the second act a little more thrilling, and maybe brought into the story a little more of what was going on with the red lanterns across LA.

172,rsj624,I Invite You to Pass on You're Invitation,5,30 July 2016,"I have not written a review on here in quite sometime, but after watching this film I felt the need to voice out a bit on some thoughts I've had regarding it. First and foremost, I am a huge fan of how horror films are being more legitimized in the last few years and look forward to the merging of more art meaningful stories in creepy and freak out narratives. So this is in no way written with a bias against this genre of cinema, however, when I feel a film is being granted as much praise as this one is and it isn't, in my opinion, quite deserving of it... it's time for some criticism.The Invitation centers around a group of friends who have long since gone their own ways, some due to a tragedy; others just life happenings, meeting up for a reunion of sorts at the house of our main Will and former wife Eden. Will brings his girlfriend Kira with him to the gathering where said friends act all kinds of polite, while try to reconnect and avoid addressing the elephant in the room. Will senses something very off about his ex-wife's new man David and that elephant begins to rear its head more and more as the film paves a path towards it's climactic ending.Without giving too much away at this time, The Invitation is worth it for about the last minute, if that is too much spoiler for you than I apologize, but it almost feels like it is inviting you to a challenge of sorts; a ""how much of a slow burn can you tolerate"" challenge. With that being said, slow burn films can be amazing, especially in the horror genre. Other horror films like The Witch, or artistic films like Upstream Color, even Primer are perfect examples of low key slow burn films that deliver on their concepts and stories. But The Invitation just keep dragging you along for a ride that you know is going to go south at some point, just at what point? This is so much so that eventually you start thinking to yourself that whatever place it arrives at cannot possibly satisfy enough due to how long it takes to get there.**Potential spoilers** Further harm is done when the emotional pull of the film, mostly regarding a tragic event in the former married life of Will and Eden, is seemingly overshadowed and rendered practically moot by the films third act. To some I guess it all can serve as a way to bottom line the films theme of failure to cope with loss, but everything that ultimately happens at this party will be a far worse loss, with far worse memories gained for everyone involved. No one wouldn't require a massive amount of therapy afterwards. **Actual spoilers** Also, David, again, that new boyfriend dude of Eden, has never met any of these friends of hers beforehand. He is sided with his own group of friends that also don't know anyone prior to their meeting. Choosing their roles to be that of the outsiders makes their involvement in the films big scene take everything to such a clichéd old-school horror level that it bails completely on it's own potential. What do I mean by this? How about it would've been so much more gut-retching and gushing with emotion if this was friends against friends with layered characters and multiple arcs. Histories and agendas that have something to gain and lose from it all? It really blows a chance at something revolutionary in horror cinema in favor of a more accessible and clichéd final act all for the sake of sticking to a much more grounded and less complicated set of themes. **end spoilers**In closing, if you are okay with being dragged for a long ride that pays off at the very very very very end, then by all means watch this movie. It's not horrible, it just doesn't strike me as a film that deserves a lot of the praise it is being given. You have better artsy horror film choices out there in It Follows, The Conjuring, Beyond the Black Rainbow, The Babadook, The Witch, even You're Next.

179,HorrorFreak1997,"well structured, intense and character driven",10,13 September 2016,"The Invitation (2015) directed by Karyn Kusama and written by the team of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi is an instant classic. written with structure and restraint and directed with elegance, this is a real slow burner of a horror mystery. this film is very well crafted and an extremely refreshing tale, in a time where found footage horror and jump scares flood the market without shame. the director Karyn Kusama most recently directed Jennifer's body in 2009 which was a mediocre effort at best, but also previously directed the messy sci-fi action film Aeon Flux in the year 2005 and the excellent girlfight in the year 2000. so by looking at her resume we have one good film, one mediocre film and one terrible film. so expectations were low going into The Invitation. regardless of expectations though this film achieves everything it needed to and more. by doing so it also put Kusama back on the map as a director that should be held in high regard.starring Logan Marshall-Green, Emayatzy Corinealdi, and Michiel Huisman the film tells the story of a couple who are invited to a dinner party by some old friends. the evening ends up being something far more sinister and evil than they could have ever imagined. the script is written with a lot of depth and a few very prominent thematic elements. these elements being the power of grief and negativity, the fear of death, and finding happiness. each of the main characters are all written with depth and their inner struggles contribute to the plot in an essential way in the context of the narrative. I spoke of restraint earlier in the review in terms of the writing. by this I am referring mostly to the backstory of our main character Will played by Logan Marshall-Green. for the majority of the film the director chooses to put us in his shoes and utilizes expository visuals and flashbacks to communicate his backstory. this is done with true mastery and really adds to the realism and psychological torture of the character. the relationship between Will and Eden (played by Tammy Blanchard) is excellent and acts as a pivotal plot point that's used to develop the narrative and strengthen the theme and tone of the film. the true beauty of the script is that it's so character driven and grounded in realism. it chooses not to take the easy way out by using silly and unrealistic means to develop the plot. instead it uses the emotional and physical interactions of it's characters to propel the plot forward while keeping it grounded in realism and genuine mystery. not a singular scene is wasted, each scene is essential is providing the viewer with a good sense of who each character is and making their motivations seem real and genuine. Will acts as almost a detective, he (like the viewer) senses something strange about the situation and does his best to search for clues to try and stop what he senses is coming all the while discovering something about himself that he may not have fully been able to come to terms with. his own grief. just as you think Will has everything figured out and he's caught the hosts in the act the script comes in and throws another curve ball at you and ups the suspense another notch until it becomes unbearable. while the movie tries its best to develop Will mostly, it still manages to develop his ex wife Eden quite a bit as well. not every single character gets as much time to develop as Will and Eden but as I have already mentioned they all have their own motives that are grounded in reality, which adds up to a totally cohesive and immersive character driven horror mystery. there's a scene where the guests all sit down and play a game where they all say something they want. this gives the character of Pruitt played by John Carroll Lynch a chance to deliver a haunting and unnerving monologue that involves his relationship with his wife. what a scene this was. it's rare that a scene becomes as captivating as that one. all of the acting is also great. from both the supporting cast as well as the leads. many if not all of our actors are capable of showing believable emotions without even speaking. many scenes involve heavy amounts of dialogue and each interaction is written very well with some excellent and suspenseful direction.the suspense in the film is not your traditional style of suspense that you would expect from a horror film. while yes near the end of the movie we do get some of that traditional cat and mouse intense suspense, for most of the movie the suspense stems from the excellently written, wonderfully paced slow burning mystery and the unpredictability of the subject matter within the dialogue heavy scenes. one minute the guests are all laughing and carrying on the next minute, within the same scene we get a subtle tonal shift into something dark and serious and thought provoking. on top of all of this the direction is nothing short of amazing. slow tension building close up shots that immerse you into the dark and unnerving stories being told. still shots with the right things left totally out of frame until the perfect moment to get full effectiveness out of the scene. hallway shots with excellent lighting to create distance and atmosphere. I can go on and on. the film also has a wonderful and mesmerizing score that creates even more tension and atmosphere. the ending was also great. suspenseful, thrilling, horrifying and perfect.the verdict: 10/10",The Invitation

In a perfect world you read no further and trust that 'The Invitation' is a low budget thriller with a third act that makes your investment in the slow first 2 acts worthwhile. But if you, like me, have a hard time going in completely blind...read on.THE PREMISEWill (Logan Marshall Green from Prometheus and Upgrade) and his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) agree to attend a dinner party thrown by his ex-wife Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her new boyfriend David (Michiel Huisman from The Haunting of Hill House, most recently the boyfriend/murder victim from The Flight Attendant and a dozen other water cooler shows you've watched in the last 5 years). Will and Eden's marriage didn't survive the trauma of their son's death and they each dealt with their pain in different ways; Will internalized it and spiraled into a disheveled mess he hasn't fully recovered from and Eden joined a bereavement group and disappeared for a few years.SPOILERSEden has now emerged from her sabbatical, in Mexico it turns out, with a new spirituality about her, some new friends and seemingly cured of her grief. The gathering appears to be a means of reconnecting with Will, several of their mutual friends and introducing them to her new friends but as we slowly learn throughout the first half of the movie, the bereavement group is really a new age cult, 'The Invitation', and the dinner party may be a recruiting event or something even more nefarious. As the night goes on Will becomes increasingly suspicious of Eden and her new friends' intentions. The newcomers are unsettling in their own right... Sadie (Lindsey Burdge) is overly flirtatious and Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch) reveals he served prison time for killing his wife...whom he misses dearly. Will's friends and even his girlfriend, try to convince him he is being paranoid but why DID David lock the front door with an inside key, why DOES he feel like they are being plied with expensive wine, who WERE the strangers at the front door and why DID Eden and David try so hard to keep their friend Claire from leaving the party early?The whole charade finally blows up when Will notices the final round of wine is not being poured from a fresh bottle. He suspects poison and smacks the wine glasses from everyone's hands. All pretense gone, Sadie begins to stab the guests as David and Pruitt try to shoot them. Will and Kira escape the dining room and cat & mouse around the house as they look for ways to escape. They ultimately survive by disarming Pruitt and stabbing David. Eden, in a fit of guilt for dragging her friends into terror, shoots herself. The final shot of the film, which I absolutely will not reveal, is a doozy.Director Karyn Kusama tells a story with a frenzied third act that rewards the patient audience. While I enjoyed the movie, I found the script to be something of a paradox; it handles some complicated themes well but some basic tenets seem to be fumbled. The screenplay aptly mines concepts of when does being a supportive friend turn into being an enabler, when is it time to stop being polite for the group and leave a personally uncomfortable situation and it competently turns an awkward social gathering into Will's ballooning paranoia, yet it stumbles with cheesy and simplistic character introductions. There are enough little clues through the script, such as the thick card-stock party invitation, the locked door, the lost strangers at the door or the red lantern to keep you invested but the opening scene, where Will accidentally hits a coyote with his car and euthanizes it with a crowbar is irrelevant to the rest of the movie... it doesn't provide any information about plot or character that we can't get other places. The second act, an opportunity to learn more about all the houseguests and make them relevant, is wasted on some filler dialogue that teeters on boredom and they end up feeling more disposable than integral to the plot. The played out plot trope of 'truth or dare' is retooled as the self empowering 'I want' and provides important information about Sadie and Pruitt but girlfriend Kira is a completely wasted character and almost disappears in the movie. You could almost argue that if Will arrived without a girlfriend it would better indicate he is still grief torn for the loss of his son.Screenplay strengths and weaknesses aside I was impressed with some of the cinematography. Someone made a smart decision to switch to natural lighting for the final scenes and the change of atmosphere enhanced the final act.In the end Kusama combined all of the above to give us an enjoyable, albeit slow burn, thriller that teaches us all over again, you can't dismiss ANY cult and maybe teach us a new lesson that people will go to almost any means out of desperation to end pain, even if it's only of the emotional variety.7 stars.",The Invitation

189,bobhartshorn,California Screaming!,10,8 April 2016,"Where the hell did this one come from?? –The best, as they often say, is saved 'til last and that certainly proved to be the case when I caught Sunday night closer The Invitation at the 2015 Mayhem Film Festival in Nottingham UK six months ago. It was one of those rare occasions when a movie proves to be so creepily flesh crawlingly disturbing, that your levels of stress rise to the degree where you want to climb into the screen and scream ""Make it stop! Make it stop!"" It certainly did for me!Opening with a turbulent car journey, the story introduces us to invitees Will (Logan Marshall Green) and his partner Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi), arriving at his former home in the Hollywood hills. He is gathered with a group of old chums for an evening of fine cuisine and claret on tap hosted by his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard) and her slimy new beau, David (Michiel Huisman). Anxiety prevails and the atmosphere is still thick with fallout from the 'event' that drove Will and Eden apart.The hosts' have a couple of freaky new friends in attendance too, both of whom add ill-fitting girth to a conversation of new-age enlightenment born from Eden and David's explanation for their two year absence. Tremors of discomfort occur, not least from Will, who strongly begins to suspect his ex-Mrs and her creepy new fancy bit might be up to no good, harbouring sinister intentions for their guests. But as there is evidence to suggest Will may not have his mental faculties in order, his questionable grip on reality may be inducing paranoid delusions of the worst kind...Directing from a faultlessly constructed screenplay by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, helmer Karyn Kusama's very modern day Californian horror yarn plays like a riff on Brian Yuzna's Society gate crashing The Big Chill (albeit with a better soundtrack), locking the audience into a swirling, dreamy toxic whirlpool of wobbly social etiquette versus let's-get-the-hell-out-of-here stigma that will keep you guessing which way it will fall from the first to last.The foundations of the story are built solidly on tragic events of the past and how the different paths people take to cope with personal trauma can lead to not necessarily opting for the best route home. There's also room for subtly humorous social commentary too, bravely poking fun at the money laundering spiritually guided pursuits of rich & gullible desperados residing in CA's tackiest resort. We see a landscape still terrorised by the odious spectres of Manson Family home invasions and Applewhite charlatan mantras casting long dark shadows across the backyard swimming pools and sun-bed patios. All of this is backdrop gravy however, and Kusama is sure never to let it drown out the supper's baton passing queasy mystery-drama into full blown thriller/horror trajectory.Cast iron control is wielded on the twelve strong cast too: the actors may get varying degrees of screen time, but every single character will, at some point, have your full undivided attention. Standouts John Carroll Lynch and Lindsay Burdge as Eden & David's brand new besties, Pruitt and Sadie respectively, will have you writhing in your chair with profound uneasiness, and Corinealdi as 'trophy wife' Kira, blows expectation out of the water when, with immaculate timing, Kusama finally lets her bolt from the stable.But it's Logan Green as Will who really gets under your skin. After vapid fare such as Devil and the disappointing Prometheus, he momentarily looked cursed with a 'We couldn't get Tom Hardy' millstone round his neck, doomed to a career clearing up in third rate fodder passed over by his thespian 'twin'. Not a chance. Coiffured in a 70's style Jesus locks & beard combo, he resembles a young, lean incarnation of The Big Lebowksi's Dude, going the whole distance with a performance worthy of Bridges at his haunted, brilliantly despondent best.And then there's Kusama. Up until now her slim CV - consisting of the acclaimed but forgotten Girlfight, and the unfairly maligned Aeon Flux and Jennifer's Body - had hardly set the world on fire. But she finally delivers on her initial promise with a muscular, mature and expertly nuanced piece of work that, if there's any justice in this sorry little world, will rightly escalate her profile into the ranks of the A- List.Her draw of influences is to be highly commended too where a recent interview had the director citing 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers as being at the forefront. The nervy edginess & unearthly autumnal lighting of Phillip Kaufman's remake is perfectly recaptured in texture & tone, not least with Will's explorations of his old residence (courtesy of production designer Almitra Corey's trippy & treacherous interiors) as he spies through door cracks and windows to be frustratingly denied the incriminating evidence he so desperately seeks. This beautifully mirrors Brooke Adams' similar detective antics in IOTBS as she surveys the in clandestine activities of her duplicated pod person fiancée.And just like Kaufman's undervalued masterpiece, Kusama reveals her Ace trump mere moments before the end credits roll with a final reveal outrageous and terrifying enough to freeze the blood, savvily hitting the satirical, lunatic heights of Network and Fight Club's most Iconic beats on its way. This one's a night to remember.Thought-provoking and powerful, The Invitation is a modern day master class in the art of suspense building and an instant classic that deserves to be seen in the cinema on a big screen.

190,phaylen,"A slow, but refined film",4,8 April 2016,"Rarely does a film come along and make the viewer ask themselves ""Did I like that, or did I just lose 100 minutes I'll never get back?""The Invitation was that film for me. I almost turned it off. After 30 minute, then an hour and STILL nothing at all happened and it just seemed as if the film were not progressing at all, but just awkwardly bouncing around anxiously like a tin pan in a washing machine. But I hung in there, checking my phone occasionally, until things finally started to happen, there was something actually going on at an hour and 20 minutes in. Some call films like this a slow burn, others call them boring. The Invitation was neither, because while the pacing is super slow, a lot of factors save this movie from going right in the bin. First and foremost, the acting is exquisite. This film would not be half of what it is without the stellar performances of Logan Marshall-Greene and Emayatzy Corinealdi. The cinematography is beautiful, lit spectacularly to maintain the tone of the entire film.It's a thought provoking film that sometimes takes itself too seriously. Sometimes you're not sure if it's a jaunt through Valley of The Dolls or a Manson-esque dramatization. I think the biggest fault with the film was the fact it is a really a small, simple story that the writers take far too long to tell and then wind it all up in the last 20 minutes. That's not to say the film is not an intelligent examination of many facets of the human condition, and it's done so with a distinct sensitivity and grace that director Karyn Kusama should be lauded for. This is a film for the very patient.",The Invitation

Let's see: it lasts 100 minutes, and for the first 80 or 85, nothing happens. Yes there is a sick and eerie atmosphere, you can sometimes feel the tension, but where are the facts? The happenings? The actions? The events? There's none of it, just a weird, never-ending situation where people who clearly haven't got anything more to do with each other since long are forced back together in the creepiest and most improbable party ever. There's a lot of talking, situations that would scare away any sane person just don't bother anyone except the protagonist (not even his insensitive girlfriend), and you just keep watching and watching wondering where it all is heading to. You finally get to know it in the last 15 minutes. And believe me, it's nothing shocking nor surprising. The conclusion is slapdash, 15 minutes and from the supposedly ""big"" revelation it's all done.And I will spare you a commentary on the last 30 seconds, the worst possible cherry on top.So, conclusion: this film lacks substance in every single aspect: story, developing of the story, characters, acting, catch on the spectator. There's also a couple of plot holes, or anyway ""unfinished"" situations. What exactly happened to the boy? We learn he died, but no circumstance is given on the various flashbacks, they just stop and end one moment before the event. And what really happens with the only person who leaves the party in advance? We are hinted that something might have happened to her, but we are never told. Sorry no, nothing works here.

Normally the cinematography drastically outpaces the story with these types of thrillers, but it wasn't at all the case here. The writing was outstanding-I loved how the host characters subtly ran over social boundaries, from the minute our hero walks into the house. This movie actually affected me personally. As a teenager I was semi involved in a cult- they were trying to recruit me anyways. Fortunately I got out before anything happened, but there's definitely an eerie energy to cult types. It was shocking and unsettling to me how well these filmmakers nailed the creepiness and condescension of people like that, from the weird ""talks"" about being ""distant"" to showing their dinner guests a video of a woman dying before everyone even had dinner! And of course, there's the strange aggressive slutty girl who is always around groups like this. I loved that the hero Will was appropriately reacting to all of these inappropriate things. The climax was amazing and had my heart rate jacked. I loved the life affirming things Will said in those moments though. As I said, I watched this last night. I actually had a nightmare about being at this house. All morning I keep thinking about those terrifying red lamps all over the hills, and the sounds of violence.

Acting is good, music is creepy like it should be, everything works great and it feels like it's gonna be a breathtaking movie. So this part deserves 8/10. Second part is a typical slasher, nothing to be said here except that it really ruined the impression made by the first part, it feels completely out of place and even from a gore horror point of view it's not a very good slasher really, 1/10.

One reviewer said there was one twist after another and the final twist at the end was wonderful. I didn't see it that way. Eden is all crazy delusional happy, so I figured she was going to unhinge herself. Then the cult video and sermon. Oh, just so that we might catch on, Eden and her new husband has a crazy housemate straight out of Helter Skelter, and just to ram it into our skulls her name was Sadie, which was Susan Atkin's Manson Family nickname. Anyway, the movie started strangely where the protagonist Will hits a coyote driving to the dinner, and mercy kills it with a tire iron. I have no clue why that scene was even in the movie. So, they get there, no one really has any past except the Asian chick who was wild in college. Everyone else? Just random people that we know nothing about, and at least for me, care nothing about.The only reason why I give it 2 stars was because I watched it twice to try to see what I was missing the first time.

Why? I'm not sure. Maybe it was the clever way the film was shot, the camera angles that made otherwise normal situations seem otherworldly and foreboding. Maybe it was because it took far too long for the film to reach its climax. Maybe it was because I kept expecting it to be a little less bleak. Maybe it was the acting that somehow brought trope-laden and potentially flat characters to life. I don't know.The film's redeeming qualities were more in its design than its content. It is not a pleasant film. It is not an easy watch. It is quite thought-provoking, but only inasmuch as the subject matter already was before it was used in the film.Watch it for the acting, the cinematography, and the one redeeming twist at the end.

Really good, really suspenseful, keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Some nice twists as well!It could have been great, except for: 1. The dinner talk sounded phony. Not real. They should have actually gone to some real dinner parties and recorded the conversations to come up with something more realistic. Some of it was cringy.2. Will was too suspicious at the very beginning. From the moment he got there, he's always frowning, unhappy. He should have started out less suspicious and gradually built it up. He should have been more friendly and outgoing at the beginning. Of course, he's the hero so he needs to start getting more and more suspicious later.3. The talk of the cult leader didn't sound real, except the scene at the end. They should have researched some real cult leaders and maybe made a composite of them (Jim Jones, the Waco, Texas David Koresh, others). Other than that it was great, the suspense starts out slowly and builds up until you are sitting on the edge of your seat. Really good! Really fun and great ending. John Carroll Lynch as ""Pruit"" was especially good. Mysterious stranger, and you didn't like him from the start. He played it beautifully! I love actors that can really act, like he's a completely different person then when you see him in other movies. (Unlike, say, Clint Eastwood who pretty much just plays himself, doesn't even have to act...) If I had to vote for best actor, I would vote for John Carroll Lynch in this movie.

A gang of old friends, essentially a crew of largely narcissistic airheads as usual, gathers at a west coast manse to reflect not too deeply about their lives at the invitation only event. Love is in the air or is that the faint whiff of arsenic? The characters are minimally sketched out, mostly acting like giggling goofballs, yet there seems to be some vague sense of dread as if someone might break out a piñata filled with scorpions and venomous spiders. Our protagonist gets his vibes tingled in the nick of time, sniffs out the host's lethal serving up of a Jonestown inspired pousse-cafe' and the action kicks in ... finally. The ultra - violence mode is fairly suspenseful although as the participants expire, we care about the departure of some and others, not so much. Decent acting with a special note of Lindsay Burdge as "" Sadie "" in her compelling and genuinely disconcerting performance providing some threatening vitality to counter the fatuous party goers. John Carroll Lynch is fine as well in his understated portrayal of the psafe as psorghum psychopath. Menacing iconography in the form of mysterious helicopters and red lanterns suggest an intriguing backstory that may have merited more development but does add to the overall sinister tone of the story.

Half way through it I just found myself not caring what happen to these insipid people who didn't know the difference between a party and a therapy session. To me a party is a happy place, with laughter, dancing. No death films, or deep talks about the death of loved ones. It was more like a wake. I can stay home with my stuff and be happy instead of being in a room full of people who were weird. Even those they called friends didn't seem to have much of a likable personality.Now let me say this...if my ex invite me to anything he's throwing in the old domestic dwelling we called home, after I haven't heard or seen him in two years I wouldn't go. Period. Will knows his ex-wife well enough to know something is off with her which means something is off in general.So of course, no one wants to believe the man in the room who knows ll really well except for three people who are just weird in general and don't fit in. They wouldn't have come if it wasn't for the fact they all loved his ex-wife, who none had heard from in two years.Now as for the Black woman he brought with him and I'm telling you as a Black woman, if my man suggested we go party with his ex I would have said hell no especially if in the entire time we were dating he's never introduced me to not one person at the party before the party. I need to know at least one other person to feel comfortable about walking into the unknown. The unknown being a woman he loved very much once into a home he lived happily in with this woman until they lost a child. Also, if I see my man going through something in general I would have not allowed him to go through it alone and side with these people I didn't know.When he was upset and went the bathroom, I would have been there with him to make sure he was okay and tell him I was ready to go. By the times this character gets to that point, he thinks he's just going through things because of his son's death. So they badly wrote that character's reaction in the beginning because cultural upbringing matters. I figure it wasn't written with a Black woman in mind but they wanted diversity.One of the things I found most irritating is these cult people wanted to die why they felt the need to take others with them. They should have explained their reasoning and a bit far fetched that all of them would be in that same area of town in a large city.The only plus is the two leads were alive and their relationship stronger for it.

The Invitation, from the director Karyn Kusama, is one of these cases. The less information about the plot the public know the best will be the cinematographic experience. Will (Logan Marshall-Green) was married to Eden (Tammy Blanchard), but after the accidental death of their young son, they divorced and she went away without giving news. Two years later she returns to seek her ex-husband, inviting him and his girlfriend Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi) over for a reconciliation dinner, a reunion with the couple's old friends. Sadie (Lindsay Burdge) and Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch), unknown people to Will, are also present in the dinner. Accompanied by her new husband, David (Michiel Huisman), Eden is totally different from what she was before, awakening in Will the suspicion that the hosts have sinister plans against him.The Invitation offers the audience a story with slow pace, projecting drama, suspense and mystery, besides the touch of paranoia that turns out to whet the curiosity of the viewer. As the protagonist we feel increasingly uncomfortable, seeing bad omens everywhere. The house, the visitors and their attitudes begin to arouse doubts and queries.It is worth mentioning the great performances of the entire cast. Will (Logan Marshall-Green), unpredictable and suspicious to the level of almost become paranoid, Eden (Tammy Blanchard) with a melodramatic instinct, Sadie (Lindsay Burdge) extroverted, detached and wild and Pruitt (John Carroll Lynch), with a calm and very peculiar coldness.

228,que_no_me_toque_un_alto_delante,An intense experience,7,15 October 2015,"A powerful feature film. Despite some reminiscence (group of friends, dinner, the house atmosphere, colors) with ""Coherence"" is undoubtedly an original movie. A very interesting point made by the director (who had already done Girlfight and Jennifer's Body) over a possible processing of the pain of a loss, in a quite denying way, perhaps cynical, reaching extremes of aggressiveness. A lot of tension, making us doubt who you believe (or even what is real) at every step, until the crux of the matter comes; you may wait a little for that, but it's worth it. Point for the director for not using low blows. Worthwhile if you want to spend a very intense time. With regards to actors' work, ""Will"" comes out unscathed. ""Eden"" maybe a little artificial, but I think it is an intentional nuance given by the director. The rest comes off well. The screenplay is pretty good. Although it is not revolutionary, the pace is accurate, keeps the suspense, and plays with ambiguity.",The Invitation

Things don't seem right from the go, as the hosts behaviour seems to get stranger as time goes by and more details emerge of the two ex's trouble past. At the party are a number of other guests, none of which are particularly likable or interesting, but the film does an effective job in ramping up the tension. Unfortunately, I found the payoff pretty disappointing, but the build up towards it is smart and effective. The lead, Logan Marshall-Green, who I only remember from Prometheus (where he was shocking), is actually pretty good here, the rest of the cast are forgettable. Not the worst way to spend an hour and forty minutes, would recommend.",The Invitation
233,Suicide_Saint,Dreadful from beginning to end,2,31 July 2016,"Though some may argue the merit of the scene with the coyote as foreshadowing, it was nothing more than superfluous and uncomfortable. Once the protagonist and his girlfriend arrive at a get-together with old friends, it is painfully obvious that something is amiss. It does not take long for the incredulous cult theme to manifest due to the insane appearance and ramblings of the protagonist's ex-wife. The film drags on, attempting to create a mythos or intrigue surrounding ""The Invitation"" cult that the ex-wife and a few others discovered in Mexico. They proclaim this ""invitation"" alleviates all sentiments of pain, negativity, and suffering. After some red herring paranoia portrayed by the main character, the film finally reaches the predictable and incredibly dull climax emulating Jonestown in which the guests are served poison (albeit unknowingly to most).I'm certain all involved worked hard to try and produce something of which they could all be proud. However, ""The Invitation"" simply repeats the stereotypes associated with religious cults rather than bringing anything novel to the narrative.",The Invitation

Perfect creepy atmosphere and does not tell you where it will end until the last few scenes. What I found surprising is the way they built up the thrill where an uncomfortable dinner party turns into something completely different when one of the guests tells the story of how he murdered his own wife, for example. Some people wrote in their reviews that in the end the outcome was predictable but the main character could just as well be losing his own mind especially due to his past and how the memories of his dead son are all coming back with him being back in his old house with his old social circle. The end was really refreshing as A, the only brown person survived for once and B, there was actually a third person to survive instead of the usual lead role/main couple. Also very proud of my fellow countryman Michiel Huisman for such a wonderful role in where spoke English without anyone ever being able to tell he was born and raised in the Netherlands, way to go man!!Don't trust bad reviews on this one, either competition or just ignorant people who have yet to learn about movies or maybe never will ;)",The Invitation

To be totally honest I found it boring, drawn out and not particularly original.My first problem lay in the overall 'feel' of the movie - it just wasn't believable somehow. Any notion that something was about to take place was only weakened by not so great acting mixed with the constant thought of 'please let this be over soon'.Secondly (and perhaps my biggest gripe) is the fact that there are just too many lose ends. These people have supposedly been friends for years, but there's little if any chemistry on screen, so the cast almost become objects of little to no depth or real character. I found I really didn't care what happened to them in the end (or throughout for that meter).There was plenty of room for several great sub-plots to be created and introduced instead of flashbacks (which didn't really add much anyway); and none of which were incorporated or expanded upon - no twists or turns which could have really set the movie up for a great climax. Nope - none of that... Well - maybe a very small ""oh"" at the end... But it is a 'very' small one.I read that the movie was made with no real major backing, and after watching it, I'm afraid I can see why. Sadly (or perhaps luckily for some), it will be a film which will be easily forgotten.2/10",The Invitation

This is the kinda of movie that really have you think that people are people, are not people, but live very dark lives, and that, nothing is as it seems. This one blew me away. Even after realizing what this film was about, I was still taken aback of how the story unfolded. This movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. For mature audiences only.

The only and the biggest issue being that this movie is extremely predictable. It's almost like the toned down version of the movie Get Out. Except Get Out wasn't predictable at all. There's not a lot to review about this movie except you just go watch it. The Invitation only deserves 6 stars from me but the only reason I gave it a 7 was it's ending. The ending in my opinion was the perfect ending for a mystery movie. A big issue with horror/thriller/mystery movies nowadays is the delivery of the ending. I get that it being a mystery it's meant to be confusing. But most movies overdo it. However in The Invitation they do it just right.

Let's just say The Invitation provides some healthy perspective. But this was a great movie. The low score is somewhat baffling. Granted, if you're into, say, Captain Marvel - it's prolly not gonna be your bag. However, if you enjoy a nice, taught, emotionally charged experience then you definitely won't be disappointed.I had avoided it previously because it just sounded like a movie about the dinner party from hell and that was enough to provoke a meh but now I wish I'd drunk the koolaid sooner.The worst I can say is that the overall premise is rather unlikely? I don't know anyone who would attend this party given the circumstances but I also don't know anybody from California. But if you can take the slight ""movieland"" logic problems then it should be your new favorite thriller.Knew it was quality when John Carroll Lynch showed up and the multifaceted national treasure that is Toby Huss.

I'm a HUGE thriller buff, and this one is easily in my top 10. The Invitation takes its time in building up the delicious tension, and there is an impending sense of something very sinister approaching, even as the other guests repeatedly write off the tormented Will as just being paranoid.

The acting is excellent with special mention to the lead, Tom Hardy look-alike Logan Marshall-Green. How this guy isn't a much bigger name after a performance like this is a mystery to me. He's helped by a strong cast and very, very good performances from everyone. The suspense starts right at the beginning and continues to the final, satisfying climax. Personally, I loved the ending.

246,natekowalskitattoo,"I hated it, then gave it a chance and it pulled itself together!",7,10 April 2016,"I actually turned this movie off after the first half an hour. It had all the cliché characters you would expect at a movie party, the flirty whore, the well groomed gay couple, the shy blonde who just wants to cuddle and the couple who found new meaning to life after traveling the world....which is all fine but these people are supposed to be in their thirties.Maybe those party stereotypes would be realistic if they were in highschool. They even play highschool games similar to truth or dare and end up awkwardly making out with one another.Then after an hour and twenty minutes things get crazy and the movie actually becomes very urgent, tense and frighteningly believable.So after the first 30 minutes I skipped to the end, and I thought the ending was acted so well and the last scene was so well done that I had to go back and sit through the entire thing. Upon doing this the characters annoyed me less, because although they were extremely irritating and flirty and drunk they were well acted characters and they were believable. I guess that people like this must exist somewhere, and with such an insane ending I had to force myself through the build up.The main character also is acted really well and was not very annoying and actually acted realistically, it was refreshing to see the main character not just cry and run from his attackers, he fought back and refused to go down without a fight. He was also skeptical and sensed that something was wrong early on, which is so rare in horror movies, I really liked his outspoken accusations and tantrums.So in summary, if you can make it past the first thirty minutes the end is quite the payoff, and try not to be too annoyed by the supporting characters and just focus on the main couple.",The Invitation
247,gpride2009,Builds up for Nothing,3,15 April 2016,"First of all, movies like this should not be categorized as horror since it is a thriller at its best. There is a big difference between a thriller and a horror. Movies like 'The Exorcist', 'Paranormal Activity' are horror movies, whereas movies like 'Scream', 'Saw', 'Final Destination' are thrillers.Regarding 'The Invitation', the first 1 hour and 20 minutes just ""build up"" to what is coming next: 15 minutes of quick and easy deaths.It was very easy to predict what is the ""big and unexpected"" revelation or twist. The moment they played the video of the dying woman and you realize a cult is involved, it became obvious that a mass murder or suicide was the intention behind the invitation.I was expecting, or let me put it this way, it would have been much more dramatic if the characters were convinced to take their own lives. especially since it was mentioned that ""everyone has suffered from a loss"". The guy who showed up late for example, imagine that he had arrived 3 hours earlier for real and was convinced to take out his own life on video, and then the tape was played to his girlfriend, who thinks she has nothing to live for and was the first one to do it. I know this might sound a bit crazy, but I think it would have achieved a much better dramatic and intense outcome for viewers.The only surprising element was the ending when they realize that it was not only them in this situation.To sum up, the build up should have been much shorter and more suspenseful, and the last 20 minutes of the movie should have been more intense and better written and directed.",The Invitation

From the very beginning I was pulled into the story and the characters, couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I can't say enough about the actors, they made the characters come alive and you felt something for each of them and their situations. Tammy Blanchard was superb as Eden, the goddess of her own home. Michiel Huisman, as her new man, delivered a fantastic performance as he carefully balanced that line between good and evil. And Logan Marshall-Green made me feel his grief, even before I knew what he was grieving about. The rest of the cast is equally as good. Some of the best moments are between Huisman and Marshall-Green, like two alpha males posturing for the upper hand.This movie really makes you feel uncomfortable with its awkward dinner dialogue and questionable party games. Its a slow burn, but not as slow as I was expecting as the dinner party antics keep you engaged. I loved the pace - I could feel my tension grow and subside along with the scenes.

258,tedari,A slow burning invitation to creepy town,7,19 November 2016,"I will be honest, I liked this film. I'm a big fan of suspense thrillers and 'The Invitation' served its genre well. The movie is like creeping death, slowing moving, introducing new characters and unreeling plot line ever so carefully. There were some amazing moments of both cinematography, one in particular where dialogue between two female characters can be heard as they discuss the main protagonist as he moves through the gardens.I also enjoyed the creepy, suspenseful moments of the protagonist trying to work out what is going on at his former residence. Are his suspicions founded, or are the hosts really just wanting to bring his friend group closer together. The pace of the film, however, was a little too slow. It seemed to drag from time to time, and there were a number of red herrings that seemed to go absolutely nowhere. An incident involving a coyote at the beginning seems to serve no purpose in the plot, and character who turns up half way through the movie seems to arrive at such a convenient time. These are small issues, though. Once the suspense finally ends and the plot starts to unravel, you are left with a true sense of dread that would have made any horror movie worth watching. You really feel for the characters during the third act, and there are so many antagonists in the house, you genuinely feel they could be anywhere at any time. The ending was a little unsatisfactory. The number of people left standing at the end just seemed unnecessary with a loose end really sticking out like a sore thumb, and the final twist, although intriguing, begs more questions than provides answers. Like I said, I did like it. It had terrific acting, a steady plot, and it was set in one location which I always find interesting as the story needs to be super strong.Its main flaws could quite easily have been ironed out with a final draft, but it's definitely worth a watch.

262,andreideceu,Tense but,8,14 February 2021,"Good movie overall.
You can sense the awkwardness of the movie from the first scenes. This tends to be the norm as you move forward.
What once was a happy group of friends is torn apart by the tragedy that happened.
It expresses the dullability of those struck by intense and never ending pain (as losing a child affects a parent), and the distances one goes to try to erase that pain. But it never does.
For me, it was pretty predictable, because i have seen many movies/documentaries about cults and how can they mess with someones mind, eager to do anything it takes to give up that pain, instead of giving in.
On the other hand, as i have seen in other comments, its a situation exposed to such a degree, that you can imagine yourself being in that situation, maybe not as the protagonists, but as a random friend that happens to be there.
The odd characters (you will know who they are), are incredibly suspicious from the moment they appear which further makes the movie a tad predictable from my side. But that shouldnt be the case if you turn your brain off a bit. Thing is, movie is so intense you cant. Our brains are wired in such way we need to find the answers before given to us.
Nonetheless, the acting is sick ! From everyone. The plot gives in slowly to the viewer, painting a distorted picture for us to try and discover more in depth, great producing there. They did not give up more details than needed and the permanent idea of Will being mentally ill kind of overloads the scenes. Everything is pieced together so well, so realistic, its really breathtaking and lingers on you after the movie has ended.
This movie should be seen by many. We live in a world where pain occupies most of our lifes, and after watching the movie you would think that things like this might actually happen in real life.For sure a very good movie, well executed and very good acting.",The Invitation

264,turtlecroc,Incredibly bad,2,10 April 2016,"Oh my gosh... the handful of people who have written good reviews of this must be cast or crew of this movie. To summarize: lame direction, no musical soundtrack whatsoever until the last few minutes, and a nonexistent plot. Poor continuity too, i.e. amateurish, e.g. woman sets wine glass down on table, then cuts to another angle showing her still holding it. And now to the spoiler (which may not be a spoiler at all): There isn't even a hint of a plot for the first 45-50 minutes--it's just some friends sitting around a house talking. Boring stuff too, like: how are you? What have you been up to? Who cares?! So, I skipped ahead toward the end, and.... (spoiler).... lots of stabbing and killing. I did back it up and watch the movie through from where I left, and finally, mercifully, it ends--with a nonsensical, unoriginal scene that the producers undoubtedly thought was clever.The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is the vague anti-cult theme, but that's not even apparent until near the end, i.e. it isn't developed at all. But you do get to watch long videos--on a laptop screen--of some guy talking. Was that supposed to build tension..? I can't imagine.",The Invitation

It is demonstrating that in moral vacuums, in the ""anything goes"" era, anything can be justified in the name of one type of ""spiritualism"" or another.It is no longer the ""why?"" forming the moral predicate before action, but rather, the ""why not?"". So madam would like a reversal of the moral test, for satisfying an egocentric need for an after life on her own terms??? Why not!It is showing that in the permissive society, where egos shape their own virtues without reference to anything else, then mass murder can be justified on the basis of ""well, why not?"" --- and hence that is as superficial as it needs to be in this superficial age of ours.A genuine surprise with many strong performances.

There is nothing about him that makes you rot for him, i wouldn't care if he died ( which he sadly doesn't ) all the other people are much more fun to follow then him which makes me feel so disconnected to the guy.

The film is best viewed if one knows very little about the plot so let's just say it's about some people that get invited to a dinner party in LA. Of course, it is a thriller, so there is obviously more to it than that.It reminded me of a few other dinner party films: the Dogme '95 film the Celebration (1998) directed by Thomas Vinterberg, Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game (1939) and the contemporary film The Perfect Host (2010).This film is of course completely original, but definitely fits into the dinner-party-psychodrama category with the above mentioned. What impressed me about the Invitation was also the balance between intense interpersonal drama and tense psychological mind games.

Will was well portrayed as the brooding intense protagonist, with tragedy in his past, uncomfortable but for some reason obliged, or curious enough to attend that fateful invitation.The set up regarding Will's will power and practical empathy regarding injured coyote set up neatly his strength to act when necessary, and set some tone for his character.When we learn of his tragic past we feel empathy for him, yet it also makes us question his sanity and state of mind, is he paranoia or not and his suspicions justified?A clever use of a single location, and the cinematography and lighting works well in supporting the story which has us questioning for a good part of the journey, what is going on?A well executed film, a truly riveting experience and well worth watching!",The Invitation

278,adrijdin,Worth watching but a bit of a missed opportunity,7,1 October 2016,"This review not only contains spoilers it's essentially only for people who have already watched the film.I enjoy interesting philosophical themes in films. The questions of what happens after physical death, how to handle grief, how to be happy and whether there are any viable alternatives in terms of lifestyle to the status quo, were all explored to a degree here. The scenes at the party where the 4 ""outsiders"" opened up about the new way they've chosen to live and disturbing tidbits from their past and how the others reacted to that were highly intriguing. Some of the dialogue was quite realistic. the characters (the normal people as well as the woo woos) were relatable and I have come into contact with 'free-love' types on the fringes of society. Although I too am a seeker and I believe the possibility that there are different and/or better ways to experience life than that which is utterly normal, I recognized a way of being or an attitude (in the supposed ""cult members"") that I find fake and annoying, and that was illustrated very well. At the same time, all of us who do live normally and experience pain, suffering, and boredom, do wonder despite being annoyed by these types if they're onto something.So that was the good. This film, while watchable and enjoyable, In my opinion, left too many unanswered questions. There are scenes in this movie that left me scratching my head in terms of what was being shown and why. The gist of it all is that these 4 cult members are planning to die that night and would like to take the closest friends of one of the members along with them. It was never explained why. The only thing that I could come up with was that she wanted to be surrounded by the people she loved the most when she died (and felt ready to go there, to be with her son who had previously passed away) and figured the only way to do that was to kill them, too. The morals of the group were never delved into. For instance, we learn that they most certainly believe in survival of the personality after death, and that death is a journey to a wonderful mode of being, but how or why that translates into speeding up the passage there via suicide-murder is not remotely clear. Their opinion is basically that there is no need to grieve the loss of loved ones or fear death, because we are going to see them all again when we die, so lets just go ahead and die now! This (minus the very last part) is basically what many religions and spiritual teachings are all about, and probably what most non-spiritual people might think constitutes the whole of mystical thinking. But that is not so. It is an overly-simplistic, naive, way of viewing reality. Maybe that is what the film was trying to show. But for all I know, the makers of this film also do not realize that there could be any more to metaphysical interpretations of non-physical reality than that which is espoused by this cult. There is a scene in the movie where the main woman (the one who lost her son), called Eden, is explaining that she has found a way to be happy, that negative feelings and emotions are merely chemical reactions in the brain that can be avoided entirely. It's actually an exciting monologue, as many religions and mystical wise people have also spoken words to this effect, and I believe that to some degree this is true. However, immediately after, her action and tone reveal that she is hardly without pain and even rage. I don't know whether this was merely foreshadowing or a window into her psyche or it served to show that it is indeed impossible to dispel negative emotions. In fact, i almost feel that that was the entire message of the movie: that life is horrible and there is nothing we can do to get through it besides endure. But it doesn't seem to take into consideration that one can endure and get through it to the other side without either joining a cult or just being a depressed person with unhappy relationships for the rest of their life. I really don't think it has to be that way. Of course, it is a terrible thing to lose a child, and the grief that would follow that would be enormous in any normal person. The film shows the difference in the way that both parents of the little boy who died (now separated) are handling that grief, as though those are the only 2 options. As though the only alternative to endless suffering is complete delusion. I strongly disagree with this apparent conclusion, and if the movie had gone beyond that in terms of varying beliefs among the different characters, if there had been a ray of hope in all this, I think it could have been a much more sophisticated and memorable film.Nonetheless, I did enjoy watching it, and it got me thinking.",The Invitation

The premise was implausible. I wouldn't go to a dinner party hosted by my ""ex"" or the ""ex"" of my significant other. Let's throw in a dead child that the ""ex"" and I had and are still experiencing massive amounts of guilt and grieve over.
Then EVERYTHING GOES HORRIBLY WRONG.

Turns out the dinner party wasn't just a chance to reconnect with old friends. The ""ex"" and her new husband have just returned from a commune in Mexico and are on a recruiting drive.
(Raise your hand if you would leave this party before the appetizers were served.)
Then the hosting couple ( weird smiles on their faces ) play a video for the guests of a women dying amongst cult members. They play a weird party game which causes one guest to finally say she feels uncomfortable and she leaves ( or does she ).
The story goes on... the ending is good but the events that lead up to it just don't make sense or I'm just antisocial and don't go to enough dinner parties to understand what is and what is not acceptable behavior. Out of 4 skulls I give it a 1.5 Skull rating. The Mrs agrees.",The Invitation

And while I found the premise interesting, and the cult trick very intriguing, the chain of events weren't as exciting as I thought they would be. I have to admit it was the first time in a film that my ideas of how they story should unfold was way more intriguing than what it actually happened. Also, while it was filled with the right amount of darkness and acting was overall very good, i think there was a problem with actors' chemistry.

If they wanted to ""join"" their deceased loved ones, they could have done so without killing so many others. We also never find out what happened to the lady who left the house early on. Was she killed too? And why was no one besides the main character alarmed by the fact that the homeowners could lock people IN the house?

Altogether the pattern of Will's consistent No's throughout the movie is questionable. The Screenplay is questionable, it's flow is questionable. It's QUESTIONABLE. Will's persistent refusal to leave the party, provoke a kind of telenovela vibe, just to extend the a scene on to another, to its end. A forced, and pretentious slow build-up.",The Invitation

Much of the last act of the film is entirely predictable, and there is no doubt in my mind that the final twist will leave you disappointed.**Spoilers below**It is perfectly clear that this is going to be a 'suicide cult' in the end to anyone who is paying attention to the film. Having said that, I wouldn't blame you for not paying attention for the entire 100 minutes as the first hour does precious little to capture your attention. The last half an hour ramps up the pace with almost no warning, which is bizarre given how obvious the 'clues' are throughout the rest of the film. The twist in the final moments that this is happening in almost every house in the entire neighbourhood completely obliterates any suspension of disbelief.

The film needed a complete rewrite, and a couple of the roles should have been recast while one character should have been eliminated all together. The film was not believable in any sense; you felt the writer was going out of their way to be politically correct: an interracial couple, a gay couple, an Asian couple, and a few other people all come together to attend the dinner party from hell.

332,xeliasx,A Golden Opportunity Missed,6,1 May 2017,"The Invitation had one of the most tense build ups I have ever witnessed on screen. I actually was biting my nails in suspense, so sharp you could cut it with a knife. Unfortunately, it ended up being all foreplay and no climax as we waited nearly the entire film to end with no true emotional satisfaction or feeling of awe.The build up was golden, the low woodwind instruments gave you a pit in your throat knowing something was really wrong, and the dramatic irony almost of us knowing our protagonist is right but not knowing when it will be revealed was truly having me on the edge of my seat. However, when it actually came down to business, we didn't really get much of a pay off. Yes we find out it was supposed to be a ritual suicide but the story without emotional content made it almost hard to let go. I found myself begging for answers that we just didn't get, and not in a clever holding back way. For example, what the heck happened to Claire? We never even find out why she was doing this? Okay yes, take the pain away, but she literally says ""I almost let it kill me"" about the loss of her son, but now shes gonna kill herself? Something doesn't add up. And above all why the does he bring her out to the yard so she can die peacefully where she wants to? Hello, she just murdered most of your friend group and you don't even demand answers or feel a deep anger towards her? If anything I thought it would come back to the mercy killing with the fox, great set up and bad missed opportunity there.I gotta say I was laughing at the end with the black girl (they totally just threw in there not to have a whitewashed movie) just had to be thinking ""this is why i'm never going to a dinner party with crazy ass white people ever again"" Overall, I probably would recommend someone to watch it, with the disclaimer that they aren't going to leave with any satisfaction from it. It entertains, it tenses, but it does not deliver. Straight to DVD, without the score not even sure if that. I would say it could have done a lot of good with an extra half hour to balance out tension & action instead of a not boring, but slow, build up with a very fast climax.

This film is a decent watch if you're looking for a suspenseful slow-buildup thriller.
The pros in this film include the the eerie and tense atmosphere that is apparent from the start of the film, the use of silence and seemingly random strange encounters and conversations that built up the tension throughout the film which set the tone of the film in the right direction. I enjoyed the focus on people's faces and expressions to convey the mood of the room. There wasn't a moment that I didn't want to know what would happen next or that I was bored.On the downside, some of the dialog was a little cringy, but it was easy enough to look past that. I did guess how the film was going to end pretty early on in the film, although there was one twist to it. There was a kind of predictability with the clues that they presented to the audience, so I wasn't exactly mind-blown.Despite that, it was an enjoyable experience and more or less the kind of film I was expecting it to be.

I had no idea what this film was going to be about, I went in blind. I was on edge the entire time.Watching this movie alone at midnight was a mistake, something I would not recommend. I dread to think what my heart rate was at certain moments. There is a suspense there throughout the entire runtime and you know that something just isn't quite right.To me this is a horror movie. But a real horror movie. Not a jump scare filled, gore fest with killer clowns. But the type of horror movie that keeps you on edge the entire time, in a similar way to Get Out. You are disturbed by some of the characters because they are completely real people. This is something that you can genuinely imagine happening and for me that is why it is so terrifying.The music is played at the right moments and only makes those scenes even more tense, as does the silence is other scenes. Once I'd managed to under Tom Hardy, I thought that Logan Marshall-Green was brilliant. Other characters were pretty much generic movie characters bar a few.I think it's safe to say I was definitely shook up by this film, partly down to the fact I don't handle films with this level of tension too way but mostly due to how well the tension was done. And it didn't lose any of until the credits. For me the final shot is just horrifying.A very well done film, kept me firmly invested the whole time and left me rather disturbed afterwards.

I'm fine with slow burns, but even when the film climaxed, I didn't feel much of a burn. I think it's because none of the characters felt like real people, nor did any of the situations feel real. As far as the dialogue was concerned, plenty of the conversations felt clunky, and not just because someone was acting eerie. One thing that comes to mind is the leading character, Will, flip-flopping constantly about whether he wanted to stay or go. I could understand him being uncertain whether to trust his perceptions, but I never felt real depth or reasoning from him - it didn't feel like a dilemma so much as the script dictating, ""This is Will's decision for now until the next thing happens."" But I did give a few stars because I liked some themes (even if they was presented loosely), and I guess because it did keep me on until the end, because I wanted to try and understand the characters' bizarre motivations.

364,yellowflicker,Read this before you watch it,5,25 April 2020,"I normally don't write reviews on IMDB but this movie seriously gave me so much motivation to do that. And not in a good way.I've been a thriller/suspense/horror genre fan for years, I watched many movies from psychological thrillers to straight up gore movies to suspense and all that, so when I read this movie's description, I was like ""yeah, I gotta watch this definitely."" And oh boy I did.First of all I'd like to say that, the movie could have been at least 50 minutes shorter if you cut out the weirdly long pauses in conversations, in between stares and awkward silence when the main character Will walks around in the house without anyone noticing him leaving - at least 5 times by the way. It was a slow-burn I get that but there should be a limit to how much you can ""take slow"". If you erase everything I stated above, the movie would have been maybe an hour long and wouldn't bore you that much.When such a long long slow-burn happens, you anticipate a very good ending with a very good explanation behind it. Some parts you'll have to fill in for yourself of course as the audience. However, the problem here is, how stupid a group of people can be just because they're in a horror movie? There was only one who was clever enough to leave and we don't even know if she ever ""really"" made it out. I'm trying to spoiler free here but oh god how much I wanna say everything.The film was intended to give the audience some suspense and some feelings of paranoia, yet it only gave me a boring time. Why? Because, it is mostly from the point of Will-the main character so you only see his struggles, assume that he's probably gone insane but at the same time, all the hosts in the house act very weird (Eden and David). When in the first 10 mins of the movie two new characters came to the house, who weren't ""the group's"" friends at all, nobody even questioned who they were. The group was so welcoming to the two new strangers, coming to a party that was supposed to be reunion for a group of friends who hadn't seen each other in two years. Those two should've seen irrelevant and should've caused suspicion in the first place. But it didn't at all.Basically, that suspense didn't get resolved for 1 hour and 20 mins, then suddenly it all became clear at the end of the night. So if you just watched about the first 40 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the movie, you would understand it very good. But there are also too many plotholes, I'm not gonna say them here to be spoiler-free.If you choose to watch this because the cast is good or the poster looks fine (that's what I did) you have a big chance of being disappointed, at least I was.",The Invitation
365,bretthilberg,"So, so predictable",6,8 November 2018,"I thought that the two bits of foreshadowing in this film didn't so much hint at what was coming, but instead screamed it in your face. Reviews saying it was surprising or tense are way off. **SPOILERS**The opening scene was so blatant, and so different from the rest of the film, that by when the video from Mexico is shown, it becomes very clear how that the film will end with trauma survivors being ""put out of their misery"" just like the coyote. The rest is just waiting for it to get there.There was so little plot that the second major bit of foreshadowing (lighting the lamp) was an obvious tip off for the end.Acting wasn't bad, but the characters didn't feel relatable and instead of building tension, most of the film felt like filler before the big finale, which in all fairness, was startling in the way it began, although not surprising.Didn't hate it while watching it, but felt ripped off at the end.

Often happy to deviate from so called blockbusters I trawl the internet looking for recommendations. Sadly, for me, this was not a hidden gem.Kicking off the movie opens with a slightly disturbing scene..I wouldn't have minded if it later had some relevance of weight.....I didn't find it.I initially felt a light sense of intrigue BUT what ensued was a drawn out process...perhaps intended to build suspense or add depth to characters BUT I didn't feel the film did either.A drawn out painful excursion with me having little concern for the fate of those vulnerable to the sharp end.Sub plots lacked emotional depth or obvious relevance to the main plot.Final minute of film indicated the viewer should perhaps have been left even more intrigued. I was not that viewer !Some acceptable acting - Logan Marshall convinced me he felt (understandably) paranoid. No wonder he wanted to leave.I pressed the pause button several times to see whether it was worth viewing until the end.........I only do this with a minority of films.100 mins of my life that I would have rather watched trash TV .....( I don't like trash TV ! ) .Some who liked this ma have greater depth & understanding of films than me.....On this outing I am happy if some may regard me as an ignorant philistine.I seldom extend a hand gesticulation to a TV screen, however. the disappointed moron within me made me do so as end credits rolled.",The Invitation

While watching the movie I felt like everything was too predictable, I always knew something bad was going to happen and I knew that guy Pruitt had to do with it since he entered the house. Some of the characters's actions are questionable and a few moments are too forced, like Will's memories interfering with the reality.

This is only heightened as the movie progresses. The movie surely captivates you and makes you quite unsure of what to think. They lead you into believing something is about to happen but keep prolonging it. This undeniably helps with the suspense. The characters are very mysterious and spooky which is perfect for the tone of the movie. Especially the lead, he kills it. There is also an emotional aspect of the film that I feel they didn't use or portray in the best way. It tends to be overlooked and is completely run over by the suspense. As for the suspense itself, they build it very well right up to the end, but finish in a hurried manner (I was like is this all? )In the end it is undoubtedly an edge of the seat thriller, but when you think of it you feel like you've seen several movies which are similar.",The Invitation

I honestly was so surprised by this movie. I put it on expecting to be let down by so many other recent Hollywood horror films (eg. The Boy, The Witch) however it really did stick with me. I think apart of this is that its such a small film with a limited budget. It has fairly unknown actors but shines bright with its eerie atmosphere. Yes it is a slow burner and takes a while for you to care about the characters but the film has a way of making you feel seriously freaked out and then perfectly safe, just to creep the hell out of you again two minutes later.

374,laurahill-23172,Would recommend!,7,18 January 2017,"After looking for a horror to watch, I came across The Invitation. Firstly, it's not a horror but more of a mystery/thriller, so if you are looking for lots of jump scares and gore then don't watch this movie.I was hooked from the beginning and not just because of Tom Hardy doppelganger Logan Marshall-Green. A story about a reunion dinner party taking place between friends, with some iffy guests and odd party games, the question is.. Is Will paranoid? What are the motives of the hosts? While not much actually happens in the first 1 hour 15 mins, there is a sense foreboding maintained throughout, with the palpable tension of the lead character, eerie lighting, blurred camera effects and flashbacks. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat.As other reviews have said, some of the best moments were between the two lead males, LMG and Game of Thrones actor Michiel Huisman. It is almost as if they are fighting for the role of alpha-male. A side note to that - they are both gorgeous and while this is slightly irrelevant, it made the movie just that little bit more enjoyable. I gave it a slightly lower score because although it added to the effectiveness of the movie, the build up to the climax was a little bit too lengthy and the climax itself was mildly disappointing. Would recommend!",The Invitation
375,andreah-12955,none of these zombies have a clue.,8,28 May 2016,"On the surface level, a very good thriller. It had my heart racing and my palms sweating bullets to the end, and I really appreciated the completely unique approaches to situations we've seen in movies our whole lives. There are many layers to this film but I'll first address the surface. I see many reviews here saying the plot was predictable....... Please understand that knowing that these people were indoctrinated into a cult is necessary. The film didn't really rely on the fact that the bad guys were in a cult to scare the audience. The tension was built and mounted upon knowing this, and slowly seeing the dinner party (red wedding) go from catastrophe to catastrophe without there being a killing spree. You think the killing is going to be around this corner, or that one, but they keep the tension going. This was the scary element (or one of the more obvious ones.) So if you didn't like the movie because it was ""too easy to figure out they were in a cult"": Congratulations, you're retarded. I noticed a few details; for example, there was red in every scene. There were very delicately placed pillars in very importance scenes; it's funny how Hollywood will leave their clues while explaining very important concepts that are perhaps beyond the storyline of the film. There was a repetitive symbol, which appeared to be an x within a circle (Has many meanings) plastered all over all the windows and many pieces of furniture, while curiously placed on the red lantern (again, very interesting symbolism) hung up in the lawn. The lantern in and of itself is worth mentioning, I can't decide it if signified the blood sacrifice to the ox (x within the circle) or what, but it's significant can't be appreciated here regardless. This film definitely paid attention to details. One of the key details in indicating who made this film and what it is actually about was the six point star not so randomly stitched into the pillow on the couch, seen as soon as will arrived at the house. I liked the sun salutations at the beginning of the (oc)cult video on the laptop, followed by an image of the moon at the end, and I especially liked the aleister Crowley look alike who spoke of his wife, who reminded him of ""the morning"" and ""the light."" What interesting descriptors! And then one detail that really spoke to me: David (David was very interesting name choice for historical reasons, he was the father of Solomon) was a music producer. He seemed pretty manipulative to me; David was very manipulative over Eden (also interesting name, nice pure white dress) while the anorexic waif like insane character was obsessed with the aleister Crowley doppelgänger, he clearly had her (psychologically) unde his thumb. And she very clearly had been traumatized from past abuse. Interestingly enough, the movie mentioned ""redirecting trauma"".. Anyways, According to Eden and David, their program was practiced by thousands of people in la and New York. How interesting. How interesting, that he was a music producer, and the end reveals that he is one of many sacrificing innocents to the ox. A legion, almost! Well played Hollywood. The devil certainly is in the details. Trust me, no one has a clue what your movies are actually about. It's probably better that way. I for one certainly don't explain to people what these movies are truly about anymore, because they'll think I'm insane, maybe not so ironically- just like the main character of the film who could see through the friendly facade and everyone thought he was paranoid. Well played, Hollywood. But that all aside, great acting, great script, score, beautiful cinematography, and a great thriller. I highly recommend this fascinating film.",The Invitation
376,crazycokedupdream,A thriller for people who don't watch horror films,9,14 March 2017,"I'm not going to give a review of this film. I'll leave that to others who can argue whether it was worth watch or not. For me, I feel it was one of the best thrillers with a horror bent that I have seen in a long while. But here's the thing, I don't really like horror films, avoid them most of the time, unless I heard a good word of mouth from someone. That's how I found The Invitation.After reading the reviews here, I would say the criticism falls in to two opposing camps. Those that thought it was thrilling, terrifying and well done movie and those who thought it was a waste of their time, slow and they saw all the punches coming.I think the difference is this, the latter camp watches a lot of horror films, nothing surprises them, they are looking for all the little nuances of all the other horror movies they have watched and are comparing them to the film they are currently watching. They are two - three steps ahead of a conventional audience and thus, nothing surprises them. To these folks, I can understand why the film fell flat, it's clear if you put the movie under a microscope you can tell what's going to happen and naturally with the purposefully drawn out pace of this film, they get bored waiting for the payoff.I, as well as the people who I have give / shown this film to, fall in to the other camp. We rarely watch films like this and therefore are willing to let it all play out without trying the guess what's going to happen next. It's certainly a creepy film and while we might imagine where it's going, we are willing to suspend our expectations and go along for the ride.My advice, watch this if you enjoy the ride up on the climbing roller coaster without thinking about the plunge when you reach the top.",The Invitation

378,basementbanter,"If You Hear Cult, Run: The Invitation",8,11 May 2017,"At the suggestion of a friend, I checked this movie out a few days ago, and what a great suggestion it was. Holy sh*t. It was intense. I kid you not from the very first scene I was uncomfortable, nervous and sweating. Although that probably has more to do with my over-productive sweat gland. My own bodily functions aside, this movie is fantastic. The premise is simple enough. A group of old friends reunite after two years for a dinner party in the hills outside LA. These friends suffered a falling out after a tragedy befell two of them, a couple Will, played by a guy trying his best to look like Vigo Mortensen, and his ex-wife Eden, played by some creepy psycho lady. Returning to the place of the tragedy, his Eden's old house, Will brings a new girlfriend to the dinner party. The party consists of half a dozen or so couples. Eden is living in the old house and married a second husband, named David. He is played by the recast Dario Naharis, and sorry to Game of Thrones book hardos he still doesn't have a yellow mustache nor does he rock a blue beard.Two mysterious friends of David's join the old group of friends. Pruitt, played by that fat bald-middle aged actor your 100% going to recognize but won't be able to name, and Sadie, the very definition of don't stick your dick in crazy, even though she's gorgeous enough to make you think twice and decide its totally worth it how bad could it be, then you end up with a broken computer and frozen chicken all over the floor, true story. The group comes together for dinner and drinks with some laughs, mostly coming from a really funny fat guy (only naturally, we all have one of those), some tears, and a ton of tense, thrilling scenes.Eden and David recently returned from a long trip to Mexico where they joined a cult. Hoping to deal with their dark pasts and personal demons, they accepted 'the invitation'. Now if you aren't terrified of the word cult already, then you are probably in a cult. Because those things are f**king creepy as sh*t. I don't care what anyone says I'm not drinking your damn Kool-Aid®. My own personal fears of cults aside, this movie will have you holding your seat till your knuckles are whiter than that one time your dad tried to rap along to Kanye.What I love most about this movie however, is how it plays with conventions and tropes of horror movies. For those who watch a lot of horror movies, the conventions and tropes of horror are easy to see coming. This movie cleverly sets up all of the basic scares and 'twists' that I've come to expect. But it went in a completely different direction than I expected at every turn. It got to the point where I genuinely did not know what was going to happen next. I started doubting who was the protagonist, what was logical and what was happening. It was almost as if one character knew he was in a horror movie and kept looking for classical horror movie tropes, but the movie was doing its best convincing us it wasn't a horror movie, which weirdly made it even scarier.From the beginning to the very end, there were twists, scares, and more tension than my body knew how to process. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. And if you are someone who is sick of crappy horror movies and wants to see something original, clever, and different I cannot recommend this enough. It is on Netflix® right now so you have no excuse not to watch it tonight. Screw that exam that determines your whole future. And if you don't have Netflix® get your life together. Get it or ask someone who has it to borrow it. If you don't have friends I don't know man buy a cat or something.",The Invitation

The build-up was very slow, and very painstaking. There were moments throughout the movie that I found myself looking into the backdrop, desperately hoping for something to happen - nothing did. One can claim that there are 'little details' happening throughout the movies, but in all honesty, for me, these details were not all that satisfying, or mysterious. It wasn't until 76 minutes and 58 seconds into the movie that my craving for something of substance was satisfied. At the very least, if a movie does this and follows through with a solid, climactic ending, it still has potential for redemption - this movie did not. It has an anti-climactic last 5 minutes, with a semi-satisfying ending. Overall I was not thoroughly impressed by any aspect of this movie, I give it a 6 because I think it had potential, and there are brief, fleeting, moments of the movie that were enjoyable, but I can't score it higher due to it's lack of content or individuality.",The Invitation

386,zacharyklozik,Tension and Paranoia Done Right,7,24 February 2020,"The Invitation (2015) is a movie that brilliantly constructs a story that continually makes the viewer question, what is safe? Kusama crafts a movie that never lets the viewer know what to trust, as all of the characters on the screen have features that leave a muck taste in your mouth.Tension is established throughout the movie by shadowy lighting and healthy use of the close-up, which drags the viewer into uncomfortable situations over and over again.The Invitation is a mystery, but not one that unravels cleanly and neatly like opening a gift on a wedding anniversary. The mystery has a great sense of realness to it. It is wrought with paranoia and doubt which makes it an interesting enigma.Overall, The Invitation is a solid movie. It has an entertaining mystery which is heightened by sophisticated cinematography and an exceptional score. My biggest issue with the film is that it is somewhat lacking stand out quality when it comes to storytelling. The mystery, which feels real and is interesting, also feels somewhat predictable at times. I judge movies heavily on if I desire a re-watch after the first viewing, and I am not jumping out of my seat to watch it again.The Invitation is a movie that portrays the power of cinematography to play on emotions and it contains some beautiful editing and construction.

396,tinyrockergrrl,Beautiful & suspenseful thriller that keeps you guessing...,10,14 August 2016,"Karyn Kusama's ""The Invitation"", is one of the most suspenseful horror thriller's (may not be for the faint of heart) I've since 2008's ""The Strangers"". With suspense built in ways that will make you physically tense in anticipation while feeling impossibly nervous, this movie will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what the %#^& is going on?!Because trust me. You will think that. What the %#^& is going on?! But you will find yourself genuinely caring about what's actually going down and why.I don't want to tell too much about the plot of the movie. Its best to go into this one knowing its simply about a dinner party.That's it. That's all you need to know. At one point, my jaw muscles were so tense, I had to pause the movie and relax a bit. True story.The cinematography includes dark rich colors, shadows and lots of fun, ingenious camera tricks that makes for beautiful eye candy. My favorites being the slow camera zoom as a story is told by one of the characters in the house and a lovely face-to-face father/son shot. About half-way through the movie, there is a crazily stunning infinity mirror shot of the main character Will, that may actually reflect the way you're feeling at this part of the movie.And we must talk about the main character Will and how ridiculously good looking he is. For any woman (and man, for that matter) out there who is a fan of Tom Hardy, you are in for a pleasant surprise. This man looks like if all of the times Tom Hardy has EVER been hot met the super scruffy, dirty, man hulk, hairy Tom Hardy and they had a lovechild, Logan Marshall-Green would be their spawn. This man is the epitome of the perfect Tom Hardy, if there was such a thing because let's face it, Tom Hardy himself is ridiculously HOT.But that's beside the point. Tom Hardy is NOT in ""The Invitation"" but a lovechild spawn of him is.There are times in this movie when homeboy Will (or Hottie Hardy) should have left after things were said. I found myself audibly telling him so by yelling at my TV screen. But I reckon if he left, this movie would not exist so therefore he stayed, which made for a most excellent movie. I truly believed everything about everyone but also that nothing was it seemed. The character chemistry was fantastic from Will's suspicion to Eden's sadness to Kira's defeat, with scenes where the tension was so thick that I found myself forgetting to breathe.Theodore Shapiro's music throughout is intensely alluring, gracefully building the suspense and heightening the overall mood to allow the audience to truly get caught up in what the %#^& is going on?!Several scenes were so powerfully sad that they almost made me forget that this was a horror thriller but then something would quickly remind me of just that and I would become nervous all over again. The acting was SO well done and the backstory was told beautifully between flashbacks that easily intensified the entire theme of the movie: grief and how people deal with it.""I've been waiting to die ever since the moment it happened"". Bravo for this line and the delivery of it.Grief is an overwhelming feeling that everyone deals with differently. Some days are easy to get through and other days are full of the most exhausting anguish there is. But knowing that we all go through our own share of heartache and sadness helps to make it a little easier to realize we're not going through it alone. Small, teeny tiny underlying message of the movie but absolutely not the main focus.What I'm trying to say is ""The Invitation"" is SUCH an amazing emotional roller-coaster that will keep you guessing until the very end.

First thing what hit me was tragically bad play of the actors and dramatically soulless and stupid dialogues. My first association was immediately ""The room"". But let's face it- the room was at least funny.
However, at this stage I was hoping that at least plot will safe everything. We all know movies with quite poor budget and even bad technical side which turned out to be interesting. But no, it is not one of these movies. During 90% of The Invitation nothing practically happens. Atmosphere is just weird due to bad play and stiff retarded dialogues but weird not in the interesting or attractive way. On the end happens exactly this what most of the people probably expect from start at some degree.
The only positive side of this movie is that the end could be a good introduction for some slasher.Not worth anyone's time and don't trust the positive opinions as I did. I think it must be some trolls who write them.",The Invitation

400,thecaddgod,I'd rather be left uninvited...,1,29 April 2016,"What can I say, but next time leave me off the guest list. Basically this was 99 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. Everything about this movie was sub-par. The writing, directing, editing and the acting were mediocre at best. The premise of the movie is great, but the execution is miserable. Nothing, save for the last 15 minutes, had me captivated or even compelled to keep watching, and I would have stopped, but for some reason I kept expecting it to get better. I kept holding out hope that the last __(insert number of minutes here) minutes of trite drivel are finally justified, but that never truly happened. It was like the world's most boring, slow motion train wreck. Mind you, it isn't the worst film I've seen, but it certainly ranks pretty low on the list. Everything about the plot and supposed twists were pretty evident and foreshadowed obviously. Guy talks about a cult, guess what happens. Guy talks about killing his wife, guess what happens. Guy freaks out over someone missing from the party, guess what happens. And yeah, I had a pretty strong idea of what was going to happen when guy lit the red lamp. In essence, virtually every event in the beginning of the movie may as well have been a neon sign saying ""Guess what happens next!"".Now, with films like this I never know who to blame, the writer or the editor. But someone needs to choose a different career path, because one of those two elements (or perhaps both) failed spectacularly. There was no actual character development. Nothing to genuinely explain why the main characters behaved the way they did. Oh sure, there was an attempt to do so, but that attempt was shallow and all but worthless. I get that the guy is mourning the loss of his son, that was explained pretty early on, but what's the reason for his bizarre and erratic behavior? Has he always acted that way, or is he still that deeply traumatized by his son's death 2 years earlier? Does he always snoop around people's houses? And why don't we ever see what actually happened to his son? The event itself seems to play pretty heavily to explain his mind set, but it's never fully revealed. Maybe if we knew what happened to his son it would help us relate to this character, but no, we're robbed of that opportunity and he becomes another dull, lifeless character in a dull, lifeless film.Insofar as the directing is concerned, meh, I've seen vastly better. I think, overall, the direction was handled thusly...Director to Actor: ""You act crazy and unhinged because this dinner party has reignited your unresolved grief over the loss of your son""Director to other Actors: ""You all act like you don't know what his problem is because it wasn't your kid that died in some mysterious fashion""Director to all Actors: ""And remember, getting an invitation out of the blue to see a group of people you haven't seen for years after their one of their kids died and was buried isn't slightly odd at all, so act like everything is normal...except for Mr. Unhinged.""Since all of the characters have the depth of a puddle, directing this movie doesn't seem like it was much of a challenge, and presumably didn't take any more effort than the writing or editing.Overall, the film has all of the look and feel of either a film school drop-out's mediocre attempt at mediocrity, or a first-year film school student's first project. Either way, not the stuff of legend, and certainly not worth the hype.If your goal is to see an incredibly well thought out and put together film, pick another. If you're really into seeing good concepts ruined tragically, then this is the movie for you!",The Invitation

There is no real explanation of why the main character would go to a party thrown by his ex wife and her new husband. His girlfriend is one of these characters that just walks and talks but doesn't seem to add anything to the story other than to add a possible body for the slaughter.

Halfway through, you would feel first half is boring and later is very much predictable but in 2nd half your would feel first half was much much better than the later.Seems like writers spent most of the time in writing first half and kept gruesome things fixed for later.Movie could have been better if twisted with Will imagining all the things, getting suspicious, afraid and shocked so much by the death of his child that he lost his mind.

Too many flashbacks that made us try to feel the pain of losing someone but it didn't work after the 5th or so.The character interactions to me, were very unrealistic. Your friends, even after not seeing them for a long time would never force you to stay or KEEP you in an uncomfortable situation. Also, real friends would not shush you when you speak out against a CLEAR and present danger. After the uncomfortable video and the confession of murder by John Carroll Lynch's character, everyone should have peaced out. Maybe it is somewhat realistic of people's politness and fakeness in S California. Either way, one person actually left. It was unnverving to me if she ACTUALLY got away so kudos ot the movie for that feeling.The big scene was pretty good but I wished Will would have not acted all surpised and stunned after he confirmed what he had been feeling all along about the hosts' intentions. I think some of the kills and actions were done for dramatic purposes and to have a dialogue but again, we don't really care about him and his ex-wife really. She is clearly psycho so her dying dramatically was kind of wasteful.Otherwise typical setup-dumb people die and a few smart ones actually fight back and win and get away.

417,teff_torbeich,A kinda psychological thriller,6,27 May 2016,"""The Invitation"" starts off with a bit of violence with the killing of a coyote after Will accidentally runs over it with the car. That cold blood act of killing an animal with bare hands gives us a glimpse of what the character is capable of and he does it without hesitating. After these first 5 minutes I expected the film to build its tension and hoped to be in the edge of my seat halfway through it. However, even though the suspense gets quite intense, the film turns out to have a really slow pace. The showing of the institutional video of the sect Eden and her boyfriend now below to is extremely long and gets boring. The arrival of the character ""Pruitt"" and the behavior of Sadie makes the viewer as uncomfortable as it makes Will. One good thing this film has is that you build your suspicions hand in hand with the main character and, like that, you start to question everything like he does. We reach the climax at the dinner after having small flashbacks to Eden and Will's life and loss that, in my opinion, should have been a bit more long and revealing. We hear the first gunshot and see two characters die after the toast and then we receive a big dose of tension and fear and shock. But the resolution takes only about 10 minutes and the film ends abruptly leaving you, still in shock, saying ""thats it?"" To me, the film lacked a lot in the ending and had too much in the beginning. I give it a 6 for the tension and the plot.",The Invitation

Perhaps expecting to see a horror, as it's categorized, was the biggest let down. This reminds me of The Big Chill, but with unknowns and less interesting characters. Nothing happens on top of nothing. What I would like to warn people about is this is not a horror nor a thriller by any stretch of your imagination. This is a mundanely slow developing drama.

422,ofeksharon1996,"A Unique, Slow Paced, Captivating, Well Executed(no pun intended) Piece!",8,2 July 2020,"OK.
I was not expecting my first review to be written on such an apparently unfamiliar, quite underrated(so to speak) movie.And yet, here I am.I've heard about The Invitation from Chris Stuckman who's movie reviews I appreciate and even though his mention of this film was only brief and as an example of Logan Marshall-Green's features in his review of Logan's also wonderful acting role in the sci-fi action-thriller movie Upgrade(2018), the few words he had to say about it got me quite intrigued and so I went and added it to my watchlist.This one got me invested right from the opening scene, thanks to the great directing of Karyn Musama.We meet our lead Will(played by Logan) and his partner Kira(played by Emayatzy Corinealdi) already on their way to a get-together, essentially jumping(or should I say driving) right to it.
On their way something seemingly meaningless happens but it feels to me like it's not even though I couldn't quite put my finger on its connection to the rest of the movie.
Then we meet Will's old friends followed by his ex-wife Eden - who he separated from after losing their only son a few years back - and her present partner David - with which his ex-wife disappeared for the last two years.
From the moment we meet these two, and as the movie moves along, there's an off-putting sensation radiating from them, approved to the audience by Will's reactions as well as his partner Kira and his friends.
This delicate interaction was, for me, the visual soundtrack to this movie.
It seems Eden has somehow managed to put her loss and pain in the past, while we get more and more signs from Will - many of which are elegantly presented to us in Will's scattered moments of roaming their old house(yeah, his ex-wife stayed in the house where they lived with their son) - that he's not in the same place.
This contrast between Will's and Eden's state of mind and their individual ways of coping with their shared painful past was played in such a subtle yet strong way and I found it very well intertwined in the chain of events.
The tension, which is built from the start almost without our awareness, gradually intensifying as Will becomes more and more alienated(gently put) to Eden's and David's ""hospitality"".
This only grows with the joining of Eden's and David's two mysterious friends Sadie and Pruitt, both unknown to all other guests present.Logan Marshall-Green's performance is really good and it does the most in feeding the contrast between him and Eden as previously mentioned, and in walking the viewers through the mystery slowly unfolding before us.
The rest of the cast is also worth mentioning for their performance as they all give us different parts to support this mysterious and in many ways fragile structure of events.The soundtrack does a lot to hold the plot in a very tense, almost sealed(pun intended) mood, even though it's more of a really low undertone for the most part.With many small breadcrumbs spread throughout the movie, we arrive at the nerve-wracking climax which is topped off with ending scene, sending us away with an unhinged jaw. One thing that bothers me about the ending is WHY, but I think that's something I'll be able to answer on a second viewing.All in all, a must-watch in my opinion, especially if you can appreciate slow-paced thrillers(reminding me of gems like 'Blade Runner 2049', 'Get Out', 'Joker', 'Parasite').",The Invitation

If you want to watch a film about an awkward dinner party that turns out to be the hosts trying to kill the guests because of a cult then by all means watch it. But be disappointed. From start to finish it was dull. The group of friends were made to watch a cult video of someone dying.. only one friend felt uncomfortable and left... no idea what happened to her but she was probably killed by one of the other guests who was part of the cult. Because the poisoning didn't go to plan it turned it to a slasher movie.. not a good slasher movie either. Apparently joining the cult helped the ex-wife come to terms with the death of her son.. but why does she need to take her friends with her to be with him too? Doesn't make sense really..

433,vixenofvines,The director Karyn Kusama turns this into a D movie. Don't waste your time and money!,1,8 April 2016,"An undergrad student director could have done a better job with the material. Karyn Kusama understands neither the genre nor how to direct actors according to the standards of even a B movie. As I said in my review title, this ended up being a D movie, where the audience at the Arclight Hollywood Cinema (which draws some discerning viewers that are not of the popcorn variety) ended up laughing at climactic moments that should have induced silent shudders. I was really looking forward to seeing a female director do something very special with the genre, but this woman seemed determined to prove to herself that she could be even more ""raw"" than a male director, and ended up generating utterly CHEAP, ludicrous and risibly melodramatic scenes (particularly during the ""grand"" finale). I feel sorry for lead actress Tammy Blanchard, whom I've seen live on Broadway, to have found herself in the hands of a director who reduced what should have been her most touching monologue to the stuff that Lifetime movie villainesses are made of. You are actually better off watching a Lifetime 'thriller' than wasting 100 minutes on this drivel. The movie could have easily been cut down by a solid 10-15 minutes if the director didn't spend as much time as she did on pointless close-ups and ridiculously repetitive shots. She keeps hitting the audience on the head with the fact that the main character, Will, is uncomfortable and haunted - to the point where you just end up feeling alienated from him altogether, half way into the movie, which is the opposite effect one would want to achieve when it comes to the protagonist.

I do give credit when it's deserved and say that the acting in the movie was well played by all but unfortunately the script and direction of it failed the movie.It did do well in creating an awkward dinner party in what was wanted by the director and I personally enjoyed the notation of the game 'I want' but that's where the likes stopped.An hour and forty minutes of what is said to be a thriller, drama and mystery where I perceived the movie to be a suspenseful drama that wasted my time and the only mystery was how this movie scored a 6.7. The movie is set in a house where friends reunite after not seeing each other for two years. There's no depth in it's story line nor does it deliver something we haven't seen in other colt related movies. When it does come to a climax it lets its audience down by not delivering When finally everything is unraveled its not awe you're in but rather 'that's it'? After watching this movie I instantly thought of the 1995 movie 'The last Supper', which it slightly imitated. This movie had potential but simply did not deliver. If it was planning to be a thriller, drama or mystery, simply chose one and do it well.",The Invitation

The tonality of the movie is like playing a piano and pressing all of the notes with your face, basically banging your head upon the keys in an attempt to make beautiful music, but as expected, all you get is noise and a headache.

It's very difficult to find horror/thriller movies that have a good plot, story line, characters and acting and this one is no exception.
Logan marshal Green (American Tom hardy) gives a phenomenal performance as the broken ex husband, and that doesn't mean to say he's the only one in this movie that gets a gold star, the rest of the cast give incredibly convincing performances.The character development is subtle yet fluid, the plot is innovative and sinister, the music is graceful yet dark, and the progression from comfort to sheer unsettling terror is perfection.You go through the first 3 segments of the film knowing something is wrong with increasing tenacity yet you have no clue as to what is going to happen, which then crescendos into an extremely satisfying ending.If you enjoy edge of your seat tension and suspense, beautiful cinematography and expert editing, incredible acting then this is the horror/thriller for you.",The Invitation

457,ghoulsheartcoffee,I don't understand the hype. It's terrible.,2,30 March 2019,"I adore horror movies, even psychological, mystery-filled thrillers, so I assumed this would be one of those. I saw the great reviews, and thought, ""Sounds awesome!""
No. Just no.
Literally watched the entire first hour of the film with a creeped-out, yet frustrated look. Most of the characters are intriguing and realistic, sure, but the couple who threw the party was absolutely creepy. I legitimately felt uncomfortable every time I saw them. Their acting-flawless. They played the part well.
But, I sat down to watch a thriller. A mystery. A horror. Anything exciting. Is that what I got? Absolutely not. I asked myself several times why I was still watching this boring, awkward reunion, cult creepfest, and I just kept thinking, ""Give it a chance. It has great reviews-It'll get better.""
Finally, an hour in exactly, the main character gets the phone call about Choi being already at the house. Finally, some excitement!
But no. Choi shows up, and the others wave off any suspicions. At this point, I start to assume the main character, Will, might just be crazy. Was this all in his head?
Then, after the big reveal about his dead son, he goes and watches the video on the laptop from the cult leader.
This was the point I thought, ""There's less than half an hour left-Is this really how it's going to end? He's going to accept their happy-go-lucky life??""
But the zing moment of climax, where he suddenly freaks out about the toast, is when it goes haywire. Everyone starts dying, and I'm thinking, ""I waited all this time...for this?"" A predictable ending of the main couple being the only survivors-aside from one friend, who surprisingly lived-and then they do the BIG, big reveal, that it was a mass, suicide/homicide freak-show extravaganza with the red lights somehow being their communication. And that was it.
Now, listen. I understand the drama-filled, tension-building, edge-of-your-seat story the writers were going for, but they fell short. It was boring, creepy, unlikable, and I had no desire to continue even a third of the way through except for the small hope that it would get better eventually.
And it did... Sort of. But all it left me with was frustration and a feeling of wasting an hour and a half of my time. Which it did.

The more the movie goes on it transitions more and more into a horror movie but unfortunately. The build up isn't bad but sadly the pay off isn't really worth it. The movie would have been better if it had focused on the main the characters grief for his son. This is the part of the movie that works quite well and the opening scene is simple but well done and does a good job at establishing the tone for the rest of the movie.
The grief for the main characters son as already said is done well and interesting to watch but gets pushed aside unfortunately in favor of being a mediocre horror movie.In conclusion: A potentially good movie with an interesting concept that unfortunately gets pushed aside as the movie on in favor of being a sloppy horror movie.",The Invitation

It doesn't pay off in the end because the conclusion happens in the last 15min of the movie and it is brief, everything escalates and finishes very quickly.

473,janetmarvanites,Suspenseful and Startling...A MUST SEE!!!!!,10,20 February 2020,"This film is suspenseful and dark. It's filled with tragedy, old friendships, and new mysterious friendships. The Invitation keeps you guessing the reasons for the gathering every step of the way. Karyn Kusana's direction of this cast was spot on in my opinion. The actor's portrayals of friends and mysterious guest were believable. Logan Marshall-Green's performance stands out. He is convincing in his role as Will the tortured father and ex-husband, who comes back to his former home after receiving an invitation from his ex-wife Eden. Will's skeptic observations and emotional roller coaster ride throughout the movie has you on the edge of your seat. The movie starts out slow but gradually builds up momentum to an explosive ending and a startling revelation. The low-key lighting mixed with the uncomfortable calm is eerie and adds to the tension and suspense surrounding these individuals. The Camera's close-up shots when Will has his memory flashbacks adds to his silent, but angry demeanor which draws the viewer in. John Carroll Lynch's character Pruitt is calm and disturbing from the time he appears in the film. The Invitation at times plays on your psyche and makes you question certain situations two or three times in the film. I truly enjoyed watching this entire movie. I connected with the character's and I was drawn into the story line. The ending of the film was surprisingly unexpected and a perfect ending in my opinion. The Invitation has all the main characteristics of a modern horror film and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a mix of mystery and horror.",The Invitation
474,samanthachoffman,Horror Film Class Review,4,20 February 2020,"In the movie The Invitation, tension builds through the use of Will and Eden's varied responses to their son's death. While Will takes the route that most people would take in letting the various stages of grief play out, Eden goes to Mexico to join a group that will allow her to be released from pain. The lighting helps create this tension because the lighting is often low key lighting given off by candles or lamps throughout the rooms. As the tension grows between Will, Eden and Eden's new husband David, the other guests are drawn into it. As the tension grows, the lighting seems to get darker. When the tension finally breaks during the final scenes, the lighting seems to shut off. It is during these final scenes, that it brought up thoughts of intertextuality with the Jamestown massacre and Heaven's Gate. The color red used in the lantern that David lights and the red of the wine that the victims are given foreshadows the death and destruction that is about to happen. The lack of lighting and the reminder that all the doors in the house are locked creates a feeling in the audience that they are just as trapped as those actually trapped in the house. Not only did the poisioned wine drinking remind me of actual historical events, the scenes that followed reminded me of the typical end scene of a horror movie, especially in movies like Halloween, Alien, and Nightmare on Elm Street. The rising tension leading up to the final scenes added to the suspense of the movie but seemed to make the movie longer than what it was. Until the final scenes, it was unclear what was actually going to happen to the victims, even if you knew the history of events like the Jamestown Massacre and Heaven's Gate.",The Invitation
475,jcpatino-66607,Worst. Dinner party. Ever.,10,23 February 2020,"I'm never going to a dinner party in the Hollywood Hills, no matter how good looking the people are.Subdued, meticulous and distinctive in tone, The Invitation is a film whose horrors lie in human behavior rather than supernatural forces. Director Karyn Kusama taps into the primal nature of paranoia and suspicion to craft an engrossing psychological thriller that will do everything it can to spike your anxiety up into the stratosphere. The film also serves as a poignant study of loss and the lengths to which a person will go to free themselves of its pain.This film is a series of tensions and diffusions. The strength of The Invitation comes from its unpredictability. It keeps the audience second-guessing every visual cue and character action. The sense of unease stems from dissonance among the characters. The situation they're in gets weirder and weirder, but the nature of social etiquette keeps the characters quiet. The filmmakers keenly exploit people's innate impulse for side-stepping public displays of strangeness to conjure up an excellent sense of sustained tension. Carefully placed diversions keep us and protagonist Will (Logan Marshall-Green in a tour-de-force performance) on edge, constantly rethinking and reanalyzing the situation.Kusama is in no rush to tell her story. The film's pacing is what I term an onion. The layers peel back steadily, giving us only as much information as necessary. The brilliance of the editing lies in the film's alignment with Will. We never know more than him, and his perspective is the movie. Keeping us in step with Will's line of sight maintains the apprehension, feeding our uncertainty and doubt.However, the film's real power lies in its allegories. The shock and awe of its scares and surprises are all the more potent because of the emotional richness drawn from the themes and characters. There's a conflict embedded in the film, a questioning posited. When is self-forgiveness a mask for denial? Is one's awareness of death an honorable honesty or charlatan's façade? These internal battles play out in cataclysmic fashion, harrowing the characters and viewers alike to the bitter end.",The Invitation
476,kylemolson,Good Story but not built well,5,21 February 2020,"Karyn Kusama's 2015 film, The Invitation, was overall a below-average movie, in my opinion. I believe the concept of this movie was well drawn out, however, the execution of the film was lengthy, not entertaining, and quite frankly, annoying. The Invitation is like a kid's roller coaster, having the few little bumps, but at an extremely slow speed and just keeps going around in a circle. To start, the awkwardness of the film and characters do play into the curiosity and desire to understand as an audience what exactly is happening. The movie starts with absolutely no background other than the beginning scene, alluding to future struggles the group of friends ultimately face. This leaves the audience to have to pick up subtle hints throughout the movie, and not even understanding the problem until it's almost over, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The Invitation is marketed as a horror movie, and even has the low-key lighting that a typical horror film may have, but I would certainly not classify this film as a horror. The Invitation is a suspenseful mystery, with no real feeling of fear or horrific events that a normal horror movie would include. Moreover, the film was annoying because of its certainty that everyone knew what was coming, but it continued to drag on by introducing new information that ultimately led to the same result, only taking a longer time to figure out. The best part of this movie was obviously the end. The end was finally the thrill of the movie that makes you feel apart of the suspense that was unfolding throughout the entirety of the movie. In my opinion, this movie could be made better by getting rid of much of the boring beginning and start the exciting ending much sooner and drag that part out, leaving the audience to be strapped in, needing to figure out the clues and reasons behind the madness all while being trapped in the thrilling and unexpected part of the storyline. I do believe that the idea of The Invitation was a smart idea, with great clues, a good storyline, and twists, but it was given in a way that dragged on too long, only to be struck with the final bombshell in the last 20 minutes. I would not say this is a bad film, I just believe there was a better way to stagger the plot into a more thrilling story without an extended beginning.",The Invitation
477,lightscamerakate,An invitation to remember...,6,23 February 2020,"This film is worth watching, but not for the reasons you might think. It is best to approach the film without grand expectations and with the realization that it is not your typical horror movie. It is best described as a psychological mystery/drama.
The general narrative structure is mediocre at best and highly predictable. The mystery of the invitation is revealed early on despite the attempt of hiding it with the uncomfortable atmosphere of the dinner party. Still, there are some redeeming qualities that make it worth watching at least once.
The spiritual message and social commentary weaved throughout the film are intriguing, particularly how it is portrayed through Will's ex-wife. When she is first introduced, Eden enters the room as a vision of purity in her white, flowy attire-a direct nod to The Garden of Eden. Visually, she represents perfection, much like the paradise environment that is associated with the biblical garden. Yet, if you recall the story, Eden is not perfection, but potential. Internally, she is susceptible to the ways of evil, most notably death and deception as seen in the film, and the serpent in the Bible. For Eden, and the other followers, this potential manifests itself in an idea that pain is optional and its removal can be achieved through transcendence.
The ""cult"" that has invaded several homes in the surrounding neighborhood, as demonstrated by the lantern lighting, seems like a comment on mental health. The people of the cult have been brought together by their experiences with trauma and inability to cope with it. The flashbacks that Will has provide a glimpse into Eden's mental instability over the loss of their son. While this specific traumatic incident is not experienced by everyone, the emotions that follow are a commonality throughout society. Unfortunately for Eden, and so many others, transcendence (suicide) is a way to remove the pain of severe depression.
Despite the slow moving and predictable nature of the film, the underlying message does make it worth watching. Again, don't go into it with high expectations, but watch it for the social commentary.",The Invitation
478,megankobrien,Yet Another Dinner Party from Hell...,8,23 February 2020,"WARNING: SPOILERS
Welcome to yet another dinner party from hell, which could very well be the tagline for Karyn Kusama's 2015 film The Invitation. This film is the definition of a slow burn because whenever you think something violent is about to happen it pivots in a new direction. However, this doesn't mean it's void of tension as it's always there simmering beneath the surface. Every sound from the clattering of wine glasses to the constant beeping of a car engine is articulated to the point where audiences are left waiting for a release that will never come (until the last 30 minutes of the film that is).Kusama along with cinematographer Bobby Shore did a wonderful job creating an aesthetically pleasing film where meaning is infused into every image. The film predominantly takes place during present day, but it does feature systematically placed flashbacks to flesh out character backstory. The cooler tones used in flashbacks give off a nurturing and calming effect that comes with domestic bliss while the transition to warmer tones represent the underlying anger of the present that will inevitably boil to the surface. The addition of a low-key lighting scheme, which is a staple in the horror and thriller genres, bathes the whole interior in shadows to further emphasize the mysterious nature of the evening.Throughout The Invitation, there is a theme of death and how individuals deal with grief. When we are at our must vulnerable is often when vultures strike because we are more susceptible to their influence. No matter how twisted their ideology may be the ""monsters"" are victims themselves who are only doing what they've been told will free them from their pain, which in the end is a very human emotion. This is adeptly depicted by all the actors involved, but particularly by Tammy Blanchard's portrayal of Eden, a woman who is desperately trying to escape an all-consuming grief. I recommend going in knowing nothing about The Invitation in order to get the maximum effect, which is surprising coming from someone who reads film synopses because she hates surprises.",The Invitation
479,heidyrodriguez-86274,Reunion Dinner Oddities,6,24 February 2020,"A SPOILER ALERT""Horror films don't have to have someone die within the first hour of the film to be considered a horror film"" is what I told myself as I was patiently waiting for a climactic scene to peek its way onto the screen. They actually don't have to have a death at all since one of the most renown horror films of all time, Poltergeist, has no deaths. Try to argue that it's not horror and you will be met with waves of fury from the horror film community.With The Invitation, the basic plotline of friends coming together in reunion or celebration is nothing new. Look at The Cabin in the Woods, college students get together for a cabin vacation and end up being slaughtered one by one. The other common theme is that they both have groups of people that believe the deaths of others will be serving a greater purpose than if they were to stay alive. ""Brainwashing"" could be a term used to describe the reasonings behind David, Eden, Sadie, and Pruitt's downfalls. The trust that those four had in the teachings of Dr. Joseph was something that they were willing to die for. When a person is willing to die for their beliefs, then there is nothing but death that can stop them.Notably as well, is the domino effect that springs up in the last minute of the film. Domino effects are usually used in a negative connotation rather than a positive one. You hear it being used as a warning most of the time to watch what you say or do. No real surprise to see the concept used in a horror film since it gives the feeling of intimacy to the viewer that the virus is spreading like wildfire and it's only a matter of time until they're next in line.",The Invitation
480,marithzajimenez,"The Invitation, a slow burner.",3,24 February 2020,"Karyn Kasuma's 2015 film, The Invitation, is a slow burner to get to the all too predictable ending. I would not recommend this film if you are more of a fast and furious kind of person. I would not consider this film to be horror nor a thriller either. I'm not much of a horror or thriller person but in this film there is nothing that is quite horrific or thrilling about it.The dull characters and bad acting leads to an all but less than mediocre ending. The interactions between supposed friends does not seem realistic.The constant wait for something to happen creates boredom. As the storyline continues it becomes more and more predictable to know what will happen next.The locking of the front door in the beginning to the idea of a cult and the drinking of wine immediately gave away the ending for me. Don't get me wrong there is a constant build up with the silent suspense and the suspenseful soundtrack that attempts to create a re-engagement in the film. Leading the audience to hope for something to happen, except we get nothing. Other than for the first and last fifteen minutes that contains most of the story line and drama, the film has a great amount of flashbacks that could have been done better to fit the plot of the film. The few jump scare attempts are not as effective or memorable either as the plot of the film slows down and stays that way until the end. Overall, the film did not stand up to par to its category of being a horror and drama film. It relies too much on the tension build up to keep the audience engaged, but in reality it does not. There is drama between the characters, but not enough to create horror. The Invitation, is only sub par to what it was expected to be.",The Invitation
481,angelargagliano,A Dinner Party from Hell,5,24 February 2020,"(Spoilers)The Invitation (2015) directed by Karyn Kusama is all centered around a dinner party that is anything but traditional. This psychological thriller starts off with a slow pace that never really picks up. If you know anything about history, cults or perhaps even conspiracy theories then you'll most likely figure the ending to this film out. Kusama just missed the mark on this thriller. The film spends a substancial amount of time focusing on little hints that those who are throwing the dinner party are not well in the head. I found myself wanting to be scared, becuase Kusama does do a good job of building up tension. Yet, too many times in this film the movie just flops. The film focuses strongly on the paranoia of the characters without putting a paranoid or thrilling feeling into the audience. The film moves at such a slow pace that it kills any tension or anxiety that was built up. The characters have very dull and yet very different personalities. These personalities seems like they are almost too different for the characters to even have a relationship with each other. Creating no real connection between the viewer and the characters. This film mainly takes place in the same house, which is not necessarily bad, if anything this should help Kusama with making her audience feel trapped. Still, I feel the mark was missed due to the ""homey"" feel and the lighting. Overall the film seemed too predictable. The slow pace killed tension while the characters made this film feel tedious to watch. This film seemed like it was meant to be a psychological thriller more then a horror film. Still, I'd argue the film is also barely a psychological thriller because of how easy it is to know who the antagonist(s) are. This dinner party from Hell was as scary as expecting a good meal and getting McDonalds instead. Could have been a great concept but was executed cheaply and very dull.",The Invitation
482,veseliniivanov,The Invitation VS Horror,8,24 February 2020,"Spoiler Alert BelowThe Invitation is a type of movie that no one would expect to be in the Horror genre, but there is a reason why it is considered a Horror film. This movie is not about the jump scares and the creepy monsters out of our imaginations. The Invitation really uses a slow build up to have such an impact at the late scenes of the movie. It is real to the point that it is possible in real life. We hear about murders and brainwashing but we never realize it is happening right outside of our doorsteps. The way The Invitation is set up brings a feeling of suspense and caution by incorporating a sad backstory to the main character and a drifting between two souls who went trough a trauma and dealt with it in different ways. The deep connection we encounter with the main character gives us a sense of what he went through with the loss of his son. The movie incorporates a lowkey lighting to contribute of the feeling that something is off and something horrifying is going to occur while we are presented with a perfectly normal setting. From the beginning we notice Will have this uneasy feeling and being all skeptical while everyone else is relaxed and enjoying the night. We start questioning what is going on because it throws you off. This movie strays from the four main components of modern horror. It does this by straying from the questioning of rationality, there is no inhuman aspect of any part of the film. There are not supernatural or unkillable monster. This breaks the 3rd main component of the modern horror. We do not get any violation of boundaries and if we do, they are bare minimum which is another aspect that this film is missing from the four main components of modern horror. Overall this movie is a different type of horror and it gives the feeling we all search for when we watch horror in a different unique way.",The Invitation
483,austinkeate,Meh,4,24 February 2020,"The invitation by Karyn Kusama felt like a very long and drawn out movie. She used a very diverse group of actors. If you take out the loud, over the top sounds and music in the first 80 minutes of the movie then it is just a group of friends hanging out with four obvious cult members. As paranoid as Will was, I am surprised he did not insist on leaving. It also makes it very obvious to the audience, considering its a horror film that something is going to happen. This is the first movie I have ever watched that builds up too much suspense with the clues left behind, music, setting, and behavior of the characters. Everyone and their dog knew that when Will pointed out the bars on the window and locked door that something was going to happen. Even though it is a horror movie and people are supposed to be oblivious to general things, this seemed like there were too many big red flags that they just brushed off, like the video of the woman dying and the pills. If you take away from the friends acting like the hosts were just a bit quirky, the movie was pretty well put together. Especially the lighting, there were dim lights all around the house in every scene apart from the kitchen table with the wine, in which the lights were bright adding some intensity and finally the climax to the movie. The ending scenes with everyone dying and fighting was also very well done, but it was not worth waiting the entire movie for it to happen. A few details did not make sense to me in the movie such as, the hosts letting Will see his dead son's room with the computer in it, he obviously was going to look through it after playing detective the entire movie. Also, everyone in the neighborhood takes part in the killing of their friends, but if Will had never moved out he would not have taken part in it, so how did they convince an entire area of California to kill all their closest friends. Finally, they should had been more clear when they were killing off people about who is dead and alive, because I thought it was just the Eden, David, Will, and Kira left.",The Invitation
484,heiditrego-60860,Definitely worth a watch,9,24 February 2020,"The invitation is a brilliant film in many ways, but also falls under some of those movie stereotypes we all know. I've seen a lot of other reviews claiming it was too slow to build up suspense or progress in the story, but I feel this is a necessary step to really connect with the film. The pace of the film allows you to witness the strange events that inevitably lead to the end of the film. For me, it felt like I was a guest at this ill-fated dinner party witnessing the events with the other characters in the movie. It allows you to guess and wonder what is going on instead of immediately throwing something obvious in your face. The pace of the film also allows you to connect with the characters and feel for what they have and currently are going through. You really start to root for the characters and worry for their outcome. Yes other horror films make you worry for the characters but you really get to know the characters in this film and connect with them as people instead of just characters in a horror movie. This connection definitely increases your anxiety when things turn south in the film. The sound in this film was really interesting to me. If you have seen the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then you understand how that movie uses very loud noises to create an uncomfortable feeling in its viewers throughout the film. The Invitation implements similar tactics by using sudden loud noises to create discomfort and also connect with the past trauma of one of the main characters. The lighting in this film also added a lot of mystery and tension with its use of shadows and softer lights. Finally, what really scared me about this movie is how the enemy is a very real thing that exists everywhere and can affect anyone. This information definitely scares me more than most films I watch. I would definitely recommend seeing this film.",The Invitation
485,stevenzeko,The Invitation to Dissatisfaction and Disappointment.,4,26 February 2020,"The suspenseful horror film The invitation (2015), directed by Karyn Kusama, was an almost flawlessly handled movie. The consonance between the anxiety and paranoia of the main character are all well-rationalized to match the same anxious, thick, and paranoid feelings that you may be feeling as you progress in place of the main character. The sense only amplifies as more evidence becomes apparent, even throughout the monumental amount of opposing feelings that his counterparts may be feeling when faced in the same situation. The director caresses you into opposing the cast and siding with the logical main character. I say this because this whole timeline of the seemingly logical protagonist (opposed to the illogically calm cast) is flipped. At this point, there is a dissonance that builds between you and the main character, and when he is finally correct, at a spilling climax, his episodes of anxiety and paranoia are well rewarded. The only issue in the beautiful handling of your psyche throughout the story is that you are not there to greet him in his climax of satisfaction. You are left with the dissatisfaction of following him through the story (which was attacked time and time again), and then the dissatisfaction of not staying on his side in the final climax when he is rewarded the justification of his actions. I feel that this was a fowl move on the director's part as you are not left satisfied with any part of this movie, so if you are hoping to gain satisfaction from this movie, you will surely be left disappointed. The final climax was also much too fast, which again, builds into the dissatisfaction of the movie as you are left no point to regain that connection with the main character. However, the story-line was unique and respectable, but not one worth being satisfied with.",The Invitation
486,arbazchaudhry-89518,Could have been better,3,26 February 2020,"The Invitation cleverly toys with the question of if a person completely let go, move on, and remain unaffected by past trauma. While the concept of an awkward dinner party is unique and attention-grabbing, the execution leaves the audience disappointed. Instead of a steady and productive building of the suspense, there is a sense of the movie simply just dragging. Most of the movie is shot in one location and focuses on polite conversation. To be blunt, it's slow, unlike most horror movies which typically cause you to be at the edge of your seat for a majority of the time. The Invitation does not succeed in making you feel fear. While Karyn Kusama managed to fill the screen with a heavy tone and forced positivity, there is a creepy mood that is established rather than a scary one. As a result, I firmly believe that this movie does not fall into the category of horror. The most development occurs in the last part of the movie when the real action happens. One of the main characters, Will, seems to be a mess of emotions. He acts suspicious, upset, confused, angry, paranoid, and unable to cope with*START SPOILER*facing his apparently now perfectly happy and peaceful ex-wife a few years after the death of his young son.*END SPOILER*The audience is set up to think that Will is sabotaging what appears to be an innocent and peaceful dinner party. At first, the audience sympathizes with Will as they see flashbacks of a traumatic event that he experienced. After some time, however, he is portrayed as a mood dampener and the audience finds it hard to make excuses for him. In reality, he turns out to be the sharpest of the group.",The Invitation
487,maryamzaffer,Too Slow,4,26 February 2020,"The Invitation is a psychological thriller with a relatively predictable plot as the audience can anticipate what the outcome will be quite quickly. While it seems that there is slow-building suspense that creates an overall unsettling mood, the audience is left waiting for when exactly things will turn for the worst at the dinner party. This makes The Invitation appear boring and unnecessarily drawn out. Most of the action takes place in the last half an hour of the movie. As a result, it would be more appropriate for this movie to be labeled as a thriller rather than as a horror movie. At the same time, there is no real dramatic twist as the ending occurs as expected. Low lighting adds to the mysterious nature of the seemingly innocent evening. Logan Marshall-Green's character, Will, is full of suspicion and makes numerous observations that add to the tension. With Will being in the house where his young son died and facing his ex-wife and her new husband, the audience questions his behavior as he appears to just be paranoid and traumatized. Questions about his past and the relationships between the guests are answered in a series of flashbacks and through conversations in the house. The red flags that Will repeatedly raises to the other guests are dismissed, but what happens when you are ""too polite,"" as Will claims?",The Invitation
488,lazerickstoklosa,Psycho/Slasher Thriller with a sick twist,10,26 February 2020,"The Invitation defies expectations for a movie that takes the audience slowly up a very steep hill to then drop rapidly back down, and I believe has every implication of Vera Dika's breakdown of slasher films. The movie takes place in the confines of a house in the Hollywood Hills, a house in which Will, the main character, and his ex-wife Eden experienced a past traumatic event, losing their son at their house party. The commemoration of that event is the invitation all the friends receive years later inviting them to a dinner at the same house. I believe the repressed people are Will, Eden and Eden's invitation members. They are all linked because they have all had traumatic experiences, and are trying to move on. The movie contains a lot of intertextuality, for instance, Will and Kira, Will's girlfriend, run into a coyote on the drive to the party. Instead of leaving the animal in pain and on the side of the road, Will strikes it in the head with a tire rod, killing it. This leads the audience up to the house feeling uneasy, and sets us up for a dinner party ready to turn for the worst leading to poison, guns, and blood. Will's killing of the coyote also brings intertextuality to the understanding of mercy. Mercy relates to The Invitation cult's duty to end the suffering of others. What turns this movie from good to excellent is Karyn Kusama's ending scene. The theme that life is filled with anxiety, depression and a sense of happiness as the final cut suggests that surviving one traumatic experience only leads to more of the same across the land.",The Invitation

It doesn't do it any justice, and some of the reviews I've read here don't make valid points in my opinion. So, I felt I owed this film my own review.First of all, the tension: man this thing has a killer build-up! You could call it slow (if you're a Transformers kind of guy), but it never gets ""boring"". You're on the edge of your seat from the moment the film starts, partly due to a very subtle but creepy soundtrack, which reminded me of sound effects in some of David Lynch's movies. Adding to that is the fantastic performance of Logan Marshall-Green as the tormented Will. He, and the events that follow, will keep you guessing about his mental health and whether his paranoia is justified or not, almost until the end. Michiel Huisman plays the very smooth and lulling host to great effect, and the rest of the group of friends is also very believable and natural.THE scene (no spoilers, you'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it!) was so well done I really had the feeling I was there. It all happens so slow, so eerily apropos, and so jaw-droppingly unexpected that you really get the feeling of ""oh my, that could be me out there"".

One could see this m movie as a critique to cults in general, but if so, it was done really poorly.. In general a very predictable and irritating movie, that's trying to be deeper than it really is and fails to deliver in all aspects. There are things happening all around our guests, but no one seems to notice except from our protagonist who is in grief. All the other ""normal"" guests are the stupidest people that could exist.*spoilers*Most suicide cults ask for consent. It is still a sick and criminal thing to do. Here we have no consent but only 4 people who want to die and decide to take their friends with them. We have no other explanation than ""we went to Mexico and met this Dr. something and he showed us the way out of our grief. We get no retort from the people who want to live. No judgment. They actually help the grieving mother who decided to kill them all gladly to fulfill her last will and ""go outside"" without any hesitation. Seriously? All of them? Even Kira who just met her that day and almost died because of her? People react so purely and unrealistically in this movie, except from the first woman who just left (most of us would have had either that reaction, or would have prepared ourselves for at least an orgy after that ""game""). The only reaction that Prouit gets after saying that he killed his wife (and only got 5 or 7 years of prison for some reason, though that just might be USA's legal system I have no idea) is a ""what the f@ck"". The only thing you can actually sympathize with in this movie is Wills reaction when he starts yelling at everyone that ""this doesn't feel safe"". Lastly, why in the end they show that this was an all around town phenomenon? They supposedly all met in Mexico and created the cult. Did all of them live in L.A or was this a national wide phenomenon? Why show it just to impress us and not give us answers? This is the most irritating thing about this movie, it's constantly presenting us things that make no sense and doesn't even try to justify them. It goes from ""Pain is a chemical reaction which can be controlled and ignored"" to ""I' ll just kill all my friends (for no apparent reason) and myself"" without any steps in between. This is actually pretty insulting to grieving people who struggle, even to people with attempted suicides, but that's beside the point. *end of spoilers*Long story sort, don't watch this movie it will just irritate you if you 're looking for anything that makes sense or provides you with food for thought.",The Invitation

It quickly becomes frustrating how no one other than Will understands that the cult glorifies and encourages suicide as a way to end one's suffering.That being said, I was very impressed with the way the cinematography was utilized to show a PTSD/dissociative response through the eyes of Will. The use of blurring effects, muted sounds, distortion of reality, and intermittent flashbacks during everyday tasks was effective in storytelling as much as it was accurate to how one would experience such trauma responses.",The Invitation

Very cliché film, one that the director probably showed his family on Halloween and only the dog liked it. The buildup lasts for about 85% of the film and then a small action sequence(one of the worst and most predictable yet) with an ending that YOU WILL PREDICT WITHIN THE FIRST 5 MINUTES.

The ending made it so much scarier for me though - after all the trauma and horror we just witnessed, you mean to say that's going on in multiple homes across LA?! The fact that it wasn't shown explicitly either added to the brilliance of it. The emotion shown really felt real, Will's pain made my heart hurt. You could feel how much his kids death broke him.

539,villanuevachristianrae,"The Invitation (2015) - ""An inviting psychological thriller""",8,31 December 2016,"A very inviting psychological thriller that's what I call ""The Invitation"". The Invitation is about Will who was invited in a dinner party by his ex-wife, Eden who is now living a blissful life with her new husband, but what's strange about the set-up of the reunion is Will and their common friends only receives an invite after two years, out of the blue. Revelations begins as the story unfolds during the dinner party. Calmness and peacefulness of the atmosphere was created effortlessly with help of the smiles of the guest, and laughter of the host couple, but the only thing that's killing the vibe of the party is Will's paranoia with her ex-wife. He begins to imagine things out of the blue, and starts reminiscing her horrific moments with Eden. The film is great when it leaves the audience wandering along with Will in the house every time he walks out of the crowd. Every minimal movements makes you think if Will is right, or he is just mistaking his imagination with reality.The invitation is a slow-burn horror, but there's no dull moment because of how well the characters was crafted because you can truly relate to them, everyone has different personalities that the audience will enjoy watching. The unfolding of the mystery in the end is very spellbinding; you keep clingy to the moment. Especially, the moment when the new husband of Eden already releases his gun to reveal that everything on Will's mind is true. A good psychological thriller well crafted from beginning to end.",The Invitation
540,lindykay-62773,Huge disappointment (Contains Spoiler),2,9 April 2016,"I forked over $6.99 to see this ""tense, psychological thriller"" on VOD after my newspaper wrote a glowing review. I was extremely disappointed. The filmmakers effectively create a suffocating level of tension and creepiness. The viewer is continually guessing what is really going on. What I imagined was going on was more interesting that what actually happened.**Spoiler Alert**The disturbing tone was set in the first scene when the characters needlessly run over a coyote and then had to kill it to put it out of its misery. Why such gratuitous animal cruelty? It had nothing to do with the story. The climactic ending made me think Quentin Tarantino had wandered on set and decided to take over. Hello? When did this movie turn into ""Django Unchained""? The final scene had me wondering, ""Oh, so this is a commentary on violence in our society?"" I was actually relieved to be out of that suffocating house with the bars on the windows and the locks on the doors. The sirens were like a breath of fresh air. Whew! There's a world out there. And how exactly were Will and Kira able to carry crazy Eden outside and dump her in the yard when no one could get out of the house during the murderous rampage? Did she have a key in her flowing white gown? (You always know that the character in white is going to be blood soaked before it's all over.)Finally, if I were at that dinner party I would have left within minutes. Granted, some sadistic bald guy who parked behind me would not have let me leave, but at least I would have tried. I kept wondering why everyone stuck around long after it got seriously creepy. It just didn't ring true. I want my money back.",The Invitation

The story leads you to constantly question what is really happening at any given moment, and whenever you are certain that you know exactly what is going to happen, something new appears to make you question that. There is a powerful and intense atmosphere of dread and stress throughout, all building to a terrifying conclusion, but I was taken unawares by how emotional the whole thing would be. This is a very poignant film. The characters seem real, and the performances are excellent, especially from the lead, Logan Marshall-Green. This film casts a very potent spell and I can say that days later I am still thinking about it. I can't think of anything quite like it.

The whole film revolves around the correlation between pain and the way of tackling it which is Masonry. Masonry is initially taken as the ""treatment,cure"" to the agony and anguish experienced beforehand by the characters. However, it turns out that mostly it wrecks the person instead of salivating him or her. I think it was genius and extraordinary to expand Masonry in this film since it was not something to exploit in film industry.It is initially about sharing something, loving all without judging and without any gender distinctions.But at the end it comes to the fact that it also involves death as redemption and is against human nature and nearly all religions in the world as murder not psychologically recovers you and that no matter how shitty your life is you always get away from death.

The time this movie needs to show you the different background stories and relations between the characters is not in balance with the quick, almost hurried up ending that's just basically a quick showdown of who gets to die and how.The biggest let down for me, besides the ending, was John Carroll Lynch's casting. The man is a great actor but not for the role of Pruitt. Supporting the scenes with that frightening stare of his, almost like a suburban Pennywise, I hoped a more interesting and for the movie more important role for him.My golden rule with this kind of cinema: the ending is everything.

No matter how much wine you give someone you show them a video of someone dying and tell them you're in a cult, i'm betting the bank they're not staying for dinner dessert or post dessert poison shots.

557,ndfreek,Skip dinner with your ex next time,8,24 February 2020,"Karyn Kusama's 2015 film The Invitation is not only a riveting take on grief and what we do with our feelings of grief. The film masterfully uses its initial first act to build tension slowly, inching the viewer closer and closer to the edge; until the film tosses you off a cliff into a disturbing fever dream of paranoia and dread. Kusama's intent to push the horror-thriller genre out of its complacency with PG-13, jump scare fueled, stalker money grabs pays off exceptionally well as she manages to create not only one of the best horror films of the 2010's, but thrillers as well.In the same vein as 2017's Get Out, the film is centered around an innocent enough event - a dinner party. The dialogue in this film is outstandingly presented in an authentic manner, making the entire situation all the more believable. The film also offers a fantastic look at our attitudes towards old relationships and the lengths some people may go to in order to save face. Logan Marshall-Green (Will) gives a fantastic performance, and is able to convey the sheer self doubt and uneasiness the audience is also having while viewing the film.All in all, The Invitation is not only a thought provoking film on the challenges humans may have coping with grief, but also the conviction we have to remain uncontroversial and not say anything until it's too late. However, the biggest lesson to take away from all of this might just be to never have dinner with your ex again.",The Invitation

If you want a good suspense, what is going on?!, kind of movie, watch this! It has elements of 50's suspense movies, but with a modern twist. The actor who played Will should be nominated, in a ton of other movies.... something! He had me engaged the entire time. I really didn't expect to love this movie this much. Nicely done.",The Invitation

Anyone who knows about spirit animals will get the clue about how it will unfold.",The Invitation

581,fnanavati,Legitimately the worth thriller I have ever seen,1,30 July 2018,"I thought this was going to be interesting with deep meaning or some mysterious twists, but it has no story line and is extremely shallow. The movie has an increasing amount of jump scares and flashbacks, to only end with a ridiculous conclusion. Would never recommend to anyone.",The Invitation
582,gluon_painter,"Built up nice suspense, but too slow. Wasted the good cinematography.",4,16 June 2021,"The pace could have been tighter. I loved the suspense built up with the directing, music, and tone at first.But after 30 minutes, it's still going a bit too slowly. The ending is a bit predictable yet the execution didn't come with a bang to cover up the loss.Overall, nice cinematography and acting wasted on a bad plot and direction.",The Invitation
583,dlresh,Worth Watching,9,13 October 2018,"Overall a nice movie to watch.
I did not have great expectations from this movie as the rating was low.
.But I must say it exceeded my expectations.
Acting wise also good.",The Invitation
584,sammtherock,Not for Europeans but hey...,6,29 October 2018,"The movie shows a scenary in which most europeans would walk out of right after drinking that glass of wine. That's not to talk bad about anyone, don't get me wrong but it's just not plausable that folks would stick arrownd in that house after such obvious hints that you shouldn't have honored the invitation.
If the plot sounds appealing for you, watch it, towards the end you're going to say...""yeah"".
Having gotten that out of the way, the movie shows a tight location and good cast but overall, slight dissapointing.",The Invitation

587,wubz,Should have declined,4,30 November 2018,"The one thing I will praise about this movie is the suspense. The biggest problem for me is the plot. First off, what sane person would bring their new significant other (and them being perfectly fine with this idea) to their ex's dinner party in the house you lived in whom you had a child with that passed away in an accident? Within minutes of arriving, the main character notices red flags everywhere that something isn't right. By the time the crazy bald man shares his story of him killing his wife and them showing the cult video of a woman dying, any person with a working brain would have been out of there.If the plot was different like just a get together with old friends I would have rated it higher.",The Invitation
588,kmcday,Good Late Night Watch,7,6 January 2019,"Very good movie but moves slowly AND was frustrating for me. The large plot hole takes place throughout the majority of the movie. Several times the man mentions he doesn't feel safe and that something odd is going on and yet he never leaves. They are locked into this home with bars on the windows and the man points these things out and still stays for dinner/desert, was he really that hungry? He willingly not only keeps himself, but also his girlfriend, in this unsafe environment. This honestly annoyed me throughout the entire film and the only thing I could come up with as his reason to stay is that his dead son is connected to the home. And of course the ending leaves loose ends. I dislike loose ends. I want to know why this cult felt the need to kill others in order to ""transcend""? Even if it is a stupid cult logic, I wish they would have ended with the cult video explaining the need for the massacre. Dispite these things I would still recommend this film to others.",The Invitation
