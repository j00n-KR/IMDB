0,MartinHafer,A pretty good film except it really ISN'T a romance.,7,9 November 2021,"""An Officer and a Gentleman"" shows what life in Navy Aviation Officer Candidate School is like...at least back in 1982. I have a STRONG feeling that much of what the Gunnery Sergeant (Lou Gossett) said in the film wouldn't fly today, in this more politically correct world.The film follows Zack Mayo (Richard Geer) from just before entering the school until its completion. Along the way, this lone wolf somehow comes to think of others and care about them...which seems a bit out of character.This is a very good film in many ways. It is very interesting watching these candidates go through school as well as how some are washed out of the program. So, as a drama it works well. But, as a romance, it's simply NOT a romance. After all, Zack is a selfish guy and he uses his girlfriend (Deborah Winger) throughout the film with no intention to marry her or concern about her feelings. Then, inexplicably, at the end he declares his undying love for her...which just seems like the film is following conventions, not staying true to this character. Had there been a slow transformation, this change in Zach would have worked...but as it is, it just seemed formulaic but not realistic.Overall, it's a very watchable film which has a couple deficits...mainly how the main character was written as well as the annoying ever-present strains from the hit song ""Up Where We Belong""...which, after a while, becomes tiresome.",An Officer and a Gentleman
1,bkoganbing,"""I Don't Know, But I've Been Told........""",9,20 November 2011,"The players make this one something special. Without the fine performances from this great ensemble cast, An Officer And A Gentleman would be just another flag waving recruiting film from Hollywood. Richard Gere along with such various and diverse people as David Keith, Tony Plana, and one female recruit Lisa Eilbacher are training to be Naval Pilots and they've got a Marine gunnery sergeant putting them through their paces during the training near Puget Sound. The sergeant is Lou Gossett, Jr. and he's looking for whatever weaknesses, academic, physical, professional or moral to wash them out of the program.The film turns on the conflict between Gere and Gossett. Gere thinks he's something special and Gossett is going to prove to him he's not. Gere shows he does have the right stuff, take careful note of the scene on the confidence course with Lisa Eilbacher where he shows he's not just about himself.Gossett casts so well in military parts, but this one set the standard for playing training sergeants. Many have done it before, but Gossett's is the best by far. His peers must have thought so because not only did he win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for 1982, but Gossett beat out two Hollywood veterans either James Mason for The Verdict or Robert Preston for Victor/Victoria should have been a sentimental favorite. The moral failings in the trainees are brought out by town girls Debra Winger and Lisa Blount. Both are types that Gossett warns his trainees about, town girls who are on the make and want to trap a glamorous Navy Pilot to get out of their factory town. Not too much different from sorority girls at Ivy League schools looking to snare a husband. Winger and Blount go after Gere and Keith respectively. It ends in tragedy for one of them. Debra got a Best Actress nomination, but lost to Meryl Streep for Sophie's Choice.I wish somehow David Keith had been given some recognition. For me his is the most touching performance in the whole film. He's doing the program out of some sense of instilled obligation, not really because he wants to. It's between this and the country kid prisoner part that Keith did so well in Brubaker as being his career roles.An Officer And A Gentleman got a few more nominations in technical categories, but 1982 was the year of Gandhi which was the big winner. But it did receive a second Oscar for Best Song with Up Where We Belong which was a big old hit that year. You could hardly go anywhere without hearing Jennifer Warren's hit on somebody's radio. No contest in the voting in that category.There have been a lot of films about military training, but the special performances by the whole cast make An Officer And A Gentleman a really outstanding film, the best in the genre.",An Officer and a Gentleman
2,SnoopyStyle,terrific characters in classic romance,8,9 November 2015,Zack Mayo (Richard Gere) has a dysfunctional relationship with his drunken Navy father (Robert Loggia). He joins the Navy to fly jets. His father thinks he won't complete the needed six years. He arrives at Port Rainier with a chip on his shoulder and schemes to make money. Sgt. Emil Foley (Louis Gossett Jr.) aims to break down the class. He befriends fellow recruits Sid Worley (David Keith) and Casey Seeger (Lisa Eilbacher). He's physically superior but lacks the school skills. Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger) and Lynette Pomeroy (Lisa Blount) are local factory girls.Richard Gere fits this character. He has the perfect blend of cockiness and vulnerability. David Keith is great and Louis Gossett Jr. embodies the classic hard-nosed mentor role. I also love Seeger's journey. Debra Winger adds substance to a possible weak point. This is a classic romance of the era.,An Officer and a Gentleman
3,mark.waltz,"If he looks like an officer and acts like an officer, well, he's probably an officer.",8,28 December 2020,"Don't let the opening scene of this crowd pleasing drama fool you. Richard Gere's character of Zack Mayo (""Mayonnaise"", his nickname by the tough talking drill sergeant Louis Gossett Jr.) is far more office material than his scene with Robert Loggia (as his father) would insinuate. Loggia is crass, even for a CPO, and it is obvious that Mayo wants to get as far away from him and better his circumstances as much as possible. He has a college degree, something his father obviously disrespects him for, preferring a ""good old boy"" for a son, and upset by the fact that somehow Gere has grown up to be a gentleman. However, his past seems to be against him as he immediately attracts the dislike of Gossett's tough sergeant who goes out of his way to make it seem impossible for him to ever get his stripes.This film not only helped raise Gere to the ranks of superstardom after a handful of decent films (especially 1979's sleeper drama ""Yanks""), and if his box office for ""American Gigolo"" was any indication, Gere was guaranteed to be a favorite once this was released, reviewed and ranked at the top of 1982 box office hits. It also found a hit for another rising star, Debra Winger, who went from the shy girl finding surprise romance in ""Thank God It's Friday"" to Travolta's feisty co-star in ""Urban Cowboy"", and while she comes into the picture after the story gets going, once she does, it is impossible to take your eyes off of her. She got the Oscar Nomination (not Gere unfortunately during a year of crowded contenders), but together, they are dynamite.Then there's the supporting cast. Gossett is every recruit's nightmare, and while his motives are a bit suspect in his seeming hatred for Gere, what comes out of these candidates has indeed made him tougher, and when he tells Gere at the end, ""Get the Hell out of Here!"", you know there's a bit of pride in the way he says it that he did what he had to do to help Gere find himself and make it through. He may be a nasty piece of work at times while doing his job (and some of his actions are questionable as far as military practices are concerned), but Gossett really comes through with one of the most unforgettable movie performances of all times that along with his role in ""Roots"" makes him not only one of the best black actors of all time, but certainly one of the best actors period, leading or supporting.There's also a fantastic performance by David Keith who could easily have been nominated for an Oscar as well as Gere's pal who finds out the hard way that being an officer and a gentleman isn't always what its cracked up to be when he learns the truth about the girl he falls in love with, played with an amoral coolness by the excellent Lisa Blount. The scene where Winger learns the truth about her supposed best friend and how she reacts to it is one of the best moments of accountability ever seen on screen. Grace Zabriskie, as Winger's mother, is also very good, indicating a life of regret and showing a sadness over the life of what women like this surrounding an officer's naval base have to deal with, and Winger really shows the independence in her character by being determined to break the chain that has obviously influenced the women in her family for generations.When I first saw this film, I was certain that the character played by Lisa Eilbacher was really Cindy Williams, and it took several years for me afterwards to realize that it wasn't. I enjoyed the subplot of Gere making her a pal and helping her deal with Gossett's supposed tyranny, and this adds a bit of comical twists to the sometimes dark story that isn't always pleasant to watch. The twists concerning one of the stories really will have you reaching for a Kleenex which makes the emotions of the final scene all the better. ""Up Where We Belong"" ends up being one of the very best movie theme songs ever written, and while the ending has been imitated many times, this is how it should be done. It is an old fashioned romantic drama in many ways that nearly 40 years later has an impact on how films like this are done, and when someone gets it right, it is obvious what film influenced them.",An Officer and a Gentleman
4,kosmasp,A long way to go,8,15 March 2021,"As another reviewer has stated, the movie is one that has a reputation at film schools, mostly for its script. Obviously that does not mean you will fully agree with this, but the movie sets the tone from the start. It shows us exactly what and why our main character is damaged. Why it is not just a flip of the switch that can be done to rid him of his issues and anxieties ... not to mention father issues in general.I reckon some may feel this is or can be seen as a recruitment tool for the army. Maybe in some sense or some underlying tone this was meant to be that way. But if you deflect from what this is really about (a man finally becoming a man, military not withstanding), you may miss the point and not enjoy the movie and the message it sends.And just because this has an uplifting message overall doesn't mean it doesn't get grim. It also doesn't mean it can't get sexual. Though to be honest I would call it sensual - the one scene here where lovemaking takes place that is. And you should call it that, not just because of political correctness, but because it really does feel like two persons in love, share their passion very intimately! One of the most ""hot"" love scenes put on film, while not being graphic (some nudity involved).But all this only works because of the phenomenal acting. Luis Gossett Jr. puts on a display here, that may have been inspired by an Apocalypse Now character! Overall very fine acting jobs throughout, even if one female character seems to have picked up the short straw ... being villanous and having a turn towards the end that is anything but redeeming. But those small ""flaws"" throughout, if you care for them are not going to spoil the movie for you ...",An Officer and a Gentleman
5,lee_eisenberg,your mommy isn't here to help you,5,15 April 2017,"I've never served in the armed forces, so I can't vouch for the accuracy of the events depicted in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". What I can say is that it's an intense movie but the ending has to be one of the corniest endings ever scripted and filmed. Otherwise it's a good movie, as Richard Gere's new recruit enlists in the US navy and experiences a grueling regimen at the hands of gunnery sergeant Louis Gossett Jr. (Fiddler on ""Roots""). The whole part about the local women wanting to hook up with the navy men doesn't stick in my mind as much, but if you're looking for great shots of the Olympic Peninsula, this is the movie for you.The rest of the cast includes Debra Winger, David Keith (the dad in ""Firestarter""), Tony Plana (the dad on ""Ugly Betty"") and Robert Loggia.",An Officer and a Gentleman
6,jboothmillard,An Officer and a Gentleman,6,14 September 2005,"Everyone knows the ending of this film, but I only remembered bits and pieces of the film besides that, so when I got the opportunity to watch it again I was pay much closer attention and gain a decent opinion, from director Taylor Hackford (Dolores Claiborne, The Devil's Advocate, Ray). Basically Zachary 'Zack' Mayo (Golden Globe nominated Richard Gere) had a hard childhood and adolescence while growing up, with his mother committing suicide, and his father, who admittedly did not want the responsibility, becoming his official guardian, while also serving as a Naval seaman in the Philippines, so he grew up with no real guidance, a true home and adult responsibility. As a young man Zack has enlisted in the Navy himself in the hopes of becoming a jet fighting officer, the program starts at the air naval station on Whidbey Island, Washington with a thirteen week series of training regimes, he is hoping to take the easiest route as possible, even bending the rules and cutting corners. The drill instructor Sergeant Emil Foley (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Louis Gossett Jr.) is having none of it though, he appears to enjoy humiliating the recruits, especially Zack, trying to eliminate the weaker candidates and force them to DOR (drop on request), of course as time goes by they all try to go out of their way to prove their strengths. The recruits are all warned of the ""Puget Debs"", these are the local girls who work in the near drab factory an escape this trying to lure and trap the candidates, ignoring this Zack meets Paula Pokrifki (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Debra Winger) and his best friend among the other candidates Sid Worley (Golden Globe nominated David Keith) meets Lynette Pomeroy (Lisa Blount). Zack does indeed prove himself to Sergeant Foley and completes the thirteen weeks without DORing, he even comes to admit to the commanding officer his reasons for wanting to be in the Navy, and meanwhile his relationship with Paula teaches him lessons of what it truly means to be grown up. There comes the lowest point when Sid commits suicide, following a rejected marriage and no real baby by Lynette, she just wanted to marry a Naval officer, Zack wants to DOR, but Foley will not let him as he is close to graduation, and the two men end up clashing in an unofficial martial arts fight, with Foley winning kicking him in the groin. In the end Zack turns up to the graduation and is sworn into the Navy by Foley, now officially an officer and in the white uniform he is to begin flight training, but before this he seeks out Paula in the factory she works, they kiss and he picks her up and walks out with her in his arms, with the workers including Lynette applauding, and as they walk out Laura takes Zack's hat off to wear on her own head. Also starring Robert Loggia as Byron Mayo, Lisa Eilbacher as Casey Seeger, Ugly Betty's Tony Plana as Emiliano Della Serra, Harold Sylvester as Perryman, David Caruso as Topper Daniels, Victor French as Joe Pokrifiki, Grace Zabriskie as Esther Pokrifiki, Tommy Petersen as Young Zack and Mara Scott Wood as Bunny. Gere, despite being a wooden actor, obviously became a big star and a sex symbol following this film, highly successful in it's time, and Gossett with his time on screen proves a worthy winner of the supporting actor Oscar, the girl loves man in uniform format certainly works, I admit I found the boot camp stuff more interesting, but the love story element has it's moments too, it is a likable romantic drama. It won the Oscar for Best Song for Up Where We Belong"" (also won the BAFTA and Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Music for Jack Nitzsche and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Score, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Richard Gere was number 76 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 43 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 68 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, and it was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Good!",An Officer and a Gentleman
7,rmax304823,"Shine That Buckle, Mister.",6,10 May 2007,"""An Officer and a Gentleman."" Good title. It pretty much sums up the story of Richard Gere's aviation midshipman undergoing a tough training course in the Northwest. He comes from a seedy background and is mean and selfish. He meets a girl from the nearby factory, Deborah Winger, whom he relies on for sex and comfort during his 12-weeks of misery. She, in turn, is the daughter of an unknown aviation cadet in a class twenty-two years ago, and is looking for a way out of this dead-end existence through marriage to a naval aviator. The two meet at a dance, exit the premises, go down to the beach and boff -- he for kicks, she because she's loose and likes him. Will Richard Gere overcome his egocentricity? Will he graduate as an ensign and go on to flight school? Will he realize that his feelings for Winger are more than those he would feel for just another play toy? Will be become an ""officer"" AND a ""gentleman""? Answer: You don't need a Magic 8-ball.It's kind of an interesting movie. It's certainly one of Gere's best performances. Under the torment of Lou Gossett Jr.'s Gunnery Sergeant, he's at one point reduced to a mud-covered tortured shambles and screams out abjectly, ""I got no place else to GO!"" His face is all twisted out of its handsomeness and his usual arrogance is nowhere in sight.Winger's role is rather more complicated. If Gere's principal concern must shift from himself to the other members of the team, well, it does so on cue. But Winger's motives are ambiguous from the beginning, even to herself. She's interested in Gere from the start, yes, but she's also interested in HER career as an ordinary bourgeois, fixing bacon and eggs for her man in some exotic locale perhaps, bearing him children. Her motives don't change so much as they intensify as she comes to bond with Gere. And yet, rather than trap him with a false pregnancy or something, she's willing to give him up when he shows signs of reluctance to pursue their affair beyond the stage of an amuse-bouche.Speaking of fake pregnancies, that's part of the subplot involving David Keith, a fellow classmate, and HIS girlfriend, one of Winger's coworkers at the factory. Keith gives up everything for his supposedly pregnant partner, resigns from the Navy, buys her a wedding ring and immediately proposes marriage so he can take her back to meet the family in Oklahoma where he has a job as floor manager waiting for him at J. C. Penny. FLOOR MANAGER? She is waiting for bread and he brings her stones. Like any sensible shark, she tells him what he can do with his wedding ring. After he goes to a motel and does it, he hangs himself.There is a terrific martial arts slug out at the end in which Gossett, the instructor, manages to save himself only be delivering a hard kick to Gere's family jewels. I haven't quite figured that out yet. Why was an unfair blow necessary? Granted that Gere must discover that he can be defeated. As far as maturity goes, he has a lot of catching up to do. But surely he knows by now that life is unfair, so he doesn't need a painful reminder. Is it just that the writers didn't want to risk showing Richard Gere being beaten in a fair fight? That's kind of how it looks. By the way, writers, when a man is kicked there he doesn't fall to the ground in a fetal position and choke. He falls to the ground in a fetal position and screams bloody murder.The script is part of the problem with this film. Absolutely nobody could be as naive and stupid as David Keith's midshipman. He's a nice guy but he doesn't seem to have any insight at all, into himself or into others. He doesn't deserve to be a naval aviator. He deserves to be a Steward's Mate Third Class.It's as if the writers figured something like, let's put Richard Gere through midshipman training so we can watch him suffer, and then we'll have him fall for Deborah Winger. This schematic skeleton is then fitted out with disproportionate, sometimes flabby limbs and extrusions. The script really needed some buffing, at least as much as a midshipman's buckle. It's a colorful movie, with plenty of interesting action and some nice performances, but it's a bit sloppily done.",An Officer and a Gentleman
8,Tweekums,Gere at his best,8,29 June 2014,"Zack Mayo is the son of a US Navy Petty Officer; a drunk who had abandoned his mother when she became pregnant. When she killed herself Zack followed his father to the Philippines where he got on in life the hard way. Now he is an adult he is determined to make more of himself than his father did to become a naval aviator to become an officer and a gentleman. Before he can do that though he must pass the thirteen week course at the Aviation Officer Candidate School where those who don't have what it takes are weeded out. His instructor Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley doesn't think he has what it takes but he will push him and the rest of the class to the limit to find out. Zack befriends fellow student Sid Worley and the two of them start dating Paula and Lynette, a pair of local girls, despite Foley's warning that the local girls are all trying to get married to a pilot by fair means or foul.This film may be well known as a romance, largely due to the famous final scene, but it is far more than just that. In fact the most important relationship in the film is that between Mayo and Foley; Foley may be pushing Mayo to quit but without him he'd never get through the course; what at first appears to be bullying turns out to be the impetus needed to get through the gruelling training programme. Louis Gossett, Jr. certainly earned the Oscar he won for his performance as Foley and Gere is at his best as Mayo whose character develops from a selfish loner to that of somebody willing to help his classmates at his own expense. The rest of the cast are pretty good too; most notably David Keith who plays Sid and Debra Winger who plays Paula. For the most part we can guess how the story will ultimately end but that doesn't make it an entirely feel-good film; there is tragedy too and that comes as quite a shock. Overall an enjoyable film; well worth watching especially if you are a fan of Richard Gere.",An Officer and a Gentleman
9,ma-cortes,Appealing and charming film with strongly effective interpretations and a highly emotive ending,7,17 August 2020,"Zack Mayo (Richard Gere) is a young man who has signed up for Navy Aviation Officer Candidate School , he enters at school because he doesn't know what else to do with his life , as he wants to become an aviator , while his father (Robert Loggia) being a womanizer , drunk and bad soldier . Gunnery Sergeant Emil Foley (Louis Gosset Jr. winning a deserved Academy Award as the stiff-upper-lip commander) is the boot drill instructor who has to train and evaluate the newcomer recruits , and will clearly find Zack wishing to prepare himself . As recruits are taken to their limits on a training course and a lot of it is pretty abrasive stuff . Along the way Zack meets Paula (Debra Winger) , his love interest , a girl who has little beyond family , and must decide what it is he wants to do with his life while becomes a better person despite himself . Eventually , he gets the help of the two-fisted Gunnery Sergeant and his new girlfriend .A decent romantic/soap opera movie made this ¨An officer and a Knight¨ a ¨must watch¨ in 1982 that is still attractive but extremely sentimental and corny . One of the oldest plots released in Hollywood , especially in the Golden Age , perhaps that's why it works so well . Well worth watching in spite of the standard Hollywood premise , usual elements and wrapped package of commercial ingredients . Although Soap Opera has never been art , this one results to be entertaining , stirring , dated and predictable too . Richard Gere and Debra Winger take the romantic genre as close to it as any of the past three-hankerchief classics . Richard Gere gives an acceptable acting as a young drifter becomes a brat recruit who has a bad attitude problem while attempting to complete his work at the Navy Officer Candidate School .Gorgeous Debra Winger provides a really sensitive and emotive performance. Special mention for Louis Gosset Jr as the tough sergeant who whips him into shape . Furthermore , David Keith as his kind Catholic friend with real feeling and Lisa Blount as the ambitious girl who sets her sights on marrying him . And other brief interpretations from fine secondaries as Robert Loggia , Lisa Eilbacher , Graze Zabrinski , Victor French , David Caruso , Ed Begley Jr , John Laughlin , Tony Plana and Harold Sylvester .It contains sensitive and exciting musical score but composed by means of synthesizer by Jack Nitzsche and it won an Academy Ward for best song : Up where we belong sung by Joe Cocker . As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by Donald Thorin . Filmmaker Taylor Hackford keeps just the right balance between the sublime and the embarrasssing , making this one one of the best of its kind . However, being rated ¨Parents Guide¨ for abundant profanity , nudism , and simulated sex . This director Taylor Hackford is a good professional , producing , writing and shooting , as he has made notorious films of all kinds of genres, such as : Parker , Ray , Proof of life , Dolores Clairbone , against all odds , Chuck Berry Hail Hail Rock , The idol maker , White nights , among others . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average . Worthwhile seeing for Richard Gere and Debra Winger fans .",An Officer and a Gentleman
10,moonspinner55,The same military formula as before...,3,19 October 2007,"Director Taylor Hackford's crackpot Boot Camp melodrama takes place in the present day, but it has all the musty clichés you'd expect from such a scenario (Hackford really is a hack; he doesn't even try to revitalize the clichés, he merely disguises them with new-fangled handling, bad language and sex included). Richard Gere manages to escape his rough-hewn, hard-partying father by enlisting in Navy flight school, but his drill sergeant appears to hate him on sight. Oscar-winner Louis Gossett Jr. plays the sneering, appalled gunnery sergeant with absolutely no let-up, and with no regard to all the impersonations of this same character from past history (he's yet another cliché, who naturally uses the old ""are you a man?"" line--only here it becomes ""steers and queers""). Debra Winger has a threadbare role as a man-chaser who only wants to land an officer; she's around to make Gere swoon and contemplate his heart. The actual relationship in the movie, the one at the forefront of the action, lies in the masochistic one between the stubborn recruit and the sergeant who wants to break him. It's a stale throwback without much humor or heart, only sweat. *1/2 from ****",An Officer and a Gentleman
11,sunwarrior13,A Coming Of Age Military Film,9,15 September 2012,"An Officer and a Gentleman is a film that tells the story of a U.S. Navy aviation officer candidate who comes into conflict with the Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant who trains him. It starred Richard Gere, Debra Winger and Louis Gossett, Jr.It was written by Douglas Day Stewart and directed by Taylor Hackford.Zack Mayo, an aloof, taciturn man who aspires to be a navy pilot. Once he's arrived at training camp for his 13-week officer's course, Mayo runs afoul of abrasive, no-nonsense drill sergeant Emil Foley. Mayo --or ""Mayonnaise,"" as he is dubbed by the irascible Foley -- is an excellent cadet, but a little cold around the heart. Foley rides Mayo mercilessly, sensing that the young man would be prime officer material if he weren't so self-involved. Zack's affair with working girl Paula Pokrifi is likewise compromised by his unwillingness to give of himself. Only after Mayo's best friend Sid Worsley commits suicide over an unhappy romance does Zack come out of his shell and mature into a real human being.The movie succeeds as both a magical love story and as a convincing portrait of one individual's passage into manhood.It one of those coming of age film that is set in the military.And it has been popular for many years now since it only proves that change remains a timeless theme in films.",An Officer and a Gentleman
12,hitchcockthelegend,"Don't believe the naysayers, this is a true uplifter.",9,25 April 2009,"Zack Mayo, after years of being shunted around with his woman chasing, alcoholic naval father, decides to up sticks and join the navy himself. He plans to fly jets and enrols at a tough Naval Aviation Officer Candidate School. Very much a loner and used to doing things his own way, Zack must tow the line if he is to succeed. Forming friendships and taking on a romance with a local girl, he may just make the grade. But he has to convince not only his tough no nonsense drill instructor, but also himself.An Officer And A Gentleman has been bogged down over the years by being labelled as a chick flick, a film they say, that is for the soggy handkerchief brigade. Not so say I. Yes love is a critical strand here, not only finding it after years of being closed off from it, but also to keep it after seizing the day. But it's as much a film about determination as it is about conquering love, in finding strengths from within to achieve ones goals against seemingly badly stacked odds. It really is a film that essays that triumph of the will spirit so lacking in many similar pictures that followed this 1982 piece. There are some incredibly great sequences here, chiefly during the training programme, from Mayo's continuing conflict with Sgt Foley, to a devastating turn of events with a friendship. This film royally packs an emotional punch.The cast are uniformly excellent, Richard Gere as Mayo is pitch perfect and it pays to notice that he was a 32 year old man playing an early 20s rookie, it's a testament to his undervalued ability that nobody noticed. Debra Winger was nominated for a Best Actress Award for her portrayal as Mayo's love interest, Paula Pokrifki. It's believed that Gere and herself didn't get on off screen, it isn't noticeable, though, because the chemistry sizzles and the resulting end product is one of a joyous returns. Honours have to go to Louis Gossett Jr., though, rightly winning the Best Supporting Actor Award, his performance as instructor Sgt Foley is towering and one of the best of the 1980s. David Keith and Lisa Eilbacher also turn in strong performances, and Taylor Hackford's direction is smooth and without intrusion. The involving screenplay and tidy editing are also noteworthy, and the theme song ""Up where We Belong"" took home the gong for Best Original Song.Some critics have called the film sexist, oh come off it people! It may come as a shock to them but a lot of women do actually want to be carried off by some dashing hunk, similarly, a lot of us men are more than willing to be the ones carrying the maiden! And lest we forget that the characterisations here carry much depth. 9/10",An Officer and a Gentleman

Anyone got any ideas how to reverse this ? "" "" Hey let's make a relatively cheap film that'll appeal to both boys and girls . Maybe we could bring out an official soundtrack album in order to market the movie . Free publicity via the pop charts "" I use the word genius literally . Simple genius at that . It's a film that will appeal to red blooded men and women . The only problem is that by the time TOP GUN became a massive hit the film makers at Hollywood studios had become addicted to this so much cross genre of later years like PEARL HARBOR were in danger of sinking the Hollywood studios . Perhaps if they concentrated on character they would have saved themselves a lot of money Looking back on this movie it's surprising how hard edged it is . If you've only seen the TV version it's something of a shock to hear the F word uttred a few times. The locations are also very gloomy and the characters aren't entirely likable or played by people from a model agency . In short there's a large amount of realism involved or least compared to its successors . What does let the film down slightly is a couple of cheesy scenes such as the climatic scene where two characters pop off somewhere "" Not to talk "" .

15,AlsExGal,If you sleep with enough strangers you too can find a man with a good future to take you away from all of this...,8,24 July 2017,"... or at least that seems to be the lesson to working class girls like Paula (Debra Winger) and Lynnette (Lisa Blount) who have the problem of only having a high school education and thus limited employment options in the remote rural place in which they live, but access to the droves of young men going through officer candidate school nearby. The catch - they are only there for 13 weeks, and isolated on base without leave for the first four. With the final scene being somewhat iconic - I won't spoil it for you but I'm sure you'll recognize it being parodied somewhere before - it does seem to be that my review title is the lesson for young women here. That and cheaters (Lynette) never prosper.This is a great time capsule and probably the film you should watch if you want a taste of the Reagan revolution of the early 1980s. The most significant feature of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is that contemporary reviewers saw nothing unusual about it. The use of sex and nudity marks what has been incorporated from the counter cultural revolution, but the politics have shifted to the right so quietly that no one noticed. It's entirely possible that the writer and director could truthfully deny that they had intended to make a pro-Reagan film. With appealing stars like Richard Gere and Debra Winger, salvation through military service could even seem to be hip.It's also a taste of something we lost at the end of the draft. I'm not saying that a military draft would be the least bit practical with the highly technical armed forces we have now. But look what we have here - people from all walks of life being forged together into a cohesive unit, aware but unbothered by the differences between them. Zack (Richard Gere), losing a mother to suicide as a child, foisted upon an unwilling father by the Navy, and growing up over a Filipino whorehouse, learning martial arts to defend himself against the roving street gangs. Of course he came to the navy a selfish jerk - he needed that quality to survive as a kid. Zack's best buddy (David Keith as Sid) is an Okie from Muskogee, a guy so traditional he is living his dead brother's life for him just because his parents want it that way. Then there is Perryman, their bunk mate. He appears to be a little older, maybe almost 30, but being a naval aviator is the only way he can see to get up and into a secure future for his wife and kids. Then there is Emiliano Della Serra (Tony Plana), a soft spoken mathematics graduate from Texas, Hispanic and every inch of five feet. In high school this is the kind of guy Zack and Sid would have shoved into his own locker, but here he is a colleague. Last but not least there is Casey Seeger, the lone woman in the outfit, just a few years after women were even allowed to try for this career at all.Lou Gossett Junior earned his supporting actor academy award as Sgt. Foley . He presses the recruits hard, trying everything to trip them up and expose weaknesses in their character. It's too bad it really didn't seem to do much for his career.Look out for a young David Caruso whose trip into the drink in a simulator pretty much paralleled his acting career. See NYPD Blue, season one, for reference.A great double bill would be this film and ""Easy Rider"" made just 13 years before. How drastically the culture had changed in thirteen years. No one connected with ""Easy Rider"" wanted to be a gentleman, let alone an officer. If ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" had been shown in 1969 or the early 70s, those who flocked to ""Easy Rider"" would have scorned its theme of salvation through military service the way they scorned ""The Green Berets."" Think of the contrasts between the two films, especially since Richard Gere and Lou Gossett, Jr. would have been perfectly capable of playing counter cultural heroes. Pessimism vs. optimism. Hatred of the system vs. a belief that the system works.At any rate, the rather bad lesson this teaches young working class women is made up for by the all star cast - an ensemble of actors that works and an overall great script. Plus it is just a wonderful representative of those early 80s. I'd highly recommend it.",An Officer and a Gentleman
16,AaronCapenBanner,He Will Be Both.,7,23 September 2013,"Richard Gere plays Zack Mayo, a prospective Navy Officer training cadet who must decide to gain control over his direction-less life, helped by a no-nonsense Gunnery sergeant(superbly played by Louis Gossett Jr., who won an Academy Award) who berates Zack, but all in the effort of making him into a successful Naval officer. Debra Winger plays his girlfriend, who is also struggling with her own life. They both have friends(played by David Keith and Lisa Blount) whose relationship mirrors their own, only with far different results.Entertaining and old-fashioned(in some ways!) film is well acted by its stars, and has stylish direction by Taylor Hackford. Story is surprisingly involving(if a bit predictable) and builds to a satisfying conclusion with the winning song ""Up Where We Belong"".A big hit that made its leads stars.",An Officer and a Gentleman
17,Aaron1375,One of those chick flicks that throws in some training to try and divert the males from this fact.,6,23 October 2010,"This film was okay, one of the only Richard Gere movies I have seen. Not really my kind of movie for the most part, but it held my interest when they were doing the training. Do not get me wrong, training takes up a huge portion of this film, but at its heart it is still more of a romance in my eyes. The story basically focuses on these two guys trying to get through this very hard training course so that they may become officers in the military. Their sergeant is going to try and make them quit, as that is his job to weed out those that are really not up to the task. That is one of the reasons I take issue with the movie, I thought the sergeant did nothing wrong in talking David Keith's character out of the program. That is what he was supposed to do, Gere's character's anger is rather misplaced as I would have blamed the female as she was clearly nothing more than an opportunist who cared nothing for the man himself and only felt bad after he did what he did near the end. In the end it is a bit of a messed up romance movie as the love these girls show for these men is simply more of a need to get out of the small town they lived in and make something better for themselves so a kind of self serving love to be sure. Still, some of the training stuff was enjoyable to watch.",An Officer and a Gentleman
18,Wuchakk,The best of its kind,9,21 January 2014,"Released in 1982, ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" was the obvious inspiration of films like Tom Cruise's ""Top Gun"" and ""Days of Thunder."" ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" was the first and best, by far.The plot similarities are obvious: They all include the angry young man who needs to prove his gifting, the uncompromising mentor, the encouraging babe, the craft, the arena and the doomed buddy. In ""An Officer"" the angry young man is Richard Gere as Mayo, the mentor is Louis Gossett Jr. as Drill Instructor Folely, the babe is Paula (Debra Winger), the craft is aviation basic training, the arena is a Naval academy and the Puget Sound area of Washington (shot on location) and the buddy is Sid Worley (David Keith).Thankfully, the film doesn't get bogged down telling the back-story of Mayo. Instead, it ingeniously shares his past in a matter of minutes at the very beginning. It's all we need to know to understand why Mayo is the way he is. And then we're off to basic training where he's tested. Does he have what it takes? Can someone as lowborn, aloof and un-trusting as Mayo make it as an officer?Debra Winger and Lisa Blount shine here as Mayo and Worley's babes. Winger is alluring in a humble ""girl next door"" type of way (she out-shined Lynda Carter as Wonder Girl on ""Wonder Woman,"" which is hard to believe), but Blount is even more alluring -- yes, despite the negative aspects of her character. I'll just put it this way, she really fills out a pair of jeans, lol. Both couples get intimate way too quickly, but maybe this is one of the flaws of the ""Puget Debs"" and explains why they have a problems getting marriage material, if you know what I mean. Besides this, time has to be condensed in a two-hour film.BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a film of this ilk ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" is the best of the lot.GRADE: AINSIGHTS ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further unless you've seen the film):An officer is a military leader. Drill Instructor Foley's job is to weed out those who can't hack it as an officer. It's an important job because people's lives in combat are dependent on the quality of the leaders and Foley takes his job seriously.Foley rightly pegs Mayo as a lowlife loner from the outset -- a wannabe officer -- and therefore puts on the pressure. This is especially so on the one weekend where he has Mayo to himself. Foley does everything he can to make Mayo break AND quit, but Mayo doesn't. He breaks, indeed, but he refuses to quit on the grounds that he has no where to go. At the end of this scene you can see that Foley develops respect for Mayo (which you get a glimpse of earlier when Mayo does extremely well on the obstacle course).Later, Mayo disregards breaking the record on the obstacle course (which he was definitely able to do) in order to encourage Seegar (the female recruit) to finally make it over the wall. Foley sees that Mayo's no longer the aloof and selfish loner he was when he rode in on his motorcycle. He's matured; he's developed character. It was already there, of course, but the boot camp training has brought it to the fore, and Foley sees it.After Worley's tragic death, Mayo confronts Foley while he's drilling the platoon. Foley informs Mayo that they all know what happened and even tells him they're sorry about Worley. He didn't have to do this and it shows that Foley isn't just an honorable man, but also that he cared about Worley. After all, Worley was only one week away from graduating! In a sense, he was one of Foley's kids. In other words, Foley and the platoon were grieving too. But Mayo was closest to Worley and he's crazy with shock & grief at this point. He insists that he's going to quit, to which Foley tells him to meet him for a fight. Sure, there's some testosterone in his words, but he actually does this out of respect for Mayo as a last ditch effort to keep him from dropping out.And Foley doesn't ""kick his axx"", as some claim. It was essentially an even match and Foley barely walks off the mat, which is the only reason he technically wins. But that's inconsequential. The purpose of the fight was to run Mayo's steam out so he didn't make a rash decision in an obvious moment of grief & anger. Foley accomplished his purpose. Once Mayo was no longer blinded by rage he makes the right choice and graduates.This is why he thanks Foley at the end.",An Officer and a Gentleman

20,namashi_1,Superb!,7,8 November 2010,"Taylor Hackford's 'An Officer and a Gentleman' is a superb film to watch and enjoy. The brave Screenplay, Excellent performances and memorable Direction make this one a can't miss it flick! 'An Officer and a Gentleman' tells the story of a U.S. Navy aviation officer candidate who comes into conflict with the Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant who trains him. The protagonist, Zack Mayo played by Richard Gere, goes through various emotions. It's a helpful, shrewd and powerful character, that goes through an ark, thus, full filling it's motivations.Douglas Day Stewart's Screenplay is fantastic. He gives his Hero a lot to do, and that only goes to prove it's potential. Taylor Hackford's Direction is memorable. Cinematography by Donald E. Thorin, is apt. Editing is worth a mention.Performance-Wise: Richard Gere is amazing in the lead role. Zack Mayo becomes Gere after a point. This is the veteran's best performance. Debra Winger is another topper. She delivers a dramatic performance from start to end. Louis Gossett, Jr. as the Sergeant, is good. David Keith does very well. Lisa Blount is very sincere. Others do their bits well.On the whole, This Superb Piece Of Cinema Is A Must Watch! Recommended!",An Officer and a Gentleman
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A little over acted at times, but over all it was done just right",8,12 August 2006,"An officer and a gentleman is over all a pretty legendary movie, especially the ending. And I have to admit that it was a good one. But I think the true reason I liked this movie was the bootcamp sequence, it was very realistic and heart wrenching. Especially for Richard Gere's friend and how his heart got broken by that heartless woman. Sorry, still getting over that scene.I have to say, for two actors who hated each other in real life, Richard Gere and Debra Winger, they had some steamy chemistry. There was some pretty steamy sex scenes. Louis Gotting, Jr. was amazing, I'm sorry, I know the spelling is wrong, but he deserved his Oscar. So, over all I have to say this movie was pretty good and I would recommend it for an afternoon.8/10",An Officer and a Gentleman
22,blanbrn,"Uplifting. A movie full of emotions, sadness, and growth of the underdog spirit. All ending in love and romance.",8,27 May 2007,"What can I say about 1982's ""Officer and a Gentleman"" clearly one of the better movies of the 80's and in my opinion the best film of 1982. This movie can show a viewer so many sides and emotional elements like romance, friendship, and growth. Set in Seattle, Washington at the naval training school at Port Townsend enter Zack Mayo(Richard Gere) who's a life long loner and loser finally decides he has dreams of becoming a pilot. Zack wants to escape years of abuse, neglect, and lonely times, but first he must endure 13 weeks weeks of tough and torturous training. Zack will learn plenty along the way, most of all he learns character, discipline, and heart from a brilliant and iron fisted drill instructor by the name of Sgt. Foley(Louis Gossett Jr.) and in my opinion Gossett gives one of the finest supporting roles performance in film history as evidenced by his Oscar win for best supporting actor. Friendships and love are developed along the way when Zack falls in love with local girl Paula(Debra Winger) who's found her knight to take her away. And David Keith gives a very memorable performance as Zack's best friend and fellow candidate. It' so sad when the Keith character lets current social issues and past insecurities send him to a tragic end, believe me you will want to shed tears. Overall the performances are great from Gere, Winger, Keith, and most of all Gossett Jr. who carries the film with his noteworthy performance. This film is rich and very satisfying and really timeless because of it's elements of growth, and a fairy tale ending of love, and it proves an underdog can accomplish anything just by learning the important trait of discipline. A real winner and ranks as the top picture of 1982.",An Officer and a Gentleman
23,lasttimeisaw,Oscar-calibre crowd-pleaser with a flawed message to deliver,6,26 May 2016,"The movie was a box office sensation in 1982 (a domestic grossing around $129 million against its $6 million budget) and catapults Richard Gere and Debra Winger onto leading material phenoms among their peers, and won Louis Gossett Jr. an Oscar for portraying the rigorous drill sergeant Foley.Directed by Taylor Hackford (Mr. Helen Mirren if it rings a bell to those unfamiliar with his works), it is only his second feature film, about a young man Zack (Gere), decides to join the US Navy to fly jets, so he must survive the 13-week training at Aviation Officer Candidate School with his fellow candidates, under the harsh supervision of Foley. Meantime he engages in a romantic relationship with a local girl Paula (Winger) in spite of the warnings that some girls are determined with their own agenda, they will do everything to trick a promising future aviator into marriage, is Paula one of them?Confining the story within these 13 weeks, the film makes sure that we have no chance glimpsing some expensive action set pieces of naval aviation like in Tony Scott's TOP GUN (1986), contentedly, it buoys up the narrative with a feel-good camaraderie bonding during the training program among the cadets, Zack befriends with Sid Worley (Keith), a patriotic young man from a good family, who enrols to assume the lofty vocation of his late brother (a navy officer died in the Vietnam war). To ensure its political correctness, apart from a black trainer, the assembly includes a black family guy Perryman (Sylvester), a homunculus latino Della Serra (Plana), even a female candidate Casey Seeger (Eilbacher), the only missing addition is an Asian.Dazzled by its faithful imitation of the training process, including a novel Dilbert Dunker sequence which disqualifies a very young David Caruso, nevertheless, audience will find out that the centre piece in the school resides within the dynamic relation between a self-assertive Zack and the despotic Foley, Louis Gossett Jr. enforces a bombastic gambit to the utter perfection during his first scenes, and establishes his prestige in spectators both in and off screen. The character Foley precedes a more sadistic variation, R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Harman in Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET (1987), and Mr. Ermey is in fact the acting coach for Mr. Gossett here; also it is an archetype of the love-and-hate mentor type, which has been portrayed with much more ambiguity and menace in another Oscar-winning performance, J.K. Simmons in Damien Chazelle's WHIPLASH (2014).On the romantic side, there are very erotic sex scenes between Zack and Paula, explicit and intimate, both Gere and Winger are no holds barred in their on screen commitment, especially Winger, ""How can you resist? I'm like candy!"", gives a sensual, sympathetic and more organic performance in this borderline leading role (which earns her first Oscar nomination). Gere is smoking hot whether he is disrobed or suited with navy uniform, and a brief flashback of the past before the opening credits may suggest Zack's disturbed inner state, but as the story unwinds, he turns out quite well, an Alpha male imparted with street smart, only a bit little withheld, and don't make promises easily.But, tragedy lurks not far away, if Paula bespeaks a good-hearted girl who dares to love somebody unconditionally, the flip side is Sid's squeeze Lynette (Blount), who indirectly triggers a very unsound twist of melodrama only to drive Zack become more cynical and in turn, leave its patronising ending more uplifting when its Oscar-winning theme song UP WHERE WE BELONG swells as if Paula were the damsel in distress whose drab life could only be rescued by a handsome navy officer, that's the biggest mistake of this otherwise agreeable picture, Paula is a wholesome package (although the moment when she reveals the identity of her biological father, it is a rather cunning move to manipulate sense of guilty to advantage), it is Zack who is in the receiving end of a helping hand.",An Officer and a Gentleman
24,ElMaruecan82,The Clothes Do Not Make The Man... or do they?,9,4 October 2018,"It is strange how clothing, and its counterpart ""nudity"", occupy a special place in Taylor Hackford's ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". And I don't think it is gratuitous. Without getting over-analytical, my impression is that the film attaches a very subtle importance to looks and clothes, it's not trivial material but the kind of things lesser movies would have trivialized.The first time we see Zack Mayo, he looks like Richard Gere coming back from his ""American Gigolo"" star-making role or getting ready for an audition for ""The Outsiders"". Yet, what really catches the eye and not quite pleasantly is the naked body of his father lying in bed with a prostitute. It's only in the following yellow-toned flashback that we realize he's a Navy officer. What we've got then is a contrast between a uniform and an attitude. Indeed, the father (Robert Loggia) feels no grief about the suicide of his wife and has no qualms about making his son grow up in the vicinity of every brothel in the naval bases they are sent to. His nudity represents his true nature, a selfish, careless and honor-less man. Better than anyone else, Zack knows it takes more than a uniform to be an officer, but the uniform is part of it, so he reports to the Aviation Officers School for a 13-week training where he meets other promising newcomers, among them Sid Worley, a friendly rich Okie played by David Keith. The movie shows the two men becoming friends and following what seems to be the same path: they learn at the expenses the harshness of their drill sergeant Foley (Louis Gossett Jr.), they enjoy their first perms, and they fall in love with two young factory workers who are, according to Foley, are what they call Puget Sound Debs (as for debutantes): sort of gold-diggers whose only motives is to marry an aviator and enjoy the great life overseas and all the benefits.The two paths are similar only in the surface, in reality they highlight the tremendous gaps that can exist between people who act in pretension and those who act responsibly. Zack is with Paula (Debra Winger) and Sid with her friend Lynette (Lisa Blount). Lynette makes no secret that her dream is to marry an aviator and she'd go as far as trapping a man through pregnancy for that, she worships the ""uniform"" just like the guys from the town despise it for stealing their thunder in a bar. Sid isn't that superficial, he's the nicest person and is quite competent but is a spineless man leading an aimless life: once he learned that Lynette was pregnant, he dropped on request (DOR) and proposed her, wearing civilian suits. Naturally, she couldn't say yes and berated him for having abandoned so close to the graduation, and crushed their dreams, but at that time, she crushed his soul and later he was found hanged in the bathroom, naked in the truth of his own failure.Interestingly, nakedness has more positive undertones when it comes to Zach and Paula, and the two parallel stories emphasize how good and made one for another both Zach and Paula are, at least because they tend toward sincerity and question their feelings, is Paula looking for a real love or a substitute to the AOC father who abandoned her before being commissioned? Is Zach suspecting Paula to be one of these 'Dabs'? The man's scared of that very relationship and the way in intertwines with his own training. In one pivotal scene, he treats Paula so harshly she tells him it's not the attitude of an officer, hitting a sensitive chord and prompting him to apologize. He knew at that point he behaved like his father: uniform and no attitude. Later when forced to DOR under Foley's pressure and threatened to be expelled, he finally breaks down and shouts: ""I got nowhere else to go!"" that moment didn't earn Foley's respect but understanding that maybe the cocky brat came to self-realization.At that point of the review, I should mention LouisGossett Jr.' performance as Foley and say it's as worthy of the Oscar as R. Lee Ermey deserved a nomination for ""Full Metal Jacket"", but I retrospectively appreciate the way Foley is never an antagonist but a driver and if he doesn't show any softness, it's because he likes his AOC enough to give them his best shot. The subplot involving the female candidate Seeger (Lisa Eilbacher) could have made a great movie itself and it allows us to show that it's not a matter of ambition but of character and heart. That's exactly what lacked in the ill-fated Sid, unlike Lynette, he had the right attitude but not the heart it takes to wear the uniform or any 'uniform' for that matter. And what the film's journey shows is people learning over the course of thirteen weeks the things that define them: those they can't quit.Which of course takes us to that magnificent ending, copied and parodied so many times I was glad that for once, I saw the original before all the parodies (whether ""The Simpsons"", ""Friends"" and many more). It's a Cinderella-ending all right but beyond all the cinematic archetypes and the catchy Joe Cocker's ""Up Where We Belong"" theme, we have two decent persons realizing they belong to each other and can finally make their lives converge. So the dashing white prince took her away under people's cheers and applauses and for all its blue-collar realism, the one detail that consecrates that symbiosis, right before the image freezes, is Paula putting Zack's cap on her head, like a last clothing detail that speaks a thousand words.It's one of the most emotionally satisfying ending because the movie made us care for the characters before embracing their happiness, it had the ""uniform"" of a romance but the attitude of a character study... and study of character!",An Officer and a Gentleman

Others were also above very good, they are great. Overall, this movie is not a ""cheezee"" romance, it is a very accurate portrait of romance, which shows that both have to work to build up a relationship.

Here is a perfect example of such romanticism, in a modern environment, that of a navy academy somewhere in the US. Romanticism, drama as well as happy ending, one casualty and one total epiphany. What's more you add to that the bad character of the salvaged hero at the beginning and his complete transformation into a good man, a good heart and a fair mind that will not play around and will finally do what his conscience tells him to do and his hormones force him to fall into.

As we don't pay our duty in military in my family in the last 3 generations (myself, I was exempted because of my hearing), it's interesting to see the barrack life. I would like to take the drill once to see if I can do it.Beyond this, as the movie was shot in locations in the Pacific Northwest, it has the feel of ""Twin Peaks"" a decade before. I recognize that the cast is good and I realize that Debra (along with Darryl) was the actress of the 80's.

32,jadavix,Better than I expected,7,26 March 2019,"For most of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"", what was on screen felt fairly familiar. It's a story of a young man going through military training, so of course we get the diabolical drill sergeant, scenes of rope climbing and obstacle courses, unlikely friendship between mismatched bunkmates, moments where the hero thinks about quitting, only to change his mind...The movie does have a couple of things that stand out about it, though, and to my mind make it worth watching. For one, the great actress, Debra Winger, plays the love interest, and she's one of those actresses you just can't imagine hitting a false note, or turning in a clichéd portrayal. She just feels really authentic.Another unexpected step was the character arc provided for David Keith, the best friend of the protagonist. His story goes somewhere I was not expecting.R. Lee Ermey/Sergeant Hartman is probably always going to be the definitive drill sergeant, but I still warmed to Lou Gosset Jr. in the role, though the movie didn't make that easy.",An Officer and a Gentleman
33,ianlouisiana,"The repression of individuallity is a ""Good Thing"" - Discuss.......",6,18 February 2008,"Calling ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" the best film Mr Richard Gere has ever appeared in may seem like damning it with faint praise.However,it is a personal triumph for him as the arrogant - seeming Naval officer - cadet with a chip the size of the U.S.S. ""Missouri"" on his shoulder. Son of a roistering sailor who makes ""Popeye"" seem like Tiny Tim,Zack Mayo - in desperation seeking a family - type environment - enlists in the U.S.Navy O.C.S..Toughened on the streets of Navy Towns all over the world he possesses fitness and bloody - minded determination but little else.The Navy's task is to maintain his two attributes but teach him others that might seem antithetical,teamwork,compassion and awareness of others. Tney've been making movies about these kind of things since that rather strange Mr Griffith first pointed a camera and shouted ""action"". The tough D.I. who you just know will end up respecting the squad maverick,the feisty gal you go to jeer but stay to cheer,the screw - up whose life the maverick will save,the best friend who will die so that the maverick can redeem himself,the way the squad gradually becomes a team and grows to love the gruff D.I...................yes it's all the stuff of a hundred clichéd films from West Point to Catterick. Mr Gere and Mr Gossett(along with Mr Jack Webb the best D.I. on film, Mr F.Lee Ermey being ever - so - slightly a fictional creation of the anti - military Mr Stanley Kubrick and Mr Gustav Hasford)dominate the movie.Miss Deborah Winger seems rather unhappy as the factory - girl/Cinderella who finally gets her handsome prince.I found the obligatory sex scenes unconvincing and uncomfortable. Mr Gere however,displays the necessary energy,resentment and sheer grit to convince as the none too pleasant hero. Some may find the rather totalitarian assumption that the repression of individuality is somehow a good thing a little disturbing.But ultimately,Authority is seen as a rather benign paternalism which Mr Gere clearly accepts having rejected that of his own father. Happily,""An officer and a Gentleman"" is more ""Carry on Sergeant"" than ""Full Metal Jacket"" in that it shows the more acceptable side of military training and shows it as being rather like that at a rather posh school,where the former rebel gets the prize for ""Improvement"",i.e. conforming.But,somewhere in Zack Mayo,there is still the spirit that made him the rebel he was.",An Officer and a Gentleman
34,PWNYCNY,Sometimes a guy needs a big brother.,10,15 October 2005,"This movie is about an adolescent who becomes a man with the help of a big brother, who in this case is a hard-nosed, no-nonsense, tough-as-nails drill sergeant. The adolescent is a wayward young man with no direction and with no one to depend on except his alcoholic sailer father who believes that the young man will never succeed at anything. Well, the adolescent wants to prove his father wrong and does something most unexpected - applies for Navy flight school and is accepted. Now the question is: Will he succeed? For him to succeed, this adolescent will have to change: become a team player, take on responsibilities, apply himself to achieving goals, and complete an exceedingly difficult 12-week course that will test not only his physical strength and mental capabilities, but the very essence of his character. In short, the adolescent will have to become a man. And there is only one person who cares enough to push him to succeed - the adolescent's drill sergeant who does everything he can to get the adolescent to drop out, which does not happen. This movie shows what a person can accomplish when they believe in themselves and have a big brother who cares enough to make them succeed. This is a great movie.",An Officer and a Gentleman
35,mjneu59,"textbook Hollywood crowd-pleaser, circa 1982",4,3 November 2010,"One of the big hits of 1982 offers a perfect example of the artfully packaged hokum passing for entertainment in Hollywood at the time. The story supposedly relates the triumph and transfiguration of white trash Richard Gere into the naval aviator of the film's title, following his introduction to the usual hazards of cadet life: punishing training exercises, antagonistic drill sergeants, conniving debutantes, and so forth. Debra Winger is one of the latter, and the uncomplicated blue-collar appeal of her character helps to alleviate the often tortured exposition of the hero's rite of passage. The film's most obvious shortcoming is its unfocused script (which needs to develop a second, parallel love story to throw the first into relief), followed by Richard Gere's total inability to appear sensitive or insecure. The enormous success of the movie can be traced to the marketing skills of its producers, who wisely sold it as a slice of glossy, inspirational junk food.

No normal man behaves like Zack Mayo, but we were taken into the past, to see how damaged he was. Lots of normal women would behave like Paula Pokrifki and Lynette Pomeroy. Gere hit most of the right notes, even though he was playing a man ten years younger than himself. I had forgotten how achingly cute Debra Winger was back then. Wow. And Louis Gossett, Jr. earned his Oscar. He largely made this film. Fortunately, he held that drill sergeant turf long before H. Lee Ermey staked a successful claim for (probably) all time on it.

38,Samiam3,An officer and a gentleman go well together,8,6 February 2010,"Despite a plot which doesn't involve much, An Officer and a Gentleman amounts to a delightful feel good movie, low on clichés and high on performance quality and screen writing (ignoring a few convivances)Zach Mayo is a quiet but angry young man, originating in part from a bad childhood with no connection to family. In the hopes of finding a place in life, he joins the navy, and heads off to a training program. The drill Sergent mentions (among other things) that lots of girls come around the base hoping to marry a pilot. Before long, Zach meets one such girl, and they fall in love fast. As the training progresses, Zachs heart may be put to the test, as to whether he is more committed to his pride and becoming a pilot or if he is ready for the first time to give his life to someone else.Richard Gere in the lead is solid, but he is upstaged by his costars in particular, Lou Gossard Jr. who delivers a near movie stealing performance. An Officer and a gentleman is a nice mix of humour, drama, and romance. it has some small bumps along the way, but it does work. It not just a feel good movie but a feel 'very' good movie.",An Officer and a Gentleman
39,triple8,Vivid characters and story make this a classic.,9,13 December 2003,"I was quite young when I saw this and not into movies this deep, heck I was a kid! Yet this powerful film touched me and I never forgot it.There were so many various relationships going on that between the characters, if the movie had just been about one of those it might have gotten boring but each one of these individuals were so fascinating in their own right, that it never did get dull. Officer isn't a film one can watch at any time, it's so heavy you really have to be in the mood for it. I would definitely call this a classic.I will comment on Debra Winger because as good as everyone was Winger hasn't been commented on as much and should be. Her character Paula was gritty, tough and so likable. She was easily as good as anyone else in the movie(I miss not seeing her in current movies, she's amazing).This isn't my absolute favorite film but its one of the most well done films I've ever seen.",An Officer and a Gentleman
40,Easygoer10,A pretty good film,8,9 November 2018,"I liked this film. I know there was a lot of animosity (off set) between Debra Winger, Richard Gere and Taylor Hackford. In spite of this, I thought Debra Winger was very good, especially since she was the person who disliked working with the other two. She is one of my favorite American actresses, and not just because if her sexy voice and looks. She is truly gifted in her ability to adapt and cope with difficult situations, and (I believe) this is an admirable quality for an actor who has been maligned unfairly, which she certainly has been. I thought Gere and Lou Gossett were not near as authentic, and Gossett won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I also liked Ms. Winger in Legal Eagles, although it is a bit shallow. Ironically, she really dislikes both films. I hope she wins an Oscar one day, as she deserves it.",An Officer and a Gentleman
41,eric262003,Still Holds Up Strong 33 Years Later,9,5 July 2015,"In the eight years I've been posting reviews on IMDb, I usually like to review the classics over the more recent fare of films, primarily to see if the older movies still ignite flames even to this day forward and partially in my young life I missed a lot of the more adult movies because at one time I had a zero interest in them. Even though ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" came out in 1982, six years after I was born, I only just recently stumbled across it recently (sorry for my tardiness), just because my elders talked so much about it so I just wanted to know what the hype was about and to see if it will leave me with a lasting impression.For those who never seen the film it stars Richard Gere as a young man named Zack Mayo who has recently checked himself into the Navy OCS located in Washington. From the early scenes we discover that Mayo's life was not a very pleasant one. At a very young age, his mother killed herself and was forced to stay with his father (Robert Loggia) while stationed in the Philippines. His father's nurturing was absent since all he had on his mind was drinking and chasing prostitutes. Zach wasn't really prepared for the tough regiments that the OCS had to offer as he struggling in terms of handling commitment let alone following authoritative figures.Mayo is under the tutelage of gunnery Sgt. Emil Foley (Louis Gossett Jr.) and it comes to no surprise that their encountering is just on the horizon. Mayo seems to excel quite well on the physical initiatives that the Navy has to offer, but academically is quite the other story. This leads to Mayo forming a friendship with a fellow classmate named Sid Worley (David Keith) as he will do everything he can to get Mayo into the Aerodynamics class in exchange for immaculate belt- buckles and boots whenever there's a barracks inspection. The main setting for this movie is set in the OCS, there's also a vital subplot that involves Zach, Sid and a couple of girls ""Puget Debs"" who they meet when they're off campus during their weekend. The two ladies are Paula Pokrifki (Debra Winger) and Lynette Pomeroy (Lisa Blount) who a scrounging for military meat in hopes for a quick marriage proposal. These Puget Debs play riskier attempts to get their catch like faking their pregnancies or other things like that. Paula hooks up with Zach while Lynette is onto Sid.The rest of the way it's Zach trying to get through 13 weeks of OCS training and while getting adjusted to Paula. Since Zach is the titular character, fans seem to pretty much know the outcome of the story, but that doesn't deprive itself from being entertaining. After 33 years, I can safely say that ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" has aged quite gracefully. There are a lot of wonderful scenes with many authentic scenes that just can't be beat. Who could forget when Zach confesses to Sgt. Foley ""I got nowhere else to go"", plus the final scene where Mayo is now an ensign finds Paula and walks out with her to the applause of his colleagues. The pacing was also very well structured. Even though the film was almost at the two hour mark, there was never a boring moment and that was because the romantic scenes never interfered with the OCS scenes and it flowed in a more natural way. We also deeply care about the characters and we hope that Zach and Paula stay a couple and hope they live a happy life after the credits roll. Overall this movie gets a 9/10 that's highly recommended, even if you're a late bloomer like me, it's better late than never if you haven't seen this movie. It still holds up today since its release back in 1982.",An Officer and a Gentleman
42,pc95,Quintessential 80s Drama,7,9 August 2013,"One of the stronger movies of the 80s decade, Taylor Hackford's ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" covers a wide gamut of themes and emotions. It takes place in the Navy, and features stories of friendship, romance, and love. Richard Gere does a great job with his emotional acting, but less so with his physical acting as he seems hardly coordinated or athletic enough to convey leading his class. Anyway probably most who have seen this movie will tell you they particularly enjoyed Louis Gossett Jr. Oscar worthy and winning supporting performance as a tough and entertaining Drill Sargent. I would particularly agree, Gossett Jr. is witty and at times sardonic. The friction between characters Gere's Mayo and Gossett Jr Foley seems a little out of place, but still manages to be watchable. The Romanticism and love interest are a little better, with Winger looking stunning and acting more naturally than Gere. The photography and outdoor scenes especially are gorgeously shot. Fairly good soundtrack as well. Give this effort a solid 7.5/10 and recommended.",An Officer and a Gentleman
43,begob,Finding your place,8,18 October 2020,"A wounded loner undergoes tough navy training, only to face tougher choices in comradeship and love ...Coming of age drama that plunges into the troughs and rides the peaks. Actually, it's got nothing to do with waves, but sets itself in a training base for fighter pilots. Although famous for its uplifting finale, it starts out in good, gritty '70s style, with frankness on sex and poverty and profanity. There are several lines about napalm that make no secret of the viciousness and inhumanity of the American military mission, and yet overall it does feel like a Pentagon approved production, with an underlying theme of fitting in to a hierarchy.The two leads are excellent, fully convincing as lovers at first sight. Gere's cry of desperation during his endurance test adds depth to the hero, and there's a really effective two-shot of the lovers in bed, as he opens up to her for the first time. Also an unintentionally funny scene of a passing boat, where the logic of sound and vision means the three mooning characters are shouting through their backsides.Just after the hour mark, the cheese bubbles up in the wall scene on the obstacle course, and I did have to let myself be carried along by the emotional manipulation. Unfair to dismiss the movie as formulaic, because it probably set the formula for several movies to come (especially for Hollywood drill sergeants), but it does tend toward melodrama and just about manages to sustain the tragedy prior to the climax - mostly, I think, because of the ability of the performers. The way women are treated is variable, with a sort of balance sheet of pluses and minuses, coming out as a win for tradition and virtue. Otherwise, the only flaw is that the father's story is unresolved.The editing and pace are good. The famous theme tune seems a bit twangy and staid now, but the soundtrack is quality - perfect choice of Tunnel Of Love for the jukebox scene - and there's some fun in the first dance scene with the band and its squawky sax.Overall: Holds up well, and bonus point for Tunnel Of Love.",An Officer and a Gentleman

46,classicalsteve,How an Italian-American Loner Transcends at the Hands of a Tough Sergeant,10,22 November 2015,"When I first saw this film, being too young and naïve to understand it, I thought the sergeant was a complete jerk, being needlessly rough and even unfair towards his new recruits. Upon several viewings, I finally understood the sergeant's true intentions. He's not being mean for the sake of causing unhappiness. He's pushing his recruits outside their comfort zones to see who they really are for the purposes of revealing their strengths and weaknesses. Even during his opening speech, Sergeant Foley (Louis Gossett, Jr, in an academy-award winning role), he tells them he will use methods fair and unfair to expose their weaknesses, and he expects more than half of them to D.O.R., military abbreviation for ""drop on request"".Zack Mayo (Richard Gere in his first acclaimed starring role), an Italian-American in the lower middle-class, has joined the Navy. He wants to become a naval pilot, but he must first endure and persevere through a basic-training program at the hands of one of the toughest sergeants in the Navy before the military will allow him to sit in the pilot's seat of a plane. When the new cadet-trainees line up before Sergeant Foley, he tells them that even before they can start learning how to fly planes, they must prove to him they are of the right material for the job. He scolds them for listening to too much ""Mick Jaggar music"" and defaming their country. He then engages them on a rigorous training program which makes other military programs seem like Romper Room by comparison. However, we notice something about Zack from the get-go: he's a loner. While the other recruits immediately bond and try to pull for one-another to survive the training, Zack is often on the side, alone. He does befriend one other trainee, Sid Worley (David Keith), a young southerner who has family ties to the military.Foley warns the cadets about the local women looking for officer-pilots to date and possibly marry, but Zach and Sid take no heed and instead go out during evenings to meet women in the local town. Zach finds Paula (Debra Winger in an equally compelling performance), a working girl at a paper factory, and they immediately embark on a relationship. However, Paula is uncertain whether Zach truly loves her or whether he's just using her as temporary companionship and sexual release while he's enduring the trainee torture at the hands of Foley. Sid also meets a woman, Lynette, who desires to marry a pilot. When he is invited to have dinner with Paula's family, Zach learns Paula has had a habit of dating potential pilots, and her father was one such pilot-cadet in the same program. Paula was born out of wedlock.However, Zach has a little secret. He's been trading in a black market of military accoutrements, hiding his inventory above one of the ceiling panels in his dormitory room. He buys them in bulk wholesale from another soldier from a different company who has extra items on hand, and then resells them to his fellows at a profit. Usually the customer-soldier comes to Zach's ""store"" when he needs something which looks shiny and new for inspection. Often, if a cadet doesn't pass inspection he or she may lose their time off, so Zach always has customers willing to buy. Then one day, when an African-American recruit is desperate for an item to pass inspection, Sergeant Foley arrives in the room and says ""In every class, there's always one joker who thinks that he's smarter than me."" This is just simply a fine story from beginning to end with a top-notch cast. Gere offers his first challenging performance in which he rises to the occasion, one of many to come during the course of his career. In particular, Louis Gossett almost steals the show as the tough but fair-minded sergeant who desires only the best soldiers for the pilot training program. Apparently, his part was written with a white sergeant in mind, but Gossett makes every piece of dialogue his own, and as far as I know the part was little changed when Gossett was cast. Honorable mention also to Debra Winger as Zach's love interest. An amazing story of growth and transcendence.",An Officer and a Gentleman

Well I tell you something I would pay double to see John Denver have a crew-cut and take on a black drill sergeant in hand-to-hand combat. Sounds just like his sort of thing - instead of getting angry he could write a right-on country song about it!There is nothing wrong with Richard Gere as an actor (when trying!) and there is nothing wrong with Debra Winger as an actress. Indeed Winger is actually a very good actress and it a shame that Hollywood prefers people that want to throw their sexuality at you. Sadly she is playing someone that works in a factory and therefore doesn't know - straight away -  that America doesn't have a base in ""Mos-cow""!America doesn't recruit officers from the hard-of-thinking - they have to leaders of men. What we have in this group are followers and not leaders. Besides from his (Gere's) background he should know what was involved: Breaking people down to build them back up again.

As is often the case in these military/romance pictures, I found the weakest part of the film to be the romantic side.  The romance seemed to do little more than fatten up a thin, formulaic plot, and I would have preferred more scenes with Keith or Gossett.

The relationship between the main character and his father, his best friend, his drill sergeant and his girlfriend.The story was average. I was hoping it would be a bit more action, but it was just a steady film. Not a lot happened. There were a few moments that made me laugh a bit and a couple of moments that were harsh. I thought Richards character went through a rough time.The film stars Richard Gere, Debra Winger, David Keith, Robert Loggia, Lisa Blount & Louis Gossett Jr.The acting was quite good.

The actors move thru the film, reciting their lines as though the first time they've seen them were on the cue cards.

56,roghache,Classic military love story: an officer and a genuine lady,8,11 March 2006,"Perhaps not brilliant, but this justifiably popular military romance should be memorable if, for no other reason, than its wonderful inspiring Academy Award winning song, ""Up Where We Belong"".The movie tells the tale of Zack Mayo, an officer candidate at a Navy flight school training aviators. It chronicles his story, mainly through his interactions with his drill sergeant (Sgt. Foley), his buddy (Seeger), and especially his love interest, a local girl named Paula. The factory girls from the small nearby town have set their caps on bagging (sometimes even entrapping, if necessary) husbands from among the class of future officers, in order to improve their social / financial situation. Needless to say, the would be officers, by contrast, are generally seeking one night stands with said girls.Really, the film revolves around Zack and his character development. Certainly as the movie begins, while he may indeed be an officer candidate, clearly he is no gentleman. While not totally despicable, the arrogant candidate isn't a particularly sympathetic character either, perhaps due in part to his troubled family history. His mother committed suicide when he was young and his father, also a military man, essentially ignored him. Thus Zack is training to become a Navy pilot in order to give his life some direction. Richard Gere is utterly is convincing in the role; I cannot imagine any other actor playing it.Louis Gossett Jr. is brilliant as the hard nosed, tough as nails, no nonsense drill sergeant, Foley, who must try to make an officer out of this candidate who, in his opinion, is clearly lacking. There are some dramatic, moving, and emotional scenes between him and Zack. Gossett deserved his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.I personally really liked Zack's buddy, Casey Seeger, and found his military story and his romance with another factory girl an interesting plot line, especially for comparison with Zack and Paula.However, all that being said, for me this movie is made by the lovely Debra Winger. She brings a real integrity and vulnerability to the role of the working class Paula, a girl with few opportunities and prospects, head over heels in love with a man she knows will almost certainly break her heart. My respect for this marvelous actress went up a further notch when I read from several other commentators that she did not want to do the nude love scene and that the tears falling down her face during this scene were in fact tears of humiliation and not acting for the role. I don't know much of the military and this picture may not be accurate (probably isn't!), but I found it an interesting glimpse into cadet life, training, expectations, and so on.As for the ending, I won't give it away here but it's one of the legends of the cinematic world. A great movie for members of both sexes. As another reviewer cleverly phrased it, grab the popcorn and enjoy.",An Officer and a Gentleman

59,flingebunt,A sane look into the mouth of madness,7,15 May 2005,"Military training films all possess many of the same issues. War is one of the most insane acts of humanity, and military training is the process of preparing people for this insanity and in the process perhaps making them insane too.Most military training films have a pay off at the end where the soldiers do indeed go into battle.An officer and a gentleman is a different. Zack Mayo grew up with his Navy father in various naval bases around the world. Hardly believing it himself he decides to enroll at the Naval academy in preparation to becoming a Naval officer (and Navy pilot).So his personal journey begins. He knows every conceivable trick of the Navy and does his best to exploit it. He is tough, already able to pass most of the physical tests the Navy will throw at him.But being a leader of men is more than that, and so he is put to the test by a drill Sargent who is determined to either break him or make an officer and a gentleman of him.Not my favourite military training film (my favourite being Heartbreak ridge, with Futal Metal Jacket being an interesting expose of the madness). However An Officer and Gentleman is a movie that I greatly respect for it's intelligence and insight.",An Officer and a Gentleman
60,The_Core,Excellent,8,30 March 2005,"This movie (in part) inspired me to enlist in the Navy Reserves back in 1983. It was certainly brought up in boot camp, and everyone who'd seen it agreed it was excellent.I recently saw the film again after a long time (five years at least) and it's amazing how fresh it still is. It really doesn't have the ""80's feel"" that a lot of other movies made around that time. It does sadden me to note that there were many more Naval bases then, before the Clinton-era closures.All in all, a rather timeless classic with themes that aren't limited to the military and that all of us can relate to in one way or another. Highly recommended rental, at least... if you like it, buy the DVD, because this is one film with a high re-watchability factor.",An Officer and a Gentleman
61,fimimix,..Fair to middling..,8,10 August 2006,"I read all of the comments presented here BEFORE I watched the movie - I had seen it many years ago. I suppose I must have liked it much better then than I did this time. With most of the ""users'"" comments raging it was the best they'd ever seen, I really expected to be wowed. I hate to say it, but I wasn't. I tried to listen to the part of the DVD where the director (Taylor Hackford) was doing his spiel, but I couldn't get into it - I really didn't care, because he wasn't telling too much how difficult the scenes were to film or adding interesting comments, just his total relief that the film ever got to the screen - even the producer wanted to take his name off it.Of course, ""An Officer and a Gentlemen"" is a a hit again, because it is now being seen by a younger crowd - pretty-much the first time they've seen this type of movie. I respect their opinions, but my opinion is this is not a romantic movie for really mature people. As an older film, people who are watching it for the first time, it is a different Richerd Gere (Mayo) they are seeing. Some even mention ""Primal Fear"", which - to me - IS really a movie for all ages, but terribly frightening, in that it shows how adults can become obsessed with younger, beautiful people. I thought the sex scenes scorched the screen - very true-to-life. Not too many people would want that side of the personality made public.Debra Winger (Paula) WAS beautiful and played her role skillfully. I also got caught-up with the touching ending, the music certainly making it right. I was onto Lisa Blount (Lynette) from git-go - she advertised it. David Keith was such a fresh face in this film, and his character certainly was the ""all-American"" guy (wonder if they make them like that any more?), intelligent enough to realize he wasn't into military life. He became like Mayo as a child - betrayed without the macho strength to make it without his love. I thought Douglas Stewart got all the aspects of the ""13 weeks"" in his script, but I think it was just a tad too clean and attractive. Richard Gere was right for the role - Travolta ??? Yeah, Louis Gossett Jr did a good job in the film, and I do not begrudge him his Oscar. What DID become of him? Almost all of the other cast-members went on to future movies, Gere certainly proving he wasn't just a handsome man. All of the male cast were so healthy and virile, what else could they do but succeed? I'm glad younger people have a movie they can relate to, BUT: There wasn't enough intrigue in this film to really make it a ""classic love-story"". Enjoyable, indeed. However, enduring love is seen in movies like ""Sophie's Choice"" in which everyone had so much baggage; even ""Stingo"" was so virgin, he was just as bad as the stinkers. I can watch ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" again, but it would be for a change of pace, or to make certain I was paying attention, this time. BTW, I missed the sex-scene when tears were supposed to be rolling down Winger's face because she hated Gere - she always looked like she was having a good time, to me.I think if they hadn't had the problem with the military officials hating this script and refusing to cooperate in any way and it had been made in Pensacola (Fla.), it would have been much grittier - Pensacola has always been a swinging town.For light entertainment, I recommend this film to all - if you're looking for a truly steamy love-story, this ain't it. Enjoy -",An Officer and a Gentleman
62,destinylives52,Great Movie For Romance/Drama Fans,8,24 June 2017,"A mega-hit from the early 1980s, ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" is a story of a young hustler, played by Richard Gere, who enters the U.S. Navy's Officer Candidate School and gets a lot more than what he bargained for.Fresh out of college and carrying a ton of emotional baggage, Gere is off to a rough start in OCS with his loner personality, money making schemes, and defiant nature. Although he cruises easily through the physical parts of his training, there are still many things that can trip him up: a tough, ever vigilant Drill Instructor (played by Louis Gossett, Jr.); a factory worker (played by Debra Winger) who falls in love with Gere; and a fellow candidate –who is carrying his own set of destructive, emotional problems — who befriends Gere. OCS isn't just a test to see if Gere has what it takes to be a Naval pilot, it is also a journey to see if he can open himself to accept life's most precious gift.My most memorable, movie moment of ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" is the scene when Gere and Gossett take their differences to the extreme and engage in a brutal, karate fight.People looking for accurate, basic training of soldiers will find many faults in this movie; but ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" is not a documentary on the U.S. Navy. It is a story of romance and emotional growth, and it hits all the right emotions and sentiments for those who love this genre.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",An Officer and a Gentleman
63,robb_772,Realistic presentation of old-school romance,8,4 May 2006,"Though ribbed by some critics for being a crude update of the formula film romances of the 1940's, audiences still showed up in droves to see this film and turned it into one of the biggest grossers of 1982. While the film may certainly follow the general formulaic outlines of the genre, director Taylor Hackford and screenwriter Douglas Day Stewart dodge sentimentalization with a healthy dosage of grim reality. This is no longer the ultra-glamorized world of old Hollywood; AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN is a movie about love in the real world. By not sheltering it's lovers from the harsh nature of humanity, the film manages to have a significantly greater impact as it works toward a deservedly optimistic ending.In a role turned down by both John Travolta and John Denver, Richard Gere lends a brooding intensity that electrifies what could have been a bland protagonist. Debra Winger, with her down-home sexiness at it's peak, turns in a fascinating portrayal of small town frustration, and Louis Gossett Jr nearly steals the picture in a harrowing, Oscar-winning performance. In fact, Gere's relationship with Gossett's Drill Sargent is just as involving as his love affair with Winger. The supporting cast is also well-cast, with David Keith, Robert Loggia, and Lisa Blount delivering standout performances.",An Officer and a Gentleman

65,ray-280,As bad as I'd always imagined....and then some,1,21 October 2007,"Some gifts keep on giving...like rotting fish. To that extent, this film, perhaps the worst ever to win an Oscar, gives even to this day. Ever since the overplayed theme song (""up where we belong"") demolished the airwaves in the summer of 1982, I have always imagined this film as sappy, lousy, a total ""chick flick"" and with a terribly unrealistic portrayal of our military. As it turned out, even those low expectations were not met, as this film is far worse. In fact, if you were to set out to make a bad movie, with a bad cast, bad cinematography, and a bad theme song, you'd be hard-pressed to ""top"" this.No one factor makes this film bad, as you could remove any one item from the film and it would still stink. Zach Mayo (Richard Gere) isn't inspiring as a lead, nor is Gere, but Deborah Winger takes bad to a new level in this film as the extremely uninspiring, social-climbing girlfriend (who puts down a fellow social climber for doing the same thing). A few years ago Winger lamented on there not being roles for older female actresses, but perhaps those who were avoiding her merely saw her crapper of a performance in this film.As is this were bad enough, we wind up stuck with Lou Gossett Jr. as an academy award winner for his phoned-in performance as the stereotypical drill instructor, a movie with no real plot that is driven by poor characters, and total pandering to the female side of the audience that drives the box office.While not surprising that the movie was a hit, that doesn't improve its quality. Simpleminded moviegoers will love it, while those with an acquired taste for quality film will see right through it.A must-miss, but if you are curious, check out this film for its train-wreck appeal.",An Officer and a Gentleman
66,nzswanny,"You know, I wasn't expecting it to be the masterpiece it was.",10,27 June 2017,"Once upon a time in the early 80's, a film directed by Taylor Hackford was released called An Officer and A Gentleman. Many enjoyed it, and since it's release it has remained a classic and has gained fans over the years. I was looking forward to this film, however despite how much I wanted to see it, my expectations were still blown away.First off, the editing in this film is brilliant. I won't spoil another scenes, but The opening scene when Zach Mayo flashbacks to his past was absolutely brilliant. That one scene is criminally underrated, and as I watched the opening scene, I knew I was in for a really good movie. The way the takes fold together feels all like one take, it's superb. I had to go look up who the editor for this movie was, and, no surprises, it's the same pal who edited The Godfather! No wonder the editing was good...The cinematography was also very good, but in order to keep this review short so to not occupy your time, I think the film remains realistic as it develops an emotional story that remains handled well under the careful hands of the director. This film is not another simple romantic movie, it's an emotional look at the life of being an aviator, the hardships and humour and grief of it all without being overly sentimental or melodramatic. The pacing, editing, cinematography and story all combine into an absolute masterpiece and it's safe to say that you won't be wasting any of your time watching this. Respect goes to Taylor Hackford for making this masterpiece. Go watch it.",An Officer and a Gentleman
67,justbob1982,Full Metal Jacket meets Pretty Woman,7,17 January 2014,"Version I saw: UK Bluray releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 5/10Overall: 7/10The final scene of this film has been referenced a billion times, and goes down as one of the most cheesy you have ever seen. Just the sound of 'Up Where We Belong' is enough to bring on your worst 'school disco' nightmares.And while the rest of the film is very much honed toward delivering a happy ending that comes from a dark enough place to deliver as a surprise twist, there is also plenty of time for a surprisingly gritty military drama. Richard Gere is a more nuanced character than most parts he plays, and Louis Gossett Jr. stands out as his harsh-but-fair training instructor.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",An Officer and a Gentleman
68,MartynGryphon,Get Jets!,10,31 July 2009,"An Officer & A Gentleman is one of those touching drama movies, which under normal circumstances I would break my own arm before putting into my sacred DVD player.However, AOAAG, is a surprisingly enjoyable addition to this despicable genre. I first saw it when I was 14 years old. It was the middle of the night, I couldn't sleep and of the 4 TV channels to choose from back then, It looked like the movie just starting on one of them was the best of a bad bunch. I watched paying little attention, then something happened in the plot that made me take a little bit more attention. Then another, and then another until I was gripped by this brilliant movie till the end credits.Richard Gere plays Zack Mayo, a loner from a broken home, who's mother committed suicide and whose father is an alcoholic, whore chasing sailor. He's grown up with no discipline and little parental affection. After realising that his life is on the same downward spiral as his fathers, and wanting to better himself, (and fly Jets) he enrols in the Navy's Officer Candidate School in Washington State.On Base, he comes under the hawk like eyes of his new D.I, Gunnery Sergeant Foley, (Louis Gossett Jr) A tough marine, who's seen it all, done it all and can anticipate every move his new class will make. He befriends some but not all of his classmates and manages to find time for romance on his leaves with local girl Paula, (Debra Winger), despite Foley's warnings of local girls who will try to get themselves pregnant in order to marry a Naval Aviator.Zack's naval career gets off to a rocky start as he immediately sets up a lucrative side business selling shiny buckles and boots to his fellow candidates. When Foley discovers this, his weekend leave is replaced with extensive punishment drill. During which time Foley tries to encourage Zack to quit saying that he's too selfish to be an officer. Zack has no intention of quitting because he's 'GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO!!!!'.Zack's lesson has been learnt and he realises that to be a successful officer you need to care just as much for the people around you rather than just look out for yourself and sadly, it takes the most tragic of circumstances for Zack to put this into practice.AOAAG is a brilliant movie with Gere & Winger an inspired choice of casting as they both fill their scenes with a sensual/sexual delivery that makes the scenes they share totally believable without being either sickly sweet or unnecessarily smutty. However accolades have to go to David Keith as Gere's ill fated fellow candidate and Louis Gossett Jnr who justly won an Oscar for his portrayal of The tough but caring D.I.Enjoy!!!",An Officer and a Gentleman
69,dav07dan02,Port Townsend and Tacoma Wa.,6,28 July 2005,"Director: Taylor Hackford, Script: Douglas Day Stewart, Cast: Richard Gere, Debra Winger, David Keith, Lisa Blount, Lou Gossett Jr., Lisa Eilbacher, Victor French.Zack Mayo(Richard Gere) had a troubled life. His mom committed suicide when he was just a small boy and his father was never there for him. To escape the problems of his past and turn his life around, he joins the navy officer program so he can fly jets. His father does not believe Zack has what it takes to be an officer and laughs at his son when he tells him he wants to join the navy. Zack goes off to the base at Fort Warden near Port Townsend, Wa. for his 12 week boot camp. He soon forms a bond with another candidate named Sid (David Keith). While off duty Zack and Sid meet two local factory workers named Paula(Debra Winger) and Lynette (Lisa Blount). Zack takes to Paula while Sid takes to Lynette.We are taken through a joyride of emotions as we watch the characters progress through this film both in their relationships and in struggles through basic training under the strong command of Sargent Foley in a very grand performance by Lou Gossett Jr. Mayo is very unfocused and arrogant at the beginning of his training but Sgt Foley changes this. Because of his ways, the Sargent puts Zack through hell you might say but he builds character out of Zack in the process. This is probably the best ever performance by Richard Gere. Debra Winger and David Keith also were great in their roles. Something happens to Sid toward the end of the film that is very sad. Lets just say his girlfriend,Lynette, ruined him. This is a film that could have played out like a t.v. mellow drama but the fine direction and strong performances from the cast made it much better. This movie will bring tears to the eyes in some parts and make you laugh in others. I thought the performance by Lou Gossett was phenomenal, my very favourite ever by him. My only real complaint about this film was the character of Zack's father. I think his character was way underdeveloped. It would have been nice to have seen some kind of reconciliation between Zack and his father. They should have showed him at Zack's graduation.",An Officer and a Gentleman
70,Ioreka,How did I once like this?,4,1 June 2020,"I came back to this film, maybe 25 years after having first seen it, recalling that I enjoyed it. And the classic Joe Cocker theme tune reinforced that memory. But what a profoundly unpleasant film this is, with it's heart in all the wrong places. The less said about the values base of the film, the better. Richard Gere's character has almost no appeal, Louis Gossett Jr. appears much more wooden now than previously, and it's only really Debra Winger who brings anything mildly redeeming to the show. It's not dated well, and frankly I'm embarrassed to own up to ever having enjoyed it.",An Officer and a Gentleman
71,Rinho18,My number 165 movie,7,24 January 2001,"An Officer and a gentleman is my number 165 movie. It is quite original and has a good story. That is : Richard Gere attends the army and there he meets a girl that he thinks is quite nice , and he starts loving her. But in the army he is kind-of bullied by the instructor ( but just as everyone else , too ) . one day, there was an IMDb poll question like this : Who played the best drill instructor ? 58,6 % said R. Lee Ermey / Gunnery Sgt. Hartman / Full Metal Jacket. And 20,3 % said Lou Gossett jr. / Sgt. Emil Foley / An Officer and a Gentleman. I also think that Gunnery Sgt. Hartman was in FMJ way better than Emil Foley in An Officer and a Gentleman. All in all, I rated AOaaG 7/10, but it is definitely not as good as Full metal jacket. I recommend it to people who liked Full Metal Jacket.",An Officer and a Gentleman

The rock-ballad soundtrack is cool. I get so transported I believe something really (actually) bad is going to happen,! Recommended this, with the beautiful Debra Winger as great alt-partner and definitely not the blond choice in this delightful romantic drama. There's also a bit of every genre almost: a military training (and recruiting) drama, even feminist as female heroes abound here, aclass tension, lots of nice very early 1980s fashion, and music, and there's probably a ladies who like men in white suits genre.",An Officer and a Gentleman

I was not disappointed.Sadly, they don't make films like this anymore. Both Richard Gere and Debra Winger actually pull together a love story that I enjoyed. In the years where all movies have a forced love story line, this film placed the love story into the plot without taking away from the growth of Gere's character.Excellent performance from Lewis Gossett Jr., David Keith, and Robert Loggia pulls this film into a category of film I reserve for the classics. An excellent summer night rental, grab the popcorn and enjoy this rarity with real characters you care about.This is what Proof of Life should have been.",An Officer and a Gentleman
74,SixtusXLIV,Did Stanley Kubrick got something out out this for FMJ?,4,16 April 2008,"This film as only one merit. To show that a professional army is nothing else but a bunch of criminals and promotes them to an higher ""status"".It is not new at all . At Waterloo, the movie, Wellington says ""Scum, they are all scum"". Another version of the same statement, loosely translated from a French auteur confirms this: "" The scum of the earth, contracted for drinking.. It's a wonder that we made from it brave fighters"".In Officer an Gentleman, the drinking rewards are substituted for sexual pleasures. As befits the times...There is a big difference between this ""war propaganda"" and Kubrick's objective outcome. Perhaps the character of the ""drill Sergeant"" was copied by Kubrick from this. Since SK is no longer amongst us I would rather be pleased to know that both reflect the true reality. Army training is designed to ""make a beast out of a man""..This movies glorifies such process. Wellington used it, but did not approve. An English ""gentleman"" has to be an hypocrite, otherwise no gentleman..In the near future, new Empires will rise. My only hope is that they will only destroy the Western military apparatus and keep our civilization, that they seem, and indeed have, in the case of Japan, adopted.But do not rely on this for sure. The West has humiliated China for about a century (1860-1950). Expect vengeance...",An Officer and a Gentleman
75,MovieRat-2,A romantic military movie?,7,30 September 1999,"Those who are looking for a Full Metal Jacket type of film, don't even bother.   I was anticipating the typical ""boot camp"" sort of film but instead I found a Romance that was covered in sheep's wool (a military background).If viewed as a love story, you won't be dissapointed.  If viewed as a another ""Boot Camp"" film...you will probably be dissapointed.Yet what most people fail to mention, or even realize, is that this film has the most realistic and best fight scene ever!  The third or second to last scene where Mayo has the little brawl with his DI (drill instructor) is absolutely fantastic.  It doesn't follow the normal Hollywood or Hong Kong fight were the hero or the main character goes out and wipes the floor of his opponent.  This fight does something totally unheard of...it lets the ""bad guy,"" in this case the DI, win!!!My rating:   7 for a Romance; 4 for a Boot Camp film",An Officer and a Gentleman

I recently watched it again and it hasn't lost its appeal.I can't think of one thing about this film that is lacking or doesn't work. The cast is incredible. Louis Gossett, Jr. Deserves his Oscar for a compelling, flawless performance. He is amazing as a drill sergeant who turns coal into diamonds. A close second, in my opinion, is David Keith as Mayo's best friend. It's a supporting role, but Keith will tug at your heart at the end of the film. The principal actors, Gere and Winger, owe a lot to these two for their contribution to the development of their own characters and the success of the film.A great story, a beautiful soundtrack, and an ending that will make you feel good.

When Richard Gere goes into the factory and picks up Debra Winger by her machine, kisses her numerous times, and takes her out of the fatory forever, suddenly the viewer is uptlifted, optimistic for a moment, that fairy tales do at times come true.

Lou Gossetts career could have started and ended here (in my opinion it did) and been labeled a success. Nancy Klopper and Lynn Stalmaster should have received academy awards for casting. This is both a chick flick and guy movie with the Pisettings, Pugent sound shots and Mano a Mano conflict. The story line is such that any underachieving low life can think ""why not""...

He was so good in that film, like oscar-worthy good. Anyways, back to this film again, Debra Winger is really good as the character of Paula Pokrifki. And Lisa Blount gives a fine performance aswell.

83,davidsawyer-me,Great 80s classic movie,10,23 June 2012,"The 1980s were filled with great movies but this one was an instant classic for even back then. It had a nostalgic feel to it that gave it a yesteryear feel. This film was very moving and touching and brought a salt of the earth sort of tone to it that you mostly see in edgy movies from today. For example the very beginning was extremely edgy but done very tastefully, when Zach kept flash backing to his father not wanting to have much to do with him. Then in the present he had just spent the night in a supposed 3-way with a hooker and his Father Byron. The banter between him and his father with Byron's suggestive moves were just vague and ambiguous enough to be thought of nothing more than a man acting like a man (playing with his hand tucked into his underwear). The ""Graduation-Present"" lay sleeping as the father reaches for his son Zach who is leaving. A slight suggestive brush of his father's hand on his arm as he reaches for him not to leave. Not saying that any actual sexual contact was made between Zach and Byron other than the hooker between them, but it was there none the less. It gave it a haunting, touching, and emotionally charged feel. The longing Zach had for his fathers approval and to be close. Only to receive it in physical form via a female hooker, and possible incest that was only savagely and tastefully hinted or slightly suggested at. This didn't seem to scare the audience back then, but rather allow the radiance to use ""cognitive dissonance"" to grapple with the scene. The reason I share this view in such detail as I feel it sets a major tone for the film. It shows that Zach is trying to find something deeper than lust for a hooker (unlike his father). And at the same time trying to grow up without the nurturing his father didn't give him. He took what he could from what little attention his Dad gave him. To tear apart from that was like Velcro. To rip and tear away from the pull of one's own selfish motives and seek out something deeper. When he covered the eagle with the patch was a signal of his restraint. That he didn't want to be too free. But rather more focused on his own life and goals. I have more to say on this but I've written a lot already. This movie had so many different aspects (both hidden and obvious) to talk about that I couldn't point them all out in just one review. It was a great dynamic movie. And at times even underrated. But it did get plenty of accolades right from the start. Great love story between a man and a woman, great coming of age movie, great drama, very good writing, and had a awesome soundtrack.",An Officer and a Gentleman

College graduate Zack Mayo (Gere) enlists in the Naval Officer Candidate programme to realize his ambition of flying fighter jets, and also to escape a haunted past of his mother's suicide and his alcoholic sailor father.While training, not only does he have to survive the Drill Instructor (Gossett Jr) but he also recognises the solitude that has been holding him back his whole life. Throw Debra Winger into the mix as the girl looking for a husband amongst the class and David Keith as Mayo's best friend with his own problems, then you have this classic movie.I have seen this movie many times and it never gets boring. Richard Gere is at his most powerful here and I don't think he's ever had a better role. The supporting cast is also solid, with Gossett Jr. firmly deserving his Academy Award and Winger proving once again that she is thoroughly underrated by Hollywood.A firm 10/10 from me.",An Officer and a Gentleman
87,DutchECK,Two thumbs down...,2,24 April 2003,"An officer and a gentleman tries to combine two plots:1) a good-for-nothing tries to make it in the navy and2) A romance between two people from different social standards.These are two genres that CAN mix, but director Taylor Hackford just didn't succeed. In two hours, he showed 13 weeks of military training, a developing romance and character building. As I said before, this can be done, but Hackford just scratched the surface with every plot. He just took too little time to really show the essence of each plot. Hackford skips entire weeks and that's what killed this movie. If he stuck with 1 story (the navy one would be the best if you ask me), he probably would have made a great movie. Trying to stuff the movie with plots is not the only mistake Hackford made. His choice of actors was another. Richard Gere wasn't really at his best here. He just overacted too obvious. The scene where Mayo said the famous line ""I've got nowhere else to go"" was clearly overacted. A couple of minutes before that, Mayo said ""I ain't gonna quit"". My stomach twisted when he said that, it was simply too overacted. So, what've we got: a bad story and a really bad male lead. OK, I can see you think ""Where does that one star come from?"" Well, there was one thing I did like about the film, which was the music. I simply love `Up where we belong'...",An Officer and a Gentleman

90,beermonsteruk,Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong,8,2 August 2020,"1982 had some smash hit blockbusters, ET and Tootsie to name a few, but An Officer And A Gentlemen was also another hit, which further enhanced Richard Geres stardom (after an excellent performance in American Gigolo) after a well received performance as Zack Mayo, a Navy brat who has big ambitions himself to be a US Navy officer.Zack Mayo's mother commited suicide when he was a boy so he grew up with his Father in Subic bay, a navy base in the Philippines, his Dad, (who seemed more interested in drinking and whoring than being a proper Father), had doubts about Zacks interest in a Naval career, Zack, determined not only to prove him wrong but also to himself, signs up to the Aviation Officer Candidate School.As Zack goes against his father's wishes and signs up to 13 weeks at Officer Candidate School, he and his fellow recruits are put through an extremely tough and vigorous regime by the Drill Seargent Emil Foley (an excellent performance by Louis Gossett Jr), his tough and unrelenting style causes a fair few to drop out, also warning Zack and the others, about getting involved with the local girls from the area, though Zack and another recruit with whom he becomes friends with, Sid Worley, soon get involved with a couple of local Factory girls.As Zack and Sid become close friends and both heavily involved with the girls, complications occur particularly when it's revealed Sid has a fiance back at home, and Zack too has problems well as the increasing tension with Drill Seargent Foley reaches boiling point, as well as a heartbreaking tragedy.This film was a massive hit, and it's not hard to see why, and Richard Gere cemented his status here, a good performance, as well as the hit song by Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warren, helped this as one of the biggest hit films of the year, a fine job by director Taylor Hickford, strongly recommended.",An Officer and a Gentleman

It did give me somewhat of an idea of what to expect when I joined the Marines and went to boot camp...somewhat...ours was MUCH worse...lol! Anyway, the plus side to this movie is the simple fact that you can emotionally attach yourself to these characters. I think all of the actors did a great job, and I became an instant Gosset Jr. fan after this one. Until Iron Eagle....UGH! Louis, WHAT were you thinking? The only scene I found unrealistic was toward the end, after Sid's death, when Mayo confronted Foley in front of the platoon, calling him out. In the real military world, Mayo would have been locked up quicker than a flash for insubordination. Same applies to the scene where he confronted Foley after Sid's DOR. But, Hollywood had to give the audience the satisfaction of the underling turning around and picking on the big, bad drill instructor.The 80's were a simple time...and this is a simple, easy to follow movie. I'll still watch it to this day, and enjoy it every time.I understand Debra Winger was miserable during the filming of this movie. Especially during one particular intimate scene with Gere...she did NOT want to film that scene, but went through with it. The tears falling down her cheek are there for this very reason.

But it ain't a good movie. It's average at best. It is full of clichés and it is a 1 hour and 50 minutes long advertiser for the U.S. Navy. And I ain't kidding. Nearly every one in this movie is oh, so brave and daring. This movie only contains three good scenes. Only 3 good scenes. Those are: When Seegar finally makes it over the obstacle, which is a cliché but is still kind of sweet. The other one is the fight between Zack and Foley, and the last one is the last scene which is still a classic.

The characters are well developed, and the acting is superb all round from Richard Gere and Debra Winger to Louis Gossett(who won a best supporting academy award). I would not classify this film as a romantic one per-se, but more like a sweeping drama with a romantic ending.

101,stephen-1956,Perfect film for Gere but...............,7,24 October 2020,"There is no doubt who steals this film. Richard Gere is perfect as Zak Mayo, David Keith and Debra Winger are decent support, but the film is taken over by the brilliant Louis Gossett Jr. He is fantastic as sergeant Foley and every scene he is in he takes over. Otherwise, I found the film entertaining, but soppy and silly in parts, especially the ending although I'm sure this is the ending most expected. Keith's suicide scene is well played, as are scenes in the bunkhouse, but in my mind the best parts of this film all featured Louis Gossett Jr.",An Officer and a Gentleman

Richard Gere acts as if he is the consummate low-life-user-loser (not as low however as his father, played as if it was natural for him by Robert Loggia), until he experiences numerous maturation lessons in the serious game we call life. What makes this movie (and all similarly toned movies for that matter), cheesy is they distill the melodramatic moments of life in the span of a few hours of a movie. Louis Gossett, Jr. won an Academy Award for a one of a kind portrayal of the disciplinarian drill instructor who falters at times dealing with ""Mayonnaise"". Brilliant acting on Mr. Gossetts part. Taylor Hackford does a magnificent job of drawing out the inherent skills of all players, Debra Winger, David Keith, Lisa Blount, Lisa Eilbacher et al, directing them to convey to the audience the writers intent.

104,Gator1955,A Few Factual Corrections and a Comment,8,18 January 2006,"First, there is not, and never was, an Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) in Washington state. I would assume it was used because the true locale for AOCS, Pensacola, FL, wasn't suitable for some reason. Officer candidates going to AOCS already have their degrees and are undergoing training, physical and educational, to earn their commission. No, it's not four years like the Naval Academy, but then again, it's not four years of hell at the Academy, as another reviewer attempted to posit. Any officer commissioned through AOCS is an officer just like an academy grad and both, ultimately, can end up with regular commissions vice reserve commissions.Next, the training at AOCS was fairly accurately portrayed in the movie. Lots of running, swimming, academics, inspections, etc. all intended to result in the individual becoming part of a team. Another reviewer, obviously not a Republican (LOL), detests this movie just because of his perception that it endorsed the philosophy of the Reagan years. Utter balderdash, of course. What this movie portrays, again fairly accurately, is the growth of a loner into someone who realizes, as Spock so eloquently stated in one of the Star Trek movies, ""(t)he needs of the many outweigh the needs, or the wants, of the one or the few."" Mayo learns to be part of a team; he learns to care for others and cease being a ""user"" of people in his life...an example he learned from his father.The terminology, during the 80s when I went through AOCS, was still DOR...""Drop On Request."" It was an ""out"" exercised by very few people, mostly because those of us in AOCS were already motivated to come into the Navy and specifically into Naval Aviation. The rigors, as stated previously, are presented fairly accurately although a little melodramatic in places, e.g., the altitude chamber. Never in all my years in the Navy did I see anyone ""freak"" out in the chamber, which is a required test, along with swim quals, every four years to remain qualified to fly.The legend of the ""Pensacola Debs"" was presented to us early on in AOCS. Yes, there are stories, many of them true, of men meeting their wives while going through training in Penasacola, but I'd wager there's not a higher incidence in P'cola than there is at any military base or college town for that matter. Odd, but you put men and women in the same room and some will pair off, and some will marry and remain together forever. The bar in the film, TJ's, was based on a bar in Penascola named Trader Jon's. Trader had a running deal that if you caught him wearing matching socks, you'd get some prize...can't remember if it was money or drinks. Let's just say, he never paid off as far as I know. Trader died a few years back, but I'm pretty sure some of the stuff from his bar is probably at the Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola.The Drill Instructor portrayal by Louis Gossett is VERY true to life! While they cussed us, screamed at us, pushed us physically and looked for what would ""trip"" us up, they also, in retrospect, wanted us to succeed. One thing they never did, and would have been severely disciplined for, was hit us, so the fight scene, while improbable, works in the movie. PTing us into the ground, though...you bet they did! This movie works for me because I lived the life both during the AOCS part and during a career in the Navy in aviation. The portrayals are pretty much spot-on and believable. Sure there's dramatic license, but there is in any movie! Anyone who believes Full Metal Jacket tells it ""like it is"" is delusional; there's plenty of dramatic license there, too. Relax, enjoy the movie. It's about personal growth, love, and sacrifice; all in all good things. Not the best movie ever made, but certainly not the worst!",An Officer and a Gentleman
105,lessers,One of the funniest things I've ever seen.,10,28 September 1999,"This film was definetly not bad. It was pretty cool. A fairly funny film with Richard Gere as Zack Mayo. A pretty hilarious guy. His girlfriend Paula, played by Debra Winger was a really great girl. I wasn't keen on Lynnette Pomeroy. She ditched Sid and it resulted in disaster. Lynnette was Paula's friend who was a bimbo! But in this film I found humour, friendship, and how to get someone without faking anything.",An Officer and a Gentleman
106,anfinke,A great and honest movie!,8,8 June 2005,"I am a huge fan of ""Full Metal Jacket"", but I think it is wrong to compare this movie w/ ""An Officer and A Gentleman"", they are just too different. It is no surprise that Louis Gosset Jr. won on Oscar for ""best supporting actor"", he was very convincing!! This movie is a good example of great characters and the dynamics between them. They were all great!! Richard Gere plays a likable loner. But he is less arrogant than he is untrusting, and I think Foley finally gains some respect for him when he realizes this. The most memorable scenes for me were when Seegar couldn't make it up the wall the first time and she caves into tears at Foley's caustic (and very funny!) comments. The scenerio were she finally makes it over due to Mayo's newfound concern and trust of others is also great and shows his maturing. But I think Louis Gosset Jr. shines the most when he challenges Mayo to a fight (I believe he did this out of respect for Mayo as a last ditch effort to keep him from dropping out), a wonderful scene indeed!! Debra Winger was some serious eye-candy in this flick and Lisa Eilbacher has the cutest doll face. Great characters and cast!",An Officer and a Gentleman
107,stefan-reindl,"A classic tale of love, hate, life and death.",7,18 January 2006,"An Officer and a Gentleman is not your average love story. Although it follows the basic outline of a stock romance flick, this film deviates from the magical, rosy, sunny world in which most love films take place into the grim and dark realm of reality. That is not to say that An Officer and a Gentleman is depressing, but you do have to be in the right mood to watch and enjoy it.Richard Gere plays Zack Mayo, a young man who joins a Navy flight school to escape the world of his father, an alcoholic and a womanizer. His mother committed suicide when he was a boy and he was then taken into the custody of his father, a military man himself, stationed in south-east Asia. While his father was out chasing prostitutes, young Zack was left to fend for himself in the rough, foreign streets. He grows to hate his father and fears that some day he may end up his like his father himself. So, once he's old enough, he joins the Navy to learn to fly jets, and to give his life some direction away from that of his father.His journey is both hindered and helped by gunnery sergeant Foley, played by Louis Gossett Jr. (who won an academy award for his powerful performance) who puts him and his comrades through hell to expose any potential weaknesses.And, of course, Zack meets a girl, but it isn't love at first sight as much as lust at first glance. Zack meets Paula, who isn't from a perfect family either, at a dance and hooks up with her for what was originally intended to be a ""one-night-stand"" relationship. But that mentality soon goes out the window as they are slowly and discretely drawn together. Excellent performances by both Richard Gere and Debra Winger make their relationship seem all the more believable.Taylor Hackford has done an excellent job directing this film, giving it the feel of a classic romance with a few twists. The cinematography is textbook, making the film easy to follow but not overly simple. The ending scene, with the title theme playing and a big freeze frame finale, is of such emotional power that has not been seen since Rocky. It is also said that it was Hackford who forced such emotion from Gere and Winger.An Officer and a Gentleman is all about relationships. Not just male-female relationships like that of Zack and Paula, but also the equally powerful relationships of Zack and his father or Sgt. Foley. Zack is not a perfect person, in fact, at times he can be a total jerk, which adds to the realism of the story. Taylor Hackford has used Gere, Winger and Gossett to create a classic tale of love, hate, life and death.",An Officer and a Gentleman

This film is GREAT! I saw it for the first time three days ago, and have watched it three additional times since then. I have to add my kudos for all the actors and actresses involved. They all did a fantastic job which led to a very believable movie, which, in my opinion, when you can do that, you have created a successful film.

He falls in love for the first time, and he does become an officer and a gentleman.  Watch carefully, and you will see him artfully dodge any committments until the end of the movie.

Every character is given a lot of depth and there must at least be 1 character you can relate to. Louis Gosset Jr got an Oscar for his great performance in this film but the rest is also in top form. From the grumpy ""dad"" of Paula to the scared Daniels. It just doesn't feel like they're acting. The energy between Gere and Winger is always there. This is Gere's best performance by far.The theme music is legendary and fits the feeling of the film perfectly. Some great other 80's gems in there too (ZZ Top, Dire Straits) The direction and camera work are topnotch as well. I just love the editing right at the end.I won't go deep into the story. But basically it's about a egocentric man who doesn't give a **** about anybody else (Foley's words) changing because of the friendship he gets from his best friend and girlfriend. The themes of the film are universal. Friendship, Honor, change, loyalty.A film that is entertaining from the beginning until the (predictable but yet great and tear jerking) end. A film that you can watch alone or with your girlfriend (or not, maybe she wants to go for the knight in shining armor after seeing this one)Just see this one, i promise you want be disappointed.

111,Naamah,A film that hits at the heart,9,8 August 1999,"This movie is a classic that will make you cry every time.Though I have never been in through military training, I found Louis Gossett Jr.'s performance to be a very convincing as well as intimidating.  Not once did I feel that Sgt. Foley was too soft or unnecessarily hard on any of the Naval officer recruits.Debra Winger, though seemingly lost in some scenes, truly makes the viewer believe in her love of Richard Gere.  Equally, Lisa Blout carries a wonderful performance of a young, selfish girl who is torn between her compassion and her dreams.Richard Gere is at his best.  The scenes where Mayo is forced to deal with his emotions are riveting and even better are the scenes were Mayo has to deal with Sgt. Foley.  Gossett Jr. and Gere play great opposite each other.This movie is a great love story as well as an honest portrayal of a man being forced to deal with his mixed emotions in a search for inner peace and a life as a gentleman.

The movie brings hopelessness, sadness, compassion, anger, and happiness into 2+ hours.Hopelessness- the scene where the sarge has broken Mayo down to admit to having no where else to go. Sadness- .........Compassion-Mayo helping the woman soldier over the wall to sacrifice his ""record"", Anger- Mayo's anger with the world in general and with the Sarge ......Happiness- Obviously the last scene.The theme song is great and Debra Winger is a knockout!

114,rhardawa,this film is even better twenty five years later,10,3 May 2008,"I had not seen this movie for at least twenty years, but seeing it again recently on a movie channel with my daughter ( a graduate of the Air force Academy),brought back both memories of my own experience at Navy JAG OCS (which is not nearly as physically demanding as aviation OCS)as well as seeing the movie when it first came out. Upon seeing it again, I am convinced that along with High Noon, Casablanca, and ""Twelve O'Clock High"", it is one of the best movies ever made. Like ""Twelve O'Clock High"", I also think it should be required viewing at both OCS schools and military academies. Compared to the screenplays I see today, the screenplay of this film screenplay now seems close to perfect in terms of how it tells a coherent story while at the same time being both uplifting, didactic, and entertaining all at the same time. So many films today are disjointed, badly edited, and wagged by the tail of special effects. Although I have never been much of a Ricahrd Gere fan, he was perfect for this particular role, as he was also in ""Chicago"". I read in one of the reviews that Debra Winger was not happy with her performance in this film, but I can not imagine why. Like ""Chicago"", this film comes as close to being perfect as a film can get. As for realism, the only comment my daughter had to say was that the high pressure chamber was a piece of cake, at least when she took it, and she never knew anyone to have any problem with it (although she said a lot of cadets had a problem with the tear gas and gas masks.)",An Officer and a Gentleman
115,elvismanson,More true than you might think.,10,18 February 2005,"I went to Navy OCS (for ship drivers, not aviators) a year after this movie came out. A lot of us considered it one of the best movies ever made. Despite the fact that there is some serious license taken with reality, the movie captures the intensity and high stakes of OCS, and how people who barely know each other become bonded so quickly; how the least likely candidates sometimes become the star performers; how some people are changed beyond recognition by the experience. There was never a lack of old hands like Sid's father, telling you you had it easy because of some difference in the rules he didn't enjoy 10 years earlier. DOR is translated by Foley as ""drop on request"". In 1983, the terminology was DE, which meant dis enroll. I always wondered what happened to the candidates in my class who DE'd. The ones who graduated I kept running into in the fleet, sometimes in places like the Philippines. The most unrealistic thing about the movie was the premise that local girls want to marry officer candidates. Not so in Pensacola or Newport RI, where OCS was in those days. The locals actually called us behind our backs ""cockroaches"" because we wore all black and had to run away to our barracks by 10 pm. The second most unrealistic thing was the foul language. That comes later, in the fleet, but not in OCS. No we did not have martial arts duels. All in all, however, the essence of the experience, if not the specifics, is found in the movie. One of our marching songs went ""left right left right / you HAD a good job and you LEFT / you're RIGHT!"" We really did have nowhere else to go. I say 10 stars. The VHS version gets only 8 because of changes to the soundtrack songs.",An Officer and a Gentleman
116,aehome10,My All-Time Favorite Movie!,9,17 July 2021,"I did not see this movie until about '83-'84 and I was instantly inspired. Compared to Top Gun (though widely different plot line) this is much more inspiring. The BEST, albeit brief, line in the movie is Zack Mayo's challenge to Candidate Seegar as she is failing to climb the requisite wall on the obstacle course, ""Do you want jets?!"" This charge to Seegar got her over the wall and also lit I fire in my belly. I joined the army reserves in '89 probably due to this movie, though I was instantly commissioned as an officer due to my college and professional degree. I was activated in late 1990-1991 to active duty and at age 29, that was a challenge. We were a medical unit and I had only 1 year prior to the call up (from reserve status) to learn how to be an army officer - I already knew how to be a registered nurse when I joined. So the charge, ""Do you want jets?!"", played over and over in my head. It was my "" now walk the walk"" moment , as I suddenly found myself on active duty and stationed away from home. Being a female officer was not as tough as I expected, and I also caught the gunnery sergeants, ""Sir, "" verbiage when he addressed Ensign Seegar on graduation day. This film is totally epic and the suicide of Zack's friend was spot on: I experienced 1 soldier's suicide attempt while activated, though we intervened right away - not sure if CPR was a thing back in the days of this movie's inception. Having a peer commit suicide is an ""it doesn't have to be this way"" moment, followed by a ""Dear God, I'll never forget this day"", gut-wrenching feeling. Couldn't relate to the romance aspect of the film though as I was already married when I was thrust onto active duty with 72 hours notice to get my a** to my duty station. I still cry over this movie since I'm an old softie now. Better casting could NOT have been done.",An Officer and a Gentleman
117,slflister,"Loner rebel Richard Gere joins the navy to become a pilot and find himself with the help of his friends, lover, and generic tough drill sergeant in this romantic drama",4,30 November 2015,"Let me preface this with a statement about myself, for me, it's really difficult to like a romantic movie because I cant enjoy it unless it feels real to me, and making fake love seem real isn't easy. However the reason the love in this movie doesn't feel real to me isn't because the acting is bad or because there's just no chemistry between the two main lovers, Richard Gere and Debra Winger, the issue is that this entire movie is just a gigantic pizza which is 80% cheesiness and 20% movie.The movie only ever manages to have one genuinely good part, the climax, when David Keith offs himself in a motel room with a belt in the shower, something truly sad and something that made me feel a connection to his character and disdain for his ex-lover who had pushed him off the edge. Shortly after however it seems like the movie just forgets this whole entire incident with little collateral damage beyond Gere mouthing off to the gunnery sergeant and having a grudge match that leads to (not even joking) Gere getting kicked in the balls and lying down in the fetal position after him and Gossett exchange a few pseudo karate kicks.Its a shame too, mostly because Gere's character could have been much more interesting, what with his background being raised by his alcoholic father in the Philippines and ports around the world, but the movie seems all to eager to move past that and just get to the part where he's a nice guy and marries the girl. Really he's only ever a jerk in the beginning and his jerkiness is only ever mildly apparent. yet they still try to make him seem like some disturbed rebel when the only edgy stuff he does is karate, riding motorcycles, not talking about feelings, and having a stash of boots and belt buckles he fenced off to his bunk mates, a kind of ridiculous plot point which leads to him and the sergeant having beef, but what was his purpose in doing it anyways? did he need money? did he just want to be edgy? did the screenwriter just want him to be edgy?The worst part is the end, if this were a cheese pizza the last slice would literally just be a melted piece of a cheese wheel, of course he commits to Winger and goes to her upon his graduation and lifts her up in the air joyously in love a mere 20 or so minutes after his closest friends suicide, and the credits roll leaving me, the audience, wondering where the last two hours of my life went with nothing to show for it but the memory of a crappy cheese pizza of a movie without a single pepperoni or topping in sight.smh 4/10",An Officer and a Gentleman
118,tstevens32,Anything Under An 8.0,8,18 August 2015,"A rating of anything under 8.0, to me is blasphemous. This film stands the test of time very easily, with further viewing only increasing ones view.At first, it seems like a cookie-cutter military drama played with a known denouement. We all knew the happy ending right? With that said, the road to get there is extremely satisfying, with some stellar acting from all parties.If it wasn't for the cast \ acting, the script would make this film mediocre; but the actors sold me each and every turn and saved the story. I was invested even after knowing the outcome.I have seen this film 10+ times now, and each time I view it, I appreciate the acting skills involved. I can only hazard a guess that this set was not a friendly one to actors; but dayum did they all deliver.Over time, this could break my top 25 of all time.It is very worthy of a review if you haven't already.",An Officer and a Gentleman
119,Chuck-169,"Sensitive, insightful performances. A first-rate movie!",10,12 August 1999,"This is a film that needs to be seen several times to be fully appreciated. Lou Gossett Jr. is superb as the Drill Instructor who transforms a gutter-snipe into officer material, and Richard Gere, normally a somewhat wooden actor (IMHO), shows what he is capable of in the hands of a skilled director. The story line may be a little unrealistic, but the performances are superb",An Officer and a Gentleman
120,pilembo,"A tour de force drama of multilevel impact. Realism, Romance, Comedy combine in a masterful even classic movie. movie",9,8 January 2001,"I was amazed to see the low ratings on this recent classic movie by Taylor Hackford. It brought forward young actors (Gere, Winger, Keith, Caruso) and older ones- Lou Gossett Jr.- with truly outstanding performances in an initially unknown film. What a treat to see it again. The actors, the setting, the depth and authenticity of this film were as powerful as ever. It was created and recreated from a real memoir of Naval Officer Training. It was reset in a wholly different world from Florida to Washington State but it was the people. the romance the realism of the feelings and conflicts of young people facing the world and each other that make it a grand operatic film. Scored with Rock and Roll and a famous Theme song, it is a movie about youth that speaks to all ages in both fantastic and dramatic terms. It has atmosphere remarkably authentic without the cooperation of the Navy. It is of its time - the 1980's yet is still meaningful in 2001. The story, directing and acting are fully outstanding. A must see for a classic movie fan!",An Officer and a Gentleman
121,syed3,One of the best movies of all time.,10,6 November 2006,"What can i say, i saw this movie when i was 10 (or a teenager) i think. I knew and remember that i liked it, but as i watched it again at 15 and then later at 22, i started loving it.Man, this is one of my favorite movies. The movie contains so much. Success, will power, depression, obstacles, confusion, love, lack of love, friendship, goal, help, toughness.The movie inspires me from every angle every time i see it. It inspires me to succeed against all odds life showers. It inspires me to look into friendship once again, it inspires me to look into love once again. :-) I hope all you viewers will somewhat (atleast if not all) agree with me.

123,ranastas,"A Story of Love, Honour, Teamwork",10,18 February 2002,"Contains Spoilers This movie is about the human condition and how the factors of love, discipline, sexuality, family ties and commitments can shape it to determine the decisions one makes in life. Zach Mayo (Richard Gere) must overcome his inability to get close to anyone, caused by the death of his mother and his father's way of bringing him up from port to port - never allowing him to have a fixed childhood where he could put down roots. He decides to join the Navy because he wants ""to fly jets"", perhaps an allusion to his lack of initimacy with anyone. During training he meets Paula (Debra Winger), a local girl, whose father, a former officer candidate, she never knew. The two develop a relationship which at first seems to be just another one of those typical and casual types between a trainee and a local girl - based on enjoying the moments while they last, and then it will be over when Zach graduates and gets his assignment in Pensacola. But Paula, who genuinely likes Zach, hopes it won't end this way. But with her mother's guidance, who's been through what she's going through, she is advised not to say or do anything to ""trap"" Zach into a permanent relationship. Paula has the strength and discipline to follow her mother's advice and allow Zach to move on, if that is what was meant to happen. Zach also shows strength, determination and discipline to overcome the obstacles put forth by his drill instructor (L. Gosset Jr.) and makes it through the 13 week program. But after the suicide of his friend Sid (David Keith) he feels it is over with Paula and he wants to move on. However, at his graduation ceremony, he feels he has earned his success but then notices one value still missing within when he realizes none of his family attended the graduation. So he decides to go and pick up Paula from work and take her with him into his new career. The ending is one of the best moments in cinematic history, as we see Zach walk proudly through the factory to surprise Paula and take her away from it all.",An Officer and a Gentleman
124,jaspertown77,Great story of self-discovery made even better by strong performances,9,18 June 2002,"'An Officer And A Gentleman' is a brilliant film with great performances from Richard Gere, Louis Gossett Jr. and Debra Winger. Richard Gere embodies the character of Zack Mayo, a troubled young man who, due to neglect and ill parenting by a military father, signs up with the Navy to get some direction in his misguided life.Mayo's life is made even harder by the ball-busting Sergeant Foley (Louis Gossett Jr.) upon his arrival at the barracks, and he struggles to find his place. However, he does find it in himself to stand-up to the overbearing Foley and his own inner-demons and, during the course of the film, goes from being selfish, weak and undisciplined to considerate, strong and determined. His will, as well as the love of the beautiful Paula (Debra Winger) and the guidance of Foley, makes him stay the course and lifts him 'up where he belongs'.Richard Gere is great in adding layers to what could have been a poorly drawn characterisation. Mayo is not always the 'good guy' and is more often than not a complete prick. Nevertheless, he undertakes a journey of self-discovery where he refuses to become a carbon copy of his father and takes hold of his own destiny, turning himself into the man he wants to be. Gere has never been better on film than when he screams, `I got nowhere else to go!' at Foley in such a heartbreaking howl that the audience can literally feel his pain.Debra Winger is also good as Paula, a downtrodden factory girl trapped in a small-minded small town with a lack of opportunities for women. She not only finds a way out in her love for Mayo, but the hope of a better future somewhere else. Louis Gossett Jr. also stands out as the foul-mouthed, domineering Sergeant Foley who proves to be pivotal in Mayo's journey.With a great soundtrack, strong performances and the most rousing and emotional final scene in a film since 'Rocky', 'An Officer And A Gentleman' deserves its place among the classics of film history.",An Officer and a Gentleman
125,joebeta,Richard Gere's best acting ever,8,5 January 2003,"I saw this film in a theater in 1982 when it was first released and just saw it again on DVD. Often one's positive memory of a film is challenged by a re-viewing 20 years later, but this film holds up and is still quite emotionally moving in depicting real people with real challenges to overcome. Personally I think Richard Gere is a prettyboy wooden actor, but for some reason (known only to himself I guess) he is excellent in this movie.",An Officer and a Gentleman

127,mikehayashi85,Fantastic Movie,10,8 May 2005,"This is one of the best films ever made. The movie made Richard Gere a star, John Travolta should have never turned down the role of Zack but he did,Travolta thought the movie wasn't going to be very good and his career at the time wasn't doing so hot either.Taylor Hackford was a nobody at the time and the Navy wanted nothing to do with the film the helicopter you see in the film was a friend of Hackford and did him a favor. Debra Winger was fantastic also as Paula and people are saying that she was uneasy doing that love scene but the reason why is that she hated Gere, in her opinion he played the part so well because he was playing himself in real life and that she could never get through to him which makes her performance even better. I lived in Port Townsend for two years where the film was made. The real name of the base is Fort Warden but the motel where Zack and Paula stay is called The Tides. I even stayed in the room where Zack and Paula stayed. That Motel has made a fortune on the movie the motel has even expanded they have a whole new section right next door.

The lines in the film are timeless, and still resonate years after seeing the film. ""I don't believe what I'm seein"" and ""where you from, boy""? Debra was outstanding. Why are films like this not made these days on a regular basis? I guess cartoons and internet graphics are what people want. The suicide was poignant, and the fight scenes well done. The nick names were spot on. The uniforms were clean. The jets echoed in the background. Oklahoma is now known beyond basketball, and home to more than steers and queers-I lived in OK and it was awesome. Let'shave more movies about OK and the fabulous people that live there.
