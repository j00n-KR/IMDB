0,TheLittleSongbird,Standing up for what's right,7,2 November 2018,"Was really intrigued by the idea of the story, which is a brave, important and relevant one with some very complex themes that have much relevance and importance today. Another main reason in seeing 'The Hate U Give' was that it was part of my quest to see and review as many 2018 films as possible, being such a huge fan of film of all genres, old and new. Even if it didn't quite work for me, would still have appreciated 'The Hate U Give' for what it tries to do.On the most part however, 'The Hate U Give' did work. Not always, some aspects could have been done better and there were things that the film could have done more with or easily done without. Can see why people like/love it, can also see why 'The Hate U Give' hasn't done it for some, how such a bold topic and its themes are executed is not something that will be universally liked.There are, as said, things that didn't quite work for me. 'The Hate U Give' did come over as longer than necessary, would have trimmed it by 15-20 minutes. The voice over is over-used and explains too much, over-explanatory voice-overs unless really crucial to the story has on numerous occasions not been necessary and annoyed and the film easily could have showed more and told less. It is a good thing that as the film progressed it was used less.Also thought that there was some contrived scripting, especially at the attempts at levity, and that parts could have done with more subtlety and tact as well as made much clearer.However, 'The Hate U Give' is well made visually and has stirring use of music. The direction is alert to the drama but also allows breathing space to allow what is happening to resonate. The characters have been criticised for being unsubtle stereotypes, to me they were very real and relatable and the way they were presented was not too one-sided. The acting is one of the best assets, after being in roles that were bright spots but deserving of much better material Amandla Sternberg gives a startling star-making lead performance finally showcasing her talent. Everybody else is very good, with the film remarkably getting the best out of actors who haven't at times amazed elsewhere, some career-best turns here.Most of the script does work very well, provoking a lot of thought and emotional wallop and its approach to the story and topics is intelligent and mostly does not preach. The story is compelling, effectively showing the true horrors of the situations without sugar-coating and making one feel very strongly about what's happening and relate. Many parts are gut wrenching and very emotional, was often very moved, and what is a bold and complex subject is presented as bold and complex, pulling no punches, very difficult to get right and done very bravely here. The positivity of its message doesn't jar and does warm the heart and induce tears.Overall, good film if falling short of greatness. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Hate U Give
1,SnoopyStyle,a star,7,10 November 2018,"Starr Carter lives in two worlds as two different people. Her family lives in the poor black neighborhood of Garden Heights. Drugs are pervasive. Her father spent time in prison after being the right hand man to drug lord King. He has since become a family man and the owner of a local grocery store. Her mother insists on sending the kids to a private school in the white neighborhood of Williamson. At the school, she has to act safe with white friends and white boyfriend Chris. Her friend Hailey acts more black than her. She attends a black party where shots are fired. Her childhood boyfriend Khalil drives her home and gets killed during a police traffic stop.The first half is amazing. Amandla Stenberg is engaging. Her two worlds existence is insightful. The shooting is handled with care. There are some awkward plot developments in the second half that are trying too hard. The first is her best friend. While I understand what the movie is trying to do, it needs to set up her character better if she is to turn out that way. What happens is a high hurdle to overcome. It's not like she gets it from one of those rich white girls who gives her the side-eyes. The stuff with King walks the line between tense drama and overblown melodrama. I would pull some of it back. While I am uncertain about some of the developments, I am still invested in Starr and her journey. She is the heart and this young actress is a real star.",The Hate U Give
2,kosmasp,Thug Life,10,4 March 2021,"If you've seen the movie, my summary line will make sense. Or if you are quite the Tupac fan of course. The movie starts off quite strong. I had seen a late night show interview, so I heard about the ... Talk. I also heard about this from a YouTube channel. Anyone unaware of this should be quite shocked to say the least. The fact that it has to be said, that it has to be something that children have to learn and memorize for the rest of their lives.Our main actress here tells many things in voice over, that we may expect and even know, but still don't think about too much. Especially if we have a lighter skin color (that means being white). Now if your first thought is to yell that this sounds like discrimination against white people, please do check yourself. This is not about you, unless you are the problem too of course. This about bringing awareness to issues that are not being adressed enough.The inciting incident is shocking and you questioning motives on both sides will not make you an evil person immediately. But when another talk happens, where Commons character lays down a different perspective where you may think certain things ... they all get squashed with one question our main character asks him ... if you are not convinced by that argument she's making ... well nothing will convince you.This gives food for thought - the subject matter is not easy. And if you don't have certain things happen to you and are not willing to accept a different perception ... well you probably will not like this movie at all. But you should know that from the start or even prior to that. Very strong in all aspects ...",The Hate U Give
3,paul_haakonsen,Seriously? This was ludicrous...,3,17 June 2019,"I will say that ""The Hate U Give"" started out nice enough and definitely had potential. The movie had some nice atmosphere built up and character introductions from director George Tillman Jr.But then everything just went down the drain. When and why, you might ask yourself. Well, when Khalil (played by Algee Smith) was asked to put his hands on the hood of the car and remain in place by a police officer, and then he blatantly disregarded the order given by the police officer and failed to comply, reaching into the car for a brush and ended up getting shot because the police officer thought he reached for a weapon. And then it because a political crusade against the police officer whom was doing his job, and the detained driver failed to comply with orders given and did something as stupid as what he did. Then I started to lose interest in the movie when it turned into a 'lets-turn-this-guy-into-a-martyr-despite-the-fact-he-disregarded-the-police' type of movie.I managed to endure about an hour and twenty minutes of the ordeal that ""The Hate U Give"" turned out to be, before I gave up because of the ludicrous turn of plot and storyline. It just became too much and left me with absolutely no sympathy for the Khalil character as he was stupid enough to go against the orders given by the police offer and the officer becoming a scapegoat for a vicious personal crusade.Up to the point where I gave up, I will admit that the movie had some nice acting performances, despite the ludicrous storyline and plot. Amandla Stenberg really carried the movie quite well, and this was the first time I have seen her in a movie.I have no intention of returning to watch this tacky and distasteful movie, because the storyline just spiraled so fast into stupidity and lunacy that every appeal the movie had vanished like dew before the morning sun. And even the good cast of actors and actresses couldn't manage to steer this ship away from the field of icebergs that writers Audrey Wells and Angie Thomas was driving the movie straight into, with director George Tillman Jr. at the helm.I think the movie simply thrives off of the fact that people are very much aware of police brutality and the fact that Afro-Americans get shot by police, but the movie was just too tacky to be entertaining to me. And the stupidity of the Khalil character was just the last straw that killed off the entire movie for me.I am sure that there is a large audience out there for a movie such as this, but I wanted to be entertained by a movie and not suffer through a personal crusaded spawned by a young man's failure to comply with an order issued by a police officer. Thanks, but no thanks.",The Hate U Give
4,Quinoa1984,"Turns out theres something more horrifying than Michael Myers in October, and that is... Death by the police.",7,22 November 2018,"Amanda Stenberg in a (no pun intended) Star making role, Regina King and Russell Hornsby's acting in particular and some truly powerful scenes and set pieces regarding the horrors of this human rights/justice crisis in this country helps to make up for some plotting and details (ie the end of the climax, the whole role of the drug Kingpin played by Mackie) that take it down to after-school special town.It works on the levels it needs to, and the things that dont work so well aren't a hinderence when it justifies itself as an *entertaining* important picture; it's good to have some real humor here, and theres one section where it becomes a bit like reverse Get Out for five minutes and it's just about perfect. So if you are expecting a sort of Spike Lee does a YA then, yeah, it is that. But Tillman Jr has a capable handle on tone that is paramount here. While I can gripe about some details, it is powerful stuff that is wholly realistic about the main story at hand, and the cast is uniformally triumphant with this.Lastly, I didnt realize till I looked just now at a Letterboxd review that the screenwriter died before the film came out. So sad, but for what its worth her work lives on here and will likely be part of high school classes for decades.",The Hate U Give
5,neil-476,"A strong leaning in one direction, but not bad",8,30 October 2018,"Starr is a teenage black girl with an identity crisis. Her ex-jailbird dad brought her up with strong teachings about how not to aggravate the police when - not ""if"" - you get pulled over for nothing. Her medical professional mother, keen to get the family out of the ghetto, has made sure that she attends of predominantly white high class school. So Starr balances her life between ghetto and privilege. Then, one night Khalil, who she has known since childhood, is giving her a lift home when they are pulled over by a cop, and Khalil is shot and killed: the weapon the cop thought he saw was a hairbrush. Suddenly Starr, as the only witness, faces great and conflicting pressures as this becomes a Black Lives Matter case.This is an agenda-driven movie. Having said that. like most agendas, there is some justification for it (though perhaps not quite as one-sided as this film leans towards).This is now the 4th film I have seen Amandla Stenberg - Starr - in, and the first in which she embraces her colour. She is very good in this. I doubt the film will register for awards, but her performance deserves to put her in contention for one.As a film it is quite gripping and doesn't glibly dismiss all the points it raises - some remain unresolved, in which it mirrors real life.",The Hate U Give
6,evanston_dad,The Hate U Give,8,19 February 2019,"There were a lot of movies this year about racism, a couple of them (""BlackkKlansman"" and ""Blindspotting"" come to mind) sharper edged than ""The Hate U Give."" But I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. Its passion about its subject matter and its enough-is-enough attitude help it to rise above its overly-earnest after school special trappings and its determination to look at the topic from too many different points of view. It especially starts to unravel in its final moments, as if the makers of it couldn't figure out how to resolve everything in a way both dramatically satisfying and cinematic, and its roots as a book show most starkly. But otherwise it's a very engaging film with some very good performances, most notably by its young star, Amandla Stenberg, who has the daunting task of carrying the entire film on her young shoulders. She proves herself equal to the task, though, and any immaturity she might have as an actress is used to the benefit of the character, a young lady who's thrust to the center of events she might not feel emotionally ready for.One of those movies that flew under the radar but that people should seek out.Grade: A",The Hate U Give
7,phd_travel,Most intense YAF!,8,17 August 2019,This starts of YAF with the very sweet and pretty black girl Amandla Stenberg and her high school romance with Riverdale's KJ Apa but gets serious and surprisingly intense because it's so relevant. The shooting of an unarmed black man by a white cop is the center of this drama. It's one thing to see this on the news but to see it in a movie it's quite impactful. The subject is handled quite well and thoroughly from impact on the witness to the aftermath. Really showcases the plight of poor African Americans and the difficult relationship with law enforcement. It's and emotional and at times incendiary topic and eye opening to watch on film.,The Hate U Give
8,deloudelouvain,"Police brutality and murders, and them getting away with it over and over again.",7,18 January 2019,"The Hate U give is one of those racial movies that will devide the reviews from very good to absolutely awful. The people giving it a one star are people that think they are role models of the society and that will never question authority while everyone knows that there are two different justices, the one for the poor and the one for the rich. It's nothing new that a black innocent guy gets shot for no reason and it will never change. Police brutality is something completely normal now, and them getting away with it over and over again says enough about the whole corrupted system. They are the rotten puppets of this society. The Hate U Give is well made, not perfect but good enough to make you question our society. A good job from Amandla Stenberg playing the main character Starr Carter. She runs this movie totally. As a movie it's a good movie, as a message it's one we all heared before, a message that alot of people agree with, and just a minority of racists that won't like it.",The Hate U Give
9,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Politically driven, ideological film that will inevitably draw sides",4,16 May 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningStarr Carter (Amanda Steinberg) goes to a mostly white prep school, where she must separate her existence between this world, and the black neighbourhood she lives in. Her father Maverick (Russell Hornsby) has a disdain for the police and teaches her and her brothers Seven (Lamar Johnson) and Sekani (TJ Wright) how to behave the day he believes they will inevitably be apprehended, while keeping sweet with King (Anthony Mackie), the local drug dealer. One night, Starr witnesses a close friend die at the hands of a white cop, catapulting her into a quest for justice.We are currently living in highly charged times, where ""social justice"" movements are springing up, challenging apparent inequalities in society. Probably the most prominent one at the moment is the 'Black Lives Matter' movement, which has taken up on both sides of the Atlantic, which appears to serve as the springboard for George Tillman Jr.'s The Hate U Give. The political position of the film is one that has resonated with the Hollywood circle, filled with performers whose image and brand is enhanced no end by 'virtue signalling' and siding with the apparently oppressed (despite often being as far removed themselves from these people as the oppressors themselves!)The catalyst for the film's grievance comes a good two thirds in, until which we sit through what feels like a typical American high school drama, of the type you might find on the Nickolodean channel (or starring Lindsay Lohan!) Tillman Jr. certainly tries to establish a fair bit of character development beforehand, where it suddenly occurs to us that the film's initials read 'THUG', and even get a dissection from the ill fated young black man about what Mr. Tupac Shakur meant by this as a life philosophy. After the event, the ideological slant is really hit home, trying to get us to feel empathy with a drug dealer, who 'had no other choice' and 'couldn't find any other work.'Tillman Jr. attempts some balance, with Starr's policeman uncle attempting to clear the record and explain why cops sometime act as they do. However, despite the fair performances and in-depth exploration, after such heavy handed showcasing, it will be more a case of the Stuff U Give, rather than the Hate U Give. **",The Hate U Give
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Incredibly compelling, frequently moving and very powerful; urgent viewing that demands to be seen.",8,27 October 2018,"After a brilliantly impactful opening scene, 'The Hate U Give (2018)' introduces us to some incredibly heavy-handed, out-of-place and mood-killing narration - its only real, but unfortunately quite major, issue. Though it's a shame it was included (to this extent, at least), it subsides somewhat after the first act, only popping up sporadically and to cap off proceedings, and it can't diminish the effect of the overall piece, as the picture really is a powerful, emotionally affecting experience that speaks volumes even at its quietest. It features many surprisingly poignant scenes and often cuts to the heart of an incredibly divisive, seemingly increasingly pervasive issue. It's certainly one of the most timely, thought-provoking and touching features of the year; I was almost brought to tears, and not just out of sadness, on several occasions. Aside from the narration, the flick rarely puts a foot wrong (which makes the voice-over all the more frustrating). Ultimately, it's incredibly compelling, frequently moving and, frankly, urgent viewing that demands to be seen. 8/10",The Hate U Give
11,ThomasDrufke,"Powerful, Moving, and Important",9,21 October 2018,"Powerful, poignant, and extremely timely, The Hate U Give is an intricate tale of racial prejudice, grief, and standing up for what you believe in even when it doesn't feel like there's a huge benefit from doing so. I was blown away by the overwhelming sense of emotional power that The Hate U Give shows. At times it may dip into melodramatic moments, but never strays too far away from letting you step into a young African American girl's shoes in the moments and day's following a personal tragedy that threatens to shatter her world forever.9.1/10",The Hate U Give
12,gbill-74877,Powerful,8,4 October 2021,"I'm going to start with this as it gets overlooked too easily because of the film's strong messages: Amandla Stenberg is brilliant. She has amazing screen presence and range here. Just a fantastic performance.The film is by no means perfect, as it sprawls at times and is too much 'by the numbers' at others. It tried to do just a little too much, and could have used more restraint.On the other hand, when it does connect, my god, the truths it speaks are searing. There is the obvious thing, how the police treat African-Americans, without giving them the benefit of the doubt, and how that has fatal consequences. There are also so many other things, like the separate worlds that white and black kids live in, how black people are portrayed in the media, and how subconscious bias (or more subtle forms of racism) are evident even in those who seem sympathetic. The representation and perspective shift are incredibly important, and the film more than succeeds in that.",The Hate U Give
13,851222,Good movie,8,1 September 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.While i found ""The Hate U Give"" (2018) to be a little too ""preachy"" and manipulative for me, i really enjoyed this movie for its great acting, especially by its young lead, very solid directing and some good writing. And while the story won't blow you away with its originality or anything like that, its an always appealing type of a story.Overall, at running time 2 h 10 min. ""The Hate U Give"" is like 10-15 min. too long in my opinion, and some ""truths"" were shouted in your face at the end so you could really understand what this movie is trying to tell you, and can't ignore the fact that i simply liked this movie because its was very well made.

16,cruise01,A strong emotional story and has a sharp direction.,8,1 February 2019,"The Hate U Give (4 out of 5 stars).The Hate U Give is a good powerful crime drama film about the fallout when a teenager Starr (Amandla Stenberg) witnesses her friend Khalil (Algee Smith) gets shot by a police officer when he did not even have a weapon. It does go over some powerful concept of black lives matter. With people wanting Starr to come out with the truth to reveal that they are living under fear when it comes to a police officer. That they are mistreated. The pressure is on Starr when she is threatened by a drug dealer known as King (Anthony Mackie) which Khalil use to work for him. He wants Starr to keep it quiet about what happened that night. While her supportive father Maverick (Russell Hornsby) is hoping she sticks up for her people. And her boyfriend Chris (K.J.

With Starr feeling like she is divided with going to a high privilege school Williamson. While she hides the truth from her friends that she lives in a rough black neighborhood Garden Heights. With a growing rampage towards the officer that shot Khalil and the crowd trying to protest for justice. Starr feeling like the weight of the world is on her. After witnessing her friend die, being threatened by a drug dealer, and her friend's loyalties are tested with the officer shooting. Amandla Stenberg delivered a good performance as Starr. Regina Hall, Russell Hornsby, and Common delivered a good performance. Anthony Mackie was decent as King. K.J. Apa was good as Chris, and trying to connect with Starr when she is trying to be distant. One thing I did not like about the film is it was lacking the depth of Starr's past. She is still struggling emotionally about losing her childhood friend. And it was only briefly shown.Overall, The Hate U Give is a good film. It has a powerful story. The cast is good.

17,eddie_baggins,An important and powerful film,8,2 June 2019,"Based on Angie Thomas's best-selling novel of the same name, The Hate U Give is one of those rare YA focused novels that not only translates well to screen, but tells an important, heartfelt message that will resonate with those both young and old.Directed by Men of Honor and Notorious filmmaker George Tillman Jr, Hate comes across as passionate and topical call to arms about America's race divide that is rampant across America, filled with a powerful heart and soul that stems from a scenario straight out of the news headlines of today.Starting out as a seemingly stereotypical high school/teenage coming of age experience with an African American tinge, Hate quickly becomes something so much more, as star in the making Amandla Stenberg's Starr Carter experiences the wrong-side of the law in a life changing event with her long-time best friend Khalil (charismatically played by Algae Smith, a Will Smith lookalike but no relation).Once this life changing occurrence takes place on one fateful night, Hate takes us on an unpredictable and deeply moving examination of what it's like to be a minority race in the United States at present, targeted and vilified by a law enforcement agency that sadly has failed to adapt itself to the needs and situations of the very people it has sworn to protect.While there are moments that feel a little shoehorned in or over-dramatized, most of Tillman Jr's film feels born wholly out of truth and experience, giving Hate a sense of purpose and meaning that can only come from the deepest recesses of the human condition.Importantly for the film also each and every one of the performers within this feature deliver the goods.Lead by the seriously impressive Stenberg, who grounds Starr with a performance wise beyond her years, Stenberg is ably supported by the likes of Common, K.J Apa, Regina Hall, Anthony Mackie and in a standout performance by Russell Hornsby as Starr's father Maverick, an ex-criminal who wants nothing more than his children to succeed where he didn't and live in a world that is more accepting and welcoming than he ever experienced growing up in the rough black neighborhood of Garden Heights.All in all there are many elements of Hate that combine to create a moving, engaging and highly powerful tale, offering an insight into a tough topic that nevertheless needs to be explored and discussed.Final Say -A film that champions the power of voice over the power of violence or divide, The Hate U Give is a rare example of a YA novel successfully transitioning to the big screen and a star-making vehicle for its young lead Stenberg.4 pairs of Nike Airs out of 5",The Hate U Give

20,Turfseer,Compelling take on Ferguson-like shooting through teenage eyes probably won't satisfy everyone on either side of the racial divide,6,26 September 2019,"The Hate U Give is based on a young adult novel by an African-American novelist, Angie Thomas. The screenplay, however, is by the late Audrey Wells, a white screenwriter who died of cancer at the young age of 58. Wells is pretty faithful to Thomas' novel, which tells the story of Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg), a 16 year middle-class African-American teenager living in the fictional black community of Garden Heights, somewhere in the State of Georgia.
Thomas does well in creating an interesting backstory for the Carter family. Her father, Maverick (Russell Hornsby), who owns a mom and pop grocery store in town, was formerly a King Lords gang member, who did a three year state prison stint so that King (Anthony Mackie), the gang leader, wouldn't have to take the rap. He's the stepfather to Starr's teenage half-siblings: Kenya (who lives with her mother, King's ""woman,"" and Seven, who now lives with the Carters).
The story-loosely based on the Ferguson, MO riots-has Starr getting a ride home with her childhood friend, Khalil, a young man now selling drugs and associated with the King Lords. When the car is stopped by a police officer on the pretext of a broken taillight, Starr (following guidance she learned from her father when she was a child), begs Khalil not to talk back to the police and place his hands on the dashboard so the police officer will know he's cooperating. Khalil, incensed over the officer's harsh treatment of him, talks back and is immediately ordered out of the car. When he reaches back into the car for a hairbrush, the officer mistakes it for a gun and shoots him dead.
Starr, who attends a virtually all-white prep school (and who has a white boyfriend, Chris) must now face pressures from all sides-which includes deciding whether to testify before the grand jury as to the events that led to the shooting of Khalil.
Egged on by an activist lawyer April Ofrah (Issa Rae), Starr finally decides to testify. Thomas' plot features a rather unlikely sub-plot involving King, who threatens Starr, as he feels her grand jury testimony involving Khalil, might bring out some unpleasant facts about his gang and their activities. But in reality, would this really happen? First of all he should know that Starr, an innocent teenager, would know little to nothing about Khalil's activities with the gang-and it's also unlikely she would discuss it during the grand jury testimony (as it turns out, Starr castigates the defense team for attempting to impugn Khalil's character by linking him to the gang).
In addition, failing to support the community's demand for justice for Khalil would be extremely bad publicity for the King Lords-who risk having everyone turn against them for not supporting the case against the police.
Perhaps the best moment in the film is Starr's conversation with Uncle Carlos (rapper Common), her maternal uncle, a police officer, who has sheltered the family after gang members shoot up the family home. Carlos tries to make Starr understand that the police officers are always on edge by the nature of their job; in this case, it's understandable that the officer would ""shoot first and ask questions later,"" as he truly believed the hairbrush Khalil pulled out of the car was actually a gun.
Starr's response is that if Khalil was white, he would not have reacted the same way and not shot the person he had pulled over for a routine traffic stop. Uncle Carlos' response is that ""it's complicated,"" which is probably true. Keep in mind Jesse Jackson's confession that if a man was walking behind him in a black neighborhood, he would be apprehensive, but not in a white one. Note that Thomas' narrative fails to develop the Carlos character nor is the point of view of the police developed either.There are already some African-American critics and viewers who don't like the idea that the community decides to work with the police to take down King and his gang, in effect giving up on their demand of ""justice"" for Khalil. The ""feel-good"" ending ties in with the unlikely idea that King would have threatened Starr in the first place and jeopardized their overall status in the community by ending up firebombing the Carter grocery store, with Starr and her half-brother Seven, inside.
Equally unlikely is the easy way in which the King and his gang are taken down. We learn that testimony by Starr's dad and witnesses at the scene of the firebombing lead to the conviction of the bad guys. But wouldn't they fear retaliation from other gang members who were not apprehended? It's a little too easy of a resolution.
Then there's Thomas' (and Wells') embrace of Starr in her new found militancy following the grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer who killed Khalil. Too many questions remain. Would the taking down of the King and the gang really have happened after the members of the community end up ""snitching""? Does Starr deep down feel the riots were justified? Was the police officer really guilty of murder or was Uncle Carlos right when sometimes police make mistakes in making split-second decisions? Do the hard and inflexible actions of police officers in enforcing the law often make the situation much worse than it should be?
Again, Uncle Carlos had the best response: ""it's complicated.""",The Hate U Give
21,jadavix,"Powerful sequences, unworthy happily-ever-after ending",7,11 September 2021,"""The Hate U Give"" deals head-on with perhaps the most contentious issue of its day, that being racism in the police force leading to the deaths of unarmed black men. However, the way it does it is strange. It was based on a young adult novel, and just as the main character has one foot in an underprivileged, all black neighbourhood and one foot in a mostly white private school, so too does the movie have one foot in a realistic story about police brutality, and another foot in a sugar coated teen fantasy world.The ending, for example, features a BLM-type riot first, and then a picture-perfect conclusion second, where everything's happier ever after.These are complicated issues. Violence begats violence. Only more black people, armed or otherwise, are going to die as a result of riots caused by police brutality. And not to mention the fact that the movie features the all-black neighbourhood coming out against one of its members, a gangster, despite the well known ""code of the streets"" and what everybody knows happens to ""snitches"".This ending was not worthy of the movie's more powerful sequences. It made me wish I was watching something based on a book written for adults, not teens. Then it MAY have had the courage not to try to go for easy answers.",The Hate U Give
22,kevin_robbins,This movie is a bit predictable but has a good message and unfolds well,8,25 July 2021,"The Hate U Give (2018) is a movie my fiancé and I watched while on vacation. The storyline follows a young lady on her way home with her best friend when he gets gunned down by police officers. Everyone around her seems to have an opinion on how she should handle the situation until her voice gets drowned out. Can the young lady find her forum to get her message out the way she feels most comfortable? This movie is directed by George Tillman Jr. (Men of Honor) and stars Amandla Stenberg (The Hunger Games), Regina Hall (Scary Movie), Common (Wanted), Issa Rae (Insecure) and Anthony Mackie (The Hurt Locker). The storyline for this is very well told and paced. The cast is well selected and delivers their characters well. The chemistry within the family and its dynamics are very apparent. The delivery of the main character was key to the films success and she was solid (not outstanding). Overall the movie is a bit predictable but has a good message and unfolds well. I'd score this a 7.5/10.",The Hate U Give

25,kirbylee70-599-526179,RACIAL TENSION,8,11 February 2019,"Racial tensions in this country are on the rise again. What once began to taper off is suddenly coming back. The one thing that remains is that those tensions aren't stoked by one person, one group or another. It is a much more complicated set of circumstances than can be found in the given number of letters found in a tweet. And much of the problems are not from the incidents taking place but from a press in need of news items to fill a 24/7 schedule and draw in viewers. Confrontation sells.The movie THE HATE U GIVE was released last year to little fanfare, favorable reviews and a modest box office success. It should have done better. The story covers the issue from a number of positions, shows the problems that can be found on all sides and tackles the issues we deal with daily in a way that should help all to understand better. Being white I will never know what it's like to be pulled over as a black man. But that doesn't mean I can't understand what it's like. This film deals with that issue and surrounds it with more.Amanda Stenberg stars as Starr Carter. Her father ""Mav"" Carter (Russell Hornsby) owns a small grocery store in their neighborhood of Garden Heights. Her mother Lisa (Regina Hall) works and wants the best for her children, a way to escape the low income neighborhood, so she sends them to a better school in an upper crust location.Starr is not a simple teen. She has two personas she calls Starr 1 and Starr 2. One she presents to the upper class white friends she has at school. The other is more hood oriented. Both are depicted here as completely different. What on the surface some would call cultural appropriation in the white friends she has it is honestly their adapting to what they learn and hear. They accept her and while they seem to be placating her they actually are just teens acting like teens. Her neighborhood friends are different. They frown on her attending the other school, in spite of the fact as Starr says early on the school there only results in drug use, gang membership and teen pregnancy.The two worlds collide in this movie but less in the friends around her and more in the single person named Starr. At a party in the neighborhood she runs into Khalil (Algee Smith), a friend she grew up with and had a crush on. Gunplay erupts and he offers to take her home. On the way there they are pulled over. Khalil argues with the officer about why he was pulled over, friendly but assertively. Starr tells him repeatedly what she was taught by her father, to do as you are told. When Khalil steps back to the driver's window after being told to stand at the back and reaches in to pick up a hairbrush, the officer shoots and kills him. Thus is set in motion the incidents that will forever change the life of Starr, her family and friends forever.The various viewpoints are presented her. The neighborhood is outraged over the incident. An activist tries to get Starr to come forward but to do so means discussing Khalil's occupation of dealing drugs for King (Anthony Mackie), a gang lord her father once worked for but left. The two have not seen eye to eye ever since. Starr knows that if she speaks out it will put her family in danger with the gang. She hesitates. But she realizes that if she doesn't speak then no one will for Khalil.What makes the movie work is a combination of performances, writing and taking one of the most open views on the topic of race relations I've ever seen on film. A few moments tend to bend towards the accusations of police brutality here but that's not the only thing that has caused what transpires to happen. A neighborhood where drug lords rule and no one stands up to them is another factor, one that leads the police to behave the way they do. And Starr's uncle is also an officer who sees things through the same eyes as the rest of the force. Blacks who are unwilling to defend their way of life are juxtaposed against whites who are unaware of what it transpiring and yet pay lip service to it. There are a ton of facets to this story and all combine to make it work. A cycle of violence is perpetuated by both sides, but Starr shows that there is a need to end that cycle.One performance that deserves mention here is that of Russell Hornsby. While everyone is good in this film it is sad that his performance didn't get notice or a nomination in any awards shows. It is so on the mark that it deserved to be recognized.Movies like this more often than not attempt to paint a portrait of one side as evil and the other as pure as snow. Reality lies somewhere in between. That's what this movie did with the topic at hand and in so doing gives us all a better understanding of the world we live in. Perhaps more people need to watch it, to understand both sides of the issue. And maybe in so doing things will head back towards where they were headed, where race wasn't an issue like it had been in the past.",The Hate U Give
26,masonfisk,A FILM FOR THESE TIMES...!,4,23 October 2018,"As hot as a hot button movie can be, we have this one which involves a community's & more importantly a teenage Black high school student's reaction to a police involved shooting of a young Black teen.

28,nancyldraper,This is an important movie and a very good film.,8,2 November 2018,"I think this is an important movie, it is also a very good movie. Full disclosure: I am a white, middle class, post-graduate educated, Canadian, born in the 50s. This is why this movie was important to me: I live in a city that has unjustly treated black communities and, although I have sought to be better informed about the history and the issues, my perspective has been from a distance. This film helped me understand that the expectational presets of being black are radically different from the presets of being white. Also, my understanding of cultural appropriation grew - I can see why whites emulating black culture is missing the point rather than establishing cultural bridges. But, most importantly, this film underlined for me the importance of each of us being authentic to who we are and to, humbly, engage in listening conversations, respect our differences and transcend that which divides us. That's was my take away. This is why this is a good film: I found the characters well drawn and the performances convincing (Amandla Stenberg is an actor to watch - she has been a credit to every role she's inhabited). The story was well crafted. The tragedy real and the relationships compelling. In our politically charged culture, there is an audience fatigue for movies with a point (I was disappointed to be only one of three people who came to watch this movie in the theatre), but don't miss this good movie, it's worth the watch.

The movie is based on Angie Thomas's heart hitting novel. I enjoyed the movie and I think cast was perfect.I was only surprised that the book and movie had same story but 80% of the scenes were rewritten significantly. The dialogues changed significantly from book and that made movie more tepid in comparison to book. As I read the book in days and watched the movie right after, it was fresh in my memory.I felt the book worked better not because books are always better than adaptations but because the dialogues and narration was really strong but in movie significant changes in every scene, bigger or small made it entirely different. It's a rare adaptation which has same scenes, characters, and story but rewritten with new dialogues made it bit different.People who loved the book, should like the movie too but people looking for others (cops) point of view this movie or book is not about that it's about a point of view which rarely gets to be seen or read.",The Hate U Give
31,martimusross,Avoid At All Costs,1,3 March 2019,"This movie was less of a movie more of a political rant, at the heart of it lays a black community riddled by a societal lack of opportunity, violent gangs, drug culture and endemic gun use.The movie sets out to establish and blame white society with the ""wildly held"" belief in black society that there lies a conscious and active conspiracy to oppress and abuse them for their lives and their lifestyles.This thought is then disturbingly realised in a series of emotive set pieces that deeply trivialise the real issues that lay at the heart of dysfunctional communities and presents no reasoned way forward. The real issues are firstly America's gun laws, secondly a vestigial welfare state and lastly affordable education.This movie on every level is a disaster and should be avoided as it just promotes division and outrage by its shallow emphasis of one set of facts over another without tackling at all the real underlying issues that follow from America's gun culture.More worryingly this movie is targeted at a teenage audience that might identify with the main character and as such this movie sends very dangerous political messages from a one-sided viewpoint.I would suggest if the policeman that had gunned down the black teenager had also been black the incident would have been the same with the same outcome.",The Hate U Give

33,bob-the-movie-man,It's a turf war on a global scale.,6,27 October 2018,"I saw this as part of a ""Secret Cinema"" event by Cineworld cinemas in the UK. That's where you go to see a pre-release movie without knowing what it is going to be. It's an interesting litmus test for a) a movie's upfront marketing appeal (how many people get up and walk out when the BBFC title appears) and b) the ""grab 'em early"" appeal of the movie itself (how many people get up and walk out during the first 20 minutes of so).I'm afraid this movie didn't do very well on either a) or b) at my showing: about 20 people left immediately, and more tellingly about another 20 people left in the first half hour. There's a reason for that: the first half hour of this film is plain awful!Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg) is a sixteen year-old resident of Garden Heights, a black neighbourhood in a US city, where she lives with her younger brother and step-brother. Their parents Maverick (Russell Hornsby, ""Fences"") and Lisa (Regina Hall) are devoting all of their energies to ""break the cycle"" and get their kids out of the neighbourhood and off to college and better futures. As such, the kids attend not the rough-house local school but a much more upper-class establishment: there Starr has to play a different role, with links to her origins being kept hidden even from her white boyfriend Chris (K.J. Apa).But all that changes when her boyhood friend Khalil (Algee Smith) is shot and killed in a police stop-and-search. As the only witness, and with Khalil linked to local gang lord King (Anthony Mackie), Starr's anonymous world is about to get a national focus shone onto it.Man... I hate voiceovers in films and always have. So I really hated the start of this film which has Starr narrating ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING (""Blah, blah, blah..""): no audience discovery is required. It also starts with a sort of highschool romance vibe, but not one that's well done with kissing (""Blah, blah, blah.."") while the local Mean Girls look on (""Blah, blah"") then with Starr's friends trying to act street (""blah, blah"") while Starr tries not to be street, all to the constant droning of Starr's voiceover (""Blah, blah, blah..""). (I never walk out of movies.... but I can kind of understand the rationale of those who did).Fortunately the voiceover then largely recedes (it only pops up with occasional staccato ""thoughts"", before storming back for a ""blah, blah"" finale). And with the shooting, the film takes on a much more interesting slant, giving Amandla Stenberg a chance to really shine.I have commented on Ms Stenberg before: she was the only really good thing in the recent ""The Darkest Minds"". Here she exhibits a tremendous range from the delighted (her smile is radiant and seems astonishingly unforced) to the heartbroken and furious. There's also a really strong supporting cast with great turns from Hornsby, Hall, Mackie and Smith. Hornsby in particular I found great as the Dad desperately tutoring his kids in military (but loving) fashion to avoid his mistakes.For me, this seemed to be a surprisingly atypical view of a black ghetto-living family. A scene set in a diner is genuinely touching at emphasising the loving and close-knit nature of the Carter family.Where I will struggle here is in trying to interpret my overall feelings about the film. As a white, older male person I have three degrees of separation from Starr's perspective. And these are undoubtedly difficult issues to juggle with. The riots that happened recently in towns like Ferguson ape the activities on screen uncomfortably. Your sympathies might lie to some degree with the unfortunate white police officer (Drew Starkey); sympathies supported by the views of Starr's police officer uncle Carlos (Common): until Starr points out via a punchy question that you REALLY shouldn't feel like that... and your views are brought up with a jolt.Aside from the rights and wrongs of the incident, there's a frustrating dichotomy at play in the film with black and white communities wanting to be treated equally but never wanting to be treated the same. ""You don't SEE me"" wails Starr. ""I see you"" replies Chris (as if James Cameron was directing!) But does he really? Without colour, I do not consider myself to be remotely capable of fully understanding Starr's perspective on life. It made me want to read the source novel by Angie Thomas to try to get better insight.Directed by George Tillman Jr., it's undoubtedly a mixed bag, but I came down in the end on the side of it being good rather than bad... it has certainly had me thinking for a couple of days. The clumsy voiceovers and story elements in the opening and closing scenes mask a number of parallel and interesting story strands that generate conflicting thoughts about the state of race relations in today's America. Jackson sang ""It doesn't matter if you're black or white"": and it really shouldn't, but actually in some quarters, it clearly still does.",The Hate U Give

36,Alexander_Blanchett,One of the most important films of the year,8,9 December 2018,"A very moving and absolutely important film that couldn't be more relevant these days.
The film tells the moving story about friendship, narrow-mindedness and the power of your voice and personality.
The most remaining qualities lie in the great storytelling, thanks to a very good screenplay (yeah some dialogues were a bit too preachy but the screenplay itself was very well crafted), and the fantastic acting.
We have newcomer Amandla Stenberg who will definitely go places after her breakthrough turn as Starr. She brings incredible soul and power to that role and really developes it incredibly. There is so much going on inside her character and Stenberg wonderfully brings that to life. Another fantastic performance came from Russell Hornsby who is thankfully getting some awards attention for it. His role as the good hearted past criminal father with the best of all intentions is so warmly down to earth and there is so much heart beneath all the thug-coverup. A fantastic performance by Hornsby who I have under the radar since is great turn in ""Fences"". Regina Hall is also pretty good as the caring and scared mother. A role you could have easily overacted but she was in perfect control of it. Anthony Mackie is the antagonist, he is fine and indeed scary. Nice to see Common here who has a fantastic scene towards the end.
The only thing you can blame the film for is that it at times feels a bit too one-sided.

39,andrewroy-04316,"Tillman does a great job adapting a complex novel, but struggles to balance the lighter coming of age tones with the darker social themes",7,19 January 2019,"While its source material is excellent, there's so much exposition and backstory that it is a truly impressive achievement how Tillman managed to maintain the key events and themes and tell the story in a consistent and coherent way. The acting is good all around, particularly Stenberg and Hornsby, and while Mackie is a fascinating and surprising casting choice, he plays his predatory, aggressive character well. The choices and changes they make I largely agree with (cutting out Devante is tough, but probably a good choice) and keep the film more compact. The change in Sekani holding the gun at the end was a brilliant choice, but the family staying in Garden Heights was a strange one. Where the movie really challenges itself and doesn't quite nail it is in balancing the two tones. The very end was the strongest example of this - after many intense, realistic scenes showing complex social interactions with racial undertones, the cinematography is suddenly bright and happy and everything works out perfectly in Garden Heights, the struggling area (King leaving won't change that much). It had worked so hard to show the systematic disadvantages blacks face, so to end the movie with the idea that if Starr just uses her voice, everything works out well served to undermine that. It seemed to waver between cliche, accessible to teens tropes and more gritty and nuanced racial commentary. I do think Tillman walked the line between the two successfully more often than not, but it still wasn't fully consistent to me. I didn't like the forced romantic element that was added to Khalil and Starr's interaction - it added nothing and was quite forced. Despite a few miscues and a frustrating ending, The Hate U Give is important and intelligently made, with thought-provoking social commentary just like the book.",The Hate U Give

41,bbewnylorac,"Intense, intelligent and ambitious film",8,22 May 2019,"This movie has got many excellent qualities. It's very sad that co-writer Audrey Wells died recently because her script, based on Angie Thomas's novel, is outstanding. It's crisp, witty, smart and engaging. I love how the characters aren't perfect. The father character Maverick Carter (Russell Hornsby) used to be a gang member, but is doing his best to run an honest business, a shop, and to raise his family in a moral way. The character of Khalil is a young drug dealer, but he's not completely a bad person. He's got many good points and doesn't deserve to die. As the movie's heroine, Starr, Amandla Stenberg is outstanding. She convincingly plays a very intelligent, well adjusted teenager who still struggles enormously to straddle both her tough, poor black neighbourhood and the very white school that her parents have enrolled her in, in an effort to improve her chances of a better life. Many, many other challenges come Starr's way, and she has to deal with them. Chiefly, she witnesses Khalil, her childhood friend, being shot dead by a white policeman who believes he has a gun. It's a shocking scene. This sparks a string of dilemmas - including whether Starr should she testify against the policeman - a very heavy situation for someone so young. There are many other issues such as the fact she's got a very white boyfriend, the fact her white girlfriends don't understand her situation, and her parents having to decide whether to move away from their gang-soaked and drug infested neighbourhood, or to stay and help change it. The movie gets very intense at the end and is probably a little over-baked in terms of drama and conflict. But mostly it reminded me, in a good way, of the movie Moonlight, in terms of a teenager, Starr, having to deal with issues at home that are unimaginable for some people, and in showing enormous empathy for her.",The Hate U Give

Performances are across the board outstanding, but special mention must go to Amandla Stenberg as Starr, the girl at the centre of it all - a nuanced, complex and believable character, superbly written in a terrific script. What's especially impressive is the movie's capacity to skewer liberal racism and crap like 'all lives matter' without resorting to straw men. It shows us that the oft-quoted call to 'speak truth to power' is easy and relatively uncostly for the privileged (like me); it's somewhat more painful and expensive for those who suffer under's power's heel.

She has had bit roles in Hunger Games, but here she portrays the anguish of her character and the metamorphosis of it, from someone who likes to blend in by keeping her racial identify at a backburner to someone who is acutely conscious of it, is pulled off in a breathtaking manner.It is an extremely important film to view.

47,themadmovieman,"A very mature, deep and fascinating drama delivered with incredible passion",8,26 October 2018,"I cannot understand why this film has gone so under the radar, because it really is a fantastic watch throughout. Delivered with intense passion that touches on a whole range of gritty and topical issues in incredibly hard-hitting fashion, while also featuring a beautifully heartwarming emotional core, as well as a stunning central performance from Amandla Stenberg, The Hate U Give proves a fascinating and exceptionally intense watch that grows and grows to boiling point over its long, but thoroughly engrossing runtime.Before I get into all of things that make this movie so impressive, I want to touch on the fact that it is actually a film in the YA (young adult) genre, based on a YA novel and released with a PG-13/12A rating. Given the intensity of the subject matter (and particularly the way that the film portrays it), it feels a very strange clash of genres that confused me for the opening twenty minutes or so.If you're thinking about letting younger children see this film, I would advise you to watch the film beforehand, because, to me at least, it feels a whole lot darker and grittier than something most 12 year olds can cope with. It is intended, however, to get an important message out to younger people, and with its young central lead in Amandla Stenberg, it does that brilliantly, but this film is a rather special case where the intensity of its subject matter really does feel a little too much for its proclaimed target audience.With that said, however, the fact that the film is so hard-hitting and so intense throughout is what makes it such an incredible watch at times, because it takes on a whole range of complex and very sensitive topics with immense passion and frankness, delving into them in a manner that I haven't seen achieved in any other film in years.You may think that you know the story. With reports on the news of black people being shot dead by police officers mistakenly thinking they were armed, it's a topic that's very much in the current consciousness, but what The Hate U Give does is go deeper than that simple headline, and really get into the factors surrounding why this sort of thing keeps happening, what can be done to stop it, and the unfortunate and almost always unreported consequences that reach much further into communities than just the immediate family of the deceased.In that, this film has so much to say about race relations in the modern day, and while there are tiny portions of its discourse that feel a little one-sided, it is a very level-headed and well-written piece that introduces so much depth and insight into a series of very contemporary issues.Going much further into the depths of the communities affected by these tragedies on such a regular basis, The Hate U Give brings out such power of emotion in a way that few other movies touching on the topics of race relations, black communities in modern day America, and an ever-growing sense of deep frustration and regret at the current state of affairs. If you think you've seen it all from Hollywood when it comes to those topics, then this film will prove an incredible surprise, offering a whole lot more than you could ever imagine from an outside perspective.The film is deliberately inflammatory with its gritty intensity throughout, grabbing you right by the throat and demonstrating the injustices and frustrations that many people suffer in the modern day, with the use of some pretty heavy violence, dark political themes, and a strong sense of passion and frustration in its delivery of that discourse. However, while it may seem that it's all dark and hard-hitting drama, there is another side to this movie that makes it even more striking.With the backdrop of a community in total disarray, with threats and oppression coming from all angles, there is a beautifully heartwarming core to this movie, centring on the Carter family, and how they navigate their way through a period of immense difficulty.While the film's political themes are its main focus, the fact that it takes time to stop and watch a family come together in times of hardship, despite a wide range of pressures that threaten to push them away from each other - whether it be the increasing media presence after the shooting, the socio-economic differences between the family and those of the children's classmates at a private school out of town, or the ever-present gangs in the local community.And at the centre of that family is Starr, played brilliantly by Amandla Stenberg. While all the performances are excellent across the board, Stenberg really shines in an incredibly mature and deep performance that far surpassed all of my expectations right back at the beginning.Once you come to realise that this isn't just a young adult story, but one that speaks volumes about far wider-reaching issues, Stenberg's stunning assurance and dramatic ability really hit home, as she goes from strength to strength showing her young character becoming deeper and deeper embroiled in a chaotic state of affairs, but growing at an incredible rate through experience and the unfortunate reality of her situation despite her age. She may not seem like much in the first twenty minutes, but the lengths to which Stenberg is able to take her character's arc through that performance are truly exceptional.Overall, I was blown away by The Hate U Give. It's not a film that I'd recommend for younger viewers, simply because of the intensity and grit of its main themes, but for those who can handle it, it proves a deeply fascinating and passionate movie that goes far deeper into a whole range of intensely political issues than any other film of recent years, while still retaining a beautifully heartwarming human core that is further evoked in Amandla Stenberg's brilliant central performance.",The Hate U Give
48,aminifatimaaa,speechlessly touching,9,17 February 2019,"In this world of growing violence, injustice, and casual racism, it makes sense for a film like The Hate U Give to exist, coming at us with full force, unashamedly thick in it's melodramatic strokes as it attempts to convey it's painful and scarring truths. It showcases the necessity in this day and age for a black individual, even at upon youth, to tiptoe around positions of authority as a means to avoid threat, harassment, or something even worse, death. The Hate U Give absorbs and explores the aura that seems to feast our contemporary discussions and issues, while doing so through a dramatic stroke, that aims to speak, connect, and inspire us.",The Hate U Give
49,treakle_1978,This is Crazy!!,10,11 July 2020,This movie is Crazy. After watching it I have mixed emotions. Very powerful message and performances especially by Amandla Stenberg!!,The Hate U Give
50,asifahsankhan,Very worthwhile film,8,8 December 2018,"A stunning performance by the unstoppable Amandla Stenberg alone justifies the film's existence as a smart kid in a troubled African-American neighbourhood. Her dad (Russell Hornsby) has cleaned up his act after a spell in prison and set to running a successful local store. Her mom (the consistently excellent Regina Hall) remains a pillar of strength while pressures surge on all sides.Talking us through an uncomfortable choice, Starr tell us that the local high school ""is where you go to get jumped, high or pregnant"". With that in mind, her parents have paid to send her to a posh private school that - though nominally inclusive - only allows less threatening manifestations of diversity. This allows Starr a decent education. It also allows investigation of the questions mentioned above.The tensions come to a head when cops stop Starr and an old pal from the hood while the pair are driving home from a party. It says something about the current American condition that - as with similar scenes in Get Out and Widows - we immediately feel for the safety of the passengers. Prevailing culture layers the sequence with an inherent tension. Things go badly and Starr's world implodes.There has already been a lot of debate around The Hate U Give - its title derived from Tupac - but nobody sane has been questioning Stenberg's contribution. The young actor has the gift of spreading warmth wherever she goes, and her intelligence shines through in every scene.Stenberg also has the ability to listen convincingly. It sounds like a small thing, but it is important in a film so fraught with debate.The Hate U Give clocks in at well over two hours, but there is so much going on that it never drags. There's humour mixed in with the tragedy. There's reason mixed in with the rage - perhaps too much reason for some. Though the film is charged with anger, it skews towards compromise and strives for balance. The first ending stirs the blood. The second spreads a slightly sickly balm across the narrative.Very worthwhile, for all that.",The Hate U Give
51,bastos,Well made but preaching to the choir,7,2 January 2021,"This is an incredibly topical movie that addresses some very important social and racial issues that plague the American society. My problem here is that everything in this movie is so black and white (pun intended) that it loses its connection with the real world and helps perpetuate some stereotypes that aren't helpful for anybody. Now, I don't pretend to have the solution for these issues but I also am not sure that these kind of movies have them either. By making everything so morally easy doesn't help educate people that are faced with much more ambiguous challenges in real life and, for me, if they had made the movie more morally challenging it would make for a much more interesting and nuanced story. For example, my favorite scene in the movie is the short dialogue between Starr and her uncle when he gives her the cops point of view on the whole situation, but even that scene ends with a morally easy way out. I think this story needed more of those kind of scenes, where they would explore the ambiguity of the real world, and then, even if ambiguous, build an ethical point of view to try and do the correct thing and thus spreading your message through much harder scrutiny. On a technical note I think the movie is really well made and Amandla Stenberg was a revelation for me, as they needed someone who could carry the movie and she does a tremendous job, conveying charisma, strength and kindness, a very large emotional range for such a young actress. All in all I do think this is a good movie, even if it's preaching to the choir, that needed a bit more grey in a whole lot of black and white.",The Hate U Give
52,skpn123,Such important messages for our teens to receive,8,11 November 2018,"I can't believe anyone could give this film a low rating for the right reasons. It deals with very intense issues yet it is gentle and nuanced where it is possible to be so and describes a teenager divided between two worlds, two communities, and most importantly, two separate identities. These divides leave her feeling helpless and uncertain.The growth of the main character through difficult events (and the growth or stagnation of those around her) allow her to transcend this confusion and find her voice.This movie also portrays the power of community to broker change when all members stop being afraid and pull together for the common good.All these are very worthy themes for ourselves and our children to consider. Myself, it took me back to when I was pregnant with my third child in Los Angeles and I did a wonderful dance class. Trouble was, about every second week the class was late starting because he was randomly pulled over and interrogated under racial profiling policies. We were all disgusted and annoyed that our teacher who was gentle and creative was treated in this fashion yet we did nothing...... Shame on us......",The Hate U Give

55,ccorral419,"This worthy film may come and go, so keep an eye out for a screening",10,24 October 2018,"The Hate U Give (THUG). Director George Tillman Jr., ""Notorious"" for presenting honest films that look at life from and/or about the disadvantage, brings a must see Indie film about a young African-American girl Starr (Amandla Sternberg (""Everything, Everything""), who must find her voice. Living in Garden Heights (a factious location, but could be anywhere), her protective mother Lisa (Regina Hall ""Girls Trip"") and proud yet cautiously strict father Russell Hornsby (""Fences"") transfers Starr and brother Seven (Lamar Johnson ""Kings"") to an all white school across town. Through thought provoking VoiceOver, Starr guides the audience through the two lifestyles she walks among. It isn't until she is an eye witnesses to a police slaying, that she must decide to speak up or stay in the background. Tillman Jr. knows how to let the camera experience a situation and envirnoment, without any unnecessary special effects or busy camera work, thus giving the production a constant feeling that the film is done on a low budget. Yet, it's this same feeling that gives the film its legitimacy. Carrying the picture, with much heart and honesty, is young Amanda Sternberg, who's beautiful performance draws you into her world. With this film under her belt, she is officially on the ""Rising Star"" radar. Kudos to Anthony Mackies (""The Hurt Locker"") for nailing his ""King"" lord role, Common (rapper turned actor) for his Uncle / Cop performance and monologue, Issa Rae (""Insecure"") for her ""Justice for Justice"" role, and all the youth actors for their honest performances. With the ""Black Lives Matters"" movement, racial profiling and society divided at an all time high, this film is current and should resonate. Screenplay by Audrey Wells, based on the novel by Angie Thomas, creates the families home life that cements all the action presented on the screen. I'd ""Hate"" for ""U"" to miss this one, so keep an eye out for a screening, as the film may come and go quickly.",The Hate U Give
56,PotassiumMan,Potent tale of racial injustice in America,8,10 November 2018,"This film portrays the story of a black teenage girl, Starr Carter, who lives in two worlds, the desperately poor neighborhood where her family lives and the overwhelmingly white private school she attends. She has friends at school and close friends from her childhood, but her delicate balance between these two spheres is shattered when she witnesses the police shooting of a lifelong friend. From there on, her choices become harder.Naturally, this is a hard-hitting tale of the struggle of social justice in the face of institutional racism and tensions within the black community between law-abiding citizens and criminal gangs. I thought at first the characters were a bit broadly drawn, but as the film progressed they became more defined. The people who struggle to survive in the ghetto have dueling adversaries, the racist police on the one hand and the powerful criminal element on the other. That's the struggle that is portrayed and it's done quite well. Unfortunately for Starr, there is the added burden of fitting into her world at school at the expense of staying true to her hard-earned principles.Unapologetic and eloquent to the nth degree, this is a great film about understanding race relations among those who are often heard the least. This will leave a mark on anyone who has woken up. Strongly recommended.",The Hate U Give

If you have a clue about real life, it isn't.",The Hate U Give
59,TheMovieDoctorful,"Finally, A Film Worthy Of Amandla Stenberg's Talents",10,20 October 2018,"Poor Amandla Stenberg. She's a great actress who consistently appears in bad movies. Columbiana, The Hunger Games, Rio 2, Everything Everything...At least The Darkest Minds was entertainingly awful. She's been the best thing in every movie she's appeared in and it's been beyond frustrating to see her waste her time in terrible movies that aren't worthy of her talents as an actress. The Hate U Give remedies that problem. Not only is it a good film, it's one of the best films of the year; as a Diablo Cody-esque Young Adult comedy, it works. As a commentary on race relations, it works. As a character study about mourning and teenage self identity, it works. And as a platform to showcase Stenberg's considerable skills as an actress, it works with flying colors.The acting, as predicted, is phenomenal. Stenberg gives one of the best performances of the year as Starr Carter, a bright and shy private school student going through a massive change of heart following the murder of her close friend and crush, Khalil. Her delivery and facial acting have such an incredible conviction and energy to them and she more than delivers in the more emotional and powerful scenes of the film. Whether she's crying at the coffin of a loved one, unleashing her righteous fury on a racist former friend or rallying the masses with a moving speech, Stenberg tears up the screen. Both emotionally vulnerable and relatable while carrying an exceptional amount of charisma and heroism in her performance, Stenberg's portrayal of Starr makes for a heroine who is impossible not to be inspired and moved by.I haven't seen Russell Hornsby in any film or TV show prior to The Hate U Give, but his acting here makes me morbidly curious to check out his other work. If Stenberg's acting wasn't as spectacular as it was, Hornsby easily stolen the show as Maverick Carter, Starr's idealistic and passionate father. Hornsby is funny, rousing, powerful and deeply human, sometimes all at once. This is an Academy Award worthy performance, no question, and this is an actor who desperately needs more workI had very mixed feelings towards KJ Apa as an actor from Riverdale, but his performance as Chris has completely redeemed him in my eyes. He's sympathetic, nuanced and affably dorky. Apparently, Stenberg isn't the only great actor burdened with an unfortunate filmography.It definitely helps this underdog cast that they're playing much more interesting, relatable and likable characters than they're usually given. Starr's character development is among the finest I've seen in a coming-of-age film, right up there with Jim Stark in Rebel Without A Cause and Sam Monroe in the criminally underrated Life as a House. You can really feel her increasing insecurity, paranoia and inner torment as societal pressures from both the black world and the white world increasingly come down on her. Watching her grow from a diplomatic bystander into an uncontrollable, impassioned and furious force of righteous change and racial retribution is incredibly satisfying, especially given the emotional roller coaster this film took me down with her character. I cried with Starr, I laughed with Starr and I even found myself silently wishing I could cheer and shout with Starr as she raises up the people around her and brutally silences her critics. Marverick Carter's arc is handled beautifully as well, beginning the film as an old school ""Black Panther"" type, growing into a more over-protective and sheltering father and finally returning back to threshold as the incredible hero whom he always desired to be (And who his children saw him as) in the 3rd act of the film.One of my favorite aspects about The Hate U Give is how it seamlessly balances so many different genres. The witty, creative use of teenage slang and perfect comedic timing give it weight as a Young Adult comedy, the nuanced, unpredictable and original way that it tackles race and race relations (I was beyond impressed by how little narrative cliches this movie uses) give it weight as a racial commentary and Stenberg's harrowing and heartbreaking journey of grief and self reflection give it weight as a character study. None of these genres overpowers the other tonally or thematically, it's a seamless blending and it works beautifully. The film is cohesive and consistent in its tone, which is a rare compliment for a modern Hollywood theatrical release.Praise must also be given to the directing of this film, which I feel may get overlooked with everything else the film does right. George Tillman Jr. does a rather brilliant job lingering on symbolic iconography associated with Civil Rights movements more and more over the course of the film; hoodies, hairbrushes, megaphones, e.t.c. However, these images go by quickly and at an odd angle, so the effect is subliminal rather than clumsy and manipulative. This is visual symbolism at its finest and it just goes to show that, like the best filmmakers, Tillman Jr. has an unquestionable understanding for the importance of visuals over dialogue in the medium of film (Not that the dialogue isn't, as previously described, often witty, funny and clever.)The Hate U Give is an amazing film and you need to see it right now. So many films these days based on race come across as exploitative, cliched and generic, but this one delivers in all of the ways those films don't. It's sincere, it's original, it's unpredictable and it has genuine heart behind it. And it's the first good movie in Amandla Stenberg's filmography! How about that?",The Hate U Give

63,cappiethadog,Being black,7,15 May 2019,"Starr and her two younger brothers were preteens when daddy gave them ""the talk"". Mama(Regina King) was there, too, but Maverick Carter(Russell Hornsby), an ex-drug runner for the King Lords, a gang that covers every inch of Garden Heights, did all the lecturing. This is the talk all black children receive; the talk about the blue and white. It's a survival lesson in the event should a policeman pull them over, and being black, make no mistake about it, they will be pulled over, justifiably or unjustifiably so, at some juncture in their lives, arbitrarily. Starr Carter(Amanda Stenburg), seven years later, will be sixteen, the lone black girl attending a prep school for privileged white kids. It's as if she has a doppleganger; white her. Starr separates white her from black her. In spite of all that compartmentalizing, she never forgets who is the original and who is the copy. Inevitably, her double life gets exposed after a policeman guns down her childhood friend during a routine traffic stop. The cop points the gun at her, too. She doesn't look like a junior that attends an out-of-district high school. Only white girls go to the good school. The police officer profiles Starr, figuring she must be one of three things; a potential second shooter, a drug dealer's moll, or a drug dealer's moll high on her boyfriend's product. But most important of all, he sees a ***** straight outta Garden Heights. Starr follows the officer's instructions. On asphalt, Starr lies down flat, so the law and order man can handcuff her. Khalil(Algee Smith) never got the talk. He should have stopped by the house that day; pull up a chair like the other Carter kids, pretend that the kitchen table was a dashboard, and practice the act of unconditional surrender with bowed head and open hands spread out in a V formation. Don't give the officer a reason to pull out his gun. Khalil breaks Maverick's golden rule. While Khalil talks to Starr through the driver's side window, he reaches into the car for his hairbrush. Bullets discharge from a gun. A crime has just been committed. Starr leaves the car. Rules were meant to be broken. But it's the two black teenagers who are guilty. Cop 115(Drew Starkey) knew it the moment he laid eyes on them.""The Hate U Give"", directed by George Tillman, addresses the politics of being black and being white, and furthermore, who gets to act black; black people or white people. Code-switching is the price Starr pays to attend Williamson. The high school in Garden Heights is where you get ""jumped, high, pregnant, or killed"". In the suburbs, Starr is ""Version 2"", which means no ""ghetto"" signifiers, starting with the hoodie she removes before entering Williamson's hallowed glass doors. She stuffs the offending article of clothing, Starr Version 1's true identity, into her backpack. Starr is still that little girl at the table who remembers her daddy telling her that ""being black is a honor"". It takes up a lot of space, but she finds room. Every day, Starr reenacts the transformation from Kara Danvers into Supergirl, but there is no S-Shield under that jacket. The school uniform makes her weak. Starr Version 1 gives ""stank eyes"" and yells. It's more like a straitjacket than a cape. The hoodie is a reminder that she ""comes from greatness""; not Krypton, but a real place, Africa, the cradle of civilization. Version 1 is always in control of Version 2. Nobody else is ""flipping a switch"" in her brain; it's her own finger turning the achromatic incandescence on, not some country singer or indie rock band. At the cafeteria, a male student cut in front of the lunch line; she's the next person to pay the cashier, but the girl from Garden Heights can't give him stank eyes or yell. She has to acquiesce and let him pay without protestation. The latent racism that occasionally escapes from the high school student body is her kryptonite. In this topsy-turvy ecosystem of matriculation, the white students act blacker than Starr. Her classmates she passes in the hall employ hip-hop slang with such an unconscious familiarity and ease, it's as if the IPhone is a portal, in which white privilege enters the body musically through ear buds.The portal in ""Being John Malkovich"" is a small door that Craig Schwartz(John Cusack) discovers behind a filing cabinet at his workplace. Instead of a persona shaped by canned music journeying from the IPhone to one of Starr's classmates through a cord, Craig, a struggling puppeteer, and his partner Maxine(Catherine Keener) charge people to be the famous Hollywood actor. Instead of a consciousness, it's the corporeal self that travels through an umbilical-like cave, large enough to fit a body, which changes Malkovich's personality, similar to how it alters two of Starr's closest confidantes that she rendezvouses with in her second world. Starr Carter dates a white boy. His name is Chris(K.J. Apa), who has the saving grace of self-awareness while he's being black. The imitation makes her laugh, rather than cringe stoically. She quips: ""He swears he's D.J. Khaled."" Chris makes beats for her. When he shows off for Starr, dancing like a black man in the school hallway, it's reminiscent of ""Craig's Dance of Despair"" that he performs for Maxine as the puppeteer of his own puppet, once he takes up full-time residence in John Malkovich's body. Although Chris co-opts black culture, he doesn't attempt to identify with being black like some of his classmates. There is a distanciation that Starr appreciates. Chris knows who he is, white; knows that he is the puppet and D.J. Khaled is the puppet master. Craig, similarly, can control the Steppenwolf Theater Company alumnus, but he also has the mastery to let go of the bridle when he has to be his natural self. Starr's boyfriend knows how to work the strings on his white privilege. But the thing about Chris is that he doesn't need any strings, that's why Starr likes him; he doesn't need the jack plugged into his portal. ""This is just Chris,"" Starr states. Chris knows that he is not D.J. Khaled. Starr's boyfriend keeps his white privilege in check, but never forgets that he has it.Hailey(Sabrina Carpenter), Starr's BFF at Williamson, on the other hand, acts more like Lotte(Cameron Diaz), Craig's wife, who loves the idea of being in somebody else's skin. ""I was John ******' Malkovich,"" Lotte exclaims after discovering that being a man better suits the housewife, because it allows her to know Maxine on a personal level as the other, a male. ""The Hate U Give"" introduces Hailey as somebody who has viewed ""Straight Outta Compton"" one too many times. ""Let me at him, I'll kick his a**,"" are the first words out of her mouth. The self-styled homegirl from the suburbs doesn't know a thing about ""thug life"". This is just Hailey. ""You violent, girl,"" Starr teases. She lets it go. Hailey doesn't need to act like the other, black, but being black is how she chooses to forge their friendship to greater depths of closeness. That's how she differs from Lotte. Maxine only likes Craig's wife as Malkovich. ""You just say the word,"" Hailey tells her ""girl"" after learning about the incident that went down in the school cafeteria. Starr is not going to say the word. Not even Starr Version 1 would say the word. Starr is different. ""The Hate U Give"" is different. In another film, all the black people at a house party would be shown having fun, drinking and drugging, until a gun goes off. Starr doesn't do any of those things, but shots are fired, a trope in the ""black"" film that Hailey is no doubt familiar with. The party is where she reunites with Khalid, her first love, then says goodbye, on that lonely road beneath the unblinking moonlight.After Khalid's death, Hailey changes, or rather, Starr loses her quotation marks. Starr can see that Hailey really thinks she is Ice Cube. At gym class, Hailey says: ""Just pretend the ball is a piece of fried chicken,"" because they're N.W.A. and that's how Ice Cube talks to Dr. Dre. That's Ice Cube, not Hailey, telling Starr: ""Who else is going to stand up for our people, girl?"" when Williamson holds a ""Justice for Khalid"" rally instead of scheduled classes. In ""Get Out"", Jordan Peele's debut feature, a Spike Jonze film breaks out when Chris(Daniel Kaluuya) visits his white girlfriend's home for the first time. Peele, clearly influenced by ""Being John Malkovich"", visualizes what banishment to the subconscious would look like. Missy Armitage(Catherine Keener), the girlfriend's mom, hypnotizes Chris, who sinks into the chair, then through the chair, and into an abyss, staring all the while at the rectangle where life exists. Chris' destiny is to see life as gray matter through a white man's eyes in a state of passive existence. At the auction, Chris meets another black man, Rod(Lil Red Howery), who acts and sounds like an elderly white man, until he feels the flash from a cell phone camera which awakens Rod 1.0 from his occupation in the subconscious, and charges at the photographer, shouting, ""Get out! Get out!"" Star is just like Rod. The flashpoint for Starr Version 2 arrives when Hailey tells her that she's ""the non-threatening black"", which are coded words for ""white-like"". Khalil was a drug dealer, born to die, Hailey figures. One Starr folds into the other Starr. Daddy's big girl snatches Hailey's hairbrush from her purse and uses it as a mock weapon. ""Down on the ground,"" Starr shouts. But Starr is neither the threatening nor the non-threatening black. She is not the living embodiment of Tupac Shakur's words: The Hate U Give Little Infants **** Everybody.Starr is truly white now; the cop.And Hailey is truly black; her.",The Hate U Give

67,leftistcritic,A relevant film for our times,10,3 February 2019,"Recently there have been a number of films which have highlighted racism in the U$, like pro-cop Blackkklansman, Boots Riley's masterpiece, Sorry to Bother You, and recently released If Beale Street Could Talk. This film only did ok at the box office but that should not dissuade people from watching this film. It was interesting to see the main character, Starr, divided between her participation in the white world symbolized by the uppercrust private school she goes to and her home community. I also enjoyed the transformation of her from a witness of a horrible murder of her friend by a white police officer to an activist who was fighting for justice. While at the end the big drug lord goes to prison and community rebuilds from the riots, as Starr calls it, the social relations change little. So, in some ways this movie brings hope but in others I'm not completely sure what the takeaway should be. This differs from a movie like Sorry to Bother You that is optimistic about future struggles of workers against their masters. All in all, this movie was worthwhile, especially with a balanced focus on drugs/gangs in communities.There is so much more to say about this movie, however. I would add that this movie is interesting because of its depiction of crime within the Black community, as gangs have a strong hold on the community, with many involved in dealing drugs. In more radical speak, that would make them part of the ""lumpen"" as they would be involved in criminal activity, even though this is clearly and purely for their survival, as it should not held against them. I also liked the parts where the white schoolchildren at Starr's private school engaged in a Black Lives Matter protest not because they truly sympathized with the cause but rather because they wanted to get out of class, showing their absurd privilege in this case. As the protagonist, Starr bridges the white and black worlds, another sort of double-consciousness (idea of Starr Version 1 and Starr Version 2 as she puts it), echoing what W.E.B. DuBois wrote about in The Souls of Black Folk, embracing her black roots most of all by the end of the film. She also bridges this gap by liking what is undoubtedly a ""white thing"" by a white woman: the Harry Potter series, a series which has no prominent people of color from what I can remember. For those who wouldn't watch Sorry to Bother You, perhaps because it is too sci-fi for them and seems weird, this film can serve as a bit of a substitute to say the least.And with that, my review concludes, as I feel I accurately covered the bases of this film and analyzed it briefly to provide those interested with a look into the film itself in hopes that those who watch it see it.",The Hate U Give

Many movies in the genre would have religion as the subject, some would focus on other sociological topics. The Hate U Give is a lecture film about race relations. But don't get me wrong, it was done pretty well if not over the top here and there. I have given race relations a lot of thought over the years and the film made me want to explain my viewpoints to the film's makers (or at that moment, almost anyone), where they were right and where their views went awry. If The Hate U Give were a poorly-made movie I would not have had that urge. So it passed that litmus test and despite it being a lecture film, gets a thumbs-up from me.",The Hate U Give
71,AlbertCinefilu,"''I've got colour on the inside, where it counts''",9,21 February 2021,"And only if we could all think like Chris and put emphasis on the colour inside, instead of creating boundaries through the colour outside...Having read the eponymous novel by Angie Thomas this week, I guarantee you that the movie is almost as painfully powerful as the book, with a new surprising flavor in the end that I'm not going to spoil. It's about a black girl who witnesses the murder of her childhood friend when they are pulled over by a white officer one night. She has to find her voice and the courage to fight for society's acknowledgement of the truth behind that horrific event. She has to find the courage to stand against INJUSTICE, one of the most rotten terms in this world. INJUSTICE based on prejudice, prejudice based on colour and social class, two elements that people too often use as dividing mechanisms and hate mills.The effect this story has on you is ravaging. You feel enraged, infuriated, sad, you want so much your hope not to be in vain but somehow you are able to take part in the family's little joys. You are invested in the characters from the start and despite the fact that the story rarely lacks conflict, Starr's (the protagonist) family has pretty healthy dynamics, the two main sources of conflict being the outside world (school, the Lords of the local bands from her neighbourhood) and Starr's inner turmoil, identity crisis & indecision. Rarely do you have such a supportive family when you need it the most.Of course, there are some plot elements like the store Star grows up with or the relationship between her and her uncle, Carlos, that could have been bettered, but this might have added too much length and too little depth to the movie. The worst mistake is getting rid of DeVante, but I guess his role was partly replaced by Seven. There is also one semi-subtle hint in a scene that I really liked. After the trial at the Supreme Court, Starr is dressed entirely in white at school. Her mask is still there, she hasn't managed to reconcile her two identities yet - a black girl from the Garden Heights neighbourhood and a girl studying at Williamson, a prestigious school for white kids. But then, in a hilariously saddening scene involving a hairbrush, she expresses herself and thus reveals her true identity.In the end, ''The Hate U Give'' is one of those brilliant movies that successfully raises awareness to a particular problem in society, all while making your heart and soul slowly crumble.A 9,60 out of 10 from me.",The Hate U Give

We actually had a stellar movie that couldn't live up to it's name due to the shotcoming of the lead actor not being up to par in this one. I was so reluctant to watch this as it seemed like one of those heavy/deep movies that may be too emotional for comfort yet it wasnt.

I had only seen her in the flick; ""Colombiana"" which I liked and she was good in the role. I also saw her in the flick ""Everything-Everything"" which I also liked her in that role as. Yes, I am fan on young actress, Amandla. You go girl. I see an Oscar award in your future.However in this film based on real life racist Caucasian police killing African American men in various cities in this racial mixed melting pot. She really stands out in a great role with a great performance. I also liked the performance of actors Russell Hornsby as the dad, actor, K.J Apa as her good hearted and supported White boyfriend and actress,Regina Hall does a stand out performance as the mom. I do love to see mixed race couples who knows that true love does Not see skin color. When her father plays the race issue by pointing out that her boyfriend is white; ""The is your White boyfriend, Chris. She says; ""This is my boyfriend, Chris."" Great line. It reminds me of one of my favorite Interracial classic Love stories; ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" starring Spencer Tracey, Kat Hepburn and the great Sidney Poitier. Sidney told his father, ""you see yourself a Black man. I see myself as a man."" She nor Chris is seeing skin color. That is the way, God created all races and skin colors. God (Adonai, Elohim) and Jesus (Yeshua) does NOT see skin color. God only sees the heart and mind.Regina has come a long way from her supporting role as a stripper in ""The Best Man"" and her previous role in ""Love and Basketball as Sanaa Lathan's sister.

81,sherylchilders82,"Great movie, misses a big point on racism",7,15 August 2020,"The whole entire movie is awesome, including how you can really understand the rage of the main character. I'm not a fan of the religious points, but it was not in your face or offensive in any way to someone who is not religious.This is a story about racial unrest, from the point of view of a younger woman, which makes it unique and worth watching. Stenberg is fantastic at delivering the emotional message. You feel her pain and understand her actions, especially as a young woman still coming into her own identity. At first, we see a relatively privileged girl who witnesses something horrifying. Then, we learn that this isn't her first tragedy, and the façade unravels. I have no doubt that this theme is more deeply explored in the book (perhaps also with the belief systems of her father), as finding your identity as a coming-of-age black girl must be extremely challenging, especially in this age of unrest we live in now where everything is so open and raw. Growth is painful, for individuals, and for society.I understand the desire to preserve black communities, which is why I still liked this movie. But, it sort of ends like they're just supposed to will themselves out of poverty and crime, which I vehemently disagree with. The very definition of oppression is that the vulnerable are made weaker by exploitation by the privileged, not by other vulnerable people (who happen to be criminals). It perpetuates the idea that the real enemy is the gangs and not systemic racism. Maybe the writer is trying to say that personal responsibility is important, and of course it is, but it doesn't really solve the problem. In real life, that gang leader would only be replaced by another one, because there is still a void in that community. And that void is ultimately caused by economic oppression and systemic racism. And as depressing as that is, no one can just will that away.And in that sense, even if it gives a positive message, which I think has great value in itself it does a disservice. I'd like to see little Starr go on to study law and represent her district in congress. Perhaps we can invest more in public education, especially in communities with more brown kids, so they can go back and build their own businesses that earn their community more wealth, if they choose. Or force private schools to be AS diverse as the public schools. Maybe this is ultimately what the author had in mind, but it just felt a little too glossy for me. But, then again, it was nice to have such a topic addressed in a positive light, rather than being gloomy and depressing. So, still a great movie.",The Hate U Give

The acting was pretty good in addition to Stenbergs performance, and for a 2 hour plus movie it seemed to fly by.

83,cinemawithcj,The Hate U Give - Cinema with CJ Review,6,1 December 2018,"The Hate U Give is a flick that rides the line between being good and great. There is no doubt that it is tone perfect and evergreen in theme, but at the same time, for a good chunk of the film it doesn't quite leap at you.It is strong and powerful, but it's a bit on the nose. The Hate U Give echos reality, and whether it's a work of fiction or not, it feels like a story that definitely exists for real in this world.Which is where the film shines. There are many a scene that sucker punches you, and makes you realise that this is the way people are, and there's good and bad. There's one particular scene that wonderfully illustrates how those who say they care on the outside of the truth of it all don't really get it at all. The sympathisers that still don't quite realise that there's more to the problems with race and society than just a hashtag.The Hate U Give captures you from the beginning, showing how from a young age, kids in the world of the movie - and that world in real life - have to know that this is how things are, and those things are sh-ty. It's f-ed up that they have to truly follow instructions to the letter to stay alive in this world.The themes are strong. They resonate, they open eyes, they don't back away from the fact that this is how it is. And we need change.As an overall film, though, it doesn't light a fire as well as it could. Maybe it's the pacing, maybe it's the acting, there's just some missing link in The Hate U Give, which is disappointing. It pleasantly surprises coming off the trailer, but it does still feel like a young adult version of a really great film, and instead it's just a really good film.",The Hate U Give

However, there were many conflicts between characters that were left unresolved at the end of the film, there were some stylistic choices in the way that it was shot that I didn't like, and it also moved kind of slow, which I can handle a slow film, but I feel like it needed to pick up the pace a bit more. The exposition though is pretty good, it's after the 45 minute mark where it starts to slow. There were also some minor issues I had, just a few moments and some throwaway lines.

I thought this would be one of those overly pretentious movies, but turns out, it wasn't!Here we have a film that tackles racism in America. All this film does, is hold a mirror to society and depict the systemic racism especially in America! An important film with a lot of depth, heart and soul! Pure emotions!This is a great example of fantastic directing and acting. Yes, the script is decent, but it isn't revolutionary. This film was all about execution! The directing and acting are what make this movie so gripping, heartbreaking and moving!Can we just talk about the cast in this film? Amandla Stenberg, Regina Hall, Russell Hornsby, Anthony Mackie, Common, Sabrina Carpenter and so many others who all deliver phenomenal performances! This is a well functioning cast with great chemistry!'The Hate U Give' is a timeless film dealing with a subject matter that's still very present today and unfortunately will still be in the future.
The weakest part of this film is the relationship between our protagonist and her boyfriend who I didn't care all that much for. It wasn't bad, but I thought that was the least interesting part of the film.
Other than that, this is a pretty spot-on portrayal of the life in the ""hood""!
Even though the film has multiple antagonists, it never feels convoluted. The storytelling is just so organic and it's very fluent! On paper, the film shouldn't even be that good, but somehow it managed to break through the boundaries by simply holding a mirror to society!Overall, 'The Hate U Give' is a great portrayal about the struggles African Americans have to go through on a daily basis!

We were spoon fed, and at times it had the feel of an after school special. From the writing, to the performances, to the music, everything was very literal. There was no subtext or anything to read into. Maybe the filmmakers accomplished exactly what they were going for. The overall style was consistent throughout and it seemed that the artists behind this mostly hit their mark. For my money, however, I prefer an approach that is more challenging.

The main criticism one can level at it is that the movie does not present a well-rounded set of viewpoints. ""Crash"" for example did a better job at being more even-handed.

Sure there are. Are they depicted in this movie? Not really. Those good cops carry a double burden: first is doing an inherently hard and dangerous job; second they have to live with the bully image that the other 80% of the cops create for them not only through high profile cases, but also day in and day out during routine interactions with the rest of us.

It's the kind of movie that you don't want to see again because it's so painful to watch, but it's also the kind of movie you have to look at again because it's message resonates powerfully and poignantly. The Hate U Give isn't a film about another police shooting of another unarmed black male. That's a component of it. If anything The Hate U Give is a 2-hour therapy session on coping with the realities of our world and how people of color across the nation strive for justice in an unjust system. It's the therapy session we all needed but were afraid to attend.The story is simple to follow yet sophisticated enough to ignite a firestorm of events. Starr Carter (Amandla Stenberg) attends a party where her childhood best friend Khalil (Algee Smith) is killed during a traffic stop by a white police officer on their way home from the party. Pressures from the media, the community, and activists try to force Starr to tell her truth, while the local gang lord-King (Anthony Mackie) demands her silence. This is just one world she lives. Prep school white kids surround her other life-Starr version 2.0-and she feels the pressure of hiding the truth about her community, who she is as a black woman, and her struggles against polite racism. All of this weight is on the shoulders of a child, and you're never allowed to forget that. Amandla Stenberg's performance truly shines in this respect-conveying the gravity of the situation.The 23-year old actress immerses you into this teenaged character. She doesn't traverse the world with an unnatural level of confidence-Amandla makes Starr come off as a kind, level-headed kid, who doesn't feel like she fits into either world which she lives. She's insecure but tries to exude toughness because it's essential for her survival. Moreover, in the end, she's forced to mature fast to stand up to an adult class that refuses to hear her voice. Amandla takes you on this emotional and intellectual evolution in a way that you can embrace her good and bad decisions and respect the power of her commitment to change. Amandla Stenberg's ability to convey emotion without words is the reason you'll find yourself in tears repeatedly in this film as she tries to process her pain. She is our avatar in a world of injustice, and we feel what she feels.I remember all the negativity that surrounded the casting of Amandla Stenberg as the protagonist-Starr (over her skin color) and the controversy surrounding one of the white leads being replaced for racists slurs he made on YouTube. It seemed like the film was headed for disaster before it was even launched. However, this film was too important to be derailed by social media pettiness and one actor's racist rant. So I'm glad none of that stopped the production of George Tillman Jr.'s best film since Soul Food. Tilman is an unappreciated auteur that deserves an introspective look into his filmmaking abilities. Tillman has a gift for telling stories about people of color in a way that's honest, respectful, and thought-provoking. There's a slight tendency in his film to get preachy, but it's never to this films detriment. If anything it's a part of this film strength. The Hate U Give is a must see for all communities. This is a film about what makes us human and why the fight for justice requires courage and conviction.",The Hate U Give
107,ashleyryan-36896,Superb.,10,10 February 2019,"Definitely got the message across as it shows both sides. It doesnt have a strong narrating factor either, like someone somehow thought it did. We are a white family in Texas and my kids wanted to watch it. I'm so glad they did, because we paused a lot to answer their questions. Unfortunately, a lot of the questions resulted in a ""but you're white so this probably wont ever happen to you"" response. We dont know what it's like to be black or targeted by police, so it was such an amazing view of it. We cried a lot. Its honest, heartbreaking, and so true to real life (at least from what we can tell).
Everyone definitely NEED to see this.",The Hate U Give
108,DanPH77,Had the potential to be one of the greats but fell short,7,23 October 2018,"I really wanted to give this movie a 9/10 but it didn't hit home on alot of points which were either unnoticed opportunities or intentional messages. The Hate U Give seems confused on rather it wants to promote racism or try to end it. The premise of the movie is a young ""black"" boy is killed be a ""white"" cop (feel free to remove the words in "" "" to understand the coming point) and this happened after a pull over for a very minor traffic violation. The cop asks for his ID and the boy doesnt want to cooperate and is being hard to get along with. The cop then tells the boy to get out of the vehicle and put his hands on the roof of the car and stay in the position while he runs his ID...(later in the movie this is even addressed by Starr's ""black"" uncle that they do this for the PROTECTION of the INDIVIDUAL and the OFFICER. They are in a HIGH CRIME area where there are alot of GUN SHOOTINGS and it was NIGHT. Anyway, if that wasnt clear enough...the boy reached in the vehicle and the officer assumed he was pulling a gun and thought he saw a gun in his hand (it happened to be just a black hairbrush). BE MINDFUL, this was AT NIGHT in a HIGH CRIME AREA where an officer cannot fully discern between a black object rather it may or may not be a gun...what is understood is that it could be a gun and the OFFICER'S life could be in danger. This is taught in law enforcement quite well that if you dont act appropriately you could die...this happens all the time...and its not ""racism"". I have seen plenty of footage of a ""white"" officer pulling over a ""black"" man and being very kind with him and then the ""black"" man jumping out and shooting him after the officer hesitated to shoot because he didnt want to shoot but it cost him his life. Anyway, the uncle was then asked by Starr what would he do if it was a white man instead of the young black boy. He responded and said he would tell him to put his hands up....this is the first point they failed on instead of just saying it doesn't matter the race they are trained in a situation and act accordingly the same every time. Another point in the movie Starr's friend says the officers life matters to and Starr got angry with her and insinuated she was a racist...really? Do all lifes no matter? It is kind of sad the movie rather perpetuate racism instead of show points that could end it if we all work together...if you stand there and point your finger how will you ever be able to solve the issue.In the end there is a point where Starr has an internal monologue relating to the racism issue (and I start thinking to myself its not The Hate U Give it should be called The Hate WE Give because its pointing the finger acting like its one sides fault when everyone is at fault because we are not working together to fix the issue only causing strife and divide) and right after I thought that she says ""its not The Hate U Give its The Hate WE Give""I was surprised with this and though ok the movie is going to end well with a great message...and it just fell short because she never told her friend she was sorry for acting like she did and basically that girl was left in the movie as a racist outcast when she was not.Overall the movie had good acting and was entertaining and like I said had the chance to be one of those movies remembered for decades but it got cold feet and never went for the homerun; shame. Its sad that either knowingly or subliminally those who created this film rather perpetuate racism than end it with a great message with no pointing fingers.",The Hate U Give

If this movie would have clearly decided to tell a one sided story (or a one sided narrative for a ""finger point"" in movie form), it would have absolutely put me off from it. However, I feel like it didn't. It paints a picture of an unfortunate reality in a realistic way.I'm finding it hard to put such a complicated topic into simplified statement, but - as it is an imdb movie review, I'll do it anyway;
It made me understand better how something like this must FEEL. When I often try to think it through, I know how messed up the scenarios can be, but it's hard to.. ""feel"" how it could be. (I do not kid myself to think I 100% know now however.) But the amazing role from Amandla Stenberg especially and actually the whole cast, it was very easy to relate to and imagine how easy it would be to become enraged in search of justice... and rightly so.But the movie takes it's time to look deeper. I don't want to say any more, to not spell out anything, but absolutely want to encourage anyone to watch it throughout, with open eyes.Very positively surprised and certainly left me with a whole lot to think about and (I'd like to think) a better understanding/mindset, than any sort of news about such topics from across the world.Lets hope in time the cycle would in deed break.

121,beckett_ivy,The book was so much better.,7,4 December 2020,"First off, the book was way better. It provides way more detail than the movie did, and I feel you should read the book first, gather way more information then the movies gives, and then watch the movie.
This was a good movie, but I feel the editing was a little choppy and was quite basic. Amandla Stenberg absolutely slayed the roll though. She did an amazing job, and I haven't watched a movie with her in it that I didn't like. She's incredible.
The movie didn't provide as much detail as the book, as I said above, so people did get more of the Black Lives Matter side out of the movie. You hear more from a black and a white cop in the book, so it was well done, giving two sides.
All in all, the movie was good, but the book was way better. I highly recommend that you read the book before you watch the movie.",The Hate U Give
122,sessedup,Could not stop crying,5,8 November 2018,"I used a whole pack of tissues. There were many moving scenes, with the story trying to balance the devastating with the lighthearted. The main characters were flawed and very righteous.
But there were a lot of flat characters: Seven, Starr's best friends (except for the poster child for white privileged racism), her bf, and the drug kingpin, the catalyst for the B story. I was not really impressed with the movie as a piece of art, though the soundtrack and sneakers were pretty dope. Some scenes were clunky and the dialogue unrealistic, not to mention its bloated runtime (whatever happened to the 80-min movie standard??).But overall I thought the story line and Stenberg's acting were emotionally engaging. I really got her character's internal struggle, and was invested in her perspective. There were a lot of nuances and just as many blurred lines. For example, Starr's father has the kids recite the Black Panther bill of rights verbatim, which her mother was presumably on board with. But later in the movie, the father completely betrays his wife's wishes and heads straight into a dangerous situation with their son, to confront a drug lord. You didn't really get a sense of the consequences of this breach of trust on their marriage. That's some real stuff. But it was absent from the narrative I think because the movie tried to deal with so many issues (as you can read in other reviews). The result is heart wrenching but ultimately surface-level. Glad I watched it!",The Hate U Give

It's technically fine, the acting is fine, the topicality is fine. Young adult fiction at it's most fine.It lacks nuance, it defines it's characters as very broad caricatures, and has a surprisingly low amount of empathy for any character that doesn't fit neatly in the ""good"" box.This is the first recent movie that I noticed how heavy handed direction can actually turn into audience manipulation rather than narrative enhancement. For instance, all of the scenes with white characters are shot in cold, sterile filters whereas all scenes with minority characters (even Common playing the ""bad"" cop uncle) are shot with warm tones and soft lighting. It seems there is a not so subtle agenda being pursued there by the director that falls well outside the main character's story arc.What it does well is show the confusion of being trapped between two worlds. Being two people in one body, two parts of the same whole. Ultimately it's about how when those parts come into conflict, how do we decide what makes us who we are versus who we're expected to be. That's about as high concept as YA fiction gets so that's as high as our expectations should be set.All fine.",The Hate U Give

The performances were delivered so well, espically from the lead actress, really felt like a character that you could relate too. The way how the social commentary played out was inspiring and empowering. The script is fine but of course nothing outstanding, it's the story from Angie Thomas, the performances and direction from the director. I disliked the way certain characters were shown and I didn't really favour the ending too much but either way, this film is really underrated by audiences. I wonder why...",The Hate U Give
141,Random3,The film kept catching me out with how it was willing to do the opposite of what I expected.,7,28 November 2018,"I was expecting this movie to be extremely biased and that it would spend the entire time shoving its agenda down my throat. Rather than being a one-dimensional rant on how cops should stop shooting black people, it was instead an interesting examination of one teenage girl and what she goes through after witnessing her friend get shot.The shooting scene itself was actually a lot less biased than I was expecting. The cop wasn't overtly racist, and his mistake was presuming that the black man he stopped was holding a gun rather than a hairbrush. And when he realised what he had done he acknowledged that he made a mistake. It was more of a subconscious, institutional prejudice rather than him just being a racist.The black man who was pulled over was also not presented as a flawless, totally innocent man. We know he is a drug dealer. We see him refuse to cooperate at least three times. When the cop tells him to stay with his hands on the car, he instead decides (stupidly) to reach into the car and grab a hairbrush. Because this is totally the time and place to brush your hair.So to summarise on that point, rather than simply having an innocent teenager being murdered by a racist cop, as so many other films would do, we actually see the teenager get shot due to his own lack of cooperation and idiocy. This I think is a far more realistic and less biased way to present something like this. A black cop explains this explicitly in a later scene, that if the victim had cooperated then this would have been avoided. The same black cop also states that he would have done the same in the same situation, adding that he would not have fired his weapon if the victim had been white. The film cleverly doesn't praise or condemn this, it just is what it is.There were black cops that were just as bad as the white cops. There were also both black and white cops that were presented as just doing their jobs. Starr's white boyfriend Chris explains why when he sees black people he doesn't see their colour, whereas Starr's father immediately sees Chris as a ""white boy"". A black cop explains why he would have done the same as the white cop when he shot the black teenager. The film kept catching me out with how it was willing to do the opposite of what I expected. And it made the film infinitely better by presenting multiple sides to a complicated issue, instead of treating its audience like idiots and preaching to the choir.__________Now, my problems with the film:The film literally opens with a black man telling his family how to behave when a cop inevitably pulls them over for no reason. Thankfully, the rest of the film wasn't quite this blunt.The soundtrack, at least for the first 40 minutes or so, was very distracting. Maybe it is beacuse I don't like or listen to ""trap-hop"" (if that is the correct name) but I also think it was excessive to have such a huge number of songs in such a short amount of time. Every minute or two they blast another song at you. As I enjoyed most of the rest of the film this is really a nitpick and probably is more down to my music taste than anything.The subplot with the gangsters was totally unnecessary. The main source of conflict in the second hour could have easily been avoided. Additionally, the gangsters didn't seem to want to kill Starr so much as mildly inconvenience her.There are some silly arguments between Starr and her white friend that were pretty pointless, especially given how good the other discussions in the film were.The ending was also very silly and didn't suit the rest of the movie. When dealing with a subject like this, having a happy ending rarely works. This is part of what made American History X so incredibly powerful. In The Hate U Give, the ending felt very artificial, almost like they changed their minds and reshot the last five minutes.
__________And a couple of other things to note:I found it interesting and, again, unexpected that the film showed how a peaceful protest can easily become violent.I found it quite brave and, again, unexpected for the film to show Starr being sickened by seeing white teenagers holding Black Lives Matter banners in a protest.I found it very amusing how the characters get held up in traffic due to a protest.The characters are consistent. Rather than existing to project the films agenda to the audience, they usually exist to present a certain viewpoint. The film does a very good job of exploring this.Overall, 7/10.",The Hate U Give

a book called ""The Hate U Give"" as a section to read hardcover by Amazon. Now l am 39 and last year in 2018 there was a movie adapted from the book called, ""The Hate U Give""., l decided to see at the movies in California were l have lived for years.The story about Starr Carter who lives with her parents, mother Lisa Carter, father Maverick Carter, and brothers Seven Carter, Sekani Carter.
Starr meanwhile, lives in a Garden Heights Neighborhood, and a student at
a white private school by the name of William Prep. She is dating Chris and he takes her to her Senior Prom in a black stretch limo. Chris is a popular boy at school. Also, Starr Carter is best friends with both Hailey Grant and Maya Yang. Futhermore, she grew up with Khalil Harris and saw his accidental death. It is a good movie as it shows scenes of Starr's bedroom, and a clip of her leaving for prom.",The Hate U Give

159,snknight-98010,Powerful yet so vulnerable.,9,14 September 2021,"I gave this movie a 9 stars rating only because I never give 10 stars no matter how great or powerful a movie is, 10 stars would imply ""perfection"" which is an impossibility as we're all fallible and therefore cannot create perfection in any way, shape or form as it is truly defined. The reason I gave this movie 9 stars are, the subject matter, the way it is portrayed and shown. This movie has truly my hamsters spinning and drew me in from start to finish. When I first started to watch the beginning, I almost changed channel because I felt it was just another movie that used ""racism"" as a reason to be. But I quickly changed my mind and was drawn in within the first few mins and in the end, was happy I did so. I wrote in the headline that it was ""Powerful and vulnerable"" at the same time. Meaning that it was powerful in showing the truth in our times and in the same instant, showing how vulnerable the black community is in regards to prejudice and all it entails. If I was to continue my critique of this movie, I'd end up writing a book long comment. So, I'll just say and encourage everyone/anyone to watch this movie as it is well worth your time. And I guaranty you, that it will leave you thinking on many many issues that you heard and witnessed from Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr and all others who tried to eradicate racism in their own way, from Abraham Lincoln and everyone else in between to this day.",The Hate U Give

I'd say the film has more value if viewed through the eyes of someone like its main character, or someone ignorant but open to learning.The biggest flaw in the film is its series of contrivances, beginning with the film's turning point. An unwarranted police killing following a sweet moment of humanity, followed by a theme that suggests all such situations are similar. Killed over a hairbrush? You wouldn't find much, if any, dissent. As current events are teaching us, even the most ardent police supporters can't defend every one of these killings.The white characters are largely not just ignorant, but actively racist. The black characters aren't just victims, they're entirely blameless. Police interactions aren't occasional and confrontational, they're constant and violent. The story's strength relies upon building from each of these pristine scenarios to deliver its emotional punch, but I don't think it needed to.I enjoyed it, despite its heavy-handedness in its delivery. Clearly meant for teens, but my main takeaway was that even these contrivances may in fact just be the perspective of the black community, and that's an important lens to view it through.",The Hate U Give

I feel this production succeeded in doing it without over-vilifying the officer, instead just letting that action remain in the background. We instead are enlightened on how a parent must have that talk with his children on how to react in the presence of an officer, how African American's may have some difficulty in a mostly white school setting and of course the living in a community where protest and being a ""snitch"" may have dire consequence.

The conflict that many of us in the black community face as we traverse different communities and spaces was also explored though Starr, who gave life and meaning to her character. The acting in this movie was top-notch. There was nothing lacking. I couldn't hold the tears back right throughout the film. Watching the scenes

181,michaelmangin,Overcoming Adversity and Heartbreak,8,2 August 2019,"I'm debating if I want to throw this on my list of favorite movies simply because of how thought provoking it is at times. Obviously, it is politically motivated and will anger a lot of people. There is no doubt there will be 1 star reviews. There are a lot of social messages being tackled in the film in one way or another, and they do tend to lean to the left. It can often be very frustrating watching a film such as this simply because it attempts to tackle complex issues that do not have quick solutions to. In fact, I can see how this film could raise racial tensions even further. Those who support ""Black Lives Matter"" and then those that support law enforcement.The writers did try to portray both sides of the story through Common's character ""Carlos."" I've enjoyed his roles in other movies, such as Wanted, Smoking Aces, John Wick Chapter 2, Hell on Wheels, and especially Street Kings. Did they get it right? I don't really think so, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt. He did have a scene where he was able to explain the perspective of a police officer at a traffic stop. This is a perspective film and it has some compelling and powerful moment, but doesn't leave much room for the audience to think for themselves.All around, I really enjoyed incorporating the thoughts of the late poet and writer Tupac Shakur as the very issues he spoke about are the very same issues we see to this day. I will leave all that be, however. I really enjoyed the acting, music, imagery, and story line. There is a great sense of loss and hopelessness at times. Gangs, crime, poverty, and drugs effect plenty of people's lives across America. It effects the cops on the streets and it effects the kids who have to grow up with it. Amandla Stenberg was great at showing that and portraying a leading a female role. She really carried this film.I never read the book, nor did I even know there was one until today, so I don't have much to compare it to. I really liked the way Starr's father named her the way he did and inspired her to be who she wanted to be and to especially rise up out of the streets. There were times, however, that I wasn't sure which direction the film was going and the ending probably could have been much better. There are certainly other flaws, but the strong emotional story of overcoming adversity sits well in my heart.",The Hate U Give
182,madaubosh,"Amazing, powerful acting. Disappointing script.",4,26 January 2019,"Listen, I know that adapting a book to a movie isn't an easy task. There's so much content. You need to trim it. Going in I was expecting that, but I was hopeful that the heart of the story would remain in tact. Some of the lessons stayed the same but in this case a picture was not worth a thousand words. This movie didn't do justice to the amazing book that came before it. The book was so much more powerful. The way she crafted it, the characters she made (some of which, namely Maverick, I feel like this movie ruined), the hurdles that Starr overcame really touched me. It was so powerful.The thing that really gets me is not what was cut, but what was changed. A small thing here and a small thing there but it was like death by a thousand paper cuts. Maybe if I hadn't read the book I would have liked this movie. Maybe if I didn't know that it could have been better I would have been raving. I can't say for sure. There was an important message this movie needed to share and I feel like this movie didn't come close to doing it justice in the way the book did. The removal of Devonte, the changes to Hailey's character, the injustice they did to both Maverick and April, even the things the changed about the murder or Khalil just added up to too much for me. I'm disappointed.In a nutshell, if you haven't read the book you may like this movie. I don't have a clear prospective. If you read the book and loved it as much as I do you may enjoy it but ready yourself for disappointment, just in case.",The Hate U Give

She did this by having two versions of herself: one for home, and one for school.But when her friend is killed, she has the additional problems of being ""the witness"" against the White police officer; and possibly ""the witness"" against the drug dealers her friend worked for. Let's just say that family issues make it even more complicated.The movie did an excellent job of walking the line between too sentimental and too angry.This movie just opened ""wide"" this weekend, and I strongly recommend that everyone go see it.

I am a white male from a poor but not impoverished back ground, I have not experienced any of the events in the film nor do I know anyone who has, but I felt as though I was living the life of the main protagonist.
The themes of unity and the situation of feeling like no one listens hit hard and the film worked wonderfully to illustrate how people at the bottom of the pile feel.

197,ryanmargetts-49051,Decent but fails in too many aspects.,5,23 October 2018,"To summarise this film I would say that it builds slowly and leads into nothing much. There are some powerful scenes in this film where I felt genuinely moved and concerned for the characters in the film but as a whole I found this film to be very stereotypical and misleading.Firstly, the way that the police are portrayed in this film suggest that every police officer is a Brutal racist with 0 empathy or compassion. I found it very distasteful on how it never showed the otherside of how these situations affect the police officer that is involved in a case like this. When this is brought up by a young white girl, she is seen to be the bad guy for suggesting that the cop and his family are also going through hell because of the shooting of the young black man.Another negative was how the entire film was about how black people matter and there lives matter but never about equality. Slight spoiler here. There is a scene where the young black girl that is the main character brings her boyfriend back to meet her father. The father proceeds to be rude and disrespectful to the young white boy for no other reason than because of his race. If this isn't racism then I don't know what is. This completely tantes anything the father says because we know that a small part of his motivations includes him being racist towards white people. This theme of misrepresenting white people was common throughout the film and I rather felt like I was watching a black lives matter propaganda film. Some parts genuinely infuriated me.Also a shorter negative here was how the film seemed to drag moments out that could be made much shorter and to the point which would have gave the film more pace and punch in delivering its message to the audience.Although there were many negatives I couldn't help but to become involved in the film and the characters. There were scenes that were moving. One of the final scenes where there is a riot on the street and starr (the main character) jumps up on the van and finally realised the power she has and finds her voice was very moving and made the hairs on my neck stand up. There were moments like this scattered through the film which is why I have rated this a 5 and not a 4.The film also delivered some occasional funny moments and one moment where the whole cinema erupted in laughter, although, some of the 'funny' parts were just so cringeworthy it hurt my skin.All in all this was a film that I will not see again due to its mediocreness and it's infuriating stereotyping.",The Hate U Give

So shooting was verified on the cop's side, but he could've shot on the leg is what I think.

I feel that a lot of reviews here are tainted with personal and extreme opinion about the Black and White issue and not a true review of the movie.The story is not at all one sided. A story has to be told from someone's point of view. Here, it is from a Black person's angle, which of course, necessitates the need to gravitate towards one race. However, the author cleverly chooses a Black girl, with a family heritage of drug pushing, brought up in a White environment, thereby diluting the race issue. As if not enough, the author melds other negative Black stereotypes into her story, such as a Black drug lord and a Black mule. With these, the story unfolds, showing both the good and bad characters of both the Black and White community. One of the most salient points raised is the question of whether the White traffic policeman is really wrong or not. It gave no answers.In addition, to sweeten the movie's ending, there is a nice scene that is clearly positive toward the White policemen in the last scene.All in all, I cannot see how the movie is one sided.

It is several subjects and points of view, more complex than a movie could really tackle, though. Even ""When They See Us"" had to be a miniseries to address a more specific event. For what this film is trying to do, with the movie time it has, it's almost perfect. There are some scenes that just don't hit with all the emotional impact obviously intended, feeling in those moments more like an after school special. I think it was using some shorthand to convey more complex ideas, like undercover racism.

214,iiviixiiviix,"The Hate U Give, A Film That Doesn't Make Me Hate Nor Love It",4,18 October 2018,"I will keep this very short. The Hate U Give is a sometimes nuanced film and sometimes teeters on being ""just okay"" with it's deliveries. The acting is very unbalanced, not saying all of the actors/actresses in this film don't give good performances at times. But, the best performance in the film comes from Russel Hornsby. Although, I am not sure if the writing his character received is just better (even if its just a little) makes his performance and character itself better than the others. Speaking of character, the mother character, played by Regina Hall, could have been utilized a lot more. Regina Hall is an excellent actress when presented the chance and I am kinda bummed out she didn't get to shine more.Like I said, I will try to keep this short. A lot of the character moments and dialogue felt forced or poorly portrayed, they often felt corny to me and made me giggle a bit.In shorter short (to keep it short like I said): Dialogue can be cringe worthy at time and can cause the film to be dated to some people after some time has passed. The writing isn't too great at times and like I said, the character actions can just feel so cheesy and corny to me. They also take no artistic liberties (in MY OPINION) with this film at all (camera work, lighting/cinematography, score/soundtrack, character emotion/execution). It all just feels uninspired, it feels like they did what works and what makes a film, on a base level, a film. That goes for characters, their arcs, progression and or their development. To the settings (this film has no idea where it wants to take place) and overall execution of the film. The film, at times, feels like something you'd see as a special on TV.Despite it seeming like I have a lot of negatives on the film, it still doesn't do anything that makes me Hate Nor Love It. Its a simple film that can be nuanced and has a pretty good message about stuff that does happen in real life. I enjoy some of Common's moment in this movie as well as Russell Hornby's. I see what they were going for in this film, especially with the main character Starr. I love the idea of duality, especially with the plot and setting put forth. I feel like this film and its characters would have been A LOT better with the right director and writers. Given some time, this would have been a truly amazing movie. Oh well!

Amandla sees her best friend get shot and has to find the courage to speak up about the hatred and racism that fuels the streets. i have to admit i couldn't get through this film without crying because it showed the true love between each other but also the unspoken racism that gets forgot too much in America or any country.

Amandla loses her best friend to a gun shot when a police man kills him by mistaking a hairbrush for a gun. now many many stories like this appear in the media everyday, in any country, but especially America. these stories become high news for about a week and then are forgotten. but in this film we get the explore that racism has all those affected by the lose and the repercussions that it leaves behind for the next generation. This film is definitely worth a watch, to anyone or everyone.

(The mindset is basically, if u are ignorant from the start then i do not want to be near you whatsoever. no conversation to justify exactly the things that 'her people' are doing in a calm and open-minded manner). btw this is coming from a kid raised in a multi-racial family (Arab, indian, malay, chinese)Despite the okay story and the misrepresentation on several aspects, i would've given this movie a 6 or 7 if only the editing didn't feel so cheap and choppy. they just put in generic music in most of the 'emotional' scenes, like legit no hesitation whatsoever, just put in as much music as possible. and most of the time the music provided just takes you away from the feel of the whole movie.If you want to watch it, i wouldn't say it's a waste of time, as it may bring you a new perspective, but overall i felt like the movie itself is ruined by the music.

I watched the whole movie twice and I found myself noticing little details that make the movie much more interesting.One of them, for example, is how when Starr's at home, the color scheme is way more warm. While when she's at school, and she puts on her persona, the color scheme is more blue, and more cold, as to represent how she feels better at home when she can just be herself.The thing I enjoyed the most was the touching to my heart. I am a black bisexual women, so I'm not surprised when people naturally don't like me. I've been called racist and sexist names yet I have never experienced something as heavy as Starr and Khalil. I do see videos circulating around, exposing police brutality, and it baffles me every time to see such an act of pure hate while the people are begging for their life.I would be crazy to not enjoy this movie, even after being personally marked by it. I love it so much and I would recommend it, 10/10. I did not waste my time watching it, and it will always hold a certain place in my heart.",The Hate U Give

Only difference is America has a moral conscience and constantly tries to correct the wrongdoings of history while India is in denial about its wrongdoings and actively suppresses people from unprivileged background.Here are the experiences of Starr Carter which most of our people find completely relatable
1. The Black Panther movement her father is part of, we have a similar movement.
2. The constantly switching of personality between her own people and white people. Hiding your true self to get accepted.
3. Constantly hearing sly racist comments and yet not able to do anything about it but stay silent while you mind is angry as hell.
4. The character Hailey who pretends to not be racist is constantly making racist remarks and is a racist. I had friends like those, after watching this movie i have decided to not be friends like this people anymore. I have unfriended them on social media and have deleted their numbers.
5. The portrayal in media as stupid and taking the worst elements of the group to portray the entire community as wrong.
6. Police brutality and denial of justice.
7. Black people suppressing other black people.There are so many moments in the movie where i had tears in my eyes and i could see my people going through the same thing. I was emotional throughout the movie. The articulation of frustration of oppressed people is so real and raw.Most people who are giving this movie bad reviews are looking it from technical perspective and dont have the lived experience of the people.

It was well done, well executed, and the acting was superb.I saw a review saying it came across as ""anti police and anti white"". That is not the case. That view is overlooking the fact that this movie is telling a story from a certain perspective, that of Starr, who is a young black woman. It is telling Starr's experience with police brutality after experiencing it first hand. People are too quick to generalize, especially with a message like this. Black lives matter isn't saying white lives don't matter, or blue lives don't matter. Black lives matter isn't anti white, and it's not anti police. They are not mutually exclusive. It's just more important that people see and understand that BLACK LIVES MATTER, because with the state of the USA you wouldn't believe that because of what people are seeing and what they are experiencing on a daily basis.This movie is incredibly important for white people to see because maybe then we'll get it through our thick skulls that black people are people and their lives are important and they MATTER.",The Hate U Give
236,lorie916,Great story - right on the mark.,5,23 January 2019,"Surprising how many reviewers didn't get this movie - as the white mother of a black son, it certainly resonated for me. My son was the same age (in an area of Crips in Seattle in 1988) coming home in our neighborhood when he had an incident with the police (again, traffic), and a gun was also pulled on him. It was one of the few times he was alone in the car, without me or one of his friends.
As a white parent, I had NO idea what it would be like to suddenly have police yelling and pounding on my front door in the middle of the night.
My son was also one of only two black students when he went to a private middle school, and yes, I'll bet he could relate to that a bit, too.
I thought the acting was great, particularly Mr. Hornsby, who played a heroic and protective father, and one whose life was changed for love of his family. And every parent of a black child has had those talks with their kids - ""if you're on the street, don't run away - do what they say to do. If you're in the car, move very slowly and obey directions"". For white people out there (some reviewers) who were upset about the portrayal of the police, keep in mind that the police are the ones who LIVE through these incidents, not the driver.

249,bigmekdanskull,A commentary on the troubles of society,7,9 October 2018,"As a white guy who's spent all of his life in England, it's hard for me to relate to most of the issues raised in this movie. However I feel the actors did a fantastic job of helping me see from the characters perspective, in what is undoubtedly tricky subject matter.I found Russell Hornsby's portrayal of a father who's lead a colourful life, leaving it behind to concentrate on raising his children in what he sees as the right way, particularly compelling.Amandla Stenberg was fantastic in the lead role. A teenager struggling to deal with the loss of a friend, and the injustice that follows. The feeling of barely contained rage was palpable in some scenes. There is strong theme of societal injustice throughout the movie. The blame isn't placed squarely at the door of ""white America"" as some have suggested. The film doesn't shy away from gang & drug problems that plague communities across America & the wider world.I feel like its a shame, that one of the few scenes that detract from my overall enjoyment of this movie, was the films most pivotal scene. I felt no real sense of injustice attached to this. If I was pulled over by a cop in the US, I'm doing exactly what he/she tells me. Instead the character Khalil (Algee Smith) decides it's the right time to have some fun with his friend Starr (Stenberg). This leads to his death, and while racial profiling certainly had a part to play in the incident, the actions of Khalil ultimately were what lead to his demise. Perhaps the way I view this scene says more about my place in society, or society as a whole, but it's hard for me to see it any other way. 
It's interesting that later in the film, a scene between Starr & her uncle Carlos (portrayed by Common) gives us some insight into what would have been going through the cops head as he carried out the traffic stop.Overall I thought it was a good movie with some emotional & tense scenes, acted very well & is definitely one to watch.",The Hate U Give

I'm disappointed that the film wasn't a bigger success financially.Great casting with Amandla Stenberg taking the lead. She is going to be a HUGE star in the coming years.",The Hate U Give

256,tkagadavis,It was alright,5,13 July 2019,"I know that is has been almost a year since it came out, but after watching this, I thought it would be fun to talk about it.
The best part of the film was all the actors who played the main character Starr and her family. Although I thought there were some iffy moments in the little kid's acting, it was mostly convincing that they were a family. The themes and what the film is commentating was very interesting and pretty well done for the most part.
The biggest problem I had was Khalil's death. I thought it was a huge waste to start with Star growing up with Khalil. This could've made me experience what Starr was processing. Khalil is just a sympathetic character and not an empathetic character. Everything we are supposed to care about him and his life is told instead of shown. This stopped me from feeling the same emotions Starr had. Another problem I had was the character King. I know that it is supposed to make his character more intimidating or threatening but, how did he always knew where Starr and her family were? I know he is supposed to be stalking but how was he able to track down Starr and her brother when they in a starnger's car? Things like this happened about 5 times and it started to bug me a lot. Another thing I didn't like was some of the decisions many characters make. It didn't make sense. A lot of these decisions were in character, but come on, when are you going to make the right decisions when you had made so many mistakes? I also thought the score wasn't great and Sabrina Carpenter's acting wasn't great.
Although there were many flaws it didn't make me ruin the experience of this intense, emotional and thought provoking film. I would recommend it to people who love films that says something about racism, violence and police brutality. However I think that watching Blindspotting would be a better experience for most people.",The Hate U Give
257,reemagerashi,"Brilliant, real & engaging.",8,23 October 2018,"""The Hate U Give"" is an empowering story portrayed through a clear lens. Whilst most filmmakers can say they've ""touched"" upon strikingly important issues, this one says it all. The angle taken upon the film can be deemed simple by some because it's a harsh reality that the black community faces in America. As film watchers we've never been exposed to a piece which immensely surrounds this one message in a manner that is both enraging and inspiring. As for the complexity of it, delivering such a real and difficult message is not a straight forward task. With a rock solid female lead surrounded by a great supporting cast, I can say it's nothing besides an outstanding performance from a great visual viewpoint. A brilliant film which stems from its sharp writing, consisting of a notable balance of light hearted humor along with tragedy and reality.",The Hate U Give

265,gribanisrine,Social separation; one unit yet still fighting,7,27 January 2019,"Late 2018 the movie 'The Hate U Give' was released, the title say it all, it's what THUG stands for.The movie was based on a novel by Angie Thomas but the screenplay was written by Audrey Wells; who died one day before the release date. This film was promoted under the following quote: 'Two words, one voice, no going back'; that's a summery of the movie's story.'The Hate U Give' is about a girl -Star Carter- who constantly switching between the neighborhood where she lives; a poor and mostly black residence and the school she attends located in a rich white neighborhood. Keeping a balance between these too was never easy, but once she witnessed the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend -Khalil- at the hands of a white police officer, her life got shaky.Amand Stenberg was fantastic in the lead role, as a strong African American teenage girl struggling to deal with the pressure from all of the community. An other plus is the presentation of the flus such as drug dealing and gangs. On the other hand, there is quit much of bad aspects, for instance the stereotypes since it shows the black sociality as a useless and the cause of any failures also attaches crime to it, while giving a good impression about the white-privilege.To conclude, 'The Hate U Give' is neither a movie that I like or dislike, still the movie's amazing technical card -creative production as well as the sound effects- makes it worth to see.",The Hate U Give

268,scalesa-59670,Review for The Hate U Give,10,14 March 2019,"Every since I had began watch different movies that related to race and gun-violence, they would all have the same story plot that made them not as different from the others. No matter if they had a different meaning to what they might've been talking about they had the same outlook on things like slavery, and racism that took place a long time ago. Many times the movies weren't even explaining someone's life but just a group of people living through the same things everyday. Although most of the movies are alike, I haven't seen something as quite like ""The Hate U Give"" by Angie Thomas.
The movie really relates to the book and some things that people might have dealt with in our time now and it gives everyone a vision on not only race but overcoming challenges, experiencing new things, and making an impact on the people of your town. The movie is set in 2018 and reviews the many aspects of the way people in the lower parts of towns are treated compared to others. There's gangs, cruelty, discrimination, laughter, and tears that are brought out in the movie that everyone needs to see to get a better image of things.
I would recommend this movie for everyone because of the amazing cast and the way that they relate to the description based off the book, also for the plot which is the way that everything turns out in the end of the story. You will begin to understand why the actors were chosen for the many ways that they can do certain things that others cant, and for the many others roles that they have similarly acted in other movies. The movie is also very moving to all the surrounding communities that might have had the same things happen to them and it might inspire them to do certain things for there area. I also think that it helps grab many people's attention of what is going on in society between the racial stance in many people's life. The movie grabs everyone's attention by continuing to move to the next topic of how much we can do to in order to change the way people look on others based off background and many more. With this movie I believe there will be a new way of seeing things for everyone no matter their circumstances.
In the movie you get to see Starr and the two worlds she is divided between. On one side she is this fun, outgoing girl in the town of Garden Heights. However while she goes to school in a white neighborhood it is hard for her to be her full self without coming off as ""ghetto"". Throughout the book she is trying to figure out how to bring those two worlds together and to remain from telling all of her old and new home town experiences. The movie really grasps the audience's attention when speaking about standing up for what you believe in.
Amandla Stenberg, the actor who plays Starr, has played many other roles that makes her stand out in this movie. Many of the roles that she has played have contributed to her motive of already knowing to stand up for what she believes in throughout her character, and this takes the movie to a whole other level. The father and mother Maverick Carter and Lisa Carter played by Russell Hornsby and Regina Hall both have an equal amount of responsibility for how great the story turned out as well. They contribute a sense of reality that other kids already experience in their homes which made their family time and dinners very relatable. The family made the movie have humor, flashbacks, and hard times which brought not only more character but made the audience feel attached to the characters a little more than before because of the information that they received.
However, the plot of the movie played a huge part in how the movie went as well. Without the many humorous moments, the ones that left you on the edge of your seat, and the ones that made you cry the movie wouldn't make sense. The director and author knew what they were doing and had an original idea for the movie to turn out the way that it did which really payed off. The very similar roles that the plot played with connecting to the world that we also live in it also helped show how to plot changed the ideas and thoughts as a whole.
After finishing the movie, I can say that it is the best motivational and inspiring movie of the the time now in the theaters. According to Plugged In, a movie and book reviewing website, ""The movie is a sophisticated adaption for a hugely important book that adeptly handles it's daunting themes"". This quote really relates to what the movie portrays to the audience and throughout relating to the book as well as going into more depth of things that happened.
I could continue to go on about the many things that can be brought out in the movie, but i'll conclude by saying. I would recommend this movie to many people of certain ages, and others who like movies that show empowerment, leadership, and people who have watched other movies similar to this like Selma and Mississippi Burning. However, I think everyone can find something they like or gain something from watching this amazing realistic fiction movie.",The Hate U Give

When the police tells you not to move, you do not move. Police has commonly got killed from stopping people and it is needless to say, they have a family to get back to at the end of the day and what they do is a simple self defence.

As soon as the officer pulled up to his window Khalil was being difficult like the office told him the reason he pulled him over. It's common sense to turn off loud music when a police officer is talking and just obviously hand him your license and registration. Then after being told by the officer to stand still, he decides to joke around and grab a hairbrush and brush his hair. I mean he was already being difficult and not listening to the officer's orders, The officer was already suspicious no wonder he got frightened when he pulled out a random object from his car. Of course, there was no reason for the officer to shoot by any means. The officer could have tased him or just inspected the situation instead of assuming the worst.",The Hate U Give

I believe people hated this movie because it was one sided, but that was the whole point of the film. For one, Starr went to an all-white school and had many friends that unfortunately didn't understand the significance of the death of Khalil. They didn't set white people to be ""evil"" since this frequently happens and is why the movie is bringing awareness. The movie didn't take us 50 years back in history since the problems in the film are happening today. These were the type of reviews I saw on this movie and I truly believe they weren't paying attention to the movie or were just ignorant. The people giving the film one star for portraying white people as ""evil"" or are mad it's all one sided was the reason why the movie was made.

276,daisyvaldez-03837,Pushed the bad cop agenda too much.,1,16 March 2020,"The movie started out interesting until I noticed the bad cop agenda was starting to be pushed.. and a little too much.

As soon as I saw that scene, I paused the movie and deleted it. Just because there are some bad cops doesn't mean they're all the same. I was reading in the other reviews that the book is better than the movie but after seeing that, don't know if I should get the book. The movie was too biased and it made me really upset. I also think it was released during a bad time, making the whole division in the country even worse than it already is. Also, a character that I really disliked was Starr's dad.

As a white person this has opened my eyes even more to just how hard it is to solely be black in America. The lines like ""if a black man reached in his car after I told him to not move I would shoot without hesitation. But if a white man with a suit and a Mercedes reached in the car after I told him not to move I would say 'put your hands up'"" this movie is difficult to watch if you have any empathy for black people and understanding of racism.

But these ideas were underdeveloped.It would have been an altogether better film to have had some character development of the officer that does the shooting. Some scenes of him in training, a past incident, everything that led up to the fatal decision to open fire.Unfortunately, we don't see him after the incident and he simply becomes objectified as the focus of Starr's building rage.",The Hate U Give
288,kpak7825,The Hate We give...,9,10 November 2018,"Wow. I am not really sure where to start. Maybe, I will start with a little background about myself. I am Irish; I am African American; I am both; yet still experience things in this life differently than both. Not white enough to be white and not black enough to be black as some people say. I have experienced everything from both sides of the spectrum. It helps to relate to certain emotions I experienced while watching this movie. I lived a very similar life to the characters in this movie. In my early years grew up in a predominately African American neighborhood where crime, drugs and death were a usual occupation for most of the youth in the area. Things in my neighborhood turned for the worse and my parents moved us out into the suburbs which created a whole new type of racism. There I was consistently and constantly pulled over and racially profiled. I was harassed and beaten brutally because of the color of my skin. My white girlfriend and I were constantly harassed by the local police by being pulled over continuously and almost never receiving any kind of ticket or summons, but searched thoroughly every time for drugs, guns, or whatever they could think of at a drop of a hat. The movie...
I can say that each and every character in this movie I can relate to in my life to say that I have one of each personification as a friend, acquaintance, or fair-weather friend. The dialogue is at times a cliché use of ""black"" slang and jargon that ties each character well. I do not like or appreciate some things in this movie and there are things that I absolutely love. Imma jump right into it. The police are portrayed a little bit on the rough side. I didn't like that they were so harshly personified. I have met my share of good ones and my fair share of really bad and racist ones. I give them all the same respect because as a black man in this country, you have to watch every step you take with careful examination and consideration that they will shoot you at the slimmest mistake; and yes, I am going to say it, this is happens more to black people than white however you take that it's what I see and what I have experienced. This movie hits the nail harshly on the head with such precision that even the slightest movement would miss the mark. Common's character was my favorite when talking about blunt honest and brutal truth when it comes to being pulled over by a police officer. I liked how they broke it down and elaborated on major points. I don't want to give too much away about the movie but I have to say that its use of the terms like ""T.H.U.G. L.I.F.E"" and the proper use of only certain parts of the Black Panther's 10 point program were awesome. To break the cycle of hate and death in the black community is felt overwhelmingly in this movie's execution. 2pac has and will always be immortalized in his music and how he saw the world in the tumultuous times of the 90's. The soundtrack and music choices are great and very much enjoyed the musical score. Growing up during this same era, this movie makes very good use of the social, economic, and financial strife that black people incurred in, and after the New Jack Era. See what I did there? The exemplification of the decadence of narcotics and wielding of weapons by black men is a usual generalization that they used in this movie and I didn't care for it either way. I quote, ""It is what it is"". The movie has glimpses of greatness and holes with proper character development but all in all. I enjoyed the movie. It isn't a top 10. It's not even a top 20, but, it tackles hard issues of our present time. It brings to light topics that in our current political and social climate can aggravate some; empowering others. If you can open your mind and allow certain clichés to be what they are and understand the larger meaning behind the movie then you will find great enjoyment in it. When your voice needs to be heard and there is some sort of obstruction to your happiness, your civil rights, your well-being, your family, your freedom, this movie screams it loud and clear that we will have our voice heard, ""By any means necessary"".",The Hate U Give

294,ebkamikaze,A Perspective Film,8,4 October 2018,"I believe this film creates an opportunity to open the eyes of someone not privy to our perspective. Sometimes they have to see these issues play out in front of them. A story or speech may not reach deep enough to connect you to the heart of people who have suffered loss and live in a near impossible situation. If you just see it as a I HATE WHITES movie, you've missed the point. Dig deeper. Do I have some criticisms, of course. Some scenarios are obvious slaves to plot progression. One argument could be that only 1-2 characters had a complete arc and that some questions were left unanswered. Well, I agree. That's art imitating life. I believe the dialogue regarding the title of the film was clever and introspective that I haven't been able to get it out of my head. It also asks me to form MY OWN opinion of the phrase's meaning. 
So: Mission Accomplished. I'd say the acting was pretty good. Not the biggest fan of the language but unfortunately I know I'm in the minority there. Every character performed. It was exciting to see Anthony Mackie in this role. I think he sold it. Seven's actor stole his scenes. I believe that Common was allowed him to play himself, because a farther reach may not be believable. Amandla is something special. She is such a star and I can't wait to see what's in store for her.

299,John-658-634224,Showed great promise but ultimately disappointing,6,18 July 2021,"I started watching this film and I was greatly enjoying it. The characters were interesting and the scene of the 'shooting' was done in a sympathetic and believable way. The young man acted like an idiot but in no way deserved to die. The equally young officer shot first and asked questions later but there was no doubt whatsoever that he had thought the boy had a gun. So far so good.I was hoping to see the film develop into a moral dilemma for the protagonist (Starr) but sadly it disappointed. From this point on the film became a Black Lives Matter propaganda piece with non of the nuance or sensitivity that this extremely complex issue deserves. Two of my most disappointing moments were when Starr asks her uncle why he would shoot first on a Black man but not a White man. In the film he is speechless but I would have liked him to articulate the real world reasons why he (a Black man) would not give another Black man the benefit of telling them to 'put their hands up' before shooting. This should have been a deep conversation, instead it was a cheap point scoring exercise against the police. The next point where my respect for the film broke down was when Starr was given the microphone. I was hoping for an eloquent call for peaceful protest but instead we got aggressive chanting which escalated the situation.All in all very disappointing from an extremely promising start.I think I will read the book to see if it is delivered from a more balanced and reasoned perspective.",The Hate U Give

This movie is a projection of just one problem America has and since this nation is more focused on entertainment then on reality this was a reall good move to make this kind of a movie.
The message is not only one sided, but at the end they go deeper and actually make people realize what is the root of the problem.

But I do think it is a hugely crucially important one because it is a movie about racial profiling, based on real life events, that I can take my ore teen kid to see. She loved the book, she loved the movie, it made her think, and cry, and see. So yes of course it's simplistic, it ticks off cliches, it's not as nuanced as it could be. But my kid couldn't come close to understanding or enjoying a movie by spike lee or Barry Jenkins, and I am hugely grateful for this one. Plus, to be honest, I really liked it - I cried, and got angry, and thought a lot myself.

our main character star witnesses her friend being shot by a police officer and then events spiral as he never had a weapon just a hairbrush.
We then follow Starr trying to make sense of it and weather she should stand up and speak out or let the 'white' people at her school continue to be predujice or help them to change?In all the movie does get you asking questions.
Why does this still happen in this day and age?
Would police be this trigger happy if it was a white male?This film does not deserve anything below an 8 as it's well acted and we'll directed and an independent movie that asks do you see what's happening?

316,apeachy,Extremely one sided,1,10 February 2019,"I went into this movie with an open mind. I appreciated that they tried to bring attention to relevant issues, but they went about it entirely wrong. The gang was ultimately the antagonist, and to me that seems really counterproductive. They made every single white person with the exception of Chris seem like the most insensitive and apathetic racist person ever. That's not the reality of the way the world works.The whole thing just frustrated me to no end. There's more to the story than a white cop killing a black man simply because he's black. The issue is really complex and the movie did the black community no favors. They showed the worst sides of everyone, and just left me feeling empty and annoyed at humanity.The kid who sadly passed away in the movie is not faultless either. His death is tragic and terrible, but if he had just listened to the police officer this whole thing could have been avoided. The whole things was a mess and I definitely wish I hadn't wasted my time on this movie.",The Hate U Give

However, about half an hour into the movie I became so drawn in I could barely take my eyes off of the screen for more than a second. The chemistry between the characters felt so real and I really believed everything Amandla Stenburg said within the script. There was a passion and motive behind every word, something I deeply appreciate as an actress myself. The atmosphere created was so natural and not only was the film captivating, it was educational. There is so much occurring in our world that I feel we aren't 100% aware about, and films like this raise more and more awareness about subjects that may be difficult to talk about or pushed to the side too easily.

I believe the movie did the book justice and it took a serious look at police brutality and the black lives matter movement as well as complexities of what it may feel and be like to live as a poc (specifically African American). I admit, this movie may make you feel uncomfortable, there was also times where you have comedic relief and where you may even cry and feel. Overall I think it was an amazing film with great acting, and very important topics that we're showcased in a way to make the viewer think.

The actors we're stellar. There were some spots where the story became contrived and in places I felt that in real life it probably would have gotten worse for the characters. The big question is if it will open the eyes of Americans who are living in their sweet privileged little world's? Will they even bother to see a ""black"" movie? I hope so.

This is definitely not a movie that steps out of reality. This movie touches upon subjects that are relevant in our society: police brutality, racism, stereotyping, and presents them in a fashion that we are not unfamiliar with. However, it does so by using a story of personal struggle to find self identity and purpose, even if that means giving up certain things. This movie is by no means perfect, but it's intent makes up for a lot of the issues that I could have with it.

348,nicholasHasaDog,"Just got back from the theater, and yes this film is worth your time...",10,19 October 2018,"Beautiful, thought-provoking, well-crafted gem-thank you to everyone involved in making this wonderful film. Although this film is a ""message movie,"" it's not one told through narrow-minded tunnel vision; I think the author (Angie Thomas) of the book, that this film is based on, understands the frustrating fact that some of the worst issues that need fixing have no quick and easy solutions, and are complex and take time for the human mind to understand (especially to the minds of those who aren't being affected / victimized, who inevitably take longer to understand). Fortunately this movie provides a narrative that can help one consider the issue of racial bias.In addition to being a wonderful social commentary, it's also a wonderful film and story in general. Honestly I loved the music, all the scenes, the complexity of the situation the main characters find them in, I loved the ending, and I loved the characters.When I saw the 5.9 on imdb but higher critic score, I thought this movie simply got good reviews from the critics because the critics liked that it brought up a real-life issue that needed to be delved into and explored, but that it was boring to the audience who might not care about social issues as much, but now after watching it... I wonder if the people who rated it low even watched the film, or they simply thought it was some sort of ignorant propaganda biased on the trailers. I promise you it's not that; it's a complex, thought-provoking fictional world that mirrors issues of the real world in the best way possible.I'm not black btw, and that's all the more reason why I should be a member in the audience; I've never experienced anything like this first hand. If a God said this film could only be shown to every black person in America or every non-black person, I would say with absolute certainty that every non-black would be the ones who need to see it. But it's a really good film for everyone, regardless of race. Even if you're not too interested in social issues, it's just a good story in general to get absorbed in for a couple hours.So good... 9/10 from me, but the 5.9 makes me give it a bit of extra credit, so I gave it a 10.",The Hate U Give

It personally hit me because I work at an almost all white school and have grown attached to a young man who is like Starr. He has said to me some of the very thoughts Starr said.

Also the whole thing on what THUG LIFE stands for really made me think its one of the most true things i've ever heard. I'm honestly in shock and its been like 7 hours since I've seen this movie now and i still can't get over how amazing it is.

Thank you for portraying this on the big screen!!!! I cried most of the way through it, with my 17 ur old daughter sitting next to me on mommy/daughter night, saying ""mommy stop crying ok. It's ok"" I have 4 grandchildren, 5 children 4 girls and ONE boy, the oldest 3 girls Range from 26-21, then my 17 yr old who I saw the movie with and my 14 year old AMAZING son. It ripped my heart apart to know that he TOO, may experience this one day simply due to the color of his skin. He is an outstanding student , and an AMAZING football player, well mannered, very polite, extremely respectful and does everything he is supposed to, which is not just me saying this because he is my son, but everyone who comes into contact with him says the exact same thing, yet, I STILL had to have ""the talk"" with him a few years ago about just what THIS movie portrays. Smh. When is our world going to open their eyes and realize that... WE ARE ALL ONE. And all that matters is LOVE. regardless of the color of our skin. I raised ALL of my kids to not look at skin color, and not to judge people by what they look like because you never know who they are, what they are about, what they have been through, etc. can we ALL do this please! We owe it to this next generation so they don't have to go through this TOO!!

362,alecrisbi,READ THE BOOK,7,24 July 2020,"The book was fantastic, the movie... not so much. It's not a bad movie, but it's not even close to how nuanced and emotional the book was. I feel like you'll enjoy it more if you don't read the book first because otherwise you'll be disappointed.",The Hate U Give
363,elmont-46956,Brilliant!!!!,10,28 October 2018,"The Hate U Give, is by far the best movie that people need to see, it made me laugh, cry, and think, being a black man in America I understand the difficulty we face on a daily from both sides of the spectrum, being racially attack from authorities and being fearful to stand up to my own community, this movie attached ever aspect of the equator, this movie is a definitely much see",The Hate U Give
364,derrian-24621,Well Worth the $10,10,29 October 2018,"Today I took some time out to go to the movies. Normally, if its just me, I want to just go laugh but something in me said to go see another movie, ""The Hate U Give."" I was in the movies alone which wasn't a surprise being the time of day and the location that the theatre was in but I tell you what. I cried about 5 times. This movie showed the life that I moved away from but still live through in a different way. I would strongly suggest that people of all races watch this movie. Sometimes I tell people stories of things that have happened to me and they can't believe it because they are not that way. But what people fail to understand is that just because they are not that way doesn't mean that other people aren't.",The Hate U Give
365,jbunny-41062,A strong message and a hard look at reality,10,3 November 2018,"This movie is a true message about things that happen today. It doesn't matter what neighborhood it can happen. It's not a message about hating people at all but a hard look at injustice especially if you are a minority. You don't have to be of black or African decent to relate to this. I'm an Asian American and it brought me all types of emotions because I've seen, heard, and witness this happening before it's in our news. I can totally relate. You don't have to be in this scenario to understand it. The movie made me teary because it's human nature. It draws you in and makes you ask questions and it tests your emotions. It's not about whose side your on it's about understanding that injustice does happen and it makes you understand what a black person or minority can feel in certain situations. It's a strong message about racial bias. It was very powerful !!! I'd recommend anyone to watch !!!",The Hate U Give

369,dreluv-77081,For Teenagers Not Adults,3,7 November 2018,"This movie had some good scenes, but the same negative narratives of black people. The father's role and responsibility to his family was great, giving his children love, hope, faith, strength, and courage no matter what obstacle they would have to overcome. The negative narrative was that black people are still, partying, selling drugs, drinking alcohol, fighting and even the black police officer (uncle) selling out his race and faith to keep his job as a policeman. I thought this movie was teach teens how to be more involved in politics, politician's, importance of voting, uphold legislators and State senators to do what they have been voted to do, which is lead, without bias and hold officials accountable for wrong doing such as policeman, being the judge, jury, and prosecutor.",The Hate U Give
370,littlemspigggirl,Doesn't even compare to the book.,2,8 November 2018,"The original book version is a million times better than the movie. The characters in the movie were all very one sided whereas in the book, you go in depth with the characters and their relationships.Which brings me to the next point, WHERE IS THE CHARACTER DEVANTE? I'm genuinely pissed... They took out a character that was crucial to finding out Khalil's real personality, SO WHERE IS HE??? I will forever hold a grudge against this movie for taking away my favorite character.Also, in the book, the author clearly states that Garden Hights has been filled with riots, so much so that the father had to go over to take care of the score (which, by the way, was only mentioned one in the movie). Instead in the movie, they decided to make a single protest that was later classified as a riot.",The Hate U Give
371,rianne-74671,Movie,10,24 November 2018,"I feel this movie hit home for lots of teenagers. It was jammed packed with almost every emotion teens go though; yet, it held true to what is happening at the time it was released. The casts did an amazing job and I am so proud of the newcoming actors & actresses for this industry. Special thanks goes out to the writers, producers, director, and equipment crew who made this movie possible.",The Hate U Give
372,jeeman-44639,Privileged reviewers hating on this movie don't have a clue,10,11 November 2018,"Any privileged person hating this movie does not have any idea of what its like to live in this type of atmosphere, where minorities are often treated like second class citizens. These Archie Bunker like commentaries are from the ignorant privileged who want to keep the status quo, who cannot look at their own Hate in the mirror.",The Hate U Give
373,llltriples,Better than I thought,9,12 November 2018,"I have never done a review on a movie, but I must say I appreciate this movie on many aspects. It was the perfect movie for my 18 and 13 year old daughters. Watching the news or hearing about the violent things that's portrayed in our environment was an eye opener to what I teach my girls. Although we are surrounded by violence here in Detroit, I pray and thank God every day that my kids has never had to experience with any of it. So for them to see this film they were able to understand my teaching points. Especially with the police brutality that goes on at times. I wish some kind of justice could have been saved on the movie, but then again that would not have been real life. As for me and my household, we enjoyed every bit of it. My husband is a hard man to please when it comes to movies and he was pleased.",The Hate U Give
374,cwaters-83940,There is one line that stands out amongst all,8,13 November 2018,"This movie is great overall. It had alot of mixture of poor neighborhood and what it is like with gangs in the neighborhoods where not much opportunity is given. On the flip side it gives hope and aspiration that you can make it out and despite what you've seen and witnessed through life, you can still make it. But there is one scene that steals the cake in why this movie was made. ""If you were in a black neighborhood and someone reached in their car police are told not to hesitate and shoot, but in a white neighborhood if a white person reaches in their car to say put your hands up"". That honestly is the part that kills me about this movie and I feel is very messed up and the reason for this movie. It is a well developed movie. Definitely a must see.",The Hate U Give
375,alexismercedes-63457,Language and theme disturbing and lacking,2,14 November 2018,"I had to leave the theatre, the language was way too intense, rated R dialogue. The message was by no means one that u would want young people to walk away with. It was very disappointing and lacking in depth.",The Hate U Give
376,jasmiinepriimas,"I don't normally leave movie reviews, but this was a MUST!!",10,21 November 2018,"Okay so I didn't know how powerful this was and how deeply it would touch my soul, but it did just that. Some reviewers will say that the writers were just trying to do too much, and that the story can come off to be unbelievable for one family or young girl to go through. It was a lot! But the matter of the fact is that this story line is the story line of many black families. This is REAL LIFE for us, so I'm sorry if the movie makes you feel uncomfortable, but movies like this is what educated our young black men and women on the world that we are living in and have been living in for centuries!!I would go see this movie again, and again, and again. Be ready to CRY your heart out because you will do just THAT!",The Hate U Give
377,lilimparis,The movie that changed the way I view the world,10,29 November 2018,"The Hate U Give movie was based on the best seller book by Angie Thomas. I highly recommend everyone see this movie because, it is relevant, shows the power of young voices and allows viewers to see the world from a different perspective.It is a touching story about an African-American girl, named Starr, who lives in a poor neighborhood called Garden Heights. There have been gangs and police problems there since as long as anyone can remember. She goes to school in a preppy neighborhood called Williamson. She pretends to be 2 different versions of herself because neither groups of people will understand each other. After a party one night, her friend Khalil drives home and gets pulled over. The white police officer suspects something and shoots Khalil. Starr fights for justice for her friend. It shows that even today in day, people are still not fair in their judgement. And they still think there is a superior kind of people.In this story, Starr finds her voice to fight for justice. Not only justice for Khalil but for all her people. She stands up to a friend and for what she believes is right. She relizes how much the people close to her mean and how important it is to have people who care. But also to be careful to not lose the people that care too. Even though she was just a 16 year old witness but she was able to raise so much awareness and protests for what happened. Even though you may be young and think your voice doesn't matter, people will still care if you are passionate enough.The movie really touched me and made me think about the world a little differently because now I can see that I'm not the only type of person in the world and neither all the other people in my neighborhood or even in San Antonio. There are so many other people in the world with other situations and lives whether it be better than mine or worse, they are all people and they deserve respect and equality. I think that it is important to recognize different people in the world. Whether they be a different color, a different background or just a different person. I think we should respect those people and even though they may be different then us, they are still a person and they deserve the same rights and respect that we get. I think that the movie defiantly hits these points that I just mentioned.",The Hate U Give
378,meganoc-82431,Who knew it was possible to make a movie this terrible,1,16 December 2018,Way to promote racial division. Its a choice to be the stereotype. Only the dumbest fall for this garbage.,The Hate U Give

380,anajula,A powerful movie! a MUST WATCH,9,29 January 2019,"This is the first time I'm writing a review and I'm only doing it cause i see a lot of (probably white) people writing horrible reviews to a movie with such a great and relevant story. I am white myself but these reviews are truly embarrassing, this movie gives you an insight into what life can be like for the majority of the working class black people. It's raw and it touches a lot of contemporary issues. It does present the arguments for both sides, however, you must be sick not to acknowledge that violence against black people is extremely high in America, and that police officers have a lot to learn. Please watch (even if you're a racist ***,it might change your mind)",The Hate U Give
381,jequestriann,Anyone growing up in this generation needs to see this,10,21 February 2019,"This movie is hard to watch. It is so real and especially with news that is on tv these days most people can some how relate to this. I personally can not relate to this, however with the stories that I've seen and people I've talked to this hits hard. Knowing that this could happen to friends of mine or teachers I have is rough. This is a perfect movie to watch if you want to feel how many people in this society feel on a daily basis. Everyone needs to see this.",The Hate U Give
