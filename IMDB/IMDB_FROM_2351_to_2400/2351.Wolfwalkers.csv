0,SnoopyStyle,beautiful and wonderous,9,8 August 2021,"It's 1650 Ireland. Robyn Goodfellowe is an English girl living with her widowed father Bill (Sean Bean) in the walled town of Kilkenny. He is a wolf hunter tasked by the Lord Protector to clear out the nearby woods. She is desperate to join him in the hunts but he forbids it. She follows him anyways and encounters a Wolfwalker.This is wonderous. The story is heart-wrenching. It is beautifully drawn. Its use of Celtic imagery is magnificent. I love the characters. It is near perfection. It did get an Oscar nomination. I love The Secret of Kells and I think I love this slightly more, very slightly.",Wolfwalkers
1,CinemaSerf,"Gripping, enchanting - well worth a watch.",7,19 March 2021,"How utterly refreshing to watch an animation that tells a good, solid, story with strong characterisations and a great vocal cast that is not, necessarily, designed to just maximise box office revenues. It's a relatively straightforward story of an hunter ""Goodfellowe"" who, along with his young daughter ""Robyn"" (Honor Kneafsey) is recruited to hunt down a pack of wolves near the town of Kilkenny, of whom the local populace are terrified. The wolves live in an ancient forest and are having to come to terms with the increased human intervention in their lives, and with their habitat - and when one of their number disappears, the young ""Mebh"" (Eva Whittaker) makes contact with the young ""Robyn"" and together, the two try to track down the missing wolf and to find some more peaceful way for humanity and their lupine adversaries to live in peace. The animation is simple, yet sophisticated - building on a rich vein of Celtic mythology and some age-old fears and stereotypes that still exist some 370 years after this enchanting mystery is set. The pace mixes the cerebral and the action, with plenty going on for both eye and brain to appreciate. Even Sean Bean (who's angularly featured image matches so well his usually wooden acting style) manages to inject some humanity into what is essential a very enjoyable story of live and let live...",Wolfwalkers
2,morrison-dylan-fan,Spirit animal.,10,23 November 2020,"After viewing the interesting Josep (2020-also reviewed) I decided to look at the other two feature film titles in the Manchester Animation Festival line-up. Having really enjoyed Song of the Sea (2014-also reviewed) I was excited to see a stream of the latest film by the studio taking place,with a question and answer interview with the makers afterwards,leading to me walking with the wolves.View on the film:Revealing during the in-depth Q&A after the screening that they had started working on the film seven years ago, the level of care co-writers/(with Jericca Cleland and Will Collins) co-directors Tomm Moore & Ross Stewart placed into the production,leads to a magical creation.Mentioning in the Q & A that Robyn was a boy in early drafts of the script, the change to Robyn being a girl by the writers, allows for intense drama from Robyn having to break through the barricades placed in front of her by the ruthless Lord Protector and her dad Bill,along with a emphasis on the fairy/folk tale aspect,of little red Robyn going deep into the mysterious woodland filled with wolves.Pointing out in the Q & A that they originally openly named the baddie Oliver Cromwell, the writers alteration to him being the ""Lord Protector"" (with English flags prominent in the background of shots) gives the villain a towering folk lore/ fairy tale menacing presence,who shoves away any who disagree,and confronts Robyn as a huge obstacle she must overcome to save the last wolves.Going to Ireland to kill the animal of the former Stark family symbol, Sean Bean gives a excellent turn as Bill,whose voice weighs heavy on daughter Robyn's pleas for him to help save the wolves, but is unable to shake a sense of duty towards the snarling Lord Protector.Walking into the wild woods to the lush chimes of Bruno Coulais's score and the whispering vocals of Folk group Kila, directors Moore and Stewart meet the wolves with mesmerising, shimmering pastel colour giving the hand-drawn animation the texture of having come straight from the pages of a old fairy/folk tale book.Detailing in the Q & A the inspection they got from 17th century wood carvings, the directors carve a eye-catching rustic, rough-edge stylised appearance, which gives Lord Protector pointed tough edges,as Robyn walks with the wolves.",Wolfwalkers
3,siderite,"If you loved Song of the Sea, you will like this, too",8,30 December 2020,"I started with Song of the Sea, then WolfWalkers. I wish I would have done it in reverse, because I do believe Song of the Sea is the superior movie: the characters more layered, the animation better and more beautiful, the story a bit nicer. Wolfwalkers is kind of the same thing in the sense that the protagonist is a young only child who has to push pass their overbearing father to define themselves as a person. Here the metaphors are more heavy handed, with the ultimate goal being more about gaining freedom than evolving as a person, but you get the beautiful animation, the celtic folklore, the nice Irish music and the hero's journey.I noticed other people comparing Tomm Moore's work with Miyazaki's and I concur that he kind of goes the same way: stories with a lot of national or traditional motifs, young children as heroes in very natural or magical environments going through a transformative journey that also tells things about us as people. Now I wonder if Breadwinner will be as good or not.",Wolfwalkers
4,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Wolfwalkers (2020) 7.3/10,7,3 November 2021,"""If the story is an agglomeration of Pixar's BRAVE (2012) and AVATAR (2009), salted with this particularly Irish myth (Bruno Coulais' exotic, folksy strains are the icing on the cake), Moore and Stewart truly deserve shout-outs for their strenuously crafty application. Richness, colorfulness and stimulating perspective perfuse every single frame, it is Studio Ghibli-level awesomeness on display, colors, shapes, patterns are intermingled into a sterling tapestry of vividness and delectation, a magical realm of excitement and sagacity.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.",Wolfwalkers
5,cherold,"stars pretty good, gets really good",8,5 March 2021,"I approached this movie with trepidation, as I had found the first of Cartoon Saloon's trilogy of Irish mythology films, Secret of Kells overrated - pretty but a structural mess.WolfWalkers is considerably better. The story involves a young girl, her father, and some mystical forest wolf people. The plot is straightforward and while Kells was an odd stew of Christianity and paganism, WolfWalkers has a clearly pagan vs. Christianity theme that makes more sense.The first half of the movie is cute but unexceptional, reasonably pretty but not stunning, outside of the fantastic, every flowing wolfpack and a wolf-girl's wild hair. But by the halfway point the story gets pretty intense and the animation becomes increasingly magical.I'd give the first half of this movie a 7 and the second half an 8, so I'm on the fence about what to rate the whole thing. I would say it's worth seeing, and I enjoyed it enough that I'll have to check out the other film in the trilogy, Song of the Sea.",Wolfwalkers
6,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Howling at the moon.,7,13 December 2020,"'Wolfwalkers (2020)' tells the tale of a young girl who discovers a magical mother and daughter who transform into wolves at night. Soon, she must help them avoid death at the hands of the English soldiers who are cutting down their forest and slaying their kin. It's a very traditional sort of story, one which hits almost every beat you'd expect it to. It also deals with themes of tolerance, friendship, peace and nature - again, all things you'd anticipate to find in a film of this kind. However, just because it deals with tropes doesn't meant it deals with them badly. It's an entertaining affair throughout. It's also beautifully animated and has a gloriously hand-crafted aesthetic. It's an enjoyable and visually distinct experience from beginning to end. 7/10",Wolfwalkers
7,Cineanalyst,"Behold, Meaningful Animation",8,3 May 2021,"Of course ""Wolfwalkers"" lost the race for the Animated Feature Oscar; it's the better movie. The award winner, ""Soul"" is dualistic spirituality focus-grouped into non-offensiveness--the product of a mere foot soldier (Pixar) within the enclosed medieval and fairytale-inspired land (Disney) where any mythology deemed too dangerous is hoped to be kept hidden in the forest outside their walls. Oh, sure, they'll send a hunter outside once in a while, cut down some of the trees for in house and maybe even threaten to raze the entire forest down, but the overriding religion is to keep the market of townies safe within their cage of managed doctrine. Making a movie about the afterlife and ignoring millennia of religious history doesn't matter to them in the same way that traditional animation is irrelevant to their 3D-computerized eye. The townies may be forgiven, then, when they choose their cage over the threat of a pagan mythos that engages in a battle between that doctrine and magic, where character duality has meaning, and the animation is inspired by the past--not merely adopting, say, Cubism devoid of its original context just because it has a pleasant appearance. That's fluff; this is not.""Wolfwalkers"" looks and sounds better, too--at least if one isn't looking to see the same CGI passed off as animation over and over again and isn't impressed that after four decades Pixar realized that African Americans are part of their market, too, and so put in a jazz score (OK, the score is good, I admit)--plus the supposed humor of a white woman's voice in a black man's body. None of that's even about race, or anything really besides a corporatist and a cafeterian religious soup of generalities on the meaning of life. There very well is a point, however, to the half-human, half-wolf eponymous wolfwalkers here: aesthetic, environmental, historical, national and spiritual. Cromwellian English civilizing in the form of a religious war and ecological destruction on the Irish folklore and landscape. No mere two different-looking worlds, this is a land where the two sides not only look different, one gray and the other lustrous; they literally see the same world differently. It's also one where the overall aesthetic of traditional animation takes its cue from a deeper past such as of woodcut painting and Celtic calligraphy. Even the alternating frame of the images matter. This cannot be produced in a cage; it requires a wild freedom.",Wolfwalkers
8,Reno-Rangan,Wolf wolf howls the wolf.,8,12 December 2020,"Tomm Moore, one of the best animation filmmakers we've right now, probably all time, just behind Hayao Miyazaki. A fine end to the trilogy, that's beautifully told stories of the Irish fairytales.If you loved Previous two, you'll love it as well. As usual the animation was impressive. Who makes 2D animation in the today's world. So it's a treasure. And the 2021 Oscars nod should be a must, otherwise the ceremony has no value. And unlike previous two Oscars nods, this time hopefully it wins. Fingers crossed.The music was too beautifully blended with the storytelling. A movie for all age groups and a must see. I'm already waiting for the next film from the director. Before that, I'm gonna rewatch it a couple more times, or even more.",Wolfwalkers
9,briancham1994,Cartoon Saloon's best film,9,12 January 2021,"This is Cartoon Saloon's best film to date, honing all their skills exercised in The Secret of Kells onwards. It combines the storybook-style 2D animation, Irish mythological references, overbearing authority figures, city walls and (of course) wolf invasions. There are also other influences deftly woven into this film from Disney and Studio Ghibli. It follows a range of brilliantly distinct and animated characters through a visually evocative landscape with a tense, thrilling plot that will engage the viewer from beginning to end, with particular emphasis on the wolf sense scenes.",Wolfwalkers
10,matthewssilverhammer,A Masterpiece,10,16 January 2021,"Wolfwalkers is the most beautiful film of 2020; Moore's unmistakable style is surprising & intricate in ways most animation doesn't even try. Thankfully, it's more than a pretty face; it's a unique vision of narrow-minded bigotry & the dangers of religiously-justified imperialism. The brave grace with which it handles the lack of systemic shifts, instead focusing on the individual changes, is moving & honest. In a year with 2 Pixar films, this is the best family film of 2020.",Wolfwalkers
11,marmar-69780,WolfWalkers,8,14 December 2020,WolfWalkers is at least until Soul comes out the best animated film of the year and i must say that this movie has a very sweet story of friendship in it and its messages are very clear and strong.The best thing about film was animation that was very different from anything that we are getting now days from big studios like Pixar and others and because of that i recommend this film if you are willing to accept something different and fresh.Story was also very good and it showed how we also need to treat nature and animals with care,Wolfwalkers
12,southdavid,Fang-Tastic,8,21 December 2020,"The last movie on Apple TV that I hadn't seen (at the time of writing) was ""Wolfwalkers"" that arrived on the app with a bit of a splash at the end of 2020. It's a terrific animated movie, produced in Ireland, with great story telling and an interesting visual style.Robin (Honor Kneafsey) and her father Bill (Sean Bean) have arrived in Kilkenny in 1650. Bill is a hunter and has been charged by the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell (Simon McBurney) with killing the Wolves in the surrounding woods that are being felled for expansion of the town. Robin is eager to help, but a series of circumstances lead to her being alone in the woods, where she meets Mebh (Eva Whittaker) a girl of similar age who can transform into a wolf and who leads the pack.It really is a wonderful film to look at. The animation style is at times brilliantly abstract whilst astonishingly detailed at others. The sharp lines of the characters stand out nicely against watercolour-esque backgrounds - it is truly beautiful. It's a decent story too. It's definitely a children's film, the plot is pretty basic and there are clear lines between good and evil of the film even as peoples motivations turn, but it's sincerely a children's film, there are no winking nods or visual gags to try and placate a family that might be seeing the film together. It's a very earnest story, and it's not difficult to draw parallels between the townsfolk expanding into the forest and the English army's occupation of Ireland.Vocal performances are really good too. The two young girls are excellent. Sean Bean puts quite a lot into his performance (admittedly stoic man from South Yorkshire ought to come rather easily by now). The world building foley work and the score are excellent too. If you want any criticism, maybe it might have been made clearer that the fate of Oliver Cromwell isn't entirely accurate, but that really is nitpicking.Even if we hadn't had the year in film that 2020 was ""Wolfwalkers"" has to be the front runner for the animated film Oscar.",Wolfwalkers

14,lisafordeay,Hooray hand drawn animation is back,9,27 October 2020,"Wolfwalkers is a 2020 Irish animated film and tells the story of an english hunter(Sean Bean) and his daughter Robyn (Honor Kneafsey from A Christmas Prince) who traveled to Kilkenny in Ireland from England and they are set to kill the last of the wolf pack as they are wolfwalkers. However Robyn befriends a young girl named Maeve(Eva Whittaker)who transforms into a wolf and bites Robyn who also turns into a wolf. Will Robyn protect Maeve and her clan?. The animation is gorgeous, the story is very good and the story was also very good even though we have seen this type of story before e.g. Pocahontas,Brave,How To Train Your Dragon.Overall I loved this film as I have a friend who begged me to see this film and I finally got to see it before it was released in December.If you love Brave and How To Train Your Dragon then you are gonna love this.

In fact, this is the third of an Irish trilogy-each story is different so it's not just one long tale-with the other two being 'The Secret of Kells'_2009 & 'Song of the Sea'_2014. This one is about a hunter, Sean, and his daughter, Honor, that hunt a pack of wolves that are actually wolfwalkers-aka, werewolves-on the edge of their village. Honor is a young girl so she is still in training. Eva plays a wolfwalker that befriends Honor after having an awkward altercation with her in the woods. Simon is the village leader that wants to eliminate all the wolves completely because he considers them beasts of Satan. The art is a little different from what you usually get from Disney but it does kind of grow on you.It's rated ""PG"" for violence, peril, scary images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes.I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Wolfwalkers

Disguise opened wide
There is nowhere for you to hide
The hunter's moon is shining
I'm running with the wolves tonight""
(Aurora / Running with the Wolves)'Wolfwalkers' is yet another deliciously intoxicating cine-potion brewed by the wise druid of contemporary animation Tomm Moore. Every frame of his third feature has so much love and soul poured into it, that it is impossible not to admire the hyper-stylized character & background designs, absolutely brilliant use of colors and that 'medieval illustration meet a picture book' disregard for perspective that evokes the sense of childlike wonder within the viewer. Moore creates as if performing a pagan ritual that is supposed to awaken ancient spirits who will guide you into a magical and mysterious world you never knew existed...Cartoon Saloon's best film, on basically every level. The most beautiful, the most character-focused animation, the most narratively and dramatically compelling, the most interested in exploring the disastrous and monstrous history of English colonialism. I have liked every Cartoon Saloon film so far, but this is just next level.",Wolfwalkers

Set in 1650 in Kilkenny, Ireland and the woods near the town. Cromwell has occupied the area and is having the trees cut back, the wolves attack the tree cutters but the wolfwalkers try to mediate. A tale of the daughter of an English wolf hunter meeting up with a girl who is a wolfwalker. A friendship develops to the background of the occupation and the war between wolves and mankind.

An Apple TV original nominated for best animated and honestly that's all I really knew about it before turning it on and I'm pretty happy about that. This was a really surprising, touching, heartfelt film about... Wooo Boy is it about a lot. There are so many layers and ideas here that all interlock themselves so beautifully. Ideas of independence, growing up, parenting, duty, destiny, freedom, an the magic of nature all so well balanced and portrayed. Visually it's stunning. WolfWakers employs an art style that feels like such a breath of fresh air compared to the often cookie cutter animations we see these days. It even feels like it has an edge over the oft lauded Pixar just based on it's sheer originality.Honestly, I'm so glad this got a nomination because I don't know that I would've ever watched it otherwise and I would have been missing out. This is a wonderful movie for adults and children alike and 100% deserves to be checked out by people. Chalk another great one up for Apple TV, they are really making a name for themselves lately it feels like and I love it.",Wolfwalkers
22,jadepietro,Visually Stunning Artistry Afoot,9,15 February 2021,"IN BRIEF: A beautifully hand-drawn animated wonder that deals with serious subjects and never panders to its audience.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Cartoon Saloon, an up-and coming studio in Ireland, has created a beautiful piece of art called Wolfwalkers, a cautionary tale about two young girl fighting against a harsh adult world. Set in the mid-1600's, cities are expanding into the forest regions and have upset the ecological cycle. Wolves are attacking its residents and law has been declared against their pack. Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) starts out her self-enlightening journey as a huntress with a crossbow, akin to her hunter father (Sean Bean). Along the way, she befriends Mebh (Eva Whittaker), a shape-shifting feral wolf-child, and their friendship begins to convert her thinking.Skillfully directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart (The Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea), Wolfwalkers is a visual treat. The third chapter of their trilogy completes their thematic set about historical Irish fore lore, although each film stands alone on its own merits. In this latest installment, the characters are drawn with angular lines and heavy contours, set against stylized flat backgrounds of geometric medieval buildings that look like woodblock prints, or lush watercolored enchanted forests that swirl with vivid spontaneous hues that truly do enchant. The contrast is never jarring and compliments the characters and actions. The ever-changing color palette of oranges versus blues, cold grey blues and hints of amber, rustic reds against purple tints is stunning. There is so much creativity and innovation in their filmmaker's artistic choices.Some minor flaws do exist in all of the film's glory: The plot does meander and one can easily guess the outcome. Screenwriter Wil Collins does allow some scenes to go on a wee too long, my laddie, and overstates its ecological and political messaging about colonialism, authority, and religion in his storytelling. But that's a lot to cover in any movie, be it live-action or animated. Voiceover work is good, although the sometimes heavy Irish accents also are a minor inconvenience if not an authentic addition to the story. (Still the character of Mebh could have been tempered as she tends to annoy rather than endear.)Yet, both adults and children will be thoroughly captivated by this film. The end result is a gorgeously rendered example of painstakingly hand-drawn animation, a rarity these days in the field of computer animated wizardry, Also the film's Celtic score by Bruno Coulais and Kila provides the perfect atmosphere. There is a lovely fantasy interlude complete with a rousing tune called Running with the Wolves that is quite memorable in its perfect blending of both sound and imagery. The use of split screen techniques to convey contrasting views of events works quite effectively too.The issue of fear of change and intolerance is at the core of this film, but, fortunately, the artisans involved in the making of Wolfwalkers are a fearless and imaginative lot. Kudos to them...and us moviegoers for the opportunity to experience their joy! (GRADE: B+)",Wolfwalkers

24,nancyldraper,Beautiful artistry,9,30 December 2020,"Beautiful animation.

25,arungeorge13,A visual extravaganza that tells a compelling story! [+84%],8,13 December 2020,"With an engaging core story (based on the aftermath of the Irish civil war), characters worth rooting for, and brilliant visuals, Wolfwalkers proves to be one of the most satisfying (animated) film experiences of the year. If you thought only Disney, Pixar, Laika, or Studio Ghibli could set such high standards for animated films, Cartoon Saloon is here to solidify its presence with a fascinating fourth entry. The story is narrated in the simplest way possible, supplemented by stunning hand-drawn imagery and compelling voice-overs. A young Irish girl (voiced by Honor Kneafsey) befriends a WolfWalker, eventually turns into one, and then sides with the wolfpack in an attempt to save them from a colonial overlord and his henchmen. From a storyline standpoint, that's more than sufficient. But Wolfwalkers is SO MUCH MORE!Sean Bean voices the little girl's father, torn between wanting a good life for his daughter and following the orders of the Lord Protector, the villainous Oliver Cromwell (Simon McBurney, effective). At times, the plot gets a bit formulaic, but Wolfwalkers manages to evoke genuinely strong emotions out of its viewers. Even if the plot doesn't move you entirely, the visuals certainly will. The way the town and the forest have been envisioned, stylized, and designed is nothing short of outstanding (the 'wolf-vision' bits are magical!). The perfection here lies in its broad brushstrokes and woodcuts, something that pure CGI often lacks.Directed by Cartoon Saloon co-founder Tomm More (who previously received Oscar nods for The Secret of Kells and Song of The Sea) with ample support from art director Ross Stewart, Wolfwalkers brings back the old-school feels of flipping pages in a timeless fable. It's for kids, it's for adults, it's for EVERYONE! Thematically, Wolfwalkers tackles the subjects of opposition-free authority, friendship, family, and to a large extent, ecology. Where it stands out lies in the fact that it does so, in a beautifully profound fashion.",Wolfwalkers

28,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Perhaps the best entry in the ""Irish Folklore Trilogy.""",9,22 June 2021,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch the third installment in Tomm Moore's ""Irish Folklore Trilogy."" The Secret of Kells (2009) was a unique animation style that also carried over to Song of the Sea (2014). Wolfwalkers (2020) continues this ""rough"" visual style but perhaps has the strongest story of all three films. That's not to say its predecessors don't have interesting stories, it's more that Wolfwalkers builds upon the foundations established by these previous entries of this loose trilogy.As is the case with these films, Wolfwalkers follows a young girl (Robyn Goodfellowe (Honor Kneafsey)) who encounters the fantasy of the world adjacent to her own. Both The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea andShapeshifting wolves and disappearing forests are more complex than she first realizes. Many stories based on ancient lore are meant to teach lessons to children, and this movie is no different. Granted, there are quite a few cliches in how the plot progresses, being quite predictable at times. Still, the story is engaging enough to warrant a viewing.This movie first came to my attention when I saw it tied to advertisements for Apple TV+. As this is yet another streaming service on top of the ones already well established (and with significantly more content than Apple TV+ has), I was disappointed that such a marvelous, Oscar-nominated film like Wolfwalkers was basically trapped behind a paywall. I don't know if this movie will ever be released on Blu-ray, but for right now I'd suggest dipping your toe into Apple TV+ with a free trial just to watch this one piece of content.Perhaps the best entry in the ""Irish Folklore Trilogy,"" I give Wolfwalkers 4.5 stars out of 5.",Wolfwalkers

As an animation, this movie was beautiful and visually entertaining. The style was not as realistic as in a studio Ghibli film, but it's unique and worked well with the film. The characters in the movie were pretty good. The main girl who came to Ireland felt like she was trapped in the town, and felt free when she was in the forest. This was portrayed as difference in color tone between the town and the forest. The town looked monotonous and gray, while the forest was filled with bright and lively color. I also liked the movie showing the people in town as fearful and dangerous by drawing their teeth in a nasty way. The main story reminded me a bit of Princess Mononoke as both had a character that met a wild character who could communicate with wolves. However, the story here was still different enough to enjoy.

Its hard to think of things that were lesser. Only maybe that it sometimes tries a little too hard to be whimsical, but that is really picking the nits. So this is by far my favourite film made by this studio.8/10: yes.",Wolfwalkers
33,msbreviews,WOLFWALKERS is 2D animation at its best. One of the best films of the year.,9,7 December 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I've always been a tremendous fan of animation. If there's one comment I deeply despise is the ""animated films are for children"". This preconceived notion is extremely dated, and honestly, quite childish. I don't even think it works within a teenage banter anymore since anime keeps growing exponentially around the world, and animated movies are reaching more and more people as time goes by. The whole ""you watch cartoons, you're a baby"" bullying statement to make friends laugh about someone is now decades-old. However, I still feel a bit of pity for people who believe animation can't have the same emotional impact than live-action, especially when a major studio like Pixar is known for making the most grown-up of adults cry like an infant.In addition to this, some viewers think that the latter studio owned by Disney is the only company making decent animated flicks when they've been losing ground to other unbelievably talented people. One of my favorite animated films of all-time is Kubo and the Two Strings, a stop-motion animation work from Laika, the studio that also created Missing Link and Coraline. Cartoon Saloon is emerging as an awards-contender studio, by releasing movies such as Song of the Sea, The Breadwinner, and now Wolfwalkers. The main difference between this last company and the others is the style of animation: the ""old"" 2D animation that 90s kids like me grew up with.That's precisely where I'm starting this review. Wolfwalkers' 2D animation proves once again that this style will never become ""dated"" or ""less than"" the current 3D design. Don't be mistaken, I love both styles! I'm not part of the whole 2D vs 3D discourse simply because I firmly believe both have their own benefits and limitations. 2D animation brings a sense of uniqueness and artistry to any story due to the distinct drawing from many skilled artists, but it's more limited than 3D when it comes to creating an immersive atmosphere and its respective world. However, the latter is becoming stagnated in its design structure since almost every 3D animated flick visually feels and looks the same.So, there's no good or bad, right or wrong, better or worse when it comes to animation. I can offer dozens of examples of exceptional, gorgeous-looking, utterly superb animated flicks from both styles, as well as awful, corporate-like films that I try my hardest to forget (looking at you, The Emoji Movie). Fortunately, Wolfwalkers belongs to the first group. Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart direct an emotionally heartwarming tale with seamless execution of every single aspect. Will Collins' screenplay isn't particularly new or innovative though. It follows a somewhat generic, predictable story with key plot points that any viewer with minimum viewing experience will see coming from miles away.However, it's a formula that, if executed properly, still delivers a rich, passionate, captivating narrative, which will always please both children and adults. Just from the premise, it's pretty clear that the message of the movie is inspired by cliches such as ""don't judge people by their cover"" or ""our wants can steal someone else's needs"", and it even approaches racial discrimination since the film deals with two different populations. Obviously, having in mind one of these ""societies"" is a pack of wolves, there's also a message towards deforestation and excessive animal hunting, leading thousands of species to their eventual extinction. All of these themes are handled brilliantly, and it never feels preachy.It doesn't matter how unsurprising the story ends up being when I feel as absorbed by the characters and the animation as I did. Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker, as Robyn Goodfellowe and Mebh Óg MacTíre respectively, display phenomenal voice work, which is then elevated by the stunning, expressive, award-worthy animation. Sean Bean is also terrific as Bill Goodfellowe, Robyn's father, who basically possesses the character arc that goes through the significant change of acknowledging, understanding, and accepting an entirely different culture and its people (in this case, animals). Every character is incredibly well-written as are all dialogues, surrounded by a Celtic-inspired atmosphere, myths, and obviously, music.Bruno Coulais and folk group Kíla developed the movie's original score, and it's undoubtedly one of my favorite soundtracks of 2020, including one of my favorite original songs (""Running with the Wolves"") in one of my favorite musical sequences of the year. ""Favorite"" is definitely the right one-word description of how I feel about Wolfwalkers. It's one of those films I can't really point out a single flaw. Massive praise to the drawing artists who designed such a fantastic 2D world. Their work is often unappreciated and underrated (besides being underpaid), so I want to offer Cartoon Saloon my biggest thank you, and keep making excellent cinema.I have no doubts: Wolfwalkers is, by far and so far, the best animated feature-film I've seen all year. I know the big gun from Pixar is coming up (Soul), but it will have to be an absolutely perfect movie to surpass Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart's beautifully heartwarming Celtic-inspired tale. Cartoon Saloon continues to prove that 2D animation is still capable of delivering emotionally compelling stories through gorgeous-looking, unique, artistic drawings. Despite Will Collins's generic narrative and cliche messages, every single detail is executed perfectly, without a single flaw to point out. Outstanding voice work from Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker as the well-written, captivating protagonists. However, it's Bruno Coulais and Kíla's original score that melts my heart and sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. One of my favorite films of the year, I'd be extremely surprised with myself if it doesn't end on my Top10. Watch it with your family. It's worth it.Rating: A",Wolfwalkers

35,elicopperman,Elegant Epic based on Irish Fairy Tales,10,19 December 2020,"Acclaimed Irish studio Cartoon Saloon has been one of the most revolutionary animation houses across the globe. Not only have their films grown in critical and audience favorability, but the artistic achievements they've utilized through Irish folklore and complex fantasy tales (besides The Breadwinner) are worthy of rivaling the competition. So it's no surprise that their most recent effort Wolfwalkers, directed by studio co-founder Tom Moore and Secret of Kells art director Ross Stewart, has been getting rave responses since its promotion on Apple TV. And having finally seen it, I can safely say that the praise is thoroughly deserved.Set in mid 17th century Ireland, a young girl named Robyn Goodfellowe lives in the secluded town of Kilkenney with her father, who hunts the town's enemy of wolves. Upon confronting a mysterious creature in the wolfpack named Mebh, Robyn sets out to protect the pack from the antagonistic general, Oliver Cromwell. From a premise like that, one would expect somewhat of an environmental themed flick, but Wolfwalkers has so much more to offer than just its message of preserving nature instead of harming it for one's own development. As the film is a character driven piece dissecting the mythos of wolfwalkers, who are mainly fantasy-esque versions of people in the nighttime who have been bitten by wolves, the strongest element of the film is the obstacle Robyn faces in trying to save Mebh and the wolfpack despite the severely strict orders Cromwell elicates on the Kilkenney natives, let alone her father. In many ways, the film shows the positive and negative aspects about trying to protect one species yet also having to preserve your original human form.Beyond the complex storyline, the tone of the movie is a good balance of light hearted childlike whimsy and foreboding dark stakes. The scenes showcasing Robyn around the townspeople, among Mebh and her wolf pack, are appropriately charming and fun to watch, as if we're experiencing what it was once like to be as wild and free as a child. But then, whenever there are serious consequences Robyn has to face from Cromwell or her father, the film can go from mildly heartbreaking to intensely devastating. Any guessing of what could happen to Robyn, Mebh or even her father is completely unpredictable, and the film always knows how to keep the suspense rising so that the audience can feel up to the edge of their seats. If there's only one slight criticism to give the film, and even then it's more of a question than a complaint, it's that the ending is concise but also a little too short. While it does wrap the film up very well, it might have been a little more satisfying to see a slightly longer conclusion to the Goodfellowe's epic tale. But then again, less is more, so all's well that ends well.Out of all the films Cartoon Saloon has produced, this one might be their most stylized and technologically advanced one to date. In addition to the characters having ancient Galic designs to make them look more visually distinctive from real humans, their movements are precisely smooth and crisp while still keeping their general acting as clear as possible. Beyond that, the backgrounds are gorgeously detailed with so much emphasis on the cultural reference in old Irish tales, and the effects work is breathtaking, especially when it comes to the wolf running sequences. It's even great when the film uses its minimal yet strong color palettes and layouts to let a specific shot speak for itself. Also, not only does the voice acting feel so real and authentic to both the time period and the character's emotions, but the music score by Bruno Coulais and Kila adds in to the quaint albeit dynamic atmosphere of the feature. You almost never get the same type of cultural and artistic experience out of movies like this, so it's amazing when filmmakers allow audiences to indulge in their worlds as much as they can.So in short, Wolfwalkers is an elegant fairy tale of a feature with many complex philosophies, engaging characters, breathtaking visuals and music and stellar acting to go along with it. If you're yet to check out this marvelous gem of a film, by all means do so whenever you can. In a day and age where streaming services are slowly but surely releasing unique content that you don't get from the mainstream anymore, films like I Lost my Body, If Anything Happens I Love You and Wolfwalkers are prime examples as how the art of animated filmmaking are just as strong as it's always been, if not more.",Wolfwalkers
36,trinaboice,Gorgeous and magical,10,22 November 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
If you love all-things-Irish, Renaissance festivals, as well as Studio Ghibli, this Apple Original film looks and feels like a lovely combination of all of those things. Add the voice of Sean Bean. Yes, please! This magical animation is from the Academy Award-nominated makers of The Secret of Kells AND Song of the Sea and based on Irish folklore. It was directed by Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart, becoming the first animated feature to be nominated for ""Best International Feature"" at the Gotham Awards. The film is dedicated to Mark Stewart, who passed away this year. Cartoon Saloon continues to pump out beautiful animation films that are pretty close to visual masterpieces.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This is a perfect family-friendly film that all ages can enjoy.
Wolves attack people. People attack wolves.
You might need to talk to young children about magic and imagination.THEMES:
Friendship
Courage
Tolerance
Humans vs. nature
Family
Female empowerment
The creators of the film explained that colonialism was the real villain in the story in that it separated protagonists from nature.THINGS I LIKED:
The concept art is absolutely beautiful and mesmerizing. It's refreshing to see two-dimensional and under-appreciated hand-drawn animation. The colors and geometric shapes are extremely enchanting, making each frame a piece of art to be studied. One of my sons is a 3D animation artist at Blizzard and he has taught me to really appreciate the mastery of hand-drawn animation.
You really get a sense of Ireland in the 1600s
You can almost feel how damp the green forest is in animation.
Visually, the movie also illustrates the cage women of that day might have felt they were in. There are lots of angles and big black lines that represent society's rules that trapped Robyn, the young heroin in the story.
Honor Kneafsey voices the enthusiastic Robyn Goodfellowe and does a fantastic job.Eva Whittaker lends her spunky voice to Mdbh Og MacTire.
The humor is both visual and spoken.
The British and Irish accents of the characters are super cute.
If you love the artistry in this film, you might also want to check out:
The story features the stark contrast between the magic of nature and that of the Lord Protector's rigid religious fervor. The film's creators explained that the type of Puritan religion that Lord Cromwell brought to Christianity emphasized man over nature, instead of a balance between the two: domination vs. submission. Whenever the story spotlights what's happening in the forest, the colors are light and green; to show the duality of thinking at the time, the city scenes feature grey tones in the color palette.
Clever framing devices.
The film knows when to be silent to let the audience bask in the beauty.
I loved the scene that shows Mebh Og practically melting on Robyn's lap while she gets her hair brushed by her new human friend. So sweet.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The father shows warmth to his daughter but he never listens to her.
I hate it when religious people in movies are shown as truly terrible people.INTERESTING LINES:
""Work is prayer, girl."" - Head Housekeeper (Nora Twomey)
""I prayed the whole Bible."" - Robyn Goodfellowe (Honor Kneafsey)
""We must do what we're told."" - Bill (Sean Bean) ""Why? - Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) ""I'm afraid."" - Bill (Sean Bean)You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel and website.",Wolfwalkers
37,sweidman-28016,No Words to Describe How Beautiful This Is,8,28 October 2020,"""The woods is getting smaller everyday.""I can guarantee it right now, this will be the most underrated animated film of the year, or even in the past decade or so. With big name films that Disney produces, it's hard to remember there are other studios making animated films just as great or even better. Wolfwalkers falls under this category. Like the other films from this studio, it focuses of Irish tales and folklore. Song of the Sea amazed me when I watched it only a couple years ago. Wolfwalkers is just as amazing and some may even say better than Song of the Sea. I'm not apart of that group but it's a really close call. The animation is the first thing that caught my eye. This is the most beautifully animated film in years. The autumn colors look beautiful on screen. And with the style they use has so much details. And I loved looking at the patterns within. I'm not the person to talk to about animation since I'm no artist, but all I can say is that it is just stunning.The story feels sort of familiar in ways, but is done well. The predictability factor, typically in animated films aimed for children, isn't too strong. But I wouldn't even go to it being aimed towards children. As lore, I feel that this is for everybody. I felt engaged the whole time. There's always something exciting or interesting happening on screen. The characterization isn't as strong for everyone, more towards the main antagonist, but by the end you feel connected with these characters. The voice acting is all good. The two main characters couldn't have been better voice-casted (if that's a word). Overall I'm just thoroughly pleased with this film. I don't know how to describe everything else without giving anything away, but all I can say is this should be a must watch for everyone this year. It'll be on AppleTV+ later this year I believe so check it out if you can.",Wolfwalkers
38,fciocca,Loved the animation style and characters. Maybe a little bit predictable toward the end.,9,20 May 2021,"""WolfWalkers"" is a rare gem, and I am glad that I have watched it. I enjoyed the animation that I have found stunning and truly different. In an era of 3D and photorealistic graphics, it is good to come back once in a while to something that is hand drawn. The style used deep dive in this magic world on the Irish folklore culture. I loved the color palette, I have really enjoyed locations and the whole setting. I am happy that there are still studios that are willing to take huge risks, in order to deliver something unique. Congratulations to Apple that distributed this piece of art. We need more movies like this one, please.The medieval-like soundtrack perfectly matches with the mood and the story. There are a few tracks that mix perfectly the tradition of old popular music, with modern lyrics. I went immediately to search for the tracklist and I am absolutely stunned by the work done.Every element in this movie immersed me in this fairy tale and I was totally invested on the plot. The story is not very original to be fair, but it is simple and straightforward. Everyone can watch this movie and feel entertained, it has a nice development: nothing feels out of place or dragged out. There is a nice buildup and a lot of tension. It is very dynamic, but not too violent. ""WolfWalkers"" is one of the best animation movies of 2020, in my opinion, and it earned completely 9 stars out of 10.",Wolfwalkers

It is about a girl who lives in a village who tries to destroy a forest but cannot because a pack of wolves threatens them and in the process she discovers unsuspected things.
Quality.
Entertaining
In 2D with wonderful colors.
The script is wonderful.
Set in the Middle Ages as a metaphor for the medieval thoughts that we have.
It shows the relationship of man with nature and how he feels the owner of everything to possess and destroy.
He talks about the prejudices that put us in our heads, about the moments in which we discover the truth, about the innate curiosity of the human being, about compassion and putting ourselves in the place of the other.

42,patriciogl10,An outstanding stylized effort.,10,25 June 2021,"This monumental feature is proof enough that amazing feats can be done in this day and age regarding 2D animation. The highly crafted visual style reminiscing of children's book flows extremely well with a heart-warming story that resonates deep within and takes the viewer back to a time in Ireland where authorities still ruled with an iron fist, fixated on getting rid of such majestic creatures of the forest as wolves are.The legend of the Wolfwalkers comes alive in such an awe-inspiring manner, thanks to the impeccable efforts from the folks at Cartoon Saloon whose animated style has become a trademark of theirs, contrasting harshly with the nowadays standard 3D animated releases out there. Not only does its distinct illustrative style come off as a standout element, but the story that it accompanies is absolutely enchanting, much so that one cannot help but to feel immersed in the world inhabited by Robin, Mebh and her pack of wolves, wrapped up in an intriguing tale of Irish folklore and fantastic fables.Wolfwalkers is definitely one of the best animated films in recent times, and proof of the mesmerizing growth of animation studio Cartoon Saloon, with a consistent output of high quality features for over a decade now. Here's to more from them!",Wolfwalkers
43,TheCorniestLemur,Irish Princess Mononoke,8,23 July 2021,"The best pun I could come up with for this was ""Princess Potatoke"".Cause if you've seen Princess Mononoke, you will definitely be thinking about it a lot while watching this. And oh god, is it Irish. It's so Irish that, being English, if I wanted to review this fairly, I had to fight back decades of colonialist instinct thanks to Boris trying his damnedest to bring it back.As you might guess from my opening statement, my biggest issue with this is that occasionally, it can feel a bit ""been there, done that"". I for one would be stunned if Princess Mononoke wasn't a pretty big inspiration for this, but the film also plays it maybe a little bit too safe for my liking in general. It feels like it's slightly pushing the label of ""kids' film"" at points, and I think it would have been cool to see it take that just a little bit further.But everything else...well, let's start with the obvious. The animation is just *chef's kiss* gorgeous, and the fact that this studio is one of the last holdouts seemingly dedicated to 2D animation in a time where even Ghibli is giving CGI some flirtatious looks is enough to make me want to sail over to Ireland right now and bring them a pot of gold. The line work, the backgrounds, the character design, the matte paintings, the style in general, the fact that it made first person wolf running scenes leagues above Bram Stoker's Dracula, everything about this film is ravishing to the eyes.The performances are great, even the 12 and 8 year olds that play the two leads...actually, scratch that, especially the 12 and 8 year olds that play the two leads. They bring so much heart and charm to these characters that it's honestly hard to imagine them any other way. Sean Bean is the best he's been probably since Game Of Thrones, and Simon McBurney (that's one hell of a fitting name) just has such a punchable voice. It's great for this role.The story, while it can be a little derivative, has really good and meaningful choices throughout it, that I can't really explain without spoiling, it's directed amazingly well, playing with different animation styles, aspect ratios, and in general there's just some well thought out shots, and oh man the soundtrack. I always thought the original version of Running With The Wolves sounded way too overproduced, and I'm glad someone apparently agreed with me, because the simpler, more folky version of it here is beautiful.And whether I would have preferred this to win over Soul? Well...I'm not sure which one I prefer at this moment, but...come on, Pixar have won enough times by now. That's all I'm saying.",Wolfwalkers
44,TheVictoriousV,An enthralling escape into the Celtic unknown,9,20 December 2020,"The latest from Cartoon Saloon (The Secret of Kells, The Breadwinner, et al), Wolfwalkers is such a magical surprise and so completely in its own world that you surely won't mind its occasional Disney-Pixar similarities - even if the things that come to mind involve bits of folklore and myth that predate both Disney's films and the fairy tales they were based on. Nevertheless, it is the animation you deserve in the month that gave us Bobbleheads.Wolfwalkers is a hand-drawn Irish film, with story and mythology that may recall Pixar's Brave (which did a far worse job at being its own thing), and animation that occasionally looks flat and almost unfinished. However, this is not a bad thing.The movie looks like Fantasy sketches, old watercolor paintings, and sometimes even petroglyphs brought to life; the obviously penciled lines and still-visible sketching circles simply function as a flex (on top of ultimately creating a unique yet aptly old-fashioned art style), reminding us of the painstaking process and imagination behind the film. These details are akin to the thumbprints we sometimes see on claymation characters. The thematic shifts in color, lighting, framing, and ""squiggliness"" also help it stand out.Additional magic is supplied on the soundtrack; Irish singer Kíla gives Bruno Couilas' score that extra Gaelic touch, and there is also an original tune by Aurora, the Nordic singer whose angelic vocals appeared in Frozen 2. There's even a tinge of A Song of Ice and Fire, but this one makes a warg-like connection to nature seem decidedly more pleasant.We join Robyn (Honor Kneafsey), an English girl in an Irish village, yearning for a more exciting life. Her father Goodfellowe (Sean Bean) helps defend the village from wolves, said by some farmers to be under the spell of ""wolfwalkers"" - wild humans who can unleash their spirit animals if need be. The ruthless Lord Protector (Simon McBurney) dismisses the idea as Pagan superstition, but free-spirited Robyn encounters Mebh Óg MacTíre (Eva Whittaker), a feral but quick-witted wolfwalker who gives Princess Merida's hair a run for its money.The friendship between the two children is the heart of the film; Robyn finally finds belonging, eventually learning to ""see"" with all her senses the way wolfwalkers do, and Mebh gradually warms up to ""townies"". The voice acting is remarkably good, proving that child performers can, in the right circumstances, be some of the best actors we have. The imaginations of children can go a long way, and many would jump at the idea of getting to communicate with the beasts of the Celtic wild, or pretend that they do. Sure enough, these actors seem to be having a blast.What makes Wolfwalkers extra important, especially if the COVID situation allows it to technically be one of the most popular animated movies of the year, is that it proves it isn't over for 2D animation. With major releases on hold (unless even more studios start to realize the perks of streaming), more and more viewers will be forced to look in new, less obvious places, to possibly find films that they love in ways they didn't know films could be loved. Cartoon Saloon might just be the place.And indeed, much like last year's Klaus, this one feels very much like a journey back to the sort of films Disney would no longer agree to make (a reminder that becomes outright depressing when you learn that Kirk Wise worked on the aforementioned Bobbleheads film). It doesn't visually resemble any Disney movie - or any other animated film that I can recall - in the way that Klaus looked like something from the era of Treasure Planet and The Emperor's New Groove, but it carries a certain magic we could all use.",Wolfwalkers

After watching this, I can safely say, NO! This is nowhere near that film. This film has an interesting plot which made me believe the hype. Also the animation intrigued me quite a bit, so decided to watch it. After watching it, all I can say is that while the plot is interesting, the screenplay is quite dull. I was bored to death watching this. I somehow managed to finish it somehow without skipping any of it. I was about to fall asleep before which a song came on that kept me from dozing off. The characters are no where as interesting as I thought them to be. The girl is whinnying throughout the film and the father is the most annoying character I've come across. It was too annoying to watch. There's no humour in this film. Some silly little shenanigans here and there which may or may not make kids laugh. For a kids film this is a 6. There are much better stories out there for kids and this is not at all that interesting. For an adult film this is a 0. Unbearable and annoying.This one can be easily skipped.

46,sirwillisiv,An engaging Celtic fairytale with breathtaking animation...,9,4 March 2021,"Please watch Wolfwalkers, an animated film from Cartoon Saloon, an Irish studio. This isn't your typical animated fare. This is strictly an arthouse picture where the visuals and mood motivate the story. It's more bold and serene than the mainstream. Very in tune with the Studio Ghibli films, if that's a better analogy for some.Fueled by emotion, Wolfwalkers is a Celtic fairytale with breathtaking colors and animation, a glamorous mythology and plucky characters with a true, lovable chemistry. I felt a strong, genuine connection radiating between the father and daughter, as well as the daughter and the wolfwalker girl. Their dilemmas are riveting, their actions have consequence, and it was stressful to see their relationship impacted by harrowing events.If I could nitpick, though, the voice acting can be awkward here and there. It has nothing to do with the European accents, but the occasional monotonous delivery. I feel some lines could've been said with more sentiment and grit to make the slow-paced moments pop to a greater extent. I also groaned at the film's unfitting, punctuating use of the dreaded Wilhelm scream. Really killed the mood at one point for me.With those minor setbacks aside, I highly recommend Wolfwalkers. I haven't seen many new films this year, but this is undoubtedly one of the best. Don't expect the traditional elements of animated cinema. Wolfwalkers is not a humorous and lighthearted picture. It's not devoid of cheerful moments, but it's strictly to be admired for its daring artistry. A breath of fresh air, I should say.",Wolfwalkers

They are both off. The talking is too quiet at times so you struggle to hear what is going on because there are booming sound effects or a score for it to compete with.

51,Oktay_Tuna,WolfWalkers is Gorgeous!,9,23 December 2020,"WolfWalkers features one of the best hand drawn animations in recent years(if not all time). It is on par with Studio Ghibli films and I'm also glad that its story is also great. The voiceover in this film is very well especially Honor Kneafsey(Robyn) whose accent I adored. The film is very similar to Princess Mononoke, it is kind of a homage to it but it was also able to find something original. In the first 30 minutes(setup portion) I thought that the film was overhyped because while its animation was gorgeous, its story felt mediocre(a girl suppressed) It is not bad or anything, it's just that we had seen it so many times before. When Robyn and Mebh start spending time together, the film shined. I loved everything about their relationship, their chemistry was just amazing. I could just watch them being together, talking and running for 2 hours straight. The symbolism to old history is also very well done for the adult audiences but it doesn't mean this movie is not for children. It is entertaining and has a simple message as well but the way they integrated a deeper message(intended for adults) to the film surprised me. They nailed it. The ending felt kind of more childish(so that it can get a PG rating) compared to Princess Mononoke which was more raw(I know that movie wasn't intended for children, but thematically about nature vs. Humankind it goes way deeper). I still liked the ending though because I believe that was the best thing they could do to still keep it a children-friendly movie. The film also does a very good job at creating the perfect pacing which is especially hard for family-friendly animations. Overall WolfWalkers is a fantastic movie made for both children and adults and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a great experience.",Wolfwalkers
52,theredsky,Wolfwalkers Review,8,8 December 2020,"The biggest surprise of 2020 for me. I was privileged to watch this before it's released to the general public at the Savannah Film Festival. There's a lot here to appreciate. The animation is one of them. It's simplistic but it still looks incredible. Every character, every building, every tree is different and unique from the next and the way they frame these shots is great. The animation style makes these environments look rich and beautiful. The performances are great too. Each cast meme we did a great job portraying their characters especially Sean Bean and these portrayals made the emotional beats hit much harder and this is all due to the great character development and writing. Every main character has a purpose and an arc they go through like the father realizing that just because something may look dangerous on the outside doesn't mean they are dangerous on the inside. The story here is simplistic and that's what I think holds this film from a 9/10 or a 10/10. Elements of the story feel a little basic but that's okay because it's not geared towards adults. This was an incredible animated movie and I'm thankful that I got to check it out early. Please watch this when it comes out later this month. It's probably the best animated film of the year and I don't see anything else topping it.",Wolfwalkers

55,mbrcf,A solid animation,7,13 September 2020,"TIFF 2020 07WolfwalkersThis is a really enjoyable animation from Tom Moore and Ross Stewart. The animation style is close to last year's acclaimed work Klaus, but in terms of story and setting, it really ressembles the works of Miyazaki, especially Princess Mononoke. The most major theme in this film is the conflict between humans and nature/forests/animals. It's a solid work and there wasn't any things to complain about, but it's a theme that has been explored many times before. Also Sean Bean rocks in whatever he does.",Wolfwalkers
56,isaacsundaralingam,The storybook visuals create a stunning and endearing work of art,10,5 April 2021,"First things first... the aesthetics of the movie was incredible. The art style, the overall visual harmony, the storytelling magic... just works seamlessly with each other. The plot was simple, cute and at the same time heartful, the characters were extremely likeable and well acted (I just couldn't get enough of the accents lol), the music was otherworldly and ethereal, and pretty much everything about this folklore like universe of the wolfwalkers keeps you immersed in an experience you don't want to exit out of.Wolfwalkers was wonderful, and is one that I believe everyone can love no matter what age they are.",Wolfwalkers
57,mbhgkmsgg,Wolfwalkers,8,13 December 2020,"Wolfwalkers is a stunningly beautiful animation. With its striking art style and touching story, it's also a wonderfully good movie. The fact that I hesitated to watch it honestly makes me a little upset. It positively surprised me in pretty much every way possible.Films made in the style of Wolfwalkers are mostly unknown to me. When I first saw screenshots of the film, the art style did turn me off a little bit. And although I heard nothing but good things about it, I still felt unsure about how much I would like the way the film looks. Alas, I had no reason to worry. While it did take me a moment to get used to it and stop thinking about it, as soon as I fell into the story, I started to appreciate the striking style. And while it's striking, it's also tremendously beautiful. Especially the scenes in the forest, where a big part of the movie takes place, are simply stunning.The story, which introduces us to Robyn, a girl who dreams of becoming a wolfhunter, like his dad, is full of moments of conflict and beauty. Robyn, who ends up being bitten by a wolf, soon learns that some fairytales might be more real than others. And when she finds new friends, the dream of being a hunter quickly fades away, as she must defend them from a life-threatening threat. While the story might not be filled with twists and turns and is for the most part easily predictable, it's also beautiful and emotional. Indeed, it's the kind of story that works better when it can be predicted. Being able to focus on what the movie had to say, and how it said it, was much more impactful than worrying about what was going to happen next. It's also a surprisingly deep story, with nearly all characters facing dilemmas and having to fight against preconceived ideas.In many ways, I think that Wolfwalkers has been the most surprising film of 2020, at least for me. Going in, I had no idea what to expect, and in all honesty, my own preconceived ideas might've caused me to doubt its greatness. To say that I was positively surprised, would be an enormous understatement. The film captured my attention with its stunning visuals and kept it with a beautiful and heartfelt story. Wolfwalkers is, without a doubt, the best animated film of the year.",Wolfwalkers
58,Dello_,Outstanding animation for a good story,9,5 January 2021,"""WolfWalkers"" is a great film with an outstanding animation, inspired music and a really good story. It is enjoyable by kids but I found some deeper meanings about diversity, inclusion and religious radicalism. As previously said I loved so much the animation of this movie and I found myself totally immersed in the environment. In my opinion it's not perfect because I would've changed a few plot points but overall it is a very good picture. Suggested.",Wolfwalkers
59,j_movie,some feelings,7,18 August 2021,"If it fails to meet expectations, the picture is beautiful, but the promotion of the story is too simple and perfunctory. Many collisions and conflicts about race, nature, class, colonization and civilization only throw out a simple shell proposition, which does not achieve effective extension and excavation, and finally can only flow to the surface. For a second and third rate animation company, of course, there is no need to put forward such high requirements, but for the animation salon team, it is regrettable that there is such an obvious setback at the narrative level. I've been talking a little too much about Dad recently. After reading this movie, I feel even more serious.",Wolfwalkers
60,Clank_Zoka,This Year's Isle of Dogs But with Wolves,10,1 November 2020,"Well I'm long overdue for another review, however there wasn't any animated films for me to talk to because of well.., you know what, except for this..., this is one of my most highly anticipated films of this year!, this is the latest film from Cartoon Saloon and it's directed by Tomm Moore who did Secret of Kells, Song of the Sea and produced Breadwinner all of which I really liked with Song of the Sea being my personal favourite, so I was beyond excited to hear this was coming out this year, i didn't even know it was coming out until I found out it was coming to Apple TV, I remember there was a concept trailer for it and it looked really cool, because as we know Cartoon Saloon's films are based on Irish Folklore or something like that, it's coming to Apple TV in two months, however it was actually out in my local cinema, I heard so many amazing things about this film, it was played at film festivals and it was almost like one of the most talked about films of this year, so of course I would jump to the chance of seeing it!, so I saw it yesterday pre Lockdown (second time) in a sort of empty screwing and...., wow!, this might be my favourite film of the year, I'm not even joking, so let's talk about it.In 1650, a hunter named Bill Goodfellowe (Sean Bean) and his daughter Robyn (Honor Kneafsey) move from England to this small Irish town in need of hunting some wolves, however Bill is just needed while his daughter stays in the village so she is safe from them, however she wants to help his father kill the wolves, so she sneaks out of the town and happens to come across a wolfwalker named Mebh (Eva Whittaker), who can transform into a Wolf when she is a sleep, Robyn then quickly grows fond of her and they both start a bond, as friends, however as the Lord Protector (Simon McBurney) is trying to get rid of all wolves to protect his town, so Robyn has to convince his father that Wolfwalkers are real and must do what she can to save her friend and the wolves, first off I love the idea of the folklore of Wolves and how someone who is bitten by one can transform into a Wolf, it's quite a unique idea and the storytelling is at it's finest, it tells the story in a unique and wonderful way using visuals to tell it stories along with strong emotion and action that define the characters and the world around them, it's also balances out sweet charming humour with real and powerful emotion and by the third act it really drives the emotion home, it's also really creative in how Wolfwalkers work, there are so many enchanting and fun scenes where characters are running free as Wolves, it's really beautiful and just lovely, granted it can be rather predictable, however it's actually not too cliched, you just want to see how it ends and the film really does pay off and does have a very satisfying ending, it's also quite grim and dark also, there are scenes where characters get shot by arrows via crossbow and the impact and the scenery really ramps up the dark factor in making it real and shocking, it's also a very mature animated film which is kind of rare since nowadays it's toilet and reference humour, but this time the humour is very playful and quite charming and it feels nature then forced, so the storytelling, the directing and the nature feel to it really makes the film feel more genuine and real despite being animated and having fantasy elements to it, it's perfect storytelling mixed with nice humour and strong emotion, especially Robyn and Mebh's friendship, the story feels like a strong pack.The animation is just unbelievable, I knew this company was capable of making stunning 2D animated films, but this takes it to a whole new level, this is unlike anything I have ever seen, first off It's great to see 2D animation on the big screen, it's very cool and such a huge experience for me especially since we mainly have 3D and stop-motion animation, with that said this is some of the most original and unique 2D animation I have seen in a very long time, I love the way this films looks, the characters are all nicely design with unique facial expressions, shapes and movements, the backgrounds are atmospherically gorgeous with smooth shading and outlines, I also love the way the forest and the town is structured, it's like a painting or a puzzle it's really outstanding, however my favourite aspect of the animation is the Wolfwalker part, the wolves are wonderfully designed especially Mebh and Robyn, there is sense (no pun intended) of you can tell it's them by their eye colour and even their fur colour kind of represents who they are, there are scenes where we would see the world from a Wolfwalker's point of view, where we would see lots of outlines of trees and animals but a lot of them are in all sorts of different vibrant colours, it's really something to behold, we may have seen 2D animation in many beautiful and unique ways, but the animation here unleashed it's full potential.The characters are loveable and well defined, they are all very believable and just a joy to watch!, Robyn is quite a endearing main character, she is adventurous, curious, cheeky and really sweet, I really enjoyed her and especially when you can really sympathise with her, at times when the film gets emotion you really do feel sorry for her since she is trying to convince Bill that Wolfwalkers exist, speaking of which, Bill is probably one of the best animated dads out there, he is really charming, caring and a very relatable dad also, his relationship with Robyn is both lovely and heartbreaking, Mebh is also a really endearing and great character, her friendship with Robyn is quite cute and heartwarming, she is full of energy but also has a emotional side to her, when both Robyn and Mebh turn into wolves it's really enchanting and very cute to see them both run free in the woods, there are other characters like the bullies, the soldiers, the one who saw Mebh and her mother turn into a Wolfwalker and even the wolves themselves play a supporting role, although the wolves play a big part in the film, the rest are just stereotypes but they do make sense and do play a small key role in what they are supposed to be even if it's not major, however the villain of the film is the Lord Professor, he's the one who wants to kill all the wolves in the name of the lord, while not a strong villain, he is rather understandable as to why he wants to get rid of them, he's not really that much of a big bad, just a leader trying to protect his town from beasts and threats, as for the voice acting, it's.... really fantastic, they are play their parts rather naturally and put in so much emotion which is very good in my book, Sean Bean voices Bill and he is great as always so no complaints there, Honor Kneafsey as Robyn is brilliant, she really sounds like she was really enjoying voicing and you can tell she is put in so much emotion in her performance, same can be said with Eva Whittaker as Mebh, she really puts in lots of energy and enthusiasm as well, Simon McBurney is pretty good, in fact everyone does a fantastic job with their voice performances even if they don't play a big role, the characters really have that feel of genuineness and realism, along with playful humour, heart and understandable motives, along with phenomenal voice acting, the characters are really pawesome!..., I had to.On a side note, the music used in this film really captures that Irish feel and sound to it, the score is genuinely wonderful, it's composed by the amazing Bruno Coulais and he really outdid himself here, it's one score I really want to listen to when the soundtrack comes out, along with very fitting songs including the very popular ""Running with the Wolves"" song by Aurora which is a really good song by the way!What else can I say that hasn't been said already?, this film is.... just unbelievable, it's unlike anything I have ever seen, from the huge responses it's getting from critics and audiences along with some great ratings!..., I am comfortable to say that this film is a masterpiece!, Wolfwalkers is not only my favourite film from Cartoon Saloon, but it might be the best animated film and film in general of this year!, it has an amazingly well told story with a creative concept, it's really grim and dark, it has good heart and sweet humour, along with epic action and a intense third act, animation that is mindbogglingly gorgeous and stylish, characters who are mature and well written, along with terrific voice acting and lovely music!, it's just fantastic, if you are a fan of the studio, go check it out if you can, as for everyone else, I do highly recommend it, please try and see before it leaves cinemas, it's out for a limited time or wait until it's on Apple TV, it's a must see for all ages know I'll be watching it again, this studio has impressed me before but now..., this is their magnum opus, I hope they continue to make more films like this, because not many people see them which is a shame really but I'm glad I saw this one as soon as I can, as rubbish as the year was, at least we got something incredible to hopefully finish off the year (Until Soul comes out that is).This film one hundred percent deserves a 10/10!",Wolfwalkers

Worth the Apple+ subscription if more movies like this are made.,Wolfwalkers
67,Deathstryke,"It's no Princess Mononoke, but it's ok",6,22 December 2020,"On the plus side: It's much better than previous Saloon films. Visually it still opts for the distinct illustrative style they are known for, but the pacing and storytelling is more dynamic this time around. It's faster, punchier, more aggressive than Song of the Sea and the animation in the wolf running sequences is spell-binding. The emotional moments resonate well without feeling too mawkish and the invigorating score by Kila is a joy. There are problems though.The plot of the hero befriending the noble savage and teaming up to defeat invading forces has certainly been visited many times before (Dances With Wolves, Ferngully, Pocahontas, Princess Mononoke, Avatar) and Wolfwalkers doesn't really do anything new with it.
The heroine, Robyn, daughter of a British trap hunter tasked with wiping out wolves from a surrounding forest in Kilkenny, wants desperately to escape the shackles of domestic life. While exploring the forest, she runs into Mebh, a wild untamed wolfwalker who can magically commune with wolves, and discovers the freedom, magic and beauty therein. Robyn must try to convince her father to disobey his orders and save Mebh and the forest from destruction. From that synopsis alone, it's easy to imagine how those story arcs play out, if you've seen the other films I mentioned. At times sequences look and feel like they've been lifted directly from these sources and dropped into a different art style. Cliché messages about embracing the animal within abound.Characters are depicted as one-dimensional stereotypes, particularly the invading Brits and the main villain, Lord Protector, a bland copy of Disney's Governor Ratcliff and Judge Frollo, who tries to tame this pagan-Celtic world one bible quote at a time. Princess Mononoke managed to be more ambiguous as to where the good and bad lies across the opposing factions, which made for a more engaging film, in my view. Wolfwalkers, however, seems to be aimed at a much younger audience and is thus played very straight.
The Irish peasants are all represented as feeble-minded bog-dwellers, which I found surprising coming from an Irish studio. It seemed like they wanted to play up the Paddywhackery for laughs, but I found all the ""ahh to be sure"" gags more eye-roll worthy than funny, if I'm honest.Another nitpicky issue for me was the voice acting. It was disappointingly flat and amateurish in a few places and lacked real drama. I'm not sure if all the actors were recorded together or separately, but their voices sometimes didn't sound like they were in the moment or really reacting to one another.Gripes aside, this was an entertaining watch and easily the best animated feature to come out of Ireland in a long time.",Wolfwalkers
68,numenorsniper-66396,Almost a 10/10...,9,21 January 2021,"I first watched Secret of Kells in 2010 and was blown away. I since then have seen all of Cartoon Saloon's films, and up until watching WolfWalkers just now I felt that Song of the Sea was overall their strongest, yet Wolfwalkers may now co-hold that title...WolfWalkers is a beautiful film in every sense of the word. It is of course (like its predecessors) artistically captivating, and adds new animation techniques and striking art direction that made me go ""wooaahh"" multiple times, and have to pause the film and look at it all properly many times. It has callbacks to Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea both with the choice of animation as well as story beats and themes. It also reminded me other animated films such as Pocahontas (especially with the main villain), and Princess Mononoke. Speaking of which, the studio Cartoon Saloon now feels like an Irish Studio Ghibli in some ways, what with its very distinct animation and story styles, as well as its poignant expression of Irish folklore and mythology. It is very clear how much love, attention to detail, and passion for their craft that everyone involved has, and yet again they have produced a masterpiece that I consider to be one of the best animated films I've seen, and I've seen a lot!My only tiny gripe with the film is that it felt like it ended too quickly, after a very long (but great) build up. However maybe that's just my own projection, as afterall the overall message of the film remains to be very potent indeed.I hope this movie will help with the push towards re-wilding and bringing back wolf populations, but respecting them this time rather than treating them with contempt as we did before.Wolfwalkers is a wonderful film for all ages, and made me cry multiple times throughout. Beautiful, thank you Cartoon Saloon!",Wolfwalkers
69,TheOnlyOwen01,On Another Level,9,30 April 2021,"Wolfwalkers is an animated movie from the creators of Song Of The Sea, The Breadwinner and The Secret Of Kells (Song Of The Sea being the only one I've actually seen and I really liked it). I'm not gonna spend much time talking about the plot because this is a movie that's best watched blind. I knew absolutely nothing about it and as a result, I was floored by it. Wolfwalkers is a truly magnificent film and easily my favorite movie to come out in 2020.The animation for this movie is absolutely incredible. Some of the best I've ever seen. 2D animation is my favorite type of animation and every single shot in this movie is so beautiful that could probably be used as a background for a phone or computer. Another standout was the musical score. This score is fantastic and one of the best I've heard in years.What surprised me the most was the actual story of this movie . I wasn't expecting much and I was floored by it. It's heartfelt, emotional, dark and creative. And the characters that inhabit this world are just as compelling. I can't recall one character I disliked and not only are these characters great, they all serve a purpose to the story.In the end, Wolfwalkers is an absolutely superb movie.

I loved the animation, the soundtrack, the story and the characters. This is a perfect watch for people of any age. The art within the movie is detailed and feels like a trip.The Good - Everything. At no point did I feel bored, the movie was very emotional and engaging to me. I loved the soundtrack behind it. The character's voices and themselves were very cute.The Bad - I could see a bit of similarity with Princess Mononoke but this is no doubt a beautiful film that captures a lupine essence. The real bad part of the movie is it's marketing. I guess launching it on AppleTV+ is a risky move in the beginning. Agreed in the times where COVID-19 has taken over, movies are not being promoted well but I personally believe if they stuck with Amazon Prime or Netflix it would hit a huge audience early!I am rooting for this movie to have a cult fanbase.

It looks great.And there's some messaging in the adventures - it's strongly environmental (nothing surprising there) but also touches on England's colonial control of Ireland in the 1600s.That being said, most of the characters in the story aren't as memorable as the vivid look of the movie itself. The film does mirror some of Princess Mononoke's storyline (humans leading wolves), but Miyazaki's characters have much more depth and complexity.This fable is very dark and violent (it's not a young kid's movie) - and the resolution is generally predictable - but it does look great and is ultimately uplifting.

I only had one problem, the emotions weren't expressed as it should be sometimes (this in my regional dub) and makes some scenes feel less strong that they should be.

85,skitofit,Very unique 2d animation.,10,26 December 2020,"As far as 2d animations go most pieces focus on clean up, but in a refreshing way this animation embraces its creative roots, making it not only visually captivating but a great tutorial/reference material; Often times you can see the rough shape references within the characters. And The fact that this animation breaks this rule is also inspiring, showing that rough is beautiful. This also works on a subconscious level, as the theme of the film is embracing the ""wild"" and living in harmony with nature which is relevant to the film as the creative the wild process of animation conveys the harmony of creative process within. I'm glad to see a film that defies the clean up process in this way and does so well.
Beyond the roughing of the characters, the background and environments, and the portrayal of them, is also unique, ignoring the traditionally accepted angles of line of action, this film has an almost Gustav klimnt feel. Shapes of houses and the castle ground almost have a classical art feel.The story, character arch, and plot plays out like a typical Disney film, and the colours of the scenes feel like water colour at times.

94,TruthTeller98765,Breathtaking - adults and kids alike can marvel at this film,10,14 May 2021,"I have kids and watch a lot of kids movies with them. There are a lot of bad kids movies out there. Even the ""good"" Disney and Pixar films start to grate on you after a while simply because, for all their exquisite production values, they really are all hitting the same emotional ""make them cry"" notes. There is very much a Disney/Pixar narrative blueprint, much like there is a Marvel (MCU) narrative blueprint for its shows/movies. You can change individual narrative components and storylines, but ultimately you have to follow the overall quality-tested and approved narrative blueprint if you want to make a movie for Disney/Pixar.Wolfwalkers is such a breath of fresh air coming out of Europe. It looks and feels so different than what you are conditioned to after watching Toy Story, Moana, and Frozen for the 100th time each. In a vacuum, the plot reads as a bit derivative, and perhaps it is. But the way the story is told and depicted feels so different. You would know, right off the bat, that this is made by someone other than Pixar/Disney, even if you did not know that prior. The beautiful hand-crafted animation is the first giveaway. When was the last time we saw any animated movie, by anyone, that looks as good as this? The way people talk and act is the next thing I noticed. It is hard to put into words but it is just different than what we are conditioned to. There is no ""deconstruction"" of kids' movie tropes here. The protagonist is a strong young woman, but she is organically strong. She is not strong in the caricatured 2021 sense of ""strong young woman who recites feminist political lines and hates men"" that we see even in kids' movies today. Wolfwalkers is not a front for any political themes at all. There are no ""mansplaining"" references here. Wolfwalkers is just a great kids movie that your kids can watch and take inspiration from.Give this movie a watch. You will not be disappointed.",Wolfwalkers

97,Castrum-doloris-ad-astra,Cartoon Saloon's best film yet,9,24 June 2021,"Wolfwalkers is a story about a British hunter family investigating the Irish lands for wolves, but more importantly, its about finding happiness while being in a cage. The way it chronicles its protagonist Robyn trying to handle her own independence from her overprotective father is amazing, and it shows respect to both sides instead of painting things on the side of one person. Wolfwalkers, and Cartoon Saloon films in general, capture some sort of spirit that you look for in Disney, but it isn't quite there. Every little step and scene means something, and the stakes climb higher and higher. Combine all this with amazing animation and angelic music. My favorite character was Mebh due to the rawness of her emotion and how she never stopped fighting for Moll, even in a town full of people wanting to execute them both. The scene where she screamed for her mother was tearjerking.Now, spoiler time. Remember what I said earlier about Bill, Robyn's father? I think what was important about the film showing his side with respect was that, in a lot if ways, Bill was becoming Cromwell, even though his intentions were to keep Robyn safe. If it wasn't for him realizing his ways earlier, he would have become no different from the man who wanted to kill his daughter for who she was. Bill thought he was an ally of Cromwell, but at the end of the day he was someone who Cromwell saw as just as disposable as the rest of the wolves. What stopped him from going down that path was doing what broke him down the most, and letting Robyn go. He wanted her to be happy, and the only way for that was to let her be herself, and she could only be herself if she was free. The movie repeatedly brought up the theme of freedom contrasted with safety, and in the end, they all earned both together. An underrated film, it deserves more recognition and revive a new genre of children's movies and 2D animation.",Wolfwalkers

Their use of colour, the clever application of geometric shapes, the references to traditional Irish art forms: all these elements blend together to create something new and fresh.As for the narrative itself, it starts off fine enough but soon slows its pace and drags a bit. And then, a bit before the halfway point, it picks up again and grows into a very lively and captivating story.The action might be a bit too intense at times for children younger than 8 years old.

104,Thumper-113,The brilliant view of two kinds in one world,10,13 December 2020,"Wolfwalkers is the newest film to the astonishingly creative team of Cartoon Saloon, and they have surely reminisced my love for the style of hand drawn animation storytelling with this film.We are introduced to the main character Robyn, a girl who wishes to be just like her father Bill as a hunter, but her father fears for her safety and prefers she remains a normal status as a scullery maid. However, wanting to help her father with hunting down wolves that have been disturbing the peace of the town, Robyn decides to follow him into the woods, only to discover the entirety of the wolf pack and discover a little girl among them known as Mebh.The two befriend, and Mebh reveals to Robyn her identity as a Wolfwalker, a mystical being who has the ability to transform their soul into a wolf while their body stays behind asleep. Along the way Mebh accidentally bites Robyn which inevitably turns her into a wolfwalker herself, and all the while the townsfolk and lord protector Oliver begin to grow hastier by the day with the presence of the wolf pack close to their village.First off, the animation all throughout this movie was spectacular. I loved how the different colors, lining, and textures all symbolize the themes and emotions this movie makes you feel scene by scene. It also delves greatly into the idea of ""see what I see"" at times by showing us amazingly drawn first perspectives of what a wolf can see, hear, and even feel. There are even moments of supernatural elements being present that I thought had a great combination with its surroundings when released such as the levitated vines to lead the way, or the stone carvings show us an entire story in itself.Robyn and Mebh were so much fun to watch together, and even after just a couple days of them interacting with one another, you could already see a strong friendship vibe between the two. The chemistry between them also made the story very unique, as you've got Robyn a townie and a hunter, and Mebh the feral wolfwalker who takes Robyn on a journey of self-discovery within the vast world of nature.I also found Moll and Bill's roles in this story to be an interesting mix of complication, because both of them believe what they're doing is right for their daughters, but when really their lack of freedom allowance for their children is only causing them to rebel further. A character like Bill is a great example of this because he may think he knows what he's doing is for the betterment of his work and Robyn, but his flaw is the continuous refusal to understand the other side's beliefs and predicaments. As for Oliver, his belief in keeping order and the safety of the citizens for the town is understandable, but what makes him a great villain for this movie is his representation of the belief that nature mustn't co-exist with civilization.The music choices of smooth tones and wicked showdowns also brought a great atmosphere to the world since when you see Mebh and Robyn running around together as wolves, the joyful and strong music brought within these scenes allowed me to believe in things like Robyn and her acceptance to becoming a wolfwalker. You could even say each character had their own style of music every time they were shown, especially for Oliver due to his strong presence of dominance which brought a rough and low tone to better represent his status and what the viewer should think of him.Overall this was an amazing otherworldly tale of friendship, acceptance, change, and fighting your beliefs for what is right. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to see a good sense of another being's view of the world, as well as anyone who loves a good and mesmerizing fashion of hand drawn storytelling at its finest.",Wolfwalkers
105,udongexmyon,"Not Pixar, and that's a good thing",7,21 March 2021,"Look, I'm not saying Pixar is bad. They've consistently given us the some of the best animated films over the years, and while the Oscars seems to have a fascination with them most of their wins are well deserved.That is, until Cars 2.After Cars 2, they've been reduced to making agreeable sequels of their most classic titles, much to the disappointment of those waiting for the next Ratatouille. Sure, there was Inside Out too, but that's one good movie in a sea of mediocrity. Disney Animation has somewhat picked up the mantle, but even their best films are but a minor copy of better Pixar films.Wolfwalkers is what the world of animation needed, and for this reason it is even more saddening to accept that it will most likely fade into obscurity quickly. Cartoon Saloon delivers another 2D masterpiece that is neither anime or Pixar. Unlike Song of the Sea, the plot is simple and follow a conventional storytelling method. It works for what it is, but isn't particularly compelling nor is it the driving force of this film.The strength of the film lies in its incredible visuals, and when something has such an obvious strength, the rest just has to avoid being a detriment. It knowingly pulls its punches with the plot, knowing that a more complicated plot will take attention away from from its main strength and appeal. This approach to priority is similar to other visually powerful productions such as Kubo and the Two Strings and the Wallace and Gromit series.Do not for one moment think that this is just a film with pretty backgrounds. The fine craft of this masterpiece truly shines in motion and shadow. Everything is exaggerated, fluid and incredibly detailed. The background, lighting and shadows are all effectively manipulated to control the scene and create direction, motion and focus, something only possible in the world of traditional animation (and even then so rarely done).We tend to give little recognition to those that deserve it, and instead choose the easy path with obvious choices. Big Hero 6 won the Best Animated Feature with The Tale of Princess Kaguya and Song of the Sea in competition, despite being a merely average animated film. While Wolfwalkers is currently nominated for the Best Animated Feature, it seems unlikely that it will win over Soul.Of course, an award isn't everything. Whether it gains widespread acclaim or fades into obscurity, the best we can do individually is be glad that we were able to experience this film. Do yourself a favor and watch Wolfwalkers.",Wolfwalkers
106,generaallucas,"Solid animation, good voice acting, ''meh'' story",8,14 December 2020,"As I am a fan of the works of Cartoon Saloon (especially Puffin Rock, which I praised for taking the intelligence of young children seriously), this was naturally on my list.The animation in the movie is rock solid, stylish, even daring at times and provides a great result.The voice acting was decent, Sean Bean put on his Lord Stark voice and everyone else delivered decent performances. The casting choices matched their characters.Music was good, wouldn't say they were memorable but they fit the tone very well.The story was ''meh''. Not terrible, but nothing of real value either. Character development was non-existent - the plot took too long to get going, specific conversations repeated several times without anything different about them and the themes (e.g. Christianity vs. Celtic Mythology) was watered down to a ''Christian Man bad, misinformed and dumb - Celtic people good'' argument. it's a shame, because a lot could've been done with it.That's not to say its bad - the pace was good. The place in time it takes part in (directly after the English Civil War), and how the Irish/English relations were, were done properly. The characters are a product of that time, and that was very well done. The Celtic symbolism was excellent and superbly detailed, it's just a shame they put in 0 effort for the Christian side of the conflict and their justifications except ''well, God wants it this way I guess''. It's also a shame there was 0 tension, since nothing dramatic actually happened where you might think ""I hope character X will make it.""I guess that's the core problem; the story didn't dare to do anything with its plot, characters, themes and lore. Robyn didn't have to go hunting for rabbits or deer and kill them for food and have inner conflict about it. The mother didn't die. Ned Stark survived. (Sean Bean surviving, that's a new one for me). That daring is something movies like Princess Mononoke did, and that is such movies are stronger.All in all, good movie, nothing legendary like the Lion King or Pinnochio, but I would let my child watch this.",Wolfwalkers

Very simplistic in it's artstyle, yet it conveys so much. I also really enjoy the main characters and I rewatched this movie more than I am proud to say out loud.That being said, the story has elements that have been seen somewhere else. The father character feels very standard, the main character feels very standard and the supporting character also feels very standard. Even the animal sidekick character feels very standard. Don't get me wrong: they ARE enjoyable, but nothing you haven't seen before - I enjoyed the dynamic Robyn and Mébh had. However, when Robyn let her down not once but twice by not appearing when she had compromised... well it was odd to see Mébh still wanting to be near her when she wasn't EVER given the context as to why Robyn hadn't appeared in the first place. I also wish we knew what drove the MacTíre to be cursed into becoming Wolfwalkers and how they adapted to that transition. It is never explained in the movie, we don't even know if they were always like that.The soundtrack slaps and I wish there was a full version of the song Robyn sings while playing hunter at the beginnig.There is this part of the climax that is a bit of a downer because you know things will work out at the end and it seems to be so overly dramatic for no reason - but whatever, there is another part of the climax that I really enjoyed when the father character finally decides to do what's right and not what he's being told to do and THE STAKES MAN.

117,press-31193,Wolfwalkers - Odyssey of the Senses By Maria Elena Gutierrez,10,31 March 2021,"In Wolfwalkers, a young English girl called Robyn Goodfellowe escapes Kilkenny, the Irish town to which she has been brought by her father, in order to explore the wonders of the surrounding forest. In doing so, she turns her back on the world of human beings and opens herself to the world of wolves.At this fundamental level, Wolfwalkers can be seen as a story of the conflict between civilization and nature. To this end, directors Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart employ two distinct visual styles. The town of Kilkenny is rendered in flat geometric shapes and dark colors. It is oppressive, solid like a block. Thematically this represents the English Puritanical religious views of 1650, and the embodiment of this is the Lord Protector. When he first shows up, the frame is almost devoid of color: his suit and headgear are black and white, with only a splash of red in the emblem on his flag, which symbolizes the violence and killing of the wolves.In contrast, the world of the forest is an enchanted paradise. It looks like a three-dimensional watercolor painting - it's fluid and loose, filled with energy and life. When we see the wolves running through the trees, they move like liquid. All of this tells us that nature is the space of creativity, the space of liberation. Indeed, Mebh openly tells Robyn: ""Come and be free in the forest. Come and play.""
While the design of the town draws on woodcut illustrations from the period, the forest owes a clear debt to the highly decorative manuscripts produced by Irish and British monks between 700-1,000 AD, known as ""insular illumination"" and perhaps best represented by the wonderful Book of Kells. This artistic tradition used sophisticated interlacing and zoomorphic decoration to represent the complexity of nature, its deep interconnectedness, and its organic wholeness. In a luscious visual vegetation, images grow one into the other while animals lurk enigmatically in the background. Not surprisingly, this form of art is an ideal match for a story where nature plays a central role. Sometimes, the visual complexity and the dynamism of images in Wolfwalkers is so exuberant that we have the impression of entering a new visual world resembling that of the Viennese Secession, best exemplified by the work of Gustav Klimt.Having passed from the hard, geometric world of the town into the fluid space of the forest, Robyn meets Mebh, a girl about her age who is the embodiment of the natural world. This contrast between town and countryside is echoed in the design of these two protagonists. Look at Mebh, and you will see that the shape of her hair resembles a leaf; her face is round like a heart. But Robyn, who desperately wants to be a hunter, has a face shaped like an arrow; in certain sequences her cape takes the shape of an arrow, too.The world of nature has yet another aspect, because it is also a space of magic and ritual. We first see evidence of this in the inscriptions on the walls of the cave where Mebh resides with her mother and the wolves. These markings immediately transport us back to a time when human beings first felt the need to represent sacred beings through drawing. In this way the cave represents our relationship to the divine world and reminds us that, in order to forge the future, we must first explore the past.Venturing deeper into the cave, we discover Mebh's mother represented in a way that evokes ideas of a Mother Earth Goddess. This returns us to the sacred moment when humans and animals lived in symbiosis, and again we see this story recounted on the walls of the cave. As we absorb the ancient narrative, we realise we are in the presence of the divine.Even the shape of the cave is suggestive and full of meaning, resembling as it does female anatomy. In this and many other ways, the movie is a celebration of woman.For example, Robyn is an archetype of the woman standing against the oppressive authority of men, just like Antigone, stood against her uncle Creon in order to honor paganism and the oral laws of the gods. There are clear echoes of Antigone's story in Wolfwalkers, where the townspeople are told repeatedly that terrible things will to happen if they cut down the trees. At one point, the woodcutter explains to Robyn's father that Saint Patrick made a pact with the pagan god. As for the Wolfwalkers themselves- they are the magical gods, the divinities who have existed in the forest since primordial times, since before history began.Wolfwalkers is also a celebration of the senses. When Robyn passes from the hard, geometric world of the town into the fluid space of the forest - and in particular when she transforms into a wolf - Mebh tells her not to rely on her eyes. Instead, Robyn must learn to use her other senses - her sense of smell, or the feel of the earth beneath her paws. Mebh is there to guide her - and also us, the audience - into this sensory world.In addition, beyond even the power of the senses, Mebh possesses the healing power of magic. Yet she cannot cure her mother alone. In order to do that she needs help. She needs the pack, the community, the collective. The power of the family. Even this heroine, this girl with superhero powers, cannot succeed alone. The ultimate message of Wolfwalkers, therefore, stands in defiance of individualism. If we as human beings are going to heal nature, we need each other.Dr. Maria Elena Gutierrez is the CEO and executive director of VIEW Conference, Italy's premiere annual digital media conference.

118,DimasDarko,Charming and beautiful,8,15 January 2021,"It is very rare that is find a film like this to be genuinely enjoyable and engaging, However this films tone and style won me over. While I wasn't a huge fan of ""The Breadwinner"" I was still interested enough to have an eye out for Cartoon Saloon's newest films. Low and behold this was the film that I was waiting for.When watching this film I looked at what separated this from its contemporary's, And one of the most outstanding feature of this movie is its style. You would think 2D animated movies would often use its genre as an excuse for a more creative presentation, and when it comes to most movies that is not the case. ""Wolfwalkers"" on the other hand utilizes its style to the best of its ability's. in someway this movie often feels like a story being told to a child while we're looking into that childs imagination. The foreground is much more detailed and specific than the background, as if in a childs mind that is how it would look.The story was also very ""tale"" like but it had a much more mature and descriptive world. It was so refreshing to watch a film that deeply cares about its worldbuilding. The voice acting to its originality, this was an improvement from the breadwinner on all fronts This is the best animated movie I have seen in a while (let alone this year), and I hope this movie gets its recognition it deserves.

119,mihirnanda,Visually beautiful and emotionally on point.,10,14 December 2020,"I loved this film for the following reasons.
1. The kind of animation that they have used. All hand-drawn. Like the cartoons we used to see earlier when we were kids.
2. Sean Bean has given voice to one of the characters and I'm a fan of his after Game of Thrones and LOTR: TFOTR and so, it was a treat to hear him.
3. The trope of man v/s nature (like in Pocahontas, Avatar and Atlantis: The Lost Empire). I liked all three of these films and so, there's no doubt that I'd like this one too.
4. The subtexts beside the subject matter.
The main theme is what I mentioned earlier. But other than that, if you can read between the lines, you'll notice how subtly the film points out racism and also how effortlessly it showcases feminism.
5. The ironies. A girl is asked to stay away from forest and wolves by her father and those same wolves are asked to stay away from humans and hunters by a wolfwalker.
A father wants her girl to not go out and speak up because he doesn't want her ""caged"" by the administration and for that, he puts her in another cage; doesn't let her get out and forces her to stay in.
6. The visuals. I was literally mesmerized on seeing the beautiful forests and waterfall and even the town is shown so beautifully with so much detailing.
7. The thrills. Many a times I found myself whispering ""Oh, no"" , ""please, no"" throughout the film.
8. The message. Like the above mentioned films, the message here is so important. The world is as much of other species as it ours.This film is clearly a labour of love and you should definitively check it out. If you are a sucker for animated films, no chance you should miss it and if you don't like them much, try watching this one and maybe you'll start liking them.P.S. : This is a fantasy film so please don't be skeptic about the things that'll happen. Don't watch with your brain, watch it with your heart and give in to the world of this stunning film.",Wolfwalkers
120,yuuki-23947,Another masterpiece by Cartoon Saloon,9,11 December 2020,"In short, the story and characters isn't as good as The Secret of Kells but the art-style, animation and action scenes are pushed next level, it comes together with the music to create something really magical and overwhelming. It's a bit more bombastic, less nuanced and straight-forward that previous Cartoon Saloon movies but when it's that good it's hard to complain about it.",Wolfwalkers
121,socialbeany,"Lovely animation, so-so story",6,25 April 2021,"While the animation was imaginative, the actual story didn't grab me at all, feeling a like a rehash of The Secret of Kells. The dialogue was repetitive and the characters were one-note. It seemed like Robyn and her father had exactly the same argument five or six times through the course of the film.Not nearly as good as the same studio's Song of the Sea from a few years ago (or, indeed, The Secret of Kells).Side comment: the villainous Lord Protector is presumably supposed to be Oliver Cromwell. But he didn't seem to be named as such, either by the characters or in the credits. I wonder whether this was to void offending UK viewers?",Wolfwalkers
122,mostafaw-31454,piece of art,9,25 December 2020,"This movie,one of the best 2d animation movies ever made,one of the best movies in a weak year(2020) ,but why?1)the animation and drawing are incredible
every shot in the fim is an art ,colors are awesome ,overall the 2d animation in its best2)the music is very good but i think that it can be better3)emotions and emotional scenes are awesome especially the second halfafter all this,why did i give the film rating of only 9this because the first half,the first half was a little slowother than that ,the movie is awesome and worth watching",Wolfwalkers
123,dysfunctionalrequest,"It was Ok, not Brilliant.",7,10 November 2020,"Title says it all. Doesn't deserve an 8, the characters are supposed to be charming but they come off as annoying, the plot is cliche in lots of places.
Despite this, the backgrounds are nice, and so is the music - though unfortunately the plot lacks a little, and sometimes the character designs don't work with the backgrounds in some places.
So, the good parts?
Designs were creative for the wolves, the villain was well designed, the music was great and the opening was gripping. The ending, though cliche, is satisfying and opens up many possibilities.
The bad parts?
Like I said, plot is quite an issue as I could see the ending miles away. After the amazing opening, the pace and story lacks for a good portion of the movie, losing the magic it held at the beginning in favour of some annoying characters chasing each other.
Whilst we are on the subject, the characters.
The characters, or one in particular, are a major set back from making this movie from good to great. Mebh was the root of this I think. Her enthusiastic attitude gets old real fast, already having been used to death before. Whereas the opening portrayed her as being silent, she's very sassy and loud mouthed - I would've much preferred a silent Mebh, as this adds an element of mystery and fantasy. It just ruined it for me.
The other characters are okay, Robin's dad was the most likeable, Robin not so much but I could see why they chose that. The villain was good, keeping a mysterious, intimidating feel keeping me engaged with scenes he was in.
Overall, a mediocre movie that has lots of potential and sometimes reaches that potential, but often it is sadly too little too late. The Breadwinner and Song of the Sea were far better.
However, if you like fantasy revolving around animals, and are a fan of animation, it's worth the watch. I am a fan of animation and was in awe at lots of the backgrounds and long shots. Like I said, by far the best part of the movie.
So yeah. Mediocre. At time of writing it stands at 8.3, which I think is far too high (but only 257 have reviewed)",Wolfwalkers

127,FritzRolle732,Running with the Wolves Tonight!,10,15 November 2020,"Finally! After 7 long months, I got to see a film in an actual movie theater, and I could not have picked a better film than Wolfwalkers. Seriously, I do not know where to begin. The only thing I will say though is that this is no doubt the greatest animated film of 2020! When you get the chance to watch this on Apple TV+, look and process every shot that is shown in this film. The reason why is because every shot that was shown is like artwork in a museum. The design/backgrounds of the old town of Kilkenny, Ireland are very structured. All of the motions flow very smoothly. My favorite shots in the film have got to be wolf POV shots. The way how the staff animated the wolves' senses to help explain the audience of what makes a wolf a special creature, makes the watching experience a lot more interesting. Speaking of wolves, I love everything related to them in this film! Their designs, emotions, and the harmonic howls! You name it, I live for it! So to wrap things off, almost everything about this film is absolute perfection. The voice acting, story, characters, theming, music, editing/pacing, and finally the animation. The only thing that I would say the film needed more of was character interaction between Robyn and Mebh before the big conflict. Overall, I am definitely running with the wolves tonight because this movie was a pure work of art! AWOOOOOOO! 9.75/10",Wolfwalkers

135,samirvolt,A very special animation about revolution!,10,9 October 2021,"This is one of the best animated stories I have ever seen in my life. Better than Song Of The Sea and its predecessor.The animation is gorgeous and rich; especially the striking red colors used to convey drama. Yet it remains inventive and flexible; an artistic treat to watch. There is minimalism where it is needed and flare where it is required. The music and voice acting falls in step with the art; creating something special.The main characters express an endearing humanity; that gives the show something most vapid cash cows cannot achieve; sympathy with the characters.While the plot and story are not overly complicated, this is because the movie is mainly meant for children. The story still manages to impress even adults with its general message of; courage, revolutionary action, selflessness, and love.Spoiler. The story centres around a young girl named Robin and her father; a hunter called Goodfellow. The two are newly arrived outsiders who live in a constricting town ruled by a Lord Protector; who is basically a petty dictator. Under English rule, the Irish people are forced to work for their dictator and fell a nearby forest; even Children are forced into labor by an unrelenting, mechanical government.Goodfellow is charged with hunting down the wolves in the neighbouring woods. Parts of the story are a metaphor for any minority group being oppressed; which is what Mave and here mother (who are wolfwalkers-people capable of turning into wolves when they sleep) are. Mave and her mother live in the woods which are being invaded and threatened by the town. Mave wants to leave but cannot because her mother is asleep and her mother's wolf counterpart has not returned. Mave and Robin become friends after Mave heals her hawk Merlin.The plot takes a fun twist when Robin is accidentally bitten by Mave and becomes a wolfwalker herself. Which symbolises becoming one of the minority/oppressed groups. Robin is suddenly forced to deal with the hate,violence and superstition that is felt towards wolves. An irony, because earlier in the movie she herself oppressed wolves; seeing them only as vicious beasts to be hunted down.Robin promises to help Mave find her mother, but is forced by her society and its leader into conformity and obedience. Mave's mother who has actually been captured by the Lord Protector is placed in a physical and metaphorical cage. Upon her execution, she is freed by Robin who decides to break free of her own cage; freeing herself of her towns conformity and rigid rule.Riding the giant wolf who is actually Maves mother; the two make a dramatic escape from the town. Maves mother is reunited with her daughter; but is shot by Robins father; Goodfellow. Robin turns into a wolf; choosing to go with Mave and the wolves into the forest to help Maves injured mother.An epic battle takes place in which Goodfellow throws off his own chains of conformity; choosing to turn into a wolf to save his daughter. The Lord Protector is defeated; Goodfellow redeems himself and all four survive and become a single family-like a wolf pack.In conclusion; this animated movie is one of a kind, and is well worth the watch. The story, metaphors and messages are much deeper than most neigh sayers, and haters think.Don't miss this one!",Wolfwalkers

If you have not seen this film, go watch it. Get a free month of apple TV or something in order to support this film and its studio. They deserve it. If you Like pixar's films like UP, Soul, WALL-E, or Inside-Out, then you will love this film.
The pacing is slow but easily builds into a fantastic climax. The acting and emotion behind the writing is absolutely stellar and I found myself laughing and tearing up many times during the watch. The animation is just so expressive and what you'd want to see if you thought of traditional animation at its best that 3D just can't match. The music is perfectly placed and evokes the best of the emotions.
I'm giving it a perfect because if it got what it deserves, it would be an acclaimed masterpiece akin to Disney's renaissance films.

The main difference between the previous Cartoon Saloon films and the current film right now was the animation drawing which makes beautiful that I expected to avoid some lacked 2D art where it makes the ratings average or a little bit one. I watched this movie couple of times now: seeing friendship between the two female leading characters, the main character has become a wolfwalker by getting bited a wolf, the enemies of townies except Robyn and usually her father because of getting bited by Mebh's mother as a wolf.As of December 11, 2020, this animated movie looking like they overpowered the Disney/Pixar's ""Soul"" which released on Christmas for the best animated movie of the year, but for Oscar both animated movies was still going to decide which one is the best design in animation in able to win that category.As of today, Cartoon Saloon has yet to earned an Oscar but Wolfwalkers could be the perfect film and enough one to get the award in the Major awards ceremony in history. Even though when Soul takes the other awards other than the Film Critics Association Awards, then we'll assume that Wolfwalkers is still the best animated film in the year, 2020.Well done there, Ireland and United Kingdom + US origin!

167,SpockGirl,Passable watch,5,16 December 2020,"I'll just start by saying Song of the Sea was a flash of brilliance. So maybe it's unfair to compare this movie to it. If you are expecting similar quality you may be disappointed. The story follows the same tired trope that so many, many, many movies seem to be unable to avoid when it comes to introducing mythical creatures. Mythical creature exists. A human (or small group of humans) discovers it. The whole world is against the creature and it's up to this person to save this creature from being destroyed by the world (E.T., Pete's Dragon, Water Horse, Super 8, Earth to Echo, Bumblebee, Home, just to name a few). Truthfully I feel this story, even if it wasn't overused, does a disservice to the creatures being introduced. We are so focused on how these creatures don't mix with humans that we can't simply be drawn into the whimsy and fantasy of a mythology. And unfortunately there is precious little to learn about this mythology. The Wolfwalkers are basically werewolves who can heal people and control wolves. That's it. We know that the main Wolfwalker Mebh lives with her mother and a pack of wolves in the forest, but we never find out anything about where the Wolfwalkers come from or what they do besides running around with wolves in the forest and healing the occasional person or creature that gets hurt. But enough about the Wolfwalkers. Let's talk about the rest of the characters. Robin, our heroine, is the stereotypical tomboy stuck in the wrong time period who just wants to hunt wolves with her father instead of scrubbing floors and dusting walls all day. In further stereotypical fashion her father doesn't understand her and frequently refuses to listen to her. They live in a town ruled by the lord protector who is basically the Claude Frollo for wolves. Why does he hate wolves so much? A question for another movie. He also protects his city with gates containing holes large enough for wolves to fit through but that's also another question for another movie. Without going into great details about the plot, overall I was underwhelmed with the cast and how they were developed throughout the film. The plot was almost entirely predictable. The animation itself was decent. Again, maybe not fair to compare it to Song of the Sea, but it wasn't in my opinion, nearly as striking or interesting. Probably my favorite aspect of the film was the score. It was beautiful and I will go back and listen to it again. Overall, a passably entertaining film but not one I will likely bother to watch another time.",Wolfwalkers

177,justasmalltownghoul,A blessing for the animation industry,10,28 January 2021,"I'll be honest, I made an account on IMDb just to give this movie 10 stars. I'm not a critic, nor am I use to critiquing, so take this perspective as you will from a random person who just likes to watch animated movies fanatically.It's probably one of, if not the best children's animated movie I've seen in a very long time. Not only is the visual style absolutely endearing and unique in the best possible way, aided by the visuals the story itself transports you to somewhere magical, and it really touches in that childhood wonder of what it would be like to live amongst (or as) mythical canine creatures. At some point in many children or teenager's lives have they had that ""wolf phase"", and this movie absolutely knocks it out of the park with re-igniting that spark. The story is emotional and can keep itself serious when it needs to be, and doesn't suffer from that awful comedic relief that movies in Disney's renaissance era did. The characters that could be considered comedic relief have reason in the story other than to just keep the young children paying attention; this movie treats children as people that want to be told a story, not shown bland colours moving on a screen to entertain them for an hour. It has soul and passion, and it shows. This is the content that children, teenagers and adults alike deserve more of in the animation industry!",Wolfwalkers

181,plflowerbud,This movie as absolutely gorgeous I LOVED IT,10,27 February 2021,"This movie is beautify animated and deserves so much more than it gets. The plot is heartwarming and exciting. The voice actors are incredibly talented and i CANT get over the sound track. i still jam out to Running With the Wolves. The story revolves around two young girls and are great role models for young ladies. Great conversation starters for for teaching young ladies about the oppresive roles and expectations forced onto women, while also showing these powerful young ladies standing up to powerful men who abuse their power which is an important lesson to bestow on young girls. Seriously i am very upset this movie hasn't won the Oscar it deserves.",Wolfwalkers
182,savagepoems,Love this movie:),8,12 April 2021,"WolfWalkers is a wonderful movie! It drew me in for the very beginning, the vibrant colors bring the movie to life. The storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat and the plot is beautiful and unique. The style of art and animation made me nostalgic for older styles of animation, most of it done by hand and not by computer. But while I do love this movie, there is a few things that leave it lacking the finishing of this type of art. In many scenes you can see the tracing lines for the characters. This makes the animation feel unfinished and was distracting for me. Also in one scene the mouth movements didn't match up with the spoken words. Lastly, a few scenes lack depth, making it seem as there's no distance in between the characters and surroundings. Other than these few things, WolfWalkers is worth the watch. It's beautiful and a wonderful world to dive into.",Wolfwalkers
183,jerviedavid,"A Magestic, Mythical and Magical Masterpiece at its finest and The Return of Old Glory Days in 2D Animation Film can still bring Huge Hits on our today's Modern Evolution Era",10,13 April 2021,"In our times, where some giant animation studios has transitioning from 2D to 3D form to creating new animated films later throughout the years may fell the whole 2D animation might seems to be nearly extinct but some others are recapturing the touch of an old (2D) animation form with a few key different ways or techniques to create a picture as much within the whole story and its plot itself.This film is no exception in all every single margin/s in terms of every best qualities by its entire visuals, art form and direction, every characters are have the pure depiction of its character growth, motivation and progressional development even the entire cast who voiced each one of them are outstanding in all parts, the film's well defined music score including few key featuring special songs for visualizing some of its best moments/scenes of whole movie and the story in this film is truely elegant; the pacing, the tension, the story's depiction plot and its basis, the build-up of character's actions and other's choices they made are fantastic within the story itself and the charm of pure joy and emotional drama are all brilliantly played to absolute perfection.That being said, I adore this film so remarkable that like the wolves need a freedom from any dangers or threats, our real world is what only people thinks throughout in anyone's hopeful minds is to let the whole world make it purely cleaned and safe again from the pandemic brought by COVID-19 virus have made us sick and close in near to death situations but if some of them have it, the best thing is to cure truely yourselves inside and out just like those WolfWalkers can magically healed anything as the wound/s or scar/s may appeared, I visoned this line part for only make good things.Incredibly enjoyed and originally inspired film from the works by entire team of Cartoon Saloon, I'm just an average movie viewer who wants to see a film is a worthy to see it and I'm loved this entire movie if this was on theaters that the whole pandemic wasn't exist but let's face the reality onwards, its recommend to watch as much appreciated for the rest of anyone's days as a period.Imagined or slept myself's spirit into a wolf form: Awooooooo! (This film is a Worthy Masterpiece).",Wolfwalkers

187,danielrojas27,No way Oscar,9,26 April 2021,"I just watched the 93rd Academy Awards and I feel there ir a lot of injustice in the Best Animated Feature results. Not because Soul is a bad movie (there is nothing bad in this beautiful movie), but because there is no better movie than Wolfwalkers, not even close. This movie has more soul, it's perfectly executed and definitely gets to you with every single character, with its music and beautiful animation. I wanna give Wolfwalkers the Oscar for best Animated Feature of the year and arguably, for the best movie of many other years.",Wolfwalkers
188,hasiralm,Wow.,1,6 July 2021,"I like bashing false Christians as much as the next guy but this movie is something else. It feels like the creator hates all Christians, not just that evil bunch claiming Christianity to serve their own egos. I absolutely adored Hereditary & the Suspiria remake & this is the most evil movie I've ever seen.",Wolfwalkers
189,jessicamalchus,Anti-Christian stereotypes put a damper on the stunning animation,6,12 March 2021,"To say I was excited for this Cartoon Saloon installment would be an understatement. As expected, the animation was beyond gorgeous, possibly the best 2D animation I've ever seen, coupled with effective music and dynamic directing (not to mention the genius experimentation with aspect ratio), but the stereotyped characters made it hard to emotionally connect with their arcs. The dialogue was lackluster, interpersonal conflict overly simplified, and therefore repetitive and frustrating, and the anti-Christian themes diminished what otherwise would have been a heartwarming reunion of a finale, however cliché. It felt segregational, the happy, free-spirited family finally liberated from the clutches of fanatical, close-minded Christians with little coherent motivation. All in all, despite subscribing to stereotypes under the guise of portraying the opposite, this was a beautiful film. One hour and forty-three minutes of raw, earthy, enchanting eye candy. Just don't expect the story to blow your mind.",Wolfwalkers

The characters are charismatic and memorable, there is beautiful songs by composers Bruno Coulais, Kílt and and Aurora's music.The plot is simple, but it works. It's my favorite film of 2020.

198,raptorholland,A hidden gem,10,21 October 2021,"A touching animation with an engaging story and a deeper meaning.Even as a person who doesn't tear up easily, this animation pulled at my deepest heart strings through the sheer creativity and passion put into this story.Buckets of creativity and work can be easily seen in each frame of this movie. And the animation style of Cartoon Saloon can be seen to have advanced and improved from their previous titles (which are also amazing). I felt the need to pause each frame as each one felt like a masterpiece. So much expression and emotion illustrated into face of each character. And yet they manage to make each picture flow into each other so magically, its jaw dropping.The story has some engaging twists and turns to it, gripping even seasoned film watchers. The characters are each beautifully designed. And through the expressive animation and talented voice acting of these young girls who played the protagonists, very little character development is needed for the audience to be quickly enveloped in their journey.The story, although initially about humans take over of nature, friendship and how a man can become blinded by ambition based on fear, the story hold metaphors for a deeper meaning about English occupationism in Ireland. I won't elaborate on this too much, but basically, Meabh and the forest represents pagan Celtic Ireland and Robyn and the town represent protestant occupying England. The forest does not welcome and acts hostile towards the town, and the town occupy's and cuts down the forest. And although the two forces push at each other to retreat, the more innocent sides to them, Meabh and Robyn find themselves to be not so different from each other and form a close friend ship. And especially in some of the ending scenes, their friendship really seems to represent how the newer generations of Irish and English can put their ancestors hatred for one another aside, and form peace, friendships and co-existence with their neighbours. And this powerful moral is beautifully expressed in the story i find. This is in my interpretive opinion of the movie anyways.Though the movie left me fulfilled, what was really heart breaking at the end was to see how little exposure the movie made and how little the movie made at the box office. This was due to the movie unfortunately coming out during Covid in 2020. It must have been heart breaking to see these talented animators work years, putting eye-watering amounts of work, time, money, creativity and passion into this fantastic work, just for it to be ruined by something that was completely out of their control. I really hope this masterpiece of animation gets picked up by a big steaming platform, not only so these talented individuals get what they deserve, but so more people can be exposed to this gem.Empathy aside, I am a critical guy, and this movie got a ten due to how I could not find any critique about it and how emotionally evoking and how extraordinarily visually stunning it was. Please give this movie a watch, especially if you are British or Irish this could particularly resonate with you.",Wolfwalkers

202,ed-1138,Another Outstanding Film From Cartoon Saloon TIFF Review,9,13 September 2020,"Wolfwalkers is a story about Robyn, voiced by Honor Kneafsey, an English girl in a small Irish town of Kilkenny, 1650. Her father Bill, voiced by Sean Bean, is tasked with trying to root out the wolves in the forest surrounding the town. Robyn hopes to be a skilled hunter like her father, imitating him with her own cross bow and pet falcon Merlin.This film takes place during a time of war and occupation, Robyn's father working under the tyrannical Lord Protector Cromwell, voiced by Simon McBurney. The Lord Proctor is trying to quell other Irish rebellions and keep the populace subdued. This puts pressure on Bill to quickly take care of the wolf problem, or face dire consequences.Soon Robyn comes into contact with the infamous wolfwalkers, lead by another girl Mebh. Robyn learns that the wolfwalkers are not as bad as she has been led to believe and has to come to terms with this conflict between wanting to be like her hunter father, and protecting the humanity of the wolves and wolfwalker.Cartoon Saloon's style of hand drawn animation is some of the most beautiful I've seen. Every frame has intricate, meticulous details that make their films a unique visual delight to behold. This film has numerous cinematic shots and sequences that push the boundaries of what can be done in the medium.Overall this is an excellent film, on par with their other brilliant feature length animated films The Breadwinner and Song of the Sea. I would strongly recommend anyone give this film a watch.9/10.",Wolfwalkers
