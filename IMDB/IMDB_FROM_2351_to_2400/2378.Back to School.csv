0,MartinHafer,turn off your brain and laugh,6,20 April 2006,"Okay, this isn't a super well-written film, as it has a few lags here and there (such as the ridiculous way Rodney is able to pass the test towards the end of the film). And, at times the acting is totally cheesy and downright poor (Keith Gordon and Paxton Whitehead are standouts for their poor performances). But, despite all this, someone was really thinking as this movie allowed Rodney Dnagerfield to let loose and be funny--giving him enough plot but not too much plot for his brand of humor. Plus, some of the supporting cast, such as Robert Downey and Sam Kineson, are really funny and don't get in the way of the fun.Rodney is a rich guy with not an ounce of class. On a lark, he enrolls in the same college as his son and creates mayhem where ever he goes. Some great laughs plus you get to hear Rodney sing TWIST AND SHOUT.",Back to School
1,bkoganbing,College for knowledge,6,11 March 2018,"Back To School is where Rodney Dangerfield is going. Heeding the advice of his
father who said that no matter how successful you are, you are not a well rounded
person without some education. Wish his dad was running the Department Of
Education today. Dangerfield who is a multi-millionaire tycoon in the clothing
business knows that money talks and he gets it to speak volumes. It's called an
endowment and Ned Beatty as Dean Martin admits him.Dangerfield thinks it would be nice if he and his son Keith Gordon did the 
college thing together. But Keith resents dad just moving in and taking over.
So does business teacher Paxton Whitehead. Whitehead is one of those who
lives up to the motto, those who can't teach. Whitehead is also jealous that
Dangerfield making time with English teacher Sally Kellerman.In her own way Kellerman conveys the same message to him, but it sure is 
packaged better. It's a Dangerfield production and all in the cast kind of play his straight men.
Some of the others include Burt Young who knew Rodney way back when and
is his chauffeur and general fixer of all things, Robert Downey, Jr., as Gordon's
friend and roommate who is loving being part of a faster lifestyle and William
Zabka, bad kid in the Karate Kid who makes life miserable for Gordon.Two small but indelible roles are Sam Kinison as a most unorthodox history
professor and Adrienne Barbeau who is brilliant as the cheating trophy wife of
Dangerfield. How he handles her is priceless.A must for Rodney Dangerfield fans.",Back to School
2,SnoopyStyle,Fun Charming Rodney Dangerfield,6,2 October 2013,"Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield) disobeyed his father about school but still became a big rich success as the owner of Big and Tall stores. He can't stand his high maintenance cheating wive. When he visits his son Jason (Keith Gordon), he finds that Jason isn't the big man on campus like he assumed. Jason wants to quit college. Now Thornton must enroll in school to keep Jason from quitting.It's great to see Robert Downey Jr as Jason's wacky manic best friend. Sally Kellerman is Thornton's love interest. Burt Young is Thornton's body man. Terry Farrell is Jason's object of desire. Keith Gordon is great as the lead. Rodney Dangerfield is his lovable self. This movie is driven by his immense charm.

3,mark.waltz,There's only one man who can get away with being extremely obnoxious.,7,11 April 2020,"And it isn't Paxton Whitehead as a snooty economics professor or Sam Kinison as an ill-tempered history professor. It's Rodney Dangerfield, the king of insults (sorry Mr. Rickles) and self depracating humor. He's the son of a poor tailor who urged him as a youngster to get a college education, advice he did not take. Years later, Dangerfield is the king of tall and fat clothing stores, advertising with insults which could never be utilized in a film script today. His marriage to the trashy Adrienne Barbeau is obviously doomed so he decides to head to son Keith Gordon's college and enroll as a freshman. This creates instant animosity from the dull Whitehead, furious when he loses the affections of potential girlfriend English professor Sally Kellerman who enjoys Dangerfield's outrageous view of life. The hysterically named Dean Martin (Ned Beatty) is reluctant to accept Dangerfield as a freshman at first, but when Dangerfield makes a huge donation to a new campus building, he seems to have no choice. when Dangerfield is accused of cheating, he is given an oral exam by all of his professors, threatened with expulsion. Meanwhile, he takes up with son Gordon on the school swimming team, pudding campus brat William Zabka in his place.This typical 1980's popcorn comedy is a reminder of how much fun movie going used to be, showing off Dangerfield at his best and giving Sally Kellerman a terrific character to sink her breathy voice into. Kinison is funny in small doses, and that is exactly what he is giving here. Whitehead is the typical uppity villain, a staple of 1980's comedies and one the audience loves to see taken down. Burt Young also has some very funny moments as Dangerfield's chauffeur, and character actress Edie McClurg is funny in her one scene as Dangerfield secretary who shows up to take dictation while daingerfield is skipping class. the film isn't realistic in any sense, but with Dangerfield around, who really cares?",Back to School
4,claudio_carvalho,For Fans of Roger Dangerfield,6,17 April 2019,"In New York, Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield) is a wealthy but uneducated self-made businessman. When he divorces his unfaithful second wife Vanessa (Adrienne Barbeau), he decides to visit his son Jason Melon (Keith Gordon) with his driver Lou (Burt Young) at the campus of the university. He finds Jason without motivation to continue his academic life and without any friend but his outcast roommate Derek Lutz (Robert Downey Jr.). Thornton decides to join the university to change the life of his son and he learns that education cannot be bought.""Back to School"" is a comedy tailored for fans of Roger Dangerfield. There are good jokes but Roger Dangerfield is a sort of superman capable of anything. However the cast is great and there is at least a good message in the end.

5,lee_eisenberg,school is cool,10,1 June 2006,"In what might be the apex of Rodney Dangerfield's career, he plays boorish millionaire Thornton Melon, finally attending college. The movie is really an excuse for Dangerfield to be a complete goof-off, containing every silly thing imaginable. Possibly the best line is Thornton's comment about Longfellow.As for the other characters, Keith Gordon does OK as Thornton's son Jason, but Robert Downey Jr. is even neater as Jason's ultra-left-wing friend Derek, who even has a theory about the fascism of football. Sally Kellerman, Burt Young, M. Emmet Walsh, Adrienne Barbeau, Ned Beatty, Sam Kinison and Robert Picardo are all pretty good in their roles (there's even an appearance by Kurt Vonnegut). It's just that this is Rodney Dangerfield's movie all the way. I think that it's quite safe to assert that the Man Who Got No Respect will truly be missed.A hilarious movie.",Back to School
6,Woodyanders,Rodney Dangerfield scores high marks in this total riot,8,29 May 2009,"Blithely loud and vulgar self-made millionaire Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield in terrific lovably crass form) goes back to college to complete his education and help out his son Jason (a fine and likable turn by Keith Gordon). Thornton discovers that college is harder than it looks and must learn to be more responsible for his academic studies or he'll get expelled. Director Alan Metter, working from a bright and witty script co-written by Harold Ramis, keeps the pace hurtling along at a constant zippy rate, maintains a winningly wacky tone throughout, and, most of all, gives Dangerfield free reign to really strut his hilariously hearty and obnoxious stuff. The supporting cast are likewise on the money excellent and effective: Sally Kellerman as sexy and passionate English professor Dr. Diane Turner, Burt Young as Thornton's grubby, loyal chauffeur/bodyguard Lou, Robert Downey, Jr. as Jason's sarcastic misfit roommate buddy Derek, Paxton Whitehead as stuffy, pompous economics professor Dr. Phillip Barbay, Ned Beatty as the jolly, unprincipled Dean David Martin, Terry Farrell as the sweet, fetching Valerie Desmond, Sam Kinison as crazed, irate history Professor Terguson, William Zabka as mean, cocky frat jerk Chas, M. Emmet Walsh as nice guy diving Coach Turnbull, Severn Darden as the flaky Dr. Borozini, and Adrienne Barbeau as Thornton's shrewish adulterous second wife Vanessa. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. has an amusing cameo as himself. Comic highlights include a wild barroom brawl, a rowdy frat bash (Oingo Boingo appear as themselves singing the great ""Dead Man's Party""), and Thornton doing his famously dangerous Triple Lindy dive. Danny Elfman's jaunty score, Thomas E. Ackerman's slick cinematography, and the cool rock soundtrack are all up to speed. But it's Dangerfield who makes this picture such an always enjoyable and often sidesplitting treat to watch: The Rodman's obviously having a ball in a tailer-made lead role and brings a positively infectious sense of incredibly lively and zany fun to the whole film that's impossible to either resist or dislike. An absolute hoot.",Back to School
7,rmax304823,They Don't Respect Him.,5,10 July 2016,"The late Rodney Dangerfield was a stand-up comic full of one liners, a latter day Henny Youngman. (""Take my wife -- please."") He's worked some amusing wisecracks into this movie too.Dangerfield is the wealthy businessman whose son isn't doing well in school, and Dangerfield decides to enroll and help him through. The filming was done at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.It has its amusing moments. When an assignment involves doing an essay on Karl Vonnegut, Dangerfield hires Vonnegut to write the paper for him. But it isn't as keen as it might be, for a couple of reasons.It's not a pure comedy like, oh, ""One, Two, Three"", ""The In Laws"", or ""The Freshman."" The narrative follows the well-worn path of introducing misunderstanding towards the end, followed by a triumphant celebration of the conflict's resolution.That's pretty dreary, and another problem is that Rodney Dangerfield is a stand-up comic, not an actor. He delivers his lines with a high quotient of bluster, as if addressing a night club audience. Whether the lines are supposed to be serious or funny makes no difference.Oddly enough, since it looks like a family movie, Dangerfield comes up with some risqué jokes. In a Jacuzzi with a couple of bimbos he makes a remark about his class in English literature and expresses the hope that they can help him out with his Longfellow.Nobody else puts in a notable performance. How could they? Yet Terry Farrell as the nearly edible girl friend of Dangerfield's son is memorable. She hardly has anything to do, so I wonder why. I'm pondering it, I'm pondering it.",Back to School
8,Quinoa1984,A great comedy,9,27 September 2000,"Rodney Dangerfield makes a great comic effort here as Thornton Melon, a clothing tycoon who sees that his son is hating college, so to help him out (morale wise to the least) he decides to become a student, with hilarious result.  Formulaic in the wrong hands, but in the hands of the Rodfather, we see some great no respect comedy take place with his charm and personality (now that's what I call marine biology).  But the ultimate highlight is the scene with comedian/screamer Sam Kinison who brings one of the greatest scenes in comedy film history as Professor Turgeson (of contemporary American history).

9,BandSAboutMovies,Rodney!,8,11 June 2021,"I always wondered if William Atherton and Billy Zapka had a support group. They're great actors, but they seemed to excel at one role: being the absolute biggest jerks possible. I'd love to see a movie where they were in community service together, trying to right their wrongs, but slowly seething that society is throwing trash at them when they're trying to clean a highway, knowing that they're going to eventually become bullies again, but this time in the service of good. Their case worker? Ron Silver.Anyways, Back to School was dedicated to Estelle Endler, Rodney Dangerfield's longtime manager who guided him in his second time as a stand-up and got him into movies, where he'd find the kind of eternal life that he never could have dreamed of in his youth. To say Rodney had a hard life was life saying he told jokes. So many of them - ""I was so ugly my parents had to hang a pork chop around my neck to get the dog to play with me."" - come from the pain he felt as an abandoned child.Born Jacob Rodney Cohen, he claimed that his mother never kissed, hugged or showed any sign of affection toward him; he was also molested by a neighbor. He legally changed his name to Jack Roy at the age of 19, following the father who left him behind by taking his name and telling jokes and working as a singing waiter in the Catskills. After he was fired, he went into selling aluminum siding.When he went back into comedy in the 60s, he was in deep debt and couldn't get booked. That's when he realized he'd need a hook. His new name Rodney Dangerfield came from a Jack Benny routine - indeed, Benny even visited him once backstage and complimented him on his act - and came from a place he understood very well: he got no respect.In just a few years, he'd headline Vegas and own his own club, a place where young comedians came to get a break. Rodney never forgot what it was like to struggle and gave so many young performers their start. He also kept struggling mentally throughout his life, using marijuana to self-medicate.Unlike his stand-up persona and maybe even the real Jacob/Jack/Rodney, his film characters in movies like Caddyshack and Easy Money were portrayed as successful, happy and popular men. However, they had gone from nothing to something all on their own, thereby becoming the enemy of the ruling rich. They may have money, but Rodney's characters would never truly be part of the 1%.Yet despite their success, the club of Hollywood kept him at arm's length. Dangerfield was rejected for membership in the Motion Picture Academy in 1995 by the head of the Academy's Actors Section, Roddy McDowall. His fans protested and the Academy reconsidered, but Dangerfield then refused their membership.Actually, those fans were really important to him. He was the first celebrity to operate a website and he'd often directly e-mail the fans who visited the site, which had to be a huge surprise.Rodney used to say, ""I tell ya I get no respect from anyone. I bought a cemetery plot. The guy said, ""There goes the neighborhood!"""" That phrase is emblazoned on his tombstone. Man, I get teared up even thinking about Rodney, because while I never met the man, he meant so much to me and my family. I'd get the opportunity to stay up late if we knew he was on Carson and I can still recall a riotous screening of Easy Money where the film was barely audible from all the laughing from my father and uncle.Anyways - Back to School is the big starring role from Rodney, the chance to shine on his own. He plays yet another of his regular guys made good, Thornton Melon. His plus-size clothing stores have made him rich, yet he can't connect with his son Jason (Keith Gordon). After leaving his newest wife (Adrienne Barbeau), he goes, well, Back to School to be part of his son's life. But he does it as only a rich man can, taking over most of the campus and living it up while his son pretty much is embarrassed.This film completely understands the pure comic formula: set up a simple premise and allow hijinks to ensue. To wit: A rich regular guy goes back to school and hijinks ensue.Those hijinks include Burt Young as Rodney's tough butler and best friend, Robert Downey Jr. As his son's punk roommate, Kurt Vonnegut as a guest speaker hired by Rodney, a romance with Sally Kellerman*, a memorable Sam Kinison cameo and the aforementioned Zapka being, well, Billy Zapka.And oh yeah, the Triple Lindy.This film is pretty autobiographical in parts, as Rodney was a diver and truck driver in his youth. I've always loved its message that he may have changed with wealth, but he's remained a kind-hearted man throughout it all. Harold Ramis was one of the co-writers and his comedic sensibilities really help the picture.For metal fans, you can hear Michael Bolton's pre-crooner metal song ""Everybody's Crazy"" during a party scene, and the Alice Cooper song ""The Great American Success Story"" was intended to be in this film. It appears on Constrictor and features the lyrics ""Back to school, he's gonna take that plunge.""We all need more Rodney in our lives.*She lives in Tommy Doyle's house from Halloween.

11,Hey_Sweden,Classic '80s Dangerfield vehicle.,8,3 February 2013,"The late, legendary comedian Rodney Dangerfield shines here in a vehicle for which he also helped concoct the story. He's at his funniest and most engaging, reeling off one priceless one-liner after another; you just can't help but like his character. He plays Thornton Melon, a self made millionaire who created a big business without the benefit of a higher education. When his geeky college age son Jason (Keith Gordon) expresses desire to drop out, not happy with his lot in life, Thornton is motivated to do whatever he can to help out the kid. His brainstorm is simple: enroll in college himself! He manages to buy his way in (donating money to a new business centre) and once settled in proceeds to not exactly take his education that seriously, becoming a life-of-the-party type who sometimes embarrasses Jason. He even has a team of professionals do his homework for him. When he's found out, it's up to him to actually learn some things in order to salvage the whole endeavour. With a screenplay co-written by Harold Ramis, director Alan Metter allows the cast and subsequently the viewer to simply have a lot of fun. The movies' good vibes are pretty hard to resist. There are some brilliant touches; just to name one, author Kurt Vonnegut Jr. cameos as himself, hired to write a paper about his own works, after which a professor exclaims that the writer doesn't know the first thing about Vonnegut! Dangerfields' lines are instantly quotable (""They should donate my body to science fiction!"") and he also has a whale of a time singing a cover of the Beatles tune ""Twist and Shout"" (the same year that Matthew Broderick did this in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""). The supporting cast is equally solid and memorable, especially adorable Sally Kellerman as Dangerfields' English professor and love interest. Also appearing are Burt Young, Robert Downey Jr., lovely Terry Farrell, M. Emmet Walsh, Adrienne Barbeau, ""Karate Kid"" villain William Zabka, Ned Beatty, Severn Darden, the late, great Sam Kinison, Robert Picardo, Edie McClurg, Timothy Stack, and Jason Hervey of 'The Wonder Years'. It's particularly great to see composer Danny Elfman on screen, performing with his band at the time, Oingo Boingo. Overall the movie IS very much of its time, but this is nothing but good if you are like this viewer and retain a fondness for the comedies of this era. If Thornton weren't a basically likable man who just wanted the best for his son, this wouldn't work as well as it does. But it DOES work, and we want to see these characters succeed, and take satisfaction in the way things turn out. The choice of Aretha Franklins' ""Respect"" to accompany the end credits is most appropriate. Eight out of 10.",Back to School
12,Doylenf,Dangerfield romps through college for his kid's sake...,6,7 January 2007,"He may be brash, bombastic, crude and uneducated and doesn't get much respect--but RODNEY DANGERFIELD gets just about all the laughs in this travesty of college life in the '80s. He's seen to it that it's full of memorable one-liners that are just as sassy as any he uses in his stand-up nightclub act.And he's surrounded himself with a cast that really gets into the spirit of things. SALLY KELLERMAN is the vivacious English professor that soon becomes the love of his life; ADRIENNE BARBEAU is his shrewish ex-wife; KEITH GORDON is the son who is not exactly Big Man on the Campus; and ROBERT DOWNEY, JR. is the kind of left-wing activist you can find on any college campus, making the most of a role that he could play in his sleep. For subtlety, if there is any, there's a Dean Martin (NED BEATTY) who allows the uneducated Dangerfield to enter the halls of ivy merely because he's got a pocket full of cash and wants to splurge it on the school's administration, good philanthropist that he is.It's strictly a funfest for RODNEY DANGERFIELD fans -- of which there are many, judging from the comments here -- but it's an enjoyable romp that has some telling truths to say about a variety of college subjects, all the while injecting its own brand of wild humor on every situation. Clever writing makes it all very enjoyable.",Back to School

Rodney Dangerfield is hilarious and his one-liners come one after the other. His best starring role, for sure. Sam Kinison is a riot. Loved every scene he was in.

When his son Jason(played by Keith Gordon) says that he wants to drop out of college, his father makes him a deal; if Jason stays enrolled, he'll enroll himself, which starts a comedic chain of events that will change their lives,(and the college!) forever.Reasonably good-natured comedy has Rodney's bright performance and self-mocking routine going for it, and the hilarious scenes with Sam Kinison as a most unorthodox(and angry) history teacher.

Thornton insists that college is the best thing for him, and to prove his point, he agrees to enroll in school along with his son. Thornton is a big hit on campus: always throwing the biggest parties, knowing all the right people, but is this the way to pass college?.....Here in the UK, Dangerfield is a drama that was shown on the BBC back in the nineties starring some bloke your mum used to fancy, because he looked trustworthy, not a stand up comedian.So the only thing I've ever seen him in is Natural Born Killers. I knew of him, but the only films of this that had anything near a prolific release here were, Ladybugs, Rover Dangerfield, and this.And if it wasn't for him, this would have been your average fish out of water comedy,that would have had mild success, because during this stage of the eighties, college movies were the fashion, so to speak.But he lights up every scene he's in, treating the film like a stand-up routine rather than a narrative, and this kind of hides the predictable fish out of water cliché.But you find all the regular tropes that you would expect....The Professor who wants him to fail.... The Love interest who just happens to be seeing said professor..... The Jock who causes trouble..... The make or break exam.....

To me that one is a lot funnier than this one, which has some good stuff within it, but it just runs to long and gets to sentimental near the end. The story has a successful business man who never went to school with a son in college. Well the son is not having a good time of it and wants to drop out, but his father does not want him to. Well the son says the father did not go so why should he and this spurs the father (played by Dangerfield) to go to the same college to prove a point. There are some funny things initially, but like a lot of comedies of this type it gets to sentimental at times, there are a few lags between the laughs and after a point you just wish it to be over. Dangerfield is mostly funny in this one, though he is at his best near the beginning of the movie while at a party thrown by his wife. A few good scenes when he is first going to college as I enjoyed his first meeting with Sam Kinneson as a professor. Like I said though this movie just seems to go on to long and they have to invent plot points to make the movie more serious than it need be. Sure some people may like this kind of thing, I am just not one of them though. So for me the movie was almost an even split making it not good, but not bad.",Back to School

So I decided to go ahead and give Back to School a chance. I really had a good time watching it, I just miss comedies like this where it was dirty or over the top, it was just plain fun to watch and you have a good time viewing the film. Rodney is such a lovable goof and he always makes it look like he and the cast enjoy making these comedies. The story is so crazy, but so hilarious that it makes you wanna go back to school with Rodney and just have a good time with him and his son.Thornton Melon's father made one thing clear to him at a young age, no matter how old, young, poor, rich you are, education is one of the most important things in life. Well, Thornton has grown into a successful clothes store owner and is very rich and powerful. But when his son, Jason, is discouraged with college, Thornton goes back to school to help encourage his son to get through it. While for Jason it's all studies and trying to fit in, it's all fun and games for Thornton and he's having the time of his life while being the big man on campus.Back To School is a great comedy that I highly recommend, it's all in good fun and Rodney is just such a great comedian. I just loved it when he was going to the college to visit his son and he accidentally enters the sorority house and walks in on a girl showering and says ""Oh, don't worry, you're perfect"", lol, I just couldn't stop laughing. Also I loved Keith Gordon in the film, I can't believe this guy didn't make it big in acting, but he just does such a terrific job keeping up with Rodney.

19,DKosty123,Prime Rodney Dangerfield With Strong Supporting Cast,7,14 October 2005,"This in many ways is the best Dangerfield film. Harold Ramis is genius in working in a lot of Dangerfield quips into the script. The movie flows well, and the supporting cast is appropriate & stronger than any of Rodney's other films.Sally Kellerman is in her best form since M*A*S*H as the English Professor who is Rodney's love interest. Robert Downey Jr. is cast perfectly as a character who resembles him in real life - a drugged out pacifist who protests campus life & all about it without knowing what message he is really sending. The actors who play straight men for Rodney from Dean Martin to the Business Professor are perfectly cast. The late Sam Kinneson is perfect in his small role in this as the History Professor. Wish he could have done more work like this. If there any extra scenes of him cut in this film, it would be great if they could be restored.Harold Ramis, who also did work ranging from GHOSTBUSTERS (trendy) to GROUND HOG DAY (classic), touches show in the script. He works Rodney's character in perfect & the plot shows some of the imagination that makes Bill Murrays classic comedy so great. He allows Rodney to be himself, but frames his character so well that he is a perfect a fit as the clothing store Mellon runs.Special kudos to Mellon's son, as he plays straight very well to his dad. Weakest of the cast is the girlfriend, but she is not given quite enough script to work with here so she makes do with what she has. At least she does OK with it. All the characters show a lot of class & this film is a fine comedy from start to finish.",Back to School

The film is easy enough to digest, but thoroughly ordinary. Note-worthy, extremely winning performance by Sally Kellerman as an attractive literature teacher.   (**)",Back to School
21,ElMaruecan82,"Education is like Karate, we study things not to have to use them in real life...",7,27 March 2016,"A colleague once told me a funny anecdote: while he had successfully passed his 4th grade exam, his cousin, of the same age, didn't have the same luck, so his father made him work as a mechanic. Thirty years later, this colleague was twice my age with half my wage, while his cousin turned out to be the successful manager of six garages all over the town.So much for the merit of education! So when Alan Metter's ""Back to School"" came to its fifth minute, I was immediately thinking of this story. The film opens with young Thornton Meloni, decided to leave school and work with his father, an Italian immigrant who's obviously failed to communicate about the virtue of education. Was that a loss? Not quite: the opening sequence is a brilliant illustration of the American Dream, showing Meloni's ascension, becoming Melon, the head of a 'Fat and Tall' tailor-made costumes empire. Whether it's Melon, or the garage owner, are typical self-made men who didn't wait for any certificate to work hard, they had the talent, the personality, and luck did the rest.And Rodney Dangerfield, with his bulging eyes, obnoxious mannerisms and self-deprecating one-liners, proves that you can be wealthy and successful in business without being corrupted by a snobbish etiquette or pompous arrogance. You can be among the city's top businessmen and speak people's language. There's also no doubt that 'education' isn't his strong suit: he's not comfortable with tuxedos and his driver (played by Burt Young) looks like a truck driver crossed with a moving mug-shot from ""America's Most Wanted"". So, it doesn't come as a surprise that the dinner organized by his gold-digging socialite second-wife gets as disastrous as Mr. Burns presenting his son Larry in the ""Simpsons"" episode that guest-starred Dangerfield. The divorce is quickly set and Melon had one urge, visiting his son, Jason, played by Keith Jordan.Jason is an interesting character, in a frustrating way, despite obvious diving skills inherited from his father, he's just the locker boy, and despite his only friend's encouragement to talk to the girl of his dreams, he's more or less resigned to give up (the friend is played with delightful zaniness by a young Robert Downey Jr., and you could tell the promising talent rising even from a secondary role). Melon can't believe Jason is not some fraternity member or just more popular, much more, that he's about to drop college. But the father's experience doesn't convince on the necessity of education, but like any father, he wants the 'best' for his son, and if it can set an example to his son, he'll also study with him, and pass the same exams.The set-up is as simple as that, but it says something very nice about the film, it's moved by the love of a father for his son, and all Melon's good intentions are built on that, no matter how over-the-top and sometimes disastrous they end up. But Dangerfield plays such a charming, positive, cheerful character that it's impossible to resist to his appeal, he makes everything fun and enjoyable, like a never-ending party, and the embarrassing moments cause more harm to him than his son. And what I liked about the film is that the son likes his father and doesn't mind his presence. In a lesser comedy, the father-and-son relationship would've been the source of predictable gags consisting on one ruining another's fun, but the dynamics is more subtle and touching, and makes the conflict more serious when it happens.And the conflict says a lot about the film's commentary on money and education. The class's jock and Jason's rival accuses him of being an opportunistic nouveau riche benefiting from his father's helps, including him being part of the diving team. Jason thinks his father bribed the coach (played by M. Emmet Walsh, oddly enough, a role he also played in ""Ordinary People""). But the bribe accusation isn't that irrelevant as Melon literally bought his way to the school, through a generous donation, that left the spineless Dean speechless (Ned Beatty makes a funny pairing with Dangerfield) and that didn't please the Business Professor and main antagonist, Professor Barbay, played by Paxton Whitehead. But Melon thinks money is the answer.Melon is actually a pragmatic guy, and in what constitutes the best scene of the film, he deconstructs the whole theoretical approach of Barbay's business course, reminding him there are many extra-costs to count, from the politicians to grease, to the waste disposal, to the unions (and you see students taking notes). Melon has made his way by learning how to make things simple and quick, and if he can buy people to ghostwrite his work, if he can hire someone for the NASA to work on his son's project, he doesn't see any harm to it. Melon is ignoring the basis of education, which, as worthless as it can be (and it can) for a man's success is also the builder of a positive state of mind, something that allow people to surpass their level and learn things that go beyond practicality.like a beautiful English teacher, played by Sally Kellerman, who'd unveil the man's sensitive side.As the fun comedy as it is, ""Back to School"" has the merit to keep constantly in line with its message, not much an hymn to education, but an invitation to enjoy the time that is given to have fun and learn, before getting to the real world. And on a personal level, it reminded me of my preppy and school years which ultimately made me realize that education is like Karate, we study things not to have to use them.Not sure this one-liner would have done well in this comedy but there's one that I immediately put in my Top 10 funniest ever: ""Say hello to my nieces"" (especially when you know the context).",Back to School
22,cricketbat,"Definitely dated, but undeniably Dangerfield",5,19 February 2021,"If you're a fan of Rodney Dangerfield's style of humor, you'll probably like Back to School. For me, it felt like they created a middling father-son story and mixed it with a predictable college comedy just so Dangerfield could do some lukewarm comedy bits. It's amusing at times, but I just can't understand why this was the sixth highest-grossing movie of 1986. How did this beat Ferris Bueller at the box office?",Back to School
23,The-Sarkologist,A Classic,8,13 June 2018,"I never realised how great this film actually is, and that even after all these years there are still some absolutely classic laugh out loud moments. Okay, while this film is clearly a product of the eighties, there is a part of it that could literally put it in any time, and in many cases could still be enjoyed in this post modern, overtly sensitive modern age. Sure, there are some aspects of it, such as when he accidentally wonders into the Sorority and into the girl's showers that would probably not go down all that well here, but there is still a lot of charm about this film.
 It is about a business man named Thornton Melon who made his millions off of selling oversized clothes. He never went to college, and barely finished high school, but he still succeeded. Anyway, he gets rid of his second wife because, well, she was asking for it, and goes to visit his son at college to discover that he wants to drop out. So, to encourage him to slug through to the end he decides to sign up as well and attempt to complete college.
 There is so much to love about this film, yet there is so much that honestly doesn't make all that much sense as well. Yet that's the beauty of this film and that is that there is a lot that really doesn't make sense. For instance, he is in his first economics class and starts sprouting out his own business experience to challenge the professor's own academic, and somewhat unrealistic, theories. In a way it is clearly poking fun at academia, particularly the disconnect between the real world and the class room. In fact he even points out at the end that it is better to stay in the class room, and in one's parent's house than to deal with the cut throat nature of the real world.
 However, the idea of a baby boomer coming back to University isn't all that odd these days. I encountered it the first time I was at university, and I encounter it again today. Sure, there is this element of universities only accepting people with a certain grade into their doors, but if there is one thing that Melon has learnt, and that is that there is not necessarily much that a few dollars in the right hand can solve.
 Yet, what seemed to be quite amusing back then - a nouveux riche guy throwing money around like there is no tomorrow, is something of a concern today. When he throws a few bucks to the cop at the beginning, this simply seems to be Melon just being himself, yet this is nothing short of bribary. As for funding a new business school simply so that he can get into college, well, I'm not sure to what extent it happens, but a part of me isn't all that surprised, particularly with rumours that some universities simply want to attract people from wealthy backgrounds to ensure regular donations.
 In a way it also seems somewhat ridiculous as to how fast he is actually throwing his money around, but that is the nature of the movie. In reality, anybody that free and easy with their money is generally not going to have all that much money for all that long. Yet, as I mentioned, this is the nature of the character - a free and easy guy that is simply friends with any and everybody. In fact, the people who don't like him tend to be those who are jealous of the fact that he has entered a world where he isn't supposed to be - I guess this is the nature of the conflict that seems to exist between the old and new money. Yet he throws big parties, and even goes as far as bringing in Kurt Vonnegut to write his English Lit paper.
 Which is another thing that is really interesting - 'who ever wrote that paper on Kurt Vonnegut doesn't know the first this about Kurt Vonnegut'. Well, I guess that is just a barbed point towards modern academia - some of them wouldn't pick up the fact that an author has written an essay on their own book. There is a story I heard where this actually happened, and in a way I'm not surprised.
 While this film may be a little dated, there is still just a huge amount of charm about it, and it is, surprising, quite funny. In fact some of the lines that Dangerfield comes out with, such as 'how about Fantasy land', are nothing short of brilliant. This is certainly one to get your hands on, even if only once, just to experience one of the hidden gems of the 80s.",Back to School

However with Rodney Dangerfield (in my opinion) it should be considered for the top 75 comedies of all time.Lines like ""I like teachers. If you do something wrong they make you do it again"" are what carry this movie. There's not a lot of them but when they do pop-up they're hilarious.I do believe the director and producers made a mistake not taking Jim Carrey on for the role of the History Teacher because he was too young, because it wasn't a believable kind of movie any way. I must say though that the man who did play the History Teacher did a great job and seeing him teaching was one of the best parts of the movie.So if your into comedies or a Rodney fan don't be put off by how old this movie is like I was because its age, if anything, makes the movie even better.",Back to School
28,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's:The reinvention of Rodney Dangerfield continues..,7,25 January 2005,"Back to School (1986) was a surprise hit for stand up comedian actor Rodeny Dangerfield. After making a big impression with audiences with his spot in the golf comedy Caddyshack and a lead role in Easy Money, his star was slowly rising. But it was this film that cemented his spot in American pop culture as a true icon of the 80's and a transition star.Rodney stars as Thorton Melon (nee Meloni) a successful entrepreneur who had to drop out of school when he was younger to take care of the family business. Years later his son is in college but feel dissatisfied with life in general. After a series of comical events, Mr. Melon decides to visit his son's exclusive university to see how he's really doing. Along the way he decides to give book learning a try.A very enjoyable film. Rodney Dangerfield made the transaction from a stand-up act to an actor. The director wisely let him improvise his dialog and work in some of his material into the movie.

It has Robert Downey, Jr. (who wasn't bad as the campus leftist, who really doesn't understand leftism) who was on the upside of his career, and Ned Beatty and Sally Kellerman and Adrienne Barbeau who were on the downside of theirs, and Sam Kinison who was on the only side of his.

The movie tries to pull off the fact that he has a good heart in the end which pulls the movie up a little bit but not enough for me to recommend it. This is basically the story of a man who's made it in life the hard way without even a high school diploma but decides to follow in his kid's footsteps and tries to attend college himself to help his boy's attitude after he hands divorce papers to his second wife. He starts out doing it the way he knows how -- by buying people and getting others to do the hard work but is caught by the college authorities and has to shape up. Dangerfield & a young Robert Downey Jr. are good for a couple of laughs but that's about it, so it was a nice try but this comic can't carry an entire movie with his schtick, and the basic boy meets girl premises added into the mix for both himself and his son doesn't help the movie much either.",Back to School

This is one of his finest performances in front of the big screen and Back To School made a lot of money. With the solid direction of Alan Meter, the screen writing by Harold Ramis and an excellent supporting cast, Back To School is a non stop party from start to finish, but also a solid well made movie that holds up after repeated viewings. In my opinion, this is Dangerfield's best film by far and the incredible support cast of Sally Kellerman (as Rodney's love interest), the criminally underrated Keith Gordon(as his son, and Keith always gave a memorable performance and good in everything I have seen him in),Burt Young,Ned Beatty, M Emmet Walsh,William Zapka(who previously was seen as a bully in The Karate Kid and Just One Of The Guys), the lovely Terry Farrell, an early performance from Hollywood wildman Robert Downey Jr. Plus cameos from maniac comedian Sam Kinison, Adrienne Barbeau and Kurt Vonnegut appearing as himself.

32,vertigo_14,Head of the class!,6,28 April 2004,"Rodney Dangerfield, Billy Zabka (Johnny in the Karate Kid), Oingo Boingo, Robert Downey, Jr., Burt Young, and Kurt Vonnegut making an appearance as a guy hired to write a report about his own book? How can you go wrong? 'Back to School' is definitely a comedy worth seeing. It is one of the best of Rodney Dangerfield's performances.Jubilent Thorton Melon (Dangerfield) is a pretty wealthy businessman. As a kid (the younger Thorton is played by Jason Hervey), he never put much stock in school. It was enough to know the basics, but he just wanted to inherit the business. Now it's years later. He may be stuck in a rotten marriage, but otherwise, business is great. His son, Jason (Kieth Gordon), is having doubts however, about his future. He's a quiet kid with one solitary friend, Derek (Robert Downey, Jr. as a total fun-loving goofball), he's just a towel boy for the diving team, and even his grades aren't so hot. Thorton is willing to help his son out to put some self-esteem in the boy. So, Thorton dumps his dumb wife and grabs his slick driver, Lou (Burt Young), and off to college they go.Thorton pretty much makes a mockery out of a college education (although I guess that could be done anyways), expecting to coast through the semester by buying off those obstacles along the way. In fact, Thorton seems to be the campus hot shot now in part because of his wild attitude and extreme generosity (he thinks any problem just requires a little cash). He expanded Jason's and Derek's dorm to be high class resort. He hires a huge staff to do the homework for his finals. And, it starts to annoy those around him, especially his son, because he doesn't expect something to come to him so easily (like making the diving team or passing a test), and he doesn't want his dad to bribe someone to make it that easy. He's gotta show his father that once in a while, he has to put some real effort into doing things, or otherwise he's never going to learn anything, much less appreciate it. Thorton's excursion teaches his son to lighten up a little, too.It's a pretty good movie about what a middle-aged rich businessman would do as a college freshman. It's got a big 80s cast with Billy Zabka as the typical jock bully that he seemed to type casted for in those days. Likewise, Keith Gordon, who plays Thorton's son, Jason, is the typical timid geek type that he always seemed to be as well (see Christine). Frankly, I like the guy better as a director. Plus, Oingo Boingo rocks out the dormitory? And I think it is one of the best comedies I've seen Rondey Dangerfield in. His sarcasm is terrific when met with the resistance of the stuffy English professor who doesn't want Thorton around. In fact, Thorton, with his great sense of humor, gets everyone to lighten up.Have a go, eh?",Back to School

It's not quite in the same league as ""Animal House"" or ""Horse Feathers,"" but it's close. The story is filled with Dangerfield one-liners that could easily have been preceded by his trademark line, ""I don't get no respect."" Thornton certainly doesn't get respect from Philip or Vanessa, but they are people who don't like Thornton as a person. Both have issues that involve Thornton's money. Everybody else sees beyond his money and knows him to be a generous, fun-loving businessman. When he's in the bookstore, he not only insists on buying Jason new textbooks, but he announces to the other students, ""It's on me. Shakespeare for everyone."" A host of writers, including Dangerfield on the story and Harold Ramis on the screenplay, maximize the joke potential of every scene. Some of the story is a bit stereotypical, but the film's good nature and consistent humor compensate more than adequately for the stereotypes.Rodney was at the top of his game here. He was cleary having a good time making the movie, and that good time works its way to the viewer. The supporting cast is also excellent. Paxton Whitehead is perfect as an aloof Economics professor who serves as Thornton's diametrically opposed antagonist. Robert Downey Jr, an actor who normally annoys me to end, is hilarious as Jason's punked-out diver-heckling best friend. The late Sam Kinison is especially memorable as a psychotic History professor/Vietnam veteran. You even have a cameo by Kurt Vonnegut Jr (yes, the same Kurt Vonnegut Jr who wrote Slaughterhouse Five). Back to School is a textbook (bad choice of words) example of how great comedy films used to be before the comedy genre became hijacked by disgustingly unfunny toilet humor mavens like Rob Schneider and bland rom-com chick flicks. Everybody is great in this mid-80's comedy classic. Lastly, you have to love a Rodney Dangerfield movie that features a university dean by the name of Dean Martin (the always-wonderful Ned Beatty).

Feeling dejected when his college student son Jason (Keith Gordon) cancels a visit, he returns home to a party hosted by his wife Vanessa. Finally weary of Vanessa's nasty attitude and adultery, Thornton divorces her, and asks his bodyguard Lou to drive him to Jason's college campus. On the campus, Thornton learns from Jason that he's unhappy with college life. He is a towel boy for the diving team instead of a member, is antagonized by team member Chas Osborne (William Zabka), has no friends except for his roommate Derek Lutz (Robert Downey Jr.), and intends to drop out. Thornton motivates him to stay in college by deciding to enroll alongside him. Despite Thornton's lack of academic qualifications, the dean David Martin (Ned Beatty) admits him when he bribes Martin with a donation for a new campus building. Thornton's shenanigans earns him not only the displeasure of Dr. Philip Barbay (Paxton Whitehead), dean of the business school, but also the allure of Dr. Diane Turner (Sally Kellerman) Professor of Literature.After his scene stealing performance in Caddyshack, Dangerfield was given the chance to headline his own movie with 1983's Easy Money, a pleasant enough but forgettable comedy that I didn't feel utilized Dangerfield's talents to their full potential. Back to School reteams him with Caddyshack writer Harold Ramis, and is a much stronger vehicle for Dangerfield as a result. Much like Caddyshack there is a plot with Thorton trying to motivate his son to finish college by attending along side him, and there's some nice moments between Dangerfield and Gordon that add some weight and sweetness to the movie, with that said though the movie's plot is pretty thin and is basically an excuse to link together comic set pieces where Thorton brings some life and chaos to the establishment much to the displeasure of Paxton Whitehad's character Dr. Barbay who makes an excellent comic foil for Dangerfield's antics. Some set pieces have aged better than others, but for the most part the likability of Thorton as a man who throws money around with little regard and has a genuine love of life makes the movie a joy to sit through. Sally Kellerman who played ""Hot Lips"" in 1970s M*A*S*H is also quite good in the movie as Thorton's love interest, and her introductory scene where she reads a poem to the class results in a reaction from Thorton that had me laughing to the point of near suffocation.There are some parts that feel unnecessary to the movie and don't really add much. William Zabka as a stock ""bully"" on the swim team isn't all that funny or memorable and is basically there for Thorton's son Jason to have his own antagonist to give him an arc. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but in comparison to other parts of the movie, it's relatively dry in terms of comedic potential.Back to School isn't one of the all time comic greats, but as a vehicle to showcase Dangerfield's talent and charisma it's second to none. It has hits many of the same beats in terms of plot construction from Caddyshack (minus the classism subtext form that film) but this is a funny comedy which can still get some good belly laughs decades after its release.",Back to School

I was then delighted with laughter my dentist knows how to pick a funny movie! He reminds me of Rodney Dangerfield in a way due to his comical way. Back to School has probably become more of a hit over the years it continues to receive many showings on both basic and premium cable. This movie became such a hit due to the story what better stuff could you ask for as Rodney Dangerfield as a self-made millionaire who becomes a college drop-in. Sure I know this story is far from real everybody knows that a high school dropout doesn't receive admission to college no matter how rich they may be! The scene with the dean (Ned Beatty) when Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield) buys his way admission is just funny and crazy. This comedy is not like other comedies it is not a comedy of parody, Dangerfield makes Back to School funny with his dialogue and actions they are just down-to-earth even though we know the story is so not true. Other characters in Back to School that made this a very successful movie are Keith Gordon he was just right as the goofy son that Dangerfield drops in at college to help out. No matter how different you just wanted to cheer for his character so much as he tried to become a winner. Robert Downey Jr., Terry Farrell, and M. Emmet Walsh all gave great and funny performances. The characters who worked good with Rodney and great with the story had to be Sally Kellerman as the concerned and caring literature professor who makes Thornton Melon learn and understand that life is more than money and a good time. Paxton Whitehead also can't be forgotten as the cold and snobbish economics professor. I just love the scenes when Rodney puts him in his place! The funniest scene in the movie is the face to face between Rodney and Sam Kinison in history class, that is all most sure comedy history! I don't want to forget the great Burt Young who was the best at being the chauffeur for Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield). I'm sure you are like me year after year time after time you know this movie line by line and heart by heart. Back to School is a classic that never gets old, a great movie to have in your video collection. I took the message from this movie as many others should have that life should be fun not serious all the time learn to love to be funny.

The movie is awfully devoid of any plot, or semblance to reality to college life, but this doesn't detract from its overall crazyness.

46,willrams,Comedy With A Story,7,17 January 2004,"Written by obnoxious funnyman Rodney Dangerfield, he wants his son to finish school and get a diploma so he will get ahead, but like father like son, Keith Gordon the actor, he doesn't want to either.  Neither is motivated. But daddy who is wealthy indulges his son as well as himself so they both attend together.  Some very funny situations.  Finally, the son who displays wonderful swimming and diving championship (what a body he has)for graduation.  The crowd urges daddy to be an alternate diving champ, and what a terrific display Rodney shows (maybe it was not really him, but he sure looked real to me).  Both of them graduate together after much hoopla.  What a fun movie this was!  I haven't seen Rodney for many years, but understand from TV commercials he is planning a new show this year.

47,papanloveu,Fun!,6,7 September 2021,Back to School is a classic movie of the time. How could you do any better in casting than Rodney Dangerfield as a self made millionaire going to college to help his son. A lot of classic jokes. This is one of Robert Downey's first movies. It's good to watch it as a throwback movie of the 80's.,Back to School
48,sveknu,Typical 80's fun,8,13 May 2005,"I don't think that Rodney Dangerfield is funny all the time, but in this comedy he delivers perfectly. He fits perfectly it the role of a rich, successful businessman who starts college to achieve a certificate, which he doesn't have. The way he does this in his own, relaxing and laid back-style is great and really funny. A very cool plot indeed, that's for sure. The movie is full of great fun and has many exciting moments in it, so I suggest that everyone check this out for themselves to experience that. The last scene on the diving board is especially great. Totally hilarious, and I laughed all the way through it.",Back to School
49,richspenc,Great classic 1980s,9,12 August 2017,"This was definitely one of my numerous childhood memory movies from the 1980s along with ""Back to the future"", ""The breakfast club"", ""Ferris bueler"", ""Caddyshack"", The ""Karate kid"" films, and the ""National Lampoon vacation"" films. And many others.""Back to School"" and Rodney Dangerfield went together like cake and icing. The movie would obviously not been the same without him, it would've then been another quirky raunchy college comedy.I liked Rodney's (Thorton Melon's) tough friend Lou (Burt Young, who also played a tough ""you better not mess with me"" character in ""Rocky""). Lou didn't hesitate to take care of a bully picking fights in a bar. Even Thornton's son's friend Robert Downey Jr. cries to Lou during the fight ""where you been Lou? I've been getting my a** kicked all over this bar!"" Downey did toughen up some in later years, but not always in good ways.Thornton's son Jason was played by Keith Gordon, another one-hit wonder actor that I never remembered from any other movies. Jason complains how he only got onto the diving team and the fraternity because Pops bought his way onto it all, which was true. Before that, he was no one special to anyone really and shared a little dorm room with his only friend Downy. Jason didn't make the team due to the coach (Emett Walsh) saying he wasn't that good. Rodney has Jason dive doing the ""two and a half"", which does flawlessly, causing the coach to reconsider his opinion. Thorton also reminds him about his legendary dive ""the triple lindy"", which the coach once saw not knowing it was Thorton. Thornton was a man with money from owning his ""Tall and fat"" stores (""well, you're short and ugly"" Thornton tells a wise** kid who points out that he's ""Tall and fat""). Thornton really did buy a lot of Jason's newfound success, including hiring a work team to do his and Jason's homework, much to Jason's dispair and his dad then retorting ""kids, they always wanta do it the hard way"". Also a funny joke is that Thorton hires 'the' Kurt Vahnaghan himself to write his term paper on Kurt Vahnaghan, leading to another funny joke when Thornton's told by sultry teacher Sally Kellerman that ""whoever wrote that paper doesn't know the first thing on Kurt Vahnaghan"". Thorton takes a ""drinks for everybody"" approach at the university, according to Roger Ebert. That he does. He buys everybody's schoolbooks who's present at the college store, he hires staff to do his and Jason's homework, he hires Oinga Boinga themselves to perform live at his frat house party (and pays the police to bring the beer, much to stuffy teacher Paxton Whithead's dismay), and he dedicates a wing at the college to himself while getting dirt thrown on Paxton with the ceremonial shovel.Thorton paying Jason's way also gets attention of the obnoxious William Zabka character, he tells Jason at the swim meet ""your father already bought your way onto the swim team, I'm sure he bought off the judges too"". Zabka does not play the same kind of menacing bully in this movie that he played in ""Karate kid"" and ""Just one of the guys"". Here he plays more of a yuppie snob, and Jason is actually the one that punches him, and Zabka never even hits him back or comes back onto him later about it. It was kinda like the tables had turned here on Zabka. I also like the classroom scenes and still find them funny. The late Sam Kinneson going ""Ahhhhhhh!!!! Aaaaaahhhh!!!!"". The sultry Kellerman (who Thorton very keenly starts dating) who reads a romantic poem with Thorton almost unknowingly standing up in class saying aloud "" yes!! yes!!!"" Then the stuffy Paxton Whithead's business class teaching how to build a business from the ground up and Thorton, who has a lot of hands on experience in the business world and is rich ""Tall and fat"" business owner himself, corrects Paxton making him look bad at every turn. Also is the ""what's a widget?"" line. Answer being ""a fictional product, it doesn't matter"". They should've waited another 20-30 years to mention that one in the world of the internet. No longer a fictional product and widgets do matter.",Back to School
50,jbartelone,"Dangerfield Earns ""Respect"" in this Wonderful Comedy!",8,17 June 2008,"Although I have never been a Rodney Dangerfield fan because of his excessive profanity in other movies and night-club acts, Back to School contains the comic's finest work.The story opens with Rodney's father in a flashback sequence, upset because his son brings home a report card, showing grades that demonstrate that he is not working up to his full potential. Taking his father's advice to work harder, we flash forward many years and Rodney opens up his own clothing store business called ""Tall and Fat."" (Some very funny lines in this part of the film, when we see the ad commercial!) Meanwhile, Rodney discovers that his no-good wife is unfaithful at a party, and Rodney's son, played by Keith Gordon, is having problems fitting in at his college.Eager to help his son, and to instill confidence in himself, Rodney decides to visit him at college, and discovers that they can both help and learn from each other, so Rodney decides to enroll as well!!! He pulls a few strings by using the company funds from his Tall and Fat store to donate a new business building for the school. After being accepted by Dean Martin, (LOL!) Rodney's antics don't suit well with one particular professor, who intends on making life as miserable for him as possible. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the beautiful English professor who is not only teaching his Literature class, but also happens to be dating the business professor who hates him! Dangerfield struggles because all through life, the movie shows that he has been somewhat of a slacker himself. Using his business background, he bribes professional people to do his son's and his homework for him while rapidly becoming the campus party guy. His son Jason has trouble making the diving team, until Rodney pulls a few strings with the coach. Eventually, Jason becomes fed-up, because the entire campus learns what Rodney is doing. Jason wants to do his own work. Father and son have a big blow up fight about this, and the college administrator's determine that in order to prove evidence that Rodney did not plagiarize his work, he has to take oral final exams in all of his subjects.What I like most about Back to School, is that Dangerfield finally shows that he can be funny, without being obscene. There is a soft, sympathetic side to him in this movie that I don't see from him in other films. All of the supporting roles of Rodney's professors are very good. Rodney's jokes about his classroom and exam experiences, are well related from college students, especially if college was/is a trying time for them.The only downside is the song ""Twist and Shout."" It was not only too long, but unnecessary. However, the movie is recommended. See ""Back to School."" It is a fun time!",Back to School
51,japamo,Dangerfield University Lampoon Still Contains Truth,8,14 October 2005,"""Back to School"" is a cherished member of my VHS collection not only because of the late but inimitably immortal Rodney Dangerfield and his outrageous persona, but also because of its laceration of a favorite satiric target - college. ""Back to School"" came out in 1986 -a year after I graduated from Tufts University- and it nearly perfectly encapsulates (if slightly exaggerates) and skewers college life during the heedlessly hedonistic and materialistic '80s.At first Thorton Melon (Rodney's character in the movie) seemingly has two altruistic motives for applying to college: 1) personal improvement, and 2) desire to help his only son Jason (Kevin Gordon) succeed, especially when Thorton discovers that Jason is not exactly the epitome of the BMOC. However, once he essentially bribes his way into college by convincing the venally avaricious Dean Martin (he, he) to let him endow the Thorton Melon school of Business Administration, high school dropout Thorton apparently has it made. One might argue that this scenario is implausible, but given universities' rapacity for more cash, I could believe they would bend the rules to let wealthy Thorton in.Thorton then proceeds to embody every college student's wet dream - to be the perpetually fun-loving slacker who has the dough to show himself and others an endless good time and buy himself out of any trouble! Again, philistine critics may argue that no college would tolerate Thorton's party-boy person; wouldn't the cops arrest him for the voyeuristic dormitory scene or the out-of-control party scene, instead of reprimanding him or bringing Lite beer (remember Rodney was one of the shills for Lite)? However, ""Back to School""'s college satire necessarily must employ a little hyperbole to get its point across.For example, in the classroom scenes with the history professor (the late Sam Kinison) and the business instructor (Paxton Whitehead), the movie does also go a little over the top but also tweaks college for its well-meaning but unrealistically theoretical approach (i.e. head up its a$$ approach) to working and life. Yeah, especially Thornton's take on the corruption and shady dealing it would really take to start a business really do have a germ of truth. Also, the way Thorton ""prepares"" for his classes -his secretary takes notes for him in class and his research team does his reports and homework- is off the wall but also possesses scientific veracity. I'm sure at Tufts and other colleges, some students never went to class and got others to take notes and do reports. However, (and this is one of my favorite scenes from the movie) only Thornton would heft a report created by his research team and crack, ""I dunno; it feels like a ""C""; add some more multicolored graphs""."" And of course only Thornton would hire Kurt Vonnegut to appraise his own work.Nevertheless, ""Back to School"" lets Rodney collide with harsh, poignant reality without sacrificing laughs. Thornton is failing his classes; even the professor most sympathetic to him (Sally Kellerman) suspects him of plagiarism. His son Jason angrily refuses to let Thornton's think tank do his astronomy work. Thornton will be expelled unless he passes a multi-part oral exam (!) by all of his course professors. After a pep talk from Thornton's chauffeur (Burt Young) about Thornton's ""School of Hard Knocks"" life, Jason realizes that just as his dad came to school to show him how to loosen up and enjoy life, he must show his dad how to handle college responsibilities. And isn't that what college is all about - balancing responsibility and fun to have a meaningfully productive experience?Therefore, ""Back to School"" is more than just an ""Animal House"" retread. It uses Rodney's older, wry perspective (and those priceless one-liners) to point out both the absurdity and importance of college life. Heck, I would even recommend high school seniors applying to colleges to give ""Back to School"" a look if only to show them (with a grain of salt, of course) that while college is a worthwhile experience, it's also a unique, unfamiliar world all its own.P.S.: I would advise Cedric the Entertainer to abandon his 2006 remake of ""Back to School"" as an ill-advised travesty.",Back to School

The other is Rodney discussing ""Do Not Go Gentle in that Good night"". Bless Rodney. I saw him at Gator Growl in Gainesville, Florida, back in the 80s: he made a whole football stadium rock with laughter and afterwards thanked us - we were the biggest audience he had ever performed for.

57,snelling,You're a Melon!,8,12 May 2001,"I had forgotten how much ""f""-ing fun this movie is! I remember having enjoyed it when it came out fifteen years ago, but who knew it could stand beside 'Caddyshack' as a timeless comedy about the anti-establishment starring some guy in his fifties?Nowadays you could never assemble such a talented cast for such a light-weight comedy. The best thing about this film is its restraint to avoid easy, obvious jokes. The humor is simple and inoffensive and the characters are believable in this setting. Here, a college world is created that could never be, but we are sucked in because the story makes its own rules and doesn't go overboard trying to be unconventional. Even when the late Sam Kinison as a history teacher is screaming about Vietnam, we buy it because his schtick is funny, to-the-point and above all, brief. The individual jokes come so fast that even if you don't like one specific bit, it's over in the blink of an eye and another zinger is right behind it.The stock characters are all here but they are never boring or entirely predictable. The pretty teacher played by Sally Kellerman is smart and honest. Although she would probably never be attracted physically to someone like Rodney Dangerfield, we can see how she would be drawn to him because of his popularity with the other students. The stuffy business teacher (Paxton Whitehead) would also be on hand to try and keep the rowdies down, but if this were made today, he'd end up in the hospital or worse due to a college prank. The only disappointment is Keith Gordon who plays Dangerfield's son. He's not charismatic enough to play such a major role, but his love interest Terry Farrell is just as bland so they're perfect for each other. Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as the misfit rebel. Something tells me he was really like this growing up which is why he is still thumbing his nose at authority and sitting in jail or rehab as I write this. Adrienne Barbeau is, as usual, playing the busty bitch, but I've been in love with her since 'Maude.' Burt Young as Rodney's chauffeur is basically playing Pauley from 'Rocky' while wearing different funny hats (why the beret at the diving meet?). Ned Beatty and M. Emmet Walsh are also on hand to round out the school faculty with their character acting chops firmly in place (actually I always thought they were the same person).There are classic scenes that will not be forgotten. The young Rodney in 1940. The bookstore spending spree. The secretary taking notes in Rodney's absence. The last-minute studying session. The combining of three dorm rooms into one. The Kurt Vonnegut Jr. scene. I already mentioned Sam Kinison but it bears repeating. The 'Twist and Shout' song. The hot-tub party. And, of course, the Triple Lindy.All this and Danny Elfman and Harold Ramis to boot. If you haven't seen this and you're a fan of Rodney, shame on you. Go get it tonight. Right now!

Or if it were the 1980s, and you needed a rapid-fire quipster who could credibly laugh in the face of a muscled goon and get away with it, how about an SNL-era Robert Downey, Jr.? And what if your comedy was about the college underdogs, the smaller, slighter, offbeat undergraduates, and you wanted to inject a love interest that was gorgeous but also had a little, you know, geek cred? What about (then future) DS9 heart-throbber Terry Farrell?And what if, after you had signed your comedy's straight men, your sidekick, and your love interest, you also landed Ned Beatty, Adrienne Barbeau, Burt Young, Sam Kinison, and Kurt Vonnegut-yes THAT Kurt-freakin'-Vonnegut (to play himself, naturally, it's a film about higher learning) for minor roles and cameos?Pretty ding-dang good, right?

64,DeltaHomicide,"You get my respect, Rodney!",8,20 September 2012,"Rodney Dangerfield exudes great charm, and in Back to School he really shines. A gifted stand-up comedian, Rodney is an old school Las Vegas comic known for delivering scathing, self-deprecating, yet wholesomely witty one-liners. His unique comedy is further enhanced by his bulbous eyes, deep voice and hysterical intonations.Rodney plays Thornton Melon, an eccentric millionaire, doting father, and former college diving competition champ. Thornton went from rags to riches selling men's custom-tailored suits to the big and tall. His only child and son Jason is a freshman in college, painfully single, and having a tough time adjusting to academia, campus life, and his chosen sport - diving. Hilarity ensues when Thornton comes to his son's rescue by enrolling in the same university, partying, throwing money around and slacking off. Then he is literally put to the test, having to pass a series of exams, or get expelled by his nemesis, the pompous Dr. Phillip Barbay, Dean of Students. Thornton also has to learn to stop smothering his son and be a normal dad. Of course, Rodney doesn't do normal, which brings the laughs consistently, with an explosive dive competition-climax that has to be seen to be believed.

+Amazing opening! Not only does it establish and juxtapose the rest of the film, but it exerts a nostalgic, photographic, black and white style not seen for the rest of the film. Although it's disappointing that the director didn't keep the creative mojo up, this single sequence still shows his inventiveness and feels purely his own.+The cast is full of colorful characters! Some with limited screen time still make their character quirks come out, striking it as memorable. These characters are entertaining to watch, and it's through their performance that they actually feel even plausible. This adds sincerity to these roles, where at times they seem to lack on the page.+The cast works well off each other. With each character comes a sense of predictability (I say this in a good way), making us savor and expect each response. Each response then feels like a situation that deserves our attention.+Rodney Dangerfield is charming! Maybe it's his happy go lucky attitude or the fact that he's actually a nice guy with intentions, but he's just really likable and fun to watch. It makes the whole film all the easier to laugh at.+This is a film with respect for it's style. Yes, it's over the top, but it's consistent with that. They give each emotion the right amount of sensitivity. With each joke they always fit it into the context of the story, feeling true throughout.What I disliked:
-There are some dumb plot points. They never truly feel representative of real people, which sucks since the film is full of interesting people who could use depth.

I just had to comment ahead of time that any remake of this, especially one involving Cedric the Entertainer, cannot possibly live up to the original.I'm really tired of Hollywood trying to win over the hip-hoppy, shallow culture by instilling Cedrick the Entertainer in this remake-to-be when the original was done by a classic entertainer. What's next...a remake of Animal House with P-Diddy as Bluto (or whatever he calls himself these days)? Rodney is already turning over in his grave knowing how bad the remake is going to be. Somewhere up there I hope he can convince God to strike the set with thunderous bolts of lightning and 14 inch hailstones. Can't Hollywood leave well enough alone? Rodney, now that you're dead....they give you even less respect!",Back to School
73,TeamECK,A classic,10,25 June 2003,"This is a great movie.  Rodney Dangerfield is perfectly cast (I can't think of anyone who could do that role better).  After this and the Karate Kid, how did William Zabka fade into obscurity?  This was funny back in the theater as a 12 year old, and is funny today.  This would be a good double feature with Old School, but not My 5 Wives.  Any film with Sam Kinison, Ned Beatty and Kurt Vonnegut Jr. is a movie that shouldn't be missed.",Back to School
74,arcormack,"Lots of fun, Rodney makes the movie, full of quotes.",7,24 April 2000,"Bad acting, great punchlines.  Don't watch it as a movie, watch it as a comedy.  Thornton Mellon is afraid he is loosing touch with his son who is to busy as the fraternity brother and swim team champion to see him.  When Thornton, the millionare owner of the Tall and Fat Stores, finds out that his son is actually a college reject, he decides to go back to school to relive both their dreams!!

76,succeed-564-773870,Honoring all those Back-To-Schoolers,9,6 September 2015,"One of the truly, funny if irreverent modern comedies and Dangerfield's best. A fun way to take the load off your new students by showing this. Rodney and Sally Kellerman make a great pair with Rodney his usual bumbling 'no respect' self. Yet he somehow gets the girl, for awhile anyway as the oldest student on campus. Favorite scene is at the swimming pool where Rodney takes quite a dive.This was Rodney's first movie, from 1986 but holds up well, better than most current movie fare.(Surprised at the 6.5 rating). For us, it's almost a 10.

77,bluedragon0110,Surprisingly Great,9,3 July 2006,"I was amazed at how entertained I was when I sat down to watch this older movie!!I usually don't get into the older 80's movies because I usually just don't find them that funny, being that I am more of a child of the 90's but when I caught this one on TV the other day, I didn't stop laughing. Even though the movie is from 1986, the comedy in it is surprisingly hip to even today's generation. I have not really caught much of Rodney Dangerfield's work and I was not a fan of Caddyshack, but everyone it was at the top of their game in this movie!!!If you haven't seen it, rent it and if you have seen it, buy it!!!!!!!",Back to School
78,arthurpwiggle,Absolutely stupid. Absolutely hilarious!!!,8,7 April 2005,"This is probably the best ""stupid"" movie I've ever seen. Whenever I'm in the mood to watch something funny that has absolutely no point at all, this is the pick. I don't really like Rodney Dangerfield but in this he's awesome! Some of the best lines:""Flunk me? Flunk him!""; ""You don't lie to me  you lie to girls.""; ""You can help me straighten out my Longfellow."" You simply can't beat this movie for shear fun and stupidity. Anyway, everyone should see this film, but don't expect anything monumental.What's up with the 10 line requirement? Doesn't anybody appreciate a short comment?",Back to School
79,zoellern,great movie..but can't find the soundtrack on any compact disk,10,10 March 2011,"back to school is a great movie,and it would be nice if they made the soundtrack available to buy,because I would buy it.I'm sure I'm not the only one who'd like to see the soundtrack on compact disk.if anyone has heard anything please post.I have looked all over the internet.I came up empty.I checked amazon,nothing.it must be a hard compact disk to find.I don't think that they have put it on compact disk yet.I'm hoping they will.it would be nice.it's a great movie and has a great soundtrack.I have watched it many many times,it gets better each time.not sure if it will ever go to blu-ray,but that would be nice also.lots to like about the movie,and good actors.rodney dangerfield is always funny,as well as Sam Kinnison.they are both missed.I had no idea that Jim Carrey was considered for the movie.it's definitely one of the top comedy movies of all time.it would have been nice to see Sam Kinnison in more movies.this movie will be remembered as a great comedy,and will make anyone laugh.one of my favorite movies for sure.",Back to School
80,dpdadich,Greatest of All-time,9,26 June 2003,"For as long as I can remember I have been a Rodney fan. Nobody does it like the tie-twisting, constantly sweating, overly depressed Dangerfield. The one-liners in this movie are unbelievably funny. The cops bringing beer to the party, classic. There is NO comedy out there better than this. Rodney Dangerfield is the King of Comedy, and will hopefully remain that way for a long time.",Back to School
81,cwdww,Witty one-liners from Dangerfield carry this intelligent comedy.,8,28 September 2004,"Dangerfield and the story line aside, this movie has some great writing. Lines such as when Dangerfield tries to pick up his English teacher by telling her to give him a call when she has ""no class"" are prevalent throughout. Another great example is the idea that comes from an executive in Melon's (Dangerfield) company. Combatting ""cabbage patch kids,"" who are orphans, the new idea is ""Melon Patch Kids"" - kids who are abandoned. And my personal favorite is when Melon and Kurt Vonnegut tell each other to F#$& off over the phone. My kudos to the writers for an excellent job. I only hope to meet one of them one day, so I can learn from such masters.",Back to School
82,nelsons-1,Awesome,10,23 February 2003,"This movie displays Rodney Dangerfield at his finest. I loved his down to earth character, showing how the REAL WORLD exists compared to the text book. The actors portray a great amount of energy in their characters making the film very lively. This movie goes to show there is nothing a parent won't do to help their child.",Back to School
83,timberway-728-970069,Under-rated work of genius,10,4 November 2018,"While this film seems tame and dated by today's standards, its a pure romantic comedy. It also exposes the dangers of feminism and the ""women's movement"" which is very relevant to what American culture is experiencing today. The film suffers from a flippant and laid back cheesiness, but that doesn't make it any less funny. This film deserves a remake.",Back to School
84,dunn-50631,Screw the previous reviews,9,16 October 2021,"Look at the movie for what it is. It's actually well written comically. It has an actual storyline. Watch this movie today and a lot still transfers if you pay attention. Pseudo remakes have even been done with the concept. Enjoy it for the time it was made, the concepts that still exist, and know it's still a movie. Some people take this stuff too seriously. It's smarter than people realize.",Back to School
85,mekhan50,What a Film!!!,10,1 March 2006,"I think Rodney Dangerfield looks like Dan, and I'm sure Dan would agree with this. More importantly, we're all hoping that Dan fulfils his lifetime ambition and finally stars in a movie (preferably a romantic comedy) with his all-time hero Terry Funk - the greatest wrestler ever to have lived...I think the film should have a cheesy but wholesome beginning in which Dan is walking his pet dog James Waters in a park and then he sees the future love of his life - Terry Funk, who luck would have it is also walking his pet dog in the very same park. Obviously their eyes will meet and there'll be no turning back. Little does Terry Funk know that Dan harbours a dark secret - he's a wannabe jaffa!!! Cue hilarious hi-jinks and such like...",Back to School
