0,SnoopyStyle,fine rom-com,7,21 November 2019,"Far-left journalist Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) quits his job when his paper gets bought out by right-wing media mogul Parker Wembley (Andy Serkis). His best friend Lance (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) brings him to a party featuring Boyz II Men. There he runs into Secretary of State Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) who happens to be his childhood crush and former babysitter. She decides to hire him as her speech writer for her impending Presidential run. President Chambers (Bob Odenkirk) is a former TV actor who only wants to be a movie star rather than run for re-election. Maggie Millikin (June Diane Raphael) and Tom (Ravi Patel) are Charlotte's ever-present assistants. James Steward (Alexander Skarsgård) is the hot Canadian Prime Minister.I like the rom-com aspect. I like the leads' chemistry. The politics get a bit clunky and that is the biggest problem with the third act. I don't see how Charlotte's plan would ever work. It would have been better to allow him to gallantly sacrifice for their love and she can sheepishly suggests the tunnels. The movie gets there eventually. It gets buried by the politics of the situation and dropping the mic sets the wrong tone. Overall, I like the coupling despite a few awkward steps.",Long Shot
1,boblipton,"Charlize Theron, Comic",6,15 July 2021,"Charlize Theron is the U. S. Secretary of State, about to embark on a presidential run with the blessing of President Bob Odenkirk. She's looking for a speechwriter when she happens to run into journalist Seth Rogan, who has just resigned from his alternative newspaper because it was bought by right-wing billionaire Gollum --- I mean Andy Serkis. It turns out they grew up as next-door neighbors and she used to watch him. She gives him a shot and a lot of the usual romcom tropes eventuate.... along with the sort of political fantasy that assumes that Hillary Clinton was hot, kind, forty years younger, had a sense of humor and showed some sign about caring. And that Brooklyn is within the Washington D. C. Beltway. Cute.If it works, it's because of Miss Theron. She has a straightforward style of behavior that made her performance here very funny; it also worked well in A MILLION WAYS TO DIE IN THE WEST, and contrasts nicely with Rogan's mild hysteria. Odenkirk is also very funny as the President.",Long Shot
2,Prismark10,Long Shot,4,17 May 2021,"Long Shot is a slobbish screwball romantic comedy with political undertones.Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) is the Secretary of State, the US President Chambers (Bob Odenkirk) is a television actor who wants to retire to make movies.Field wants to run for president and Chambers tells Field that he will back her.Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) is a Jewish investigative journalist who infiltrates neo Nazi groups. However he is fired when his newspaper is taken over by a Rupert Murdoch type media mogul called Parker Wembley.Flarsky knew Field when he was a lad. She used to babysit for him and Flasky had a crush on her.At a reception Field hires Flarsky as a speechwriter despite his radical views such as environmentalism.The film works best when Rogen plays up the silliness such as jumping through a Nazi flag and finding out he has jumped several floors down a building.It is an odd mix of raunchiness with sly political digs. However it ends up being too conventional, something like a bad mannered The American President but without the smart writing.The movie is too erratic that needed to be sharpened. At time I thought this was Rogen just wanting to show the world that he could pull Theron.",Long Shot

4,kosmasp,Is it though?,8,3 January 2021,"A long shot would be something that you don't actually believe can succeed. Now this is true for a couple of things here. One being the romance of the two main characters and the other the fact Therons character tries to become the first female POTUS - but can she do it while remaining completely innocent and stucking to her guns and convictions? Some at least minor adjustments have to be made for sure, yes? Well the answer my friend ... it might be blowing in the wind, but it is also included in this movie.Rogen and Theron have excellent chemistry and neither of them shy away when it comes to foul language. So anyone with a certain sensitive nature and who has issues with that ... might not be the movie you are looking for. Eveveryone else who isn't easily offended but rather cherishes the ""realness"" in adults talking will have fun in this. Of course not all the jokes work, either because they are too silly (tone) or because they just aren't true (Ice Cubes son can't make the argument he's the only black guest, when clearly in the opposite shot you can see a lot of others - therefor his actually pretty good line about people praising his latest music is undermined - digs or no digs at his father included).If you are not nitpicking then, you can have a good time ... just don't do it in front of you webcam ... just saying",Long Shot
5,jboothmillard,Long Shot,7,19 September 2021,"I may have seen the poster for this movie briefly, I do recall the lead actor and actress (who has not done many comedy movies) who starred in it, and that was good enough reason for me to watch it., directed by Jonathan Levine (50/50, Warm Bodies, The Night Before, Snatched). Basically, President Chambers (Bob Odenkirk) is a former actor who played the President of the United States on television before moving into politics and being elected the President in reality. But he informs U. S. Secretary of State Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) that he does not plan to run for a second term, as he wants to break into movies. He tells her he is looking for a replacement, and seeing an opportunity, she smooth-talks her way to convince him to endorse her as a potential presidential candidate. Charlotte soon meets with her staffers Maggie Millikin (June Diane Raphael), Tom (Ravi Patel), and polling team manager Katherine (Lisa Kudrow) to help Charlotte with her campaign. Meanwhile, Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) is a New York City journalist who has recently escaped an undercover encounter with a neo-Nazi cult. Following this, he learns that that the newspaper he works for has been bought by wealthy media mogul Parker Wembley (Andy Serkis). Fred is furious and quits but cannot find another job. Depressed, he turns to his best friend Lance (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), who takes him to a charity fundraising event where Boyz II Men (as themselves) are performing. Charlotte is also attending this event. Charlotte and Fred recognise each other, as she was his babysitter and secret crush when they were young. While they catch up, Wembley interrupts them to plan a meeting with Charlotte. Fred angrily and loudly condemns Wembley before storming off, falling down a flight of stairs in front of everyone. Charlotte is unhappy with the speeches for upcoming events, as she wants to come across more relatable to the public, perhaps with a sense of humour. After reading columns by Fred, against the objections of her staff, and despite his initial scepticism of her commitment to important issues, Fred accepts Charlotte's offer to hire him as her speechwriter. At a world leaders' summit, Charlotte is forced to revise a speech about an environmental campaign to appease industrialists, but she eventually changes her mind and gives the original speech, which is enthusiastically received. As the two continue to spend time together under the pretext of Fred learning more about Charlotte for his writing, they grow closer, eventually beginning a relationship. Chief of staff Maggie warns Charlotte and Fred that the public will never accept them as a couple. At one point, Wembley pressures Chambers about Charlotte's policies, and she lets off steam by getting high on ecstasy with Fred. A hostage crisis occurs and, still under the influence of the drug, Charlotte has a surprisingly frank talk with the captors and frees the hostage. Even though the incident increases Charlotte's approval rating, Chambers is livid when she chooses to ignore his orders and call him out. He confronts her in his office alongside Wembley. The two blackmail her with a hacked video from Fred's webcam. The hacked video shows Fred discussing his and Charlotte's relationship and Fred masturbating to a video of her onscreen, ending with Fred ejaculating on his own face. Charlotte shows Fred the hacked video and informs him that she has agreed to the ultimatum, and that she wants to introduce him and their relationship publicly once his image is cleaned up. Feeling dejected that she will not accept him for the way he is, Fred refuses to change and they break up. Back in New York, Fred talks with Lance. Fred makes unintentionally racist assumptions about Lance about his political and religious beliefs. Lance tells him that he has been too stubborn with his principles and refusal to consider other people's needs and opinions. During her announcement to run for president, Charlotte changes her mind and opts for her original plan, revealing the blackmail from Wembley and Chambers, and describing the content of the video before its release. The video is released, and Fred is nicknamed ""cum guy"" by the news media. Fred searches for Charlotte and finds her waiting at his apartment. They admit that they love each other and meet the press outside where Charlotte confirms Fred is her boyfriend, with the public being surprisingly supportive of them. A couple of years later, Charlotte has been sworn in as the first female President of the United States, she and Fred are married, with him becoming the ""First Mister"", and they look forward to a positive future. Also starring Alexander Skarsgård as Prime Minister James Steward, Randall Park as Boss, and Tristan D. Lalla as Agent M. Rogen is likeable as the brash unemployed investigative journalist sporting a tatty windbreaker, Theron is the beautiful more serious political figure but does gets laughs at the right moments, especially when she gets high, and Jackson Jr. Almost steals all scenes he features, they are an unlikely but terrific onscreen couple, it is a simple story of a love story between two childhood friends reunited in adulthood while doing politics and stuff, most of the laughs come from the character banter, awkward situations and some over-the-top moments, it is an amusing and worthwhile romantic comedy. Very good!",Long Shot

Romance ensues.Is it just me who suspects that the only person who believes that the character Seth Rogen plays could pull the character Charlize Theron plays is Seth Rogen?This romcom makes some pithy obersvational points abot politics, perception, and relationships, and you quite like both Charlotte and Fred. Also, there are some genuinely funny moments.But - as usual for a Rogen comedy - it is packed from cover to cover with profanity, of which about 10% has any sort of dramatic justification: the rest of it is simply because Rogen likes saying - well, I don't need to repeat it, do I?And, more importantly, I didn't believe a second of it.",Long Shot
9,ferguson-6,Charlize for Prez!,6,2 May 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Romantic Comedies and Political Parodies are staples in the film industry, and have been for many decades. The combination of the three - a political romantic comedy - is a bit rarer, though we have seen it in such films as DAVE (1993), THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT (1995), BULLWORTH (1998), and LOVE ACTUALLY (2003). This latest from director Jonathan Levine (50/50, 2011) has elements of those well-known movies, while incorporating a very high level of raunchiness in a gender-reversed template of PRETTY WOMAN (1990).We first meet Fred Flarsky (played by Seth Rogen) at a neo-Nazi/white supremacist gathering. He's actually a left-wing journalist for an alt-weekly publication, and he's so intent on getting the story that he's willing to get a swastika tattoo and leap out of a second story window. Standing firm on his idealism, Fred quits his job when informed that his magazine has been bought out by Wembley Media ... a right-wing organization in the vein of Fox News. It's an odd opening for the film, but sets the stage for Fred to be reunited with his one-time babysitter Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) who is now the U.S. Secretary of State.When President Chambers (Bob Odenkirk) summons Charlotte for an Oval Office meeting, we get our first glimpse of the filmmakers' parody of the actual current office holder. Chambers is a former TV star who was Golden Globe nominated for acting like a President on his show, and now wants to capitalize on his popularity by transitioning to a more prestigious career ... movies. He's willing to endorse Ms. Fields for the nation's highest office in the next election, and she's all in.Charlotte's reconnection with Fred leads her to hire him to ""punch up"" her speeches with some humor. See, testing has shown that she scores high in most categories with voters - but not for her sense of humor. Despite the protests of her staff, Maggie (June Diane Rafael) and Tom (Ravi Patel), Fred comes on board and quickly works his way into Charlotte's favor - to say the least.Yes, on top of the political jabs and typical Rogen stoner humor, there is an inherent comedic element placing glamorous Charlize Theron and schlubby Seth Rogen in a blossoming romance ... together. The idealism of their characters play a role in the story (she truly believes in her environmental initiative), and the supporting cast is terrific, but this is mostly a show for Ms. Theron and Mr. Rogen to go full-force comedy (including a Molly-trip). We have seen this from him many times, but the real gem here is Oscar winner Theron, who is likely the only actress who could pull off such diverse films as MONSTER (2003), MAD MAX: FURY ROAD (2015), ATOMIC BLONDE (2017), TULLY (2018), as well as this crowd-pleasing political raunch-fest with a political bent.Additional supporting work is provided by Lisa Kudrow, Randall Park, and Alexander Skarsgard (who excels as the awkwardly funny Canadian Prime Minister, in a direct spoof on Justin Trudeau). There is also an unrecognizable Andy Serkis as a frumpy Steve Bannon type, and O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son) is a standout as Fred's best friend ... one with some terrific one-liners and a secret that nearly crushes Fred's idealism. The campaign travels the world (though the film barely takes advantage), and the script from Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah serves up a clever Jennifer Aniston joke, a sight gag to rival THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, and enough bawdy sex comedy that the political satire sometimes fades (but never for long). It's meant to be a crowd-pleaser and it seems to succeed on that; although its greatest strength may be in showcasing another side from the immensely talented Charlize Theron.",Long Shot
10,phd_travel,Funny and sweet,8,17 January 2020,Surprisingly romantic and fun. Great way for Charlize to show her comic abilities. She plays it just right. So nice to see her in a role where she is playing a beautiful woman instead of a down trodden character. She looks gorgeous and smart as Secretary of State. If only there was a politician like her I would vote for her!The story isn't too crude as some Seth Rogen movies have been. Every time it's almost about to get painful it doesn't. Liked the international aspect and laugh out loud one liners in Argentina and Vietnam. There are some spot on current and surprisingly balanced political jokes. Funny how they made fun of Fox News. Liked the way they made a joke about his Republican friend and reigned in his extreme leftist journalist views.Alexander Skarsgård shows he an be funny too.Worth a watch.,Long Shot
11,DKosty123,Put Your Brain Away And Enjoy The Romantic Humor,8,7 May 2019,"Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron are terrific. The script knows enough not to take itself too seriously. The mix of direction and support work. There is adult material. There are silly moments. There's a slower than usual pace.A lot of things about this movie fit the typical formula for a comedy. One thing that fits modern themes is a powerful woman. The difference is this woman does not seem to be a lady who accepts failure and then blames everyone around them for their lack of success. This woman is determined to achieve her goals despite the pressure to compromise.The mix works as this includes not bowing to an acceptable romance in order to keep their career going. It includes not bowing to the pressure of those above in order to acheive their goals. Then there are the drug sequences which provide a release from the serious parts.The politcal themes are played, but not preached. The romance is unlikely, but not without appeal. Then there are the disturbing messages about possible compromises which are something needed today. One thing unusual here, while there is money here, the super rich appear to be more like jokes which is a needed relief from the real world where the rich are all too serious. That's what makes this enjoyable, the class system appears to be stupid. That's why this works, because the class system is stupid, and a big target to make fun of.",Long Shot
12,lasttimeisaw,an enterprising wish-fulfillment on the topical dire political climate in America,7,29 July 2019,"Since presently the traditional mid-range budgeted original adult rom-com is an endangered species in Hollywood, a warm welcome must be issued to Jonathan Levine's LONG SHOT, his 7th feature film and a third collaboration with star Seth Rogen, after 50/50 (2011) and THE NIGHT BEFORE (2015).Present day, Rogen plays liberalistic journalist Fred Flarsky, who rage-quits after his newspaper is bought by Parker Wembley (an almost unrecognizable Andy Serkis), a media mogul he doesn't see eye to eye with.

14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It isn't groundbreaking but it doesn't have to be; it's entertaining.,7,5 May 2019,"'Long Shot (2019)' is the latest in Lionsgate's long line of box-office under-performers, opening with just ten million dollars against its baffling fifty million dollar budget. That's what you get, I suppose, when you open just one weekend after the release of a multi-billion-dollar behemoth. Of course, money isn't everything; the feature is an entertaining romantic-comedy worthy of your time. Indeed, it's precisely because it leans further into its rom-com aspects than its, perhaps presumed, stoner ones that it works so well. Rogan, as usual, plays the underdog but he isn't a 'rough-around-the-edges' man-child who needs moulding into a responsible adult, either through a relationship or a wacky adventure. Instead, he remains true to himself throughout the piece, with his 'learning moments' coming from an understandable place of perspective rather than from some other deep-rooted flaw. To the same end, Theron's journey comes more from how people perceive her and how much she's willing to compromise to achieve her ultimate, altruistic goals. Their relationship is never framed as something that shouldn't work but does; rather, as something that does work but isn't believed in by anyone outside it. The inevitable 'all is lost' is a natural, mutually understandable extension of the central conceit, as opposed to anything arbitrary or overly manufactured - such as a resurfaced lie, an unknowingly recorded conversation or even an overload of naysayer-inspired self-doubt. This means that, while it's not necessarily surprising, it's always believable and, even, slightly unconventional. I mean, it plays pretty much exclusively with the tropes of its genre but it tends to recontextualise them, in a way. Therefore, it doesn't feel clichéd even when it is. Obviously, it's not groundbreaking. It doesn't have to be, though, because it's enjoyable. The leads are both likeable, surrounded by a decent supporting cast, and the flick itself is fairly funny throughout. It's also quite timely, charmingly chiming in on a few key issues in some subtle - and not-so-subtle - ways. Generally, it's a good time. 7/10",Long Shot
15,ThomasDrufke,"Never Thought I Would Believe a Theron-Rogen Romance, Until Now",8,8 May 2019,"After just declaring 'Booksmart' as the surprise hit of the summer, I may have spoken too early, as 'Long Shot' does just about almost everything right in a rom-com. Using some cliches - subverting others, while focusing hardest on developing the chemistry between its leads. Perhaps most unexpectedly, I completely bought into the romance between Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen, and that's not something I ever thought I was going to say. Perhaps a little creepy at times, Rogen's 'Fred Flarsky' is far more intelligent than his other roles, and he's only *sometimes* the butt of the joke. It's only in the third act when things began to tip-toe into Seth Rogen's gross out raunchy style of humor, but at that point you're already invested in the characters enough to reach the end without too many complaints. Make no mistake, Long Shot is a must see.8.7/10",Long Shot
16,Cineanalyst,Contradictions Writ Rom-Com,5,18 October 2019,"The modern rom-com must be one of most stiflingly difficult genres to innovate. Many try to do something different, but end up repeating the same formula and, in the process, often contradicting the values that the story supposedly supports. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" (2012), for instance, is about accepting and celebrating people with different behavioral and mental disorders, but the narrative ultimately conforms to the same rom-com order of unlikely pairing who momentarily breakup over some contrived conflict before the climactic, grand (generally public) romantic gesture, as the leads are supported all the way by quirky side characters (generally, friends or family who are also coded as unlikely pairings--often along lines of sexual orientation or race (i.e. the gay or black friend)). ""Don Jon"" (2013) derided rom-com's as porn, while itself being a rom-com. ""I Feel Pretty"" (2018) celebrates the beauty of women within, but is also about selling cosmetics and a woman who gains confidence by a brain injury causing some sort of reverse body dysmorphia. The list goes on, including this one, ""Long Shot.""Here, we have an attractive politician (Charlize Theron) coupled with, well, Seth Rogen, the two of whom have a conflict between the desire for honesty and integrity in life and their relationship against the conformity and deception of politics. Cleverly enough, the movie's president of the United States is a guy who got elected after playing the same POTUS role in a TV show. Indeed, ""Long Shot"" starts out promisingly enough. Theron and Rogen are fine comedians, as is June Diane Raphael as a political adviser, and there's plenty to laugh at here (Rogen infiltrating a neo-Nazi meeting, Theron leading a hostage negotiation while high). The closer it gets to the conflict and resolution, however--the more the characters supposedly embrace those values of honesty and integrity, the more the movie conforms to the deceptive formula of rom-coms. The race for love, annoyingly escalating score, to the grand romantic gesture and the public confessional displays of love. Never mind that you've seen this a bazillion times before in everything from ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (2001), to ""Hitch"" (2005), to over-and-over again in ""Love Actually"" (2003). And never mind that we hardly learn a thing about that environmental policy or actual politics, let alone love and values, here at all.It's those ideals to be something better or different that is the unlikely pairing with the rom-com, but there are few to no happy endings here. That this one is amusing and clever at times raises it above many others of its type, though. Besides the TV president, Theron's secretary of state performs her campaign based on polling data. The entire romantic comedy begins when she hires a writer, Rogen, who, understandably enough, writes himself into a romantic relationship with Theron. The resolution only happens when she literally goes off script. If only the filmmakers could've approached the genre formula with the same spirit of rewriting.",Long Shot
17,inkblot11,"Although I liked many elements of LS, I was ultimately lukewarm to the entire film, especially its R rated scenes",7,6 May 2019,"Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) is a successful Secretary of State to a President who clashes with her opinions, at times. In truth, this Head of State was once an actor and he doesn't truly enjoy his greatest role. Meanwhile, Fred (Seth Rogen), a muck-raking journalist for a small Brooklyn newspaper, quits when a Murdoch-like media mogul takes over the paper. In serious need of cheering up, Fred's close friend takes him to a glamorous party where Boyz 2 Men are singing. Of course, Charlotte is there, too, and has just learned the President will not seek re-election and wants to throw his support behind HER. But, wait! Fred KNOWS Charlotte from long ago, when she was the 16 year old babysitter to his 13 year old hormones raging self. Back then, she was seriously earnest, ultimately losing a class election by concentrating more on ecology than a ""second prom"" touting opponent. After re-connecting at the party, Charlotte wants Fred to join her election campaign, for his humor is much needed for her new image creation. From jetting to Sweden to concoct a global ecological ""pact"" to being under fire at an island on the Philippines and then whisking away to tango with more nabobs in Argentina, is Charlotte getting interested in Fred romantically? And visa versa? This sometimes pleasing romcom has one beautiful star in Theron and one funny star in Rogen. They are quite charming and fun. The supporting cast has great vibes, too. Naturally, the world scenery is exotically lovely while Theron's costumes are ever-changing and ever-glamorous. But, the script has some problems, especially its R-rated themes which this viewer believes went way too far for comfort. What a shame, for this ultimately left me NOT wanting to view it again. Listen up, Hollywood, sexual tension and comedy does not need blue elements like those found here! But, other viewers may decide differently after attending Long Shot. Therefore, this viewer doesn't want to be discouraging, only wary, so take a shot at this movie if you dare.",Long Shot

20,eddie_baggins,Theron and Rogen ensure this comedy fly's by,6,21 August 2019,"An adult oriented comedy that coasts off the back of the chemistry between its two leads, Long Shot fails to rejuvenate the mismatched rom-com genre in any significant way but with a constantly moving plot and some genuine belly laughs, Jonathan Levine's polished genre entry is the perfect companion to a casual night in on the couch.Honing his skills with similar comedic outings such as The Wackness, 50/50, The Night Before and the lets just forget it ever existed Snatched, Long Shot sees the talented filmmaker provide a rather generic affair that offers up very few narrative surprises (you know exactly where this plot is headed from the moment the whole shebang begins) for viewers but this isn't the type of film that necessarily needs surprises or rulebook change-ups to work and thanks to the on paper intriguing match-up of Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron, Long Shot remains constantly enjoyable.Failing to inspire much memorable material over the last couple of years, it's great to see Rogen team up with someone as talented as Theron, who here let's all her inhibitions go and delivers a knock-out turn as potential American president Charlotte Field, a talented woman just as at home negotiating climate change initiatives as she is rocking some Eminem branded clothing and having a night out on the town.Rogen's usual slacker/joker role isn't stretched in the slightest here as likeable but awkward journalist Fred Flarsky but his everyday charm is perfectly bought to life thanks to the support of Theron's glowing turn, in what's becoming a seriously impressive few years for the actress thanks to stand-out performances in Mad Max: Fury Road, Tully and Atomic Blonde.Theron seems like a naturally gifted comedic actresses, blessed with timing and character beats that only the best of genre specialists can deliver, it's always a joy to watch an Oscar calibre performer get back to the simple yet entertaining heart of their profession and while she's been a part of comedy outings before, Long Shot really does allow her to have time to shine and Theron is more than up for the task as Field and Flarsky's budding romance begins to build around a bunch of rather strange and over the top scenarios.It is a shame that Levine's material doesn't really try to be anything but a by the numbers affair as you get the feeling that both Rogen and Theron would've been more than capable of getting their hands dirty on some off-kilter comedic adventures but in an age where mainstream and cinematic comedy offerings appear to be a dying breed, it's refreshing to see a film of this ilk actually deliver on its promise of laughs and not take itself too seriously in the process.Final Say -Unlikely to leave any type of lasting impression in the years to come, Long Shot is still a likeable and often very funny comedy outing that wonderfully brings together Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen in a match-up that ensures even when the film lurches into mediocrity, they are there to correct the path whenever needed.3 changed laughs out of 5",Long Shot

22,howard.schumann,Enough plausible moments to keep us entertained,7,15 May 2019,"When 38-year-old Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen, ""The Disaster Artist""), a sloppy and unkempt-looking journalist, falls for Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron, ""Tully""), a highly sophisticated, intelligent, and political savvy politician, we know that we must be in fantasyland or in a Jonathan Levine (""The Night Before"") comedy. While Levine's Long Shot challenges believability, there are enough plausible moments to keep us entertained, however, depending of course on our tolerance for specific raunchiness and general run-of-the-mill grossness. Written by Dan Sterling (""The Sarah Silverman Program"" TV series) and Liz Hannah (""The Post""), in the film's opening, the bearded liberal Flarsky does his best Black Klansman imitation by posing as a skinhead at a meeting of the ""White Nation.""Flarsky bellows ""F-the Jews"" in the most unconvincing fashion, but before he can say ""Sieg Heil"" and have a swastika tattooed on his arm, he is unmasked as a Jew and dives for the nearest exit which he discovers at the bottom of a flight of stairs. Expecting to be received as a hero by his publication, ""The Brooklyn Advocate,"" Flarsky is told that the paper has been sold to a right-wing media conglomerate whose CEO Parker Wembley (Andy Serkis, ""Black Panther"") bears more than a slight resemblance to Rupert Murdoch. Rather than waiting around to be fired, Flarsky quits his job and is consoled by Lance (O'Shea Jackson Jr., ""Straight Outta Compton""), an old friend from college who attempts to raise his spirits by taking him to a World Wildlife Fund dance party where Boyz II Men are performing.At the party, Flarsky spots Charlotte Field (Theron), the glamorous woman he remembers as being the babysitter he had a crush on when he was thirteen years old. It turns out that Field is now the U.S. Secretary of State who has just decided to run for U.S. President in 2020 (she must have thought that there weren't enough candidates). Her opportunity presented itself when President Chambers (Bob Odenkirk, ""Nebraska""), her Trumpsky-like boss who was a former TV star, decided to pack it all in and return to the more culturally appreciated role of being a film star.To its credit, Levine shows us how Field has to be almost perfect in every aspect if she is going to defeat a strong male candidate. Focusing on the image women are compelled to present to the public, Field hires Flarsky as her speechwriter on the advice of Katherine (Lisa Kudrow, ""Neighbors""), her image consultant, in order to add some humor to her too-serious persona. Before you can say ""Flarsky and Hutch,"" the two are off on a whirlwind tour around the world to promote her environmental initiative, (the ""seas, bees and trees"" project) which she wants to have 100 countries sign onto, though details of the initiative are blowin' in the windmill.Visiting Hanoi (""Sorry for what we did to your country,"" Flarsky tells them), Buenos Aires, and Stockholm where her trusted advisers Maggie and Tom (June Diane Raphael, ""Blockers"") and Ravi Patel, ""The Black String"") dress Fred up in a traditional Scandinavian get-up that looks slightly ridiculous. In spite of the best efforts of her staff to prevent it, however, the professional relationship between the unlikely pair inevitably morphs into something more, something that those familiar with Hollywood romantic-comedies will have no trouble predicting. Though Field has to fend off romantic overtures from the charming, but superficial, Canadian Prime Minister James Steward (Alexander Skarsgård, ""The Legend of Tarzan"") (Justin Trudeau should sue), it seems like no one can compete with Flarsky for her affection.While they are not exactly the lovable next-door neighbor types, their relationship does have chemistry and we root for them to rise above the material the script saddles them with. Things get really dicey, however, when the Secretary conducts important State business during a drug-induced high, a scene that most definitely will appeal to parents trying to prevent their offspring from using drugs. Thanks to the magic of the movies, however, everything just seems to fall into place for the odd couple who even shrug off the effects of an embarrassing video that surfaces during the campaign of Flarsky performing solo.While the relationship between candidate and speechwriter is often tender, especially a scene in which Flarsky sheds a tear while both are observing the Northern Lights, these moments are unfortunately buried under a ton of F-words and more than a few crass and offensive scenes. With everything going on in our political life today, a relevant satire would have been most welcome. Unfortunately, Long Shot only comes close a few times to scoring any significant satirical points. While its spoof of Fox News hits the target, most of the humor feels like it was written by a horny pre-adolescent. Satire can be powerful when it has wit and intelligence. While the film does flirt with a contemporary edginess, it lacks a coherent message and ends up being ""all things to all men (and women).""",Long Shot
23,matthewssilverhammer,Solid Date-Night Movie,7,10 May 2019,"It's rare that a movie's main surprise is its genre. I assumed Long Shot would be another brilliantly bawdy Rogen outing, full of ad-libbed silliness. As the film unspooled however, I wondered why I wasn't laughing much, the film leaning heavier into light drama and sitcom-esque humor than broad boyish comedy. That's when it clicked: this is just a turn-of-the-century era rom-com with sprinkles of the Rogen formula (drugs, sex jokes, ironic pop music). This realization helped me steadily embrace the film, as the filmmakers uncynically embrace the tried-and-true strengths and clichés of a genre past its prime.
Rogen plays a socially-conscious comedy writer who is hired by Theron, his ex-babysitter and crush, to speech-write for her upcoming presidential run. The two leads are impossibly endearing, and their romance is so sweet and free of meanness, you root for them the whole way. Rogen, who continues to grow as an actor, really settles into his romantically naïve role well, while Theron is a great mixture of strength and grace, with plenty of comedy moments of her own. The script their given is far from knee-slapping, but the gentle good-humor throughout keeps you plenty invested.
Being a political comedy, there are certainly some bigger points to be made here: a Fox and Friends parody, the distance between friendship and politics, governing despite personal issues. But given our current political climate, and the sharply genius satire of projects like ""Veep"", the political aspects fall way too short and come off as much too gentle. For some, this may be welcome, but I would've loved more there. Nonetheless, it's a solid date-night movie that will help you cleanse your Endgame pallet.",Long Shot

She hires him as a speechwriter as she prepares for a run at the White House, but as their relationship becomes more romantic, both begin to worry about the harm his previous articles, his drug use and, frankly, his looks will do to her chances.What to say?

In a parallel story, Secretary of State Charlotte Field learns from the President that he will not seek re-election in 2020, and she convinces him to eventually endorse her. Back at the office, Fred is shocked to learn that it has been sold to a Rupert Murdoch-like, and Fred promptly quits. To forget his sorrows, Fred and his best friend Lance go out on the town. At a show by Boys II Men, Fred and Charlotte run into each other, and it turns out that as a 16 yr. old, Charlotte babysat for Fred, then 13 and with a crush on Charlotte... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Jonathan Levine, who just recently gave us ""Snatched'. Here he brings us a fantasy story of how two people, after 3 decades or so, meet each other again in very different circumstances: the current Secretary of State and an unemployed journalist. It almost as unlikely as, say, the romance in ""Pretty Woman"". In fact, ""Long Shot"" not only reminded me of it, but openly references it (through the music, including Roxette's ""It Must Have Been Love""). For a rom-com to really work, the chemistry between the lead stars must be palpable, and that is certainly the case with Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron, who bring a real spark to the big screen. Rogen is one of the funniest actors of this generation. Theron really surprised me with her comedy skills. Please note: there are a number of sex jokes in the movie, one better than the other. I quite liked them, but if this is not your thing, then please seek out something else to watch. A particular tip o' the old hat goes to Andy Serkes, in a small but very noticeable role as wicked Wembley (the Murdoch-like mogul). The only criticism I might have is that the movie is a bit too long for its own good. A tighter edit might've cut 15-20 min. without losing any of the movie's essence. But in the end it's a small quibble.""Long Short"" premiered at this year's SXSW it positive buzz, and it opened wide this weekend.

29,subxerogravity,Political commentary as it's funnest.,7,13 May 2019,"It's been a while since I've seen Seth Rogen in something funny. I think this more had to do with the fact that he had not made a movie in a while vs. the fact that he has not made a funny movie.
Anyway, like they said in the trailer we have a reverse Pretty Woman situation in which Charlize Theron plays a women so perfect she should be President of the United States, and some how, Fred, a dude who looks and acts like Seth Rogen is able to win her heart. In fairness the two have known each other since they were young so I feel that he has somewhat of an advantage.
The movie has a very progressive message feed to us with a spoonful of laughter. I don't want to sound like I'm not into the message, I am, because it was a message of complete equality that I've been down with, but realistically, it is a comedy that they are trying to tell this important message in and it's a really funny one to so I hope everyone gets the point.
The only down side to this is the fact that their was not enough O'Shea Jackson jr in this movie. Dude has as much personality as his father Ice Cube and I love watching this dude on the screen.

30,Turfseer,Rogen as smug speechwriter attempts belittlement of right-wing opposition through use of crude sexual innuendo,2,14 May 2019,"As a life-long Democrat, one must concede that there are those among us who are so smug in their contempt for the ""other side,"" that they lose sight of a crucial political dictum: respect your opponents (even if you don't agree with them). The failure to follow such an obvious guidepost may have cost Hillary and her team the 2016 election.
Perhaps the most asinine and smug candidate carrying the liberal banner in Hollywood today, is one Seth Rogen. How does such an arrogant and pompous non-entity actually accrue a following? I'm no great fan of Michael Moore (who also manages to win accolades for being smug and pompous), but at least Moore occasionally has some ideas. Rogen, on the other hand, is completely bereft of the necessary intellect to comment on any aspect of the contemporary scene.
Instead, he relies on appealing to the lowest common denominator: crude sexual innuendo; all the while insisting that he is a champion of women (note in his fantasy ""White House tour,"" he unveils a series of paintings of the first Ladies, with calculated approbative comment).
In Long Shot, Rogen is Fred Flarsky, supposedly a witty journalist for the Brooklyn Advocate, the fictional equivalent of the now defunct Village Voice. When the paper is bought out by a Rupert Murdoch stand-in, Parker Wembley, Flarsky promptly curses him out at a party and then falls down the stairs, flat on his face.
Flarsky just so happens to bump into Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron), the secretary of state who works for the Donald Trump-lite President Chambers who soon informs Field he chooses not to run again because he wants to break into movies (he's a former TV star!). Ugh!
Field was Flarsky's ""babysitter"" when she was a high school student and Flarsky just turned thirteen. Somehow Flarsky's so-called embarrassment about getting an erection in front of Field back in the day is supposed to be funny. It isn't. Nor is Field's lame response to Flarsky's lack of control (I guess she finds it all a bit ""cute"").
So when Field hires the newly unemployed Flarsky to be one of her speechwriters after she announces her candidacy for president,, one simply cannot understand why the attractive Field would be attracted to a schlub like Flarsky. But even more cringeworthy is when she ends up having sex with him (one must avert one's eyes from the screen in these moments).
Fortunately there's June Diane Raphael as Maggie Millkin, Field's smart-as-a-button assistant who sees through Flarsky, and has the best lines in the film, putting him down as the fakir he is. Meanwhile, there's more ""cuteness"" from the obnoxious Rogen (I mean Flarsky), who gets Field high on ecstasy and she miraculously negotiates the return of a US spy detained by a Middle Eastern dictator.
Flarsky's big thing is pointing out the lack of transparency and moral scruples of those in government, and he hesitates in joining Field's team at the beginning of the second act ""adventure."" Eventually Field ""disappoints"" him when she caves in to Wembley and President Chambers by agreeing to dispense with a grand environmental bill she had been touting. Of course (you guessed it), she changes her mind (much to Flarsky's unmitigated joy) and suddenly finds herself in the second act dark moment: an extortion bid by Wembley and the Trump-like president.
You're not really going to believe what the two baddies use to blackmail Field. It's a video of Flarsky jerking off! And then when Field ""confesses"" on national TV that Flarsky has been her boyfriend all-along and that he's been the victim of blackmail on the part of the President and the Fox-News clone, the public finds this oh so cute. Flarsky is now some kind of hero and she's elected as the first female president. Oy vey! Only in liberal Hollywood, folks, does a masturbating schnook become the first ""First Man.""
Seth Rogen may be the most repulsive Hollywood celebrity (and so-called actor) out there today. As far as Theron-I see no justification for why an actor of her stature would get involved in a project such as this.

On that basic level it is very enjoyable. Theron and Rogen has a natural easy chemistry, most of the gags land gleefully and moreover the film manages to be romantic in a political setting.But as one looks closer the film is surprisingly layered. Fred/Charlotte embodied the two poles of the ongoing ideological clash in Democratic circles between ideological purity and electoral practicality. It is not at all hard to imagine that, in 2016, Fred was a Bernie Bro and Charlotte was a Hillary supporter. The dramatic tension between them around these points is handled fairly; moreover the film has them meet half way in the battle. The relationship's blocks between them makes the political context more than window dressing. The film is deft political satire as well.This is why, for example, in the early going a joke about how no one cares about policy but Charlotte's weird wave is a problem lands as strong as it does. It is mocking the absurd electoral process we put our candidates through. But more than that it is refreshingly honest about the nonsense woman have to put up with to be successful in the public's eye. The two aspects of the comedy, the rom com and the political critique, blend perfectly, with each enriching the other.Judging by this and Warm Bodies Levine has quite a talent at crafting offbeat and interesting rom coms. He keeps the tone light, and balances the various needs of the screenplay quite well. But he also is aware of the various layers of the story. The comedy is never ruined by the deeper points the script is trying to make and lot of that has to do with how Levine stages scenes. This is a very good film.

Imagine my surprise when I found this to actually be an entertaining and, at times poignant jaunt of a pseudo political romcom.Theron and Rogen are both wonderful for the most part here and the supporting cast around them is exceptional. There are some serious laughs to be had, some touching moments, some legitimate tension too.Until around the third act when it feels like the movie starts to slide back into crass Rogen territory. As soon as Rogen gets something unpleasant in his beard it's officially off the rails and the rating drops for me. There were other ways to progress the story without that and it never fully recovered.Third act aside, this was a surprisingly fun, pleasantly enjoyable experience.

43,valleyjohn,Made me laugh but is half hour too long.,6,28 March 2020,"I'm not a lover of romantic comedies , in fact I avoid them at all costs normally but I saw the trailer and I thought it looked mildly funny so I gave it a go .
It's the story of Fred Flarsky who reunites with his first crush, one of the most influential women in the world, Charlotte Field , he charms her with his self-deprecating humor and his memories of her youthful idealism. As she prepares to make a run for the Presidency, Charlotte hires Fred as her speechwriter and sparks fly.
Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron are extremely unlikely screen partners and that's what gives this film some of its charm .
Rogan plays his usual stoner self and Theron looks gorgeous as usual and they seem to spark off of each other well on screen .
I laughed several times , which is a really good sign as I don't normally in these movies and I thought the dialogue was very clever .
There are some down sides though . A Rom com should never be two hours long . It's difficult to fill that amount of time with laughs and this would have benefited from being 30 minutes shorter also there is one scene that is totally unnecessary. It's similar to that famous There's Something About Mary scene with the hair but nowhere near as funny . In fact it kind of ruins the film because it's not a gross out movie and is uncalled for .
Overall I enjoyed it but it still won't give me a new found pleasure of romantic comedies.",Long Shot
44,truemythmedia,The Romantic Comedy America Needs,8,30 July 2019,"As much as I like Seth Rogen (""The Disaster Artist"") and Charlize Theron (""Tully"") I can't say I ever really get excited for romantic comedies, so this wasn't a film I eagerly anticipated, but I did have every intention of seeing it all the same. I had not at all expected to enjoy it nearly as much as I did. This is one of the smarter romantic comedies to come out recently, but more importantly than that, this film had themes that were not only incredibly relevant but also important. I found myself making comparisons to James L. Brooks' ""Broadcast News"" in terms of the clever way it played with important social issues. While ""Long Shot"" does start to feel a touch long and sometimes the situations are a bit farfetched, overall it feels like the romantic comedy America deserves right now in 2019.",Long Shot

Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron give incredible performances and have perfect chemistry. The majority of the jokes work, Bob Odenkirk, Andy Serkis and June Diane Raphael are all great and O'Shea Jackson Jr. gives a scene stealing and extremely funny supporting performance. It's also well paced and Jonathan Levine's direction is really good. The soundtrack is fantastic and the music by Marco Beltrami and Miles Hammond is good.",Long Shot

47,rgkarim,A Shot In The Rom Com Dark,8,3 May 2019,"In the day of comedy, the name Seth Rogen is a champion for many types of roles and writing. Often the king of stoner comedy, Mr. Rogen somehow takes his dorky looking self to new heights as he makes us laugh our heads off with his similar stories. Today, another piece to his collection is released in the form of a new spin on political comedy, as he teams up with another gorgeous beauty to tell his own Cinderella story. Will this film hold a new form of comedy, or are we just writing another check to a mediocre film? Robbie K back with another review on the film:Long Shot: (2019)Director:
Jonathan Levine
Writers:

Stars:
Charlize Theron, Seth Rogen, June Diane Raphael
LIKES:Good Chemistry
Funny At Times
Cute
Moves At A Good Pace
Good MusicSUMMARY: Despite the looks of Rogen, the guy manages to find some stellar cast mates to work with. Theron and Rogen have a great chemistry that brings the relationship to life, making for an interesting pairing that is fun to watch. Long Shot's central actors bring with it a dynamic spectrum that ranges from awkward crushes to stoned moments and the two really play off each other's energies well. The result is some sensationally dynamic comedy antics that work to inspire and drive the entertainment factor. Clever references, slapstick relief, and even the well-timed simplistic one-liners all work to make a diverse palette for most audience members to enjoy. Long Shot knows how to cater to a wide variety of the audiences.
Yet the comedy is only part of the magic and Long Shot holds a cute atmosphere to it that was promised in the trailer. A love tale graces this film and has that classic nerd and gorgeous woman motif that is both inspirational and just sensational to watch. While it's not the most unique or magical, there is a very cute atmosphere about it and that will draw fans into the mix as well. Making for a good date movie, the love story here is very cute, with some endearing motifs brought in to inspire and chop up the aggressive comedy. With these stories mixed in, it actually puts this tale at a good pace, dropping the mundane circular banter for something with a little more pacing and fun. And finally, the music that is played throughout the movie sort of bridges a good number of decades, with fantastic utilization to bring nostalgia and character to the scene. If you are forced to go to this movie, then hopefully the tracks will keep you interested in the nearly 2 hour run time.DISLIKES:A little preachy
Stoner Comedy going overboard
The Villain character
The Other Love Interest
Predictable
Lazy WritingSUMMARY:When you try to put in good messages, especially ones about changing the world and the social hierarchy, you sometimes run into the world of preachy cinema. Long Shot does those moments in quite a number of scenes going out of their way to put in these moments to be the inspirational piece the story is going for. Not awful, but sometimes a bit much these moments are just the small imbalances that stack up in this movie.
Instead the movies sometimes runs away with its comedy, relying too much on jokes to offset the story for Rogen's usual brand of comedy. Some of the drug humor managed to get caught in the whirlwind of mindless banter, our ""heroes"" stuck in roundabout wonder, in their throngs of substance induced bliss. It is funny at times, but sometimes a bit too deep for me leading to some stale tactics by the tent minute of the scene. Other imbalances for me were the ""rivals"" of Theron's groups that acted as potential story plots. The Villain character by legendary Andy Serkis was a parody of makeup and villains, an antagonist who is there only for a few plot devices, but never serious enough to pose a threat outside of showing off stylized makeup. Also an offset was the potential love interest in the form of pretty Canadian prime ministers. A few mindless laughs and some rapid character introduction, this character held some potential that was lost in the grand scheme of comedy. These unnecessary characters just made for threadbare plots that further endorsed the predictable plot that this movie held.
Yet it's the lazy writing that gets me as the biggest limitation. I'm not talking about the story or the clever comedy, that's actually good for me. No, it's the monotonous cursing that is famous in Rogen's arsenal of films. Long Shot suffers from focusing too much on the slander, replacing much of the human vocabulary with genitalia descriptions that are laced with consistent swear words. If you can't get enough of the F bombs, you've come back to the familiar watering hole, but Long Shot still needs some unique flavor added to the punch to escape this weakness for me. By not expanding up on the vernacular some of the scenes were missing their true potential due to again stale verbiage.The VERDICT:Long Shot is fun and surprisingly cute, making for a fun film that holds some story and laughs to behold. It's a generational movie that will speak to many, and the broad audiences it will appease too makes for a promising movie night out with the group. Yet, the factor that holds it back is some unnecessary plot devices, some wasted characters, and the fact that once again lazy writing seethes in to the clever jokes at hand. It makes for a generic comedy, but sometimes those are the fun films to share with friends and family, so long as they can handle the crude humor. So therefore, grab your friends and hit this delightful film up as a group, but otherwise stick to streaming for this for it lacks much of the theater worthy quality.My scores are:Comedy/Romance: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5",Long Shot
48,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Long Shot,6,11 May 2019,"If Judd Apatow directed a movie with less gnawing improvisation, a 90's soundtrack, and a little less grossness, he'd get 2019's appropriately titled Long Shot (my latest write-up).Seth Rogen in ""Shot's"" lead role, morbidly strikes again. With his groggy looks and his nerd-like swagger, Rogen gets to be frisky with yet another beautiful leading lady (Charlize Theron, Rose Byrne, Katherine Heigl, Elizabeth Banks, etc.). Basically this is Seth Rogen at his most Seth Rogen. Expect the usual F-bombs, drug sightings, cultural references, slapstick physicality, and scruffy, manic behavior.In Long Shot, Seth plays out of work journalist Fred Flarsky. While taking in an intimate Boyz II Men concert (I forgot those guys still existed), Flarsky runs into his old babysitter named Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron). Field is now the U.S. Secretary of State and is soon planning on running for President. Charlotte needs a good speechwriter and decides to hire Fred based on his previously strong penning. The two of them unlikely hook up and plot devised conflict ensues. Yup, the sight of neon-dressed Rogen and any hot babe truly reminds me of Beauty and the Beast. Natch.Containing a healthy bit of the raunchy and a healthy bit of heart, ""Shot"" is like a combination of Knocked Up, Hitch, and 2010's She's Out of My League. Long Shot's director (NYC native Jonathan Levine) creates a well-structured comedy that's vague on political nuances, rife with masturbatory innuendo, and short on overall plausibility (there's hardly a chance Field and Flarsky would ever get together let alone trot the same sidewalk).Still, Theron and Rogen give decent performances and there's a few mild laughs to be had. In truth, you sorta wish Rogen would revert back to his brilliant supporting gig in 2015's Steve Jobs but you'll settle for this umpteenth, typecast turn. Bottom line: Long Shot gets a mixed review as it ""longs"" to be a simpatico rom-com. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",Long Shot
49,Easygoer10,Pitiful Garbage,5,18 January 2020,"Whoever Charlize Theron's agent is should be fired for finding the worst films for her. The last time O saw a film with her I liked was ""Prometheus"" (2012) by director Ridley Scott. Skip this garbage.",Long Shot
50,elliotjeory,Enjoyable comedy,7,27 July 2019,"A Well made modern comedy, above average, both Rogen and Theron were funny, it was a bit too rude in places which kind of spoilt it. If you've seen it you know what I mean. Other than that it's a good film.",Long Shot
51,fntstcplnt,Long Shot (2019),7,12 January 2020,"Directed by Jonathan Levine. Starring Seth Rogen, Charlize Theron, June Diane Raphael, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Andy Serkis, Bob Odenkirk, Ravi Patel, Alexander Skarsgård, Randall Park, Tristan D. Lalla. (R)Left-wing journalist (Rogen), fresh out of a job, chances into a meeting with his former babysitter, the current Secretary of State (Theron), who asks him to join her team as a speech writer...and because it's a movie, they will, of course, eventually fall for each other. After a shaky start--how many other rom-coms open with someone unleashing a hate speech tirade?--the movie settles into familiar territory for Rogen's likable stoner schlub shtick and the feel-good fantasy land of Hollywood romance and politics. Though the plotting can be frustratingly predictable and far-fetched (both leads probably wouldn't even be employable by the end of the movie in the real world), the dialogue, jokes and interplay are above average, with Rogen and Theron making for a winning pair and solid supporting work coming from Jackson (Rogen's best bud), Odenkirk (the president) and Serkis (unrecognizable as a Rupert Murdoch/Roger Ailes type, though he looks more like Steve Bannon). Plays it pretty safe on the political side to avoid excessive feather-ruffling (Theron's major platform/initiative is based on environmental preservation); the expected jabs at the Fox News stand-in are hyperbolic but still on-target.68/100",Long Shot
52,nancyldraper,Elevate!,7,3 May 2019,"I was sold by the premise of this movie - Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen, ""Say WHAT!?!"" (Not to dismiss the appeal of a good Canadian male). But, unfortunately, our exported Canadian comedians seen to excell in low humour, so, I was prepared for this RomCom to be a little crass (even Seth said it was ""dirty"") but a whole plot point revolves around a pretty lewd act! Get with it, Canada. Elevate! We can be funny without rolling around in the mud. Otherwise, it was funny, it was adorable, it was full of human moments and real connections. Charlize was stunning. Good supporting cast with some stellar choices. (Charlize was sold enough on the project to be one of the producers.). I enjoyed it when I wasn't grossed out. So I rate this production a 7 (good) out of 10. It could have been an 8 (great) if it hadn't stooped to the lowest, male, preadolescent form of humour. {RomCom}",Long Shot

The two of them trying to inject some life into this dead horse of a relationship just didn't work as there just was no believable chemistry and I am not even clear if these actors like each other.If you can suspend any critical faculties you have for 2 hours and 5 minutes then you may enjoy this movie, I was mildly entertained whilst I watched it but just felt cheated afterwards.",Long Shot

57,jon.h.ochiai,"""It must have been love...""",8,6 May 2019,"Brilliantly hysterical Charlize Theron's Secretary of State Charlotte Field crouches in the basement under terrorist siege with her speech writer Fred Flarsky, who's been in love with her since he was 12 years-old. Charlotte instructs Fred in the Navy SEALS calming technique: taking deep breaths in 4 seconds intervals. Charlotte counts, ""One. Two. Three. Four."" Fred follows her lead. It works. So does Director Jonathan Levine's ""Long Shot"" as a whole.At times, Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah's screenplay is politically clichéd and 'in your face' raunch. ""Long Shot"" is about the compromises we tolerate, where we sell out, and ultimately when we take a stand. That made me laugh out loud, and touched my heart.Charlize plays Secretary of State Charlotte Fields, the strikingly beautiful and smart protégé of hilariously irrelevant President Chambers, played by Bob Odenkirk. The President, the former TV Actor, informs Charlotte that he will not seek a second Presidential term, so that he can pursue his movie acting career. WTF? According to Dan and Liz's narrative only two TV actors have ever made that transition: George Clooney and Woody Harrelson. ""Not Jennifer Aniston."" Too funny.Clearly, the Secretary of State persona is a loose homage to Hilary Clinton. Very loose. Charlotte is about to embark on her global trip to enroll countries in her environmental treaty, what she dreamed of back when she was 16 years-old. The President will endorse Charlotte in her run for the White House. Yeah.Image consultant Katherine played by goofy wit Lisa Kudrow tells Charlotte and her Campaign Manager Maggie, played by hilariously duplicitous June Diane Raphael, that Charlotte polls over 90% in all appeal metrics, except relatability. Even her lame hand wave needs a makeover. Charlotte actually reads synopses for ""Game of Thrones"" instead of actually watching episodes. OMG. So Charlotte needs a speech writer to humanize her persona, i.e. loosen her up.Seth Rogen plays Fred, the slovenly tapered cargo pants wearing renegade journalist for the ""Brooklyn Advocate"". However, when the ""Advocate"" is bought out by billionaire Parker Wembly, played by unrecognizable Andy Serkis with Rupert Murdock caricature zeal, Fred quits.Fred calls his best buddy Lance, played by funny charismatic O'Shea Jackson Jr., who owns his thriving business in DC. Lance gives his company the day off so he can party with Fred. Lance brings Fred along to a political fundraiser featuring his favorite group Boyz II Men, unfortunately sans Bobby Brown. Dancing to their favorite 90's band, Fred and Charlotte recognize each other.When Charlotte was 16 years-old she was 13 year-old Fred's babysitter. He had a mad crush on pretty Charlotte. 13 year-old Fred suffered the nearly devastating hormonal mishap. Yet, young Charlotte was kind to him. That's something that Lance wisely reminds Fred of in his recall. In a ridiculous confrontation, Charlotte discovers that Fred is a journalist.On the ride back home, introspective Charlotte tells Maggie that she was Fred's babysitter. Fred was this brilliant, kind, funny kid. ""He had a chip on his shoulder.""In Director Jonathan's narrative, Charlotte hires Fred as her speech writer. Yeah, this is romantic comedy. Predictably Charlotte and Fred fall for each other, as unlikely as it seems. In a quiet moment Fred asks Charlotte about her love life. According to media tabloids she's dating Canadian Prime Minister James Steward, played by handsome aplomb Alexander Skarsgard delivering the most insane accent. That's all show. She smiles, ""Guys don't want to date a woman more powerful than them. It's a real d**k shriveler."" Amen.Amidst the formulaic trials and chaotic tribulations, Charlize and Seth share genuine kindness for each other as Charlotte and Fred. There's the subdued prejudice for the beautiful woman falling for the 'not so hot' dude that Writers Dan and Hannah illustrate. Of course with all due respect to Seth. Still, this lands.In ""Long Shot"" what's in your heart really matters. Watching the glorious aurora in the night Stockholm sky, Fred tears up. Charlotte looks at Fred, ""Are you crying?"" Even with all his bluster and tantrums, Fred has a good heart. Seth Rogen is so vulnerable and authentically funny. Charlize is the comedic surprise. She never tries to be funny. She just is. Charlize radiates Charlotte's sublime sadness and compassionate soul. Confessing to Fred, ""I'm so afraid..."" touches your heart.Charlotte and Fred slow dance to her favorite teen song ""It Must Have Been Love"" by '90s band Roxette. They don't say a word. We get it. In ""Long Shot"": It must have been love. That's what keeps you watching. Just saying.",Long Shot
58,Holt344,"Long Shot will please many Seth Rogen fans, it's well written and well shot, entertaining from start to finish",9,5 March 2021,"Long Shot is a comedy film directed by Jonathan Levine and written by Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah. Produced by a couple of people and among them are Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron who also portrays the main characters.
The plot follows Fred Flarsky, an unemployed journalist who at a party reunites with his childhood crush, Charlotte Field and the spin here is that she's now the United States Secretary of State and runs for the Presidency. Charlotte hires Fred as her speechwriter and sparks fly. It's the chemistry between the two actors, Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron that makes it work. The script and overall writing is fantastic, jokes are on point and executed perfectly. Incredible directing, and I think it helps a lot that he have worked with Seth Rogen before.
O'Shea Jackson Jr, Andy Serkis, June Diane Raphael, Bob Odenkirk and Alexander Skarsgård also star. It's a cast with many acclaimed actors and they do a great job with mixing the drama and comedy.The film, Long Shot is actually well shot, cinematography is incredible and I didn't expect that.

As was Andy Serkis as a heavily-made up, older media mogul who is trying to use his wealth to manipulate the events from behind the scene - this character (and make-up) was a ""swing and a miss"" for me. But, fortunately, neither Serkis nor Odenkirk have much screen time, so it was more of a ""distraction"" than an ""annoyance"" for me.I mention the Director - so I better give credit to Jonathan Levine (the awful SNATCHED with Amy Shumer and Goldie Hawn) - I have not really enjoyed anything else he has Directed, but I have to give him credit for this one - he brings ""the funny and the crude"" without going overboard, driving the story efficiently while putting in enough yuks and (surprisingly) heart in this movie along the way.Now...don't be fooled here...there is quite a bit of ""crude, lewd and rude"" behavior and jokes (a crucial plot point hangs on a ""sex act""), so don't expect a gentile, Cary Grant/Katherine Hepburn battle of the sexes.

62,Anurag-Shetty,Best adult comedy/romantic comedy I've watched in a long time.,10,28 May 2019,"Long Shot tells the story of Fred Flarsky(Seth Rogen). Fred who is a journalist, happens to meet his childhood crush, Charlotte Field(Charlize Theron), after many years. Charlotte is one of the most influential & powerful women in the world. She decides she wants to run for the next presidential election & hires Fred to write her speeches. They reconnect & develop feelings towards each other.Long Shot is a laugh-out-loud/feel-good/realistic film. Director Jonathan Levine perfectly portrays the common truth that opposites attract & looks don't matter, when it comes to making a lasting connection with someone. This movie feels like the present day adult comedy version of Notting Hill(1999). It is not at all predictable & though it follows the general rules of your standard rom-com, it takes the highly twisty route to get to the end & keeps the audience guessing throughout. The comedic & the emotional set pieces, have been wonderfully balanced throughout. The natural & super adorable chemistry between the two leads, is what makes Long Shot unforgettable. Charlize Theron is spectacular as Charlotte Field. Seth Rogen is mind-blowing as Fred Flarsky. Theron & Rogen light the screen on fire, in all their scenes together. June Diane Raphael is awesome as Maggie Millikin. O'Shea Jackson Jr. is amazing as Lance. Ravi Patel is brilliant as Tom. Bob Odenkirk is hysterical as President Chambers. Andy Serkis is perfect as Parker Wembley. The supporting cast is superb. Long Shot is a must watch for rom-com/adult comedy fans & fans of Charlize Theron & Seth Rogen. Go, fall in love with Charlotte & Fred.",Long Shot
63,spookyrat1,Scores a Bull's Eye!,7,22 February 2020,"Have to admit that fairly deep into the first act I had real misgivings about Long Shot. Seeing Seth Rogen's loud-mouthed, uninhibited journalist Fred Flarsky, jump out of a third floor window, diving head-first into a car roof and then just getting up rubbing his head had me worried. Later he tumbles down a steep flight of stairs and is similarly largely non-inconvenienced. I started to wonder whether I was watching a 21st century brand of Three Stooges slapstick violence humour.Thankfully the film seems to mature a lot more after Flarsky joins his former babysitter (Charlize Theron), now the United States Secretary of State Charlotte Field's staff, as a speech writer. Make no mistake Long Shot doesn't sport the most sophisticated humour you'll ever see or hear. But it is a funny rom-com with a satirical political edge that is quite entertaining in a completely different fashion to the 1994 Michael Keaton/Geena Davis comedy Speechless, to which it bears some passing semblance of similarity.Seth Rogen plays ... Seth Rogen. No real surprises there. But Charlize Theron is just splendid as the ultimate professional politician, who just longs to also have a raging time some distance away from the spotlight. Theron's versatility is just incredible. She proved she could do comedy with A Million Ways to Die in the West and she just reinforces those comic credentials with her playing of Charlotte Fields. Her sex scenes with Flarsky and her diplomatic hostage negotiation have to be seen to be believed. They are really funny and highlight Theron's great timing, sense of fun and ability to realistically self-deprecate. In a similar vein, in briefer scenes, Alexander Skarsgård as James Steward, the Prime Minister of Canada seems very happy to send both himself and Justin Trudeau up too. The support cast in fact is very good all round, though I thought Andy Serkis just seemed to slip in to pantomime villain mode way too easily, when playing Parker Wembley, an international media mogul with a close relationship to the POTUS.For a film of this nature, it probably does wind on for too long at just over 2 hours, though it does have an imaginatively, different rom-com happy ending. I'm really surprised it wasn't more of a commercial success and I recommend a look, despite it's slow start.",Long Shot
64,Danusha_Goska,"Lousy Script, Obnoxious Character, Zero Chemistry",2,14 May 2019,"2019's ""Long Shot"" starring Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron is an attempt at a romantic comedy crossed with a gross-out schlub movie. Average guy Fred Flarsky meets and falls in love with presidential candidate Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron). We've seen similar movies before, like ""The American President"" with Michael Douglas and Annette Benning, and ""Dave"" with Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver. Those movies were mildly pleasant. ""Long Shot"" is wretched.I feel as if the eff word was used in every sentence spoken by every character, from the first scene to the last. My memory is probably exaggerating but that's how it felt. Why did the screenwriters use the eff word so much? Did they think it would attract cool viewers? Dunno. It's really just lazy writing, meant to replace a real script with real characters, emotions, charm, and laughs, none of which the movie has.Being the schlub who scores the hot girl has been Seth Rogen's calling card since ""Knocked Up."" Me, I just don't get it. It's not just that he is overweight, out of shape, and minimally groomed. He plays drug-addicted, arrogant, narcissistic, immature slackers so convincingly that it's hard to believe that that is not his real personality. In ""Long Shot"" his Fred Flarsky is unbearably obnoxious. He has an exaggerated sense of his own self-importance as a guy who writes left-wing articles for a small newspaper. The rest of the world is corrupt but he is pure and righteous. At least that's what he thinks.Charlize Theron doesn't help. In her scenes, all I kept thinking was ""Wow. She's 43. Her face looks picture perfect."" And that's *it*. When I watch Katharine Hepburn in ""Woman of the Year,"" another movie about a hyper-achieving woman mating with a schlubby guy, I get into the emotions of her character and the challenges of any such relationship. Theron's icy, flat performance just made me focus on how picture perfect her face is. There's no chemistry between Rogen and Theron.The script never offers a clue as to why these two people are together, not for a one-night stand, not to consider a long-term relationship. The limitations of a script that consists mostly of the eff word.The closest the movie comes to any complexity is to have Charlotte (Theron) ask Flarsky (Rogen) for the drug MDMA. They get high together, and, thanks to the drug, Charlotte is able to solve a world crisis. That's not how MDMA works. MDMA sometimes kills people. Just saying.High achieving women like Charlotte deserve so much better than to be depicted as flawed and in need of a schlubby guy with a drug stash to rescue them from their own high achievement. Oh, and by the way, the title ""Long Shot"" is not just a reference to the chances of Fred and Charlotte becoming a happy couple. It's also a reference to Fred having an intimate encounter with his own right hand, an encounter that ends up staining his face. And you get to watch that, if you are foolish enough to buy a ticket to this movie.",Long Shot

You can sort of see how the bad ingredients choose the wrong path and make the stinker elements of this show.
Seth Rogan's already shown us he doesn't know when he's good or bad with his horrible Netflix special, and to be fair he is capable of delivering good stuff, but then he drops some really stinker elements, and they're here too. The gross out content, F bombs to the point of making avid swearers feel uncomfortable, he undoes anything good he delivers these days and looks like a guy on the downward leg of his career.
Hard to know what Charlize Theron was thinking with her character.
I think we can definitely put a large part of the blame for the bad parts on the shoulders of director Jonathan Levine who hasn't really made a good movie as his rating demonstrate, yet his projects keep getting green lit.
There's so much bad stuff to unpack here, is this really where we're at for culture, is this the most we can expect from 'smart' comedy. There's not nothing in here, but it so haphazard and scattershot for every good point and insight there's 5 downer elements you have to wear with them.

68,bob-the-movie-man,The definition of punching above your weight!,8,30 April 2019,"Long Shot is a comedy featuring the 'out-there' journalist Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogan) who has been holding a candle for the glacial ice-queen Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) for nearly twenty years. At the age of 16 she was his babysitter. Always with an interest in school issues, she has now risen to the dizzy heights of secretary (""of State"") to the President of the United States (Bob Odenkirk). With Charlotte getting the opportunity to run for President, fate arranges for Fred to get hired as a speechwriter on the team to help inject some necessary humour into Charlotte's icy public persona. But in terms of romantic options, the shell-suited Fred is surely #punching isn't he?Getting the balance right for a ""romantic comedy"" is a tricky job, but ""Long Shot"" just about gets it spot on. The comedy is sharp with a whole heap of great lines, some of which will need a second watch to catch. It's also pleasingly politically incorrect, with US news anchors in particular being lampooned for their appallingly sexist language.Just occasionally, the humour flips into Farrelly-levels of dubious taste (one ""Mary-style"" incident in particular was, for me, very funny but might test some viewer's ""ugh"" button). The film also earns its UK15 certificate from the extensive array of ""F"" words utilized, and for some casual drug use.Romantically, the film harks back to a classic blockbuster of 1990, but is well done and touching.The sharp and tight screenplay was written by Dan Sterling, who wrote the internationally controversial Seth Rogen/James Franco comedy ""The Interview"" from 2014, and Liz Hannah, whose movie screenplay debut was the Spielberg drama ""The Post"".Behind the camera is Jonathan Levine, who previously directed the pretty awful ""Snatched"" from 2017 (a film I have started watching on a plane but never finished) but on the flip side he has on his bio the interesting rom-com-zombie film ""Warm Bodies"" and the moving cancer comedy ""50:50"", also with Rogan, from 2011.Also worthy of note in the technical department is the cinematography by Yves Bélanger (""The Mule"", ""Brooklyn"", ""Dallas Buyers Club"") with some lovely angles and tracking shots (a kitchen dance scene has an impressively leisurely track-away).Seth Rogen is a bit of an acquired taste: he's like the US version of Johnny Vegas. Here he is suitably geeky when he needs to be, but has the range to make some of the pathos work in the inevitable ""downer"" scenes. Theron is absolutely gorgeous on-screen (although unlike the US anchors I OBVIOUSLY also appreciate her style and acting ability!). She really is the Grace Kelly of the modern age. She's no stranger to comedy, having been in the other Seth (Macfarlane)'s ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"". But she seems to be more comfortable with this material, and again gets the mix of comedy, romance and drama spot-on.The strong supporting cast includes the unknown (to me) June Diane Raphael who is very effective at the cock-blocking Maggie, Charlotte's aide; O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Fred's buddy Lance; and Ravi Patel as the staffer Tom.But winning the prize for the most unrecognizable cast member was Andy Serkis as the wizened old Rupert Murdoch-style media tycoon Parker Wembley: I genuinely got a shock as the titles rolled that this was him.Although possibly causing offence to some, this is a fine example of a US comedy that delivers consistent laughs. Most of the audience chatter coming out of the screening was positive. At just over 2 hours, it breaks my ""90 minute comedy"" rule, but just about gets away with it. It's not quite for me at the bar of ""Game Night"", but it's pretty close. Recommended.(For the full graphical review, please visit One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks.)",Long Shot
69,kjproulx,A Great Rom-Com for Many Reasons,9,5 May 2019,"Many romantic comedies have become the punchline of jokes over the last decade or so, due to their predictability and the fact that there's only so much you can do with stories like this. Long Shot is the latest in a long line of romantic comedies to hit the big screen and I don't usually say this about many films, but I truly believe this is a movie every mature viewer may love. Most movies have a niche audience who loves them and even if the majority is in favour of them, you're likely to see more average reviews than glowing ones. For Long Shot, I think the general consensus will be very positive and here's why.Following an unemployed writer in Fred (Seth Rogen) as he runs into his lifelong crush, Charlotte, who also happens to be secretary of state and running for President of the United States, Long Shot is simply about the unlikely bond these two form. From silly antics to genuinely hilarious sequences, to an overall emotionally resonant story, this is a film that doesn't exactly transcend its genre, but ultimately does the absolute very best with the material set-up in the first act of the film. I would be lying to myself if I didn't call this one of the most enjoyable films I've seen all year so far.We've seen coming-of-age movies time and time again that has the main slob of a character ending up with the famous or smarter character that seems out of his league, but Long Shot puts a nice spin on it while caring very much about the characters presented on-screen. It also didn't hurt that these characters share some very heartfelt and hilarious lines of dialogue. Known for writing some pretty hilarious episodes of television, the writing duo of Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah worked wonders for this film in my opinion. I've also been a huge fan of director Jonathan Levine, so in a way, this movie may have been made for me.In the end, Long Shot is a movie that's tailor-made to be a crowd-pleaser and while it does fall into that a little too much at times, there's very little to complain about here. From start to finish, Long Shot holds his smart comedy on its shoulders, while delivering an emotionally satisfying overall film. It's easily one of the best movies I've seen so far this year, but I also think that because it's a feel-good movie that had me smiling throughout the entire duration. While not groundbreaking for its genre, Long Shot is absolutely worth seeing.",Long Shot

73,msbreviews,Rating: B+,7,3 May 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Who would have thought that the first (positive) surprise of the year would be a movie starring Seth Rogen in a romantic-comedy?! This genre has been having trouble for the past few years (only a handful of films are worthy of high praise), but Long Shot's amazing cast called my attention at the beginning of 2019 when I was organizing my watchlist of the year. I genuinely love Rogen type of humor, and Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses of the 21st century. Add three more terrific actors like Bob Odenkirk (President Chambers), O'Shea Jackson Jr. (Lance), and an unrecognizable Andy Serkis (Parker Wembley), and you have yourself a clear path to success.So, what's the missing key ingredient? A well-written and compelling story, which is the number one problem with rom-coms of today. Most of these movies go straight to streaming services since they're the easiest ones to produce. Just gather a reasonably decent cast, put together a cliche narrative about how two people with nothing in common end up together through the most unlikely and dumb plot devices, and you have a low-budget ""success"". Long Shot's premise follows a variation of that concept and it still carries the trademark conventionality, but it's the chemistry of its leads, the hilarious comedy and the beautifully-written screenplay that makes this one stand out.The dialogues don't feel forced, a large portion of the jokes land, and the best compliment I can give to this film: it took itself seriously, and it worked seamlessly. There's a heartfelt message to transmit to the viewers, and it's delivered in the most realistic possible way. The romance doesn't seem far-fetched or born out of nowhere. Instead, it has a wonderful arc, filled with real-life relationship moral dilemmas and difficult decisions. Everything that any character says either makes sense or makes you laugh.The cast is brilliant as expected. Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron's chemistry is palpable, and it's one of the reasons why the romance part of the movie works. They clearly had much fun on-set, and that's visible on the big screen. Rogen provides most of the laughs, but he also proves that he can be dramatic if necessary. Theron is just impeccable. She simply can't act a single line of her script in a way that's not perfect, whether it's a romantic scene or a comedy bit. Her range is on display throughout the entire runtime, and Jonathan Levine should be extremely grateful as a director to have such an outstanding actress to work with.In addition to all of this, there's one thing I never expected to be praising right now: the makeup department. Before the film, I knew that Andy Serkis was on the cast, but I completely forgot what his role was. Without an ounce of exaggeration, I truly believe that it's almost impossible to recognize him as Wembley if you don't know beforehand that he participates in the movie. When I re-checked the cast members, I remembered that he had a role indeed, and I was almost as surprised by the discovery as I was with how much I enjoyed this film. O'Shea Jackson Jr. also delivers a hilarious performance while Bob Odenkirk doesn't really have much screentime to shine.This is one of those movies that you can't precisely point out obvious flaws. A flawless film doesn't mean it's a perfect 10/10 movie. It just means you really don't have any major issues with it. If every single aspect of a film is just ""good"", then the movie is ""good"", not ""incredible"" or ""amazing"". That is how I view Long Shot. It's an extremely entertaining rom-com, undeniably one of the best I've seen these past few years. Even though the main concept follows the genre's traditional storylines, its well-written screenplay, hilarious comedy bits, and outstanding protagonists make a surprisingly serious story remarkably entertaining.It's a fast-paced 2-hour runtime that I recommend to anyone who just wants to have a good time at the movie theater.",Long Shot

77,CANpatbuck3664,"Theron and Rogen's Chemistry Surprises, The Amount of Solid Laughs Doesn't",9,8 May 2019,"Romantic comedies are generally formulaic, some genres have more clearly defined rules than others, but romantic comedies almost always have the same beats and hit the same tonal notes. Some are more family-friendly and some are more raunchy. Rarely do we get one that breaks the mould and while Long Shot can't be wholly original, it does have a different type of feel. They don't hesitate to drift into a dirty joke but they pull back more times than not (there's a joke with Fred and a webcam that goes the whole nine yards but that's about it). The first and maybe most important compliment that I can give Long Shot is that it manages to be hilarious on almost a scene to scene basis. There's some really funny bits around a sudden attack on a hotel they're staying at or when Fred awkwardly tells Lance about his ""romantic"" encounter with Charlotte when they were kids. I was laughing consistently throughout Long Shot and so was the majority of the theatre.Long Shot isn't afraid to enter a political discussion and I think it makes some solid points. Instead of being largely pointed one way, the argument in the movie centres around making an effort to compromise. In today's difficult political climate, that's a refreshing take and I respected the movie for it. We also get some comments on the difficulties of being a woman in a position of power. There's some solid arguments in the movie about how women are perceived, the way they have to act and the standards they have to keep. Its kept around the boundary but they're poignant nonetheless. The movie dances around serious commentary (or aspects of politics that we have largely read into), its more interested in being a romantic comedy so if you're looking for some bite in the material, I think you'll be disappointed. But the lighter touch they decide to take sprinkles in enough without being overwhelming or overstepping and it shows the creative team knows enough without being too heavy handed.I've always liked Seth Rogen and generally I like his movies (he's not without a couple of missteps, but no one bats 1000). His performance in Long Shot is him operating firmly in his wheelhouse but he's doing good work. He has a lot of chemistry with Theron (surprisingly) and he does his part in selling their relationship. Theron has always been an excellent actress but this is a unique turn for her and a noteworthy one. She's really funny in this and her performance elevates the material, I never would have known she had comedic chops. June Diane Raphael walked a fine line in her part, she could have been a one-note downer of a character, but she manages to deliver some funny lines and bring a little warmth as Charlotte's campaign manager. O'Shea Jackson Jr. is a surprisingly versatile performer, he does solid work as Fred's best friend Lance. I also wanted to give credit to Alexander Skarsgard as Prime Minister James Steward. As a Canadian, in the beginning it felt a little cheap with them just parodying Justin Trudeau but Alexander's performance grew on me as the movie went on and he managed to also elicit a few laughs from me in his short amount of screen time.Long Shot does so many things well but it still can't escape certain genre cliches. They do as good of a job as they can trying to create organic conflict between Fred and Charlotte but I couldn't help but feel Fred was just being too whiny and self-involved. The pair of them make interesting characters but they still can't completely sell fighting between them as a two-sided argument. We also have to get the typical ending from one of these movies, I get that audiences expect that but it did feel like someone added too much sugar and made the ending a little too sweet.I went into Long Shot with high expectations from all the critical praise and those expectations were met. The movie has some gut-busting funny moments, a pair of stars that can play off of each other and sell their implausible romantic relationship and some sweet scenes that give the movie a little heart. It still can't check all the boxes but I think it gets the job done and gives you something to chew on leaving the theatre. Its the best romantic comedy I've seen in a few years (this includes the solid but sadly overrated Crazy Rich Asians) and I think its worth checking out in theatres. The studio screwed up releasing it so closed to Endgame but if you can tolerate Rogen's brand of comedy, don't be afraid to go see this as a funny date movie.",Long Shot

Conversely, Charlize Theron's filmography is immeasurably more eclectic, with Monster (Patty Jenkins, 2003), Mad Max (George Miller, 2015), The Road (John Hillcoat, 2009), as a non exhaustive list. Therefore, a cinematographic association between this eternal teen and this gorgeous bomb is rather unlikely and completely devoid of any alchemy.

87,PyroSikTh,2019's Game Night; Better Than it Should Be,8,26 December 2019,"I hate RomComs and I hate Musicals. There are exceptions to every rule, of course, but generally I find both so full of cringeworthy clichés that I just can't get through one and genuinely enjoy it. And yet the trailer for this one instantly grabbed me by virtue of placing Seth Rogen into a RomCom. Sure, he's been in RomComs before, but they're almost always exceptions to the ""I hate RomComs"" rule. The concept of a deadbeat journalist hooking up with his babysitter now she's a hugely successful politician just seemed prime for mining. And yet I dodged it in the cinema, because it was a RomCom.And yet, Long Shot is like the other Seth Rogen RomComs in that it is far better than it has any right to be. It's more than just your regular RomCom, and they really did mine the premise for both humour and romance. Fred is a journalist for an anti-government, anti-conglomerate news outlet who finds himself out of a job when said news outlet gets bought out by a Rupert Murdoch type. Charlotte is the current Secretary of State, poised to take over the presidency when the current president decides not to run again, but first she needs a big win on an environmental bill by geting a hundred countries to sign on. As she embarks on her world tour, she needs someone to write her speeches, and persuades Fred that her environmental stance is not just political grandstanding, but something she genuinely cares about, and asks him to write her speeches for her in an effort to up her polling chances.For the most part, at its absolute bare bones, Long Shot is as typical a RomCom as they get. On the world tour Charlotte and Fred spend increasing amounts of time with one another and rekindle a missed opportunity from when they were kids. She teaches him how to smarten up and behave on a world stage, while he helps her loosen up and come back down to Earth as a normal human being. Of course Charlotte's aides aren't too happy with Fred's sudden appearance, or the relationship brewing between them, warning Charlotte that he is not a good fit for her presidency appeal. Naturally this causes rifts, particularly that end-of-second-act conflict that plagues these kinds of movies. But of course being a RomCom, it has a nice feelgood ending as they get together despite everything, and it pays off for both of them in the most cliché and unrealistic way. Yeah. It's a RomCom.But Long Shot is more than that. For starters the comedy is absolutely on point. Love or hate the guy, Seth Rogen definitely knows what he's doing when it comes to humour, and Long Shot is no exception. He plays his usual stoner type, but quickly establishes that he's not just an apathetic deadbeat. He takes his journalism seriously, he's a talented writer, and he sticks to his morals no matter what. But being the typical Seth Rogen type, he likes talking about dicks, and he likes taking drugs. The humour can get pretty crude at times, but it's redeemed by dragging Charlize Theron in on it as well, giving her an opportunity to prove she has the comedy chops to at least keep up with Rogen, if not surpass him entirely. And I've got to say, there's something endearing about seeing someone so gorgeous and in such a place of authority brought down with sex talk and taking drugs to embarrassing consequences. You can tell she had a lot of fun with this role, and it shows. Nothing makes comedy shine more than the actors having fun with it.The Humour isn't just crude though, there's plenty bouts of slapstick, wordplay, wit, and even some biting political satire. Oh yes I said it, completely unironically Long Shot can often play off as a biting political satire. To be honest it's hard to avoid some degree of political commentary when your movie focuses on a political run for president, and Hollywood has never shied away from taking a more liberal stance. And yet Long Shot comes off as remarkably balanced in its viewpoint. Fred is quickly established as very anti-establishment, writing articles against a two-party system, and how the whole fiasco of politics is pointless. He's a centralist, with fairly obvious liberal leanings. And yet late in the movie we learn that Fred's best friend is a Republican, blowing Fred's mind and making him realise that politics isn't everything. That people with opposing political views can still get on. It also says a lot that Charlotte's party is never explicitly made clear, and honestly could go either way at times. The current president sits a fine line between Trump and Martin Sheen's turn in West Wing, caring more about a movie career than his presidency, and being easily influenced by the Rupert Murdoch type. And the very fact there's a Rupert Murdoch type is used to great effect to explore this political criticism, forever pulling the strings in the background, forcing Charlotte to compromise on her bill, blackmailing her with illegally obtained video footage. And of course his own news flagship is a complete mockery of Fox News with misogynistic news anchors that care more about Charlotte's appearance than her political accomplishments, much to the annoyance of their own female anchor.Honestly, I feel like Long Shot is this year's Game Night. It may lack the surprising technical creativity employed in Game Night, but it makes up for it with relevant themes and an exploration of American politics without losing sight of its comedic or romantic elements. Long Shot, much like Game Night, is far better than it has any right to be. It's a genuinely enjoyable time no matter your taste. Rogen's comedy elevates it above generic RomComs, while the RomCom elements will no doubt ease people into Rogen's comedy. I give Long Shot a surprisingly high 8/10. I hate feelgood movies, but this made me feelgood and I want a sequel.",Long Shot
88,sweidman-28016,Hilarious,7,12 May 2019,"Long Shot Review:Long Shot follows Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogan), a journalist, who meets one of the most influential women and his first crush from middle school, Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron). Charlotte decides to hire Fred as a journalist as she runs for her campaign. The trip they eventually leads them to question if that crush is still there. I didn't see much for this movie except that it got pretty good reviews and I saw the trailer once. I wasn't sure what to expect but what I saw I thought was actually pretty good. It's a comedy and I usually don't like those since it's either a hit or miss with the plot. The plot to me was pretty good. I was invested and thought it was hilarious. That's all thanks to Charlize Theron and Seth Rogan. They both had strong performances and were hilarious. I was more invested with Theron since she doesn't do that many comedies. She plays a serious business woman who is exploring all these new things which was interesting to see as she explored these new things. The story, like I said, was good. It was a nice mix of comedy and seriousness. There were really awkward tone changes. One in particular was supposed to be funny, which I thought was funny, but it was just really off. It also was predictable but I didn't expect more. I would advise that this movie is very crude. I like crude humor and think it's hilarious. Some people in the theater I could tell got a little weirded out by that, which is understandable. Some aren't into that kind of thing. There's nothing really for technical aspects that I thought were noticeable. I liked the songs choices I guess. There was a bad CGI plane but it's not like the budget was put towards that. Nevertheless this still was a pretty good movie and better than I expected. There's not much else I can say except that I liked it. It's one of the better recent comedies. With movies like The Hustle and Poms that just came out and aren't supposed to be that good, I'd recommend seeing Long Shot. It's a fun comedy and a feel good kind of movie.My Grade: A-",Long Shot
89,ethanbresnett,One of the best comedies I've seen in a long while!,8,4 June 2021,"I really think that this film has slipped under the radar a bit and doesn't get nearly enough recognition.Long Shot is a genuinely funny comedy, full of laughs from start to finish. It has a great style, ranging from physical comedy, dirty jokes, through to intelligent humour as well. I can't remember watching another comedy recently that made me laugh as much as this.The love story is also pretty engaging too. Seth and Charlize had great chemistry both romantically and comedically and they worked brilliantly as an on screen duo.In terms of the plot its all very fantastical and far fetched, but so watchable and enjoyable. There's a good selection of supporting characters as well, who flesh out the story and play off the leads well.There really isn't anything to complain about with this film. A fantastic comedy which is sure to make you laugh and give you a good time!",Long Shot

Lots of laughs, some high-brow political humor, and a wonderful flashback scene to a babysitting moment. Also, great use of music! Overall, this teeters on the edge of even being a 4 star film!

""Long Shot"" is wholly predictable in both its conclusion to this question and in how it gets us there. At the end, enjoyment of ""Long Shot"" will ultimately come down to how much you can buy in on the admittedly ridiculous notion that Rogan and Theron would find true love in the arms of each other. Unfortunately, ""Long Shot"" is trying to blend comedy, romance and politics into one, but at just over two hours, the movie is slightly too long. Basically, the movie does have a few laugh-out-loud moments but unfortunately they're few and far between. Also, like most of Rogen's movies it is filled with vulgar, adolescent humor which means there is absolute nothing especially new, interesting or exciting about this film.

95,Magow-Intermean,Long Shot Review,9,21 March 2019,"Charlize Theron plays a presidential hopeful who falls for Seth Rogen's speechwriter in Jonathan Levine's far-fetched comedy. Long Shot hardly begins to describe the premise of Jonathan Levine's latest comedy, in which an unemployed journalist who looks exactly like Seth Rogen woos one of the most powerful women in the world, who looks like just about the most glamorous version of Charlize Theron you've ever seen. Like its female protagonist, whose relationship with pop culture and fun ended when she set out to change the world in high school, the picture is in some ways stuck in the '90s - a time when moviegoers went for insane White House romances like Dave, or that other one where the president seduced an employee and was still championed by feminists. Very funny whatever you think of its more old-fashioned notions, the picture will charm many viewers who can set implausibility aside for a while; it's certainly the most commercial film yet by The Wackness director Levine. Rogen's Fred Flarsky is a fearless muckraker whose career in investigative journalism hits a snag when a media baron (Andy Serkis' Parker Wembley) buys his newspaper. Jobless and sad, he phones up childhood buddy Lance (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) for an epic drown-your-sorrows evening that ends, thanks to Lance's big-shot connections, at a very swanky Manhattan party, the kind of affair where media barons and politicians mingle. Soon, he's causing a scene by telling Wembley how awful his Fox News-ish media empire is for America. And he's catching the eye of Secretary of State Charlotte Field (Theron), who's convinced she knows this horribly dressed loudmouth from someplace. Turns out she does. She used to babysit him. Field is about to run for president, and has been told she'd be the perfect candidate if only she were funnier. To the dismay of her aides (June Diane Raphael and Ravi Patel), she hires quick-witted Fred to write for her; having known (and secretly loved) her at the dawn of her idealism, he has insights that can make her speeches sing. He travels with her on a whirlwind tour as she builds support for an ambitious environmental agenda; they trade ideas in the globe's most romantic capital cities. Knowing her from a more vulnerable time, Fred helps Charlotte shake off some of her perfectionist tendencies. Eventually, she finds herself drawn to him. The point at which one says ""This is ridiculous,"" and what one does about that observation, will vary from person to person: Is it when Fred wreaks havoc at a diplomatic dinner and isn't fired on the spot? When the couple's first kiss is interrupted by a firefight, which forces them to take shelter in a beachfront paradise? Or when Secretary Field engages in life-or-death diplomacy while in the throes of MDMA? Those of us who've witnessed love between penniless schlubs and Type A goddesses at close range may accept the pairing of Theron and Rogen, who make a sweet if not magnetic couple onscreen. But some of this is tough to take. That being said, screenwriters Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah (along with, presumably, some uncredited puncher-uppers) pack this thing full of laughs. No audience will ever be as generous as a festival premiere where a large percentage of the crowd has a financial interest in the film, but at this screening, the response to many zingers threatened to drown out important dialogue that followed. Supporting roles are broadly drawn but successful - from the trio of vapid boors doing an excellent Fox & Friends impersonation (Kurt Braunohler, Claudia O'Doherty and Paul Scheer); to the president (Bob Odenkirk), who should begin each speech with ""I'm not a real president, but I've played one on TV""; to the Canadian prime minister (Alexander Skarsgard), whose dreamy looks mask a total lack of charm. Yves Belanger's glossy photography and Mary Vogt's wardrobe give the film a sheen to match its high-stakes romance. The pic conceives of the challenges facing Secretary Field (and her responses) in ways unlikely to earn Long Shot a place on the Top 10 lists of Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris. But for viewers happy to see the sensibilities of the Apatow era paired with the vintage high-concept, low-plausibility rom-com, this bet pays off.",Long Shot

100,daisukereds,An Adam Sandler's Pixel-like movie?,1,9 August 2019,"As with anything Seth Rogen related, it's a painful start. It's not really easy to swallow. And in the end, it's kind of pointless. You can SMELL the effort they put into humor from the very first scene.. through the screen and it stinks. Even 15 minutes in, they are still trying hard. I also find it ironic that Seth plays a ""writer"", specifically to write ""jokes"". And of course his character is a junky. And even worse, he takes his shirt off.There's nothing really special to this movie. Seth makes it feel like something familiar.. A movie you've already watched already, like ""Pineapple Express (2008)"", or ""The Interview (2014)"". If I didn't know who wrote it and produced it, I would swear this was an ego project, which makes it fascinating! It's kind of embarrassing for everyone (maybe not Andy Serkis). But it is embarrassing for Charlize, which I would understand her doing it once (for ""A 1,000,000 ways to die in the West""), but twice?It's too plastic, and there's no message or emotional connection to these synthetic characters. There are no memorable scenes or events. It's not even a good way to pass the time, or a decent romance movie (they manage to ruin the moments with dumb jokes). It's not even crazy enough.Personally, I would not recommend this ""political comedy"" to anyone. But I'm sure there is a crowd for it.",Long Shot

Nothing fun about that.Then the whole middle of the movie revolves around getting high off ecstasy and Charlize Theron has to resolve a diplomatic crisis when she's high and talks all cool and hip. Theron isn't known for being funny and she did nothing to make me think otherwise. Nobody in the theater was laughing at this scene and I live in Western Washington. There's a good chance half the people in the theater were high.I don't know what Charlize did to her face but she looked fake or seriously ill.

105,gavinp9,Enjoyable rom-com,7,17 April 2019,"'Long Shot' is not a typical Seth Rogen raunchy-comedy, but in saying that, it still features a fair bit of language, sex and drugs. However, not that many classic Rogen laughs! It's not co-written by Rogen or any of his friends, but still relies a lot on his everyman charm as Fred. The film belongs mostly to Charlotte (Theron), who is Secretary of State, but seems mostly normal and nice. Theron and Rogen work quite well together onscreen.Directed by Levine ('50/50' and 'Warm Bodies', both great), he handles ""rom-com"" well, keeping the pacing up and not dwelling on any drama for too long. There's plenty of able comedy support for Rogen, with Maggie (Diane Raphael), Lance (Jackson/Ice Cube Jr), Tom (Patel) and Chambers (Odenkirk) getting some decent jokes/moments. Andy Serkis as Wembley (Rupert Murdoch substitute) is great to watch - and between him and Odenkirk's ignorant President, provides a great bit of up-to-date political commentary.It's all quite believable and both the tender and serious moments are handled well. The whole ""she would never go for him"" thing barely comes into it, as both Theron are relatable and their chemistry is nice to watch. Good ending and feels quicker than it's 2 hours.",Long Shot

An unlikely pairing of Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron in a romantic comedy that somehow works and keeps you entertained. If a film is billed as a comedy it has to be really well written and executed to have me rolling in the aisles and this film certainly didn't do that, however there were more than a few laugh out loud moments. There was also a good if light hearted plot. Theron plays the lifetime crush of Fred Flarsky (Rogan), having once been his baby sitter she is now the Secretary of State of the United States of America and way out of his league.......or is she??? Hired by Theron as one of her speech writers against the well meaning advice of her closest aides, Rogan turns from an uncouth lout into something more special, yet retains much of his loutishness. This film reminds me very much of Dave starring Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver in so much as it marries up two of the most unlikely people, one practically unattainable and one of the so called common people. I seem drawn to comedies that cock a snook at the American political arena, but they make for some entertaining watching and this one certainly fits the bill.

107,movieman6-413-929510,Amusing comedy with two opposites.,6,5 May 2019,"Long Shot is a new romantic comedy directed by Jonathan Levine, the director of 50/50 and Warm Bodies.The film is about the journalist Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen), who was just fired because he tried to share the news with the world in a hard but true way. When he meets his youth, Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) at a party, the two still feel a mutual connection.
Charlotte is one of the most influential women in politics and can stand a chance of becoming the first female president. At the party she saw that Fred is still as charismatic and charming as before, so she decides to hire him as a speech writer.
Fred has to get used to Charlotte's richer lifestyle, but soon finds out that Charlotte still has feelings for him. This way the two secretly start a relationship with each other again, but it is better if this remains secret. In this way the two work together and continue on the romantic path in secret.With this film they play in a comical way with opposites, because Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron their characters are very opposite of each other. In this way, the two provide fun mutual comedy moments in the film. The rest of the comedy can come across as something familiar and as predictable. Furthermore, they make some pop culture and political aspects ridiculous and there is some slanting humor in the film. Despite the fact that the film is also a romantic comedy, the romantic genre cannot be seen much in the film and it is more about the comedy, which two opposites can create together.Seth Rogen does play a kind of character again that he has played in other comedies. This way his comedy moments may seem familiar, but he still manages to put down most of his comedy in his own comic way. Charlize Theron is also very comical, but because she plays more in other genre films, you don't see this often in her acting. It is nice to see her comic sides again. The further cast also does good work in the film, but they also play more stereotypes, which you have seen in other comedies. Andy Serkis also has a cameo in the film, but you can hardly recognize him again. He has also played roles in The Lord of the Rings and The Planet of the Apes films with motion capture in which he cannot be recognized, but in this film he is lucky with simple make-up effects and a wig. This way he shows how well he can act and also knows how to stand out in a film.",Long Shot

Overforced and way too unrealistic (for comedy too) infiltration attempt to some WASP/Nazi group, just to show how good man main male hero is.Then we had still very gorgeous female main hero - well gorgeous until starts talking - then we can hear lot of unnecessary 'F' words, what is especially bad considering her position. So, she decided to run for President of USA .
I don't have problem with female leaders, I raised in country where we had female Prime Minister in 80-es (not UK) .I really feel sorry for afro-american actress, Oscar winner Charlize Theron. Her last movies are really not on level of former ones, in most cases. But real question is who to blame for it ? Maybe it is just that there is no much choice now in mainstream production.
Had no clue about Set Rogen, and I guess why - but will not talk here about all stupid dope humor he made.

109,WalkdenEntertainment,"It's a ""Long Shot"" but here goes...",6,19 April 2019,"Fred (Seth Rogen) is a passionate journalist who also has a witty sense of humour. Fred decides to quit his job and his best friend takes him out to an exclusive event in hopes it will help cheer him up. At this event Fred is reunited with the stunning Charlotte (Charlize Theron) who is currently running to be the next president.Fred and Charlotte really have nothing in common other than that Charlotte used to babysit Fred when he was a little boy. This means he naturally has an embarrassing past with her. Fred is soon hired to work on Charlotte's speeches and the two develop a new close (and yet humorous) romantic relationship.The chemistry between our two leads is fun. Actor Seth Rogen delivers yet again the same type of character we have seen before. You know what I mean- the witty yelling, drug references and crude sense of the humour. But to find Charlize Theron on screen in this type of loose comedy genre was really great to see. Naturally the two actors are stronger when they are both on screen together. Take Seth Rogen away from Charlize Theron and our scenes become less exciting (and vice versa).As a plot, sadly nothing is really new. A boy falls in love with the beautiful girl who seems out of reach. Needless to say, even when I knew what expect from this film going into the cinema, I can't deny that I still found myself having a few laughs. A part of me wishes that this film was a little more different than the normal crude type of humour that Seth Rogan is always well known for or maybe I'm being just too picky. I would love to see something different from him in films one day,Other side characters also manage to do well here and huge credit must go out to the actor Andy Serkis who I didn't even recognise until the 3rd act (well played good sir!).As far as pace, the start feels snappy and moves along with the right feel, but this all slows right down when our two leads are not in the same room. I will also state the film's 3rd act and final climax goes on way too long and seriously deserved some attention in the editing room floor.Overall, I feel most Seth Rogan fans will know what to expect here: crude and yet witty humour, this time shared with a stunning Academy Award winning actress, Charlize Theron. The two have great chemistry but the film suffers whenever they are away from each other. The film's pacing, particularly the 3rd and final act, drags on far too long. Otherwise, as a film there isn't much here that is new for viewers.6.1/10

I found it very unrealistic, even though it's a comedy movie, it should still have a little bit or realism. The way she just let some crazy and unprofessional journalist, who she barely knows get involved with her political work was so not realistic, and just a weak attempt by the writers to get them to be involved with each other.

111,srdjan_veljkovic,Too little substance,4,17 August 2019,"It's too long and has but a few good/interesting jokes. Sure, there are good ""light comedies"", but, such movies need to have something else working for them, which this movie lacks completely.Charlize Theron look good for her age, but is way past her prime, which is kind of OK for the character that she plays here, but, that's kind of the problem. This character obviously looked great in her prime and it is very unlikely she was into politics. There are much, much better prospects for such a woman. If she played a former model/actress/whatever turned politician after her prime, that would make sense, but, no, she's a character that is a career politician. For a light comedy, this is way too unrealistic for a leading role.There are other strange choices, like Seth Rogen suffering two very bad falls at the beginning of the movie and moving away largely uninjured, yet this is not further explored (this ""superpower"" of his). Again, way too unrealistic for a light comedy.The romance is not done well. Sure, we get why Seth Rogen falls for Charlize (he had a crush on her as a boy, and meets with her again as a mature, beautiful woman), but, the other way around, we just don't feel it. Mostly because Theron does not do her job well in this regard. She goes from ""this is good, if weird guy"" to ""come to my bed at once"" in like two seconds. But, also, the story is lacking substance there, even though it's like more than an hour that her falling in love unfolds.Which brings us to the pivotal problem. This is 2 hours long. Way, way too long for what it offers. If it were reduced to something like 80 minutes, it might have actually worked (if it kept all the jokes).The feminist ending is also too much. He takes her last name and finds that his life's mission is to just support her, yet he is a good, if unconventional, journalist, who risked his life for a story?

Hell, I'd vote for her.",8,1 August 2019,"Politics is a game of appearances and navigating mass appeal, of course, and it's doubly hard for a woman, no matter how beautiful, how solid her policy positions; early focus groups score Charlotte in the 90th percentile, but ""if you were a man, you'd be in the '190s,"" Lisa Kudrow's press manager admits. The key to ensuring her electability? To bring her 'humor' factor up a few points, to make her seem more relatable to the American public. After all, a woman can't just be smart and capable - she has to be one of the guys, as well. On top of that, she has to be fodder for romantic gossip, whether with Fred or the gormless Justin Trudeau-like James Steward (Alexander Skarsgård), with his toothy grin and inoffensive good looks.Much the same can be said of Theron, an actress who can seemingly do no wrong, offering crackerjack chemistry with Rogen while standing out in her own standalone comic scenes. Rogen's the funnyman of the equation, but even his wisecracks can't hold a candle to a late-film scene where Charlotte has to suddenly negotiate the return of a captured American soldier while rolling Molly hard. Whether she's kicking ass in full-on action pictures, winning Oscars in prestige dramas, or cracking wise with the best of them in comedies like this, Theron is a movie star of indefatigable range. Hell, I'd vote for her.All of this only scratches the surface of Long Shot's unconventional charms and doesn't even mention the beautiful, scene-stealing presence of O'Shea Jackson Jr. (an actor I've loved since Ingrid Goes West) as Fred's laidback, successful best friend. But that's the appeal of something as warm, easygoing, and unexpectedly political as Long Shot: if you want to see it for the Seth Rogen jokes, have at it. But fully engage with it, and you'll find a lovely romantic comedy about two people struggling to make a relationship work when the fate of the free world (and public opinion) is at stake.",Long Shot

Hope I am right. (That would be a first)This was not funny at all, maybe a few muffled chuckles In an almost could have been funny kind of way, but they went by so fast we hardly noticed.This had too many F-bombs by everyone and was just as annoying as Seth Rogan was who practically yelled his lines the whole time. Wonder if he thinks he is funny doing that?Production wise all was good. It's the script, language and raunchiness of it all that wasn't good.To cut to the chase: the big to do here has to do with Charlotte and Fred getting it on and there is a video of Fred satisfying himself sexually and well.........um ........both he and she hope it doesn't go viral, of course. The dilemma for Charlotte is that she may have to make a big political concession for it not to go viralAgain, this was not funny although Ms Theron did a very good job most of the time. There was simply too much language. See where we are going, folks? Not good.I now need to go back to my earlier oath of not watching these comedies regardless of who may be in them. Very Disappointing. (So................I was right and you weren't) Sadly,......... yes. (2/10)Violence: Not really, but a bomb did go off on one of Charlotte's trips

It's written by hacks who have cobbled together an unlikely story as the key premise of any romantic comedy, and then utterly failed to deliver.On the basis of this film, the genre is toast as no one should ever wish to see anything as bad as this.The miscasting of the leads compounds the errors and the other casting choices are no better either, with limp lines and only a shrill caricature to portray, they are as engaging as TV for the under 5 year olds.The story, such as it is, is basic virtue signalling which fails to capitalize on its targets or to make any witty commentary. Hardly surprising given how stupid the entire script is.The romance is even worse, if that could be possible, with the oafishness, clumsiness and erotic intelligence of a prepubescent boy's furtive imaginings.It's hardly surprising it failed commercially and all those involved should take up waiting tables.",Long Shot

128,AdrenalinDragon,I gave this movie a shot and enjoyed it,7,6 May 2019,"Long Shot had been getting pretty good reviews for a Comedy and I liked some of Seth Rogen's previous stuff, so I decided to give this one a shot. I got what I was kind of expecting. Some raunchy jokes and pop-culture references, but there's also some nice topical and political humour in there too. If a good portion of the jokes are funny that's what counts most, right? It basically plays out like most Rom-Coms with a guy having a chance encounter with a crush he had in the past and winning her over throughout the rest of the movie.To give credit where credit is due though, I do think Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron work very well together in this movie. I never felt that it was unbelievable that these two could develop fondness and feelings for each other. I also think that alot of the comedic timing and the personalities of them both help keep the movie engaging. As for the jokes, they don't all land but the decent ones did give me quite a good laugh. It's a fairly lengthy movie for a Comedy, but I didn't feel the pacing was too bad and yeah it's predictable but in terms of gags and being entertained this one delivered for me. The movie is also fairly nicely shot in parts and has good use of music, and the acting is fine.Overall I came out enjoying Long Shot for what it was. It's a Rom-Com sure, but I feel it's one of the few that has more effort put into it than the usual ones. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but if you're looking for a movie with a decent amount of laughs in it and some entertaining character stuff, it's at least a good try. If Seth Rogen gets on your nerves though or you don't like crude humour, then it probably won't be your cup of tea.7/10",Long Shot

135,mirwais-orbit,Fresh,7,22 November 2019,"Yeah, this is a different romcom from those ones we are used to watch.We get that most romcoms have something strange and abusive for the moment Seth Rogen's character asks if Charlize's wants him to be her Marilyn Monroe.That question is crucial to understand a lot, mainly how women are truly positioned as the ones that always have to accept the worst offers and the worst consolation prizes to achieve happiness, romantic or professional objectives. Not only that, women are usually portrayed in movies (specially romcoms) as the ones that always have to be open for men's decision, never the contrary. And thankfully, Charlize's character doesn't fall on that trap easily.And we must watch the movie from that perspective too, so we can understand for how many decades women have been told what to do.Charlotte is not Fred's wardrobe ornament, that one he can pick up and use whenever he wants. And even if screenplay wants to reverse some classic romcoms rules, Fred isn't treated like that as well, making it clear that feminism doesn't mean that men need to face the same issues that women face everyday, instead, means that decisions in life fits well for both sides.nThe dialogs are funny, and the chemistry between Theron and Rogen is the highlight. I like both. I'm a huge fan of Theron's work. And even though I like Rogen's free will and improv skills, I think that he should just turn his volume down a little bit sometimes. He's always yelling, always overacting and overreacting on camera. There are scenes between he and Theron that I asked myself why he was yelling so much or overusing physical comedy, shaking and raising his arms everywhere, when there was only the two of them in the scene. Moments that made his character pretty annoying instead of charismatic.""Oh, that's his comedian style"". Give me a break about that. He acts like a clown most of the times because it's the easiest way for him, a secure zone that we know he can step out, doing things differently and at the same time still funny. Watch Take This Waltz and you'll what I mean.There are some sequences that really messed with this new romcom experience, although does not impact negatively in a whole. Like the moment they are attacked and the pre-credit scene (that one between the end and the final credits). The pre-credit scene can be funny, but does not fit in the movie as a whole because Fred is acting stupidly and Charlotte's condescension over his behavior doesn't fit to the character at all.Anyway, a pretty decent and funny romcom, full of honest moments delivered by a great cast (main and supporting). A breath of fresh air in a genre that always have something more to tell, but industry's always afraid to explore and break some traditions that doesn't fit anymore in our reality.",Long Shot
136,gcsman,"From the reviews, I thought this would be better than it was.",4,19 May 2019,"Long Shot is solidly in the rom-com/opposites-attract category. It's got good people in it (particularly Charlize Theron, about whom - wow) but what put it down for me was the *extreme* choice for what ""opposites"" means. She's a hyperachieving Secretary of State who jets around the world and is on a first-name basis with all the international leaders who might matter, and who has ambitions for higher office. The current President (Bob Odenkirk) is an airhead who'd rather leave politics to star in movies -- a nice reversal that's good for quite a few jokes in the script. Then, he (Seth Rogen) is a scuzzy independent journalist, dresses like a homeless dweeb, has a kind of foul mouth, and has no surface civility. They meet at a function, sort of recognize each other, eventually realize they grew up next door to each other. She hires him as a writer and it goes from there following a pretty predictable path.It's just too much of a fantasy. Having met him for all of half an hour, all of sudden he's part of her inner circle team. He doesn't do much professional or personal adjusting to her or his new lucky situation, until practically the end credits. There are some laughs but overall I couldn't suspend enough disbelief to make this work.I don't think you'll miss anything if you give this a pass, except maybe for Theron's terrific wardrobe. That spectacular red dress she wears when we first meet her (along with what's in it, of course) is something to behold.",Long Shot
137,snowfre,A fun movie that has a hard time staying interesting,6,9 December 2019,"""Long Shot"" is a movie in which the raunchy journalist Fred Flarsky (Rogen) teams up with his former babysitter now Secretary of State Charlotte Field (Theron) as her speech writer. The film is a romantic comedy with political undertones, however, these never overtakes the plot to much or lectures its audience in ""good"" and ""bad"" opinions. With just the right amount of Rogen's stoner-type comedy, the film balances the romantic theme with the humor quite well. The reason I cannot give ""Long Shot"" a higher score is due to its trouble remaining interesting and relevant from start to finish. Many scenes just feel unnecessary to the overall storyline, while they might be funny, why would they include the kidnapping drama - in lack of better words - when it didn't really fill any purpose? And this is the main flaw of ""Long Shot"", there are way to many irrelevant scenes to give me a positive feeling when the credits start to roll. Is ""Long Shot"" worth a watch? I guess so, there are hilarious parts in the film, especially when the Secretary needs to handle a hostage situation abroad through phone after a long night with alcohol and various other substances. Did it save the film? No, but it was fun. By the way, can you spot Andy Serkis?",Long Shot

I was pleasantly surprised. Let's get the negatives out of the way. The tone of this film is severely inconsistent. There is a scene where Seth Rogen's character and Charlize Theron's character get attacked by a militia group and the scene goes from being serious to funny and to romantic and this happens within 3 minutes. Most of the movie is like this and it starts to get annoying. About 25% of the jokes were not funny at all and were just weird and the film starts to get a little too political in the second half. And now what are the positives of this film. Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron's chemistry with each other is the single best part of this film. Both actors play off each other really well and it's a lot of fun watching them act together. Most of the supporting cast does a fun job. I really liked Andy Serkis as the big media head. 75% of the jokes were actually pretty funny. I wasn't expecting how funny they would be. I won't spoil any of the jokes but the video at the end they show is extremely funny. The cinematography isn't anything special. The plot is understandable and flows nicely from scene to scene. The dialogue is natural and doesn't feel forced. The visuals are fine except for this one helicopter about halfway through the film. Overall, Long Shot provides a funny romance film with great chemistry between the lead actor and actress and extremely funny jokes while lacking a consistent tone. I give Long Shot a 6/10.",Long Shot

The balance between romance and comedy works and leans slightly towards the latter having enough funny jokes to hold the movie. The writing is witty and somewhat original. Not everywhere, but for the majority it feels so. It's not that all jokes land well, but there are enough that do, which kept me entertained through the whole movie. And while non of them made me grab my belly, they were certainly funny. Somehow, the writers also managed to avoid the obvious territories, such as sex and toilet jokes. The cast makes the movie work. Charlize Theron is exceptional. She just gets better and better with every role she plays. Always so delightful to watch her. June Diane Raphael was also a great casting choice. Seth Rogen is certainly not my cup of coffee but he fits the role.

Like you pretty much know going in that you're going to see a relationship between the main actors but that's honestly the only predictable thing about this movie at all.

I was able to suppress my disbelief and finish watching the whole movie. So it is still a watchable movie.

The cast are all great as well, and Theron and Rogen have excellent chemistry, which obviously helps the piece a lot as you fully believe, and are invested in, their romance.

I see what the idea was -- put two different types of actors together, and see how th contrast gels. Problem is, it didn't gel all that well.Several reasons for that. For one, it didn't handle tne non-gag scenes well. It treated them like burdensome fillers to take us into the next gags. As a result, despite dealing with a series of dramatic emotional challenges, it treats them like a ten year old would -- ""oh geez, is the kissing over yet?"" Maybe in that way, the narrative was too ambitious, like ""we want to do complex romantic issues; we want to do political commentary; we want to slam trump; we want to be funny; we want to be heart-warming."" That's a lot to ask for a comedy movie when one of the two co-leads isn't even funny.It probably could have been much better as a limited series on cable. Something about three 75-minute episodes.

156,cappiethadog,Tracy Flick reconsidered,9,7 June 2019,"It's an honor. The president may be a cipher, but he's still president, and Charlotte Field(Charlize Theron) has just been summoned to meet with the leader of the free world in the Oval Office. Being in proximate distance, both spatially and career-wise, to the highest seat of power is what Secretary of State Field always dreamed about, back when she was a starry-eyed young woman, giving earnest speeches as a class president hopeful to her hormonal unformed constituents. ""Making a difference"" didn't involve making compromises in order to make nothing happen as a dam from making something worse. Face to face on West Wing furniture, President Chambers(Bob Oedenkirk), a television actor who played the commander-in-chief on a hit TV series, lets Charlotte know that he won't be seeking reelection. Oedenkirk, playing a benign version of our world leader explains to his underling that he wants to transition into film. We get the joke: Chambers' term as president is a reality television show. He's not an ex-actor. The audience can glimpse that ""Longshot"" had ambitions to be the zeitgeist, but like Charlotte Field's comprehensive global environmental initiative, this political satire is watered down. There are parallels, albeit indirect to the real world. An alt-right group, a white nationalist organization that Fred Flarsky(Seth Rogen), an investigative journalist, infiltrates as a pledge member, exists in a political vacuum. Their agenda is not in accordance with this fictive administration. That's because ""Longshot"" is not a political film; it's a rom com framed by politics. It's non-partisan. President Chambers, we can surmise, is evil, but the evil goes unnamed. Name the evils and Charlotte becomes unlikable by association. Any hint of a hyper-conservative agenda will remind the audience of so many past and present cabinet members; an enabler. So instead of a red and blue divide, the political war waged here is a civil one that's currently being fought within the minority party. Fred, an unabashed liberal, against his better judgment, accepts with caution the job of speechwriter. Charlotte is only left of center, not an ideologue, so there is a bridge, but it's not a bridge too far, he thinks. Being a cog in the political machine gives Fred pause, but he adores Charlotte, his old babysitter and unrequited love. Down deep inside, the far-left leaning politico must grasp the cynicism behind Secretary of State Field's environmental initiative. Her ""seas, trees, and bees"" campaign is just a big, splashy run-up, a dog and pony show for her presidential candidacy announcement. Fred is right. Chambers, who has a cozy relationship with Parker Wembley, a RM-like newspaper mogul, will attempt to undermine her fight for science. And Charlotte's easy acquiescence, as if she knew her bill was fait accompli from the outset, gives her a six-degrees-of-red sheen, caving in as she does to the forces of special interest group on behalf of multi-nationals. Rising sea levels and deforestation are necessary evils of the status quo; she knows this; he knows this. Fred, however, knows that her rhetoric isn't doublespeak, a coded directive to kill the planet. No actress, not even Charlize Theron can give a performance beguilling enough to be a spokesperson for such draconian policies, as say, dismantling the EPA, and still be somebody you could root for. Fred, the longshot, described by Charlotte's staffer as resembling a baked potato in a windbreaker, would turn the tables and make Secretary of State a longshot if she was a ""scorch the earth"" type. Similar to the current sitting president, Charlotte knows that her boss gets ideas from the last person who has his ear. She can brainwash him. When Secretary of State Field walks into the oval office, the candidate that President Chambers will endorse has not, as of yet, been determined. As a political satire, ""Longshot"" lacks a bigger bite, but it's still a bite.On a train, in John Frankenheimer's ""The Manchurian Candidate"", Rosie(Janet Leigh), a communist operative, controls Ben Marco(Frank Sinatra), a former soldier, with this, the first of many non-sequitirs: ""I was one of the original Chinese workingmen who laid down this track,"" whereas Charlotte Field, the 2024 presidential hopeful, simply states: ""I've been vetted,"" to garner her boss' endorsement. Chambers is ""The Manhattan Candidate"". ""If I'm angry, I'm hysterical. If I raise my voice, I'm a *****,"" the secretary of state complains to Fred. The double standard still exists. A current presidential candidate treats her staff poorly, allegedly, according to news reports. The female senator yells, but so does her male counterparts, and yet they don't undergo the same scrutiny for doing what bosses are apt to do; give orders, sometimes loudly, when those orders aren't carried out as prescribed. But times have changed. The double standard is not as pronounced. ""Longshot"" showcases the female politician as a social norm, and more importantly, in a positive light. Charlotte, as a high school senior running for student body president, doesn't need to adopt a masculine persona in order to be taken seriously. Kind, soft-spoken, and nurturing, the future president runs on a platform that involves recycling and feeding the homeless. Charlotte gets to keep her femininity. Alas, her male opponent defeats her, a nod to yesteryear, when people felt more comfortable with a man in charge. But the secretary of state's original idealism, saving the planet from extinction, a liberal talking point, is something that Fred, the first boy to recognize her potential, never forgot. He fell in love with Charlotte's vision, not just her pretty face. But it's the latter that produces Fred's appendage to change shape in the aftermath of a kiss in her kitchen confines. Contrary to what Secretary of State Field says, she is not a ""**** *********"". She couldn't be more different than Tracy Flick, the anti-heroine of Alexander Payne's ""Election"", the 1999 comedic political satire about a teacher who tries to prevent a bad seed from running Carver High's student body government. But is Tracy Flick an anti-heroine, somebody the audience hates or loves to hate? The ""Me Too"" movement forces the viewer to read against the grain, since ""Election"", filmically, is rigged in favor of Jim McAllister(Matthew Broderick), the supposed hero. Tracy Flick, in retrospect, was less of an anti-hero than post-feminist. With the passage of time, the audience can see Broderick's character with clearer eyes, now that Ferris Bueller, his career-making role, is less prominent in the minds of aging Generation X'ers. The pudgy, middle aged social studies teacher who narrates: ""I've seen a lot of ambitious students over the years, but Tracy was a special case,"" has nothing in common with the guy who jumped on a parade float and lip-synched to ""Twist and Shout"". It's easier to see Jim McAllister for what he really is; a misogynist, a creep. At the turn of the century, the political arena still carried the air of being ""a good old boys club"". And Tracy's homeroom teacher can be easily pegged as an institutionalist, the byproduct of a patriarchal mindset. Tracy wants to burn the party down. A pitchfork-carrying audience who shamed a 20th century female intern may not have been prepared for a challenge to the masculine/feminine binary, and was taken aback by Witherspoon's portrayal of a natural born political animal that looked like the head cheerleader or prom queen. Tiny minds. ""Election"", from the outset, establishes Tracy as being more-than-ready to take on the film's extrapolated gatekeepers, men all. Equipped with sign-up sheets, working ball-point pens, a goldfish bowl, and chewing gum wrapped in silver foil, Tracy, the ""early bird"", launches her bid to be student body president. The short montage, with its quick cuts, mimics Tracy's cognitive activity. The candidate isn't at all intimidated about entering a man's world. The table legs are phallic symbols; each leg she unfolds is ramrod straight, wrapped tightly around her fist. In other world, she grabs the bull by the horns. ""Election"" is co-narrated by Tracy Flick and Jim McAllister. Pick Flick.David Novotny(Mark Harelik), a science teacher, gets fired after the principal learns about his ongoing relationship with the then-high school junior. Since Dave is Jim McAllister's best friend, he never considers the possibility that Tracy was the victim of a predator. Jim avenges his buddy's dismissal by hand-picking Paul Metzger(Chris Klein), a down-and-out quarterback sidelined by injury, to run, and hopefully, dash the dreams of a young woman in ignominious defeat. Tracy, whose interior dialogue maintains that her relations with Mr. Novotny was consensual, contradicts the autogenous screaming(unacknowledged trauma) as she watches Paul gather the necessary signatures to run. Is Tracy Flick a fallible narrator? When Jim McAllister declares Paul the winner by nefarious means, does ""Election"" understand that Tracy is being punished for being a woman? Jim blames the young girl for his own lustful thoughts. His moral failings are unaccounted for. ""Longshot"", on the other hand, allows Charlotte to succeed politically, even though a video of Fred in his hotel room goes viral. Fred, undoubtedly, is an underdog, a man who beat the odds, and got a beautiful and accomplished woman to love him. But Charlotte, too, is a longshot and underdog; she becomes the first female president. We bet pm Charlotte; we bet on Charlotte and Fred, because ""Longshot"" loves longshots.Conversely, ""Election"" bets against Tracy. She's portrayed as the femme fatale who ruins the career of a teacher. Eric(David Wenzel), a lackey, who we see helping Tracy with her campaign, was cut heavily from the film, according to Alexander Payne. Eric was a longshot, too; he lovedTracy Flick. She was not just a piece of meat drooled over by two sad middle-aged men.Tracy was loved.",Long Shot

His journalism career would be completely opposed to her party and politics. There's no way they would connect. But the romance was the most unrealistic. It was telescoped way in advance, but she must have been out of her mind, because he gives her no good reason to like him.This was just another fantasy exploration of the possibility of a female president - and not a realistic or good one. She would never be elected given what she wanted to do and who she was with.

159,garethvk,A Winning Romantic Comedy,8,2 May 2019,"When a media conglomerate purchases the Newspaper he works for; edgy yet determined journalist Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) quits rather than compromise his integrity.Around the same time Secretary of State Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron), has learned that her boss will not seek re-election and will be endorsing her to be the first female President of the United States.Charlotte is about to undertake a long trip around the world which will include stops in several key countries and she hopes to use this extended trip as an opportunity to build support for her environmental plan which in turn will be a platform for when she is able to announce her run for the White House.
A chance encounter at a party brings Fred to her attention and she learns that the awkward but kind individual is actually her old neighbor whom she used to babysit when they were in school.When Fred decides to loudly take issue with the new owner of his former employer at a swanky event; Charlotte reads his work and realizes that Fred may be ideal for helping with her speeches during the long trip ahead.
Despite his reservations about politicians; Fred has limited work choices and agrees to take the job much to the dismay of Charlotte's team who sees him as a shabby lout who will not fit in with the Socialites they will encounter on their trip.
As the trip unfolds Charlotte and Fred become friends which in turn leads to more which further complicates the situation as Fred does not appear to be the type of person that her staff can see being paraded in public when she announces her run for office.What follows is a funny and touching tale of the complicated world of romance and friendship in the public eye as well as how politics can make people change their perspectives and beliefs in order to keep the status quo.
The two leads work well with one another and have a real chemistry and the strong supporting cast is a winner. ""Long Shot"" is a real pleasant treat and is the best Romantic Comedy of the year to date. The jokes are frequent and mix well with the romantic elements which makes the film a winner.4 stars out of 5",Long Shot

161,margulanabutrlov,Long Shot Review,10,21 March 2019,"Charlize Theron plays a presidential hopeful who falls for Seth Rogen's speechwriter in Jonathan Levine's far-fetched comedy.
Long Shot hardly begins to describe the premise of Jonathan Levine's latest comedy, in which an unemployed journalist who looks exactly like Seth Rogen woos one of the most powerful women in the world, who looks like just about the most glamorous version of Charlize Theron you've ever seen. Like its female protagonist, whose relationship with pop culture and fun ended when she set out to change the world in high school, the picture is in some ways stuck in the '90s - a time when moviegoers went for insane White House romances like Dave, or that other one where the president seduced an employee and was still championed by feminists. Very funny whatever you think of its more old-fashioned notions, the picture will charm many viewers who can set implausibility aside for a while; it's certainly the most commercial film yet by The Wackness director Levine.
Rogen's Fred Flarsky is a fearless muckraker whose career in investigative journalism hits a snag when a media baron (Andy Serkis' Parker Wembley) buys his newspaper. Jobless and sad, he phones up childhood buddy Lance (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) for an epic drown-your-sorrows evening that ends, thanks to Lance's big-shot connections, at a very swanky Manhattan party, the kind of affair where media barons and politicians mingle. Soon, he's causing a scene by telling Wembley how awful his Fox News-ish media empire is for America. And he's catching the eye of Secretary of State Charlotte Field (Theron), who's convinced she knows this horribly dressed loudmouth from someplace.
Turns out she does. She used to babysit him.
Field is about to run for president, and has been told she'd be the perfect candidate if only she were funnier. To the dismay of her aides (June Diane Raphael and Ravi Patel), she hires quick-witted Fred to write for her; having known (and secretly loved) her at the dawn of her idealism, he has insights that can make her speeches sing. He travels with her on a whirlwind tour as she builds support for an ambitious environmental agenda; they trade ideas in the globe's most romantic capital cities. Knowing her from a more vulnerable time, Fred helps Charlotte shake off some of her perfectionist tendencies. Eventually, she finds herself drawn to him.
The point at which one says ""This is ridiculous,"" and what one does about that observation, will vary from person to person: Is it when Fred wreaks havoc at a diplomatic dinner and isn't fired on the spot? When the couple's first kiss is interrupted by a firefight, which forces them to take shelter in a beachfront paradise? Or when Secretary Field engages in life-or-death diplomacy while in the throes of MDMA? Those of us who've witnessed love between penniless schlubs and Type A goddesses at close range may accept the pairing of Theron and Rogen, who make a sweet if not magnetic couple onscreen. But some of this is tough to take.
That being said, screenwriters Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah (along with, presumably, some uncredited puncher-uppers) pack this thing full of laughs. No audience will ever be as generous as a festival premiere where a large percentage of the crowd has a financial interest in the film, but at this screening, the response to many zingers threatened to drown out important dialogue that followed. Supporting roles are broadly drawn but successful - from the trio of vapid boors doing an excellent Fox & Friends impersonation (Kurt Braunohler, Claudia O'Doherty and Paul Scheer); to the president (Bob Odenkirk), who should begin each speech with ""I'm not a real president, but I've played one on TV""; to the Canadian prime minister (Alexander Skarsgard), whose dreamy looks mask a total lack of charm.
Yves Belanger's glossy photography and Mary Vogt's wardrobe give the film a sheen to match its high-stakes romance. The pic conceives of the challenges facing Secretary Field (and her responses) in ways unlikely to earn Long Shot a place on the Top 10 lists of Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris. But for viewers happy to see the sensibilities of the Apatow era paired with the vintage high-concept, low-plausibility rom-com, this bet pays off.",Long Shot

The way the story is structured is good, keeps things interesting, the protagonists are attacked from various fronts, from Margarett disliking Seth's character, to te evil Wembley allying with the president. This creates interestihg conflict. I felt the last 20% of the movie going too slow, from the part where Seth and Charlize break up. I also feel Seth's arc missed a few beats. I didn't get his character was one who won't listen to other's opinions because, in fact, every time he sticks for his opinions and won't listen to others, he's actually right. So I felt him more of an idealist than a non-listener. I also feel the scene when the couple argues in Sweden was too easily solved with the aurora borealis.

Lower IQ's you will never find and no sentence is uttered without F, F, F. This is the goal.

I might even go as far as saying hilarious at times. I honestly can say that I laughed from the opening scene to the credits. The writers and actors executed the lines very well.Speaking of actors, the cast did a very good job. The surprise delight character... O'shea Jackson Jr. He was the perfect compliment friend and character in this movie. Otherwise, Charlize Theron was quite captivating in her role. I found myself falling in love with her, respecting her and laughing at her character. Surprisingly, I think Charlize's success in the movie is due to her great chemistry with Seth Rogen. Seth displayed some sincere acting ability throughout the movie. Yes, he was doing his normal crass stoner humor, but also displayed some solid range that I didn't think I wanted to see in romantic comedy. This is a step up from his previous movie ""Knocked Up"".Long story short, this movie is actually very funny and will have you laughing throughout.

190,SteveMierzejewski,Long Shot Misfires,5,1 August 2019,"There are two main reason why this romantic comedy fails. First of all, it has no romance and, second of all, it has no comedy. Oddly, it starts out as if it may be an interesting movie, but, if after 15 minutes you're not really captivated, and I mean really captivated, turn it off and go do something far more interesting, like cleaning your gutters.Are there a few laughs. Yes, mostly at the beginning. The movie tries to make us believe that this relationship would actually work in real life. However, you would have to suspend all your concepts of reality to believe this. In other words, it is a situation in which you simply can't accept the romantic component. and the actors don't seem to have the chemistry to make us think otherwise.Seth Rogan plays Seth Rogan, or basically the same character he plays in every film; the sloppy 13-year-old trapped in a dysfunctional adult body. I have no idea why Charlize Theron agreed to act in this. Maybe times are rough.The film loses all credibility as it evolves and it evolves primarily into a film for the same 13-year-old boys that Rogan attains to. It is relentlessly predictable.It baffles me that this film is rated as high as it is. I can only guess there are a lot of Charlize Theron fans who are looking to see how she does in a comic role. Let's just say she survives it. But, in the end, this is a film that will be quickly forgotten, and that's good.",Long Shot

When really, the fact that she is able to be strong enough to stand by her values and her emotions is exactly what makes her career worth saving!Perhaps my values do lean left, but it's not about politics. It's about personal integrity, and growth. And the willingness to look at things from the other side!So many people seem to imply that her actions are illogical. They EXPECT their politicians to be a bunch of blackmailing/blackmailed fools, and the mere fictional depiction of an honest politician with integrity offends them to their very cores, enough to give a movie a rating of 1 or 2 lolHow badly does a movie have to offend you to get under 4?... If a movie is under 4, I haven't watched it to the end. People claiming 1-2 who HAVE watched it to the end are not rating the movie but the ideology or whatever which offends them and goes against their personal beliefs... I would suggest you behind-hurt individuals revise your rating and push it up a good few points. Being able to offend you that much, enough to get you on here lmao that has to be worth a few star points right there!!!Really, great job Seth and Charlize, and all the writers and everyone else involved.Seth, to be honest, it's not quite as funny as I would have hoped and enjoy from you, a bit too serious and ""political"" :-p but then RomComs are not my thing really.

Seth Rogan is the usual dweeb as unbelievable leading man, I still don't know how he gets cast, he plays the same bumbling guy every time and isn't funny. It's the old game of trying to normalize things through visual media ""you can't be what you can't see"", which is why you saw so many black and women presidents in fiction over the last decade, but this film is broken as the theory.At no point does the Charlize character justify her run for the presidency, we're just told she's qualified, just a cartoonish hostage negotiation, and at the end we have a canned ""moment of sincerity"" as if that was all that mattered. A 40+ year old basket case of a character, unmarried, too late for children, but some how, she's qualified to run the country.Beauty only goes so far, and only lasts so long, so many of these woke actresses are examples of what happens once it's all laid bare by age. Some women exude genuine grace and charm, others like Theron are at best boring, at worst simply unbearable to watch now. Her private life is more interesting than this film, the dysfunction is real, and its why hollywood has such trouble creating stories anyone can relate to now, they no longer understand what is important, and have become disconnected from reality.I believe the very strange glowing reviews on here are from former hillary voters who needed to indulge in some kind of wish fulfillment fantasy, because for anyone else this is horribly boring.",Long Shot

199,lumieretrain,Long Shot by Jonathan Levine,7,21 February 2021,"Stories about two main characters who haven not seen each other, for a very long time, are some of the most intriguing ones to tell in the literature, movies and television series. These stories get interesting to see, how the two main characters would be romantically connected with each other; even if each of them have followed two different careers. Since they have started to have a special bond with each other, they move forward with happiness, by wishing it would never end. Until they have to take a difficult decision, which is going to affect both of them. Some of these stories would end, with the main characters who decide to stay together, by keeping to accomplish wonders. While other stories would end with the main characters who split with each other, to move forward with their own career separately; even they would try to be still, in contact with each other, as friends. The filmmaker Jonathan Levine seems interested to explore this theme, by adding some realistic elements, to create a movie which balances the humor and the drama. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out Long Shot by Jonathan Levine with Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron. The movie's plot: The free spirited journalist Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) reunites with his childhood crush, Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) who is one of the most influential women of the world, as she tries to run for presidency. Charlotte hires Fred as her speechwriter, which they would lately have a romantic relationship with each other. The movie mixes the drama and the humor, to give the touch of the realism needed for the story; especially to see how the main characters would together, help each other and experience some of the most magical moments which unite them. The production designer Kalina Ivanov has created the sets, which emotionally connects with some of the most important moments of the movie; especially in the way the spaces describe, how much the main characters are close with each other, including with the use of the colors for the movie sets. The cinematographer Yves Bélanger has captured some of the most essential moments of the movie, through the lenses of the camera, helped by the lightings and the shadows, to see how the atmospheres of the story would be developed; especially in the way, some of the most fundamental moments of the movie, would surprise the audience in every camera movements and in every angle shots. The editors Melissa Bretherton and Evan Henke, have created a rhythm in the story's narration, to balance the drama and the humor. As it does not rush the rhythm, but it has been elaborated to give, the right time to make the audience laugh; as well as to let the audience witness, some of the most serious moments of the story. The score by Marco Beltrami and Miles Hankins, have been elaborated to melodically describe the feelings of the main characters; in the same way, when the notes changes from the funniest moments to the serious ones of the movie. Seth Rogen did an excellent performance as Fred Flarsky, a free spirited journalist who commits important steps for his job, to get often times in troubles; since he reunites with Charlotte, he would discover some of the most magical things, he has never tried before, to witness a special spark in his eyes. Charlize Theron did a really good performance as Charlotte Field, a sophisticated smart politician who would lately has a special bond with Fred; since she has been in a relationship with Fred, she would face some issues to be a bit heavy, even she never allow that something would try to divide her and Fred. Long Shot is one of the most surprising comedies, which mixes the humor and the drama, to be balanced without rushing the rhythm.",Long Shot

Charlize is the funniest I've ever seen her as a surprisingly down to earth Secretary of State. Seth Rogan is the most charming I've ever seen him. They really use these actors strengths that probably don't get featured too often in their other films. The movie starts off a bit slow but once the two characters come together it really shines! It doesn't take the same roads as most romantic comedies do and will surprise you. I hope you all enjoy this movie. I highly recommend.,Long Shot

It's all right there and it is not skin deep; it's beautiful.Not forgetting the evolution of the half-finished swastika tattoo.

It has a storyline that is far from being typical and it is told through a really well made script that is full of great dialogues and an enormous heart, managing to make me laugh hard for several minutes and to be warmed by the cuteness of this perfectly unconventional love story.Rogen and Theron did an excellent job too. I loved the way they both looked together and how they embraced the characters they played. I also realized that I prefer Charlize in his comedy roles rather than in the serious ones (don't misunderstand me, I know she has made terrific performances in films like 'Monster' and 'Tully', I just like her comical side a little more).10/10.

All acting is superb, chemistry between Rogen and Theron is through the roof. The funniest character in the entire film is the president, which is loosely and purposely based on the current U.S.president. There is a scene that's a sweet nod to a now classic Pretty woman, with Rogen being Julia Roberts and Theron being Richard Gere. Another nod to the same film is a song by sweddish duo Roxette 'It must have been love', which is very much present throughout the movie.

236,deandsouza15892,Really well scripted political comedy,8,5 May 2019,"Well, this was a pleasant summer surprise - Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron starring in a political romantic comedy. What could go wrong? Not much, to be honest. First off,the writing is amazing; it's infused with a meta-commentary on the politics in 2019, along with a lot of heartfelt . You're shown a pretty rare perspective of a high-ranking member of the government, who actually wants to do some good, paired with an obnoxiously passionate journalist, who doesn't compromise on his moral code.The dialogue is what keeps you in, switching seamlessly from incredibly funny to downright realism. It expands on how to accept people with beliefs that don't match your own, and how compromises can sometimes be the right way out. The very few negative elements of this film are the runtime (which could've been cut down by 30 minutes) and the occasional sloppy editing.Overall, we're still in the Endgame,but if you're looking smart comedy, this isn't much of a long shot.",Long Shot

It's a comedy !
And a good one by my standards. Ok, not like the "" Bird Cage "" or the like, but a good , clean entertainment , with almost all crew pulling their weight , and surprise , Charlize was really funny . Seth Rogen we know, it's good as usual, but that blonde girl, can make me laugh , and that's tell me that she is a beautiful , hard working , talented actress .
The plot somehow predictable , a reverse of Mr. Prez like movies, still had to offer enough good fun for a at least a Oscar nomination providing no other ( still welcome ) comedies will come up until December. Hard to believe , given what i have seen since the start of the year .
So, i give only 8 stars , but in my view it's a lot for a comedy, which is really hard to make , therefore this one deserve all the credits.
Petty there is no 8 and 1/2 stars to be given .
Now , i'll take my wife to see it , and me to see it again. Yeah !",Long Shot

This is quite a slick movie despite its tendency to go a little 'frat boy' more than once. But this is Theron's movie for me. I caught myself thinking, why can't we have leaders like her Secretary of State, Charlotte Fields? Granted, she doesn't have to contend with something as awful as our border problem, or as nauseating as John Bolton, but she does have to handle some other thorny obstacles so it isn't entirely a soft ball send up.

The story is a lot like ""Notting Hill"" and works really well through good acting, with Charlize Theron being way over-qualified for a role like this but I think she really lifts the movie and gives credibility to her role.My recommendation is to see the film for what it is: A not too serious romantic comedy where there's a good laugh around every corner.",Long Shot

This film definitely hit my funny bone and the fact that Seth and Charlise wouldn't be a normal 'fit' made it even funnier IMHO. I see so many negative reviews here I I simply don't get the hate for this film. I thought it was quirky, off the wall and comedic which is not what I expected at all. I laughed out loud and hopefully you do too. We all have our own 'tastes' when it comes to films but I truly am surprised at the lack of higher ratings.

274,tub51461,Typical 21st Century Comedy But Had Plenty Of Great Moments,7,23 June 2019,"If you want to watch Long Shot, you can't take yourself or at least Seth Rogen as a drama actor seriously. He is a comedian and he loves to make a fool out of himself in his roles. That's just how he connects to the world. Makes him a type-cast actor. Without a doubt, this film brought film put in some dumb things with this character who finds it necessary to use drugs on occasion and cursing in his writing. Is it necessary? No. The main character Fred isn't perfect when it comes to class, but all of us would connect with his average Joe look and quirky non-pretentious personality.Charlize Theron is the total opposite. Her character is exactly what you would see when you look at Charlize Theron. Beautiful, glamorous, intelligent, etc. The character has a successful hard working politician who rarely sleeps and is often burned out from her career, trying to make a name for herself in politics. In the end though, the character isn't perfect either.I can't remember other movies where Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen star in the same movie, but they certainly carried this film to make it worth 2 hours of viewing. Is the film made for everyone? No. I would have done without two scenes and dropped several f-bombs and then it would have been an 8 or 9. I enjoyed it regardless.",Long Shot

280,Jodro2,"Funny in places, not credible enough in others, amoral portrayal of drug-use",5,29 February 2020,"On the positive side, some of this movie was quite funny, and the movie also tried to communicate quite a large number of positive values: portraying women and strong and independent, care for the environment, addressing global warming, the idea of a woman for president, honesty and integrity in politics, and even the idea that Republicans and Democrats can get along. So far, so good.However, there were some things that greatly lowered the credibility of the movie, and a couple of scenes that were downright offensive and need a lot of explanation when watching this with 15+ teenage kids.First of all, Rogen's characters is badly drawn in the beginning. The movie starts with him as a journalist spy in an extreme right neo-nazi group, something that takes a considerably amount of courage, organization, and social skills. He's also told, in the next scene, that he's a great writer. The fact that Rogen then in the next scene goes from a savvy, brave, intelligent albeit abrasive journalist to a completely clueless, socially inept loser with no self-esteem who acts and looks like a down-and-out is hugely problematic.Even less credible is that fact that the glamorous Secretary of State of the US, Charlize Theron, then falls for someone who is portrayed as a clueless loser. This undermines the main premise of the entire movie. Theron actually acts very well, but is completely miscast. The entire movie would have worked better if the actress was not so drop-dead gorgeous but more 'normal' looking.Having a model-type woman cast as Secretary of State (following on from Madeleine Albright, really?) also reinforces the Hollywood stereotype that the leading actress has to be young and beautiful, and can not be a regular-looking woman. This rather undermines the very feminist the values the movie tries to propagate.Finally, with regards to our teenagers. There's a sex scene in which Theron out of the blue asks Rogen to slap and ""slightly choke her."" What?!?! I don't have a problem with teenage boys watching sex scenes, but this totally gives the wrong impression. People who are into SM are in a small minority, yet this gives the impression that it's normal for women to want to be spanked and choked. It was also not particularly credible for Theron's character. Presumably the scene is played for laughs, but it took a bit of talking and educating our teenagers after the movie.And finally, there's an extended part of the movie in which Rogen and Theron go out to score drugs and then get high on them, and this is all portrayed as funny and without any negative consequences. Heck, Theron even manages to sort out an international political crisis while high on drugs. Aside from being totally non-credible and out of character, these scenes took some discussion after the movie. This part of the movie so had its heart in the wrong place that it really put me off.",Long Shot

300,shanekolacz,Pedestrian Effort at Best,4,19 July 2019,"Apologies to all those reviewers who thought this was 'fresh' or 'new', but to me at least, this movie was 2 dimensional and at no time was I convinced that the 2 main characters were in love or indeed had any chemistry at all! So, as a romantic comedy it fails. Still, plenty of inappropriate pair ups have worked when the material was zany enough (Something About Mary, for example), unfortunately the material isn't zany enough here either despite Seth Rogen's presence. Even the opening sequence isn't carried with enough conviction to make it funny. The main stumbling block seems to be the insistence of the writers to make some pretty obvious PC points. The interview scene just before the end credits is cringeworthy. The sexist comments by the Morning Show hosts is just unrealistic unless the film was set in the 80's (it isn't). And the Theron's character's platform of saving the world with the subtext that only a woman would try this daring scheme, but selfish men (a thinly disguised swipe at Rupert Murdoch) would force her to compromise her principles IF she wanted to be president, is just handled childishly. To sum up, Rogen and Theron are not Rock Hudson and Doris Day and the writers of this shlock are not the Farrelly Brothers.",Long Shot

310,austincoleman-66971,Cliche but sophisticated at the same time,8,4 May 2019,"As far as RomCom tropes go, Long Shot probably won't surprise anybody. It is very formulaic and predictable.And yet, this did not detract from the fun of this experience at all. I had such a good time. The film is completely aware of the culture it is set in and successfully exploits that. The jokes land basically all of the time.It isn't just good for the laughs though. Theron and Rogan have excellent chemistry that cultivates depth in this relationship. One of the things Long Shot does best is it gets us to empathize with BOTH of them and the difficult challenges they each face uniquely.Given the nature of the characters, it would have been so easy to turn this into a vain political statement in disguise. Yet this was not so. In fact it did such a great job balancing those aspects...reminding us at the end of the day that our political and social reputation is not what is most true about us...that any conversation it might spark is the RIGHT kind of conversation.Apart from the cliches, the only other quibble I can think of is that it feels a bit too long, especially toward the end. But it was so much fun otherwise that that is about as minor a minor complaint can get. Jonathan Levine did a great job directing this. Even Rogan's humor, which is notoriously over the top, is not TOO over the top here. Obviously it still won't be for everyone, but I would still absolutely recommend seeing Long Shot. There is room for it to potentially become more, but if nothing else it will be an enjoyable time full of laughs. In my eyes it is one of the better films to be released so far this year.",Long Shot

Nevertheless I can't recommend it as entertainment simply because as film, it is very bad indeed. The story is completely superficial, everything is unreal. The story is based on facts that in no way could've happen, after all it is announced as a romantic comedy, not science ficton or fantasy. You could say that it is a political comedy..........that doesn't understand or better said doesn't want to understand how the political forces of America or the world work, which makes the whole film completely absurd and therefore not worth watching at all. Appart from that, there are some sex scenes between Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen which must be the worst ever in film history, it's embarrasing to watch, you can see that there exists zero motivation between the characters and of course no natural attraction. Everything in this film is artificial and that's the problem everything is forced and unnatural.

Seth Rogen, whose acting range is easily surpassed by a plank of wood, plays the same character as always and, yet again, we see his golden trio of ""humour"" - vulgar, sexual and drug - this time somehow integrated into a film about the first female run for presidency. The characters are either boring or making nonsensical choices, the world which they inhabit is mind-numbingly simplistic, and the only parts that are even conceivably funny are based on stereotypes (haha, so original) or slapstick humour.

It reminds me of ""The American President"" but with role reversal which is a nice change of pace. I don't think anything I say will change another's mind they will either really like it or not but I will say this:1. The soundtrack is AWESOME, which we all know can make or break a movie and2. The very last ending scene where Flarsky and Fields stare at each other and say:Fields: He is my Mr.Flarsky: I am her Mr. and she is my President.Then they look at each other and that it looks real like they are in love and awe!

345,JerryLambert,High Guy Fantasy,7,24 May 2019,"We have seen plenty of maid turned princess movies for teenage girls. This movie is sort of like that, only this one is for 40 year old unkempt stoner dudes.Charlize Theron is arguably the most attractive forty-something female on the planet. In this story she is also the Secretary of State making a bid at POTUS. Bob 'Saul Goodman' Odenkirk plays the current President. I was thoroughly confused about his background. Was he a TV star turned president who wants to be in movies? Either way, his character was incredibly unbalanced, but that doesn't matter. This whole story is unbalanced and weird.An unemployed journalist in his late 30's to early 40's, played by Seth Rogen, runs into the Secretary of State at a party featuring Boyz 2 Men as the entertainment and we find out that his old babysitter is none other than the Secretary of State. We learn that an embarrassing encounter involving a tent pole when the journalist was a kid was the last time they had seen each other.So, yadda yadda yadda, they fall in love and the fact that she is a successful and beautiful woman and he is an unemployed and let's face it, not terribly attractive, man child with political anger and substance abuse issues makes the campaign a little rocky. There is also blackmail involving a specific type of liquid and a beard.Without giving away spoilers, which is probably impossible, I will say that I laughed out loud several times. The story is ludicrous, and not just because Seth and Charlize fall in love, I guess that could possibly happen, but the comedy is top notch.One of the things that I appreciated about the story was that it examined how short sighted and one sided Americans have become when it comes to politics. Like love, politics are not supposed to be simple. It also pointed out that relationships between friends, family and loved ones are more important than ones own personal political beliefs.I give this one a 7 because it is really funny. As dumb and unorganized as the story is, it still manages to be sweet and funny and hilariously raunchy. I think this would have made for a better TV series. Bottom line, don't take it seriously and you will enjoy this movie.",Long Shot

352,christianolivarez-78828,Cum Face,8,30 May 2019,"Okay guys we're talking about the movie Long Shot starring Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron. There's a few notable characters but I won't bore you with those. Look it up on IMDb. So Seth Rogan plays Fred Flarsky who is an off the wall journalist who quits his job due to moral reasons. He's also super prideful and it's his way or the wrong way. Charlize Theron plays Charlotte Field who's the Secretary of State and is a presidential candidate. Charlotte use to baby sit Fred when they were younger and Fred has a crush on her. They cross paths at an event where Fred needs a job and Charlotte needs a writer to improve her speeches. All caught up? Cool.So the beginning is totally In your face. It's a white power neo nazi party where Fred is trying to get the inside scoop. If you've seen the movie Sausage Party then you'd get kind of nervous. Cursing and in your face comedy is cool but too much is just too much. You know? Luckily things tone down a bit and some good scripting comes to play. There's good supporting actors introduced and Rogans character flaw is introduced from the beginning. Hello good character arc. I liked how there was a good in-depth explanation how they met and how crazy it is that they are in the same room. I will mention O'Shea Jackson Jr. is Fred's best friend and is actually hilarious. The film wouldn't be the same without him and Seth Rogan's friendship.Anyway, the movie builds well. Charlotte hires Fred but gets some resistance from her team because, remember, Fred isn't exactly politic material and can be a liability due to previous articles. Now what I appreciated is the way the relationship between Fred and Charlotte is slow and steady. It's not forced at all and you get why she would even like someone like him. I do gotta say that they're on screen chemistry is really good as well. We're talking Mr. GQ you know. Now let's not forget Fred's flaw that he's super prideful. The way Charlotte has to run things (and i say has to because she's looking to be the first woman president so she's gotta please a lot of people) doesn't jive with Fred because she needs to make sacrifices that he simply doesn't understand at this point of the movie.So on, things go on well and the relationship blossoms to a great under the table situation. Now in a story like this you gotta know that the ""we can't be together"" thing is coming. And it does in a very good way. Charlize plays this role extremely well and shows a lot of depth with her dramatic and also comedic acting. It's not forced. You empathize with her quite a bit because she has so much responsibility but doesn't let that stray her away from falling in love with Fred and being okay with people know that. While Fred over here is all in his head and becomes kind of a jerk. Not on purpose though, keep in mind. It's just he hasn't overcome his flaw. In comes O'Shea. The light from the dark clouds finally turns Fred's mindset around in a way that's hilarious and also relieving.On goes to the end of the movie which I'll let for you to see because this is definitely worth watching. The originality of the movie, character development, and acting is a big win. The only criticism i would have would be with some of the commentary that happens, the length of the movie and also that beginning. If you like Rogan or even remotely liked Zack And Miri then you'll really enjoy this one. I'm giving this movie a solid 8/10.",Long Shot

I almost wanted to pause the movie so I could fully laugh at a joke before the next one was fired off. I'm not going to give anything away, but just know there was a sex scene that had me cackling. Of course there were a few parts that were unrealistic or unnecessary (pro tip: masturbation scenes are literally never necessary) but that made the film even more light-hearted.

This is a well above average romcom, even if you have to suspend belief a little that two people separated by such a big gap in privilege and status can end up together. It rarely happens in real life, but the romantics among us like to believe that true love ultimately triumphs over all. There are some genuinely smile worthy moments and a few hard hitting truths about issues that I'm sure all those who aspire to high political office will have to grapple with some time during their lives. Do you sacrifice your integrity, the beliefs you hold dear on the alter of ambition in order to get elected, especially when powerful outside forces are working against you, or do you hold firm and risk not getting elected? I'm happy to say, it's all resolved beautifully in the end. Idealistic perhaps, unashamedly so, but you leave the cinema with a smile on your face. I won't give the ending away but it's a nice result. I was a bit surprised at the R rating, sure there is some candid sexual dialogue, but no nudity or simulated sex or the like, a PG rating would have been more appropriate in my opinion.

And I am not a big Seth Rogen-fan, prior to this one, since he often is a bit over the top, but here he was toned down to a perfect level.

The dialogue is very well done, the two leads feel very human. Obviously, some side characters are accentuated, but it's all intentional and succeeds in the writers' and actors' attempts for comedy. The accentuation also highlight the parts of society and media that are quite ridiculous, further adding to the comedy.The chemistry between Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen feels honest! It could just be me, but I really bought it. This might be the most charismatic Rogen has ever been, while still bringing that classic goofy Rogen vibe.All in all, Long Shot is a great way to escape for a little bit and sort of see what one wishes the world was more like.",Long Shot

The chemistry between Rogen and theron were great together - the relationship is believable.For a romantic comedy they really did a pretty decent job of the background story, while not also spending so much time dwelling into the details - it painted a perfect background of what we needed to know to understand the story between the two.It has quite a few funny scenes and the overall movie was enjoyable.It's not the greatest movie in the world, but does a decent job at being a simple good hollywoodesq comedy while also going into the deeper meaning of the film's entire message.The deeper message from this aside from all the racial, sex dark humour jokes is the message of love and sacrifice and the willingness to change for the better.it really incorperated the message well through the film, and ultimately is why it might have made the film that much better.It might not be for everyone, but it is certainly worth the watch.Loved O'shea Jackson as the funny character here, he might even be better than his father in the comedy genre.

You may get disappointed when you get to realize that you can see these guys only in couple of scenes & then they're gone.The story is about a guy called Fred (Seth Rogen) stumbling across his teenage-hood crush Charlotte (Charlize Theron) who is a secretary of state. They fall in love as the story goes on, you know how these kinds of movies are.Charlotte wants to become the president of United States & she has a team to help her.

I know that most politicians are just muppets, but at least they try to keep some apparency. The people who wrote and produced this mess had no clue of what they were doing or what they wanted to achieve. It's vulgarity after vulgarity without any story to tell, the jokes were stupid, as were the characters who had no charisma or chemistry, the music was misplaced, the writing was childish.The second explanation is that this kind of mindless ""entertainment"" ( and lately most of entertainment is resembles this atrocity of a movie) is deliberately fabricated and released into the world with the purpose of destroying whatever beauty the human soul still bears.

There really are no lows that Hollywood, dominated by the regressive left, is willing to stop at. Half the movie was propaganda dedicated to demonizing and muddying up Donald Trump, Fox News, and right-wing Americans.
Aside from the pathetic attempt to portray some sort of balance, by throwing in the ""coming out"" of a black man as a GOP supporter and some token statement about seeing both sides, the entire movie tries so little to hide its ill-intent and clear-as-day agenda.

It's not that the pairing was a long shot, it's that this is the secstate popping X and preventing war high af. Did a teenager write this?

(This is somewhat helped by the fact that in this movie, Seth Rogan's character is clearly a talented writer which, at least, gives him some redeeming qualities).The second wish fulfillment fantasy is that a good honest politician can succeed in politics if their heart is in the right place. Much is made of the fact that Theron's character has to carefully control her image and compromise to succeed as a woman in the world of politics.But in the end, any insight into this double standard is cast aside when Theron's character does the right thing, with potentially politically ruinous consequences, and is rewarded for her goodness with the presidency. The movie spreads the message that all you need to succeed is to do the right thing and you will be magically rewarded with success. It's a message that , in our current political climate, I find a bit naive, and prevents this movie, despite some good jokes from being better than it is.",Long Shot

Small case in point: no career-driven U.S. Secretary of State with presidential ambitions would go out undisguised at night, ingest lots of drugs, party, then immediately go and negotiate a high-level hostage release - high out of her mind - in front of a room full of colleagues. All this with no one recognizing her or stopping her. It wasn't funny, it was just stupid. There were bits here and there that had potential but it all added up to a mess of a movie.

Almost everything happens with the characters being vocal about it, all room for imagination was lost pretty early in the viewing process.

ANDY SERKIS, because, man, I didn't recognize him throughout the whole movie!! When I saw the ending credits I read his name and had to come to IMDB to check who the hell he played and man... he is one of the world's best actors! Congratulations Mr. Serkis!And oh, the movie is good. Always entertaining seeing Mr. Rogen. And Charlize. Oh, man. My mother's friends on Facebook keep saying my mother is beautiful in practically ALL OF HER PHOTOS. That's my mom we're talking about and hey, I know her, I kinda look like her, and we are not BEAUUUUTIFUL people. We have our looks, but I can't call us beautiful.

431,PizzaBizza,"Interesting, even good",7,1 July 2019,"A good movie that I don't regret watching. I like Seths movies and his approach to romantic comedies. The two leads do a good job in filling their roles, the humor was on point, but yeah, the title is true: It is a very long shot that these two fall for each other. The viewer has to let go of realism more than often and just accept, that the two are in love for whatever reason. Once you stop thinking about this the film is fun.
It has the typical story line of Intro, love scene, catastrophy and reunion, but that's ok.Seth's character can get a bit annoying and exxagerated in times, but I guess that's just part of the comedy part.The movie strongly reminded me of ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"". Seths characters are very identical, tongue-in-mouth and using a lot of f-words, he falls for and eventually gets a girl way above his own weight-class and even wording and flow of the dialoge seems similar, but it's still very enjoyable. Compare the final ""we are married now"" scenes for example.Seth is a good actor for Rom-Coms, but I hope he will not make the same identical movie over and over again. He should venture out into other genres, that would be great.",Long Shot
432,asukuslog,Pleasantly Surprised,10,4 December 2020,"Let me just state categorically that I am NOT one of Seth Rogen's fans. In fact his brand of comedy often leaves a bitter slap stick taste in the mouth. They are usually filled with cursive words and are just overly raunchy at times for no good reason. But this film surprisingly worked! Lots of kudos must go to Charlize Theron. She is indeed a great actress with a ton of range; from her Oscar winning portrayal of serial killer Aileen in Monster to playing female action badasses such as Furiosa in Mad Max Fury Road, and now a RomCom. Seth Rogen was naturally 'Seth Rogen' but he surprised me with his occasional moments of weakness. It was a blend I didn't think would work but for some reason or the other worked to perfection; a strong woman devoid of emotional attachments and a goofball man who never took his life or future seriously. It shouldn't work, but it does. That's just how love works sometimes and no formula can explain it. Oh! And the comedic periods were also spot on. I strongly suggest you watch this movie. Don't be too critical just watch and let your heart fall in love with the characters as they goofball their way into each others hearts.

There's enough imagination and subtlety in much of this script to bring out some of the best both leads have to offer.One or two laugh out loud moments, some genuine pathos - and Rogen is supported by one of the most enjoyable sidekicks I;ve encountered in recent times.My only strong critiicism was an uneven tone as the film takes a turn toward a very conventional 'rom com' happy ending (youll get that pun later) - when it settled back into 2nd gear and cruised to the finish line.Theron is formidable - Rogen gives the impression of real whit - and there's enough intellectual chemistry that it would have carried the conceit if not for some rather confected setup sequences.Though the visually fixated won;t get past the aesthetic difference - but then that's almost the entire point.If they;d managed to keep it tonally more original....and left Theron's character with a more spineful way - i think they'd have stuck the landing.But at least it has a semi-brain... unlike crazy rich asiansWhoops - looks like i did it again.",Long Shot

O'Shea Jackson Jr. was hilarious. I can definitely see him growing into a very talented actor. I love how Seth makes light of certain moments like a cheesy rom-com, gives you a bit of cheesy action and of course slap stick comedy, resulting in a viral video of Seth Rogan eating the floor (figuratively). It's absolutely hilarious how Seth Rogen showcases the ridiculousness that has become our democracy as well as breaking the stereotypes of political party association with his ultra funny and spiritually positive best friend.

Seth Rogan is his usual self with brilliant comedic timing, perfect delivery and absurd charm. Charlize Theron was fantastic as the overworked, incredibly talented and ambitions presidential hopeful. Both characters were portrayed perfectly. But the magic is when they get together on the screen. The chemistry is electric, and every interaction is brilliant and true to life.This isn't a highbrow political romcom. It's off the walls, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and every little nod and quip from the supporting cast is executed perfectly.Enjoy it for what it is. Absolutely one of the best romantic comedies and comedies in general I've seen in a long time. All of the actors were excellent, and the writing was sharp and hilarious. Expect some Seth Rogan shenanigans and some wonderful chemistry between these two leads. Theron seemed to really be in her element in this. She is genuine and believable, and Seth really works well next to her to open her up and bring out her fun side.If you can't enjoy this film, you're taking life way too seriously.",Long Shot

It is the typical Seth Rogen picture, with gratuitous sex and drug jokes, but while it might have worked for him a decade or more ago, it is simply old and dull now. We expect it and his delivery is not as spontaneous and charming as it used to be. Add the fact that the plot follows the same formula as every Hallmark movie under the sun and there is little left to appreciate other than Charlize's performance which, albeit good, seems to be a chore for her. However, even her acting talent is not enough to convince an audience that a classic and classy beauty such as herself would ever allow herself to be within one hundred feet of a talentless, repulsive oaf like Rogen.

And it all goes down to the effective team-up of Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron who were just evidently game on portraying their characters down to the last minute. Given with a lot to do in the material, they sell their chemistry very well and both have genuine acting and comedic talents to pull it off.

530,davidhopkinssecond,"Too long, drawn out",4,16 January 2021,"It's a big movie, that really runs around in circles of plot for a half hour longer than it has to. Seth Rogen also falls into his regular tropes of gross out comedy which I find is only getting more tired out and cliche in his work. God, one scene I will never under from that, it was deeply unnecessary. Theron plays an excellent role as always but is underutilized for her talent here and written into a tight space she can't move from. Other guest appearances work, but dear god, I can't watch Rogen again after this.The idea for the movie is alright, and then general plot line is far too drawn out. It's simple enough, and could work though the beginning starts out way too fast and falls into a lull around the middle. Awkward sexual themes, gross acts, and weirdly stated and inconsequential drug use are depicted throughout which I just find weird - not that I'm prudish on that, but there is a bit of over glorification here and it just doesn't work.Other highlights are present, a few good laughs with Bob Odenkirk's character and a good idea for a movie. The problem ends up being that the movie suffers from being long, confusing, and at times non-sensical, with the standard Seth Rogen character in a place where it really isn't needed. I wish it could have turned out better with the other talent in mind, and the overall idea of the film, but it really falls short. Not the worst, but not at all that good.",Long Shot

Charlize Theron is luminous and , in my opinion, they had undeniable chemistry. They really look like they enjoyed one another. June Diane Raphael is perfect in the ""Eve Arden"" role.

I could guess every move it was making 30 minutes before it happened. Even one star is too generous for this pile of trash.

The best way to describe this movie is, imagine watching someone EXTREMELY high on weed. So high they're to the point where they don't really know what's going on, almost makes you feel a little uncomfortable being around them and then they try to tell a joke to lighten the mood, but the joke is either untimely or way out of place and it's not funny, even feels a little awkward.

Lots of oddball humor interspersed with an actual commentary on today's US politics with a genuine interest in the development of an actual love story.

It's always hard for a script writer and director of this type of film to come up with an ending that is up there with Notting Hill. So don't be disappointed if you don't tear up.

It made me smile and laugh a lot, the chemistry is surprisingly good, and it's enjoyable.Longer review: It's not exactly believable - certain things are said and done that would not yield the same results in the real political world - however, it's warm, funny, and the romance part was just really nice. Some people might gag at the sound of that, but you can't please everyone. It reminded me of one of my favourite films of all time; The American President. Not quite the same quality but a similar feel, although with more swearing and crude humour (which I found very funny). There's also a nice cameo/small role by a very well-known actor but the makeup/prosthetics (possibly?) are very good and it took me a few seconds to realise who it was!",Long Shot

I'm not sure if this line of dialogue is present in the final cut of the movie, but it is an accurate summary of it. Seth Rogen & Charlize Theron seem like an unlikely pair, so it's fun to watch their characters mesh with each other in the first half of the movie.

553,dayspring-297-896587,"Fun, Humorous, Mocking our Times, Eerily Autobiographical",10,13 May 2019,"Rom-coms are not my favorite genre, but this was a very enjoyable one. Is it a bit raunchy in places? Yes, but what would you expect from Seth Rogan? Does the topic of sex come up with some of its more explicit vocabulary. Yes...welcome to life. There are always that small minority of people who would rather live life in denial such things are a part of daily living and conversation, so those low reviews from them are not surprising.Since Charlize Theron was one of the producers, I wonder if this was meant to intentionally mirror some of her own personal struggles? To a small degree, it almost has an autobiographical or confessional feel. No she is not running for president or dating someone like Seth Rogan.However, in interviews she has given, she admits she does not subscribe to the values or lifestyles of many of the Hollywood elite, and lives a life quite different from many of them. The politics and dating in this movie become metaphors for her own struggle to maintain her values as she has ascended into the ranks of those very elites in Hollywood from whom she tries to differ. I'm not sure if that was intentional, but the parallels to her own personal journey through the power and elitism of Hollywood are rather eerie and obvious. This thread running through the movie will be lost on those who are not familiar with Ms. Theron's interviews, but those who follow her commentary will likely recognize it.Does the movie mock our current political environment? As others have pointed out, yes. It pointedly reveals the current dilemma within the Democratic party and mocks it openly. It also has obvious digs at both Trump and Fox News. From my position as an Independent, the mocking of both parties in this movie is justified and handled fairly. It reasserts why members of both parties have lost faith in their leadership.If you like movies that humorously point out the social and political absurdities of current society, you'll like this movie.",Long Shot

Um, I mean Charlize Theron is one of the loveliest, and nicest women on the planet, to me -- on-film; and she has been that way since ""The Devil's Advocate"", ""Mighty Joe Young"", and my favorite until now, ""Aeon Flux"". To have a chance at knowing her, and to make it all believable makes for an incredible film. The chemistry between the two main characters is palpable.
Issues? Yes. There was a short scene where the Guy was shocked that his Black best friend was a Republican; but perhaps we could all use a little more ""Republican"" in this great Country!
The plot is believable, and I think everyone so wanted their mutual feelings toward each other to manifest, and not be loused up by money-grubbing Big Shots. See the film to find out if it was.",Long Shot

It was a amazing experience for me , if any other actors were there , i wouldn't have even bothered to watch it , but i love both of em . Even Ice Cube son's there and man is he funny , his transformation from Straight Outta Compton to this amazing best friend who loves his friend more than anything .

I loved every second of it . Even with all the laughs and romance the film has a very simple yet compelling point ""Be honest and never let your dreams be dreams "" which makes this film almost feel like October Sky .
Its a movie for the little girl who dream of changing the world , its a movie for boy who is afraid of taking to the girl they like .
All in all its a cute movie , just keep an open mind when you watch this cause some might feel like they are getting undermined but all of this has a point .

Script is awful, acting not great, formulaic and somewhat insulting due to the ridiculous predictability.

I've never left a ""comedy"" movie feeling sad until 2 days ago. Charlize was very good as usual but he character didn't seem to be designed as a comedic character so you're left with Rogen as the ""comedian"" who plays his usual over-the-top shtick which unlike Will Ferrell, wasn't really an endearing character to begin with.

I like Seth Rogan but don't watch many of his films. Likewise, I haven't seen really any of Charlize Theron's flicks.
It's a cool movie because it allows a make believe behind the scenes view at what must be an incredibly difficult life - national executive politics.
As accomplished as Charlotte is, she's lonely. Fred fills an emotional, love, humor, and intellectual gap in her life.

Sure, the hostage negotiation scene would most likely bomb in the real world but that's why this is a movie, it can claim a fair share of fantasy. And the movie also rightfully projects that just like behind every strong man is a devoted woman, the vice versa truly holds as well. The key for strong female leaders to emerge is support from their male peers, not tokenism and quotas, this movie captures that message in a light-hearted romantic way, good social message.

I was expecting a comedy but it did not deliver. The jokes were for the most part unfunny and sometimes just too stupid bordering on offensive. The chemistry between the leads was better than expected considering but neither has enough star power to overcome the boring predictable script.The film is trying hard to be current and I guess feminist and dare I say ""woke"" but at the same time the male side kick and best friend of the Rogen character is almost a leap back for actors of color; he's playing up such stereotypes and his lines are said with such unoriginality that I rolled my eyes every time he was on screen.Who thought two hours plus was a good idea for this film. Really an exercise in narcissism from someone thinking we deserve to sit through that. Seth rogen is really the most unlikely male lead and his voice is often like nails on a blackboard.The film is really a throw back to the rubbish romantic comedies of the early 2000s.

623,mandygrrl424,"Theron, Rogen's ""Long Shot"" Provides Comedic Short Cut to Some Surprising Political Commentary",8,19 March 2019,"My first R-rated movie starred Seth Rogen.Growing up in a fairly conservative and religious focused family, my first R-rated film (in the theater, mind you-I was blessed to already have had my fair share of home release viewings in the basements of friend's houses or in secret, thanks to my Blockbuster employment connection) was the Rogen and Heigl raunch-fest-with-a-heart Knocked Up.Knocked Up, if you recall, stars Rogen, an overweight, expired frat boy who has no interest in growing up, and Katherine Heigl, a model-esque, large-and-in-charge-with-no-time-for-a-social-life television producer, as the parents-to-be of a surprise pregnancy after an incredibly drunken one night stand. Critics raved about Rogen and Hiegel's performances, solidifying Rogen as bonafied movie star and launching Heigl's career.Fast forward ten years and some change later, and once again I found myself in a theater, anticipating yet another Rogan vehicle where the plot seemed somewhat recycled: a beautiful blonde (this time played by the always excellent and committed Charlize Theron) and an average Joe (a slightly more mature, Rogen, complete with his trademarked genuineness) somehow get involved romantically, in a tale mixed with a generous helping of penis jokes, heavy drug use, and the exuberant use of the F-word sprinkled around like confetti.I went in thinking it would be mediocre.A few hours (and lots of laughter) later, I'm happy to report this one pleasantly surprised me.Theron plays Charlotte Field, the current Secretary of State making the strategic moves necessary to announce her bid for the 2020 presidency. Rogen portrays vulgar-yet-honest alternative journalist Fred Flarsky. Field faces an up hill battle in the presidential race for literally being a woman (something audiences know a thing or two about since the 2016 election), and her team wants her to come off relatable and likeable. Fred, recently laid off due to a large media corporation buy out of his independent online newspaper, thanks to the devious workings of an old, privileged white male tycoon (the never-recognizable but never mistakable Andy Serkis), needs a job.When a chance meeting at an elite party has the pair cross paths, it only takes a few a minutes for the two to connect and make the realization that they went to high school together. Fred had a crush on Charlotte, who had big, beautiful ideas about making the school a better place when she ran for student body president. Charlotte remembers him as the smart, sweet kid who lived next door.Days later, after scrolling through his past articles, Charlotte goes against the cautioned judgment of her campaign team and hires Fred as her speech writer, and immediately the two, along with the rest of her team, embark on a round-the-world tour, touting Charlotte's ""Save the Bees, Trees, and Seas"" initiative, a flowery sounding vision that's to be the anchor of her campaign (and something adult Charlotte still believes in).From there on, it's easy to see where this story is headed. Charlotte and Fred grow closer, as he interviews her to get a better handle on her voice for the speeches he crafts. They butt heads, they disagree. He calls her out for compromising on her beliefs when a country negotiates changes to the initiative, she tells him he is out of line and to remember that at the end of the day, she is his boss and that sometimes you have to play the game to win the game.To anyone questioning if Theron and Rogen have chemistry, the answer is a solid yes. It looks like it shouldn't work, both due to their differing acting resumes and their physical attributes. But Theron and Rogen take their unique blend of class and crass, humor and heart, and it honest to God works.Sparks fly, feelings happen, and before you know it, this film treads into familiar territory, a gender-reversed Pretty Woman that happens to involve politics (complete with the beloved pop standards one would expect from the aforementioned film and typical rom com fare).But then the movie goes deeper than that, and while it appears to be a lighthearted popcorn flick with an edge, there's a lot of subtle (and not so subtle) messages bubbling below and on the surface. The unfair treatment of women by the media, the shallow game politics has become, the necessity of standing by one's beliefs while recognizing when we need to set differences aside to actually accomplish things, and an encouragement to men to support the women in their lives, even if she is more successful than them.
Especially when she is more successful than her them.It was these thoughts that had me pondered as I drove home, ""could movies like this be the answer? Could unassuming, middle grade romantic comedies be the catalyst for starting conversations in the real world?"" Too often, certain audiences are turned off by movies that come off as more lecture than entertainment. But what if a movie, disguised as a comedy, provides honest political commentary in an easy to digest manner that helps audiences reach across the aisle with their perspectives? Could a movie featuring a solid boner joke, a viral video with an unfortunate masturbation mishap, and a highly respected political figure high on molly negotiating a hostage situation like a straight up boss be the one that finally stops people in their tracks, makes them scratch their heads, and state ""I never thought about it that way before?""Honestly, probably not.But given the choice between yet another film with a blatant message that feels like a lecture that won't be heard by the audience necessary, or Long Shot, which tackles political differences in an entertaining and delightful manner, I'd go with the latter.By a long shot.",Long Shot

The witty and even sometimes scary realistic nature of the writing in this film gave me chills. Yes, the stoner guy who was incredibly intelligent, honest, and wasn't afraid to stand for what he believes in...Guess what? Makes the SECRETARY OF STATE who possesses the same qualities fall for him. It isn't about oh look at the nerdy guy get the pretty girl. NO?!!! This is simply a man and woman who find one another and fill in the gaps in their own lives. I thought it executed the political climate in our country beautifully and fairly. One of the most ground breaking scenes I have ever seen in a hollywood film. All in all if you're super liberal or super conservative, you'll hate it and won't be able to take it for the true love story that it is.

The director and writers did a fantastic job capturing the challenges of a romance with a political official that is female and is currently running for president in a country and time where being a woman is challenged on every level. This movie demonstrates that a woman can simply be without altering their persona (i.e., hiding their emotions, acting 'masculine'), obtain their goals through hard work and determination, and find love in the most obscure places and circumstances with a man that not everyone would deem 'adequate' to her standing. In addition, this movie demonstrates that nothing bad happens to a man if they are willing to support the woman they love, show pride in their work, ethic and determination, and respect their decisions and values.

I guess if you make it past the opening neo-nazi scene and think this is funny, then you're good. If you don't laugh at that well then the next 60 minutes does not get any better. It was hard to get past the shameless attempt to give Hillary a 'make-over' with this loving portrayal of her as someone relatable - kind of like Dave (1993) and Bill Clinton. I even when with hopes after seeing the trailers.I have a feeling the present 71% audience score will not stay this high.

641,stanleyaaron,One of the best movies of the year,9,11 August 2019,"I get why there are some 1 star reviews for this, it certainly leans left politically. Seth Rogen's character is a pretty far left journalist who gets swept up into the political games of a major democrat player, Secretary of State Charlotte Field. She is trying to get a major worldwide environment deal done and has her sights on the White House. The movie does make a point that Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen) isn't able to see things from opposing points of view like reasonable Republican values. At face value I get why Republicans in this hostile political environment would hate this movie, but I don't think it's that simple. The message that we should work together is what both sides should all be getting behind. We will just divide further and nothing will ever get done if that happens. Just my 2 cents.
Politics aside, this film was the biggest surprise of the year at the theater. I loved it. Charlize Theron is amazing in it. Seth Rogen does his usual thing, which I usually enjoy. It has some great side characters in June Diane Raphael (from How Did This Get Made podcast), Bob Odenkirk, Andy Serkis, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. The movie was very funny and had a really engaging love story. If you've seen some of Charlize Theron's interviews about how men are too intimidated to ask her out in real life (she says it really sucks) then you can actually believe that her character could conceivably fall for the passionate journalist Fred Flarsky.I highly recommend this film. 9/10",Long Shot

645,gibsonm-50627,"Started off as one thing, turned into another...",5,25 April 2019,"I rated this movie a 5 because it had some laugh-out-loud moments. I like Seth Rogen, even though some of the comedy in his movies can be over-the-top. But this movie started out as a realistic, yet still amusing, commentary on how women in politics have to be twice as smart and work twice as hard as their male counterparts to get ahead. Theron is the Secretary of State working in a White House full of morons (a real stretch, I know.) Rogen is a liberal journalist whose employer was just purchased by a media conglomerate whose only interest is in furthering their own agenda. Theron wants to make a run at the presidency by brokering a global environmental initiative. All very topical and believable, yes?This realism starts to splinter a bit as these two childhood friends reconnect and start working together (he as her speech writer) and then become something more. I did appreciate the first sex scene in all its realistic, disappointing glory, but from there on out, it's one rom com trope after another. When a hugely embarrassing video of Rogen's character emerges and Theron has to choose between love and her career - well, she doesn't. And it still all works out fine for her in the end, because, well...movie magic.I wouldn't have minded this movie so much had it not purported to be one thing and then turned into another. It was a cliche' rom com masquerading as social commentary. It raised my expectations then smashed them to smithereens. Would have really enjoyed it minus the last 15-30 minutes.",Long Shot
646,popcornanddice,Genuinely Surprised,8,5 May 2019,"Having a RomCom that works is very hard to find. Long Shot, starring Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron, nails it. Fred Flarsky working as a undercover journalist for a very damming newspaper loses his job and finds himself at a party with his babysitter crush, Charlotte Field.

651,shop-38144,Many unanswered questions,5,6 May 2019,"This was a charming romp, with perhaps 3-4 solid laughs and some chuckles sprinkled throughout. But my goodness, almost from the first scene the questions started piling up. I'm going to list them here and maybe someone else who's seen it could help with the answers:
1) How did the white supremacists learn Fred's full name so quickly during their meeting?
2) How on earth did Fred manage to survive without a scratch his fall from a 2 story window after directly hitting his head on the car below?
3) Similarly, how did he walk away completely unscathed from the epic staircase tumble at that party? I feel that one of the most pressing matters in this film is Fred's immunity to falls and general harm to his body. It appears that he's unbreakable!
4) What exactly did Fred's best friend do for a living? There was a corner office, and he seemed to have authority over the company. Was he the president, CEO? Of what kind of company exactly? What kind of ambiguous boss job did this guy have? I'm genuinely curious.
5) In the parallel reality that is this film, the president of the country is also an inept moron, yet oddly lovable. Is this a version of Trump? Is this a benign Trump? In this alternate reality presidency, did white supremacy also escalate? That's what the opening scene seems to imply. These questions are very pressing, and I don't have the answers.
6) What exactly was Charlize's environmental reform proposition about that she was trying to get 100 countries on board with? There were some vague references to trees, seas and bees. What exactly was she trying to change in the world? I need answers!
7) The Secretary of State was threatened with blackmail by the president and a media mogul. Isn't that illegal? Like, couldn't they have gone to prison for that?
8) How did Seth and his BFF go their entire extremely close friendship with Seth not knowing that his BFF was a Republican AND Christian?
9) How did Charlize get into Fred's apartment at the end? Did she have a key? Did she break in? How long was she sitting there on the sofa before he walked in?There are more questions. But these are the most pressing ones. Like I said, anyone who have seen the film please feel free to chime in with the answers!",Long Shot

And it's definitely not the romance of the century. But i will tell you what it IS: an ode to the simpler time in film. It's a rom-com. A no-brainer. No need for a twist at every turn. No call for (excuse the irony) a political stance on the latest economical issues. It's just a dumb-minded, fun rom-com reminiscent of a time when it was exactly this kind of film that rushed us to the cinemas. So what if it was predictable. It was happy. So what if it was vulgar; it was unconventional. So quite frankly, I loved it. It was a love letter to the many 90s-early 2000 films that we LOVED. Maybe it won't be the most memorable movie going experience for you, but it is something brave enough to pay its respects to the films we loved in the past.

A middle aged doughy, fuzzy, pratfalling goofball who still dresses like he's in middle school, yet is also SO passionately leftwing and anti-masculine. He only likes music by black people or women and goes undercover to expose the ever menacing ""White Nationalist group"" which is festering in every town. His ""power-to-the people"" news group gets absorbed by the ""Fox"" news stand-in, (who ONLY employ the most vulgar sexist white men you can imagine) so Seth looses it...and his job. But no prob! He immediately reunites with his old fantasy girl from age 13, who now has become (Hillary Clinton), Secretary of State... yet who, in Seth's eyes, looks like Charlise Theron, really DOES dodge bullets at times, AND is still single! Right! Now let's have a good helping of the current President who is, Of course, not only stupid, shallow and egomaniacle to a absurd degree, he's also an jerk and would destroy the environment without a second thought. Gee...how nice to go to a movie that DOESN'T have a strong political anti-Trump HORN going off in the background. There were a couple of odd jokes that DID make me laugh, but the overall anti-conservative soup the whole thing is drenched in just killed the fun for me.

750,eppycalhoun,"Charlize Theron as 'Madam Secretary' if she is younger, single, and falls for a nerd.",7,12 November 2019,"'Long Shot' is an entertaining movie regarding a Fred Flarsky, a left-wing nerdy journalist (Seth Rogen) reunited with his one-time nanny he had a crush on when they were teenagers more than 25 years ago. Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) is now the US Secretary State who is preparing for her presidential candidacy.Charlotte hires Fred to be her speechwriter in an effort to make her more personable, have more sense of humor, and increase her likability in preparation for her presidential run. In the process (and in an around the world tour that took them to several dozen countries), they became close to each other and rekindled their old romance. Of course, Charlotte has take on several world problems (e.g.,her negotiation for a climate change treaty, which was opposed by a Trump/Steve Bannon-like media mogul who is also a major campaign donor for the outgoing president). She was forced to make certain compromises in order to have a smooth presidential run and hence her relations with Fred became strained. However, at the last minute as she announced her candidacy she had a change of heart, had a 'let Charlotte be Charlotte' moment, and managed to reunited with Fred again. She won the presidential race and the two live happily ever after in the Oval Office.What I like about the movie:
Its a romantic comedy taking a place in a political setting, which was a popular genre in the 1990s in movies such as 'Dave' - the first lady falls in love with the president's stunt double who accidentally became president when the real one suffered from a stroke, 'The American President'- the president falls in love with an environmental activist/lobbyist, written by Aaron Sorkin during his pre-'West Wing' days, and 'My Fellow Americans' - two ex-presidents from different political parties and worldviews went on the run evading an assassin, travelling across America and met up with local citizens that were let down/lost their jobs as a result of the policies they adopted as presidents.'Long Shot' were written using the same plot formulas from these previous comedies - two people from very different background were joined together after a political event, worked together and finally fell in love with each other. You don't see this type of movies a lot these days and in a day full of hyper-partisanship, political scandals, and a seemingly run-amok President living inside the White House, you need this type of comedy to make you laugh and forget your troubles (as well as those of the world) for awhile.What factors the movie could be improved:
Charlotte's character, position, and the way they set up much of the stories - as a Secretary of State jet-setting all over the world to resolve the world's problems - seem to be based of another TV character from an ongoing TV series - Elizabeth McCord from 'Madam Secretary' (played by Tia Leoni). Just imagine the latter character to be approximately 15 years younger, single, has no kids, and can 'fool around' smoking Mollys once in a while and what you have Charlotte Field. Many of the characters playing Charlotte's senior staffs were also straight parodies from 'Madam Secretary' characters. Her chief of staff looks and behaves similarly with Elizabeth's CoS from the latter series (played by Bebe Neuwirth) and Charlotte's also has a staffer from Indian/Middle Eastern background (played by Geoffrey Arend in 'Madam Secretary). Charlotte and Elizabeth's, hairstyles, dresses, and mannerisms look so similar to each other that sometimes when watching the movie I referred to Charlotte as 'Beth' (McCord's nickname) instead of 'Charlotte.'In short, Charlize's character in the movie seems to be a parody of Tia Leoni's character from the series, with a few exceptions - she's younger, single, and more attractive. I noticed in the end credits that 'Madam Secretary's creator Barbara Hall serves as the series Executive Producer, which might explains why there's so many similarities between the two characters.While I enjoy Charlotte's character and I think Charlize did a good job portraying her, I wish there were more originality in terms of her character and persona so she doesn't strike me as a younger version of a pre-existing TV character with a similar job title and responsibilities. More exploration to what did she do prior to become Secretary of State (other than a Harvard graduate and a Rhodes scholar) might have done the trick - plus making her to look much more differently than her 'Madam Secretary' alter ego.Despite these shortcomings, I Found 'Long Shot' to be a funny and enjoyable romantic comedy in a political setting. It might have a Cinderella in reverse storyline that may not have come true in real life, plus, I think the way its main character was portrayed is too similar with another TV character, but it is still a fun and enjoyable movie for you and your family to see.",Long Shot

Unfortunately ot involves having to infantalize therons chracter enough to need help to the point shes on the floor and calling for help even though as secretary of state she would have had plenty of tough issies to deal with before him. I think my true criticism is how unlike the west wing or other political shoes show comedy. I know its not a comedy show but it rings alittle more true and believable.

778,raweirich,Horrible!,1,12 May 2019,A long shot that this waste of a movie makes any money. I had hoped that the usually obnoxious Rogen would have been tempered by Theron. Unfortunately not the case. He has only one way to be.,Long Shot
779,vickizielinski,Really funny,10,10 February 2020,Seth Rogen and Charlize Theron have amazing chemistry. Extremely funny. Really sweet at times.,Long Shot
780,splinteraaaa,A must watch !,10,27 August 2019,"The movie had great and smart humor, amazing atmosphere from the start. Charlize shines with stellar performance, you will simply fall in love. Great chemistry between Seth and her, you can just tell that they are great friends outside of the movie too. Also worth to mention the soundtracks were amazing and put you in good mood. Definitely worth watching multiple times.",Long Shot
781,montrealguy,More than I Expected,8,2 May 2019,After seeing the trailers for this film I knew that I would like it based on Seth Grogan's acting and Theran acting as his foil but it was much more than that. Yes it's a rom com but there's an underlying message about what we believe in as young people and if we can retain that in adult life. Every one will find something to like in this movie.,Long Shot
782,tonytimmons,Trump fans do not watch it's a Boring waste of time,2,30 August 2019,I am a Seth Rogen fan At least I was until watching this Horrible waste of Time political Hit job,Long Shot

785,david_mcgee,Terribly boring,1,20 May 2019,The jokes are very elementary and the plot is incredibly boring. I highly recommend not watching this as you both won't laugh or be entertained,Long Shot
786,ichuckpens,The romcom I've always wanted to see,10,1 August 2020,Super glad I had a chance to watch this. The humor works and the leads are amazingly believable. It was fun to watch them fall in love.,Long Shot
787,cartercrabs,DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT A 1 STAR MOVIE LOOKS LIKE,9,30 July 2019,"This is my first review and the only reason im doing it is because of all the 1 star hate its getting. People dont seem to understand that a 1 star review means that the acting, production, dialogue and plot are just complete trash. Now to start off i thought the acting was solid as was the production and dialogue the plot was ok i do understand how its a little far fetched. The only reason its getting hate is because of the president being a tv star and people think its trying to make fun of Trump. The movie itself was funny and heartwarming and people have to stop taking movies so serious i know in real life this would never happen but movies are for entertainment purposes and thats exactly what this movie did. Im not going to get into the plot because the trailer alone tells you everything you need to know. In conclusion if your looking for a funny romantic comedy this movie has it all and is a great watch.",Long Shot

791,lucasragnarwolder,Haven't laughed so hard in ages!,10,3 January 2020,"It's a feel good movie with lots of laughs that don't seem old or forced. Seth Rogen's silliness in his role is just the right amount.
Plus it's 2 hours long, so more time to enjoy a good movie!",Long Shot
792,davetoni,Non-stop laughs!,10,25 April 2019,"Looking to be entertained, then this is the movie to see. Funny throughout! Seth and Charlize make a great team, sweet and spicy.

793,kelemencsaba-11939,The filmmakers would also have employed a writer,3,24 June 2019,We live on a planet where The Big Bang Theory was produced. I don't believe Hollywood can't get a writer for a decent comedy.,Long Shot

796,sanaattta,Great movie- don't understand the bad reviews!,10,25 July 2019,"I don't understand why so many people are giving this movie low ratings. I usually don't find comedy films that are unnecessarily vulgar entertaining, but Long Shot had the perfect amount of crude humour and a likeable storyline to carry it. People are complaining that it was unrealistic, but I don't think it was ever intentioned to be believable? It was a funny movie with a happy ending, what else do you want!",Long Shot

800,artprelle,Emasculated unfunny waste,1,10 August 2019,Seth Rogan plays a completely emasculated millennial. The comedy is not funny at all. I didn't laugh once. ST has really lost his talent.,Long Shot
