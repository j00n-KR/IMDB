0,TheLittleSongbird,"Decent thriller, carried by Morgan Freeman and a strong cast",7,6 May 2010,"Overall I enjoyed Along Came a Spider, it wasn't absolutely brilliant, but it sets out to be a good thriller and does that. Even with some plot implausibilities, a so-so performance from Monica Potter and one or two moments of forced pacing, it is well made and suspenseful. The cinematography is skillful and stylish, and the music is nicely done and adds to the suspense. The pace in general is brisk, apart from it being forced on occasions when it tried to fit in too many plot twists, and the story springs from an interesting concept. The script has some very good moments, and the direction is very good. The performances apart from Monica Potter are strong, with Morgan Freeman great as always and Michael Wincott solid as the kidnapper. Mika Boorem shows promise as a blossoming young actress, and Penelope Ann Miller does a very nice job as her mother. Overall, decent thriller, with problems, but carried by its cast primarily. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Along Came a Spider
1,bkoganbing,Invited on the hunt,6,3 May 2015,"Morgan Freeman made his second appearance as police detective/profiler Alex Cross in Along Came The Spider. Cross is a man of both thought and action and Freeman certainly covers both aspects of his character well.Michael Wincott plays a master criminal who Cross has been on the trail of in the past. His latest scheme involves the kidnapping of young Mika Boorem who is the daughter of US Senator Michael Moriarty. The young lady rates some Secret Service protection which is never really gone into other than possibly Moriarty is announced candidate for president.But her detail which is in the charge of Monica Potter is completely outfoxed by Wincott in disguise who snatches Boorem right from the grounds of an exclusive school that she attends. Wincott then practically invites his old adversary Freeman in on the hunt by sending an article of clothing that Boorem wore to Freeman's house.What seems to be a battle of wits between Freeman and Wincott at first is far from that. There are a couple of other players in this game and they just might be holding the winning hand.I really was impressed with how Freeman got into all aspects of Detective Alex Cross. This man is intelligent and compassionate and is not easily fooled. Those other players in the game think they've got Freeman bamboozled, but he's far from that.Along Came A Spider is an intelligent action thriller with major kudos going to Morgan Freeman for his portrayal of Alex Cross.",Along Came a Spider
2,SnoopyStyle,Morgan Freeman great but hate the twist,6,29 June 2014,Detective profiler Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) loses his partner after the perp drives them over a dam. He's been hiding ever since. Senator (Michael Moriarty)'s daughter Megan Rose (Mika Boorem) is kidnapped under secret service agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter)'s watch. The kidnapper is disguised as teacher Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott). He calls up Cross to get him back into the game. Agent Ollie McArthur (Dylan Baker) is now in charge. Agent Ben Devine (Billy Burke) is also in trouble along with Flannigan. Cross teams up with Flannigan who has known Soneji for the last 2 years. It's a cat and mouse game where Soneji seems to be inspired by the Lindbergh baby kidnapping.Morgan Freeman reprises his Alex Cross role from 'Kiss the Girls' replacing Ashley Judd with Monica Potter. They form a good team. I like him in this role. He is more cerebral than muscle. It's got good tension. It's on track for a very good thriller. Then the twist comes and the logic goes all to heck. This could have been better. At least we still have Morgan Freeman.,Along Came a Spider
3,kosmasp,Just don't get tangled up,8,23 September 2021,"In its web that is .. who the spider is you ask? I have not read the book this is based on, but I reckon if you have you will know more than the average viewer. I know that this Alex Cross version - well I like it a lot more than the movie that was released a decade later - no offense to any Tyler Perry fan, but I think even you'd agree that Morgan Freeman is the better actor and fit here.That aside you have to suspend your disbelief ... the character name might be an indicator of certain things. Whether you can guess certain things (casting wise) or are surprised by how the story evolves, it is more than a ""fun ride"" - all in the context of this being a movie. Obviously not condoning the despicable behaviour of anyone evil in this ...",Along Came a Spider
4,classicsoncall,"""I'm living proof that a mind is a terrible thing.""",7,27 December 2018,"While it plays out, the story can be quite compelling, but after the fact when you begin to think about it, some of the intrigue wears off. The kids for example, Megan Rose (Mika Boorem) and Dimitri Starodubov (Anton Yelchin) were clever beyond their years in evaluating the situations they were in. What twelve year old is examining his escape route for observation cameras in order to time his run to safety? Or in Megan's case, not jumping at the chance to be saved when Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) shows up to release her from the room she was being held captive in. Who stops to question why a person you'd trust is there by themselves?But while it's going on, there are enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing, as Detective Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) again steps out of the pages of a James Patterson novel to take on a cunning adversary. Freeman's probably your main reason to see the picture, he's methodical and resolute, but with more than his fair share of implausible assumptions that always turn out to be correct. 'Aces and Eights' is just one that comes immediately to mind.There used to be a television commercial for the United Negro College Fund that stated 'A mind is a terrible thing to waste'. Kidnapper Sonneji (Michael Wincott) must have seen it enough times to adapt it to his particular circumstances attempting to taunt and outwit Detective Cross. He should have known Cross went to school too, as the only thing that got wasted here were all the bad guys.",Along Came a Spider
5,jboothmillard,Along Came a Spider,6,15 June 2005,"I didn't realise the leading actor's character is from another film, Kiss the Girls, but I think this is the much better crime drama thriller. A young little girl is kidnapped and ransomed by a very clever but unknown criminal living on a boat. Morgan Freeman is the detective hired to try and find the girl, he recently lost his partner in a car accident and is still trying to forget it. He has a look at the last place the parents of the girl saw her and he discovers that nothing has been moved or touched and he planned the kidnap very carefully, as sly as a spider (hence the title) Monica Potter (from Patch Adams) is partnered with Freeman to help him, and he doesn't know it, but she is involved with the kidnapper and she turns into a real bitch. Good!",Along Came a Spider
6,ccthemovieman-1,Slightly Above Average Despite Some Credibility Problems,7,2 August 2006,"Crime story-wise, this was nothing extraordinary but was a pretty solid film. He isn't always like this, but Morgan Freeman does best in films where he's the likable hero-cop. He is definitely that in this film although his character, Alex Cross, is a little too sharp for believability. There were just a bit too many ""oh, come on's"" said by me watching this as Cross would get computer passwords with no trouble, etc. The odds of that happening are millions-to-one but not in the world of films. There were other examples, too, of him figuring out things that were almost impossible.For a tough modern-day crime story this film, for the most part, was pretty low- key with low profanity and not a lot of gore or overdone action. That was surprising considering the sordid subject matter. The tameness in here, and Freeman, make this a notch (albeit a small one) above the average thriller.",Along Came a Spider
7,rmax304823,A Mind is a Terrible Thing,6,6 December 2002,"This is a strictly routine kidnapping crime thriller. Morgan Freeman is the profiler/cop who delves into the criminal's mind. Monica Potter is his cop partner. It's a shame to see a marvelous actor like Freedman wasted on trite stuff like this. He has an endearingly lumpy face and a soothing voice, the kind of guy you wouldn't mind going to for reassurance when you're in doubt. He can be mighty mean too, as in ""Street Smart."" Potter is as glamorous as all get-out. She looks a little and sounds a lot like Julia Roberts, a comparison that must make her physically ill by now. Unfortunately her voice is flat and toneless and her face mostly expressionless. She'd be a great model though. The kidnapper of a senator's little girl is Michael Wincott, a very expressive face and a voice that sounds filtered through a coffee grinder. He has a bony face, rather like a weasel or ferret, but not necessarily villainous, a term that in my view is slung around much too loosely. I myself am eminently handsome yet I too have been described as ""villainous."" I didn't mind it from my ex wife but it can be unnerving when brought up independently in the confessional and in a shrink's office. The script has nothing original in it. The dialog is by the numbers, the characters and their interactions not very interesting. The action, and there is a lot of action, as is standard in routine thrillers, takes place in Washington, DC, and makes use of many recognizable locations. One rather lengthy sequence is lifted straight out of the Ann Mary Deacon incident in ""Dirty Harry,"" the writers beginning to run dry I guess. Something to do with the Lindbergh kidnapping is introduced ominously and then left to flop around, gasping, until it expires. A couple of plot twists at the end can't save this damaged script. The most surprising thing about it is that Dylan Baker, as the head FBI man, usually a dilatory figure, has a chilling face, and begins by chewing out Freeman, a local cop, because of a turf conflict. But then, in the very next scene, he apologizes and offers to help as much as he can -- and he means it too! It's diverting but no more than that.",Along Came a Spider
8,Tweekums,Solid enough thriller with a double twist,7,14 October 2016,"This film starts with protagonist Detective Alex Cross losing his partner when an operation goes badly wrong; the action then jumps forward several months and he is now retired. Inevitably he doesn't stay retired long a teacher at an exclusive school kidnaps Megan Rose, the young daughter of a US Senator, from under the noses of the Secret Service than calls Cross and leaves her shoe in his mail box. This gets Cross onto the case and he is soon partnered with Secret Service agent Jezzie Flannigan; she was responsible for Megan's protection and understandably wants to see her found; she also had knowledge of the kidnapper from her time at the school. The kidnapper quickly changes his appearance and takes her onto his boat; every so often calling Cross. It is clear that the kidnapper's motive is to be famous; just before the kidnapping he was talking to his class about Charles Lindbergh; the man whose baby was the victim of in of the most infamous kidnappings in American History. As the story continues he attempts a second kidnapping and when that is foiled there is a demand for a large ransom; his behaviour is changing in ways that puzzles Cross. This all leads to a conclusion that features two twists in rapid succession; neither of which I'll spoil here.Not having read the book and not seeing the previous film for many years I had no preconceptions about the film. It started well but then it became clear that it would be a fairly routine mystery with quite a few clichés do real criminals ever call the police just to play a game with somebody they think could be a worthy adversary? That said it is far from a bad film; the story moves at a decent pace and there are plenty of tense moments. The final twist was somewhat melodramatic but at least it came as a bit of a surprise. The acting is pretty solid; Morgan Freeman is impressive as Alex Cross and Monica Potter makes a good female lead as Jezzie Flannigan. The supporting cast is pretty good too; Mika Boorem in particular impressed as Megan; child characters can be irritating but she wasn't even if the character was a bit too precocious at times. Overall this is a pretty solid film; not a must see but still worth watching if it is on TV.",Along Came a Spider
9,blanche-2,slow at times but still good,6,9 February 2003,"This film is well worth seeing.  First of all, Morgan Freeman is always worth seeing.  Secondly, Monica Potter is definitely Julia Roberts in a blond wig.  I guess Julia works as Monica when they can't pay her the full salary.  I mean, it was Julia right down to the voice.  Anyway, Along Came a Spider was produced by Freeman and, though it moves slowly at times, is still entertaining and has some really sustained suspense going for it. Other than the pace, my criticism would be that the little girl's character was just a little too smart.  Way too smart.  If a screenwriter submitted this film to a contest or a class, that would have been the main comment. Which just goes to show you - keep writing and don't listen to anyone. Someone will like what you do.",Along Came a Spider
10,Quinoa1984,Clever if sometimes not that great thriller,7,6 April 2001,"Along Came a Spider is a suspense film about a cop who goes into a case with a man who has kidnapped a little girl just for fame.  While the film may have some over-acting and loopholes (I won't go into them here because they are spoilers), the film is also a clever chiller with good, if squirming, twists and a performance by Freeman which is great as always (in fact nearly every minute Freeman is on the screen he's compelling).

Detective Alex Cross(Morgan Freeman),on sick leave recovering from the lose of his partner, is called back into action when the daughter of Senator Rose(Michael Moriarty) is kidnapped from her private school. Cross is an expert profiler and is very successful in tracking down elusive criminals.Michael Wincott plays the savvy kidnapper. Also in the cast are: Monica Potter, Mika Boorem and Dylan Baker. Penelope Ann Miller is the Senator's wife. Very tense mood throughout with Freeman strong and steady. Probably the best acting is turned in by easy on the eye Ms. Potter.The kidnapper has the detective hurrying to keep pace in the race to save the little girl's life.

12,sunwarrior13,A Watchable Idiotic Thriller,8,12 October 2012,"Along Came a Spider is a thriller adapted from the novel of the same title by James Patterson although but many of the key plot elements of the book were eliminated.It stars Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross together with Monica Potter,Penelope Ann Miller,Michael Wincott,Dylan Baker,Mika Boorem,Billy Burke,Anton Yelchin and Jay O. Sanders.The screenplay by Marc Moss and it was directed by Lee Tamahori.Gary Soneji is a brilliant but remorseless psychopath who has landed a teaching position at an exclusive private school in Washington, D.C. Using his extensive knowledge of kidnapping, Soneji abducts one of his students - Megan, whose father Hank Rose is a United States senator. Ollie MacArthur, the detective investigating the case, has strong words for Jezzie Flannigan, the Secret Service agent who mistakenly let Megan slip through her fingers. But when the kidnapper contacts Dr. Cross, the psychologist is brought in on the case, and Cross seeks out Flannigan, who he believes might have a valuable insight into the case. Soon, Cross and Flannigan come to the terrible realization that this crime only represents the tip of the iceberg for the ruthless Soneji.Director Lee Tamahori and screenwriter Marc Moss treat their star with all due respect, and manage to turn out an engrossing, entertaining movie in the process.But still,it isn't a smart thriller like Se7en or Copycat.Instead, it's more of a watchable idiotic thriller.",Along Came a Spider
13,Theo Robertson,Perhaps Too Many Twists,6,19 September 2004,"ALONG CAME A SPIDER gets off to a surprising start due to its downbeat opening , though I must confess it was spoiled slightly by its CGI a problem this director had with DIE ANOTHER DAY , but it still retains a certain impact lacking in a lot of Hollywood movies these days which gave me hope that I'd be watching an above average thriller Truth be told ALONG CAME A SPIDER was above average but only by present day standards . The premise of having the daughter of a senator kidnapped isn't all that different from the very overrated SILENCE OF THE LAMBS ( And umpteen other thrillers of this ilk ) so in order for it to stand out we're treated to a lot of plot twists . Unfortunately I think we have a couple of twists too many by the end of the film . Remember that line "" With your TV switched up loud a whole SWAT team could have come in here unnoticed "" ? Didn't you just know by this point that another twist was going to happen and that it held no more surprises ? Not to be totally negative this is a very entertaining thriller for the most part and as you can expect Morgan Freeman is always good to watch",Along Came a Spider
14,Doylenf,Morgan Freeman solves a web of deception...,5,10 September 2006,"This enjoyable little crime story, taken from a novel by James Patterson, has the requisite twists and turns that one always finds in a thriller of this sort--and, as usual, there are a few above average performances in the cast. But so much of the plot defies credibility that you really have to accept a lot of implausible events to begin to enjoy the tale. The opening scene, though, is a good one and has a way of hooking you into the story very effectively.MORGAN FREEMAN is quietly authoritative as a man who seems to have no trouble cracking cases, especially those involving complicated technologies like computers. He merely has to sit in front of one to immediately detect the probable password and the various wiz techniques underneath photos where encrypted messages lie waiting for his detection with a flick of his finger over the keyboard. Highly unlikely that a man of his age would be this computer savvy in the first place--which is probably why, in the original novel, the man was a much younger detective.MONICA POTTER makes a pretty helpmate but goes through her role in a rather expressionless way, as though afraid to give too much away if she changed her fixed stare.Most impressive among the supporting players is MICHAEL WINCOTT as the sinister mastermind of a kidnapping, who gets his kicks by taunting the lead detective on the case with improbable phone calls detailing how the detective must comply with innumerable directions if he wants the kidnapper to release the girl, who is the daughter of a wealthy senator and his wife. His explicit directions are just too complex and readily followed by Freeman in a manner that defies any common sense or credibility.But if you swallow these improbabilities, the story is a swift moving one under Lee Tomahori's direction. Never clear are anyone's motivations, another flaw in an otherwise fairly engaging detective yarn that passes the time.",Along Came a Spider
15,preppy-3,OK crime thriller,7,21 May 2001,"Morgan Freeman, with Monica Potter tagging along, goes after the kidnapper of a senator's daughter.  The picture has a quick, violent, slam-bang opening then quiets down.  The plot is very familiar and the script has some dull moments.  Also, at the end, the film throws all plausibility out the window and throws in some totally unbelievable twists and turns.  Thinking about them after the movie, I realized that they made absolutely no sense and couldn't have even happened!  Two performances save the movie--Morgan Freeman, good as always and Michael Wincott who's very good as the kidnapper.  He gives the character a lot of depth and is riveting whenever he's on screen.  Monica Potter, however, is terrible.  It's not entirely her fault...her part is very poorly written and things happen to her character at the end that come out of nowhere.  So, all in all, just an OK movie. There are worse movies of its type, but there are better ones also.",Along Came a Spider
16,LeonLouisRicci,The Sequel Spins Erratically,5,10 May 2016,"After a Cool Credit Sequence and a Kinetic Car Crash Opening Scene the Movie Descends into a Rather Lame and Pretentious Story that becomes Less Thrilling as things move along with No Sense of Style, a Dull Screenplay and Dialog, and just about Everything in This Thing keeps it from becoming a Thrilling Thriller.The First Alex Cross Movie, 'Kiss the Girls"" (1997) was so much Better. Morgan Freeman returns here because the First Film was a Taut, Tight and Mysterious Success. It was Interesting, but this one is Not.Nothing seems to work. It's got a Decent Cast that cannot do anything to Save this Clunker.

17,lastliberal,Morgan Freeman IS Alex Cross,7,24 March 2007,"Fans of Detective Alex Cross will not be disappointed in this film adaptation of the book. Morgan Freeman, one of my very favorites, does an outstanding job of translating Cross to the big screen. So the script wasn't the best and there are implausible details in the film that will give you pause, it is always worth two hours of your time to see Morgan Freeman. As one reviewer states, ""Freeman's performance -- one of laser-like perspicacity shining through eyes made narrow by a laconic, been-there-done-that cool -- is the film's ramrod-true spine."" So, don't get too worked up over details and just enjoy Freeman and the lovely Monica Potter (Con Air, Saw).",Along Came a Spider
18,zardoz-13,Morgan Freeman surpasses himself again with . . .,6,8 February 2008,"Morgan Freeman surpasses himself again with another scrupulously nuanced performance in director Lee Tamahori's old-fashioned but perhaps far too ingenious kidnap caper ""Along Came a Spider."" ""Con-Air's"" Monica Potter, ""Crow"" nemesis Michael Wincott, and Penelope Ann Miller co-star with Freeman.Unfortunately, this above-average, old-fashioned, but preposterous murder-mystery thriller grabs you by the jugular at the outset with a terrific wreck, then gradually looses its grip and becomes an anticlimactic, standard-issue, cat & mouse, ransom potboiler. Happily, director Lee Tamahori never lets the narrative elements encumber the action. The sound transitions jump out at you, while scenarist Marc Moss triggers one surprise after another in whiplash succession to keep you guessing until our protagonist discovers the last thing that even he had expected. Altogether, ""Spider"" qualifies as a solid, respectable, entertaining, middle-of-the-road Agatha Christie thriller with no nudity but a body count. The hero is virtuous, and the villains are the spawn of evil. Older, more mature audiences will appreciate this psychological police story.Freeman reprises his ""Kiss the Girls"" role as Washington, D.C. Detective Dr. Alex Cross, a famous forensic psychiatrist with several books to his credit. When Cross's undercover partner dies in a botched field operation, he cannot forgive himself and retires. No sooner has Cross put himself out to pasture than he finds himself drawn into a kidnapping by the kidnapper! Apparently, elite public school teacher Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott) has strangled a teacher and abducted a U.S. Senator's daughter. As Cross watches the TV news coverage about the crime, Soneji rings him up and notifies him about the evidence he stashed in Cross's mail box. Cross finds a shoe that belonged to Megan Rose Dunne (Mika Boorem of ""The Patriot"") and joins the investigation. Disgraced Special Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), who supervised the around-the-clock surveillance on Megan, blames herself for Megan's abduction. Although the Feds want nothing to do with her, Cross teams up with Flannigan to track down the elusive Soneji. The trigger-happy Soneji wants Cross on the case so that he can document Soneji's crime of the century in a book and compare it with the tragic Lindbergh baby abduction..As kidnap capers go, ""Spider"" assembles all the standard conventions. Indeed, when the authorities trace Soneji's phone call, he gets off the line just before they can locate him. Later, when the villain issues his random demand, he sends Detective Cross hustling across the nation's capital on foot, answering various phones in multiple locations to see if our hero is acting alone without back-up. Naturally, Cross has Flannigan following him in a nearby car with an earpiece serving as a two-way radio while he scrambles from one phone booth to the next. Anybody that saw either Don Siegel's ""Dirty Harry"" or Ron Howard's ""Ransom"" knows this old trick.This time around the bad guy demands $10-million in untraceable diamonds. Clearly, Tamahori and Moss borrow the stunt of having Cross pitch a thermos of diamonds from a moving commuter train to the criminal, similar to what happened in Akira Kurosawa's 1962 Japanese kidnap caper ""High and Low."" Along the way, our heroes learn Soneji has more in mind than simply kidnapping the daughter of a little-known Congressman and extorting millions from him.During the last twenty minutes of ""Spider,"" the revelations fly as thick as the gunfire punctuating them. Predictably, the FBI is nowhere in sight when Cross cracks the case and rescue Megan. James Patterson's novel provided the source for the film. Although the author's ""Kiss the Girls"" showed up a the first cinematic Cross mystery, ""Spider"" itself actually appeared in print before ""Girls."" Tamahori and Moss toe the line on violence.You see several people getting shot, and you see brief spurts of blood erupt from their clothing, but the filmmakers never linger on those gory images. Similarly, apart from some harrowing moments involving Soneji's handling of Megan, Tamahori and Moss display great restraint and shun any urge to introduce perverted sexual elements.Alas, ""Spider"" is in a sense anticlimactic because nothing occurs after the tragic opening car crash scene that matches it in terms of action so the filmmakers work overtime in twisting and turning the plot until it resembles a pretzel. Younger audiences may find ""Along Comes a Spider"" bland and less than compelling, but traditional whodunit fans will appreciate both its red herrings and surprises, even if this well-made nail-biter breaks no new ground.",Along Came a Spider
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not spectacular, but pretty much what one comes to expect from Lee Tamahori",7,16 January 2005,"After seeing The Edge and Mulholland Falls, I can't say I'm really surprised by the quality of this film. Still, I have to say that I did find this movie to be quite entertaining and thought it did what it was supposed to do, for a mystery-thriller. It takes off almost immediately, and succeeds in being thoroughly interesting. The plot is pretty good, and experiencing it unravel is pretty intriguing, possibly even more-so than that of other later and contemporary thrillers. The pacing is solid. The acting is good; Freeman is stellar as always, and Potter gives a convincing performance. Wincott surprised me with the high quality of his acting, but maybe that's because I've only seen him in Alien: Resurrection, and that movie can make even the most impressive actor seem talentless. Boorem was pretty good for a child-actor, but I have seen better(even at younger ages), so it's no massive accomplishment. The characters are fairly well-written and interesting, but I'm not sure they're entirely credible. The dialog is fairly well-written and equally well-delivered. The special effects are pretty standard stuff, except for a short car-sequence in the beginning which looked entirely convincing. I'm almost certain I know how they did it, but at the moment I saw it, I didn't think about it at all. They pulled that off quite nicely, I think. The film is, like many other recent thrillers, kept going through a number of plot twists, one more unlikely than the other. This is unfortunate, but it seems like that's the way thrillers are going these days. I will say that the twists could have been much, much worse. Overall, a standard mystery-thriller with a good cast and good for at least one attentive viewing. I recommend this to fans of one or more of the actors, the director(if he actually has fans, that is) and/or of the mystery and thriller genres. 7/10",Along Came a Spider
20,view_and_review,Some Movies Deserve Sequels,7,15 January 2021,"Some movies deserve sequels and some do not. Those that do deserve a sequel can be because a character is so intriguing or the plot itself is something that can be serialized. Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) deserved a sequel.In this sequel to ""Kiss the Girls"" Dr. Cross is dealing with another kidnapper, but this time the kidnapper has kidnapped an actual kid instead of adult women. The kidnapper is known from the beginning. He kidnapped a high profile victim named Megan Rose (Mika Boorem), a senator's daughter.Dr. Cross would not have been a part of this investigation at all, except that the kidnapper, Mr. Soneji (Michael Wincott), intentionally roped Dr. Cross into it. Cross had been licking his wounds after a partner of his was killed in a sting operation eight months prior. Mr. Soneji should've, as the saying goes, ""Let sleeping dogs lie.""""Along Came a Spider"" isn't quite as edgy and suspenseful as ""Kiss the Girls,"" but as Jamie Kennedy said in ""Scream 2,"" ""Sequels are by definition an inferior product."" Having said that, ACAS could be inferior to KTG and still be a superb movie. They did opt for a similar plot twist in that the secret service agent, Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), helping in the case was one of the perpetrators. However, they partially made up for such a repeat by killing the blond-haired, blue-eyed, female antagonist. That is double-rainbow-with-unicorns-beneath-them rare. And rarer still is that she was killed by a Black male protagonist (don't want to conjure up those images). The standoff between the two was a bit anticlimactic and seemed more of a formality as they needed to wrap up the movie somehow. All in all I still liked ACS and like a Jack Ryan or Jason Bourned I would love to see more Dr. Alex Cross.",Along Came a Spider

22,anaconda-40658,When Will a Decent Screenwriter Come Along?,4,1 June 2015,"Along Came a Spider (2001): Dir: Lee Tarahori / Cast: Morgan Freeman, Monica Potter, Michael Wincott, Billy Burke, Dylan Baker: Prequel to Kiss the Girls referring to numerous spiders, one little girl, and the detective they intend to frighten. Alex Cross is introduced in an unnecessary opening sequence where he loses a partner. He leaves work for eight months resorting to alcohol. The Senator's daughter is kidnapped by a professor and her shoe is found in Cross's mailbox. He pairs with guilt-ridden Monica Potter who was in charge of the victim. Director Lee Tarahori allows information to surface. He previously made a much better film in The Edge. Effective plot turns hardly make up for the numerous shortcomings. Freeman is a great film presence but his opening here barely matters to the rest of the film. The only notable element is that he will only use violence as a last resort. Potter is also cardboard until the third act where she becomes more interesting. Michael Wincott plays the villain, which is hardly a surprise since he seems to be the top of the list for actors to play villains. Billy Burke also makes an appearance until he is killed off. Dylan Baker is another talent who has been better used in other films. While Kiss the Girls is hardly great suspense, it at least had a premise and superior production, while this film spins a web of total nothingness. Score: 4 / 10",Along Came a Spider

She turns out to be the daughter of a senator, and the kidnapper soon makes a call to Alex Cross whose partner died eight months ago, involving him in the kidnapping. One of the secret service people that failed to protect the girl at the school decides to help him. But not everything is what is seems......Kiss the girls was a very good thriller, it excelled partly because it was released on the back end of Se7en, and Freeman was the Pearson of choice to play this sort of role.Plus, it was released at a time when thrillers were pretty similar, and this stood out a little bit more.Jump four years, and we have this second Cross movie, which to be fair, is very, very average indeed.If it wasn't for Wincott and Freeman, this film would have been a bomb. Freeman can dot his stuff in his sleep, and is good company to be with, And Wincott, well after The Crow and Strange Days, I'd watch him in anything.But thanks to the poor narrative, script, and a really bad Monica Potter, this film just happens, and never really stands out like its predecessor.It's one of those films that you will see, be disappointed in, and then a few years later see it again to see if it's got better with age.Believe me, it doesn't, and the recent Alex Cross is better.",Along Came a Spider
24,Wuchakk,"Good, but farfetched with an eye-rolling 'big reveal'",5,20 June 2020,"D.C. forensic psychologist Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) investigates when a senator's daughter is kidnapped from a private school by a man obsessed with the infamous Lindbergh abduction (Michael Wincott). A secret service agent at the school assists him on the case (Monica Potter).""Along Came a Spider"" (2001) is an improbable detective thriller like its predecessor ""Kiss the Girls"" (1997) except that it doesn't rip-off ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) or ""Se7en"" (1995). Both were based on the books by James Patterson.The opening is great with a thrilling dam sequence. The ensuing story of the kidnapping & investigation is compelling but, like the first film, a plot wrench is thrown into the works that muddles everything. I can roll with that, but not the absurd 'big reveal' at the end, which comes off as a wannabe ""Fooled ya"" by the writers. They might've fooled me, but they also ruined the movie with the eye-rolling twist.Like ""Kiss the Girls,"" ""Along Came a Spider"" is worthwhile if you like proficient detective thrillers and the cast, but be prepared for a wildly unrealistic tale.The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the Vancouver area, British Columbia, and Owings Mills/Baltimore, Maryland (the train sequence), with establishing shots of Washington DC.GRADE: C",Along Came a Spider

26,JamesHitchcock,"Unconvincing, Hackneyed and Cliché-Ridden",4,7 December 2007,"""Along Came a Spider"" makes use of two of the most overworked clichés of the modern crime drama. The first is the criminal who commits his crimes as a sort of intellectual exercise and then plays games with the police by deliberately leaving them clues. In reality, of course, most criminals are motivated either by greed or by strong emotions such as anger, hatred or jealousy rather than by the desire to commit the perfect crime for its own sake; Leopold and Loeb may have been exceptions, but even they were not stupid enough to taunt the police in the manner of some fictional criminals. The second cliché of which the film-makers are guilty is that of the twist, the sudden revelation of information, previously withheld from the audience, which makes them aware that the true situation is not what they had previously been led to believe. Such twists normally occur towards the end of the film, and often involve the disclosure of information about the identity or motivation of one or more of the characters.The modern fashion for the pseudo-intellectual criminal, who commits crimes so that he can play a sort of mental chess with the detective, seems to have started with ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (in itself a reasonably good film). This fashion was followed in weaker films such as the overrated ""Se7en"" and the predictable ""The Bone Collector"". The villain in ""Along Came a Spider"" is not (as in the examples quoted above) a serial killer but a kidnapper. His real name appears to be Jonathan Mercusio, but in the film he is normally referred to by his alias Gary Soneji. Soneji poses as a teacher in order to infiltrate an exclusive boarding school and kidnap the daughter of a senator. Soneji, who is obsessed with the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case from the thirties, then contacts the police to let them know what he has done and to give clues as to the girl's whereabouts. The title of the film derives from a comparison made between Soneji and a spider.The investigation of the crime is entrusted to Alex Cross, the Washington Police Department detective originally contacted by Soneji, and Jezzie Flanagan, the female Secret Service agent who was assigned to protect the girl and who failed to prevent her kidnapping. Like Jezzie, Cross is haunted by guilt, in his case over an earlier incident in which a female partner was killed. Like ""The Bone Collector"", ""Along Came a Spider"" teams an older African-American male detective with a younger white female one. In both cases the female character has an Irish surname (Donaghy in the earlier film).Morgan Freeman is a highly talented actor, as he showed in films such as ""Driving Miss Daisy"", ""Glory"" and ""Unforgiven"", but his talents are often wasted in routine thrillers; ""Along Came a Spider"" is an example, and his next film ""High Crimes"" another. (Freeman also played the detective in ""Se7en""; I have not seen ""Kiss the Girls"", the other film in which he played the role of Alex Cross). Monica Potter gives a rather wooden performance as Jezzie; she is not as good as Angelina Jolie, who played the equivalent role in ""The Bone Collector"", and certainly not as good as Jodie Foster in ""The Silence of the Lambs"".I won't say what the twist is that occurs near the end of the film, as I don't want to write a spoiler, although I must say it is not a credible one. Indeed, it has the effect of casting doubt on most of what has gone before, converting a believable if routine thriller into one that makes no sense at all. (John Schlesinger achieved a similarly dubious feat the previous year in ""Reindeer Games"", which featured not one but two separate twists). The writers of crime fiction, especially scriptwriters for films like this, generally have far more fertile imaginations than do the criminals themselves; consequently fictitious criminals tend to hatch over-complicated and unworkable schemes which no real-life criminal would entertain for a minute. ""Along Came a Spider"" is the sort of unconvincing, hackneyed, cliché-ridden thriller of which Hollywood has been churning out far too many in recent years. 4/10",Along Came a Spider
27,namashi_1,Above-Average...,6,4 July 2010,"Adapted from the 1993 novel of the same title by James Patterson, 'Along Came A Spider' begins deliciously, but ends quite bland. Lee Tamahori knows the subject well, but the end could've really been better.Freeman stars as a disturbed detective, forensic psychologist, and author who is brought back in the game after a important personality's daughter gets kidnapped. The idea, as said is crispy and the film beings with a bang! The first 40-minutes are damn good. Sadly, the excitement is sloshed when the actual culprit is reveled. It doesn't come across as a shock, and that's it's biggest disadvantage. Tamahori's direction is super, while Marc Moss's adapted screenplay is flawed.In the acting department, Morgan Freeman is fantastic. The screen legend sinks his teeth into the character from start to end. Monica Potter is very good. Michael Wincott does not deliver. He makes a devilish character into a caricature.On the whole, It's an above-average thriller. One-time watch!",Along Came a Spider
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,Hail Surprise!,5,28 December 2006,"Well, this morning I was looking for a movie to watch before I went to work and my mom recommended Along Came A Spider, we are both Morgan Freeman fans, so I figured to give the movie a shot, despite typical endings when you see a Morgan Freeman thriller. So the movie started off really strong, but ended up flaking as usual to a ""big surprise"" ending that well... wasn't that all surprising. I don't know, I guess I'm just too smart for my own good because I could just see everything that was going to happen, while it was an alright thriller, I wasn't that impressed with the way things peeled out.Well, Morgan Freeman who plays Alex, has just lost his partner in a under cover crime gone fatally wrong and he has retired, until that is, he gets a phone call from a mysterious man who has just kidnapped the senator's daughter and for some odd reason, doesn't want a ransom for the girl. The secret service lady, Jezzie, who was supposed to be guarding the little girl failed to protect her and well, things of course are not always as they seem.I just don't want to give any spoilers, for those who haven't seen those movies, you know the typical thrillers that are supposed to have a big surprise ending? But any who, it's an average thriller at least in my opinion, the acting wasn't bad or anything, I guess just for a while, you see one thriller, you've seen them all, right? But Morgan does still rock, I will never deny his credit, therefore I will be kind over all and say for the rating.5/10",Along Came a Spider
29,=G=,C+,6,31 October 2001,"""Along Came a Spider"", with Freeman leading the way as a super sleuth cop who sets about to solve the kidnapping of a Senator's daughter, is strictly Hollywood formula film-making. The flick follows the rules, lacks in creativity, twists and turns a little in the middle, and provides a modicum of entertainment. With the always good Freeman and the always delicious Potter in the foreground, there's little to fault and little to rave about in this middle-of-the-road thriller.",Along Came a Spider

When a congressman's daughter is kidnapped, he is back on the workforce and sees that the kidnapper has a personal vendetta with him.There is some mystery and a little kick-butt action in this film that will surely keep the audience at least mildly entertained. The story is straightforward and simple, but provides for a good conventional thriller. Freeman is intelligent, thoughtful and committed in his role as Cross and Monica Potter is an attractive and unpredictable FBI agent, determined to help Cross nab the kidnapper.With limited action and tension, I have, however, seen more exciting thrillers than this.

31,sddavis63,Disappointing But Not Terrible,5,8 June 2003,"As a fan of Morgan Freeman, I anxiously anticipated watching this movie for the first time, and unfortunately I have to say that I found it to be one of Freeman's weaker movies. Freeman was cast as Det. Alex Cross, a police profiler who gets involved in helping to solve the kidnapping of a relatively unimportant Senator's daughter. (Michael Moriarty underwhelmed me in a somewhat limited role as Senator Rose, while Mika Boorem - whose performance I enjoyed in Hearts In Atlantis - came across well here as his daughter. I look for her to have a big future.)The first hour or so of the movie, however, was especially weak and rather tedious. Cross struggled with the question of why such an unimportant senator's daughter would be the target of a kidnapping - so did I, and it was never really made clear, although I understand the connection between Meghan and Dimitri (Anton Yelchin, also an alumnus from Hearts In Atlantis; he and Boorem work very well together.) It just seemed a rather circuitous route for Soneji (Michael Wincott) to take to achieve his ultimate goal.To give credit where credit is due, the story picked up speed in the last half and became a decent whodunit story, and I had not predicted the ending involving Jezzie (Monica Potter.) So, this isn't a terrible movie, but it certainly isn't one of the better ones of Morgan Freeman's career.5/10",Along Came a Spider
32,Lejink,Double Cross,5,19 December 2019,"The second film adaptation of a James Patterson crime novel starring Morgan Freeman as profiling detective Alex Cross. The film starts with Cross's female partner dying in a botched sting operation being run by Cross against a suspected murderer. This badly affects Cross who goes into a prolonged leave of absence before he gets drawn, for reasons not exactly made clear, into a sophisticated kidnap plot which sees the young daughter of a U.S. senator taken from the upmarket school she attends alongside the son of the Russian President. This happens under the noses of a male and female FBI agent and it's not long before Cross is teaming up with the disgraced woman agent, apparently eager to redeem herself, in bringing the young girl back.Being Patterson of course there are several twists and turns along the way some of which you can see coming and some that you can't but that only because they're pretty implausible in the first place. It all ends with a predictable face-off between Cross and the revealed baddie with everything explained and resolved in time-honoured fashion. Of course you have to suspend disbelief at the fantastical plot jumps presented as the film goes, like Cross unerringly knowing his way around every street in a crowded city centre as the kidnapper has him doing a runaround to deliver the ransom demand, arriving every time right next to a convenient phone for the next instruction, or the kidnapper turning up at Cross's house for it seems a one-to-one psychiatric session which doesn't end well for the patient and most glaringly Cross conveniently conjuring up from almost airy nothing a computer password which divulges the whole background to the nefarious plot. To say nothing of the calmness of the infant victim herself when the kidnapper comes to her presumably for the last time.In short, it's all pretty ludicrous and I can only presume read better than it played on the big screen. The direction is pretty routine for this kind of movie, with only a few reasonably exciting moments, like the original kidnap at the school, a rain-soaked botched second kidnap attempt and a good death for the surprise perpetrator at the climax but otherwise the actors just seem to be moved around on the screen and say their dialogue before we're moved onto the next disconnected instalment. It doesn't help either that composer Jerry Goldsmith's almost omnipresent soundtrack seems to think it's for a Star Trek movie.Freeman is as good as he needs to be in the lead role in what is very obviously a star vehicle for him but even he can't elevate the movie to anything approaching seat-edge excitement although I'd imagine for the no doubt many fans of the book they'd have enjoyed this by-numbers dramatisation of it a bit more than I did.",Along Came a Spider

34,secondtake,"The archetypes, the twists, the filming--everything is standard fare, passably well done, but that's all",5,22 April 2013,"Along Came a Spider (2001)Well, Morgan Freeman is pretty dependable, and he keeps this movie going. Otherwise the use and re-use of tired plot devices and general crime clichés is too much. And some of the acting is pretty marginal, too, making for rough sledding.The essence is a kidnapping with ransom in play, and with the common addition that the criminal wants a particular cop to do the case. (For prestige.) So Freeman takes the case. The actual crime is clever and highly improbable (the criminal needed to be in disguise for 2 years straight before the crime--2 years!). And then the series of twists begins, with people who are not suspects suddenly (very suddenly) in the middle of it all.Of course these things all have their interest, so even as you watch knowing it could be better you're curious who did what and how. It makes sense, too, whatever the unlikelihood. Expect scene after scene to depend on Freeman's steady hand to keep it afloat.Director Lee Tamahori has an up and down career, and he's no stranger to mediocre productions, and so this is right up his alley (""The Devil's Double"" is the more interesting, and the most recent). The most praised by far is the one dealing with his own New Zealand issues, ""Once Were Warriors, so that might be a place to go instead of this.

38,Dr_Coulardeau,A simple but effective entertaining film,9,28 May 2008,"The film is rather simple but it works. And it works not because of the kidnapping of the child. Not because of the pathos that comes along with such a case all the time, every time. Not because of the failed attempt of the girl to escape. Not because of the child's father's over-reacting. It works because the plot is too simple to be accepted like that. A solitary man could not have planned and realized that plot in Washington DC, with the Russian security services looking after the son of the Ambassador and the secret service working there full time in that private school. Too much security in that school for such a kidnapping to have been done by only one person. Then there must have been accomplices and that's how the film works because we do not know who he or she or they is or are and we are looking out for the clues, for the punch line, for the final and supreme plotter. And that's just what it is all about, one plotter double-crossing the other or the others, or even maybe three tiers instead of just two, and maybe even four tiers, and we are double-crossed in a magnificent way just the very same way the profiling cop is double-crossed in a very standard way. The profiler is profiled by the criminal and then side-tracked because when you know the profile of the profiler the profiler becomes predictable and then inefficient, impotent. So that helps to take the medicine down indeed, even if the girl survives only because the criminals did not do one thing right, only one thing, one single and unique thing.

Monica Potter plays his new partner(and she is lovely to boot)and gives a very nice turn in her somewhat complicated role.

41,Anonymous_Maxine,Ten million dollars in diamonds are forever.,7,20 April 2001,"Okay, that didn't really have much to do with this movie, but hey, neither did the first 15 minutes of it. Along Came A Spider is a very entertaining thriller, but as soon as it ends, you realize that it is little more than a rehash of things that have been seen in countless thrillers of the same kind before. There are several effective twists during the movie, but when you think about it, they are exactly the same twists that you see in just about every thriller. The largely recycled plot is somewhat saved by the always excellent performance from Morgan Freeman (I think he's more than redeemed himself by now for Hard Rain), as well as the wonderfully hate-able kidnapper (Gary Soneji) provided by Michael Wincott, who may not have been given a role as fitting as this since Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (keeping in mind his excellent performance in The Crow). Monica Potter plays the role of the Secret Service agent in charge of supervising little Megan, the daughter of a Senator and the subject of the story's kidnapping. It doesn't become abundantly clear until near the end of the film, but Potter sounds EXACTLY like Julia Roberts in this role, despite bearing no physical resemblance whatsoever. Her vocal similarity to Roberts is downright spooky.
One of the things that really brought this movie down was the way that Megan was portrayed as some sort of super girl. I don't expect for her to be just a poor helpless little girl, but just because she is a senator's daughter doesn't mean that she should automatically be able to concoct a brilliant scheme involving exploding batteries in order to escape from her captor, or perform some of the feats that she did while she was held captive in the wooden room during the end of the film. That sort of thing should be reserved for action B-movies like Commando (yes, I know that Commando rocked, but so did Bloodsport and Kickboxer, but that doesn't mean they're not B-movies). You remember that Alyssa Milano, in Commando, was confined to a wooden room in that film, and she escaped by prying a board loose near the floor  EXACTLY the same way that Megan was attempting to escape in Along Came A Spider. Given all of the things that are wrong with this film, it becomes clear that it's value does not lie with the story, but instead with the superior performances throughout. Of particular note, obviously, are Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Freeman is always good in his movies, however bad the plot, and it's just so good to occasionally see an actor like Wincott get a role that fits his iconography so well. Along Came A Spider is not a great movie by any standards, but there can be no denying that it does have its moments. The delivery of the diamond ransom, for example, may not have been too original, but at least it was well done. While it's true that this movie seems to have been assembled from parts taken directly from dozens of other movies, it still manages to barely save itself, although it is still almost sure to be very quickly forgotten.",Along Came a Spider

This is a more more exciting or livelier film, opening with a thrilling start, which shows Alex Cross's reasons for retiring. He's called back in on a special case, involving the kidnapping of a congressman's little daughter (a real smart cookie) at a collegiate school by a nutter (a fantastic Michael Wincott who has a brilliant facade one might say at the start) who really just wants notoriety than money, but there's a bigger picture here. Yeah, I did have issues with the unsatisfying motive of Wincott's, but there's other qualities in this film that make up for it, so all can be forgiven. Assisting Freeman is a young female agent (Monica Potter-No, it's not Julia Roberts) bed sitting the daughter at school, who fails in his task in protecting her, and feels much obliged to help. The twist in this film is a killer, one of the best, I've ever witnessed, the film's title baring a classic connotation to this aspect.

But I was pleasantly surprised to find an entertaining and complex kidnap mystery instead. Contrary to critics, this film holds up very well when compared to its prequel ""Kiss the Girls"" (1997). Morgan Freeman repeats his role as Dr. Alex Cross, a police psychologist who has just lost his partner in the opening scenes. In the meantime a powerful U.S. senator's daughter (Mika Boorem) is kidnaped by a trusted teacher (Michael Wincott) for unknown reasons. The secret service agent responsible for the child (Monica Potter) blames herself for the incident and joins up with Cross, who has been drawn into the case, to help find the young kidnap victim. As the story unfolds, director, Lee Tamahori leads us down a road that contains many plot twists and turns and a few unexpected surprises as well. Freeman as always, gives his usual outstanding performance in the lead role and Boorem is more than adequate as his new partner Jezzie who has a few problems of her own. Wincott is alternately good and evil as the kidnaper, Soneji. Boorem gives a convincing performance as Megan Rose, the child who is kidnaped.

And while his first appearance was in kind of fair thriller, this return is better and more attractive in my point of view.From the first time I rented (Along Came a Spider - 2001) on 27/1/2003, I fell in love with it. The elements are all high and solid. The bright cinematography, (Jerry Goldsmith)'s music, and the fresh performance, certainly we have a case where nothing is glaringly wrong. I enjoyed it, more than once, for its good cinematic work.(Freeman) is more charismatic than ever, doing his share of action as well. (Monica Potter) is a treasure, though got no work in Tinseltown! Maybe she refuses to appear naked for instance; I know that what Hollywood always asks nowadays! (Michael Wincott) made one of his most remarkable roles to date, being on the edge between a disturbed criminal and a wronged genius; I believed his sane performance so much. However, the one that I savored the most was that director.(Lee Tamahori), who came from New Zealand few years earlier, made deservingly a discrete name. I adore his work utterly. He can lead such a fascinating action all the way, with an unusual professional technique. He got lovely aesthetic feel, can formulate the simplest details as stately, and most of all; he doesn't show off. He's capable of recreating a plain thriller as something so cohesive, engaging, and memorable, without hyped anything. In one word, he's the old-fashioned school at its best. I always recall the sequence in which (Freeman) was running all over the streets of Washington D.C, or surely the one with the two leads having a tough moment under the rain in front of the Russian embassy; this is a magical moment of cinema. No wonder that shortly after this movie, he would be selected to make the next James Bond's movie (Die Another Day - 2002) which I consider as a big masterpiece for both (Tamahori) and Bond.Although, this is the 100 minutes type of ride, but there are some interesting points: the smart riddles that the kidnapper used with the police, the screenplay's twists, and the good dialogue. Just try to remember another thrillers where you hear lines like ""We do what we are"", they are few, very few. Since I was a kid, I loved reading the suspenseful novels, respecting just the strong ones, so by loving this movie, I do what I am indeed!Name one bad thing about it? Hmmm.. well, maybe one discovering for some information near the end was too easy to a little bit fabricated extent, the movie's title which's identical with another TV thriller from the 1970s that I see as lower, and finally the way people look at it as a ""small"" flick; while it's fine, with no CGI nonsense, and still a pretty good way to spend an afternoon.P.S: (Monica Potter) doesn't look anything like (Monica Potter) on the poster!",Along Came a Spider

This is film is not as good as Kiss the Girls, and is not as dark, but it does fill a spot and is decent viewing.The basic plot of the film is Alex Cross is called out of retirement after a Senator's young daughter is kidnapped from her school under the noses of the Secret Service. The kidnapper picks Cross to be the main negotiator because he is damaged: he is suffering from grief and guilt after the death of his partner.The film is not the most well written, with some of the plot twists a bit unbelievable: but it does offer some gems like general politics and the politics within the Secret Service, the kidnap itself (the first 30 minutes are the best) and the general psychology of the characters. There is some good acting, Morgan Freeman can never give a bad performance, even in bad film. I thought the young actress playing Megan Rose (the kidnap victim), Mika Boorem, was very good and has promise, but I felt that the filmmakers could have shown more and play up the impact of being kidnapped. Michael Wincott and Monica Potter also offered decent performances. Lee Tamahori, the director, was really just a gun-for-hire director, but he still did solid job. He wasn't terrible but not spectacular. This was his last decent film because he ended up directing Die Another Day, XXX2: State of the Union and NextDecent enough film if it is on television.",Along Came a Spider
46,alindsay-al,A below average thriller,4,13 October 2015,"There are many top quality thrillers over the years but I'm afraid to say this film Is not one of them. The premise of the film sees a retired detective drawn back into his work when a congressman's daughter is kidnapped. Morgan freeman is easily the best part of this film which isn't really a surprise. He was great in the lead role and he really delivered in this private detective role that suited him very well. The villain was pretty good in this film even though you don't really know too much about him or about his motivations. However, I didn't really like the partner that freeman gets. It's just she didn't really have anything special about her character for the majority of the film. The story is very generic with similarities to allot of other films but it has a bit of suspense to it. That is until the 3/4 mark where there are a few twists that really spoil the overall plot of the film. The script doesn't provide the suspense or drama that you want, it also moves really quickly so you sometimes miss key dialogue. The style had some decent action scenes and a bit of good suspense. But once again there isn't anything that stands out and makes this film feel truly unique. Overall, this is a below average film that you can avoid.",Along Came a Spider

49,iquine,Moderately Satisfying Meal of a Thriller,8,6 December 2019,"(Flash Review)This movie amply satiates an appetite for a worthwhile detective investigation movie. While zero creative boundaries are pushed, it also had very few questionable eye rolling moments that often riddle many movies in the genre. This is a straight forward detective, kidnapping caper that has a few medium surprises in store. The story kicks off with a girl being kidnapped from a private school, with active security on-hand as she is the daughter of a Senator. Surprise, Surprise. And yep, the kidnapper requests a crafty old veteran detective (Freeman) to challenge him to track him down. That's never been done before. He is forced to team up with a younger female detective who is a key character in the movie. Despite some cookie-cutter plot devices, the kidnapped girl actually makes intelligent choices and genuine attempts to escape and there is solid tension with just enough twists to be rewarding and not too many to devalue the story. Freeman's character is a carbon copy of his detective character in SE7EN. Totally worth the time but don't expect anything fresh.",Along Came a Spider

The film is aimed at viewers who like crime puzzles and mind games. There's lots of action and dark suspense.The film's underlying concept is fascinating and clever. But the screenplay overlays the ingenious concept with implausible, and at times confusing, plot twists. After my second viewing I still had unanswered questions.The screenplay had another weakness. At least seven times, it used TV news coverage of the abduction to advance the plot. Relying on TV news reporting is a stale and tiresome plot device that detracts from any film, in my opinion. Here, its repetitiveness made it even more irritating.The film's characters were not particularly interesting. Freeman's Alex Cross was dull and plodding; Potter's Jezzie Flannigan was nasal and humorless. And the melodramatic music was manipulative and too loud.""Along Came A Spider"" does have entertainment value, derived from its suspenseful action, and cloak and dagger intrigue, enhanced by excellent cinematography and good set design.

Along Came A Spider is a thrilling, exciting psychological Thriller drenched in that Awesome 90's Thriller Movie Feel from the lovely rich cinematography to the exciting & thrilling music score by legendary composer JERRY GOLDSMITH, this is a cracking good Cop film & Morgan Freeman is great again as the super smart veteran Detective but this time he's more troubled after the devastating death of his partner seen at the beginning of the film that he just couldn't save in time, his Alex Cross feels more tormented & vulnerable here & Freeman is just great on screen as usual & is best when playing a Detective like he did in Seven & Kiss the Girls.
The rest of the cast are all fine in their roles like Michael Wincott as the criminal villain with an icey-cold presence & the secret service agent who teams up with Alex Cross played by Monica Potter who may hide a dark secret, it's all a slick & well made Thriller & a great late night flick.
""Spider"" is just as good as ""Girls"" but both films are excellent Suspense Thriller's & equally enjoyable but i think i enjoy ""Spider"" more for it's rainy moody atmosphere & relaxed pacing, i enjoy the quiet moments of Alex Cross just investigating & looking at evidence.
I love this film & can say it's my favourite Morgan Freeman film.
I got the same nice, cozy & almost comforting feel as i got from other Thrillers such as Kiss The Girls, Murder At 1600, Metro, The Bone Collector & Striking Distance, among others.

There was one person that really gave me the creeps, and that was Mr. Soneji (Michael Wincott). When I saw people get murdered, I was scared. I didn't scream, though.

Sure, the action was fairly well paced and their proved to be plenty of intrigue, the ending just felt a little out of place, like it was randomly added in. Nonetheless, the film was pretty solid.

57,philip_vanderveken,Far from original but worth watching thanks to Morgan Freeman,7,19 May 2005,"Morgan Freeman is an actor that seems to able to pick out the very best scripts Hollywood has to offer. Think of movies like for instance ""Se7en"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Million Dollar Baby"". These are all movies that are without any doubt excellent. But I guess the man has to pay a lot of bills too and that's why he sometimes acts in lesser movies, like for instance this one. But even then his performance still makes it worth to watch it.""Along Came a Spider"" starts with a terrible car accident, eight months before the actual story begins, which police detective and forensic psychologist Alex Cross survives, but that costs his partner's life. He never really recovers from that loss, but when the daughter from a senator is kidnapped from a school by one of the teachers, he tries to help to find the girl. However, when he digs deeper into the case, he uncovers that there is a lot more going on than what they initially thought and not everything is exactly like it seemed in the beginning...Once you've seen the movie, you realize that you haven't seen much new or original. It feels like it all has been done a couple of times before in so many other thrillers. The many obvious twists, the characters that you'll find in almost any thriller,... it really doesn't give you the feeling that you have been watching something special. But what bothered me most was perhaps the story on itself. Of course the little girl is a brilliant student with some famous and rich parents. And of course there can be no doubt about the fact that she is a lot smarter than this 'average' criminal who has kidnapped her and who is holding her captive... And yet, this isn't the worst movie in the genre. Mainly thanks to the performances of Morgan Freeman and Monica Potter, this movie is above average, without being great or even really good. If you don't mind watching an unoriginal thriller or when you are interested in every movie Morgan Freeman has ever played in, than you should give it a try, otherwise you better stay with movies like ""Se7en"".

As bad as I think this movie is, and I think it's horrible, there is no denying that Morgan Freeman flies above it all.

Why didn't she just tell the guy to pull over and she would blow his brains out? No pun intended. Instead the car flies off a precipice of gargantuan dimensions. Kind of reminded me of the over-kill in the scene from The Naked Gun where the guy falls and then is run over by a steam roller and then a full marching band. That time it was funny; this time it was really stupid.But wait, it gets even worse in the next scene. Mr. Soneji works as a teacher for two years to pull off his crime? Makes about zero sense. What if the kid transfers to a new school or gets kicked out for turning tricks? Happens all the time in rich kid academies. He fakes a Brit accent for two years? The female agent kicks in what looks to be a really solid door. Have you ever tried that? Almost impossible. The agents run out on to a busy street and just point their weapons randomly?

64,seymourblack-1,"Action, Excitement & Surprising Twists",8,12 August 2016,"When a movie begins with the level of action, excitement and pace that this one does, it's obvious that the emphasis is on entertainment and so it's no surprise that this gripping psychological thriller turned out to be a real crowd-pleaser that did great business at the box office. What's not so obvious is that the story that follows is intriguing, suspenseful and brilliantly twisted. Based on James Patterson's first novel that featured Washington D.C. police detective Alex Cross, it provided Morgan Freeman with his second outing as the forensic psychologist whose skill at profiling criminals is universally respected. Interestingly, his first appearance as Cross was in ""Kiss The Girls"" (1997) which was based on the second novel in the series.Life at an exclusive private school in Washington D.C. is thrown into turmoil when the daughter of a U.S. Senator is abducted by her computer science teacher who also kills one of his colleagues before taking Megan Rose (Mika Boorem) to his houseboat. Gary Soneji (Michael Wincott) changes his appearance immediately by removing the disguise that he'd worn during his two years at the school and telephones Dr Alex Cross who he instructs to check his mailbox. On finding, what proves to be one of Megan's shoes, Cross is convinced that he's been contacted by the real kidnapper.Cross had suffered a period of depression and retired from his job following the death of his partner in a sting operation that had gone horribly wrong but reluctantly now finds himself drawn into this case because he's been personally contacted by the kidnapper. Under-pressure FBI Agent Ollie McArthur (Dylan Baker) is in charge of the investigation and undiplomatically refers to Cross as ""damaged"" as well as being equally scathing in his attitude to Secret Service Agent Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) who'd been in charge of security at the school when Megan was abducted. Despite initially being unenthusiastic about involving them in the investigation, McArthur agrees that Cross and Flannigan could both be useful to have on board and so they team up to try to hunt down Soneji and rescue Megan.It gradually becomes apparent to Dr Cross that Soneji's motive in contacting him had been to elevate his own status by having an adversary of the highest calibre so that by outwitting him, he could assert his own superiority and prove his brilliance as a criminal mastermind. Unusually, this psychopathic killer was not motivated by greed but instead wanted to achieve fame for having committed one of the crimes of the century, in the same way that Bruno Richard Hauptmann had after his conviction for the 1932 kidnapping of Charles Lindberg Jr. Dr Cross has to think again however, when he realises that there's more to Soneji's criminal agenda than simply kidnapping Megan.Director Lee Tamahori does a terrific job on this movie by injecting it with great pace and tension at various junctures as well as choreographing the action sequences so effectively. It's also rich in atmosphere and the cinematography is exceptional. The quality of the acting is generally good throughout with Morgan Freeman outstanding in a role which fits his style perfectly. Its most memorable qualities though, are its genuinely surprising plot twists and its straight-forward ability to entertain so successfully.",Along Came a Spider
65,Spuzzlightyear,Along came a... Oops.,6,14 April 2006,"Along Came a Spider is one of those movies that appear to be great at first once you finish it. But as you think about it, the plot holes start to appear. The MORE you think about it, the bigger the holes become.Morgan Freeman stars again as detective Alex Cross, a recently retired detective who is forced to get back into action when a kidnapper (played quite excellently actually by an actor I've never heard before, Michael Wincott) goads him into going after him and the kidnapped Senator's daughter he's holding. He's soon joined by the guardian (Monica Potter) of the Senator's daughter. As Cross tries to unravel the case, mistakes are made by the kidnappers, and soon, someone takes advantage of the kidnapper's errors..While the acting is strong, the story is somewhat wobbly. The ending is totally ridiculous as the surprise seems to be a tad desperate and doesn't really resolve anything but to add a lot more questions then answers.

69,The_Movie_Cat,"""Transparent and it's clumsy.""",5,2 September 2001,"Along Came A Spider is a load of hoary old dick clichés strung around glaring plot improbabilities into something remotely resembling a story.What really galls about the movie is that it sets itself up as a middlebrow psychological kidnap hunt (You know, the sort where the lone cop tries to keep the man talking on the end of the line where he traces the call? The sort of film you feel you've already seen at least twenty-seven times in the last year?) yet never gets out of gear. It brags and postures over its own believed intellectualism, yet we find out nothing that's even remotely deep-felt throughout the entire duration. Instead lots of second-rate actors trudge through a fifth-rate script trying to look vaguely interested.Morgan Freeman, the one decent actor in the piece, struggles gamely to keep awake as all around him descends into formula. You can almost hear him thinking ""this was so much better when we did it in Se7en."" Yet Se7en had Caucasian pretty boy Brad Pitt, and so the aged black Freeman finds himself with a lacklustre script merely due to the fact he's not Hollywood's preferred ""type"". As a sequel to the superior  yet still run-of-the-mill  Kiss The Girls, it's too gimmicky and lacks the cinematic genius to stage its final confrontation to the sound of Little Richard singing ""Goodnight Irene"". The only element that holds any kind of interest is the twist ending, but it's one that's as ludicrous as the rest of the underdeveloped film. For a surprise twist Morgan could've pulled a bunch of pineapples out of his back passage, mooned at the camera and joined the rest of the cast in a rousing rendition of Boney M's ""Ra Ra Rasputin."" Just because something is unexpected does not mean it's any good, or even plausible. A twist ending does not just equal something you didn't expect, but something that should arise logically out of the plot. In fairness, I should have seen it coming anyway. I guess sleep had set in by that point.The really worrying thing is that the makers of this tired by the numbers ""thriller"" (Is the film in violation of the Trades Descriptions Act?) seem to think audiences will be too stupid to realise what a lame movie this is.

The thing is that Patterson did not even try. This movie along with Kiss the Girls seems to be an appetizer for his made for television work. They have none of the ferocity that makes Alex Cross an interesting character to behold. I imagined Denzel Washington as Alex Cross and Angelina Jolie as Jezzie Flanagan. At the time three years before the two would pair successfully in The Bone Collector. Morgan Freeman is too old to play Alex Cross. All of this casting talk is secondary. If the makers had not deviated from the book, it would have been better with the cast it has.

Technically you can watch this film without ever having seen Kiss the Girls since apart from Freeman's character the story and it's characters are all new. The problem however is Freeman's character Alex Cross isn't given any real introduction in this film so if you haven't already seen the previous film his character can easily come across as poorly written and underdeveloped. There are several scene's in the film that hint at Cross's past but again if you haven't seen the previous film then your likely to feel a little lost.The film itself is overplotted and a little underwhelming. There's nothing here that hasn't already been done before in other films. Morgan Freeman gives a great performance but other than that there is nothing of any worth in this very hollow and generic Drama/Thriller.,Along Came a Spider
76,Movie-12,"Nice moments and effective twists, but too many plot holes. ** (out of four)",5,20 April 2001,"ALONG CAME A SPIDER / (2001) ** (out of four)By Blake French:	In 1997, a big year for serial killer movies, Gary Fleder's ""Kiss the Girls"" enriched the genre with a sense of splendid atmosphere, mystery and intrigue. ""Along Came a Spider,"" based on a novel by James Patterson, is not on that level. It is not really a sequel, but more a continuation of the adventures of Forensic Psychologist Alex Cross. It is a well-made movie with good performances and effective, unexpected plot twists and startling surprises, but so much of it is too conventional. As I watched the film, often spotting ample plot holes, I was astonished at how recycled so many of the scenes were. There is a sequence that has Cross running throughout a busy city during rush hour to deliver a ransom. The killer commands him to race from one location to the next answering pay phones. Gee, we have never seen this idea before.	Morgan Freeman reprises his role as Alex Cross who finds himself in complete grief and remorse after losing a partner during an undercover operation that we see at the beginning of the film. It starts out quick as his time of regret is shattered when he gets a phone call from a killer who just kidnapped the 12 year old daughter of the Senator (Michael Moriarty). We know this man as a school teacher named Mr. Soneji (Michael Wincott). Although under the secret service protection by Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter) and Ben Devine (Billy Burke), Soneji devised an articulate plan and now holds the girl captive on his boat.	I dare not reveal any more of the story. There are several ninety degree twists that play games with our mind. However, they are disposable and essentially unneeded, and only rationalize familiar clichés. Some of them are fun, but they seem to crawl out of holes in the plot. As the movie continues, it only becomes more absurd. And it is particularly vulnerable to logic, or perhaps it is just poorly edited. For instance, what if the detectives missed any of the killer's clues? Any given clue? Then what? His entire plan would be shot to hell because each clue he leaves sets the police up for the next one. So I question: why do killers always want to play elaborate cat and mouse games with detectives?Unlike ""Kiss the Girls,"" ""Along Came a Spider"" lacks suspense and thrills because there is little tension in its structure. We already know the killer's identity-but do we? The movie certainly ends up on different floors than where I thought it would land, and it works to some extent. I still think the movie could have had some more thrilling moments of suspense and chills instead of indulging in a crime case that is not really all that involving. Actually, we never really care if the killer is caught. Since the film's villain is so much more interesting than the good guys, I was actually rooting for him in some scenes. When the girl tries to escape from Soneji, I was hoping she would be caught, because I wanted Soneji to lay down more puzzle pieces for Cross. 	There are nice moments here, effective scenes of action. Morgan Freeman is a little too calm and collected for such an intense situation, though. Monica Porter has a great performance, however, in one of the film's trickiest roles. ""Along Came a Spider,"" directed by Lee Tamahori (""The Edge,"" ""Mulholland Falls"") has a lot of potential-but strays from its roots and becomes just another contrived thriller in which we have already seen countless times before.",Along Came a Spider

I can only hope that there's not another sequel, and that Morgan starts taking some roles that don't shoe-horn him into such stereotypical territory.With Monica Potter as the replacement for Ashley Judd, Along Came A Spider is probable less sequel-esque than many we've had in recent years.  Of course she isn't a patch on Judd, but she does well enough to erase the memories of some of the utter tripe she's made in recent years.There's a twist in the tale that I didn't see coming [makes a change for Hollywood films!] but I still got the impression that the ending was rather contrived and put together so that everything was tidied up nicely for the audience.Did this get a re-take after a test screening that didn't go down well?

It was certainly much better than the disappointing ""Kiss the Girls"" movie - a movie which was pretty predictable, but what makes ""Along came a Spider"" stand-out are its twists and turns. The movie is some mystery no doubt, and is certainly worth watching.The story is about a forensic psychologist named Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) who retires after a disastrous sting operation that resulted in the death of his partner. He immediately retires after that tragedy, but later, he is pretty much drawn back to the police force again after a congressman daughter named Megan Ross (Mika Boorem) is kidnapped at school by a 'teacher'. This kidnapper then drags Alex (Morgan) into this by placing the shoe of the girl in his mailbox. Then, Alex (Morgan) along with Jezzie Flannigan (Monica Potter), presumably Alex's (Morgan) new partner must find out where Megan Rose (Mika) is and everything else afterwards.Like I've said, it's a good movie with lots of twist and turns, and that was one of the major reasons I enjoyed this movie.

82,Rickting,Super generic and forgettable,5,12 October 2014,"I read the book this is based on shortly before watching this and thoroughly enjoyed it so I was interested to see the film. Like the book, this is about detective Alex Cross investigating a child abduction. As much as I love Morgan Freeman he's not my choice for Alex Cross and he's miscast in this OK but totally average thriller. Looking at the film from an objective point of view, this is an OK film technically but when compared to the book, it lacks the depth, twists and thrills which made the book such a non stop nightmare. Morgan Freeman is less interesting than usual and miscast and the film is in general just forgettable. To be fair, you can't really expect much from the person who did Die Another Day and if you haven't read the book you'll likely find this watchable and moderately entertaining. It's got plenty of tense moments and is more patient and mature than some films of its kind. The visuals are decent as is the script (despite a multitude of plot holes) and the film never becomes unwatchable.The main problem is that it's so generic and wasteful of the source material. It goes down the road into cliché town with great enthusiasm and never really hits a peak. It can be dull and it has quite a few implausible situations. The revelation of Jessie Flanagan as the antagonist made sense in the book, but it doesn't here. The film is also derivative of better things and doesn't add anything whatsoever to the detective genre. There is apparently another Morgan Freeman film, which adapts the slightly inferior but still good sequel Kiss The Girls. That is apparently even more unfaithful so I don't plan to watch it. How bearable you find the film pretty much depends on whether or not you've read the book. It lacks charisma or soul, but makes up for it since it has a certain sense of dread, tension and realism. An OK movie. Nothing more. Nothing less.5/10",Along Came a Spider

84,richieandsam,A good movie... but could have been better.,7,20 May 2013,"ALONG CAME A SPIDERThis is a typical thriller. It is a good movie and I really enjoyed it, but it is nothing that is new really. Everything you see in this film has been done before in other thrillers.There are some predictable moments and some twists that I didn't see coming, which makes for a good thriller. You don't want the whole film to be predictable. I like the element of surprise in films and this one had a couple of moments that surprised me.The movie is about a detective who is looking for a kidnapped child of a senator. The problem is this kidnapper has a grudge with the detective.The movie star Morgan Freeman and Monica Potter. Morgan does a good job I think Morgan is a very good actor, but a lot of the characters he plays are the same. I still think his best film was Se7en.Monica also did a great job she was very convincing in her character and you feel sorry for her through the movie as it was her character that was supposed to be protecting the kidnapped girl.My favourite character was the bad guy though, played by Michael Wincott. He was very convincing and had a great face and personality in the film that made the part more convincing I believed he was crazy.The story played along at a good pace too there were no boring moments and I didn't get bored at all through the movie,It ran for over 90 minutes, but it felt less than that and that is generally a sign of a good movie. Time does fly when you are having fun.The main negative thing I could say about this film was the makeup the kidnapper was wearing prosthetics at the beginning of the movie and pretended to be someone in a group of people but the prosthetics were so bad, as soon as I saw him I said to my wife ""He is wearing a mask it is so obvious"" I thought they could have made the mask more convincing. But then this film was made in 2001. Perhaps they make up was not as good back then.This was a very entertaining movie and a lot of fun but unfortunately there was nothing really original there.I will give this film 7 out of 10.I just hoped there would be some twists in it that I had never seen before.For more reviews, please check out my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Along Came a Spider

86,chrisbrown6453,Oh Morgan,5,5 July 2001,"I've always liked Morgan Freeman. While I've never thought that he was one of the great actors of our time, he could always make a bad film better. And let's face it, Morgan Freeman has made a lot of crummy movies. In fact lately, that's all he's been making.I wasn't expecting much from Along Came a Spider. I don't particularly remember liking Kiss the Girls that much. I mostly remember that Alex Cross was a leather coat wearing, sport car driving, earring sporting detective that looked more like he should be pimpin' girls than busting the bad guys. But again, he was the best part of an otherwise dismal movie. I think I see a pattern here.Along Came a Spider is more of the same. Alex Cross is a cool, collected character that never seems to get antsy even when the stakes are high. He's also the main character in yet another movie that isn't as good as he is. There are plot discrepancies that are so big that I could drive that cool Porche through.  I really feel badly for Monica Potter.  She's certainly a likable actress in her own right, even if she was in Patch Adams. And I actually liked her in Head Over Heals. It's certainly a sad, sad state of affairs when you make two movies in one year and the better one has Freddie Prinze Jr. in a starring role. Ouch.Even as blah as Along Came a Spider was, with it's retarded characters and plot twists that can be seen coming a mile away, I still wouldn't mind seeing Morgan Freeman play Alex Cross again. Sure, this was a messed up movie and Kiss the Girls wasn't any better. But I can't help but feel that one of these times Hollywood is going to get one of these movies right. I don't know why. If anyone should know better, it's me. Maybe I'm just stupid. But I'm sure that's not the case.",Along Came a Spider

89,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Well done movie,5,17 June 2008,"After an obligatory prologue in which its detective hero suffers a tragic professional setback, Along Came a Spider sets about its business of luring the viewer into its nefarious plot, relying on the magician's technique of misdirection to reveal a double-whammy surprise. The clever, late-coming plot twist is a bit too mechanical but effectively unexpected, making this a satisfying prequel to the hit thriller Kiss the Girls--based on the first of James Patterson's Alex Cross detective novels--and a welcomed addition to a promising movie franchise. It's no better or worse than a good vintage episode of Peter Falk's Columbo, adhering closely to the mystery-thriller's time-honored traditions, but with Morgan Freeman settling comfortably into his role as seasoned sleuth Alex Cross, familiar formula is given fresh vitality. When a senator's daughter is kidnapped from her high-security private school, the kidnapper (nicely played by the underrated Michael Wincott) draws Cross into the case, knowing that the psychologist-detective's involvement will bring high-profile publicity. Cross partners with the Secret Service agent (Monica Potter) who botched her assignment, but wait... the movie's got a rabbit in its hat... and that rabbit has an ace up its sleeve... and director Lee Tamahori (who brought similar intensity to The Edge) handles the sleight-of-hand with slick precision, dispensing just enough information to keep the viewer off guard without resorting to cheap manipulation. Don't look for much depth of character here, but Along Came a Spider is well served by everyone involved. It's the movie equivalent of a bestseller you'd impulsively buy at the grocery-store checkout, and on those terms it succeeds.",Along Came a Spider

This movie lacked coherence and was full of plot holes.  Morgan Freeman was, as usual, good but was saddled with a poor script.  The rest of the cast were forgettable two dimensional caricatures.  Typically situations were resolved by blowing big bloody holes in people with the ever present guns. The only real suspense was how and when the bad guys were going to be shot.

I don't think Secret Service folks are typically whiny and lacking in self-confidence.The writing was terrible.  Some of the dialogue was laugh-out-loud funny. The kidnapper wanted SI2 diamonds.  SI2 are pretty crummy consumer-grade diamond.  OK, maybe he just doesn't know his diamonds.  They don't know their computers either.  When they find a webcam to the kidnappers house, why don't they just dump the arp tables and get the TCP/IP address. HELLO! These are Secret Service.  I think they know this stuff.I have tremendous respect for Morgan Freeman's acting ability, but I don't always like his choice of film projects.

A real ""What was the point of that?"" film, which takes some believing, but despite all that it does have plenty of tension even if you know exactly how it will pan out.

96,monkeysgalore,"As Good as the First, For Better or Worse",7,8 February 2020,"I enjoyed Morgan Freeman's ""Alex Cross"" films. As a thriller fan, I found both to be entertaining, interesting, and well-written (for the most part). Both were pretty standard thrillers though, and the only thing that really set them apart from other films in the genre was the presence of Morgan Freeman. He has to be one of the greatest actors out there, and I'd definitely take him over a lot of the more celebrated actors.I read the novel this film was based on (written by James Patterson in 1993), and it was quite good. I can't really get into the differences between the book and film without giving away plot points, but essentially, things in the book were changed for the film, which for me, made the film less spectacular. The book's plot played out for over a year, while the film's plot didn't take very long to wrap up. Rushing the plot by cramming it into a small time window for a movie isn't usually the best idea, as much is lost in translation. Here, things aren't allowed to play out as they did in the book, and the shortened time-frame removed layers of complexity that made the book so fascinating. The movie is still good, just not on the level of the book.I've seen several of Lee Tamahori's other films, enough to be familiar with his particular directorial style, which is essentially large, overblown action set-pieces which are often comprised of rather cheap-looking special effects. That said, he managed to solidly direct this film, without letting his style creep in and mess with the atmosphere, with the exception of the terrible CGI car crash in the beginning. For that I applaud him, and I definitely look forward to more of his films.Morgan Freeman is a good Alex Cross I thought, even if he is looking a little old in this film. I saw the films before reading the books, so I couldn't help but picture Freeman while reading, which is probably why many people would disagree with me. He had physicality, he was charismatic, calm, and collected, and he really elevated the movie. All the other actors were fine, though not as good as Freeman.This film's plot was slightly less interesting to me than the previous film, but this film didn't dwell on psychological and sexual terror as much as the last one did, so I was able to enjoy this one more.This, much like the first, is a pretty violent movie, though not quite as sadistic as the first. It's sill bloody though, and there's a violent car crash in the beginning, a street shootout, a violent apartment scene, and the climax, with bits of violence peppered in between. The violence is graphic, so just note that.Overall, I marginally recommend it to Morgan Freeman and thriller fans alike. It's not overwrought or overly-complicated, and it's easy to follow. Check it out.",Along Came a Spider
97,ivko,a school seriously in need of better hiring standards,6,13 October 2020,"A US senator's daughter is kidnapped from an upper crust school that caters to the rich and powerful. The kidnapper, a teacher at the school, executes a clever plan to sneak the student past the swarms of armed security and checkpoints, then begins a twisted game of cat and mouse with a detective (Morgan Freeman) with whom he has a fascination, contacting him directly to draw him into the case. The detective teams up with one of the secret service agents (Monica Potter) who worked at the school to try and solve the clues the kidnapper left behind and retrieve the little girl.While it's not completely awful, this movie struggles at times. The problem is that the movie wants several ""twists"", surprise reveals ala Sixth Sense, and to get them it has characters behave in ways that strain suspension of disbelief. I can't talk directly about the twists without ruining major plot points, but suffice to say it seems doubtful that the characters could have the motivations they supposedly have without raising some kind of red flag well before the events of the film start.Once you get past that the movie is a pretty standard crime drama, with the good guys hunting down the bad guys and engaging in big exciting gun battles and car chases until the movie arrives at its predictable outcome. Better movies that Freeman has been in actually manage to surprise in a meaningful way by concluding the story in ways that are genuinely unexpected and have consequences that stay with you after the movie ends. Not that every movie can or should end like Se7en, but a surprise in a film that has little actual impact other than to simply slide characters into new roles within a standard story framework has no long term impact because nothing new has actually happened; the players change but the game is the same.In any case, the movie isn't terrible, it just isn't anything special. It's the kind of movie you watch on Netflix or whatever some rainy day when there's nothing else better to do and is a mildly entertaining diversion.

This is a shame because the movie centres on the relationship between Freeman and Potter's characters and as a result fails to convince.This could have been a good movie with better actors but in the end it's just OK.

The story is not that exciting, and the characters often do things which seem to be, well, just out of character.The surprise ending came as a total surprise, it was not hinted at anywhere during the movie and therefore it is not really a good ending - twisting the plot just for the element of surprise is a rather rude method to get the viewer off-balance, and it has been done better lately in movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Wild Things"". Apart from these big downlets in the style division, there are some major questions remaining as to the main plot.My main complaint, ATTENTION SPOILER ALERT...ALERTWhen the kidnapper wanted to be famous, and when the only way of reaching this fame was to get the Russian presidents son, then why for heavens sake didn't he kidnap him INSTEAD of Megan in the first place? He could just as well have Dimitri called to his office instead of Megan - he would have pulled of his caper without the necessity to bring himself into danger once more at the Russian embassy...No, this movie was certainly not a memorable one.

Here he turns in a well-paced and gripping thriller laced with drama and intrigue.Freeman is excellent as Cross (again) and the supporting cast perform admirably. Michael Wincott delivers a nicely-judged turn as the egocentric and murderous villain of the piece and the twist is well-executed, if perhaps a little predictable in the scheme of things. My personal preference would be for the earlier entry KISS THE GIRLS, but this comes very close to the same standard.

Morgan Freeman has done better things in his hugely successful career, but performs to his usual high standard.Monica Potter is a glamorous woman, her beauty taking precedence over her strong character portrayal. She seems a quiet lady, but Jezzie Flanagan's personality might be misleading, and could hide an angry and deeply hurt conscience, while the revengeful side to Michael Wincott works exceedingly well, such was his performance in the film Metro, and he convinces thoroughly.A thriller like Along Came A Spider does its best to keep the viewer interested, with tautly directed scenes and strong acting. Even so, this movie is not the best ever made, and may leave you wondering what the point was in making it in the first place.If you do watch Along Came A Spider, stick with it and enjoy what it offers - I certainly did. 7/10",Along Came a Spider

I must admit that I think the first one is better, although none of them is really really good. It is just one of those movies that you watch, and then 10 minutes later you have forgotten about it. This is just your typical suspense thriller. Something happens and the smart man, Alex Cross has to figure out who did it and why. The story in this movie is bizarre to say the least, and not believable at all if you ask me. But if you can see past that, it is possible to enjoy this movie, to a certain degree. If you have read my other reviews you know that I never talk too much about the movie, because I think that ruins the experience for some people. So in this movie you will see Morgan Freeman doing his usual role as a incredible smart person, trying to solve a crime. I rate this movie 5/10",Along Came a Spider

107,marydm-43470,Freeman and Wincott are stellar,10,8 July 2021,"What whingeing killjoys some critics are! If a movie has minimal plot it's not got enough. If the plot has a lot of twists it has too many. As if cinema is all about the plot.Plot was the most important element in Charles Dickens and Co, when those monster novels were serialised in the newspapers and plot cliffhangers were the thing that kept people buying the papers.Cinema is a complex multi-modal medium, and plot is only one element among a plethora of elements that need to work together for a movie to be successful (the great Akira Kurosawa made this point pointedly and repeatedly).Even so, the plot twists in this movie are by no means excessive or superfluous, indeed the final one is key to the narrative and dramatic cohesion, regarding Freeman's character and his relationship to working ""partners"". This motif bookends the whole movie brilliantly, won't say more cos I don't do spoilers.The visuals are superb, the cinematography and darkness of most scenes an apt visual metaphor for the dark characters and dark deeds at the core of the story. It's brilliantly moody, and combined with some pretty intelligent dialogue it gives the movie a noir atmosphere.Editing and pacing are excellent. But the the two central characters alone make for mesmerising viewing. Freeman is his usually superlative authoritative screen presence, but the real surprise is Michael Wincott. He creates a dark twisted character right up there with the best the great Dennis Hopper has managed to do. I'm thinking Blue Velvet.I remember Wincott in Alien 4, possibly the single best performance in that troubled movie.Great film, enjoyable and intelligent, with two central stellar performances.",Along Came a Spider

109,RolloTomasi,disappointing,3,8 April 2001,"Most definitely CONTAINS SPOILERS. It kicks off with a bang. Unfortunately, this opening scene quickly destroyed my respect for the film and cashed in the only suspension-of-disbelief chip it held only minutes in. Someone as intelligent as Morgan Freeman's Alex Cross is supposed to be should have been able to come up with a better plan than this to trap a serial rapist. How in the world did he expect anyone to protect her while he's driving the car? The suspect has too much control in the situation. True, Cross kicks himself for it later, but I don't find it realistic that he would have put his partner's life at that much risk in the first place. ""Spider"" isn' t awful. But for a thriller, I found it to be less than engaging. Too bad because it's a good story. Secret Service agents outsmarting a criminal mastermind and turning it into an opportunity for themselves is a great concept. Now I'd like to read the novel. It's surely better.Tamahori and writer Marc Moss' execution of it is decent. No one's going to see that last big twist coming. You know something is off the whole time, just by the way Soneji is painted. The character is such a wreck, I'd have been disappointed if it HAD actually been him behind everything. One thing is guaranteed in a thriller like this: There's always someone bigger waiting in the shadows. So Moss wisely chooses not to even try fooling us into thinking otherwise. The problem is that he keeps you guessing for too long. There is that whole sequence immediately following Soneji's failed attempt at kidnapping Dmitri, where nothing that happens makes any sense. This includes Cross' silly run through downtown D.C. (though at his age, you have to admire how nimble Freeman is).  He's asking himself why Soneji is just now asking for money, and so are we, especially seeing as we know Soneji doesn't have Megan any more. I think it would have helped if the audience didn't know the girl was gone at that point. Maybe show him returning to the boat and finding her gone after the train scene (but still do the scene right after the stakeout where he returns to the boat, only cut before showing Megan's compartment empty). That would have made it look like Soneji was simply becoming more desperate, having not scored his primary target. Hmmm.Placing Monica Potter in the rogue agent role was either a stroke of genius or a big miscast, I can't decide which. Just being who she is draws away all suspicion. Seeing her blow a guy's brains out was pretty freaky. It was like watching in an innocent child waving a gun around, not knowing the damage it can do. If this is the unsettling effect they were looking for, well, mission accomplished. Even so, something's off and it's this: why make her a complete lunatic? It's too much of a leap in too short a time span.  Changes like this in characters need to be more gradual. Her wanting to kill Megan goes too far and is a plot flaw anyway (thanks T). She's got the money, why not just let the kid go? Heck, she could even continue being an agent if she wanted to. Jezzie's sudden change in demeanor is designed to create a more rousing ending to the film, but it doesn't make sense.For a much more intense, truly entertaining kidnap-themed film, try ""Ransom"" if you haven't seen it. I'm disappointed in Tamahori, who after making the great, David Mamet-penned ""The Edge"", raised himself to a pretty high standard. Despite the mess ""Spider"" is, I hope Freeman takes the Alex Cross character for another spin. The man deserves a successful franchise.

110,MRavenwood,Worth Watching and Good Suspense Film for 16+,7,14 December 2007,"It's pretty hard to screw up a Morgan Freeman vehicle, so there's low risk going in. The weak link is in the bad guy. The way he is written is a problem. He doesn't seem REALLY bad and he doesn't seem crazy enough to be really scared of him. So, there is a certain tension lacking. Having said that, this makes the film more palatable for family fare, although probably a bad idea for kids who are sensitive about seeing someone their own age being held against her will.An interesting aspect of the film is that the young girl is not a pathetic victim, but one with her wits about her at all times. The plot has a nice little twist in the middle that leads to some decent suspense. Two ""f words"" in the whole thing. Kind of a nice change-up from the all-swearing, all-the-time action pics. Worth paying to rent or own at a reasonable price.",Along Came a Spider
111,Wulfstan10,Rather Mediocre,5,8 March 2005,"While possessing a few positive points, this film otherwise has a number of failings and overall is a great example of mediocrity. The plot is somewhat entertaining and has a few decent twists, but it is all basically rehashed material. While it has a twist that is somewhat interesting and not entirely predictable, it nevertheless all gives one the feeling that one has seen it all before somewhere and the entire movie feels tired and overall quite dull.As others have pointed out, the best aspects of this movie are some of the performances. Morgan Freeman is, as usual, excellent, proving like some other actors that he can still turn in a really good performance even when given a bad script and stuck in a world of blandness. The same is true of Michael Wincott who is also great as usual. He is so good at playing villains or just sinister people that it really is a shame that he is not in more good movies. Monica Potter also did a good job, particularly at giving off a kind of intangible unpleasant quality that rather subtly, and not obviously, made one want to dislike her, giving further satisfaction as the film progressed.Otherwise, this was a dull, tired film that while not really bad, and probably worth watching for free, is not one I would spend money on.",Along Came a Spider
112,segacs,More plot holes than the Trans-Canada,4,4 September 2005,"James Patterson is a strictly mediocre writer who seems to be ghosting most of his bestsellers these days. Along Came a Spider didn't start off as great material, in other words. But this movie certainly didn't improve upon it, or even make the most of it.The so-called ""plot twists"" were more like plot holes. Without giving too much away, there is an unbelievable amount of the plot that is extremely implausible, and that falls apart under even the mildest amount of scrutiny.The acting was just wince-worthy most of the time, with Morgan Freeman providing the only respite from cardboard cutout-like characters. And what's more, this movie has no ""style"", no redeeming qualities, not even a good soundtrack.If you're looking for a good thriller, there are lots of options.

113,rutt13-1,"Not horrible, but...",6,23 May 2001,"The major fault of the whole action/suspens/thriller genre is that well, after a while they all seem like exactly the same film.  I was none too excited about seeing this for that exact reason, and while the film has much going for it, I got what I expected: another snack from the Hollywood cookie cutter.  (This review will not be a rant on how great independent films are; frankly many of those bore me.) First the good:  Morgan Freeman, of course always turns in a good believable performance.  I'm not a huge fan, but I have a lot of respect for his work.  It's a well-directed film with a good slick look (except for a truly awful CGI car crash) and most of the cast is good as well, with Michael Wincott (who should be in more movies) giving us a creepy villain. Wincott's performance gave some real intensity to the film, and actually had me a little worried about what would happen to the little girl. Overall though, I guess only for those who haven't seen many kidnapping movies, this would prove a great entertainment. Now the bad....Monica Potter was not very believable for me at all. THough she's pretty nice to look at, she came off as pretty awkward.  Maybe she'll work her way up to something like this, but she's not quite there yet.     Then there's all the stereotypical talk like, ""If the kidnapper dies, we'll never find the girl.""  I don't know how many times I've heard this over the years, and maybe it seems like a silly complaint, but it irritated me.     Next up:  why is it that the cops can never find the kidnapper, but he can always find the cops?  Another element of ""Along Came a Spider."" And you know that scene where the hero has to race on foot through the city from phone to phone, with the victim's life hanging in the balance? Yep, it's here too..... And my final complaint....I won't give anything away, but the big twist ending is just the same old thing from many, MANY thrillers I've seen, especially throughout the last 5 years or so.  And this very same thing has been seen in quite a few action movies too.  I'm tired of it.  Either come up with something new, or keep it plain and simple, and don't try to dazzle the audience with ""surprises.""  No matter how good the film is I'm always let down when the filmakers resort to this cliche. I'm gonna give this a 6.  I would say wait for a rental...",Along Came a Spider
114,MadReviewer,"Good, if not great, action thriller",7,16 April 2001,"Pretty good suspense film, based on James Patterson's novel of the same name.  The opening of the film is very implausible, and left a sour taste that took a long time to go away.  Once the main story is well underway, though -- the kidnapping of a U.S. Senator's child by mastermind Gary Soneji -- things get moving along at a tight, crisp pace . . . until about fifteen minutes to go, when a gratuitous ""Keyser Soze-esque"" ending gets tacked on for no good reason.  (To be fair, the ending is similar to the book ending as well -- both leave you scratching your head).Morgan Freeman is exceptionally good, except for the fact that he's a little too old for the Alex Cross role -- Cross, in the novels, is supposed to be a much younger man.  Still, that's a casting flaw, certainly not Freeman's fault, and Freeman makes the most out of a good part.  Monica Potter is excellent as Special Agent Jessie Flanagan as well.  Their performances really make the movie, and they're able to pull off some awfully cliched lines with enough style to make them actually sound good.  Same script with different actors . . . ""Along Came a Spider"" might've been a clunker.Overall, very good.

I won't dwell much on those because on of the reviewers on this message board did a great job (the one that warns us about spoilers). But, the music was done by composer Jerry Goldsmith who has always been one of my favorites. In this film he gives us a great treat by combining Orchestral textures with that of creative synth sounds.  Plus, we get to hear favorite Goldsmith signature passages through out the score.Spoiler coming up: Pay attention to the cue that follows Morgan Freeman in to the subway station and the train shows up. Hear the train bell? Well pay attention now...  and you will hear that the train bell is actually part of the score because it changes pith while following the chord progression of the cue.And the sweet but complex piano theme for the character Megan Rose is another great example of great scoring. Notice how many hits Goldsmith uses as the scenes edit back and forth, especially during the chase scenes.

Soneji starts out as a refreshingly believable killer - in fact, he's pretty normal - but then degenerates into a cliche'd raving loony.

I would love to see Alex Cross done in film again, but I have one stipulation to ask: FOLLOW THE BOOK!!!  For once in your life, Hollywood, just use the book as a script.  These books sell like crazy, and there's a reason. They're written by an amazing novelist, not some hack screenwriter who thinks he can do better.SPOILERS FROM HERE ON DOWN!!!For those of you who have not read the book or seen the movie, you may want to stop reading this right now.  GARY SONEJI LIVES IN THE BOOK!  Not only does he live, but he comes back in number 4, which is one of the best novels in the series.  I guess the producers weren't planning on making any more of these books into movies, because they would have to skip ""Cat and Mouse"". Once Cross killed Soneji in the movie, I just about walked out of the movie right then and there.  I mean, really, it's not that hard to not shoot the bad guy, and keep him around for the next Alex Cross movie.  I hope that James Patterson quits selling the movie rights to his books, because the film industry does nothing but trash them.",Along Came a Spider
139,mlong-5,very good,9,13 April 2002,This movie starts off like any other kidnap thriller would be and then just has a twist which will blow your socks off. It was hard though to comprehend what just happened because it makes you think about how is this possible and how they figured it out so well. Monica Potter in this movie does not do much init and is basically just assists Morgan Freeman in the movie. It would have been better if she was more into the plot then she was. Special effecs in this movie waere not needed esepecially at the beginning. That was a big waste of money and dould have been used for something else like better actors to assist Morgan Freeman. Overall good job,Along Came a Spider
140,r-angle,"FUN, BUT SKIP THE OPENING SEQUENCE",8,30 December 2017,"I saw this on CATV, and I missed the opening sequence. Went back and saw it later, and it's laughable. 
But the rest of this flick is great. It's well done and suspenseful. Every actor is great, especially Morgan Freeman, of course, and the lovely lady, played by Monica Potter. The story actually makes sense. They made a great movie out of what was probably a pretty bad book. Have not read it. Can't usually wade through James Patterson's stuff. 
See this one. It's fun.",Along Came a Spider
141,iprudd,The well played thriller is not yet dead.,7,21 May 2001,"This taught thriller opens with a scene reminiscent of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' with the death of his partner during an operation to catch a serial killer. Cross goes into retirement. He is sharply brought out of this by a call from 'Mr Soneji' who has kidnapped a Senator's daughter. This has been done under the noses of the Secret Service agent who was assigned to protect her, Jezzie Flannigan.She teams up with Cross to try to get her back. The plot moves along crisply with Soneji playing games with Flannigan and Cross. This part of the movie works well.Unfortunately, the film unravels in the last reel. We discover that Flannigan and a fellow Secret Service agent were onto Soneji's plan and in fact, are manipulating the plot to extort money.The film then degenerates into standard Hollywood melodrama, with Flannigan killing her co-conspirator and becoming unhinged and trying to murder her former charge. It of course ends with a show down between Flannigan and Cross.This is a shame because until this point this film had been a good thriller. Despite this Freeman provides his usual class performance. Potter demonstrates that she has got what it takes to become a top flight actress with a well measured performance. Mika Boorem is yet another high class child actor who shows that she can act with the best of them in a thoroughly creditable performance.",Along Came a Spider
142,huggybear-2,Along came another mediocre thriller screenplay,6,26 June 2001,"I often wonder why people make films like these.  Unremarkable.  Unlikely to make a huge amount of money.  No new ideas.  Recycling of plenty of old ones, some of which are even good ones.One advantage of films like these is that you know exactly what you're going to get.  Morgan Freeman is reliable as ever and Monica Potter is definitely pleasant eye candy, if an unlikely future Oscar winner.As for the plot - well, it chugs along and doesn't place too much strain on the viewer to guess where it's going.Undemanding fare.",Along Came a Spider
143,slimjack,"It's sort of ""just there"" but you may like it.",5,29 March 2002,"Along Came a Spider is not a bad movie all in all.  It is just a generic movie and a pretty decent generic movie at that.  Lets face it, every plot is based on clichés. What counts is how these clichés are used.  The screenwriter's challenge is this: Can he blow enough smoke and juggle his mirrors in such a way as to make the viewer believe he is seeing something new or, at least, enjoy the same old crap?  Shakespeare did it.  Dickens did it.  Stephen King has made a career out of it.  The problem with Along Came a Spider is that no-frills clichés are all you get, basic and unadorned. The movie's ad campaign should have featured bare white posters, a bar code and the word `Thriller' printed in the middle. Okay, I overstate.  You do get Morgan Freeman and Michael Wincott. Mr. Freeman has never given a bad performance and doesn't start with this film.  Mr. Wincott is also very, very good. He makes you feel a little sorry for his character despite his murderous escapades. You rather want to comfort him when the inevitable problems start cropping up.To make sure you are getting your moneys worth, the writers have thrown in a `Guaranteed Surprise Ending"". Now some movies sport twist endings that are knockouts.  These endings not only come as genuine surprises and are completely satisfying; they force you to reconsider everything that went before in the film.  Think of The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects or The Crying Game. First, in all these movies the ending was prepared for.  No matter how unexpected ultimately the twists make sense in the terms of the logic of the movie.  Second, you recognize these movies as superior long before you reach the conclusion.  Had The Sixth Sense ended five minutes before it did you still would have remembered the performances, the genuinely scary moments and the fantastic plot.  The twist came as icing on an already fine cake. Along Came A Spider has a surprise ending because, well, 'Thrillers' have `Surprise Endings'.  That's all.  You probably won't guess it, but even so you won't be all that surprised.  You will realize that since because such and such happens, the movie can only end in two or three different ways. Like the rest of the movie the twist is mechanical and non-descript.  It's satisfying enough but it operates more as a punctuation mark than anything else.This sounds like a pretty negative review - and I guess it is.  In fairness I should say I enjoyed myself watching it.  A predictable experience is not necessarily a bad experience.  Sometimes all you want is a no frills `Thriller'.  You have a taste in your mouth for guns and psychopaths and you've already seen Hannibal, so what do you do?  Sure, a movie that sautés it's clichés with a bit more sauce and spice would be preferable, but if your only other option is a Matlock rerun, Along Came A Spider looks pretty darn good!",Along Came a Spider
144,experten,Artificial story but still entertaining,6,7 October 2001,"Good things: Highly paced, never boring . Morgan Freeman is in it. Michael Wincott is good as the villain. Surprising plot twist. Some violence.Bad things: Artificial story were clues are left intentionally. It´s not only Cross (MF) that is unbelievably intelligent, the kids are also too smart. One scene is directly copied from Dirty Harry. Soneji (Wincott) makes things unnecessary complicated for himself. Why not go directly for what you want, it would have been easier ? Why did his preparations have to drag on for years ? The ending, after the surprise plot twist, is very standard and becomes an anticlimax. Unbelievable use of computer clues, especially the improbable guessing of a password. (Anyone knows that an important password should never be something with a meaning that someone else can connect with you, so why choose such a password ? And why would Cross come up with the idea that this password had been used ? And even more illogical: why leave clues behind in the PC in the first place ? The same password could also have been written in a number of ways, with `and' instead of `&', with only capital letters, only small letters or a combination, but Cross gets it right in the first try.)Minor problem: Obvious use of computer graphics in the beginning.This kind of detective story, were the detective does not use conventional clues such as witnesses and fingerprints but have to find far fetched clues to make him look smart,  is very hard to make believable but the movie is still entertaining and well worth seeing.

145,Nahret,Underrated. 7 of 10.,7,5 July 2002,"The plot starts out in a very straight-forward manner: a man with an ambition to become criminal legend kidnaps the daughter of a congressman right out from under the nose of the FBI. He then sends a note and a sneaker of the girl to Detective Alex Cross, hence forcing him out of his self-inflicted isolation, the reasons of which are explained in the opening scene. Along with the FBI agent who was in charge of security at the scene of the crime, he follows the clues laid out by the kidnapper in order to find the girl. And so the story goes. The kidnapper is portrayed by the always formidable Michael Wincott, the best serial villain on that side of the Atlantic. He should have the Best Supporting Role awards piled up in his attic. Alex Cross, whom we remember from ""Kiss the Girls"", and portrayed by Morgan Freeman, is just the kind of cop you like best: sincere, sympathetic, intelligent, thorough and committed. Monica Potter features as the FBI agent determined to redeem herself after she let the kidnapper escape. This may not be a blockbuster, but this solid and underrated thriller delivers what so few of them have to offer these days: a final plot twist that genuinely surprises.

For years peoplehave been abridging books successfully.  Why can't they make thestory shorter without completely changing it.  I guess if I hadn'tread the book, it might have been rated a few higher, but it stillwouldn't be a great movie.  Basically, there are better moviethrillers to watch and plenty of books you could read instead ofwasting your time watching this.",Along Came a Spider
147,MovieSoup,Thrilling but has too many flaws to ignore.,5,8 October 2017,"The only reason this film was enjoyable was because Morgan Freeman is in it and James Patterson wrote the book the script is based on. This film has a lot of flaws which I will discuss but first I must just focus on the few good things to get them out of the way. Morgan Freeman is great in this film. He is very believable as Alex Cross and does a great job of playing a criminal profiler. The reason he plays it so well is due to his retrospective, calm but analytical voice that he uses in all of his films to great effect. His voice gives the impression of great wisdom and endless patience which is what a good detective must have.Freeman's facial expressions, too, are spot on for the scenes he is in and give a gravitas to his performance that only a great actor can give. There are a few little things like he is slightly too old for the character and he has a few lines that fall flat but on the whole I enjoyed his performance.The plot of the movie is good as well and does follow very close to the excellent book it is based on. I have been a fan of the Alex Cross series for a while and this movie does capture the Patterson style of suspense and thrillingness that we expect from anything relating to this series (thrillingness is not a word but screw you it is my review).The Problem with this film is every other actor involved is weak. This film has some very wooden performances and terrible actors who emote nothing and add nothing to the scenes they are in. Dylan Baker is terrible in this film. His character has no emotion what so ever and is just so bland on screen that I find every scene he is in to be BLEH. The problem is that Baker is only good for playing small roles like in Spiderman 3 where he is in it for 30 seconds. When you put him in longer scenes you can tell how much of a poor actor he is. I think it is best to put him in a short cameo or TV show but not a full length film. He just can't act realistically. Monica Potter as Flannigan is just terrible and does nothing for the characters persona at all. The sad thing is that in the book she was a much more interesting character that I really liked and wanted to see her done right on film. Every emotion she does is unconvincing and really makes me feel a bit embarrassed for her. She only has one emotion and that is ""dumbfounded curiosity"" which gets a bit draining after seeing it 50,000,000 times. I was hoping for something a bit more real from her character and Potter just failed to deliver.Child actors in this are a very mixed bag. On one side you have a young Anton Yelchin playing an okay role as a school boy who is semi important to the plot. On the other hand you have Mika Boorem playing an unconvincing captured kid that is just boring to watch and unconvincing. However this did not ruin the film for me as I do not expect much from child actors as they can all be rubbish in film unless directed diligently. The technical side of things is disappointing. Obviously the music is just stock music that they bought of a company and it completely shows. Its not BAD music it is just very cookie cutter and does some scenes a disservice by being too stilted and not framing a scene in the right light. The colour palet of the film is grey and dull with no imagination and the camera work is so still and undynamic in dynamic scenes that it takes me out of the film a bit.It is a shame but I suppose when you have a small budget ofWAIT $60,000,000!!!!?? WTF??? For $60,000,000 they could have made this movie so much better than it was. They could have spent much more on camera work, lighting, decent actors ETC. Where the $60,000,000 was spent I do not know but it is a shame that probably most of it went into Freemans pay.A GREAT film like Reservoir Dogs was made for $1,200,000 and that was shot better, looked better and had a better supporting cast than this movie. It just goes to show that with a great director the budget of a film can be small but still be enjoyable to watch and brilliant on every other level as well. This film is a decent film with a great plot and storytelling but what lets it down is the supporting cast, the useless music and the drab, colourless cinematography. Unfortunately no matter how much I love Morgan Freeman or the books of James Patterson it will not make me love this movie. I did enjoy this film but the flaws are reflected in the score I have given.",Along Came a Spider

He is joined in his hunt for the ""spider"" by the special agent who was in charge of security for the girl.  Played wonderfully by Monica Potter.

Laughable, predictable (very), by-the-numbers crap. Morgan Freeman is a fine actor but whenever you hear that an actor was ""sleepwalking"" the part, just use his lead in this movie as a text-book reference. Monica Potter is gorgeous, I will make no bones about that, but you have to wonder as to who was the casting genius that threw old Monica into this thankless role.I honestly would expect more thrills out of a ""Movie for a Rainy Sunday Evening"" on NBC, BBC or CBS. You name it.Alex Cross, mate, you are right up there on the crap-o-meter with Hercule Poirot, 'Murder She Wrote' and the 'Father 'Sodding' Dowling Mysteries'.

153,azaro666,More of the same (yawn),6,12 May 2001,"There is only one or two things which save this movie from being an absolute farce. The first is a fairly accomplished performance from Morgan Freeman who seems incapable of giving a poor performance and leaves the questioned being asked as to where has he been all his life. The second plus point of the movie is a brilliant ransom drop-off which lasts for 10 minutes and culminates in a sequence which leaves you breathless. It really does make you grateful for your money, but the fact that this scene makes you pleased is enough reason to justify your complaint at its obvious downfalls.A director like Tamahori is more than capable of delivering drama of the highest quality, but the one thing lacking in this thriller is the drama. There is absolutely none at all. The plot is very half-baked and only has enough momentum to carry half the movie. Perhaps this where the drama needs to happen. After all there are enough actors there to give us some drama, but instead the writer has opted out and decided throw us into Hitchcock territory. That just about p***es the audience off, we were clever enough to get up to this point without being lost so why on earth should we tred back over muddy ground.There are three or four twists thrown in which are not exactly surprising and leave you turning over to your girlfriend and saying I knew that would happen. We are left in the mind of the write rather than the viewer which soon becomes frustrating.Perhaps every idea in movies has been dreamed up so that now we have become a cinema savvy audience and can see the mysteries before they are. If that is the case then is very unfortunate. Plot holes, poor direction and characterless characters leave this one as a real disappointment.

This starts out in a deceptively simple manner and becomes graduallymore complex until the end.  Fans of suspense thrillers (such as myself) should really enjoy this. SPOILER ALERT  >>>
  The linchpin of the film is Potter's character. Notice how Cross immediately insists upon her presence during the investigation.  She has special knowledge, but does he also want to keep an eye on her?  This subtlety (not in the book from what I understand because there they fall in love) makes Cross seem even more intelligent and perceptive. Sometimes movies improve on books in some aspects. The oldest cliche is 2 people working together who fall in love. This trap is avoided here and it really helps the film. Wincott is terrific and his convincing portrayal makes the ""lone psycho"" theory seem to be the only possible explanation for the relative ease of his escape from the school and (later) the ransom. Potter's resemblance to Julia Roberts is uncanny, although I also saw some Sandra Bullock in her expressions.  This is a wonderful movie for actors to shine and those are my favorite kinds of movies. Thanks to Freeman, Potter and Wincott, this is a riveting and underrated film. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.",Along Came a Spider

172,MrPink080,Rose. . . Megan Rose,3,14 April 2001,"Along Came a Spider tries to follow in the footsteps of its successful and suspensful predecesor, Kiss The Girls, but instead of holding its own, Along Cmae a Spider is squashed like a bug.While Morgan Freeman remains and gives an equally outstanding performance, his supporting cast is not up to the same standards. Monica Potter showcases neither the depth, nor the charisma that Ashley Judd did in its predecesor. The villians whoms names i willnot reveal here do not rival that of Tony Goldwyn, nor Cary Elwes. Megan Rose is played well for a young actor, but the part was written far too unbelievably. I began to wonder if she was the daughter of James Bond at certain points in this picture.  The scenario that goes down in the last 15 minutes is so far-fethced that i found myself yearning for Starship Trooperish realism.To the movie's credit, aside from the lack of realism, the first 3/4ths of the movie was at least able to hold my attention, but the ending was so bizarre and unexplained that i wished i hadn't bothered with the rest.
The best i can give it is a 3 out of 10. The script has more plot holes then this review has words. I'm not sure that I've wondered ""why did that happen?"" or ""how did that happen?"" so many times in a single film.",Along Came a Spider

How come he has no knowledge of the ransom request? He disapproves of Cross' attempts of trickery, but why does he use deceit himself during the conversation about the 12 million? - Jonathan manufactors and sticks a beard to his face every day, for 2 years, in order to look like Soneji. Why this disguise, since he was to come face to face with Cross anyway?

When he is onscreen, your attention is drawn to him and you want to believe what he is saying.  Too bad the writers didn't give any thought to the rest of the script.  When a bad guy doesn't really have a motive to do what he is doing, why should we be afraid of him?

Stupid clichés thrown together in an incredible mess. You know types: the let's watch the video that we saw a hundred times again so that we can discover something that should have been plainly obvious the first time. This movie was never able to figure out what it wants to be: A psychological thriller, a political thriller or a clever double and triple crossing suspense movie. The wise producers must have thought that throwing three movies in one will make three times the money. Their wisdom probably did not reach the height to realize that such attempts never work.The film can keep your attention, cinematography is good and Morgan Freeman is an excellent actor who can project integrity even if the world and the story around him have none. Her co-star on the other hand fits with the story perfectly. Equally dumb and pretty. I doubt that we will see too much of her in the future but maybe for the same reason we will.

178,toffeedragon-3,A truly awful adaptation.,1,25 September 2007,"I usually shy away from slating a movie and give a constructive critique but after reading the book of 'Along came a spider' and then watching the film I have to say that the director/producer/screenwriter have made an absolute hash of an above average thriller.I am aware that not everyone will have read the book but even so the character development is non existent and the characters and relationships between them have been so changed and watered down that it becomes nonsensical.For instance, it does not delve into the reasons for Gary Soneji kidnapping the child and trying to make a game out of it. The actual reason is that Gary was abused and locked into a basement by his stepfamily leading to him having quite a warped outlook on life. He is also very very intelligent and had supposedly murdered more than 200 people. Gary believes that he is intellectually superior to others and can make a game out of the kidnapping because he doesn't believe that he can be caught. He also named himself the 'Son of Lindburgh' after an unsolved kidnapping of a small child in the 1930s, a kidnapping which he admires.Alex Cross is in his late 30s, has children, lives with Nana Mama (as his parents are dead) and has a relationship with Jezzie Flanagan from which the twist appears. The story also unfolds over a period of two years not a couple of weeks as seems to be the case in the film.The problem with this is that Morgan Freeman has been brought in to sell the film on the strength of his performance in Se7en. Unfortunately this is a mistake and they should have hired a younger actor who could have been more like the character in the novel and left the story to sell itself. These days a film that tanks at the box office can recover through word of mouth and DVD sales. The Shawshank Redemption being an example.Also, the plot requires too many leaps of faith and the fact that what the clue was that Alex Cross has picked up on is not very clear and is badly edited making it confusing for the viewer.This story would have been better if it was half an hour longer and used the time to examine the psychological aspects of the film in greater detail. I even believe that it would have been better as a TV mini series which would have allowed the massive FBI manhunt to unfold with greater dramatic effect.",Along Came a Spider
179,ablewuzi,When any old swill will do,3,30 October 2013,"What an embarrassment! Yet another Royal Nonesuch. Actors, indeed, almost anyone except the director and editors can be forgiven for being involved with this ridiculous dog of a movie because they have little idea about how bad it is going to scan when it comes out of the cutting room. What's wrong with it is that it stretches credibility until the movie becomes pathetic and laughable. Need specifics? Well for one, imagine a dwarf impersonating Frodo Baggins every day for five years in a high security private school by simultaneously a) single-handedly applying prosthetic makeup to himself good enough to fool all the students, administrators, teachers and secret service agents for five years running and b) being an top-notch hot-shot impeccable empathetic computer science teacher.Imagine he does all this so he can kidnap one student from the class, for the sole purpose of tricking a second student from the very same class to expose himself to a second completely different, but wholly ad hoc, drive by and snatch kidnap plot. He seems to be a complete loser except for pulling this plan off, for which he has no apparent motive, and appears to have a million dollars worth of security equipment stashed in his apartment. Oh, and he has a yacht. When James Bond went up against Specter, the Specter gadgets were always unbelievable but, because it was a big well-healed outfit, it was possible to suspend disbelief, but a loser wearing buck teeth and a wig---come on.Or how about the explosive charge the kidnappee happens to find hidden behind the intercom face plate in her otherwise featureless cell, padded like the confinement room in an insane asylum.And that's just for starters.

That's the olfactory equivalent of watching this film. I can't imagine any reason other than contractual obligations why Morgan Freeman would agree to be an accessory to this.  From the soporific sequence in which Freeman and his blonde mannequin like partner drone on and on for what seems like hours, to the lame, cliched games of the kidnapper (including a direct ripoff of Dirty Harry) to the absolutely ludicrous 'plot twist' which seemed as if they ran out of script before they had 90 minutes worth of story, to the endless mouthing of the kidnapper's name, (""Soneji! Soneji! Soneji!"" over and over and over) and especially the idiotically contrived scene in which Freeman guesses a password, complete with the use of '&' instead of 'and' on the FIRST TRY, this 'movie' absolutely reeked.  If I was a director and had dropped this turd of a film, I would have credited it to Allen Smithee and gone back to working in a video store.  Don't go and see this.

The timeline of Alex Cross ""figuring out"" what's happening is just too quick.I was shocked that Freeman was a producer on this film, because, besides him, the editing of the film is horrible. I was left wondering when the suspension of disbelief was supposed to be presented.No doubt, Freeman, as usual, is phenominal and believable as a character. His acting is as superb as ever.

192,RyeDough,Fine,7,29 August 2014,"An OK thriller, but nothing terribly original. As a mainstream detective film, it does quite well. It is well-acted by everybody, especially Michael Wincott. Though perhaps that is because he has one of the few characters with a bit of diversity (as well as Monica Potter perhaps). Morgan Freeman puts in a great performance as always, but his performance didn't comprise of as much as it should have. The character of Cross was fairly 2-dimensional.The plot is decent, only perhaps a tad ridiculous in places, with the killer laying out very, very obscure clues which he somehow assumed would be solved. The ending has a few nice twists and turns, but does leave a couple of unanswered questions.The main problems are that it isn't very original or creative and it is quite dull, for a thriller. Well, maybe not dull, but it just lacks any suspense or tension, probably because the villain is more likable than Cross. Certainly more interesting. A lot of the scenes involving Cross and the villain are almost lighthearted. I wouldn't go as far as to call it boring, because it's not. It just isn't very tense either.",Along Came a Spider

196,Bullingdon,Freeman is over-qualified for this movie.,5,8 April 2001,"Morgan Freeman is too skilled to be doing generic crime thrillers. He sleepwalks through `Along Came a Spider' like Mr. Magoo in a construction zone. The man's eyes do more acting than the whole ensemble of this film, and his lackadaisical approach is skilled, but belongs to worthy projects similar to last years masterful ""Nurse Betty."" SPOILER ALERT `Along Came a Spider' is another one of those James Patterson film adaptations that involves a senators daughter being kidnapped, and Alex Cross being called out of his slump to solve the case. The term cat and mouse will invariable come up in this review, I hated that term. I gave `Kiss the Girls' a C+, but after seeing `Along Came a Spider,' I appreciate that stories atmosphere and semi plausible storyline to the comic book logic in ""Along Came a Spider."" Morgan Freeman who was good in both Alex Cross detective films, the man still needs a workable script, with an ounce of edginess,  intrigue and or plausibility to make this series work. Monica Potter (the wife from `Con Air') plays Cross' new partner, who's a neophyte secret service agent tagging along with Cross to learn the tricks of the trade. I liked Potter as his partner, she fits well into the lame storyline and has a cute naiveté, although I can't imagine how she's going to learn to be a physic detective. Every time Freeman sits down and looks at a computer screen, he manages to inexplicably find a clue within seconds. I guess it's the eyes. There's a scene that involves yet another showdown between Alex Cross and the criminal mastermind of this elaborate kidnapping, who's more into playing that cat and mouse game with Cross than getting the ransom. What's with serial killers these days? Ever since `Se7en' they all want to play fricken games like they're the Joker in Gothaem city. The heavy in `Along Came a Spider' is so obtuse that he puts on a fake face (A la `Mission Impossible') for two whole years, then he becomes a great teacher that just happens to get his mark in his class. And all of this so he simply kidnap the senators girl, just to call Alex Cross up on the phone so he can be his adversary. And all of that work was just to get to the Russian Presidents child who is a totally different kid than the one he has. I'm scratching my head, but I'm not making this crap up. What's going on here, did anyone read this script, or was everybody too eager to make a sequel (or prequel) to the successful `Kiss the Girls?' Get the money, then play games you dumb s***. Where was I? Oh yea, the standoff. The hero and villain are face to face and the Joker says: `That's transparent and clumsy' to Cross, referring to his fairly obvious deductions regarding the where about of the senators missing daughter. Yup, that about sums up my feelings regarding `Along Came a Spider,' careless and clumsy, but its got Morgan so its not a total loss. Oh, by the way, the killer is so obsessed with playing some sort of homoerotic mind game with Cross, that this little kidnapped girl dupes him through acting like a Spy Kid, and throwing a battery into his teapot, which in turn causes one of these lavish movie fires.
Character actors Jay o Sanders,(in a cameo)and Dylan Baker fill in the casting gaps with their consistency reliable performances. In fact, the movies only real distinction is the character arc of Carl Monroe played by that guy from `Happiness.' Dylan Baker luckily is in every other movie these days, finally the industry has taken notice of this man. Maybe Nicky Katt will be next. There's a general consensus in cop movies, that there always be that one guy who is totally clueless and his this austere approach to debunk the protagonist mission even though there both on the same side. I call it the Sergeant Dwayne T, Robinson factor, named after that cop in `Die Hard' who ALWAYS managed to condescend Al Powell by barking orders like; ""If there's terrorists in there, where's their list of demands? All we know is that whoever shot your car up is probably the same silly sonofabitch you've been talking to on that radio,"" even though it was painfully obvious that Bruce Willis was the good guy. `Along Came a Spider' starts with Dylan Baker being that prick of a cop by insulting Cross. Then, a few minutes later a miracle happens, the guy actually apologizes to Cross for being such an asshole, and they become friends the rest of the movie. Ha, great, wonderful, than you director Lee Tamhori for surprising me, once. The reason so much space is dedicated to that innocuous aspect of the film is because the rest is so boring its' not worth dissecting.I give it a 5 out of 10.",Along Came a Spider

199,joepetrizzi,Somewhat entertaining...like a Lifetime movie,5,27 January 2002,"This movie was fairly entertaining if you can get past the plot holes. It's a thriller, where Morgan Freeman brings back the role of detective/profiler/mind-reader Alex Cross, who you may remember from Kiss the Girls.  It's based on the novel by Patterson, which I haven't read, about the kidnapping of a senator's daughter.  It was OK, but it could have been so much better in the hands of a great screenwriter.  Instead, it feels like Hollywood mailed this one in once Freeman signed on.The movie reminded me of the movies they show on the Lifetime network.  I watched this movie with my wife and she loved it as much as she loves the Lifetime marathons on Sunday.  The problem with Lifetime movies, and ACAS, is that they all treat the audience members like total idiots.  Important knowledge about the story is handed to the main characters, characters know or remember things that you wouldn't expect, etc.  Instead of creating an interesting way to get from A to B, we go straight out the A door and into the B door, as if the only reason the story even happens is so that we get caught by the plot twist at the end.  It's not suspenseful, and the only reason we get caught by surprise at all is because we've been lulled to sleep.  Thankfully, the movie ends quickly as soon as the pony shows his one trick.Along Came A Spider also contains my pet peeve, which is that it abuses technology to advance the plot.  The victims this time are once again computers and the internet, which the script abuses throughout the film - including the now classic ""I could explain the whole movie if I only knew this computer's password!""  I would have been less insulted if the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock appeared and moved the story along.Monica Potter doesn't really get the job done as the female lead.  She's certainly pretty, but she's also as wooden as a mannequin.  I'm sure she has a bright career ahead of her starring in straight-to-Lifetime movies like ""She Walked Alone"" and ""Stranger With My Baby.""  In fact, the only difference between Along Came A Spider and your standard Sunday on Lifetime is another great performance by Freeman, who is one of a few actors we can really count on.  He raises the bar on this film around 2 points for me, so I rate it a 6.",Along Came a Spider
200,Moviemasterh80,"This movie was definitely ""Stand Alone sequel""",9,30 September 2001,"While the feelings of the film are still fresh in my mind, I would like to say that ""Along Came a Spider"" was better than ""Kiss the Girls"". It has the atmosphere of a classic detective thriller. First of all, it is a sequel to ""Kiss the Girls"".(Which is often forgotten by many). It's a sequel that stands on it's own,(like such ""not considered"" sequels as ""U.S. Marshals"",and ""Hannibal"" just to name a couple)which is why I like it. It does it's own thing, rather than proceeding to take off where it's predecessor left off. I really don't want to ruin anything for you so I'll just say this.GOOD qualities: Morgan Freeman delivers another good ""Alex Cross"" performance The rest of the cast is good The suspense is top quality And there's a Surprise Plot twist! (You'll never see it coming) It's not too long and over drawn like ""Kiss the Girls""(Don't get me wrong ""Kiss the Girls was awesome, just a tad bit long)BAD qualities: You can tell the opening action sequence is CGI(But it still is a good action sequence) Jay O. Sanders is back(He was in ""Kiss the Girls"" too) but for only 2 minutes The deleted moments of the film were deleted,but why? They were good!(I had seen them in the theatrical trailer)So ""Along Came a Spider"" gets a: 9/10, ****1/2 out of *****, 92% out of 100%, A- from an A+, Very GoodP.S. ""Not considered"" sequels usually have the best character from the predecessor and don't need a number to indicate that they're sequels! They really don't need their predecessor to be good or even be possible. These movies could be possible even if ""predecessors"" didn't come out!

And with Morgan Freeman in the lead role it is usually a recipe for success as in Kiss The Girls and Se7en. But Along Came A Spider never really captures you like te previously mentioned films. The script isn't particularly bad and certainly has some original ideas. But there are gaping holes that leave you wondering Why did that happen? and Why did he say that? Also i wasn't overly impressed with the choice of leading lady, and this causes no real chemistry like Jodie Foster in Silence of the Lambs or the friendship between Freeman and Pitt in Se7en.

207,davidsco27,Along Comes Another Great Book Ruined by Hollywood,5,18 April 2001,"Of the James Patterson/Alex Cross books, this one was the best.  I remember being fully engulfed in the story and the way Patterson weaved the intricate Gary Soneji and his lair.  That notwithstanding, almost none of it appears in this movie.  Having come away from the 1st movie based on a Patterson book (Kiss The Girls) mildly disappointed, I was really hoping this one would be better, as it is based on the better book.  WRONG!  This one was far worse.  Gone is the elaborate underground fortress Soneji kept his victims in, and gone is any depth and real motivation to his character. Although the actor playing Soneji is a great villain, he just wasn't given the material here to really shine, and then his thunder was stolen from him by a cheap Hollywood twist of fate that obviously some director felt was necessary (maybe to change the ending for those who have read the book?) Big mistake!  It took an otherwise excellent thriller and made it into the typical run-of-the-mill 2-bit Hollywood excuse.  Unfortunately, this prolongs the recent drought of movies worth the over $8 price tag.  Unquestionably, this past year and a half has been the worst in memory for movies, and I just don't see the end in sight.",Along Came a Spider
208,tcamst,~~The book was so much better~~,5,4 January 2002,"I never thought I would say this, but the book was so much better.  It was almost like a totally different story.  The character of Gary Soneji was a major character in the book, but the movie down played him so bad that half way through the movie you had forgotten all about him.  Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and his role in ""Kiss the Girls"" as Alex Cross encouraged me to read more stories by James Patterson.  The fact that he starred in the movie is really it's only redeeming quality.  He was a perfect choice for the character of Alex Cross, but for this film it was like watching a different person (maybe his role in Nurse Betty did damage to his career).  He did so much better in Kiss the Girls.
I can only hope that if there are to be more Alex Cross movies that they seek a new director because Lee Tamahori did not do this movie the justice that it deserved.  Seriously who picked this guy?  I understand that he is now working on the new Bond film, let's just hope he doesn't muck that film up they way he did this one.",Along Came a Spider

If you're looking for a late night suspense movie, you could do worse. At least there are a few interesting angles and twists, but nothing you haven't seen before.My primary reason to leave a comment is to say what a terrible performance was given by Monica Potter. She played about 95% of her scenes with same facial expression. And I didn't hear her utter a line that was believable. Her performance would have been underwhelming in a high school play. I kept waiting for her to grow into the role, but it never happens.It wasn't one of Morgan Freeman's best performances, but he was enjoyable and I could buy into his character.

I was extremely disappointed. There is not one similarity between the film and the book. the characters have different names, the plot is all over the place and doesn't bare a single resemblance to the novel. Whilst reading the novel, I couldn't put it down because it grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go, the film however, I was barely able to stay awake to see the end. the action scenes are poorly done, It's set on a boat.

Once again this movie reaffirmed you cannot enjoy a movie of a book you have read.  This movie combines all of Patterson's book with the  Alex Cross character.  In fact, I had just finished reading Roses Are Red the day before and a major scene in the book was incorporated in this movie.  I was disappointed in the fact that the main nemesis, Gary, who was played out so well in several books, was neatly taken care of in one movie.   I, too, agree that Freeman is too old to play  Alex Cross.  Blair Underwood or Denzel Washington would have been a better choice.  I was also disappointed that Nana and Alex's children were left out of the movie.  I do understand that Hollywood makes movies to make money.  I would recommend this movie to people who haven't read Patterson in depth, but if you are a Patterson fan, see if you can pick out which books are portrayed throughout the movie.",Along Came a Spider

At each plot twist i couldn't help but just laugh, the screen writer should just be sued for infringing on copyrights, then tard and featherd and run out of LA with the producers.  At each turn of events i couldn't help to feel a very strong case of deja-vu, just like 'hey i saw that in (insert kidnapping movie here.)'  In general, i have a big gripe with movie producers, if a movie or genere of movies does well then we as movie viewers are submited to a bombardment of copycats and just general rip offs.

224,lillianecoldwell,Good movie with flat ending,7,24 April 2001,"""Along Came A Spider"" is the sequel to 1997's thriller ""Kiss the Girls"", in which Morgan Freeman plays detective and author Alex Cross. The action starts immediately when Cross's partner dies in a horrible car accident while attempting to take down a suspect in a case. Cross feels responsible for her death and retires. He pours himself into making model ships at home, much to his wife's disdain. Eight months after the tragic accident, there is a kidnapping at an elite private school in Washington, D.C. Shortly thereafter, Cross receives a strange phone call that he quickly recognizes is attached to the recent kidnapping of a senator's daughter. Cross notes that the perpertrator specifically wants him on the case, and he immediately gets to work. He meets the Secret Service agents that were assigned to protect the daughter, although we are never told why she needs protection. The movie takes several interesting plot twists that catch the viewer completely off guard. The ending is rather lackluster and I left the theater with somewhat of an empty feeling. I enjoyed the movie alone, but it lacked the intensity that ""Kiss the Girls"" had. This movie is rated R, and for good reason. Overall, I would recommend this movie to any adult looking for a good action, crime movie.",Along Came a Spider

They turned one of the greatest criminal masterminds in the history of literature into an inept bumbler that could be outwitted by a child. I don't know if they didn't understand the book but the cliff notes version they came up with was sadly lacking. The movie Kiss the Girls stayed fairly true to the book and it was a very good film. If this is what the writers' of Hollywood have to offer then maybe a strike won't be such a bad thing.

When a Government Official's daughter is kidnapped, Cross is brought in by the kidnapper, to break the clues. There is double-cross and triple cross in this thriller movie. Jezze (Monica Potter), a Secret Service agent who was assigned to guard the girl,  joins him in his search for the kidnapped girl.  In twists and turns, the plot thickens when Cross realizes that the kidnapped girl is a ploy to get an even bigger prize, a Russian diplomat's son.  Morgan Freeman is Alex Cross and gives a fine performance as he did in ""Kiss The Girls"" with Ashley Judd. However, when the kidnapper starts him on a running journey to answer one payphone after another, it stretches my belief limit.  Potter turns in a great performance as the partner he really didn't want but said, ""If he didn't let her help him, she would just follow him anyway"" and the ending was a shock to me.  I never would have guessed it.  I won't give it away here but let's say that Monica Potter has a big future in movies and her resemblence to Julia Roberts was not overlooked and can't hurt.

Now, this movie entertains, but the one thing it does not do is stick. It has many plot holes.Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) has gone into a world of isolation after the death of his partner. But, one year later, a brilliant criminal (Michael Wincott) manages to kidnap the daughter of a United States senator from the heavily-guarded private school. He then draws Cross back into the game where he must team up with the secret service agent that let the girl go (Monica Potter).This film, like many other films, suffers from the one to many plot twist disease. The film is traditional, nothing new here. It is quite enjoyable, but just doesn't stick. *SPOILERS* Like, when Cross is hacking into some computer, he notices something (convenietly) and clicks on something on the computer which just so happens to bring him into some handy-cam that leads him into the home of the kidnapper (even more conveniently).

A very stero-typical film with negative energy. Spend your movie-watching time elsewhere because a lot of the TV dramas are of better quality then this film.

242,davelawr,Very disappointing.,2,22 July 2001,"I'm loathe to compare books to movies, since both are completely different media that are intended to stimulate in different ways, but when a movie is an adaptation of a novel comparisons are inevitable. So, the question is what makes for a successful adaptation? If you are in search of an answer to this question, the answer won't be found with ""Along Came a Spider"" since I believe it's the worst adaptation of a novel I've ever had the misfortune of experiencing.The method for this adaptation seemed to be to take the well-developed plot, with three-dimensional characters and one of the most interesting and complex criminals I've seen in the genre and gut it down to its very core. What remains is the basic premise of the plot along with the twist, but with all the details and development removed it becomes totally ridiculous. Characters are completely undeveloped and are barely two dimensional. The worst hit is the Gary Soneji character (portrayed rather weakly by Michael Wincott), who instead of being complex becomes a mere cardboard cutout of a psychopath. The basic plot is barely functional and to me was nothing more than a series of events happening one after the other with the movie progressing from one event to the next without any real structure. What this all amounts to is another dire Hollywood thriller that one could confuse for any typically bland made-for-TV movie, if it was not for the name actors involved. Morgan Freeman does the best he possibly can with the material and really is the only reason to watch the movie. I'm not sold on Monica Potter's acting ability, but to be fair her character is as undeveloped as that of the Soneji character.To sum up, ""Along Came a Spider"" is the worst movie I've seen at the cinema this year, and as such I cannot recommend it to anyone. For anyone unfamiliar with the book, you'll find a sub-par thriller with a ludicrous twist. For those that have read the book, you'll more than likely wonder how such a travesty could have been made of it.Avoid.",Along Came a Spider

It proclaimed intelligence while offering only sub-witty dialogue and lackluster plot.The action scenes were done well enough; engaging, well paced, and not too over the top.The high point of the film, and it's only saving grace, would be Michael Wincott and Morgan Freeman, who were both excellent as usual.All in all, I walked out of the movie feeling a little ripped off. I don't like slamming down for a 50 dollar evening unless I'm seeing a really good film. What I got was a sometimes interesting, mildly entertaining, average movie.

251,clayton everett,A solid piece of Hollywood filmmaking and a jolly good thriller,8,12 March 2001,"Based on the novel by James Patterson, 'Along Came A Spider' is a follow up to the 1997 thriller 'Kiss The Girls'. It is a solid piece of Hollywood storytelling, with a cool twist at the end, which had me fooled, and a story in which the Cross character must use all of his skills to save a small child from a would-be criminal mastermind. Freeman is definitely a class act, in any role he gives just what is needed, and this is no exception. His rendering of Dr Cross is highly cynical and equally clinical as he tries to profile the kidnapper in order to save the child. Monica Potter is also on good form as the disgraced Secret Service agent trying to regain her standing with her colleagues after Soneji escaped from her so simply. But Michael Wincott has very difficult role here at times clinically disposing of people who get in his way, but also trying to be reassuring to his captive who he doesn't seem to want to hurt. Check this movie out when it finally gets here, especially if you're a fan of our homegrown police profiler, Robbie Coltrane as 'Cracker'.Clayton Everett",Along Came a Spider
252,viki_san,So much to the much awaited movie. Not livin up to the standards of Morgan Freeman's usual perfomance.,2,23 April 2001,"In the age of graphics, it was really disheartening to see a movies image crash because of its very own crash scene at the begining. The graphics of the Car Crash was too bad, i should say too kiddish. One would loose their very image of the movie after that, no matter how well it was shot. Tried to cash on the perfomance of the Child Artist in Bless The Child, Ol tricks dont work anymore. Over all the tempo of the movie was not maintained. I lost interest in the first 20 minutes of the movie. A bag of Pop Corn kept me busy for the rest of the show. Along came the spider and along went my money.",Along Came a Spider
253,bsullivan2,"same old movie, different cast",5,7 April 2001,"I saw Along Came A Spider and it just seemed like the same old detective-tries-to-find-bad-guy-using-clues-he-leaves-to-rescue-hostage movie.  Apart from Morgan Freeman, the characters just weren't very interesting.  Sure, there were a couple twists in the plot...but a twist means nothing if the story and characters aren't very interesting in the first place.  I think this movie needed a more creative plot that's never been done in these types of movies (kidnapping a government official's child is a bit too cleche) and more interesting characters (the villain seemed like an average man, not nearly as interesting as Anthony Hopkins in 'The Silence of the Lambs' or Kevin Spacey in 'Se7en').  The only thing I really like about this movie is the title.",Along Came a Spider
254,dazzle79,the maker of this film is an overachiever,2,17 August 2006,"Over the years, many average thrillers were made, and there is nothing wrong with that. They don't keep you on the edge of your seat, but you know what you can expect. Light entertainment and a good thrill from time to time.The problem with this movie is that, as an average thriller, it tries too hard to compete with such masterpieces as 'Seven' and 'The usual suspects'. If the writer kept the story simple and build up the tension till the end, the 'surprise ending' would actually be a surprise. Instead, he tries to overwhelm us with smart twists.Another problem is the truly extraordinary police-work. Cross doesn't need clues from the kidnapper, just a simple presume is enough for this supercop to do the right thing at just the right moment. For instance, he thinks the Russian kid has something to do with it, he goes over to see him, and bang, 5 minutes later the kidnapper is present. It is just ludicrous. With cops like him, there wouldn't be a single criminal loose on the streets, they would all be in jail.Instead of being an average thriller, this is just an overestimated would-be blockbuster.",Along Came a Spider

256,trapperb,big hope....silly plot,5,29 April 2001,"Going into this movie I had hope of something good coming out of film from early 2001.  Unfortunately the streak of bad movies is unbroken. If the holes in the plot were not so huge, I might have enjoyed this movie, but instead the plot screams of a screenwriter desperately trying to find a neat twist as the movie stumbles to a conclusion.  Instead what is delivered is a series of increasingly silly plot devices that leaves one thinking that this COULD have been a good movie. I hate it when I find myself asking why the character didn't do the obvious (well the movie would end for one thing), or how a character can be so smart one minute, and soooo stupid the next. Too bad...it had potential.",Along Came a Spider
257,angelawright1,Fans of the book will be disappointed,5,6 May 2002,"I read the book first and as most people know books are usually better than the movie.  Well having seen Kiss the Girls and reading the book after, I was not disappointed at all, I thought the movie stuck very closely to the book.  So I was expecting the same from this movie.  I was greatly disappointed, I started watching the movie and couldn't even finish, but eventually did finish the movie.  Gary Soneji the villian is nothing like the Gary Soneji of the book, although the actor cast for the part could have totally pulled off the true Gary.  Morgan Freeman, the brilliant actor he is, is just getting to old to play Alex Cross who is a middle age man having relationships with most of the women of the novels, and Morgan being older means having to leave that out of the movies, which actually takes away from the story.  I guess if you're looking for a suspenseful film this would be somewhat interesting, but as for fans of the book, a BIG disappointment.",Along Came a Spider
258,teresacmuschik,Poor book adaption,5,25 August 2021,"I'm just really disappointed in the adaption of the original book. The plot has so much turns and twists and also focuses on the mental state of mind of Gary Soneji. Unfortunately most of the plot wasn't included in the screenwriting and therefore, despite a good performance of Morgan Freeman, I have to give it only 5 stars!",Along Came a Spider
259,kevinjoel,"Far superior to ""Kiss The Girls""",8,26 September 2001,"A far more superior movie than ""Kiss the Girls"",this is perhaps Morgan Freeman's best role since playing Red in ""The Shawshank Redemption"".I was disappointed with Monica Potter in ""Head over Heels"",but am once again a fan after seeing her best acting to date in the role of Jezzie Flannigan. I thought this was an awesome thriller that completely surprised me when the movie reached its climax. A definate ""Must See""!",Along Came a Spider

262,crackd,Dim-witted nonsense about nothing ....,3,18 February 2008,"...unspiced by unwise ""life-observations"" freely offered by the Alex Cross character (Freeman) to the Jezzie Flannigan character (Potter). In this way the movie is perfectly symmetrical; meaningless insights embedded in a pointless story. The plot has very few twists  if by ""twists"" we mean the head remains connected, however tenuously, to the tail. A lot of strange stuff does happen (it's just not connected to anything that went before). My suspicion is that the writer got these ""ideas"" by throwing darts against the wall - and came up with the final surprise when one bounced off the board and hit him in the head. Monica Potter is absolutely lovely to watch, and Morgan Freeman is suitably grim. My guess is that the film made money, and so for the principals, was worth the week it took to film, and the ten minutes it took to write.",Along Came a Spider
263,joewroberts,Thriller,6,7 March 2009,"I am a fan of Morgan Freeman and he did not let me down in this film. Freeman plays the part of Alex Cross, a renowned criminal profiler who is lured out of his depressive state to help the FBI track down a kidnapper. Although extremely far fetched in parts, (password guessing included) there are some very clever scenes. My personal favourite is the scene with silver flask - reminds me of the third die hard movie. The film seems to flow smoothly and whilst not a complicated plot, it will keep you watching right until the end. Definitely a film you can only watch once unless you have a really bad memory. Michael Wincott plays a very good mad man whilst Freeman is at his cool calm best. Not the best thriller by any means but well worth a watch.",Along Came a Spider
264,cameronevansbball,This Is Along Came a Spider??,3,18 March 2009,"The entire plot of the great James Patterson thriller has been gutted and transformed in so many ways. The great psychopathic killer comes off more like a common kidnapper, main characters are missing (John Sampson, Cross's family) as well as major plot points. Other characters' names are changed as well as some of their identities. This movie might have been better if it was changed a bit more and marketed as a different story. So, why even 3 stars? Well, Morgan Freeman and some others are well-casted and the great plot twist stays the same. If you haven't read the book,you might enjoy it. But if you have read the book, stay away!!!!",Along Came a Spider
265,dilf,a great movie with a twist,10,6 March 2003,"I was enthralled in this movie. IT was on TV last night, I'd seen Kiss The Girls and was most impressed with that so I'd give it a try.Senator Hank Rose's daughter is kidnapped by her teacher Gary Soneji, from under the secret service's nose. Soneji decides that he will only deal with Alex Cross (Freeman). Here starts the game.This film had me captured from the word go, yes It has type cast Freeman slightly in his profiler/cop mode, but he is so good at it. Michael Wincott, who is probably best known for his appearance in the Crow, was fantastic as the kidnapper. The twists in the plot were very good and kept me on the edge of my seat.Well written and well acted a definate buy on DVD for me.",Along Came a Spider
266,Canadian_Girl14,Very good movie,9,7 April 2004,"This is a really good movie in my opinion.  If you like adventure and action movies, this movie is definitely for you.  It had a great plot and a twist at the end of the movie. If you ever have the chance to watch this movie, please do so.  I don't think you'll regret it! The story line is that a girl is kidnapped and a ex-detective must try to find her.  Along the road though are many events that give the movie a whole different angle. Even though the movie is pretty long it is very good and has quite a few good actors in it as well. Oh, and one more thing. Don't miss the beginning of the movie as you need some of the information given during that time of the move.  Well, that's all but I hope that you found this review helpful!",Along Came a Spider

268,crazymonkey8621,Along Came One of the Best Thriller in Years,10,18 July 2004,". Along Came a Spider .Shortly after this suspense thriller hit theaters, Bill Diehl from ABC exclaimed that this movie was ""a knockout with a surprise twist."" Wow, he was right.The movie alone had a great story. After his partner brutally died by falling down a dam, Alex Cross [Morgan Freeman] went into a stage of depression. However, the daughter of a semi-famous senator was kidnapped by her school teacher, Gary Soneji [Michael Wincott], so he went back in action investigating in this uniquely stunning movie.Soneji was a very creative man. After kidnapping Megan [Mika Boorem], he took her to his boat and locked her in a small room. It was in the boat that a major surprise unfolded - he revealed his 'true' identity. Because he changed his look, investigators were very confused.Soneji left clues for the detectives all over the place, including in the very classroom that he taught Megan in for two years. One clue lead to another until finally the detectives believed that everything is solved. That was where the fun begins.Spoilers are no fun, so I am going to let you watch the movie and find out what happens in the end. Believe me, there is a major twist in the end! This has to be one of the best thrilling movies I have seen in a long time. It combines a perfect story with great acting, unique settings, and superb directing. Even though this movie is rated R, I greatly believe that it is appropriate for anyone that could handle ""the Ring,"" ""Road to Perdition,"" ""Chronicles of Riddick,"" or ""Secret Window."" This movie is a must see, so take your family along for a thrilling ride!In the end, I give this movie a 10 / 10... it was a perfect movie in my standards. Enjoy!",Along Came a Spider

Both are good and quite entertaining, but the movie is not even close to following the the book. Morgan Freeman is a great actor, but he is nothing close to the Alex Cross of the book series.

Its really difficult to predict in the whole cast who really was the spider.But nevertheless the plot was perfectly placed as it should be and the movie is worth of money.On the other hand Monica Porter played her part really good, but the movie only deserves to be a one time thriller flick rather than a long run horse.You may find the movie a very predictable and not so different from the movies of the same genre but still Lee put all the efforts to have glued to your seats till the end.",Along Came a Spider

272,childbirthmcgraw,Laughably Bad,2,23 September 2006,"Terrible film. Laughable 'computer jargon' scattered around for no apparent reason, plus a vast number of incredibly tenuous 'clues' that are followed by the police that bear no logical connection to each other (look out for the 'picture missing on the wall' scene and try to follow the logic). Senator's daughter is seemingly a trained commando for some unfathomable reason. Female lead is so unrealistically good looking it's distracting and boring. Music is pretty bad.

273,legally_brunette890,disappointed reader,4,2 November 2005,"I read the book and finished a couple of days before i watched the film so the plot was freshly in my mind. The book was a fantastic read, but the movie didn't live up to my expectations. I think the book missed out on many of the key features of the best selling novel. I was disappointed but it is a good film if you haven't read the book, where as i did: i was disappointed. But i do praise the director because of his excellent portrayal of the book to film, and also the casting. The book spans an time length of 2-3 years: so if made into a film, it would be a very long film. The book character of Dr.Alex Cross, is very 'hard' and a tough cop, with a lot of attitude and has a close friend Sampson, who is very similar. But the film's character is a very softly spoken, polite man.Overall i was disappointed, but it is a very good film if you haven't read the film.",Along Came a Spider

Nothing on Netflix interested me so I tuned to regular TV. I started to flick through the channels trying to find a late night movie or something to watch. I ended up finding this movie and I read the description and clicked. It was about 3 minutes into the movie already so I rewound and found that I hadnt missed much. After I finished watching it was around midnight and I was really tired. This movie was not bad. It kept my interest all the way through(Then again its not that hard to keep my interest). I actually like this movie. It was interesting the plot was good and the main characters were really engaging. The plot twist towards the end though threw me off a bit because it felt like it came out of nowhere. Anyway, This movie wasn't the worst movie Ive ever watched(Avatar) and its not the best movie I've ever watched(Titanic).",Along Came a Spider
