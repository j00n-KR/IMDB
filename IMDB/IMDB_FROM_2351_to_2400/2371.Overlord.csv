0,Leofwine_draca,One of the better Nazi horror flicks,7,30 December 2019,"OVERLORD is another addition to the small but ever-growing subgenre of Nazi-themed horror movies, which usually involve zombies and the like. It's similar in plot and tone to FRANKENSTEIN'S ARMY but more mainstream and less grindhouse in feel, although it still proves a gritty and gruesome adventure. I think the idea of American paratroops facing zombie experiments during the D-Day invasion is a great one, so this had to handle the concept really badly for me not to enjoy it. However, it's all good. The main characters are interesting and generally likeable; the villains are nasty and scheming; the zombies themselves sufficiently icky and horrible. Extensive CGI is used to depict certain fiery moments and the effect is chaotic, which is as it should be. Despite copious bloodshed this goes down the action rather than horror route, and works well in that regard despite cliches popping up regularly. I enjoyed it.",Overlord
1,SnoopyStyle,well made B-movie,7,5 August 2019,"It's D-day. A squad of paratroopers are tasked with destroying a radio tower on top of a church. Their plane is shot down. After their leader gets shot by the Nazis and one steps on a landmine, four survivors remain. They find refuge with a scavenger named Chloe. The Nazis are experimenting on the locals at the church.It's a horror story within a historical event. It has a good amount of action and thrills. The characters are compelling. It's always nice to have Nazi villains. It may not be completely new. It is not trying to be break new ground. It's a well-made B-movie and that's commendable.",Overlord
2,Prismark10,World War Z,4,7 August 2019,Overlord should had been a fun sleazy Naziploitation horror film.The Walking Dead meets Private Ryan mash up. Unfortunately the film does not gel.It is an unpretentious low budget World War 2 horror film but it lacks zombies. It should had been heaving with the undead.As part of the D-Day invasion. Paratroopers are on a mission to destroy a radio tower in a church in France but their plane is shot down. The survivors are helped by a local woman who is pestered by a local Nazi chief for sex.The soldiers discover that the Nazis have been carrying out sinister experiments with the locals in the church. A mysterious serum can bring life back to the dead.It takes a while for the schlock horror film to liven up and is not nearly as fun as it set out to be. It needed the cheeky verve such as the scene where a nazi is despatched back to base on a motorcycle with a tape on his mouth and a grenade inside.,Overlord
3,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining War-Action-Horror B-Movie,7,22 June 2020,"On the eve of the D-Day, paratroopers are assigned to destroy a radio tower in a French village that is jamming the Allied communication. However, the airplanes are shot down by the Germans and only four paratroopers survive. The small squad composed by Edward ""Ed"" Boyce (Jovan Adepo), Lyle Tibbet (John Magaro) and Morton Chase (Iain De Caestecker) under the command of Corporal Lewis Ford (Wyatt Russell), who is specialized in demolition, stumbles upon the local Chloe Laurent (Mathilde Ollivier) in the woods and she guides the squad to the village. But soon Boyce discloses a secret Nazi experiment of resurrection and creation of soldiers with superhuman strength.""Overlord"" is an entertaining war-action-horror B-movie. The plot begins as a serious war drama film, with most of the paratroopers killed under attack in the airplanes, by German soldiers or landmines. When Boyce reaches the underground German laboratory, the plot turns into a zombie film. The conclusion is weak, with the duel of the super soldiers Ford and Wafner, performed by Pilou Asbæk. But it is worthwhile watching this funny movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Operação Overlord"" (""Overlord Operation"")",Overlord
4,nogodnomasters,Play as dirty as the enemy,7,1 March 2019,"The film starts out as a typical WWII movie. Troops are being flown over Europe prior to the D-Day invasion. They must take out a radio tower in a church, in a small French occupied town in order for the invasion to be successful. After taking flak, the plane breaks up and only a few survive. They are hidden by Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier). As it turns out the church is more than a radio tower. It has a lab performing re-animation experiments.This is slightly better than the average WWII zombie type horror. They at least attempt to create something realistic. Decent special effects make-up.Guide: F-word. Near sex. No nudity.",Overlord
5,kosmasp,War - what is it good for?,7,6 June 2019,"Don't get confused at the beginning when the movie lacks any color. It is supposed to set you in the mood. War yes, but also the time period this is playing in. You get World War 2 and a bunch of allies trying a tactical war move against the Nazi Germans.But this is no ordinary war movie. There is more to it and it has to do with the alleged (?) experiments the Nazis made. The question is more like what experiments did they do? Of course the movie takes liberty to say the least - it does not take prisoners though - well when it comes to violence that is. Because this is quite graphic. So you have been warned. Overall more than decent effort in the genre",Overlord
6,jboothmillard,Overlord,6,25 November 2018,"Mark Kermode was on the BBC News talking about this film, he said it is similar to From Dusk Till Dawn, it starts out one way, and slowly turns into something else, I was certainly intrigued, so I went to see it, produced by J.J. Abrams (Lost, Star Trek, Star Wars: The Force Awakens). Basically set during the Second World War, a paratrooper squad is sent to destroy a German radio tower in an old church, on the eve of D-Day, the 5th of June, 1944. Their plane is shot down before they can reach their target, leaving five apparent survivors, Corporal Ford (Wyatt Russell, Kurt's son) and soldiers Boyce (Jovan Adepo), Tibbet (John Magaro), Chase (Iain De Caestecker), and Dawson (Jacob Anderson). Dawson is killed stepping on a landmine, the team continues onward, and they run into French woman Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier) who agrees to take them to her village, where the radio tower is located. Chloe lives with her eight-year-old brother Paul (Gianny Taufer) and her aunt (Meg Foster), who has been disfigured by Nazi experiments taking place in the church. Tibbet and Chase leave to check the scheduled rendezvous site, while the remaining soldiers are forced to hide in the attic when a Nazi patrol inspects the house. The Nazi troops leave, while S.S. Hauptsturmführer Wafner (Pilou Asbæk) stays and tries to rape Chloe, Boyce attacks him, and the soldiers take him prisoner. Trying to reach the rendezvous point, Boyce witnesses Nazi soldiers burning disfigured village residents with flamethrowers. He is nearly caught by a dog and forced to hide in a truck carrying dead corpses, including killed paratroopers. Taken inside the Nazi base, Boyce learns of the various experiments taking place in a laboratory, most using a mysterious liquid compound the Nazis discovered by distilling an ancient tar from under the church through human bodies. Boyce takes a sample of the serum and rescues captured fellow paratrooper Rosenfeld (Dominic Applewhite), they manage to escape the castle. Back at the attic, Wafner refuses to explain what the serum is when questioned, Ford severely beats him. When the squad prepare to assault the church, Wafner attempts to escape, shooting and killing Chase, Boyce is driven to use the serum on Chase after his death. The serum brings Chase to life, but he quickly begins to mutate, showing inhuman strength, a resistance to gunfire, and turns hostile, forcing Boyce to crush Chase's head until he is dead. During this chaos, part of Wafner's face is blown off by Ford in a shootout, he escapes and takes Paul as a hostage. There is a deadline for the clock tower to be destroyed, time is running out, but Boyce insists to Ford that destroying the laboratory is their priority. Rosenfeld and Tibbet create a distraction at the main entrance, while Ford, Boyce, and Chloe enter the base through the sewers Boyce previously used to escape, Boyce and Ford plant the explosives while Chloe rescues Paul. Despite warning from scientists that it has not been tested on living subjects, Wafner has injected himself with experimental serums, causing him to mutate and driving him increasingly insane. Boyce distracts Wafner, while the injured Ford injects himself with another sample of the serum, the two mutated men aggressively fight each other, until Wafner is forced down a pit. Ford forces Boyce to leave him behind and finish setting off the dynamite, Boyce successfully blows up the radio tower and the laboratory, escaping as the church and radio tower collapse behind him. Following the radio tower destruction, Boyce reports to their superiors that Ford planted the bombs inside rather than outside the church to ensure it was destoyed, he chooses not to mention the serum or the laboratory as he believes neither side should possess the serum. The military accepts this story and the soldiers are informed that they will be reassigned to another company as the war continues. Also starring Bokeem Woodbine as Sergeant Rensin and Erich Redman as Dr. Schmidt. So for the first thirty minutes or so this seems like your standard World War II drama, but as soon as you have dead bodies reanimated into indestructible zombie-like maniacs it becomes much darker, Asbaek really revels being the dastardly Nazi villain, the story is pretty easy to follow, a band of brothers on a mission to destroy German communications, but what makes it stand out is the shocking violence, many body parts are bloodied and torn apart, this only adds to the well-paced tension and thrills, all in all it is a very nasty but worthwhile wartime horror. Good!",Overlord
7,BA_Harrison,Overlord isn't over the top enough.,6,10 June 2019,"Overlord opens in blistering style as a bomber full of allied troops prepare for an important mission that will help ensure the success of the D-Day landings. As the plane is pummelled by enemy fire, bullets ripping through the fuselage and flak taking its toll, the men attempt to remain calm, ready to parachute into German occupied France. It's an exhiliarating, adrenaline rush of an opening, but all too brief, and one that the remainder of the film simply fails to match in terms of excitement.After such a spectacular start, I hoped that the film would continue with the 'all guns blazing' approach, but much of the action seems frustratingly restrained. Yes, there is gore, and yes, there are zombies (of a sort), but the bulk of the film does little to push the envelope: there is little here that we haven't seen before in other so-so examples of the genre such as Outpost and Frankenstein's Army. Much of the movie sees the heroes hiding out in an attic, which isn't that interesting, even when one of them returns from the dead and goes crazy. Also proving less than thrilling is the exploration of a Nazi lab complex by Private Boyce (Jovan Adepo): the soldier finds a few disturbing experiments, including a talking woman's head attached to a spinal column, but nothing that qualifies as a stretch of the imagination.The final act-the attack on the German stronghold-is full of explosions, gunfire, and gore, which is mindlessly entertaining enough, but it still lacks that spark to set it apart from similarly themed films. In the end, I still prefer the lunacy of cheapo Iron Sky knock-off Nazis At The Centre Of The Earth (AKA Bloodstorm) over this bigger-budgeted J.J. Abrams produced effort.6.5/10, rounded down to 6 for altering history to be more politically correct by having a black sargeant in command of an integrated unit, which would never have happened in WWII. Way to go Hollywood!",Overlord
8,paul_haakonsen,"Not so much a zombie movie, but enjoyable nonetheless...",7,9 February 2019,"I never got around to watching ""Overlord"" when it was showing in the cinema, so I had to wait for it to be released as a physical hardcopy. The waiting was a bit long.Once the movie ended, I must admit that I was left with a feeling of 'was that truly it?'. Because I had been told that this was an amazing zombie movie centered on a World War II storyline. So what was there not to like about it? But I felt somewhat disillusioned once the movie ended, as it wasn't all that great as I had been lead to believe.So why not? Well, for starters, where were the zombies? All that there was, was some scientifically altered French villagers experimented on by the Germans, brought back to life with superhuman abilities in a way. Zombies? Well, not so much as in the traditional sense.Right, well with that being said and out of the way, then I must say that the storyline in the movie was really interesting, and the way that the story was told made me feel like I was right there alongside with the Americans. I love the way that the story was told here, because it was really nerve-wrecking and intense. It had the ingredients of both a war movie and a supernatural thriller with a hint of horror to it.The acting in the movie was good, and I really enjoyed watching Wyatt Russell (playing Ford) and Pilou Asbæk (playing Wafner) in the movie, because they really carried the movie so phenomenally well with their performances. Especially Pilou Asbæk, because he was so amazingly well-cast for the role of the German officer.One thing that almost had me clapping my hands was the fact that the Germans actually spoke German in the movie, and not just English with a horrible assumed German thick accent thrown over it. That kind of authenticity really adds such a layer of enjoyment in a movie for me.The sets, costumes and props used throughout the movie was really good, because it really felt like you where there in the action, in a French village during World War II. There definitely was a great feel of authenticity to it.The special effects and make-up in the movie was good too. Which definitely helped to bring the movie alive and make it believable on the screen.I am rating ""Overlord"" a seven out of ten stars, because it was definitely an action-packed and adrenaline-filled movie, despite it turning out to not be a typical zombie movie - which I had expected.",Overlord
9,Coventry,Re-Animating Private Ryan,6,6 October 2021,"Of all the possible genre-combos, my personal least favorite mixture is horror and war movie. Horror is war, but war is not necessarily horror. There honestly only exist one or two movies that successfully blend genuine horror with devastating war epics, and even though the concept of Nazi-Zombies admittedly sounds cool, only ""Shock Waves"" is remotely worth watching. So, despite the fairly high rating and the involvement of wonder-boy J. J. Abrams (as a producer), I was rather skeptical with my expectations towards ""Overlord"".Let's start off with the good news, and confirm ""Overlord"" is a surprisingly good and entertaining film. However, I do believe this is because the film is 80% war-movie (young air force platoon on a mission to bomb a German radio tower in Nazi-occupied France prior to the Normandy invasion on D-Day), and barely 20% horror flick (the same platoon stumbling on a secret Nazi-lab where a type of Mengele conducts experiments with dead bodies and a sort of re-animation serum). The WWII footage is impressive, shockingly realistic, and explicit. If you manage to accept the historical inaccuracy (like black soldiers and even sergeants-in-command), you might find ""Overlord"" similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"". Young and naïve soldiers are literally being dropped in overseas hell to fulfil a mission that is practically suicidal. They are confronted with agony and hopelessness. The horror aspects are derivative, but nevertheless entertaining to watch. Fallen Nazi soldiers resurrect as indestructible super-monsters with half of their faces blown off and their veins almost bursting out their necks & arms. It's undemanding, over-the-top fun, plain and simple.",Overlord
10,Hey_Sweden,Entertaining schlock done on a big budget.,7,17 July 2019,"It's D-Day, and a small group of American soldiers survive a parachute drop into enemy territory. Their job is to destroy a radio-jamming tower vital to Nazis. True to form, the Nazis reveal themselves to be incredibly monstrous as always, as they are conducting experiments within this same tower: hideous genetic experiments that mutate human bodies.""Overlord"" isn't particularly imaginative or innovative, and its characters induced some frustration in this viewer at times, but overall it's a pretty amusing feature. It plays, for a while, like a traditional WWII ""men on a mission"" yarn, then drops the sci-fi and horror elements into the scenario with a jolt. It has a lot of energy, and a lot of intensity, although perhaps too much digital effects work for some peoples' tastes. The characters are a mixed bag, but Jovan Adepo does alright as a wide-eyed soldier / moral centre, and Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn) is compelling as the no-nonsense, all-business corporal trying to keep the mission on track. He gets to be quite badass, as does Mathilde Ollivier as a plucky French villager taking care of a younger brother and a sickly aunt. (Meg Foster cameos as the aunt, but you'd never know it was her; she's barely seen, and covered in makeup meant to convey the effects of these insidious Nazi experiments.)Few villains are as easy to boo as Nazis; they just make for such despicable antagonists. The main rotter whom the heroes must deal with is the slimy Wafner (Pilou Asbaek). Soon after we're introduced to him, the audience is going to be primed and ready to see him buy the farm in a big way.Despite the plethora of the aforementioned CGI effects, there are some good practical makeup effects as well. It's a hoot to see bodies get deformed after various unfortunates become victims of the experiments. (This may call to mind the John Carpenter classic ""The Thing"", which of course starred Wyatts' dad.)Agreeably ridiculous entertainment; as others have said, it's like a mega-budget, amped-up version of an old-school Nazisploitation flick.Seven out of 10.",Overlord
11,CinemaSerf,Over-bored!,6,18 October 2020,"An American airborne squadron are tasked with bombing a crucial radio mast on the eve of D-Day so as to terminally cripple communications between the Nazi High Command and their troops in Normandy. Their plane is shot down and they must make their way through miles of enemy territory to disable their target. What awaits them though, is the result of some hideous Nazi human experimentation that could turn the tide and secure victory for Hitler. It's an amalgam of horror film and war film and does neither particularly effectively; the acting and writing vie with each other for the mediocrity prize of 2018 and after a while it all just smacks of a lack of originality that, granted, some amazing pyrotechnics just cannot overcome. Sorry, but I wouldn't bother if I were you....",Overlord
12,zardoz-13,An Above-Average Mash-Up of World War II Movies and Horror Chillers,7,22 November 2018,"The people who made ""Overlord"" should have taken a refresher course in World War II history. Although I have no idea who deserves blame for the primary anachronism in casting African-Americans as armed military combatants, surely ""Star Trek"" producer J.J. Abrams, ""Son of a Gun"" director Julius Avery, ""Hunger Games"" scenarist Billy Ray and/or ""Revenant"" scribe Mark L. Smith should have known better. African-Americans never fought alongside Caucasians in combat units. The segregationist Pentagon prohibited such integration until the outbreak of hostilities in the Korean War. Indeed, African-Americans participated in World War II, as movies like ""Red Ball Express"" (1952) and ""Red Tails"" (2012) have documented. Meantime, the ""Overlord"" filmmakers could have dreamed up other ways to believably intergrate the two African-Americans into the fireworks. Anybody who has seen Guy Hamilton's belated ""Guns of Navarone"" sequel ""Force 10 from Navarone"" (1978) can see how credibly Carl Weathers was integrated into the action without rewriting history. Furthermore, it will probably come as a severe shock to these filmmakers that Allied soldiers didn't have to salute their superiors in the field until Hitler's henchmen signed the peace treaty. I don't know for a complete certainty if U.S. paratroopers were issued only carbines with folding stocks as their chief armament. Nevertheless, bailing out of an airplane with an unwieldy M1 rifle must have been a chore. If you can overlook these obvious flaws, ""Overload"" qualifies as an above-average, mission-oriented World War II epic with a side plot involving ghoulish experiments to forge the ideal Nazi super-soldier. I hesitate to classify these super-soldiers as 'zombies' because they can survive head wounds and keep on fighting. One delicious line of dialogue delivered by the villainous Nazi officer that alludes to these immortal soldiers is heightens the irony: ""A thousand-year Reich needs thousand-year soldiers."" Of course, the age range of the audience bound to behold this hell-raising, genre-hybrid thriller probably doesn't care about preserving historical authenticity.Happily, Australia helmer Julius Avery directs this war picture with enough gusto and grenades to make the grade. The opening scene aboard a C-47 transport plane flying our heroes into German-occupied France on the eve of the Allied D-Day invasion evokes memories of ""Saving Private Ryan"" as German anti-aircraft batteries blast the bejesus out of the fuselage. Most of the outfit dies horribly while the guys who were still alive had to scramble to jump as the engines of the plane burst into flames. Avery and his scenarists do a competent job of fleshing out their characters. Corporal Ford (Wyatt Russell of ""Everybody Wants Some"") isn't a part of the unit that wings its way into France. He has a record of insubordination and doesn't make friends easily because--as he points out to another gullible soldier: ""Friends die."" Ultimately, he carries out his mission. Along the way, he takes one hell of a beating, after his buddies and he enter a church that the Germans are using not only to conduct their nefarious experiments but also a house a powerful radio transmitter. This strategic transmitter could hamper American planes flying air support for the invasion. Consequently, Ford and five surviving paratroopers contend with a Nazi-stronghold established in a church. Raw recruit Private Boyce (Jovan Adepo of ""Fences"") finds a way into the heavily fortified church; he rides into the church aboard a truck heaped with corpses. Luckily, he sneaks into the church without arousing attention and then rescues one of his fellow paratroopers, Rosenfeld (Dominic Applewhite of ""Les Misérables""), who the enemy had promptly captured no sooner than he had landed and had prepared for those hellish experiments. Initially, odious German commanding officer Wafner (Pilou Asbæk of ""Ghost in the Shell"") doesn't know what the experiments are about, despite having rounded up several innocent French men and women to serve as guinea pigs. He has enraged a pretty slip of a French girl, Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier of ""The Misfortunes of François Jane""), because his men took her aunt and subjected her to those dreadful Nazi doctors. She winds up helping Corporal Ford and Private Boyce as they set about to blow up the German radio tower.Altogether, ""Overlord"" ranks as borderline tolerable action movie, but nowhere as entertaining as it could have been with humor laden over the violence.",Overlord
13,grantss,"Not bad, and surprisingly so",6,19 September 2019,"D-Day, 6 June 1944. A platoon of US paratroopers enters a village to discover that there is a German laboratory nearby. The Germans are developing a serum that turns their troops into indestructible super-soldiers. The paratroopers set out to destroy the laboratory.Not bad. Once I learned that this was as much a horror movie as a war movie, I set my expectations quite low. The first few scenes didn't help much either, as the film didn't seem very gritty or overly realistic, militarily.However, from the moment the paratroopers enter the village there is a fair amount of intrigue and mystery, and a fair amount of action. The action is okay: it has some clichés and gung ho elements but mostly works very well.In addition, the horror side isn't overdone and is even quite plausible.Ultimately, hardly Citizen Kane but still quite interesting and entertaining.",Overlord

But evil Nazi science is carrying out experiments in the church basement.Trailers give the impression that this is a horror movie with a WWII setting. It is actually a WWII ""against the odds mission"" movie with a relatively small amount of horror-oriented sci-fi turning up towards the end.I confess to being somewhat disappointed. I was expecting - and looking forward to - something with far stronger horror overtones. Not that there was anything wrong with it, but I thought I was buying boots, and I got waterproof shoes. The 18 certificate (in the UK) added to the mis-selling - I've seen 15s which have had stronger material than this, and I can't see why it was an 18.Plus there was stuff in it which annoyed me. How many rural French churches have miles of dungeons, cellars, cells, laboratories and silos beneath them?

The dialogue's underwritten and weak; and the lead character Boyce doesn't have the personality or charisma to carry the spotlight.

And a little more inventive.Scenery gets chewed beyond recognition, and after a breathtaking opening scene, even though we are awaiting the super soldiers, you can't help but feel that the films flow has dropped a gear.But it's a fun, gory romp with lots going for it, and again, hopefully more horror film makers will have the cahones to go all out, because my gosh, there is a market for them",Overlord

So I waited a while before plugging it in the player and go watching it, why, because I have seen so many positive reviews on flicks but mostly their pure propaganda or like people running out of theatres and stuff.Starts as a pure war flick it takes over half the flick before you see what is going on underground and what experiments rae being done. But once it's shown, it's indeed gory, but not over the top.After all, pure entertainment, but a bit overhyped because it really take some time before the gorehounds are fed. Still, not for everybody due that reason. Original it isn't, remember Dead Snow (2009). But when you have JJ Abrams behind your flick you know it will be seen.

19,deloudelouvain,Much better than I expected.,8,8 February 2019,"I don't know why people have to compare Overlord with video games like Band Of Brothers or Castle Wolfenstein. Even if it is slightly based on a computer game you never have the feeling you're in a first-person shooter video game so it doesn't matter that you compare it with it. The only thing that matters is that the movie has to be entertaining because in this genre that's what you're looking for, easy entertainment. And entertaining it was, at least to me. Nice cinematography, a fair amount of suspense, a not so bad story, and actors that gave the best of themselves. As for the horror part I thought it was well made so no complaints about that either. Overlord is one of those movies that you love or hate and you can count me in the first category.",Overlord
20,siderite,"Like so many Bad Robot movies, it's decent but overhyped",7,5 February 2019,"I really hate the marketing system for these movies. You hear about Overlord from so many different sources, way before you get to see it, then you watch it and can't enjoy it even if it is a decent movie because your expectations are all out of wack. So let me dispel some myths first. If this was a high budget film, it didn't really show. That doesn't mean it feels cheap, it only means that I've seen a lot of films and even TV shows that feature the effects and sets shown in it. So if you go in expecting a special effects extravaganza you're gonna be disappointed. Then it is not a zombie film. It's a Nazi experiment movie and many people instantly associate this with zombies because it is a trope, but no, not a zombie film. Which is good, because the story doesn't feel stale. And then there is the gore factor. I am at the age where I don't really care if there is gore or not and don't get the kick from human body harm. But there wasn't a lot of gore. It was just right. This is not a gore fest.As for what the movie is, it's a story reminiscent of Dog Soldiers, if anything, with bits of Inglorious Basterds and Castle Wolfenstein sprinkled in. Now Dog Soldiers became a cult classic in its own right and so Overlord might too. If you watch it, you will see actors you know acting well on well done sets, with seamless effects and a classic (and just as simpleminded) good Allies vs evil Nazis story. But that's all it is. It's not the second coming of Christ or anything. Just a decent film amidst a lot of hype.",Overlord
21,thesar-2,"O'Lordy, It's Captain Brightburn",7,14 July 2019,"While this is already a good movie, the best part wasn't even in the movie. The Cloverfield Rumors weren't true.I had heard that JJ was up to his stupid tricks AGAIN and was going to turn this into Cloverfield: Monster Mission SS. I loved the first Cloverfield and loved ""part 2,"" if you can call 10 Cloverfield Ln. a sequel, even more. But, since it worked for JJ to turn one completely separate and unrelated project into his Cloverfield Universe, he did it again with the so godawful Cloverfield Paradox, I vowed not to see Overload. Thank God, the rumors, which spread like tumors, were made up.Now, that all said, this action packed, half WWII journey/half horror film, isn't a perfect movie and wouldn't have been slaughtered by adding in the Cloverfield brand. I'm just glad it didn't.Indiana Jones hates Nazis and now, with good reasons. They're not just despicable, horrible rapists and over-lords (see?) of a small village, they're creating our worst fears to do what Nazis do best: cause havoc and raise hell. Will the surviving members of a shot down plane, a strong and vengeful resident and a kid with a Baseball fetish take down the most corrupt German army?I'm not a war-movie lover. In fact, it takes great convincing for me to see one. The promise of this being a well-made movie, the second half chock-full of horror and it's actually not a Cloverfield movie made me see it. But, being what it is, it still took me 3 starts/stops to complete.I'm happy I did, though, as with all war-movies and me: I'll probably never see this again. I hate war and even with the best shot war movie, it's hard for me to watch such stupidity.Now, if you like war movies AND horror...I'd highly check this out.

23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Call Of Wolfenstein: Overlord,6,11 November 2018,"'Overlord (2018)' certainly has tonal issues, often being properly horrific but seeming to want to inject humour at the most inopportune of moments. It's also quite schlocky essentially every time it tries to do anything more traditionally 'war movie'-esque. This is especially prevelant in the moments where it wants us to believe its heroes are being overtly and defiantly heroic, in spite of their army-given orders or previously quite unlikable (sometimes contemptible) character-traits, or in the times where it tries to tie its events directly into the narrative of the overall Second World War - which is actually quite disturbing not in its slightly jingoistic and strangely campy ending but in its undercurrent of Nazi experimentation, something that did really occur to an extent perhaps less sensational but far more despicable than what's seen here. Really, the issues come down to the writing, which isn't as nuanced as it perhaps thinks it is but also isn't as straight-forwardly 'genre-specific' as it perhaps ought to have been. There are times when the flick works, though, which mainly come when it slips straight into the fantastical, horror territory where it feels most at home and, indeed, adept. Here, it puts the historical context further into the background than before, using it as a backdrop for a sort of silly but played-straight science-fiction flick that actually works well when it tries to scare and make squirm. The visuals are pretty much universally good and, aside from a couple of unnecessarily glorified gore-shots, the violence is presented as believably painful and properly gruesome, too. Ultimately, this makes for a flawed experience that's at its best when it just lets the viscera fly like it is slick, big-budgeted and generally very well put-together grindhouse-bound 'trash art'. 6/10",Overlord
24,ThomasDrufke,What a Ride,8,18 November 2018,"It's inherently easy to hate the Nazi's. Everything they represented as was as close to pure evil as we may ever get on this earth. So brilliantly, Overlord makes them even more despicable as we find out in this ""version"" of the Nazi's, they are experimenting on humans with a drug that enhances people into roided out monsters who are extremely hard to kill. On one hand, it's a zombie/thriller/gorefest, and on the other, it's a World War 2 drama. Both extremely effective, and always entertaining. The one valid complaint is that the characters are not drawn out or developed as much as they should be, but director Julius Avery makes up for it with his beautifully detailed visceral directing. Overlord is one of the best films of the year.8.8/10",Overlord
25,Cineanalyst,First-Person Shooter,5,12 November 2020,"""Overlord"" is video-game styled Naziploitation. There's no sex, really, but it's violent, gory and mercifully impossible to take seriously. There's some CGI spectacle early on, including a thrilling, spinning paradrop shot. (I like the old-fashioned logo and credits, too.) Then, the first-person shooter goes off about his mission, gets distracted by subplots, saves the princess and, inevitably, fights the boss. The character who's a writer is killed early on, which is apt, I suppose. The thing basically writes itself with its video-game plotting and otherwise lifting from movie clichés. It hardly matters, I suppose, that it ignores America's history of racial segregation. It's not a historical war picture--American soldiers good, shoot Nazis, save French girls. It's that simple.Another supporting role is of a cameraman, and his fate may be just as telling. I like to keep track of movies that feature characters that are writers or that share a photographic perspective (and I use the Letterboxd tabs to do so), as such is oft employed for interesting reflexivity. That's not the case here. ""Overlord"" is not for intellectual engagement. I'm surprised it wasn't based on a video game and am even more nonplussed if it hasn't been made into one yet. I wouldn't play it. I find that junk personally disorienting and ultimately destructive, but I do enjoy mindless entertainment now and again--all the more mindless because it's not even interactive like a video game.By the way, I viewed ""Overlord"" because I was led to believe it had zombies, and I've been seeking out such movies as part of my search for virus and pandemic-related pictures. The Nazi experiments here aren't what I would consider to be zombies, though. Oh well, guess I don't need to think about that, either.",Overlord
26,cricketbat,"Dull, yet brutal",6,12 February 2019,"Overlord starts out like a typical World War 2 movie and, to be honest, it takes a little too long to get into the supernatural part of the story.

27,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,12 February 2019,"OverlordZombies never allied with the Nazis during WWII because even zombies aren't that inhuman.However, this horror movie depicts a history where the world's worst teamed up.The day before D-Day a squadron of US paratroopers (Jovan Adepo, Wyatt Russell, John Magaro) are secretly dispatched over France to dispense of a German radio tower. But as the regiment attempts to complete their mission, they stumble upon a church where they discover the Nazis are conducting experiments on the locals. With time running out and the dead coming back to life, the soldiers must make the ultimate sacrifice to save humanity.While the idea of meshing the two powerhouse villains has been explored many times before in cinema, this cartoony American addition from producer J. J. Abrams doesn't bring anything all that new to the genre besides a few impressive scenes early on.Furthermore, zombie veterans would just ruin Remembrance Day ceremonies.

It started with a great and horrifying action set piece, which kinda reminded me of ""Saving Private Ryan"". But as the story progressed, i was a little bit disappointed - instead of expected zombie movie i got monster movie - no further spoiler. Nevertheless action scenes were very well made - director made a very job in here. Acting was OK / nothing special.Overall, ""Overlord"" is not bad movie for those who enjoy monster movies.

29,Platypuschow,Overlord: Enjoyable but contrived,6,4 March 2019,"I was excited by the trailer but within my circles I'd heard only extremes regarding its quality. There was the camp that hated it and there was the camp that loved it, absolutely nobody in between.It tells the story of a band of soldiers during world war II who are tasked with destroying a German communications tower. During their mission however they discover that deep within the bowels of the earth the Nazi military base houses dark secrets.Immediately I was struck with how good it all looked, the opening visuals were fantastic and that right there made a fantastic first impression. It develops the characters nicely and presents a threat that I personally like. This isn't a Nazi zombie movie as many have suggested but it's of that general ilk and there is something about it that just provides further chills.The cast wisely have a roster of relative unknowns, in fact the only person I really recognized was Iain ""Agents of Shield"" De Caestecker and he's far from the movies leading man.So when all hell breaks loose does it deliver? Well it looks the part I can't dispute that but honestly it goes full on Hollywood for the most part. Every trite trope and generic expectation you'll have it meets and then some.Despite this it's enjoyable enough take your brain out entertainment. It's big, it's violent, it's gory and it's dumb and sometimes that's all you need.I can confidently say I'd have written Overlord as a very different film, but what we got is a brainless horror/action flick that you can do a lot worse than.The Good:Some great visualsDecent conceptThe Bad:Stock screamA few really poorly thought out elementsGeneric Hollywood finale",Overlord

32,paulclaassen,Simply awesome!!,8,2 April 2019,"Wow, I can't stress enough how much fun I've had with this movie. Man, it was insane!!From the intense opening scene to the final climatic battle, there really never is a dull (or uninteresting) moment. This film was captivating from the very first second up until that moment when the credits rolled. This is the best action-adventure horror film I've seen since 'Aliens' way back in 1986.The visuals and action sequences are impressive, and the acting is very, very good. The film features stand-out make-up effects reminiscent to John Carpenter's 'The Thing'. It simply is mind blowing! Some of the scenes are downright gory and cringe worthy (in a horrifically good way!!). The film also has some shockingly good war scenes, with a lot of depth and emotion. This film is a rollercoaster of action, adventure and horror with several genres blended seamlessly to create a truly unique movie experience! I loved every second of this film! This unpredictable film surprised me in so many ways.I liked every single character, from Wyatt Russell as the leader, to Jovan Adepo as Boyce (man, this guy was really good!). Pilou Asbaek was excellent as the well set-up villain, Wafner, and Mathilde Ollivier was just as good as the only female hero, Chloe.'Overlord' is often billed as a zombie film. This is not correct, though. This is an action-adventure horror with zombie elements, but not a zombie film. I'd also rather refer to them 'undead' instead of zombies, as they do not bear any zombie trademarks. From a war film point of view, the action scenes are INCREDIBLE! This was simply awesome!!",Overlord
33,cruise01,Intense action and horror set up but was a little short with the undead.,8,10 November 2018,"Overlord (4 out of 5 stars).Overlord may be overhyped but is quite entertaining and exciting if you are looking for a loud, shoot em up action, and a mutated nazi becoming a super soldier. The film is like 90 % war thriller and 10% of the good guys facing against some mutated soldier. If you are expecting a zombie war movie. You will be disappointed. Leave the expectations at the door and enjoy the film as it is which is an action thriller.The film begins with a big cinematic action sequence of paratroopers being sent to Germany to destroy their radio tower that is located on a church. The planes are shot down. And the remaining soldiers that survived are Boyce (Jovan Adepo), Ford (Wyatt Russell), Tibbet (John Magaro), and Chase (Iain De Caestecker). They run into a French villager Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier) who brings them in into her aunts home. Were they spend most of the movie trying to plan on what is in the other side of radio tower's walls. After seeing the Nazi's bringing out villagers that look deformed and sick and burning them. When they go inside the tower, they discover some disturbing experiment as they are trying to reanimate the dead and make super soldiers.The opening sequence was intense. It is loud and the intensity really put you on the edge. Seeing the paratroopers getting anxious, as they're afraid of being shot. When they land, they not only have to worry about the Germans patrolling. They have to watch out for land mines, and the sight of seeing dead bodies hanging on the trees. The film is exciting. It does slow down in the second act of the movie were they spend a great amount of time in Chloe's home. Trying to plan their next move. While Boyce sneaks into their compound and discovers these disturbing experiments. Were you see a decapitated head roll their eyes. And strange groans in cells. It does get a bit scary. And the third act picks up the pace with characters setting up bombs in the compound and fighting against the Germans and a mutated captain soldier chasing them down.Jovan Adepo was great giving the scared performance. Wyatt Russell was good as the hard personality corporal. Mathilde Ollivier gave a bada** performance as a civilian villager. John Magaro as the loud mouth trooper. And Iain De Caestecker as the photographer and a bit of a soft personality as a soldier. And Pilou Asbaek as Wafner the Nazi's captain was a great villain.I expected a little more with the movie. It tried playing it safe from overdoing it. A great action sequence in the beginning. A slow build up in the middle and a climatic battle with two mutated super soldiers and the bad soldiers. I was expecting more of a battle with the undead. Which would not hurt the movie at all. And the film was a little limited with its gore.Overall, Overlord is a good war horror film. It is intense and has some scary disturbing moments. The action sequences are good. The cast is great. But Julius Avery's direction played it safe for its own good. It could have been scarier with more undead showing up than waiting to see the two in the last 15 minutes of the movie.",Overlord
34,zkonedog,Bad Robot Steps Out Of Its Comfort Zone,7,14 November 2018,"If a film from J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions is in theaters, I will likely be there to support it. I love his mystery box style of filmmaking, and the way he develops characters and creates engaging mystery/drama in movies. With ""Overlord"", however, Bad Robot really takes a step outside its own comfort zone or usual genres. The early results are surprisingly positive, if perhaps a little confusing in terms of expectations.For a basic plot summary, ""Overlord"" begins as a traditional WWII flick. On the eve of D-Day, a group of American soldiers parachute into France to knock out a Nazi radio tower located at a strategic church position. Led by Ford (Wyatt Russell) and nominally focusing on young Boyce (Jovan Adepo), the small group enlist the help of French native Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier) to get them to the tower. What they find inside, however, is far more strange and horrific than a radio control base.What's a little humorous to me about ""Overlord"" is that even in trying to make a ""zombie WWII"" action/adventure piece, Bad Robot can't help but instill its own formula into the proceedings. The characters here are given quite awhile to develop (sometimes mores than even traditional WWII dramas!), and it isn't until the final third of the film where viewers are given the Nazi zombie shoot-em-up promised by the trailers. The ""mystery box"" is opened wide eventually, but the fact that it exists at all in this genre is interesting. These are all things that made me enjoy the experience more than the genre would usually appeal to my cinema tastes.Only helping matters is that some of the more ""peripheral"" aspects of the film are very supportive of the main plots/characters. The makeup effects are incredible, a few camera shots really stand out, and the atmosphere as the weirdness cranks up in that final third is legitimately creepy. I can't particularly say that the acting was all that great (or noticeable) apart from Adepo's standout performance, but such depth probably wouldn't be supported by this type of filmmaking style anyway.About the closest comp I can give is playing Wolfenstein 3D on my PC back in the early 90s! It's a war/sci-fi mashup, and that combination probably isn't going to shoot to the top of any charts. Considering that ""Overlord"" is the first rated-R effort from Bad Robot, I'd have to consider it a success. Personally, I'll always be more drawn to the more mysterious Cloverfield-type fare, but this one indeed kept me entertained all the way through (something that, say, a James Bond film doesn't necessarily even do these days).",Overlord
35,Floated2,Some fun but nothing special,5,20 August 2019,"Overlord has been praised by critics last year and although wasn't a big box office success, seemed to have found a way through word of mouth. This movie is quite different than others one have seen, with its use of World War aspects mixed with zombies and some gore violence.In all this felt like a B-movie as it is but with a high Hollywood budget. Where we don't really care for it's characters but want suspense and action thrills. The lead character of Boyce was too much of a ""do the right thing"" guy and the other character of Ford wasn't any better or likeable.Overlord isn't bad but in general nothing too special. It does have an intriguing concept and has its moments but in the end isn't as great as hyped up to be.",Overlord
36,eddie_baggins,A box-office dud destined for cult status,6,13 March 2019,"At one stage thought to be some form of Cloverfield sequel/prequel, thanks to the association with wonder producer J.J Abrams and his production company Bad Robot, Overlord is very much a film set in its own universe that takes us on a gore filled World War 2 set adventure to occupied France, as a small collection of American soldiers discover that German run labs are not the ideal place to spend time in.Directed by upcoming Australian filmmaker Julius Avery whose previous film Son of a Gun showed much promise, Overlord does a lot with its relatively small budget of $38 million as we are thrust into the D-Day invasion and follow a collection of paratroopers on a mission to destroy a German radio bunker set up at the base of an old church building.It's not being over the top when you say the first 10 - 20 minutes of Avery's film are some of the most thrilling and dazzling of the last 12 months, with the audience given barely a moment to breathe as the films stunning opening set-piece takes place and we launch out of an under fire carrier plane with Jovan Adepo's Boyce and his fellow soldiers.If Overlord had somehow managed to keep this pace, intensity and style up, Avery's film would be a dead-set undeniable gem but sadly the film unleashes its best too early as the film around it, whilst often entertaining and gloriously over the top, just never quite delivers the thrills, spills and chills like you'd wished it had done.Truly becoming the cinematic equivalent of the famous Wolfenstein video game series (which must've been a direct inspiration for this tale), Overlord's mix of war time action, sci-fi, straight up visceral horror (found within the Nazi's underground labs) and thriller doesn't always hold up, even if it's great to see a film of this ilk play it completely straight with Overlord forgoing laughs as there's no winking to the camera as the nefarious goings on begin to take hold.It's a gore-filled and claret flowing exercise, with Avery clearly at home with the action side of things and a little less so at character building, with side players like Wyatt Russell's knuckle-duster loving Ford, John Magaro's stereotypical Italian solider and Mathilde Ollivier's token French female tomboy Chloe having fun but remaining fairly forgettable with Game of Thrones star Pilou Asbæk stealing the acting show with his turn as evil Nazi Wafner.You never regret going along for this ride with enough imagination, impressive make-up and special effects and darkly imagined horrors such a soldiers traumatic return from death keeping things moving and ever watchable, you just can't help but feel like Overlord had the potential to become a genuine classic of its genre mash-up.Final Say -There's a lot to like about Overlord (an unfortunate box-office dud) that's likely to find a much a larger audience on home release but despite its many strengths and standout individual scenes, this Wolfenstein come to life is a mostly enjoyable but mostly forgettable affair.3 bullet wounds out of 5",Overlord
37,TheMovieDiorama,"Overlord injects its own Nazi serum resulting in firepower, gore and not much else.",6,8 November 2018,"Two saturated sub-genres, WWII and zombies, come together in an over-the-top B movie that showcases outstanding practical effects and visceral action. Bones violently snapping, bullets ferociously flying and bodies hanging on hooks. Bloody surface aside, the lack of character depth and a poorly written script limits the film's enjoyability. An operation to destroy a German control tower is made more challenging when a group of American soldiers discover secret Nazi experiments. The opening sequence may just be the best introduction to a film this year. Exhilarating is an understatement. The sheer violence and terrifying warfare leaves you breathless, gasping for air as you witness soldiers swim for their lives. The third act then fully embraces the genre traits that it aimed to illustrate. Infiltrating an underground Nazi laboratory where grotesque experiments reside in tiny cells, uncontrollably spewing blood and savagely ripping flesh apart. It highlights the exceptional cosmetic work used to enhance the authentic gore that is conceived, particularly Wafner's shredded face. Kurzel's score vibrates your heart with deafeningly piercing bass, accompanied by loud gun shots. However, everything in between these two segments is entirely mediocre, and the screenplay is at fault. The pace drops substantially for thirty minutes after the soldiers land, attempting to establish personalities within these characters. Ultimately though, you just don't care. The protagonist is an overused cliché, the only one embodying a moral compass. The other soldiers, except perhaps two, are expendable and offer no natural investment towards them. The dialogue and interactions between them felt empty, and used just to prolong the runtime. Several character choices were stupid. The ineptitude was absurd, especially as a Nazi officer quite clearly fools one of them by playing dead. Also two unnecessary jump scares that were both predictable and excruciatingly loud. Having said that, I enjoyed Overlord for what it was. Ambitiously gory.",Overlord
38,Tweetienator,Not Ueber-good But Solid,5,19 February 2019,"If you don't take this movie too serious you will have some fun. The mix of WWII and aspects of horror and Nazi-experiments reminds of course not only a little of the legendary Wolfenstein game series or e.g. the Outpost movies (Outpost, Black Sun, Operation Spetsnaz).The production value of Overlord is solid to good (the beginning with the incoming paratroopers and the anti-aircraft fire beats action-wise easy the stuff the last ""masterpiece"" of Mr. Nolan named Dunkirk provides), also the acting and everything else is solid.In short: Overlord provides some fun to everyone who likes evil Nazis, evil experiments, evil zombies and a good shot of horror, but if that mix doesn't sound good and entertaining to you, simply just don't watch.Not outstanding but solid - with some lengths here and there, and of course some historical inaccuracies (like some reviewers describe) and logic issues (why the Germans never used the chemicals on living subjects before the officers takes it!?

42,matthewssilverhammer,Hitler's Monsters would've been a better title...and a better movie.,4,14 November 2018,"Overlord is a horrendous title, especially for this kind of movie. You'd be forgiven for not even being sure what movie I'm talking about when I mention it. It's forgettable, hollow, illogical, and represents the overriding sense that the movie and its filmmakers don't know what kind of film they are making. With 1970's grindhouse concepts and 1980's testosterone-fueled violence, this should be a fun horror-actioner that fulfills our guiltiest pleasures and is titled something like ""Hitler's Monsters"" or ""Nazi Beasts"". Instead, it's treated with little of the visceral silliness it needs, while offering absolutely no substance to warrant being so serious.
It follows a band of thinly written WWII American soldiers who discover Nazis performing body-altering experiments on civilians. There's some intrigue at the beginning as to what exactly is being done, but that intrigue is never met. In place of the twists and surprises you expect, everything plays out completely predictably; the red herring was indeed the killer all along.
The film also deals in war movie clichés like Hitler dealt in bad art. Protagonists nobly disobeying orders; Nazi soldiers as inhuman monsters; the sacrificial redemption of the cocky loudmouth; the conflicted conscientious objector; the final battle in a war-torn village. It's one thing to play with tropes; it's another to abuse them.
The one thing the movie has going for it is the body-horror. Not that it's great, but it's OK. The makeup is quite good and director Avery holds nothing back in the violence and gore. But even then, the lighting and editing often make it difficult to fully appreciate. In the end, Overlord is a project of decent concepts with lackluster execution.",Overlord

47,jtindahouse,Awesome characters set the foundation for a great film,8,25 December 2019,"War movies typically have to be pretty good for me to enjoy them. As a rule they're far from my favourite genre. 'Overlord' though uses a number of elements to make this not your average war movie. The main thing it does is add in elements of horror. These were handled really well. They didn't consume the film or go as far as to ruin the film for people who don't like horror. Films like 'Predator' have done this before and it worked there as well. It's a wonder more filmmakers aren't trying this.I loved the characters in this movie. They were extremely likeable without feeling like they were trying to be. In fact at times they almost felt like they were trying to make some of the characters unlikable, but were doing so in such a way that you couldn't help but like them. The female character 'Chloe' was a really great addition to the film as well. She was perfectly realistic, while still being a likeable bad-ass who you cared about. The characters are written so well they're probably the strongest thing 'Overlord' has going for it.The pacing is also electric. The film kicks straight into gear and then never lets up. Even when things slow down in the middle when they're in an attic, they manage to make it almost the most captivating part of the movie. Finally, there's something extremely satisfying about watching Nazis getting blown away, that's just the icing on the cake for this movie. I had a great time with 'Overlord' and would highly recommend it.",Overlord

49,jadavix,Play Wolfenstein instead.,4,7 February 2019,"""Overlord"" is a tedious and overlong world war 2 fantasy that makes a turn into sci-fi horror territory much later than it should have.To get to that part you have to sit through tiresome scenes of the usual ragtag group of American soldiers sneaking around a Nazi occupied French city where, whaddayaknow, they meet your typical superpowered badass heroine, who is only a civilian, but at one point, shoots a man in the head with a service pistol, in one shot. Where did she learn to shoot like that? Oh, that's right: she has a vagina, which makes her automatically great at everything.I shouldn't complain about the female unicorn too much, though, at least it gave me something to think about. Over an hour of this movie is just a dead zone. I was so tempted to turn it off and do something else, but I sat it out because I knew the movie was going to make a u-turn into sci fi territory.I wish I could say that that was worth the wait, but it really wasn't.Play Wolfenstein instead.",Overlord

I mean, aside from the sci-fi/horror portion of the plot. And, unfortunately, some of the acting is just subpar; it's almost as if JJ Abrams, who produced, was trying to save casting costs. There's a low-rent Danny Huston and a low-rent Gilbert Gottfried/Eddie Deezen (in voice, anyway). My point is that although this is a lot of fun to watch and is indeed pretty creatively done, it flags somewhat when it relies on the charisma or any other strengths of the actors involved.

This is a sci-fi/horror thriller set during WW2, right before the Normandy invasion. A secret mission is launched behind enemy lines in France, to take out a radio tower that the Germans are using to hinder the Allies. Jovan and Wyatt are a couple of the surviving paratroopers to make it down to the ground alive-most are shot down before they can even fight. Mathilde is a local French girl that helps the Americans get close to their target and Pilou is the Nazi officer that is in charge of the radio tower target, inside a local castle. There are also German scientists doing what German scientists are known for doing, experimenting on people. And these experiments are incredibly hard to kill. So, let's see. You have brave American soldiers on a mission. You have evil Nazi scientists creating who knows what kind of horrors in a castle. Oh yeah, you have J.J. Abrams producing the movie. It's a WW2/Zombie movie! What more do you need?
It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence, disturbing images, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.

It throws the viewers right into the fire with an absolutely genius introduction sequence that truly immerses us in the midst of what D-Day would've felt like. The characterization is evident from the start and you really start caring for them early on and throughout, especially the 2 main protagonists played by Joven Adepo and Wyatt Russel. As the story develops you realize there is more to fear than Nazi's and war itself, and it goes into some very odd and gruesome territory with a triumphant heroic finale. The action is absolutely full throttle throughout the film and never lets up with some truly fantastic sequences. The set pieces as well as costume designs were all top notch and once again you feel like you're in that WW2 timeline. The biggest thing I want to talk about are the horror aspects which are phenomenally executed in moderation, and break away from tired ""zombie/infected"" cliches so well. They obviously loosely based this subplot off of the actual terribly bizarre Nazi experiments that went on in those times. Without giving too much away, I will simply say that the way they portray the mutated zombies is done brilliantly and actually quite effective which surprised me. They are way different and more complex than your average slow moving undead cliche zombie that we've been bombarded with over the years. The SFX as well as practical effects are astounding on them as well.

A Captain of colour would not have been commanding a whole unit of the Airborne. But, they had soldiers of colour for ""The Guns of Navarrone"", so I guess we can deal with it.Everything seems as if it's just another war movie until they get into a village and then weird things start happening... and they start finding weird things.

With films like RED SNOW and becoming hits with the horror crowd it was only a matter of time before a mainstream film took the subject in hand. After all Hitler was supposed to have believed in numerous superstitions and various programs have discussed his search for ancient relics to help him win the war. Now we have OVERLORD.The time is D-Day and a group of soldiers are being flown behind enemy lines with the intent of taking down a radio tower so that the air support for the beach invasion can assistance. Before they can get to their jump point their plane is shot down, half the men are lost in the plane and the rest tumble out in the nick of time. Boyce (Jovan Adepo) is lost and confused but find the remaining members of the team.Now in charge is Corporal Ford (Wyatt Russell), the munitions expert whose job it is to take out the tower. Also on hand are the wise cracking New York accented Tibbet (John Magaro), wanna be writer Dawson (Jacob Anderson) and Chase (Iain De Caestecker). As they regroup and head into town Dawson is killed by a landmine. Continuing on they come across French girl Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier) from the village where the tower is located. With her own reasons for hating the Nazis she aids them by taking them to her home.Living with her are her 8 year old brother and her aunt who has been disfigured due to some strange experiments taking place at the German headquarters where the tower is. While the team discusses what to do next a squad of Nazis arrives at the house. Led by SS man Wafner (Pilou Asbaek) he enters the house while they hide, flirts with Chloe before sending his men outside and then attempts to rape her. The team comes to her defense and captures the SS leader and kills his men.Using what information they can gather from Wafner they devise a plan to get into the underground headquarters and blow up the tower. Separating with plans to regroup, Boyce comes across a group of Nazis dumping the bodies of disfigured experiments gone wrong and burning them. Concerned that more is taking place he gets on their truck and finds his way into the underground location.As he wanders the halls attempting to avoid being discovered Boyce finds out the types of experiments that have been going on. Various dead bodies are being brought back to life. The most disturbing is a head with spinal cord still attached that is living. Sneaking out of the headquarters via a sewer tunnel, but not before taking a syringe filled with the Nazi serum, he meets the team and tells them what is taking place. They head back to the house to determine what to do.Once there they begin discussing what to do next. Unfortunately they're interrupted by a group of soldiers who shoot and kill Chase before they are all dispensed with. Not knowing what to do Boyce injects the Nazi serum into Chase who rises but begins to change. His body contorts, he strength increases and he loses control of himself. They then realize that the serum will be used to turn the Nazi soldiers into superhuman battle ready combatants that must be stopped.The movie works well on many levels but at the same time becomes far too involved at others. It features so many story points that overlap and run on top of one another that by the end you're left trying to remember if all of them have been answered or not. In spite of that it does provide an interesting film that will hold your attention from start to finish.While most of the cast is rarely unknown (for me I only recognized Bokeem Woodbine as the squad leader killed early on and De Caestecker who stars as Fitz on TV's MARVEL'S AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D) they all do an admirable job here. Their fear is palpable and their incredulous looks when confronted by what could be the ultimate evil are quite believable.In the end I would recommend the movie for an evening's entertainment but perhaps not for the squeamish. The effects are well done and compliment the story and that story does draw you in. It ended up being a movie I enjoyed watching but also felt I'd never revisit.",Overlord

60,kluseba,Historical events meet gripping horror elements,9,4 June 2019,"When I initially watched Overlord, I was expecting an average horror movie with a few shallow historical references. What I've got however is an atmospheric, gripping and mysterious horror film with appropriate references to the horrors of the Second World War. The story is obviously inspired by experiments Nazi Germany actually conducted on human beings. The story revolves around a group of young American soldiers who are sent behind enemy lines in preparation of the Invasion of Normandy. After their plane is shot down, they must hide in a village where they befriend some French farmers. However, they aren't only willing to escape, hide and survive but also try to destroy a German radio tower located in an old church on a wooden hill. However, the soldiers find something abominable in the basement of said church and are determined to wipe it out without leaving any trace behind.The movie convinces on several levels. First of all, the characters have a lot of depth and interest for a horror movie. The American soldiers have different strategies to fight the enemy which makes them quite diversified. It's also easy to sympathize with the French farmers including the resilient love interest of a SS Hauptsturmführer, her joyful little brother and her creepy disfigured aunt who has been abused during an experiment conducted by the invaders.The film oozes with atmosphere. We are thrown into the story as the plane of the American soldiers gets shot down and they soon need to fight for survival in the ocean, on the beaches and in the nearby forests. The French village where they decide to hide is a place where fear, hatred and terror reigns. The church tower is dark, eerie and seems to be an endless maze of horrors.This flick mixes historical events with fictitious elements. The brutal opening sequence foreshadows the actual Invasion of Normandy. The suffering the French villagers go through also seems realistic. Even the idea that the Germans conducted experiments on human beings isn't pulled out of thin air. On the other side, the true nature of those experiments is the fictitious part that should equally please to cinephiles enjoying action and horror movies.In the end, Overlord cleverly mixes action elements inspired by historical events with fictitious horror elements. This dynamic mixture entertains from start to finish thanks to tense atmosphere, strong characters and intriguing locations. The movie manages to portray the horrors of war while also adding an appropriate fictitious touch to it. Many movies have tried to combine war films with horror films and failed but Overlord is one of the most balanced attempts at this gripping mixture. Horror movies usually receive poor critical acclaim but this movie has overall been received rather favourable ratings which actually point out how great this film actually is. Give it a try and you might end up being as positively surprised as I was.",Overlord

Their plane is nearly blown up in a scene that takes forever. A couple of these soldiers make it to ground alive and somehow reunite. They meet a French girl and they make her take them to her village. Of course it's taken over by evil Nazi soldiers. The Nazi captain tries to rape the girl, that's when the good-natured US soldier intervenes. Because they are on a schedule he is sent to look around the Nazi base nearby. He discovers there some weird human experiments. For no good reason he brings back some filled syringe. Back at the village the captured Nazi ends up shooting one of the soldiers so our guy decides for no good reason to inject the dead soldier with the syringe. It causes him to revive and mutate of sorts. Plus this guy is hard to kill now.Eventually our gang decides it's time to complete the mission, which now includes rescuing the captured little brother of the French girl, so these 4 goofs decide to take on the entire Nazi base. The Nazi captain has escaped back to base in the meantime not before getting shot in the face. He injects himself with the serum and turns into a supernazi as the rest of our soldiers have to battle nazis and zombie mutants.A big budget horror movie with Nazis and zombies should work but Overlord really doesn't. The main problem is that it's told from the perspective of some dull kid soldier. As always the villains are far more interesting yet we learn nothing about them, nothing about the science and the experiments going on. The bits of horror are good, the bits of war OK and predictable. Had they edited this movie by 19 minutes it would have been much better.

Not because the action scenes are necessarily done poorly, but it goes to show how little plot the film really has and how inferior everything else is to it, as well as simply proving itself to be boring.

Torturing anyone isn't heroic. One character stands out as decent but the general feel of his comrades is pretty dismal. Who really cares what horrors this bunch face?The only real upside is the quality of cinematic's, especially in the opening scenes of the film but this consideration, on its own, does not a quality movie make.In my estimation a lot spent, yet again, on very little.

68,peterp-450-298716,Entertaining but not what I expected after seeing the trailer.,6,2 March 2019,"The German doctor, he believes the tar in the ground
has some kind of a power.
He calls it his science.
But it's just an excuse to kill us.When I watched the movie ""Trench 11"" at the end of last year, I already said this might be the cheaper version of ""Overlord"". The starting point was identical. In ""Trench 11"" it's a group of soldiers who had to search an abandoned bunker of the Germans. There were rumors the Germans conducted experiments there. The Germans tried to fabricate a chemical product so they could create invincible storm troops and thus conquer the rest of the non-German-Friendly world. The biggest difference between ""Overlord"" and ""Trench 11"" is the choice of world war. In ""Trench 11"" they were wallowing in the trenches during World War I. ""Overlord"" takes place during the 2nd World War. That means a lot of raised hands and loud clacking of heels. But the rest is actually similar. A film that shows the madness of a filthy war and mixes this with non-human creatures with the madness flowing through their veins.Operation Overlord was the code name for the invasion by the Allies in German-occupied Western Europe. Obviously, that's where the film got its title from. And that's also where this film begins. A swarm of flying fortresses on their way to France to drop a load of paratroopers. It seemed as if I was watching ""The Longest Day"" back again. Even the ritual with the agreed code words ""Flash"" and ""Thunder"" is used in this movie (Though I missed the clicking). The opening scene is still impressive and reminds you of legendary WWII films such as ""Saving Privat Ryan"" (although the first 15 minutes of the latter were obviously more impressive).The first part is therefore entirely devoted to the mission of a few American paratroopers. The task they need to complete is disabling a radio tower somewhere in a French village. An extremely important assignment, it seems, It sounds far-fetched but the success of the entire invasion depends on it apparently. From the group of soldiers Boyce (Jovan Adepo), Ford (Wyatt Russell, son of) and Tibbet (John Magaro) take center stage. Boyce is the wimp. An inexperienced soldier who's regarded by the others as useless. Ford is the leading officer who has to make sure the operation succeeds. A gut-eater avant la lettre. And Tibbet is the bigmouth of them all who brags about his sniper qualities. Something that he wants to put into practice in Berlin. He'll put a bullet through Hitler's head and thus end this world war rapidly.Their path crosses that of Chloe (Mathilde Olivier), a French resistance fighter who wants to take revenge on the German occupiers of her village. Understandable, since those Germans systematically use the inhabitants of the village as test animals. Including Chloe's parents. From here, the film gradually transforms into a horror/zombie film. Not that it's all so scary or nerve-racking. In my opinion ""Overlord"" is nothing more than a typical war film in which a commando, with a specific mission, not only battles German troops but also non-human opponents. So be prepared for lots of veined bloodthirsty creatures, blown away or crushed body parts and gallons of blood.I wasn't really impressed by this film. For me, it's just a more expensive, slick version of ""Trench 11"". Maybe I was misled by the trailer. The trailer suggested it would be a blood-curdling zombie movie. Ultimately, the film shows the horror of this world war in a proper way. And there are also a bunch of crazy Nazi doctors who try to create an Übermensch. Something similar as when General Ludendorff sniffs some kind of chemical stuff in ""Wonder Woman"", after which he suddenly has superhuman powers. In short, ""Overlord"" is a pulp war/horror movie. It's great material to create some kind of videogame from. It isn't very original and certainly disappointing for the seasoned horror fanatic. But this much I can say. It isn't boring. On the contrary. It's entertaining enough. And it's been expertly put together. It's worth a look for sure.",Overlord

71,a_chinn,"""The Guns of Navarone"" meets ""The Island of Doctor Moreau""",7,19 April 2020,"Enjoyably gonzo genre mashup of WWII men-on-a-mission type of films (i.e. ""The Dirty Dozen"" ""Where Eagles Dare"" ""The Guns of Navarone"") and wackadoo horror flicks, seemingly inspired by everything from ""The Island of Doctor Moreau"" to ""The Thing"" to even ""The Toxic Avenger."" The story follows a group of WWII airborne soldiers dropped behind enemy lines to knock out a radio tower before D-Day. Pretty standard war film set up, right? Wrong! That's when these standard issue war film soldier stereotypes encounter an underground Nazi lair containing some monstrous experiments, and not the concentration camp kind but the mad scientists kind. On the downside, the film leans too heavily on war film and horror movie cliches, which may have been intentional for the film's mash-up premise, but that does detract from the film's originality. Also, the film unfortunately peaks midway through the story with one dynamite scene when our heroes fight a horrific monster in an attic they're hiding out in. From there, the film becomes a rather routine action film. Not a bad action film, but a pretty familiar one. ""Overlord"" is not a film for all tastes, but if ""Von Ryan's Express"" meets ""Re-Animator"" sounds like a good time, you should definitely check it out. On a site note, it's super fun to see Kurt Russell's lookalike son, Wyatt Russell, in an action film role (he'd sure make a good Snake Plissken for an ""Escape from New York"" remake). And if you enjoyed ""Overlord"" and want to see a similarly themed Nazi monster movie, check out ""Frankenstein's Army."" It's less of a straight faced horror film like ""Overlord"" and is more of a goofy horror movie along the lines of ""Evil Dead"" or ""Dead Snow,"" but still has a lot of gory WWII horror fun, if that's what you're in the mood for.",Overlord
72,masonsaul,Great combination of genres,9,17 March 2019,Overlord combines a war movie with zombie horror with great success. The performances from all of it's cast are great. It's got plenty of bloody action with an incredible opening and great direction throughout. All of this helps to make up for the characters lack of depth.,Overlord
73,Reviews_of_the_Dead,More Than Just the Horrors of War,8,4 December 2018,"This was a film I was quite intrigued to check out. I heard reviews from podcasts that I listen to and it sparked even more interest. Being that it is a horror film set during World War II, in the actual war also was something that else that had me wanting to see this. The official synopsis for the film is a small group of American soldiers find horror behind enemy lines on the eve of D-Day.We don't waste any time on getting into this film. The film introduces us to the soldiers on the flight to the mission. They are airborne soldiers and they are heading into France ahead of the D-Day invasion. Their mission is to blow up a radio tower above a church. Ford (Wyatt Russell) is their demolition expert and will lead the mission. Boyce (Jovan Adepo) is a soldier who was drafted and is reluctant to fight. My favorite is Tibbet (John Magaro) who is a tough talking guy who gives Boyce grief.Things don't go as played though. As they fly over occupied France, they meet resistance from Nazi forces. Their plane takes a hit and they don't get to jump as planned. They get separated and try to find their way to the mission. Ford and Boyce meet up. It is during their trek that Boyce starts to see the horrors of war that Ford encountered during his time in Italy. They do find others on their way to the village. This also brings them to Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier). She takes them to the village where they learn that the Nazi forces are up to something inside of the church. This also brings them to one of the commanders, Wafner (Pilou Asbæk).I am trying to stay a little bit vague here in my recap of what happens in the film as to try to avoid spoiling anything. There is a good portion of this film though that is an action, adventure, war film like a Saving Private Ryan. I was expecting to see some of that, but I really wasn't expecting as much of it as we got. I do have to say, that aspect of the film was actually good. It made it feel like they were really there. It is also interesting as it had my anxiety up as they are trying to navigate the town without being caught.The other aspect to the film is the mystery of what they are doing inside the church as there is a secret lab there. Now this isn't really spoiling it, as this is shown in the trailers. I think that it gets revealed at a good pace which I had me wanting to know more. There is an aspect of sci-fi here as well. Something else though that I really like is incorporating the Nazi and their search for occult things. I won't give away what they are doing in the lab, but I definitely dug it. I was a big fan for sure.Personally I was hoping for a more contained film than what we got though. The trailers made it seem that it would be, but I am not going to blame them for that. Really though, I kind of wanted it to be just inside the bunker/lab for more of it and really explore the experiments down there. There is something hinted at as to why they decided to set-up the base there. We do get some of this; I just personally wanted a little bit more.I will say that the editing of the film was good. For a film that is close to 2 hours long, it doesn't really feel like it. The tension builds throughout the film and for different reasons. Earlier on it is more about survival and trying to complete the mission. The more that you learn about what is going on here, you get more of the horror of trying to stop what is being done while trying to survive as well. I really liked this about the film. I thought the ending was pretty satisfying for what the film was going for as well.The acting of the film definitely helps as well. Adepo I thought was really good as the lead. His character is interesting, because we learn a story about him and how he doesn't really want to be there. He isn't sure that he can kill anyone. As the film goes on though, he hardens and will do what it takes to survive. Russell was surprising as I knew the moment I saw him that he was Kurt Russell's son. I thought he was excellent in the film. He has enough of that badass attitude in him for sure. Ollivier was good as well. I felt bad for what she deals with and the loss of those around her. Asbæk is such a great villain. He goes through an interesting transformation as well. The rest of the cast round out for what they needed, but I do need to shout out Magaro. I thought he was funny and he turned in a solid performance as well.Effects for the film were really done as well. The battle aspects with gunshots, wounds and blood all looked good. It surprisingly didn't make me cringe, which with how realistic it was, I was surprised it didn't. The creatures we see in the film are also really good looking. They move in an interesting way and that was pretty creepy to see as well. The film was also shot very well. It does a great job to make it feel like we are really there.Now with that said, I thought this was an interesting film. It combines something that is quite horrific like war and then adds other elements to it. On top of that, it has an aspect I am a really big fan of and that is the Nazis and their search for the occult. I would have liked to see more a contained horror film, but I don't mind what they did in this one. The title of the film also has an interesting name as I it's the name of the project that is going on. The acting and effects were really good. The film is edited very well to build tension throughout to a satisfying ending. As for the score, it didn't really stand out to me or really hurt the film either. I do think there are some minor issues, but I thought this was a good film and worth a viewing for sure.",Overlord
74,robertemerald,Odd mix of genres creates an odd movie,7,14 June 2019,"Here's something odd about Overlord. Honestly, the initial brilliance of the opening terror of parachute troops making their way to D-Day sets in the mind a very high expectation of further extravaganza that, of course, never happens. Much as I love such a dedication (this year is the 75th anniversary of D-Day), it was so unnecessary. The movie would have been far better served if it had just begun with parachutes falling from the sky. There's huge potential for graphic horror just in that. Saving Private Ryan succeeded with a similar barnstorming opening because it followed up with a further two battles of similar savagery. Another problem with Overlord is the bickering between the small surviving platoon. Again, its characterisations are similar to the TV series Band of Brothers, but for me this style of script only irritated, and did nothing to endear me to the characters or the narrative, and did nothing to enhance the sense of tension and urgency, something the movie only really gains only once the bullets start flying. It was a wasted opportunity. We should have been trembling well before we enter the gates of hell, rather than excited by the gun battles. There is a notional attempt to do this (a strange dead carcass, and an unwelcome visit by an SS officer), but it's not enough. This replacement of tension and terror with excitement feeds into the encounter with the sci-fi element, which certainly works in its classic originality as it produces some wonderfully hideous images, but again, the movie went for gripping fights and excitement rather than building anxiety, shock and horror. I'm glad that Overlord exists as I love sci-fi, although it is really just yet another zombie version, which I concede is hugely fashionable these days. With Overlord though, given its impressive budget, there was an opportunity to try it on with some terrifying animals and some very dark encounters, such as they do in the Resident Evil or conventional horror movies. As an action movie Overlord is certainly worth a solid 7 out of 10. Alas, with more forethought it could have been a classic horror movie instead, and less a pulp fiction.",Overlord
75,davidmvining,Why couldn't it just embrace that weirdness more?,5,27 November 2019,"Sometimes, you just want to see zombie monster Nazis get blowed up real good. That's a fun way to spend a couple of minutes, but if you want to sustain interest over a full two hours, a bit more work needs to go into it. Overlord does try, but it ends up spending too much time in a single location, beyond reason, and descending into a generic monster fight by the end. Still, points for effort.It's the night before D-Day and a group of paratroopers are riding out the night over France, ready to deploy to the French countryside and take out an important communications array. The flak from the German anti-aircraft batteries hit the plane, forcing it down early, killing most of those on board, and landing only a handful near their landing zone. Chief among them is Private Boyce and Corporal Ford as well as a few others.The opening sequence is rather well done once the flak starts. The fall where we follow Boyce from the air to the ground is chock full of detail and feels dangerous. Keeping the point of view tight with Boyce is one of the keys, and it's handled really well.Anyway, once on the ground and collected, they walk to the town with the communications tower. It's a prototypical French town under occupation with an overbearing German presence and cowed, but determined, French populace. The only French person we get to know is Chloe, a young good looking woman who attracts the attention of the German Captain Wafner. Wafner is the kind of monster you expect from a horror movie set in Nazi occupied France. He uses Chloe for sex, holding her family's welfare over her head in order to accomplish it, while also gleefully enjoying violence on other people at the same time. Boyce forces his fellow soldiers' hand, captures Wafner and then goes out to investigate a bit, accidentally falls into a truck full of dead bodies, gets transported into the sealed base, and escapes out through some underground tunnels.It's here that I really picked up. The stuff that Boyce finds in those tunnels and in a hidden lab are a bit out of nowhere and is super weird. I especially like the head, still connected to its spine but nothing else, calling out for help. It's the sort of set of images designed to instill a sort of abject horror because it has little connection to the everyday. I'd go so far as to say that it's Lovecraftian. Unfortunately, the movie never follows up on that promise.After his quick trip, Boyce brings back a mysterious syringe to the captured German captain. We get a couple of long scenes of Ford beating Wafner, trying to get information. Wafner ends up with his hands on a gun, killing one of the other soldiers. In a very odd moment, Boyce decides to inject the newly created corpse of his buddy with the mysterious syringe. Buddy immediately comes back from the dead filled with rage trying to kill everyone, only to be stopped when Boyce bashes him in the head multiple times, enough to crush the skull completely. They're in an attic, having shouted for hours, had a couple of gunshots, and more shouting, and the local Nazis never come to investigate. Sure.Time runs out, and the soldiers need to move. So, they create a diversion in one of the most implausible ways possible (tying a German soldier to a motorcycle, filling the sidecar with explosives, and somehow getting him to drive it right into the German base as though he had no control of the motorcycle) and move in. There's fighting back and forth, Wafner gets injected with the serum as well as Ford and they have some sort of wire-assisted fight of human monsters with gory makeup. It's a serious step down from the weird Lovecraftian horror of Boyce's first trip into the base. It's fine, but nothing compared to the earlier promise.Good guys win. Bad guys lose. Boyce buries the truth of the serum until tons of rubble.The movie's a real mixed bag. It's better in its first half than second. It's middle section drags in a single room. The final fight is a letdown. I think the movie's cinematography betrays a studio bound feel with too many unexplained light sources lighting too much. A more naturalistic feel might have worked better for me (with more limited light from more defined sources). It's amusing enough for a single viewing, but no more than that.",Overlord

However, I am not a fan of zombie or the infected films. They are just a bit played out and while I am in the minority, I just sorta find them ridiculous. I don't watch them often. I decided to check this one out though and it was better than I expected.It starts out great. There is a lot of CGI stuff in the opening scenes and I thought it was nicely done. The second act was slow and it seemed a bit lengthy. It took a while to get things really going and it ended ok.It was strange that we don't see many zombies throughout the film but we got to see a pretty awesome transformation scene. The acting wasn't bad, it was filmed well, story and makeup were ok but the dialog needed some tweaking. It wasn't gory or very scary though.Overall, this is a zombie film I liked.",Overlord
78,arungeorge13,Quite enjoyable for both war-movie and zombie-horror fanatics! [+66%],7,18 February 2019,"I watched 'Overlord' without having seen its trailer or read its synopsis and it was, by all means, a thoroughly entertaining fare. From its spectacular opening scene (aboard a fighter aircraft) to the slow-burn middle portions to the action-packed finale, Overlord is a movie that dips its feet in multiple genres. It tackles the action and visual effects bit really well (the film's been produced by J.J Abrams and that shows!), the zombie-horror subplot is a decent (but not entirely original) touch, and it has a couple of characters (that of Jovan Adepo as 'Private Boyce' and Wyatt Russell as 'Corporal Ford') that drive the story forward well.The WW2 setting with a zombie twist is a subgenre in itself that has been explored by many a filmmaker previously; Julius Avery adds his own take to it and manages to keep the viewer reasonably enthralled. Wyatt Russell reminds you a lot of his dad Kurt (the R.J MacReady vibes are pretty strong) with his straightforward, no-nonsense demeanor while Jovan Adepo adds the much-needed layering to his soldier-but-empathetic-human-first character. There are a few jump-scares, a satisfying amount of gore, and well-choreographed set-pieces that are sure to grab the attention of the respective genre-fanatics.To be fair to the movie, the zombie-horror element is minimal in the initial half and it eventually melds into the major component of the storyline as the film draws to an action-packed, blood-spilling close. In fact, an easy way to perceive the film would be as one that sheds light on the horrors of WW2 in the first half while it caters more to horror fanatics in the second. Does it manage to satiate the cravings of both kinds of viewers? To a fair extent, yes.There are obvious nods to Tarantino's 'Inglorious Basterds' and Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan' that make the discerning viewer sit up and take notice. The antagonist, played by Pilou Asbæk, is the zombified-Nazi version of Christoph Waltz's Col. Hans Landa. Avery's directorial graph is certainly cresting; he has made an entertaining sister-flick to the above-mentioned masterpieces. From a B-movie point of view, that indicates a winner! Would I recommend it? Yep, to those who are interested in a war/zombie crossover packed with enough story-telling devices, gore, and visual effects!",Overlord

The scene was was really impressive as the Germans destroyed their planes and they landed in separate points. Ford and Tibbet and Boyce are all amazing characters. They took refuge in a villagers girl's house whose aunt is sick and has a little brother. They took hostage a nazi soldier who was hitting on the girl. He shot one of them and Boyce injected him the red substance and he became invincible. The transformation was amazing and he didn't stop until his head was smashed open. They entered the castle from the sewer canals to explode the tower and ford the leader of the American soldiers had to inject himself the substance to fight against the soldier who got shot in the face while getting away from the houses attic and injected himself. Ford locked himself up in the castle and Boyce blew up the whole place and he didn't tell anyone about him changing.

A WWII-set, Science-Fiction blood binge made for midnight viewings... or at least, that was the intention. Overlord, the actual film, has trouble expressing itself in this way. At times it takes itself too seriously. Other times, it goes for the gross out moment, but never takes it far enough. Overlord seems to be afraid of it's own shadow. It should've been more outrageous, more shameless and more hard-R that it is here. A worth while effort, and far from a cheap cinematic affair, but not satisfying.",Overlord
88,rockman182,Overlord (2018),7,10 November 2018,"Nitially thought of as the next film in the loose Cloverfield series but I'm glad its its own entity. That franchise is on a nose dive and I was curious as to the looks of this one. Its under the J.J. Abrams banner and from a relatively unknown filmmaker. I was actually surprised by how solid this film was and was pleased. Its a war film and zombie film hybrid but one that is really effective because of the fact that it gets both genres right. I'm happy.The film takes place on the eve of D-Day and sees a crew land from plane and attempt to take out a German tower. Along the way they befriend a civilian who aids them to the tower. However, once they get to the tower they start to discover that there are very disturbing Nazi experiments that are occurring in that tower. These secret experiments are occurring to create the perfect war soldier and the crew need to try to contain the horrors they see.The film, as mentioned earlier, works effectively as a war film because its tense, gritty, loud, and realistic in its depiction. Had a Saving Private Ryan feel. Then the film explores the more re-animation/zombie elements and its still great. The costumes and potential effects look great and it becomes an entertaining mindless horror survival at times. The blend of both genres works very well which makes for a good popcorn film.The unimaginable wartime horrors witnessed are supernatural and you get to see it from the shock on the soldier's faces. There was probably a basis for truth here because I'm sure there were Nazi experiments that occurred but obviously nothing to this extent or result. Overall, Overlord is a surprisingly fun time all around and has enough originality going for it to stand on its own. An Overlord universe would fare better than a Cloverfield universe.7.5/10",Overlord

90,RforFilm,"Overlord is an entertaining, WWII horror movie that delivers what it promises",7,12 November 2018,"Horror has the potential to stretch the genre into several areas, but despite it's popularity, many people tends to stick to formula. It's something that I can't blame on filmmakers, as each horror story is an extension of their own fear. No matter what their afraid of, translating it to a visual medium is tricky, as they have to find a new way to tell it. What I mean about stretching the genre is that they tend to make it scary...and that's about it. We've seen horror romances (Dracula), horror comedies (Evil Dead 2, Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil), but what about horror action?With the exception of the Resident Evil movies (which I haven't seen a single one), blending these genres isn't easy. Horror tends to rely on tight spaces and psychological fear while action tends to involve a large group of people and making the setting as large as possible. It's difficult to generate fear within a large space, but it can be done. With today's movie, we tapped into the fear of what our enemies were working on that we never saw. There are a lot of conspiracy theories about Nazi's developing magic, science-fiction technology and dealing with the dead. We get a look at that in Overlord.During a raid over France, paratrooper Ed Boyce (played by Jovan Adepo) is flung out just as his plane was attacked. He manages to land without any damage, but he's know behind enemy lines. He manages to find fellow paratroopers Tibbet, Chase, Dawson, and Corporal Ford (played by Wyatt Russell). They make their way to a local village where a young woman Chloe (played by Mathilde Olliver) takes them in. her parents have been taken away, leaving her only with her little brother Paul, and her Aunt who she claims to be ""sick"".Some men leave the place to inspect the village, hoping to find a way to escape to the rendezvous point. The others stay behind where they manage to take a Nazi SS Hauptsturmführer prisoner. Boyce, one of the inspecting soldiers, finds Nazis burning disfigured people, which lead him to finding a lab under the church. It seems that experiments are being performed to resurrect the dead and give them inhumane strength. He brings samples back to the house where the troop hopes to find answers, but cause chaos where the Nazi escapes with Paul in tow. It's up to them to make a rescue while experiencing the horror of the undead.Overlord feels a lot like a good ""run and gun"" video game; it has a great setting with a lot of creative action going on. It sounds like an entertaining movie and it is. I'm sure there are a couple of undead Nazi movies out there on Netflix, but this is certainly the first I've seen done in a mainstream fashion. The best element is the atmosphere, which balances out when it needs to be scary (like when our characters are sneaking around), gross (when the experiments are revealed) and warm (when the soldiers are talking with Chloe).Where the movie does fall is with the characters. While their not bad or even that forgettable, they were still a bit stale. Like you tell that Wyatt Russell is the no nonsense guy, Jovan is the ""quiet with a heart of gold"" man, and the Nazi is the evil man. Even Chloe tends to be the quiet pretty girl who occasionally does something badass. I think more could have been done when it came to their discovery of the experiments and whether someone would have wanted the US to be conducting similar experiments.I'll give this seven zombie Nazis out of ten. Its an easy movie to digest and is even a fun one. You get exactly what you expect and then it ends. I think even the movie is aware of it's easy task of being a rush. I don't have much else to say other then it's fine. Go see this and take the shot.",Overlord

That flaw is mostly hammered in by the Character Tibbit who plays the card shark tough tongued rough nut American character so cliche it hurts, and for me it hurt this movie. You could smell every cliche he was given to deliver moments before it lands. Heart of gold moment where he runs to 'save the boy', shot in the back, yep, didn't see that coming a mile away.
I did sort of like the tight ridiculousness of the action, They were walking through enemy territory where they know there are lots of enemy soldiers but they're all talking loud like they're outside at a party. Was this supposed to be funny or just terrible direction and script? The team manage to wander around a heavily german soldier infested town like it was nothing, and missed getting caught at every turn by micro seconds of luck, sort of, but then I think I'm being generous and it was actually asking for too much suspension of disbelief, as too was the black central character wandering around German occupied France like it was nothing. Good actor, spoiled the reality of the story if there was supposed to be any.The effects are done well, as are every film these days, the black hero was ok, although The title is wasted on this film as there doesn't appear to be an overlord, and the more I think about this movie the more I think it messes up annoyingly where it really shouldn't have.

93,markthomassintek,T4 PROGRAM,8,7 November 2018,"REVIEW - OVERLORDEveryone is aware of what happened to the people imprisoned in the concentration camps during the second world war but still what isn't known is the experiments which were carried out also.For example disabled people were seen as a blight on stretched resources so were used as guinea pigs for various experiments and were killed under the T4 Program.Many experiments tried to create a stronger soldier with the ability to ignore pain and there was rumours of a super soldier as with Captain America, but where Captain America is (as far as I believe) fiction unfortunately the Nazi experiments were all too true.This surprisingly enjoyable film takes these rumours further and does so in a more war film than horror.Yes this topic has been used in a few films and yes no one is certain if a super soldier was even created but the fact that these experiments even happened is enough to go and see this film.Rating 8 out of 10",Overlord

It's rare that filmmakers in Hollywood (these days) are given complete freedom to create the movie they want to create, or so it seems. Happily, after watching Overlord, I noticed none of that. While the subject matter may not interest a large audience, I believe this movie can be enjoyed by fans of many genres. If you have an open mind, whether you're a fan of war films, sci-fi films, or a good old fashion slasher/horror, I think Overlord may impress you as much as it impressed me. From start to finish, here's why I believe it's very hard for audience members to get bored with this one.Nearing D-Day, American soldiers are being flown into the battlefield. After their plane is shot down, they form an unlikely ally, while one of them begins to discover that the Nazis have been kidnapping Americans and experimenting on them in bizarre ways. This movie asks a lot of you throughout the second and third acts, as it sets it up as a war film, but pulls the rug out from under you as the movie progresses. As I mentioned, this film is part war, part sci-fi, and part horror, and those genres surprisingly blend together very well and this movie never keeps you waiting. The pacing of this film is easily the aspect that stood out the most to me.A premise like this can easily be chuckled at, but the fact that it begins as a war film, turns into a sci-fi film, and ends up being a horror movie, makes for a very interesting experience. From the second this film started, I felt riveted. Whether you're into an action sequence, a comedy bit, or on the edge of your seat to see who will make it out alive, there's absolutely no downtime. I'm not saying some movies don't need or deserve to be three hours long, but this is a perfect example of a film that utilizes the perfect amount of time needed to tell its story. Giving just the right amount of characters development to most of the crew, just the right amount of horror to not turn off the action junkies who just came for that, and hardly any drawn-out scenes of characters conversing, at 105 minutes, there isn't a single moment where you can take a break and then come back, not having missed something.Although Julius Avery does a very solid job in terms of direction, it's the combination of a tight script by Billy Ray and Mark L. Smith and the frenetic editing by Matt Evans that truly shine here. To me, the overall outcome of the pacing of this film originated with those two elements. On top of that, you have a great cast to keep your audience engaged. While I haven't heard of many of these performers in the past, I can see them receiving quite a few jobs in the near future. For what this film was trying to be, I really can't find many things to complain about here.In the end, Overlord shocked me with how much I actually enjoyed it. The premise itself should make for a bad On Demand release that most people would forget about, but there's a lot of effort put into this movie. The overall story itself may be its biggest issue, due to the fact that there are flaws within the plans of what the Nazis are plotting, but that was a minor nitpick in the grand scheme of things. Personally, I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish and I highly recommend this movie to those who can handle the three genres of war, sci-fi, and horror. Overlord is tightly paced and full of energy.",Overlord
96,kuarinofu,The trailer fooled me,5,9 February 2019,"Or did I miss something?
I had totally different expectations after I've seen the trailer. I thought this was going to be a good mystery/horror trash (set in WW2 times), like Frankenstein's Army (2013), The bunker (2001), Deathwatch (2002), Outpost (2008), R-point (2004), GP506 (2008). I love these kinds of movies and I love getting back and re-watching those I've mentioned. But no. Does it have a good mystery? Does it feel like classic Return to the Castle Wolfenstein or the new Wolfenstein games? Nope.
The focus is always in the wrong places. It never holds your attention or keeps you guessing mostly because for the first 1 hour of the movie absolutely nothing happens. The movie really feels like it is a written story rather than a real life scenario, which really hurts. The soldiers act in a way a writer would want them to. Some of the side plots get abandoned mid movie and lots of character actions really leave no impact on the world they are in. It's like the world build itself around them and not them trying to live in it. At times it feels like there was a lot of cut material or some scenes are incredibly forced (kid scene closer to the end).
I think this my biggest problem - the script is just bad. It never feels believable and thus it's much harder to identify with the characters or feel what they are feeling.
Other than that, while the whole mystery is never explored and sort of comes flat, I enjoyed the first 20 mins or so, while I was still guessing what they are up to. Also, the make up effects were good as well as some of the imagery. Yet it still feels like a waste of a good R-rated mystery trash.
I even bought the tickets for this and I'm glad I missed it due to heavy workload, I surely would've been disappointed.",Overlord

98,brankovranjkovic,Overload - Universal Soldier Remake,5,14 November 2018,"Very violent fantasy horror.American paratroopers are shot down over Nazi-occupied France, their mission is to destroy a tower holding a radio transmitter. Under the tower is a lab where the Nazi's are experimenting on the locals, their intention is to create super soldiers. They generally end up with zombie creatures.
There's plenty of gory fights.The whole plot is very predictable and made me think this was a remake of 'Universal Soldier'. All in all pretty mediocre.",Overlord
99,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,9 November 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)First things first: don't you dare miss this one! I never expected to be as entertained and constantly at edge as I felt throughout this film. J.J. Abrams has a tremendous production capability, and Overlord proves it. It incorporates every genre that you can remember of in an almost seamlessly process. I guess I'll start with the beginning since the first 20-30 minutes provide one of the best opening sequences of the last few years.Overlord is definitely a war movie, and its foundations are actually based on true stories from WWII. Obviously, being J.J. Abrams a sci-fi master, he stretches those stories a bit so we can have a brilliant rollercoaster of genres. Mystery, thriller, horror, sci-fi, drama, comedy, war, action, ... I mean, every genre that you can think of (well, I guess musical can be excluded) is present in this film, some more than others.Usually, that is not a good sign because it's extremely hard to balance two/three tones or genres, let alone a whole bunch of them. That said, Julius Avery is one hell of a director! He and his writers were able to mix everything up and still make a cohesive and even claustrophobic movie since it's pretty much one-location after that opening act. Let's go genre by genre ...War: the best depiction of what a war looks and SOUNDS like since Dunkirk. I watched this on IMAX, and the sound design is unbelievable. I could feel every bullet flying through, and the CGI is eyegasmic. That opening scene with the military flying over the ""battlefield"" is visually jaw-dropping, and the score elevates the tension by being extremely powerful. Chills all over my body.Sci-fi/Mystery/Thriller: even though the premise pretty much explains what the Nazis are doing in their medical experiments, the way that Mark L. Smith and Billy Ray structure the film's narrative and write the dialogues is remarkable. Every exposition scene feels natural and rich from a storytelling perspective. It doesn't improve the mystery itself, but it sure helps the audience to navigate through the story.Horror: it relies on predictable yet effective jump scares, but the ""monsters"" are very well ""designed."" With a mix of CGI and makeup, every single scene involving these human experiments is nail-biting great. Whether that's a chasing or fight sequence, or merely a suspense moment where we can't really see the entire human body, the horror vibe is excellently implemented.Comedy: such a heavy and bloody R-rated flick, needs some sort of relief. Comedy isn't precisely a predominant genre, but John Magaro's character carries an important role. You might be thinking ""bah, he is just a bland comic relief character with no decent development,"" but you're wrong. Tibbet is extremely well-developed! He simply has a funny personality, and he does banter a lot, but throughout the movie, he keeps evolving as a character and ultimately surprises us in the third act. I also love Iain De Caestecker (Chase), and I congratulate him on finally getting a role in a big film!Drama: Jovan Adepo (Boyce), Wyatt Russell (Ford) and Mathilde Ollivier (Chloe) are what I would call the movie's protagonists. They are the ones that carry most of the story. Adepo is the lead, and he is fantastic, as well as his two counterparts. However, it's due to the amazing characters' scripts that they are able to shine. Every single character in the film (well, except the Nazis, obviously) has a script meant for the audience to care about them.Every death has an impact, either on the audience or the other characters. There's a ton of ethical dilemmas throughout their mission, and these three are always arguing with each other since everyone thinks differently. Their dialogues are very captivating, and they undoubtedly improve the screenplay. I rarely blinked due to the high level of entertainment and excitement. Story and character-wise, this is one of 2018's best. Pure entertainment AND well-written characters? Count me in!However, it doesn't end up here. Technically, this movie is impressive and magnificent. I genuinely had my heart pumping hard after that opening sequence (am I repeating myself too much?). The score is intensely sumptuous, the cinematography is impeccable, and the visual effects are out of this world. The action stunts (chases and fights) are so realistic that you can feel every punch, kick, bullet and explosion like you were there.Julius Avery works the camera in such a mind-blowing way. Even though some scenes require massive CGI, he still produces some one-take wonders. From Boyce jumping from the plane to him running away from explosions going off closer and closer, Avery sure knows his craft of filmmaking. I wanted to give this film an A+ so much, but I can't. I have one and one only minor issue that I can't just ignore.I wrote above that it mixes each genre ALMOST perfectly ... Midway through the second act, I noticed that this movie wasn't going to escape the fact that it tries to tackle too many genres and tonally, it lacks a bit of balance. Going from such an intense opening act to a more slow-paced and dramatic story is a big downstep entertainment-wise. Even when the action returns, it's a totally different type of war action. Throughout the film, I felt like wanting a bit of ""that"" when there was too much of ""this"" and a bit of ""this"" when there was too much of ""that.""Nevertheless, Overlord is one of my favorite movies of 2018, and it's going to make my life hard at the end of the year, organizing my Top10. It's a brilliantly structured story filled with remarkably well-developed characters and a phenomenal cast, led by Jovan Adepo. Julius Avery provides a captivating and intense rollercoaster of genres and tones, delivering a film with very different levels of entertainment due to the many styles present. His filmmaking craft is mind-blowing, and J.J. Abrams' production is visually stunning, at least. Watch it on IMAX so you can feel how powerful and intense the sound design is. You'll be captivated from the first to the last second. Enjoy it!",Overlord

The film starts off with a high-action paratrooping event, then gets slow for a bit, till the big fight and explosion scenes in the final third. There were some genuinely compelling fight/horror scenes in that final third. Some of the horror makeup is Oscar-worthy. Not sure why they selected relative unknown Jovan Adepo as the hero but he wasn't really up to it. Maybe his ""Boyce"" character is best described as anti-hero since as an Army private he was insubordinate more than once.

105,CANpatbuck3664,"Overlord Balances Horror, Action and Drama and Ends Up Being A Fun Mix of Genres",8,13 November 2018,"The first thing that is going to catch your eye in Overlord is the beginning sequence. I'm not going to spoil anything but like many war movies before it (Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates etc.) Overlord begins with an action sequence that gives you a glimpse of how terrible the situation was for Allied soldiers coming into battle. I think that director Julius Avery and his team do a solid job introducing us to the main players in this story and then throwing them into an all-too-real situation that claimed many lives. We see this hellish event through Boyce's (Jovan Adepo) perspective and the chaotic nature of it is sobering. I don't think its on par with the storming of the beach in Saving Private Ryan but that's not a fair standard to hold every war movie to. Opening the movie with this stunt piece was a good choice and it made for a strong beginning to Overlord's story.The plot of Overlord is definitely intriguing but its really reminiscent of the Call of Duty video game franchise, especially zombie mode. I don't consider this an insult however, the movie never descends into all out camp (something my friend who I saw the movie with was disappointed about) and while you never can take it as a completely serious war drama, it straddles that line in an adept manner. Its a more effective telling of that kind of story and with the war/action scenes being well choreographed and filmed, it helps the story be a little more palatable. You get both sides of the coin with the mix of genres and while the movie is a work of fiction, they're building off a series of events that happened on a smaller scale (I've read books on the scientific experiments the Nazis conducted during WW2 and how they tortured their test subjects with little sympathy for those people). I would never call Overlord anywhere close to factual, but they embellish on something that went on and create an interesting story out of it.The cast of Overlord is filled with actors that you will probably recognize from other things, but you'll have a hard time remembering their names. Jovan Adepo does a solid job as Boyce. Boyce is the greenhorn of the crew and while Boyce comes across as a little naive, Jovan does a good job of portraying his horror and confusion at how the events of this movie unfold. Wyatt Russell also performs competently as Ford. He's building a varied and impressive resume and he did a surprisingly good job as the no nonsense leader of this crew of misfits. I hadn't seen Mathilde Ollivier before, but she also gets the job done in what would be a forgettable role in another war drama. She helps her character come across as knowledgeable yet sensitive enough to care for her family. I liked Pilou Asbaek quite a bit in his villainous role. I left Ghost in the Shell wishing he had more of a chance to shine but he got the screen time in this to standout. We've had so many performances of villainous Nazi commanders, but I think he brought something to the role of Wafner and he was a good fit for this movie. I also would like to say that while he walked the tightrope between chewing scenery and being funny, John Magaro was another bright spot as Tippet. The movie needed a performance like his to keep it from getting bogged down and he does a lot of the comedic heavy lifting.Overlord is a movie that doesn't have many obvious flaws or things I can gripe about. It never reaches the height of being unforgettable, but it never feels unfinished or less than complete. My biggest complaint is that the ending goes on too long, it builds up Wafner too much and while we get a couple of nice moments with Ford and Boyce sprinkled in, I think they could have cut it down and still gotten the point across. The next thing is that all the main members of the cast are given interesting backstories, they definitely piqued my curiosity, but I was a little let down when we didn't get to see any of them through flashbacks or that they didn't play any role in the story. The best movies show us these things instead of relying on just telling us, and it was a minor disappointment that the screenwriters bring these ideas into the movie without capitalizing on them.Overlord is a competently shot war movie that dabbles in both action and horror effectively. I've seen more shocking and scary horror movies and I've seen deeper and more effective dramas about WW2, but this is a well rounded and well put together movie. There is a lot the movie does right, and conversely the movie makes few missteps. I commented on the ending running long and drops tidbits of cool stories of where our characters came from without taking advantage of them but that's about all the negatives. Overlord hits hard, packs enough blood and guts to satisfy horror fans (even if the movie is never truly frightening) and is dramatic enough in some moments and lots of fun in others. This mix of ingredients won't appeal to everyone but if some historical science fiction mixed with some body horror and some action sounds like your cup of tea, I'd have no hesitation recommending Overlord to you.",Overlord
106,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,19 April 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""Overlord"" starts off with a blast and is a full-tilt ride until the very last scene. It takes a chapter out of Nazi medical experiments history and combines it with any good zombie movie to create this delicious slice of horror.We follow the exploits of a small company of soldiers who's job it is to neutralize and/or destroy a nazi radio tower located in an old church before the oncoming D-Day invasion. The story begins with a harrowing experience in the skies above France leading to some of them regrouping on the ground below to carry out their mission - aided by a very lovely, yet feisty french woman named Chloe. Our story's main character, Boyce, makes it inside the church to find some horrific experimentation being done with human prisoners. Soon, it becomes an all-out, embroiled battle against the evil nazi's, the evil zombies, and a race against time to destroy the tower before it is too late.I loved this movie. The story was well developed, the characters were strong - some even in their limited roles, the camera work and cinematography was excellent keeping you engrossed on what was going on on-screen the entire time. We've seen variations of this story before, but this was exceptionally well done with solid performances and awesome special effects, especially the transformation scenes.""Overlord"" comes with a high recommend to any wartime horror film fan.

In this alternate universe we are still facing Nazis at the cusp of deep American involvement (D-Day).
Not that we don't tread over well worn tropes, the set up itself doesn't lend itself to too many surprises. Nazis experimenting with town to make super soldiers ala ""Universal Soldier"" serum. The rest becomes gross out, brutal violent people doing dumb things in battle. And in the end...the effort is futile if not just for minute rest. A bunch of eye rolls aside, it does have entertaining moments. As others have mentioned, the opening sequence rivals ""Saving Private Ryan"" in its random death counts. Though upon hitting terra firma behind enemy lines, it drags. And...as our reluctant hero goes traipsing thru the catacombs of a French church, one wonders how he is able to duck and cover and explore making as much noise as he does and...laughably, at one point, a flashlight that would most definitely give away his position.

108,Aylmer,Where's the realism in my Nazi zombie movie?,4,26 June 2021,"While the film has good lighting and production design, things unravel quickly once you start to notice how ridiculously implausible so much of the film is. From the start, we're introduced to an airborne invasion of Normandy (keep in mind that the film is named after the operation) that happens during broad daylight and finally lands in the dead of night. Anyone with an elementary education would know that there weren't any daytime air drops on June 6th. On top of that we have strangely colorblind casting (which, though applaudable in concept, doesn't make sense in historical films) and characters having too long of hair and behaving too much like 21st century people rather than anyone out of the 1940's. What also kills me is the poor weapons handling on display, especially by the actors playing Germans. Only actors would fire full automatic from the hip when trying to hit targets at a distance. Oh yes, and apparently automatic parachutes that require hooking onto a line to deploy can also be manually opened after tumbling for 30 seconds.We're also introduced to our plot armored tough female character (so smart that she's able to immediately know how to turn on and operate a flamethrower upon encountering one) in a manner almost identical to RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, but with a hidden language knowledge reveal taken right out of the original INGLORIOUS BASTARDS. Does this pay off? Does her immediate chemistry with one of the soldiers go anywhere? Will you still care?I was most perplexed by the relaxed attitude of the German occupied town so close to the Normandy landing zone. Wouldn't the Germans be a little more alerted to allied soldiers in the town considering all the parachutes and shooting all around? Why don't they ever feel compelled to investigate the French house with paper thin walls from which shouting and the multiple gunshots seem to eminate?I guess you could accept this as a cartoon version of World War 2 right out of ""Hogan's Heroes"" or a Castle Wolfenstein game. Granted, the film would have done better had it leaned into the videogame route and just gone over the top and comedic with the violence. As it is, it tried to be shocking and horrific but in that regard it plays all its cards way too soon and doesn't pay off with anything. We never get to see the zombies fully run amuck and only really get to them in the last 1/3 of the movie. Lastly, though I can see why Kurt Russell's son was cast in a part that his dad would have shined in, he completely lacks his any of his father's charisma, delivery, or screen presence.Overlord is little more than an immediately forgettable dud.

112,sweidman-28016,Gory Action Horror,6,16 November 2018,"Overlord Review:Overlord is J.J. Abrams's newest movie directed by Julius Avery about a group of soldiers who's plane crashes into France the day before D-Day. While the find themselves in a small village, one of the soldiers, Boyce, played by Jovan Adepo, discovers that the nazis are doing horrific tests on people and basically turning them into zombies, thus creating an action-war-horror film. I was very excited for this movie because J.J. Abrams and also there was talk that this film was potentially in the Cloverfield universe. Sadly it wasn't apart of those movies, but I still feel like it is but they won't confirm it. I enjoyed this movie. It was full of action and suspense and gore, so so much gore, and I was on the edge of my seat right from the beginning. The story was very interesting and original. I don't think I've seen a movie yet where nazis do experiments on people. The actors did a good job with their performances, though I didn't think they were amazing or any of them stood out to me. I think I would've liked the characters more if they actually expanded on them, otherwise I didn't really care much for them. They would die and I'd actually be wowed by how they executed the deaths. There's one part in the beginning where Boyce has a locket and one of the other soldiers took it from him and he kept asking for it back like it was really important. It never went back to that so that scene wasn't necessary to me at all. There were a couple small scenes like that but they were drowned away with the rest of the story. This is one of the goriest movies I've seen recently and of all time. There were some bloody and disgusting scenes which you wanted to look away but you couldn't. This is a movie that nobody is really seeing with all of the recent big blockbusters. I enjoyed this more than most people and I think it's pretty good. They just needed to fix up with the characters a lot and get rid of some unnecessary scenes. Also the jump scares. There weren't many but they were unneeded. Other than that I think this is a solid film that won't be recognized at all.My Grade: B+",Overlord

116,Offworld_Colony,The first time I saw Overlord...,7,10 February 2020,"...(after a lot of hype and those great posters/advertising material) I expected a schlocky zombie pic with the crass but brief framing bookends and forced horror isolation of a failed wartime parachute landing; a sort of Call of Duty Zombies affair; Light on actual war and heavy on evil Nazi scientists and illicit experiments and grindhouse juice.My expectations were high that this would be good low-bro entertainment, bizarrely this was far from the truth; Overlord starts so fiercely and so specifically as a war film that the sedate tropes of the middle and the lunacy of the wishy-washy, gonzo monsters of the end, actually pale in comparison to the real horrors of war as opened up at the start of the film. (Also I feel asleep half-way through.)The horror elements are not interrelated the way that, for example, the internment camp was with prejudice and fear, race and otherness in the first X-Men. This film doesn't earn its interrelated horror and war. And it doesn't even have the From Dusk till Dawn bait-and-switch twist, which undoubtedly would have been a bolder choice, but perhaps wouldn't have worked better because, unlike Dusk, the lore here isn't good enough; isn't cohesive and explained to the right degree, and just isn't new or interesting. There's nothing cohesive in the horror design, no arc presented in the experiments, not even a team of Scientists, just one dude and one bad guy.However, this time knowing that the film was a war film with a couple of checklist horror elements in it, I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more. After the opening to near end, Overlord rolls through just about every behind-enemy-lines cliche but it's all exquisitely shot, all well edited, technically superb, with great use of locations, great cinematography and excellent music.But I couldn't shake the poor taste problem inherent with the war/horror fusion at this budget-level. A war movie with horror/gore elements is still a war movie - and a war movie should be about something important; co-opting the real events of war to make something not veined in honesty about human nature feels wrong, at least at this budget and level of po-faced seriousness.It seems like a B-Movie with a franchise budget, whereas something like The Void should have been given a higher budget, Overlord should have been given a smaller budget. The VFX is expert level, very effective on almost every account. And most of the script is enjoyable and it's a clear labour of love, it's just a little off.An example of it may be in that woman's head and spine in the lab; It was hilarious and spooky in just the right B-movie way! But some films would have made a set-piece around this moment, maybe the head-spine-woman starts to alert the soldiers to the invader's presence and he has to mess with the spine to get her to stop talking and she starts saying bonkers things as he messes with her nerves and such. Also the head would have been a captured beloved character from the start to make it more horrific. Whereas for 40 million dollars or whatever the budget was, there's always something else extra cool around the corner and nothing has to be expanded and worked on as to make them special, because the budget just allowed for something else cool.Still, at least give the director a videogame adaptation movie and he might do some good, Metal Gear Solid's already got Jordan Voght Roberts, but maybe give Julius Avery an Uncharted or a Last of Us or a Horizon Zero Dawn or something, he'd do it well.",Overlord

Dark, disturbing - an intelligent blending of genres.The start plays out like a decent war film - Saving Private Ryan esque but from the sky. In fact the first 45 minutes or so plays out like a war film, with a small group of soldiers on a mission to destroy a German tower to allow air support for the D-Day landings. It does a good job of being a straight up war film too. The chaotic opening sequence is brutal, loud and in your face. Considering this is more of a B-movie, I can only admire what they were able to do with this opening.What follows then descends into horror territory, delivering very well in this respect. There were some truly haunting and creepy scenes, the eeriness of which contrasts brilliantly with the chaos and scale of the opening scene and the sporadic smaller action pieces. There was a little reliance on jump scares at times to create the horror element, but I also thought Overlord did a great job of creating constant suspense. Things could have gone wrong at any moment and there was a real sense of this throughout.I thought the cast were at times a little hit and miss, but for the most part delivered, and the script, while derivative of the genre was solid enough. The characters were interesting enough if a little cliched.Entertaining from start to finish, Overlord builds off of a good concept and executes it well.

120,david-meldrum,Well Constructed And Technically Effective,8,28 August 2020,"Knowing the premise of this film before seeing it - which I won't reveal the entirety of here - my concern was that it could make Nazi evil appear cartoonish and outlandish rather than actually evil; this is by the far the first time in pop culture something like this has been attempted, and it's a hard trick to pull off without being crass. Overlord mostly works - it doesn't really reveal the extent of its hand until about the hour mark, by which time characters have been developed and Nazi evil has been established as 'everyday' rather than outlandish. It helps too that the film is technically brilliant - the physical effects have a visceral quality that gives the film real punch, and the peril of the characters we care about is real. A small but significant point for me is that in the night-time scenes of the opening act of the film, we can see what's happening - whilst still maintaining the fear and uncertainty of the story. Why more films can't manage this with night scenes has long been a mystery to me. The sound design works well also; this is a film that goes for several of our sense at once. Even after the hour and the film's reveal, much of what happens resembles more of a conventional war film than we might expect, but the sci-fi/horror is ramped up to a pleasing finale. It's not perfect - but it's more fun and exciting than I expected.",Overlord

123,stevenrotherforth,Every Home Cinema nerds dream,8,14 March 2019,"OverlordThe opening twenty minutes of Overlord would have you believe what type of movie this is going to be.
A barnstorming opening as soldiers are dropped into France during World War II.
Their mission is to take out a church which is a front for a Nazi communication tower.
As their plane is shot down in the epic first scene a group of surviving soldiers band together to carry out the mission but discover something rather sinister indeed.
From here the film takes a turn in terms of genre and it isn't the straight forward war movie you was at first led to believe.
Think Saving Private Ryan crossed with 28 Days Later or the Re-Animator.This J.J Abrams produced action/horror thriller is an absolute blast.
It's a very well made movie.
Director Julius Avery runs a tight ship keeping this film running at an exciting pace.
Even when action dips the director handles the drama effectively due to a impressive yet largely unknown cast.
Only Bokeem Woodbine, Pilou Asbaek and Wyatt Russell were identifiable.
Never the less the cast provide believable performances within a pretty unbelievable storyline.
As I mentioned. Overlord is well made.
This could be many people's new demo disc on 4K Blu-ray.
If the picture quality is good then the Dolby Atmos sound mix is bordering on reference quality. More on that later.
HDR looks splendid with green being the primary colour in use here.
This is a dark movie but detail is never lost.
There's not many 4K crisp shots but image quality is still mighty impressive.
A fine level of grain helps with the films subject matter and depth is stunning.
Some scenes particularly those in the farmhouse look almost as though they're in 3D.Right let's talk about this movies stand out quality.
Sound design.
As aforementioned this movie on 4K Blu-ray sounds absolutely amazing.
The Dolby Atmos mix is every Home Cinema nerds dream.
Bass gets really deep and punchy. Gun fire has a delicious tight thud with every pull of the trigger.
Explosions could crack the plaster in your living room and whenever someone gets hit the bass response is almost cartoonish.
Soundstage is wide and fantastic. Every speaker is working overtime with abundant over head effects and rear channels keep the eery creepiness of the films plot ever present.
I do believe that certain scenes are demo worthy.Overlord has impressive CGI too but it is perhaps the practical make up effects that along with the sound steal the show.
Some of the gory prosthetics reminded me of the good old days. Such as movies like The Fly or John Carpenters The Thing.
I thoroughly enjoyed Overlord. It's a movie that deserves a sequel but sadly I don't think we'll get one.",Overlord

Blasting a cast of relatively nobodies it's able to boast some solid performances from the likes of Russell and Adepo who carry most of the brunt of the film and end up with satisfying conclusions. A gritty and understated WWII film it truly makes the most of what relatively little is open for it, telling a claustrophobic and truly brutal story dabbling in exceptional body horror effects.

131,kgprophet,A Hybrid of WWII Drama and Horror,6,9 November 2018,"The opening of this hybrid movie is as visceral as the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan"". So much so that the violent deaths of the U.S. paratroopers are almost gut wrenching. Director Julius Avery gets remarkable performances in this gritty but human look at a WWII squad during the D-Day invasion. Then, perhaps in a Tarantino/Rodriguez style of switching from one genre into another, the mission transforms into another. Originally, the mission was to take out a German jamming tower on top of a church. But then it morphs into a discovery of Nazi experiments that do horrible things to humans.It is a strange juxtaposition of portraying war violence at the beginning of a movie as abhorrent and a traumatic experience. Then switch and put a spotlight on gory make-up effects, which would remind one of the gore in ""Day of the Dead"" or ""The Thing"". The switch from human drama to Nazi zombies takes it's toll on the emotional connections developed in the first half. The action quotient also slows down as the squad slowly finds out about the hidden lab under the church. Along with the leads, there is Mathilde Ollivier, a scrumptious young French woman who befriends the squad.The slow reveal involves her Aunt, in which a strange lapse in logic occurs. In one scene, the zombies are flame torched outside the lab. But it elsewhere it appears that the Nazis are injecting the locals and letting them return to the village. Nevertheless, when the two strands of the two missions are combined for the finale, a lot of confrontations occur, dragging out the big ending for a few more scenes. The main antagonist, a Nazi commander, is depicted as an homage to the late 1960's - early 1970's over-the-top WWII films like ""Kelly's Heroes"" and ""Where Eagles Dare"". The film takes only a few opportunities to callout those exploitation films, such as the titles. Instead, the photography, editing, and especially direction are not as superficial as those films were.It is that a compliment or a drawback? If I was to compare this to Robert Rodriguez's ""Planet Terror"", I would embrace the Rodriguez film because it packs the entire movie with callouts to the 1970s drive-in movie era. Here, an emotionally resonant drama is established and later undermined for the sake of horror thrills. I feel this only partially succeeds. Meanwhile no one can deny the extensive effects work that can be considered one of the big draws of the film. The camera doesn't flinch, both when seeing the grotesque transformation of a human under the effects of the experimental drug, and a ""Private Ryan"" moment when a fellow soldier has been shot and his comrades feel helpless as he bleeds to death.""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the top films ever made by Steven Spielberg, and has an emotional punch, combined with good-old big action set pieces. J.J. Abrams loves to give homage to Spielberg, but in this case takes memorable moments of drama and uses them as devices for this hybrid story. That for me is a mark against this film. It borrows moments from other famous films and doesn't necessarily pay proper homage to them. But on the other hand, I would find it hard to believe Abrams didn't give Spielberg a chance to review the script for feedback. Ultimately I was entertained, specifically by the lead performances, and mostly enjoyed the turn into Tarantino territory, it's just that I started to feel less attached emotionally to our protagonists as the monsters became more of the focus.",Overlord

Straight away we are thrust into the unimaginable intensity of WWII through the eyes of Boyce (Johan Adepo) who has to evacuate the plane his troop are travelling on after it is shot down by enemy lines. The troops mission is to take down an enemy HQ located at the church tower in the middle of a French village by 0600. Along the way they make some terrifying discoveries about what is being conducted underground. The opening sequence is quite remarkable and brings you into the setting wonderfully with a great 1940's style opening title and insane sound effects rumbling through the cinema. All the performances are great as everyone gives it their all, particularly Adepo, Mathilde Ollivier and Pilou Asbaek! The gory effects are pretty impressive and the 'subjects' in the film contort their bodies in such a way during their transformation that is gruesomely awesome. There are also certain images that stayed with me; a certain brief shot of a decapitated head was pretty disturbing but then again I've always found that kinda stuff creepy ever since watching the Goosebumps 'Haunted Mask' episode when I was little! Overall however, I came out of it still feeling a bit 'meh' which I think came down to the trailer giving quite a few of the spooks away and perhaps giving away too much about the horror side of the plot than it should of. If it had only shown the wartime theme without any gruesomeness it may have shocked but certainly impressed many viewers when coming round to watching the feature.

136,gavinp9,Great mix of a WWII film and some zombie scares,8,15 December 2018,"'Overlord' was the codename for the Battle of Normandy in 1944 - and that's exactly where the film starts, with some American troops on a plane crossing the English Channel. The first 15min is hectic and extremely realistic - possibly the best war opening since 'Saving Private Ryan'. The film plays like a genuine World War Two film for the first hour or so, following Ed (Adepo), Ford (Russell), Tibbet (Magaro), Chase (De Caestecker) & Rosenfeld (Applewhite) behind Nazi lines in France.They have a mission to blow up a Nazi communications bunker and are sheltered by Chloe (Ollivier), which brings some nice tension to some scenes. All the actors are good, and we get to meet the local Nazi commander, Wafner (Asbaek), who's set up nicely as the main bad guy. The team then have less than six hours to blow up the bunker before the invasion begins.Then the film takes a bit of a twist, elaborating on the rumours of Nazi scientists experimenting with all sorts of weird science - in this case they're working on some sort of Lazarus Pit which brings people back to life, once enough people are sacrificed. There's some gruesome stuff and plenty of blood - the R-rating's well-earned. It's well-paced, has an excellent score and it fun throughout.",Overlord

138,ritera1,Well crafted but a bit too comic book for me.,8,4 February 2021,"Thus, it was a bit soft in the horror. Tried for John Carpenter but lacked some of the grit he had, until the end.Moves very well from the beginning and establishes the lead nicely with very little dialogue by actor Jovan Apedo. His fear very clear and sympathetic. More quick establishment of the rest of the cast. Concise ticking clock was started and we're reminded of such during the film.(Odd that a bunch of first timers would be chosen for such a mission.)A quick glance showed me that 1 million black Americans fought in WWII. Was still thrown by a black man in Airborne and especially Bokeem Woodbine, although always effective, as commanding white soldiers. Additionally, nothing was made of our lead being black at that time although blacks did face racism within the ranks. Was room to show that.Although they did qualify that our hero ""barely"" made it through Airborne, really didn't see the Jewish character as doing the same. Then was a very different man when we met up with him later. For our hero it was a good starting point vs the complete arc he traveled.(I recall Unforgiven and Morgan Freeman's character being black as totally overlooked in a western, too.)This casting has been very common in past pulp sci-fi movies like this from Night of the Living Dead going forward.Very solid through the parachute jump into the small town. Tension was constant. The reluctant American soldier father figure to the young boy angle was very predicable. Good character element that the hero didn't kill the mouse.The Nazi commander ""raping"" the French woman sequence did well but was confusing when the two Americans caught him as was not clear that he had dismissed his German soldiers completely and for a specific period of time. Sloppy not to include.Nice device to get our hero into the compound. The scares and tension were a chunk less than I expected when he was in the castle and discovering the experiments. This was released an R-rated but felt it was on the low end of R.Surprised that the American soldier got the serum. Though for sure that the Commander would be injected.Room to foreshadow our hero's arc vs what war can do to a man (in the corporal character). But not done.The gore and grit did ramp up near the end when we saw the full injury to the German commander in the lab. A compelling brutality but not indulgent or violence porn. The someone is kidnapped (the boy) and we have to rescue him at the end (usually a love interest) is common and done here.Contradictory detail when the French woman is lured to a cell but the soldier is dragged in by the monster. Our hero and her leave the door open and run away, letting the monster escape. But these monsters have super strength and could have easily broken down the door.Overall very entertaining. Did miss details of the battered hero spittin' blood at the end (that Bruce Willis used to do well). And the last 2 epilogue scenes farted out with our hero's return and what he'd say about the German lab. I'm surprised they didn't tease a part 2.",Overlord

141,themadmovieman,"Starts out a strong war movie, but fails to keep up an engrossing intensity throughout",7,8 November 2018,"Combining the war and horror genres, Overlord sets out to be an intense and frightening watch, and although it starts in rather strong fashion, it's a film that just doesn't have the depth or unpredictability to really grab you throughout. Despite some strong action here and there, as well as a likable lead performance from Jovan Adepo, I found myself quickly tiring of Overlord, as it fails to really keep you in the dark about its greatest twists.Before we get into that, however, let's have a quick look at what works well about this film, starting with the opening act. Opening in thrilling fashion with a claustrophobic and intense scene in a plane above the English Channel travelling to Nazi-occupied France, the film continues with in impressively chaotic and action-packed fashion over the rest of the first act, as the botched landing behind enemy lines leads to more and more problems stopping the regiment from completing their mission.Director Julius Avery does a rather good job at directing some of the war action sequences, and while it's not quite Saving Private Ryan, there's an impressive intensity and grit to those early battle scenes, furthered by some of the more stark violence that the film is able to portray thanks to its R rating.Another plus comes in the form of the lead performance from Jovan Adepo, playing a kind-hearted soldier who is forced to rapidly adapt to an increasingly difficult situation. Although there isn't all that much to his character beyond being a nice guy, Adepo's performance effectively shows the young private's humility and bravery, something that makes him an immensely likable lead throughout, something that I really cherished in a film that doesn't have any other real characters.And that's where my first problem comes in with Overlord: the screenplay. While it is first and foremost an action-horror piece, the film doesn't have the relentless or jaw-dropping intensity of the likes of Dunkirk to completely forgo character development, and as the film draws on, and you're still left with a small crew of rather bland and generic main characters, the sense of threat and emotion at play really falls away, taking away from the intensity that the film is trying to create.Couple that with rather poor dialogue throughout, and you have a film that doesn't really have the depth or intrigue to keep you engrossed beyond a simple enjoyment of the action. Of course, there's no doubt that the film does a decent enough job with its action and horror, and as a more simplistic blockbuster, it does prove a fairly entertaining watch, however there's little more to it to really impress.Worst of all, however, is the fact that the big climax that the film is building to from the start is painfully predictable. If you've seen the promotional material for Overlord, then you'll know what I'm talking about, but even if you go into this film completely cold, there's so much blatant foreshadowing throughout that the eventual burst of action that the story is meant to be building towards doesn't feel particularly exciting at all.Overall, then, I found Overlord a bit of a disappointment. Despite starting in strong and intense fashion with a well-directed opening act, the film loses its way with a very poor screenplay and a painful lack of character depth, making it a less-than-engrossing watch throughout, even if it does save itself at times with entertaining action and a likable lead performance.",Overlord
142,kaptenvideo-89875,Everything you could expect from a horror action flick about Second World War - minus the thrill,5,7 December 2018,"With only hours until D-Day, American paratroopers drop into Nazi-occupied France to carry out a mission that's crucial to the invasion's success.But in the little village they find something far more mysterious and disturbing than anticipated.Starring a bunch of young talent that you have probably never heard before: Jovan Adepo, Wyatt Russell (the son of Kurt), Mathilde Ollivier, Pilou Asbæk, John Magaro et al. Bokeem Woodbine makes a nice but trivial appearance too.Do you remember the old saying, jack of all trades, master of none? ""Overlord"" is a good example of that. It definitely looks good, and the authors have dared to mix different genres such as action, horror, war drama - which is nice in itself.But the result is best suited for people who approach horror or B-films just as your truly approaches Adam Sandler's comedies: just happy to be there, the actual quality is somewhat less important.There's nothing irreparably wrong with the whole package, and it can certainly be enjoyable based on its yummy World War II-era period piece looks alone.But for a movie which success depends on offering cool-looking action scenes and creating suspense, I gotta it feels a bit empty on both departments.Action is not the main problem here. The opening setpiece on the plane is adrenaline-fuelled, surely one of the best parts of the movie. And we get some tasty bloodletting along the way, although after prolonged waiting.But what the story is sorely lacking, is suspense. Both raising and holding it.And how can there be suspense, if the story doesn't respect the very rules that it's based on? There is a very limited amount of time to complete the difficult mission on the enemy-filled playground... but after the opening setpiece and landing in France, there's never an actual sense of the central characters being in danger.They are in completely unknown territory but always seem to know where to go, or are followed by amazing stroke of luck which tilts the situation in their favor.Even shooting guns near Nazis - in a little Nazi-occupied village - is not a problem because miraculously nobody hears it. Or running around in a secret underground science lab where you have no chance of knowing where to go, or who can spot you where? Done and done!And because the screenplay says so, the characters' amazing luck just suddenly disappears in certain moments to introduce a place or scene that wouldn't otherwise fit - or somebody does something so unexpectedly ham-fisted that it seems unbelievable.Even worse, this awful time shortage mentioned right in the beginning never seems to be a concern. People have time to do whatever they feel like at any given moment.Less than half an hour before the mission must be completed, and we don't know how to do it yet, nor know the exact place we need to do it at? It's OK, I have other stuff to do anyway!Look, I get it. One shouldn't expect A-level storytelling from every movie, no matter how good it looks visually. But this doesn't mean that the viewer should accept any kind of solutions to major problems following the main characters.There are some great examples of B-movies being successful and able to keep the suspense despite what is essentially crappy storytelling.From what I've seen recently, ""Mechanic: Resurrection"" springs to mind. ""Overlord"", sadly, just pretty much fails in this aspect.So... if you like B-movies and/or noisy but empty horror, then ""Overlord"" is a good way to spend 102 minutes in front of the screen. For others, it may be just a bit too B, noisy, or empty.Oh well. At least we get a hint of how the long-rumored ""Wolfenstein"" movie could look like.",Overlord

147,songod-95003,Historical Rewrite,5,17 February 2019,"Sure this is supposed to be a horror movie. Had they set it in a fictional place and time maybe I could have gotten through it, but setting it during WWII on the eve of D-Day and featuring an integrated army of black and white was plan wrong. The army was not de-segregated till after the wear and even then the first mixed color troops did not fight till 1963. There were black battalions, but never any integrated with white soldiers.That the lead character is a black infantryman\paratrooper ina mixed race battalion makes this, for me, unwatchable. Not cause I am racist but because this is 100% historically wrong. That JJ Abrams and Paramount endorse it makes me think they want to re-write the past . Or they do not know history.Every scene I just keep thinking how wrong this whole film is. That it is some liberal Hollywood plot to ""blackwash"" our past. I mean sorry to tell you, but the big changes in segregation did not occur till the 1960's. There was no civil rights movement during WWII.",Overlord

Historical accuracy vs artistic license, The choice to make the lead, hero, moral compass, and the brains of this group black was bold and forward thinking. This is not representative of what happened but it is what would have happened if black soldiers would have had the chance to fight side by side. Just as smart just as brave and fighting for the same things as all soldiers. And this is in my eyes how most people feel today we are the same we want the same things. For me to watch this with only the briefest acknowledgement of race and to see from the beginning The units leader as well as the hero are black and not cartoons made this movie better.

149,austin0731,Aesthetically pleasing but lacks much in substance,6,13 November 2018,"Overlord was an interesting blend of Horror and War, it was gritty and intense which made it a good 'edge of your seat' watch. The characters were likeable for the most part, involving classic war movie camaraderie and peer banter. The characters grew and there was some meaning to there character arc. But honestly, overall quite uninspiring. The atmosphere was definitely done very well, the disgusting labs and the horrors of war were both depicted very well. The character design adn set design of the underground labs were all very well done.But unfortunately the film is not much more than that, the story is elementary at best and the mystery isn't really that much of a mystery. There was suspense, but that is to the most part due to loud bangs and body-horror imagery, that as I mentioned were done well. The story was very simple and overall the film had a very small scope, set within a small French village.However, despite this, it could be serviceable as a 'fun' watch, there isn't much depth, just a coo and action packed movie with intense fight scenes and is moderately enjoyable.",Overlord

Overlord is perfectly average popcorn entertainment for gore-fest die-hards. The screenplay isn't anything groundbreaking, it features the typical character tropes such as the idealistic protagonist, the no-nonsense leader, the wisecracking tough guy, the female love interest, the power-hungry villain. You've seen all these characters before, but the performances themselves are adequately engaging. They're plucky enough, showing off their occasional badass moments and spouting silly one-liners. Sure, some quotes are painfully forced, but Overlord is definitely a film that shouldn't be taken seriously. It's fully aware it's a dumb action flick and the characters are purposely written to be stereotypes with over-the-top dialogue.I think what sells the film is its genre-blending premise. Think Evil Dead meets Saving Private Ryan. Year after year we've gotten countless war films portraying the horrific carnage and its lasting effect on society and the human condition, but I think it's a breath of fresh air to finally see a war film that takes a more fantastical approach, shamelessly merging factual history with ludicrous mythology. American soldiers battling demons in World War II Germany is obviously nonsense, but what drew me deeper into the premise was the unknown facts behind the Nazi party at the time. We understand they were xenophobic murderers, but do we really know the full truth of what they were doing behind closed doors? For all we know they could've been attempting to generate some kind of super weapon that would've annihilated us and plunged the entire world into chaotic fascism. At this point I probably sound like a rabid conspiracy theorist, but it's food for thought. We've always seen the outside action in war films, and while tons of masterful works have come from that perspective, it was refreshing to see a more inside, abstract take on the war genre...as foolish as it is.
Many sequences were effectively thrilling, such as the protagonist sneaking through the Nazi compound, as well as the climatic battle with the demons, and I'm always a sucker for B-movie rank bloodshed, but I did walk out of the theater asking for more. I can't say it fully lived up to the trailer's promise. Overlord is not so much the horror film it claims to be. It's only got a few jump scares, but even then I saw them coming, and the special effects were more laughably half-assed than they were terrfying to eye. To be brutally honest, the CGI was pretty embarrassing, but that goes back to my previous argument that the film is fully aware it looks bad. If anything, Overlord is a blatant homage to low-budget horror cinema. That being said, I would classify it as strictly a ""thriller"". The kind that has you at the edge of your seat eagerly chowing down on overpriced popcorn as fists are thrown, guns are fired, and blood is splattered, but doesn't exactly give you genuine chills or warrants any nightmares later on.Sounds like a mixed bag, but I did have quite a ball watching Overlord. Heck, I'd add it to my list of guilty pleasures. Leave your brain outside of the theater for this one, folks. The film is not without it's painfully goofy and predictable moments, and I certainly wish it was a lot scarier, but it passes as a wildly entertaining, genre-blending popcorn thriller. Gory, intense, totally absurd, but above all: FUN. I'd recommend it any day over something pandering like The Grinch. Nothing says ""Happy Holidays"" than watching soldiers and Nazi demons paint the walls with their blood, am I right? Take it for what it is.",Overlord

165,scb_coldsteel,Call of Duty mixed with Castle Wolfenstein,7,3 December 2018,"So I saw Overlord at the theater. I always love a good zombie flick and the trailer of the movie made it look like some gory fun. Overall the movie played out a bit like a live action video game complete with a boss battle. Ridiculous but still a fun ride.The story of the movie follows a group of American soldiers in World War II on their mission to sabotage a Nazi radio tower. Of course along the way they encounter a secret Nazi plot involving how to use super soldier like zombies to take over the world. Along the way the movie incorporates elements of WW II action, black comedy, and gory thrills.In a lot of ways the movie felt like a fun video game escape. Make no mistake this movie is a fairly brainless popcorn film, but it was an entertaining one. The gun fights were intense and reminiscent of Call of Duty. The hunting down zombie Nazis was straight out of Castle Wolfenstein. The movie provided an ample amount of cheesy fun all around.The movie did do a fairly good job incorporating both a straightforward World War II war drama and a zombie thriller. Both genres seemed to complement each other well instead of feeling out of place. While the characters were far from original they still were likable and provided a few elements of humor to breakup the action and chills. The setting of the movie was also fairly diverse and provided something a bit different for the genre. Each environment felt like different level of a video game with its own unique elements and challenges.Of course this isn't the most original movie on the planet. The story is incredibly predictable and has been done countless times before. Plus the characters were cardboard cutouts of caricatures we've seen a hundred times before. There are good guys and bad guys who all have simplistic motivations corresponding to good vs evil. I would have also preferred if they amped the gore factor up and added far more zombie thrills.So I had fun watching this movie. It provided an ample mix of action, horror, humour, and most importantly fun. While not a video game adaptation it certainly captured the essence of what makes video games so fun. If you don't mind a simplistic plot with paper characters there is a lot of fun to be had. A 7.5 out of 10.",Overlord

Overlord takes place during WW2 where a unit of American paratroopers are tasked with a mission to drop behind enemy lines in France to take out a jamming radio tower atop a church. Simple enough, right? Wrong. This is where the entire film takes a huge departure from you standard WW2 war movie. From the initial scene, it hits you with a long action sequence that is intensely terrifying. From there the atmospheric tension continues and never lets up throughout the film. What should be a routine military operation goes horribly wrong. Overlord gut punches you with over the top brutality, violence, and gore, but it is also immensely fun and entertaining.

I saw it in a wide screen theater, and some scenes, especially the opening wouldnt have been close to as good without that wide screen and the audio booming through my skull. Some other great long shots that took a ton of skill to do, like that main characters escape at the end, were very impressive and gave a good tense sense of realism.
Other parts were very by the numbers and have been done before. And others were just very mediocre on the verge of face palm. Perhaps because I've seen a lot of zombie nazi type movies before, that may give a judgmental bias to my opinion that most wont have. The high quality doesnt distract me from the fact its dialog and characters dont stand up to a higher rating.
Im being quite judgmental with this film, since i went in expecting to be a 8-9/10 But its just not that. Its a solid 6-6 1/2. Worth seeing.

Increasingly unrealistic and unbelievable behaviour from protagonists and antagonists alike.

I absolutely loved the establishing scene. Sadly, it crashed shortly afterwards, and never recovered.I rate Overlord at 13.32 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a lazy 4/10 on IMDB.As an alternative I strongly recommend the excellent Frankenstajnova Vojska, which had a tiny budget that probably wouldn't even cover coffee for the film crew on the set of Overlord.This is an absolutely cracking little indie flick, with 100% practical effects and a whole lot of heart.

184,EasternZZ,"Should have been called ""Wolfenstein:The Movie""",8,12 November 2018,"If this movie was called ""Wolfenstein,"" then this would have been the first really great video game movie. This is pretty much just like Wolfenstein, minus Hitler and the main characters.This movie is very limited in terms of actual story. There is a story, United States Paratroopers land in Normandy before the D-Day invasion to destroy to place in order to allow the planes to come and give protection. They meet a hot girl, hide out in her place, plan their mission, and carry it out. There is no deep characters, the dialogue is hit or miss, with some pretty silly moments. Nobody really has a backstory beside one or two lines that other character says to keep us in check.The POSITIVES: There are two things in this movie that really stand out, the very first 10 minutes which is intense and really shows just how crazy the landing in Normandy was. You get to see what it may have felt like for a paratrooper to jump from a plane into Normandy, with the German shooting bullets and explosions everywhere.The second thing that really stands out is an escape sequence which is all done using one take. The camera follows this soldier as he is escaping a building that is about to explode and it is rather intense stuff.Another good thing about this movie is the action. When the action really gets going, it is a blast. The sounds of the guns are amazing, you see blood, guts, and all the cool stuff that comes with a B-action over the top movie like this. You also have a villain who transforms into a super villain at the end of the movie, a brutal hand to hand fight, some cool imagery, and a pulse pounding soundtrack.Now to the NEGATIVES; the second act is rather bland and kinda long. The budget is probably the reason why not much was happening, because the soldiers spend at least 45 minutes in this house not doing much besides talking, hiding, and beating a crap out of this Nazi guy. You get to see some cool stuff but I was actually a little bored and tired because it went on way too long. There is a moment where it looks like the movie will finally move away from this environment, but then 5 minutes later they just return back here and spend another 15 minutes or so stuck in this house talking. Also we have a character that is just an asshole because, well, every movie needs someone like this that we hate but eventually he does something cool towards the end and we are like ""ok, I guess you are alright.""Another negative is that there is not much action until the very final 20 minutes of this movie, but when it comes, they truly deliver though. Go in expecting this, so you won't be there sitting thinking ""Where are the zombies? I wanna see Nazi's dying."" Also there are not really a lot of ""zombies"" in this movie. This isn't a zombie movie, this is a supernatural action movie, just like the game ""Wolfenstein.""Overall I give this an 8/10. It has gory moments, a great introduction, awesome action towards the end, a beautiful girl with a flamethrower, evil racist rapist Nazis who spit in every scene to show you that they are evil, and an evil mad scientist. What else do you want in a B-Horror Action movie?",Overlord
185,nikitalinivenko,Inglourious Leftovers,5,3 February 2020,"Somewhere on the spectrum of pulp fiction, between the good (Inglourious Basterds), the bad (Iron Sky), and the ugly (any of the Ilsa sequals), Overlord dragged itself out of a Nazi lab that seems like the Christmas present Josef Mengele always wanted but never got. There are highlights (The strapped-in Nazi motorcyclist with a grenade shoved in his mouth, followed by our discount basterds picking off the survivors at the lab entrance) but the pacing frequently and unevenly dips thru-out the middle. This feels like one of those sy-fy channel originals but with a higher production budget. It had potential, but ultimately came to nothing, and I often spaced-out during. As a side-note, when I first saw the trailer, I legitimately thought it was a remake of The Keep. Fortunately it wasn't, though the set-up seems reminiscent: Nazis take command of a stronghold and unleash a Demon vs. Nazi's in an underground lab making superman-zombies. For a piece of loud, empty, MTV-editing-at-its-climax noise, this is a pretty well-rendered (and refreshingly, with a fair amount of practical effects), polished exploitation movie that could've been tacked onto the Tarantino/Rodriguez Grindhouse double feature.

A pretty cool combination of genres
Really nice effects, very consistently realistic or fantastical, depending
Most shootouts or action scenes are fun to watch
Pretty decent actingCons:
Really lacking in original or entertaining dialogue
Would've really liked to see more of the experiments, kind of begins and ends with strong and tough living dead
That one guy had a very annoying voiceBest part: using the serum on the soldier in the attic, pretty entertaining and a good reveal of the weird stuff going on

The white US troops were even more racist than the nazis who the black US serviceman were fighting. The fact there was only one black meant that he'd have been killed by the whites in his unit.The US military did not fully integrate its black and white troops intil 1954 despite the executive order desegregating the military was signed in 1948.,Overlord
189,gerry_barnaby,not perfect but ok film,7,8 November 2018,"First off there was a rumour this was meant to be the Fourth film in the Cloverfield franchise, I will say now this isnt connected in any way, this is a complete ultraviolent film that is nothing to do with the Cloverfield films.It's a good film but not original, as this film type has been done before in other films. It's imagination that was taken from Hilters days with the cult. Nazi scientist would do experiments, which is why this film has been done before even though it a good. The acting is solid along with the action which is sometimes intense, especial the beginning of the film as the film starts off by giving the audience intense battle scene in the Air, the film just spirals into mental madness with blood and gore from there.The film is very brutal I do mean brutal there are scene that a horror fan will love as well as some seriously messed up moments are on the line of being disturbing, with a Wolfenstein style concept which works, J.J Abrams being the producer you can see a lot of his style in this movie, which Julius Avery has done a pretty good job.It, not a perfect film not by a long shot, just could've been better in places.Dislikes:
For a horror film this was lacking in the zombies and monster that could've been added to the film with a bit more intense with hoarders of them, then this film would have been perfect.
This type of concept has been done before which might go against it.
There just wasn't enough Zombie creature action, felt too much like a War film than a horror film in places.",Overlord
190,tresm87,"Overlord is a perfect example of genre fusion consisting of high octane war action, and vicious blood soaked sci/fi horror that will be sure to satisfy audiences.",9,8 November 2018,"9.2/10 Originally slated as another production in the JJ Abrams Clover-verse, then changed to being a separate standalone film, this thrives with its own unique enthralling story. It throws the viewers right into the fire with an absolutely genius introduction sequence that truly immerses us in the midst of what D-Day would've felt like. The characterization is evident from the start and you really start caring for them early on and throughout, especially the 2 main protagonists played by Joven Adepo and Wyatt Russel. As the story develops you realize there is more to fear than Nazi's and war itself, and it goes into some very odd and gruesome territory with a triumphant heroic finale. The action is absolutely full throttle throughout the film and never lets up with some truly fantastic sequences. The set pieces as well as costume designs were all top notch and once again you feel like you're in that WW2 timeline. The biggest thing I want to talk about are the horror aspects which are phenomenally executed in moderation, and break away from tired ""zombie/infected"" cliches so well. They obviously loosely based this subplot off of the actual terribly bizarre Nazi experiments that went on in those times. Without giving too much away, I will simply say that the way they portray the mutated zombies is done brilliantly and actually quite effective which surprised me. They are way different and more complex than your average slow moving undead cliche zombie that we've been bombarded with over the years. The SFX as well as practical effects are astounding on them as well. Camerawork and soundtrack are all flawless and you can tell that Abrams had a hand in the overall Production with some of hisnsigmature styles. Julius Avery will be a director to watch after JJ has jumpstarted his career with this outstanding film.",Overlord

192,rmarkd,"Interesting and fun, but maybe a bit uneven",6,3 June 2020,"Overlord is a movie about a squadron of paratroopers trying to take down a Nazi communications tower so that the Allied troops can succeed on D-Day. Most of the squadron gets killed with a few ultimately surviving, including Boyce (Jovan Adepo) and Ford (Wyatt Russell). They, along with a couple other soldiers, continue the mission to blow up the tower and, along the way, meet up with a French girl and her son living in a Nazi occupied village.The tower, however, is more than for communications. Experiments are carried out to try to create super soldiers who can live nearly forever. This being a horror/gore flick, there are a few scenes of the experiments and failures.Add in a bad Nazi guy that turns into a zombie/super soldier, add some violent scenes, a couple jump scares, a couple twists, and there you have the movie.One of the early scenes is Boyce falling from the plane. That's, I think, the biggest highlight of the movie. I've never jumped off a plane in heavy enemy fire, but that scene sure did seem realistic.I liked Boyce's character. He started out as someone who couldn't kill a mouse, to a hardened soldier. The transition may have been a bit hard to believe, but I liked that it was a transition.Ford was good as a man on a mission. I would have liked a bit more backstory as he was so cold and determined that he could't have just been another corporal. Maybe they did discuss that and I missed it.The French girl Chloe (Mathilde Ollivier) was pretty bad-ass near the end. Points for that -- especially the flamethrower scene.All in all, not a bad movie, but too many parts seemed a bit drawn out, making the movie longer than it needed to be with time wasted on things that didn't matter. The end fight went a bit too long for my taste.Still, it's an entertaining movie for what it tried to be. They weren't trying to win any oscars, or push the boundary. They wanted to be novel enough so as not to be just another Nazi/zombie movie and I think they largely succeeded, although it's not like I look for these movies. I enjoyed it but probably would not want to see it again. So 6/10.",Overlord

198,mitchell5954,Fun Movie With A Good Mystery,8,14 November 2018,"Overlord is the latest film produced by JJ Abrams. With that and the positive critical reception the film has received I was really looking forward to seeing this. I'm a fan of JJ Abrams. I think he's a fine director. My favorites from him are Super 8 and Mission Impossible 3. I also like quite a few of the movies he's produced like Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane. I will say this is a good film. It's not great, but certainly above average.The plot is simple enough. It's set in WWII times. A platoon is tasked with destroying this certain Nazi base inside a church in France so that the ally forces can storm the beach by air. However, there is more the Nazis are conducting at this church than meets the eye.From the very beginning the film drops you and our lead characters right in the thick of things. The tension never lets up ever until the very last scene. Like with most JJ Abrams movies, there is an air of mystery throughout the movie until about halfway through. We're left to wonder what the Nazis' real agenda inside this church is. I won't spoil, but I thought it was a fairly good reveal when it happens.The film has great production value, and some decent action scenes. The cast does a fine job in the acting department. I do like most of the characters, especially the main one, Boyce. Even some characters I initially hated I grew to like by the end, which is a testament to good writing.Overall, overlord is a good, fun popcorn thriller.

Well it does not mean that he is missing, but since Fringe series in 2010-2011, finally in 2018 I can watch this kind of Sci-Fi movie that produced by him again. Overlord is high-tense, sensational, creepy, and could be re-produced as the next Netflix series. The acting of all actors are so great and firstly we can acclaim the next French popular face in Hollywood industry, Mathilde Ollivier. This movie is beautifully opened by some sort history of alliance invasion in France, so the audience can feel that this movie bring back the Nazi lab creepy story that can be everything inside, maybe zombie, ghosts, biological experiment, or other evil things. The Director shows up firstly about military mission that can wrap up whole scenes as one united part of reclaiming winning of their original purpose. This is the strength of the movie that the scenes line up with many plots, but the whole point is clear, for example in just seconds of scene, we already knew the meaning behind each motive. The grammar of scene of this movie is professional, so I can say that this movie is really made by matured film makers, not just ordinary film makers. I have no idea why there are reviewers who doubt of the movie and give less than 6 stars in IMDb. This movie deserves more than at least 8 stars. I give 9 stars, it could become 10 if the story is not based on the history. As long as the story is about history, in this case in NAZI, so we can still guess the ending. Besides, I really appreciate J.J. Abrams that could make this movie happened to be produced and make some differences among other movies nowadays. The genuine, strength, originality, moment of Sci Fi idea is still J.J. Abrams style that perhaps only few film makers could compete his works. Like other his movies, J.J. Abrams confirms his patience and curiosity beyond humanity because perhaps humans have potency to be eternal like god and win over angels, because we are over-lord, it means above everything on earth.

The comparison stems from the fact that what we have here is the combination of two movie genres: in this case war-battleground and indestructible monsters. Which is fine; the notion of zombie-like monsters playing a role in the Allied landings at Normandy might just be ... Ok. Add to that a thrilling first half hour during which (1) our heroes contemplate parachuting into Northern France and (2) do make the jump in a scene of fantastic graphical imagery, and then (3) face the enemy on land, and you've got the beginnings of something special.And for a while it is. For quite a while, in fact.The film's 'failure' comes in its final scenes. Without giving anything away it appears as though certain plot elements were edited out of the film. We are led to believe that the creatures are still in the process of being created; a force to be reckoned with in the future. But no. Turns out there's a whole lot of them ready to go. Now.

We all know it's fact the Nazis during WWII were up to no good, including many extreme experiments using humans as lab rats, this movie takes it and runs with it into an entertaining horror/action flick about what strange discoveries the Germans may have had. It's not as gory or as scary as one would hope for, I personally was hoping for something along the lines of John Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" and while they did use mostly practical special effects, and while it is action packed, with a good story, decent characters, and some good horror moments, it definitely lacks enough to classify it mostly as an action thriller and not a horror. Take ""Band of Brothers"" and mix it with either ""Blood Creek"" or ""Outpost"" (both 2008). Crazy lab experiments, great action and intense scenes, some decent horror moments, but it was mostly just an action flick focused on getting the job done, could have been a lot more scary and effective, but still a decent and worth-while watch!Definitely a few plot holes, like, what's up with the Aunt?

However their plane is shot down and the entire squad is slaughtered except for four soldiers. Now its up to these four band of misfits to complete their objective, but they accidently stumble upon a laboratory that the Germans are using to build an army of super soldiers and Nazi zombies. This whole concept sound like familiar to the plot of the Wolfenstein and Resident Evil video games and we all know how those movies turn out. But it was a surprising pleasure to enjoy with a bland concept, but it's more than meets the eye. It's not your typical war movie because it offers so much more and they don't focus on the horrors of war. Granted they do focus on the horrors of war, but its done in a different perspective that left me fascinating and intrigued if that actually did happen or if its just rumors. I'm not an expert on war, but I don't think that the Germans had the idea of creating Nazi zombies or building an army of super soldiers because that idea alone sounds completely far-fetched. But a part of me wants to know if Germans were really experimenting with American soldiers for scientific research. Overlord is not afraid to be a different war movie that what we have in front of us is a twisted version of Saving Private Ryan. And it feels good to have a break from all the classic war movies we've witnessed over the years because how many times do we need to hear that concept repeated to us again and again. If I could find a problem I have it would have to be that Overlord had a problem finding a balance between being a war movie and being a horror movie. To me I wanted to Overlord to focus on Nazi zombies because that's never appeared on the big screen. But for the most part the movie does a spectacular job of actually giving us this concept and turning it into something spectacular without it making it seem cheesy or over the top. So in conclusion this is a terrific war film with tons of horror and suspense and is definitely a sleeper hit in the war department.",Overlord

224,BiiivAL,"""Eternal Reich»",7,10 November 2018,"Extremely infrequently Western cinema in recent years pleases the mass audience with pictures of the Second world war, and most of those that come out, are not always really good quality. But even less in production and the final release of the picture comes with a similar setting, but only in the genre of horror. The last thing I remember, is quite ambiguous ""Army of Frankenstein"", which is also told about a group of American soldiers in a distant province stumbled upon a secret German laboratory, where he conducted experiments on people. But the film was something of a tough thrash, but the picture of Julius Avery was much more expensive spectacle, and coupled with all of the above components, we got pretty not hackneyed spectacle.A small detachment of soldiers breaks into the depths of one of the villages of France, which is a Church with a radio tower, which must necessarily be destroyed in order to German anti-aircraft guns could not bring down another allied air transport. The above squad includes the main character of the film - rookie Boyce. Almost all of his newly found comrades were killed during the landing on the territory of France, and he remained with corporal Ford, and a few soldiers-recruits. But ahead of them waiting for things much more terrible than just German soldiers.The ""Overlord"" is actually just a great opening scene, which is made damn expensive, large-scale and certainly high quality. This is the scene of course repeatedly demonstrated in various trailers of the picture, but it does not spoil the impressions of it when viewing. Everything explodes, people shoot and tear to pieces, all around panic and real hell, the picture immediately makes it clear that everything is more than serious. But in General, in the future, all the dynamics pretty much subsides, but it does not go into any huge minuses ""Overlord"", as what is happening constantly throws something new for the squad of the main characters. Despite the changing dynamics in a much smaller channel, the film tries to keep some intrigue, and the intrigue sometimes even manage to abide by it. The main problem of ""Overlord"" is the plot, which is needed here as if for show, just to show the extermination of the Nazis and other villains in the setting of the Second world war. At the same time, the picture is filled with some incredible number of stamps and completely banal types of characters. Here you have the rookie main character, which gradually becomes hardened soldier, but you are his commander, the man for whom to obey orders above all else, he loves to joke, and this behaves like an asshole, and of course nowhere without pavada. But about these things you often forget when the film reappears episodes with action, as well as the injection of a certain atmosphere.I am glad that from the ""Overlord"" in fact expect not so much, that is, you certainly expect a little more scale, similar to a larger action, but in principle, and that there is, in my opinion is enough for positive impressions from the view. Here is also important the fact that something like this comes out very rarely and perhaps this is the only opportunity for the next few, or even more years, to see the bloody action with the Nazis and ""zombies"" in one package. This of course is not so crazy spectacle as some ""Iron sky"", but noticeable pretty thorough approach of the creators, which is still worth praising.",Overlord

227,gluonpaul,Certainly better than most of the stuff coming from hollywood over recent years,7,11 November 2018,"So this movie is not without its flaws but even so gives a gritty horror story with a decent pace to the story.So the imperfections are hardly terrible, some of the characters are a bit 2 dimensional, for instance the main focus is some kind of perfect boy scout which is fine for a superhero movie but in a more down to earth movie just comes off as lacking real depth. Also our heros are apparently able to fight off dozens of enemies which also seems a bit ridiculous.Even so while these may mean this movie is not perfect the reality is its actually a pretty decent idea for a horror, well executed for the most part and makes you feel genuinely enthralled throughout. Well worth watching.",Overlord

231,rustonreviews,Chaotic carnage.,8,17 November 2018,"While on a mission to destroy a German radio tower located in an old church, a paratrooper squad are blown out of a war torn night sky. As bullets rip through the plane and explosions swallow many of the soldiers in a malevolent vortex of roaring flames, we follow Pvt. Ed Boyce (Adepo) in a frantic, harrowing tracking shot as he is ejected out of the plane and sent plummeting down towards the ground where he miraculously crash lands in a river. United with several survivors and stranded in the middle of a Nazi infested war zone, Boyce and the squad's last remaining troops continue their mission to bring down the radio tower, unaware of the sinister German experiments taking place beneath the church.Fusing comic book elements with gritty, unrelenting WWII action, Overlord is a berserk horror/war movie that throws us straight into the middle of the action within the first few minutes. What makes Overlord such a fun movie is its mad concept; Nazi's conducting horrifying experiments to create infected, unkillable super soldiers in order to win the war. Although Nazi zombies isn't exactly breaking any new ground (2009's Dead Snow and its sequel being the most notable examples), Overlord manages to provide us with a cast of likeable characters to root for, particularly Pvt. Boyce. Overlord packs some truly excellent set pieces, with the opening sequence being one of the films very best. Avery has a clear eye for action, and gore hounds will thrill at the levels of gruelling carnage on display towards the chaotic, ridiculously entertaining finale. It's a hell of a fun time, and undoubtably the most underrated film of the year. Destined for cult status, Overlord is essential for genre fans.",Overlord

Okay, you (we all) know it before go to the cinema, we know what to watch. It's like you don't like StarWars because they have Jedi abilities & light-sabres (you knew it before)...
...The problem is the horrible plot/scenario... and the super-bad screen-play.We have a small group of survived ""101"" US Paras during the night before ""D-Day"" (June 6 1944), which they trying to take out (destroy) a ""building"" (no further details from the movie!!!) that is important for the air-bombing success! (If you understood something, let me know! ""An important building against the allies' air-strike""... Totally childish. Not even a special weapon's artillery battery, that would make A PERFECT SENSE to the plot).
So, after the plain crash, a small group of survivors trying to continue the mission, while a battalion of Nazis is all around the area, but the survivors don't have problem to... argue in the middle of the silent woods (and no Nazi running towards that noise), stepping on land mine (and no Nazi running to see why a mine explode, while enemy planes with paras are flying over their heads!), etc.
The American troops arrived to a French village FULL OF GERMAN PATROLS (I counted over 20-30 troops patrolling the village streets), but the brave Americans made it to find refuge into a French house... the Nazis didn't arrested them... but THEY DID ARRESTED the French house's owner (a French girl)!!!!!! The Germans SPOTTED the ...girl, but not the 5-6 full-armed (and NOISY) American Paratroopers!
Then, after a while (and when Nazis let free the girl), a German SS Major arrives to the girl's house, obviously for sexual reasons (wanted to rape her). The Americans ATTACKED HIM... was a FIGHT between them... EVEN SHOTS (!!!)... but no German arrived to the house they left their commander!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...After a while and when the US Corporal send a trooper for... scouting (in the full of Nazis village's streets!!!!), the trooper ENTERED into a German truck and he... entered that way into the SUPER-DUPER ULTRA GUARDED facility (that wanted to destroy), he managed to go to the DEEPEST LEVEL of the facility and saw all what were happening there... and he DID IT OUT, ESCAPED, to give report back!!!!!!!!!!...Okay, I give up.

There is a mutiny in the American patrol. The black guy has a higher purpose than the mission...of course. From that point forward, everything just fails. 2 Americans take out 40+ well armed Nazi's. .We don't even know where they got their equipment. Is it American? stolen?

Don't get me wrong, the acting in this film is really well done, but not once did I care about any of the characters and I found the main protagonist extremely annoying. For the plot, I would say its pretty standard for a war film, except for a twist: there are zombies involved. But, the actual zombie plot BARELY show up until probably the last 30 minutes, and before that it's just the war story, so I felt slightly ""cheated"" when the film ended.

It's a terrific war movie, and a great horror film, perfectly blended together to make a nice smoothie. It's good to see films that this given a chance, even though no one went to go see it. It's so much like District 9 or Krampus, a hidden gem found amongst the rocks. Terrific acting, setting, sound design, effects, music, and a perfect balance of tone. I'm usually very glad to find a movie like this between the cracks of the bigger blockbusters. Much like 10 Cloverfield Lane or Color Out of Space, it's probably not advertised as much, and will slip past a lot of people, but I'm so happy that people take the time and effort to make something tasteful like this and with so much care. It's something rare, no big name actors, no saving the world or being terrible, it just respects the audience enough to make a great movie. Everyone would immediately think that a Nazi zombie film is totally ridiculous, but this one is the top of the heap, actually taking it seriously enough and not going over the top.

It is one of the better attempts at the nazi horror genre but it still falls short.I really dont know why an excellent movie with a rich story based in historic fact is so elusive, this one still leaves us wanting but it is, on a whole, a decent enough movie.MY only real gripe with this is the plague of social justice that infects everything coming out of hollywood at the moment.The lead character is supposedly a private soldier from the 101st airborne infantry on his first drop behind enemies lines in operation overlord. The snag is, that he and his platoon sergeant are african americans. There were no african american infantrymen involved in this operation so why are these two here?Not a word is said about it and of course the rest of the platoon accept them as if racism did not exist in the 1940's and it was all just perfectly normal (it wasn't).The two actors in question did a fine job and I was almost able to forgive the producers for this but I am still left wondering why a historical white persons role was replaced with a black person. It would never be considered that white actors should play the parts of historical black characters so it leaves me with the obvious conclusion that the inclusion of two black actors playing the role of white people in a historical event (zombies not withstanding) was a simple, misguided and futile attempt to be politically correct.I'll admit I was wrong when we see Matt Damon playing Malcolm X, Ben Afleck playing Mohammad Ali and Jesse Eisenberg playing Michael Jackson. Perhaps when they remake the next black slavery story they could cast some white people i amongst the other slaves.It would of course be unthinkable to do that so why do they think it is ok to do it in reverse?Keep politics out of movies, especially movies like this and if you want to have black actors involved then write them a part that makes sense and dont just substitute them for what can obviously only really be a white actors role.Better still, stop making race an issue at all.With that little commentary of the sorry state of hard left politics out of the way, Jovan Adepo was impressive and did not succumb to the temptation to overact or cheapen the story. He was measured, restrained and obviously a very capable actor who has control of the full range of emotions and skills that any good actor should.Og and this is the first WW2 movie in which nobody smokes., 1944 and nobody smokes cigarettes, yeah right (more politics)6.5 SS Cigarette Lighters out of 10.",Overlord
262,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,Inglourious Basterds meets Planet Terror and Dusk Till Dawn,8,15 November 2018,"After experiencing the disappointment of Cloverfield Paradox, I was very worried about Bad Robot's next genre film Overlord when it was rumoured to be another instalment of the Cloverfield franchise. Thankfull Overlord is not.On their way to destroy a Nazi radio tower to ensure the success of the Normandy invasion on the eve of D-day, a paratrooper unit's plane is shot down with only a few surviving soldiers left to finish the mission. Not only are they outnumbered and forced to hide within the French village the Nazi rule over with limited time remaining, the discovery of the Nazi's twisted experiments also puts them on a huge road block on their goal.Rather then just rely on creepy Nazi-bred monsters and zombies to sell the horror, director Julius Avery and his writers Mark L. Smith and Billy Ray smartly rely the horror of the WW2 setting to make you feel tense and scared, particularly in the beginning and ending with amazing one-shot set pieces. By establishing that any of these characters can easily die with a single mistake or if the Nazi catches them, the film leaves you with this tense, inescapeble atmosphere. While it takes a while, once the film's pure-horror elements arrive you can see Avery having fun with the scenes filled with messed body-horror and gore that are very creative and detailed. Avery also has a good eye for action with how dirty and intense he makes it while still being playfully inventive.What elevates Overlord just above style-over-substance is the attention to its characters and the performances by their actors. Jovan Adepo carries the film as Boyce, the only member of the unit who shuns violence. His lack of experience in the war causes him to truly see the horror of war that many of his more-experienced comrades choose to embrace. Adepo's nice-guy charm and reliability gives Overlord a character you can root for. In contrast is Wyatt Russell's tough-as-nail, take-no-prisoners Ford. Channelling the moxy and charisma seen in his father Kurt Russell from similar films like The Thing and Escape from New York, Wyatt Russell creates a flawed but also badass character from his own performance. Unlike Boyce, Ford is willing commit any cruel act of violence if it means the mission will succeed thus making him get close to becoming the very enemy he despises. Mathilde Ollivier also stands out as the French local Chloe who gets a couple of great moments against the film's Nazi antagonists. While Pilou Asbaek (Euron Greyjoy from Game of Thrones) just plays a very straightforward evil Nazi captain, he excels at portraying as being even more disturbing compared to the other Nazi in the film. There is a creepy scene in the film between him and Ollivier's character that I have seen draws some controversy so just to be warned.While Overlord takes itself seriously just enough to get you invested in the story and its characters, it is not as deep nor as artistic as say more prestigious war films like Saving Private Ryan. And its monster b-movie elements takes a while for it to become the central conflict which any monster and zombie fans may become impatient by. But at the end of the day, Overlord knows what it is trying to do and mostly succeeds",Overlord

Everything else about the movie is weak.I love exploitation, horror, B-movies and a ludicrous premise. This barely got its feet wet with any of those sub-genres. The dialogue was anachronistic, which would be fine if it leaned into the goofiness and had some fun with it, but the characters are cliches wrapped in cliches and say nothing of interest. There's not enough action or a wide enough menagerie of enemies to propel it into a proper creepshow. It's boring and the story is a hackneyed, heard-it collection of scenes ripped-off from other movies and (especially) videogames.The actors have nothing to work with, at all, so nobody stands out. The main character is somebody who grunts, coughs and splutters through every line and contrivance. After about 30 minutes you stop listening to anything anybody's got to say. None of it matters. The soundtrack adds nothing either, being the usual suite of drones and orchestral stings.This is a movie which needed brave choices, original scenes and outrageous amounts of silly, over-the-top gory fun. It pulled its punches and had nothing to say. It didn't need to be a Romero-style satire, but it did need to be a tale with some sort of point. It doesn't have one.",Overlord

269,toonyjakes,Fuels my faith for modern cinema,9,14 February 2019,"I may be crazy, but it seems that alot of people compare this film to Call of Duty just because of the WW2 setting alongside the supernatural elements it presents. I think those people are dead wrong, there's nothing here that resembles a videogame or even inspiration drawn from one at that. Overlord is dope.Plot- Relatively simple. Airborne sodliers land in enemy territory to complete and objective, only to stumble across a deeper more sinister secret kept by the Nazis. Lets clarify right now, this is not a zombie flick. You will not see hordes of zombies running into automatic fire. This film instead aims to thrill you with suspense, horror, close calls, and driving forces against the characters.Writing- Solid screenplay, didn't find one bad line really. Maybe one that sounded clichè but nothing that breaks character. Has one liners that make you go ""uh oh"" every now and then. The film is really more about the story rather than just chit chatting all night. We get characters with different roles, and see how they deal with the many issues at hand.Characters/Acting- The characters are definitely believable, and the casting was great. The corporal in the film is bad to the bone, and the actor that plays him is a versatile newcomer. The main character, Boyce, is played with perfection. Didn't quite find one that interrupted the flow aside maybe the Brooklyn-esque dude, but he becomes likeable.Quality- The film is visceral, gory, realistic, and intense. The sound is amazing and is utilized appropriately at all times, the filming has a certain focus to it. Really loved the opening title done in an old school format.Overlord may not win over everybody, but I can assure you that it's definitely one of the better films I've seen in the genre, particularly speaking of this generation in cinema. I was clapping for most scenes- it's a film that respects the characters and gives all them common sense. If you want something intense yet also scary, go pick it up. I know I'll watch it again.",Overlord

And not the trashy good kind.,2,15 February 2019,"Where do i start...Ok ive been looking forward to seeing this since i saw the trailer, i thought it had potential to be some decent entertainment.Lets start with the germans, to be clear i am german and i am quiet used to american propaganda and how they portrait germans etc in movies. And i am mostly fine with american patriotism and that we are always the baddies.
But in this one it was a special kind of stupid. Sure it is fiction but it doesnt even make sense, they portrait them as pure evil and not even close to a normal human.
The problem with that is that a lot of people are simple enough that they take this for real.Well whatever, lets discuss the movie.
First third is totally useless and is supposed to introduce the characters. But you never really care about them at all.
The transition period is just boring and stupid.
Then the Zombie stuff, why we are here...kinda alright i guess. Nice gore. But the story is still makes no sense at all.
In the end you just got the brutality and fights to entertain you.
Overall too trashy to be any good.

273,dashtag1234,Not What You Were Expecting,7,11 November 2018,"I walked into this expecting a ""Call Of Duty: World War 2 Zombies"" movie but instead it's a Saving Private Ryan wannabe movie with some zombies. That's not really a problem, either way it's still a fun movie. But that's it.The premise is interesting, the Nazis have some secret stuff going on and the Americans accidentally discover it. The plot is thin and mainly relies on the gore and loud noises to keep the movie going, which makes the movie a loud gore-fest. I feel like the writers could have made the movie more of a narrative rather than a mystery about zombies because while we follow one character for most of the movie, he never goes anywhere with his personality traits. He stays the same, and the character he is in the beginning and end is what he should have been in the end.In a lot of the scenes where they discover the zombies they show many brutal and gory images that really make us wonder ""what the heck are they doing?"" Rather than bringing this plot points back they throw them all away and explode some heads to make us forget about it. I'll admit, I had a good time at this movie, for most of it, even when the scenes were dumb and hard to believe I enjoyed it. I was entertained, which is all you really need. But take a look at other war movies, and even other zombie movies. There is a personal connection between characters, like Saving Private Ryan. That film is more intense and more violent than this one and it still has better character relationships.The movie is rather predictable and doesn't go anywhere, but that's fine, because in the end this movie might as well have happened in real life. It has some good direction of the war scenes and describes the horror of war quite well, but it's not really the best thing we could have released over Veteran's Day weekend.",Overlord

You get Overlord.The movie actually is pretty well-paced and presented, and the effects and action is pretty good. However, it might be too much on the horror, thriller and drama side and also too intense, thus after a while I was reeling from the blood and gore, and feeling disgusted.

What an amazing experience! First rate film craft at every level.The story takes it's time to build character interest and with quality writing and performance to hide the seams the narrative holes typically felt by schlock-B-movie concepts which mix genres (War/Horror).Instead of over-investing in the horror element or resorting to boo-surprises at the expense of storytelling as many films do in this genre, here the viewer experience the horror in context with down-to-earth issues (what is human/inhuman in wartime) and with events in real history - it was refreshing to see that the story never allows the intensity of the horror-problems to outweigh the historical significance of Operation Overlord and it's real-world meaning.There are plenty of things to critique about this film from a nit-picking level (as in, where did this come from? How was that possible?) but I loved that they didn't succumb to the temptation of trying to over-explain or give the audience time to nerd-out at the supernatural details but giving them something more grounded to be concerned with.

298,cinemawithcj,Overlord - Cinema with CJ Review,6,1 December 2018,"Overlord is a film where if you've bought into the concept a bit too much, you will be disappointed.It's a film where it sells you on an 18-rated film that promises war, gore, and even Nazi-made zombies, but barely buys into the genre-shift enough to really enjoy it.On paper, it works. Billy Ray's story brings together two brilliant cinematic ideas that are rich in the world of video games and are no-brainers for the world of cinema, but the chocolate-meets-peanut recipe isn't quite perfected here.Julius Avery's direction does work for what you do see, though. He creates a competent war movie, even if the scale of it feels very small (even if the hook of it is blowing up a communication tower to open the gateway for all of D-Day). It is brutal and visceral in the first act, giving us the horror and random fate war gives.For a war film, it nails that vibe throughout, even if it does feel way too familiar. It is weird that when it finally gets to the switch in tone, it feels like it starts to hold back.There's a feeling of unfortunate restraint with Overlord. You can't help but want a From Dusk till Dawn, but you're never going to get it.In that movie you get two very strong genre voices with a perfect genre flip that leads to such a brilliant B-movie feel. It's hard to separate the feeling of From Dusk till Dawn to the constant tease of Overlord.It just feels too packed and top-heavy. It could have easily been a man on a mission movie turned survival horror, and even when you feel like you get a crescendo, it's far too late.Overlord doesn't feel exciting or drastically different enough to truly recommend. For every great beat of it you feel the echo of an even better film. For every idea you have of what happens next you get the off-brand version of it. It holds you through the runtime but you're never really excited. You're never on edge at the rise of the film like you are when anything could happen at the very beginning. Overlord becomes too safe for too long, wasting so much potential in becoming your next favourite midnight movie.It's a shame, but if you still feel you have an itch to scratch, don't worry. There's a ton of other movies to check out. And games.But really...just watch From Dusk till Dawn and remember how much of a masterclass that movie is.",Overlord

300,pinemaples,Wolfenstein: The Movie,10,30 November 2018,"Overlord is the incredibly, gleefully R-rated war/horror movie directed by Julius Avery and produced by JJ Abrams, about a small group of soldiers on a mission to take out a German tower on French soil during WWII.
Jovan Adepo stars as Ed Boyce, a young, fresh-faced, and kind-hearted private just trying to survive one horrible night. The rest of his team includes, among others: Wyatt Russell as Ford, an absolute animal of a man, John Magaro as Tibbet, a motor-mouth without a filter, and Iain De Caestecker (best known as Leo Fitz from Agents of SHIELD) as Chase, a war photographer who's too pure and innocent for this world. Mathilde Ollivier excels as Chloe Laurent, a headstrong young woman trapped in the crossfire covering her small village occupied under a Nazi force led by Pilou Asbæk's insanely hatable villain, Wafner. Also worthy of mention is Bokeem Woodbine as Sgt Rensin, who despite his unfortunately brief screentime, left a big impression on me as he fused elements of Sgt Apone from Aliens and Lt Aldo Raine from Inglourious Basterds into one utterly memorable force of nature.
The movie opens with one of the most smotheringly intense airdrop sequences I've ever seen in a movie that blew me straight to the back of my seat, where I remained pinned by the rest of the movie's oppressively Wolfensteinian atmosphere. The film rarely lets up on the tension as roughly 90% of the movie keeps the camera closely trained on Boyce like a rail shooter from the arcades. The horror imagery, while wisely sparse and delivered in well-paced doses, is gruesomely and powerfully realized, serving to keep us on our toes and hiding behind our hands, peeking at the blood-soaked screen from between our fingers. The second act in particular caps off with one scene I will never forget, wondering when it was going to end, and not sure I ever wanted it to. I won't spoil it for you, but suffice to say that I won't ever look at Fitz-Simmons the same way again.
Overlord is often hard to watch, but in a very good way, and the 2.5-hour runtime blows past you faster than a bullet through a Nazi zombie's head. This is one movie I cannot wait to own on blu ray, as I will definitely be adding this to my annual October horror regimen.",Overlord

302,GoldenBlunderbuss,A great blend of genres (each done well) - shame about the final 30 mins,8,6 November 2018,"If you want to go in to watching this film without seeing the trailer, then don't read any reviews - including this one. There are no spoilers beyond what the trailer shows.I make that opening claim because if you hadn't seen the trailer, you wouldn't know of the dual-genre nature of Overlord. The genre shift to full-blown 'zombies-but-not-quite' action comes after 75 minutes of truly brilliant wartime drama with some moderate scares. The opening scenes of the paratroopers entrance to the war-torn French countryside is a particular highlight for its chaotic, intense and disorientating depiction of what it must've been like for those who did the deed for real in WW2.The horror element begins to build early on but is never an indication of the upcoming genre shift (if you've not seen the trailer, at least) until the point (From Dusk to Dawn style) where it's made clear that we're not in Kansas anymore. The only bummer I can think of is the film falls into the trap of a predictable final 30 minutes. With all the enjoyment had before then, it's so disappointing to feel let down at the last hurdle.The soundtrack is immense, the cinematography is brooding without being dark (a style which works for both of the film's genres), and the CGI special effects are affectingly convincing. Don't expect great things from the script (which includes several awful one-liner comebacks), but I think this film will go down as one of the great zombie films of recent years, and may even be noted for its even better turn as a war film.Best quote: ""What is this?!"" - ""Our greatest achievement.

Definitely NOT scary or gore filled, and with the $38 million budget you'd have expected A LOT more!The opening 5-10 minutes the reviews have been raving about was ok, its not an opening that would warrant a cinema visit, it ain't no Saving Private Ryan, Edge Of Tomorrow, etc battle scene, as it's over in a flash, roughly 1 or 2 minutes of action, pretty much whats in the trailer and the rest is characters chatting! Then it quickly slows to its meandering pace, with been-there-done-that scenes with added cheese and cliche characters, which start to wear your hopes for a fun big budget B-movie way he f down. I just became bored and just hoped for an outstanding action filled and creative finale to win me over. But NO, the ending is just standard gun play, explosions and one fight that's over way too soon and that's your lot! I would have been satisfied if it had maybe matched an exciting Expendable's type finaly as it was a similar premise.It's a film that never takes its idea's far enough, never too crazy or too gory but just a very controlled and safe 18 certificate B-movie. And it's a movie that mostly relies on the stupidity/naivety of its lead character to make the plot move forward.

312,Andrew_Wiper,"Overload I mean Overlord.. Fun, over the top violence!",9,12 November 2018,"Overlord directed by Julius Avery (Son Of A Gun) was quite a blast to watch on the big screen. The opening sequence is worth the price of admission alone. From there on the movie just goes and goes! It was intense and suspenseful for nearly its whole 1 hour 50 minute running time, allowing you to regather yourself for 20-25 minutes in the first half before getting back to the action and bloody violence. This is a world war 2 movie. They could of easily made Overlord into simply that: a war movie, but they take that and turn it into something else.. A Nazi war movie with a few crazy looking zombies. I really enjoyed the score. It has very suspenseful music and they fit it perfectly into certain scenes. I love how the cast aren't well known actors either, with the exception of Wyatt Russell and Bokeem Woodbine, the rest of the cast is relatively unknown, though you may recognize a couple of actors. Pilou Asbaek who plays the main bad guy is a great villain and he was in Game Of Thrones so I guess you may notice him as well. All in all a great horror/action movie and if you enjoy this you should check out Blood Creek and Dead Snow! Somewhat similar movies. 8.75/10",Overlord
313,DylanAnglin,Overlord Review,8,9 November 2018,"Okay, first off I want to say that this movie almost has the best opening title sequence I have ever seen. The film follows a group of soldiers as they try and shut down a tower occupied by the Nazi's. From there, all hell breaks loose. The film starts off strong, but struggles as it progresses. It's like a slow burn that picks up, but then slows back down as the movie moves forward. Sometimes it can become inconsistent, but gets made up for by the great acting and awesome atmosphere. Overlord is a fun take on the ""Nazi zombie"" genre even if it's slow from time to time.",Overlord

If I wanted to see some WW 2 action I would have watched the Combat TV series on TV. This script had endless possibility. I can go into them I guess but they took the easy way out.

It's a combination of well shot action, battle scenes, which btw no less realistic than any dramatic WW2 movie, and zombie like grotesque used-to-be-humans creatures. Add just enough suspense, grit and bit of humor, and it's a well balanced flick. This reminds me of old Wolfenstein game of 90s.

His team is hysterically 2-dimensional and comedic during intense moments asking yourself if this is a comedy or a war movie. There were parts that left me squirmish because of intended rape. But probably the worst combo came from a dull movie with plenty of jump scares. No build up just jump scares out of the blue. Of course the movie often relied on the stupidity of characters to make the plot moving forward.

Instead it mixed a riveting war operation with a campy B drive-in no holds barred action movie.I may be in the minority: I would rather see films like this (that take risks even though it's just bonkers) than another PG war film like Dunkirk (which felt like a great premise aimed at Oscar bait and mass audiences).A fun ride and up there with films like 300 and Bone Tomahawk.",Overlord

330,Krush_Burner,The Most Expensive Nazisploitation Film Ever Made,8,6 November 2018,"This is not the first time when J. J. Abrams put the finances into the risky project (remember ""Cloverfield""), but this is definitely a curious choice for such a filmmaker. ""Overlord"" is the rare hybrid of a WWII film and a zombie horror - kind of movies that were prosperous back in 1970s and early 1980s, but has been long gone since then. And even in those times most of them were cheap and cheesy exploitation films, full of gore and nudity. (And yes, lots of people nowadays will think not of grindhouse cinema, but rather of ""Call Of Duty"" or ""Wolfenstein"" game series, which is an obvious point of reference here.)And ""Overlord"" nearly perfect in assembling those pieces of a Nazi zombie horror movies into one single story. The plot is simple, action-packed and has it all: lots of fighting, shootings, machine guns and flamethrowers. The characters are schematic, almost one-dimensional, because it's not WWII drama, and that's enough. The SFX are great, there's a lot of blood and guts here, exactly what one can expect from a film which involves Nazis, experiments with (un)dead, and covert military operation.However, there's some minor but annoying mistakes in presentation of some important plot elements, which hard to left unnoticed. Perhaps the most striking example of such retroactive anti-militaristic message is when Cpl. Ford decides to stop Nazis once and for all near the end of the film: his attitude looks a bit anachronistic in 1940s and such views for an U.S. soldier were much more credible rather after Vietnam War than during the WWII. There's also a very implausible fight between two main characters before the final onslaught, which looks ridiculous within the context of the upcoming Overlord operation.But it all can easily be put aside, because ""Overlord"" is the Nazispoltation at its best: dark, bloody, action-driven horror about zombie soldiers trying to take over the world.

335,csj123,I liked this better when it was a movie called Frankenstein's Army,2,16 February 2020,"I guess this is what we do nowadays. We see a piece of work someone else has created, rework it, then call it our own all the while pretending we knew nothing about that original piece of artwork. For example: 'The Hunger Games' is a total rip-off of a Japanese movie called 'Battle Royale' but the author pretended she knew nothing about the original movie. Overlord is completely ripped off from a movie called, 'Frankenstein's Army' that was far more interesting and far more scary movie. 'FA' didn't have a huge budget like Overlord, but managed to be a far better movie. And the plot is nearly the same...but Overlord made additions to be a deeper film that made no sense. The 'FA' filmmakers didn't waste time trying to make social statements or worry about their characters unnecessary development and backstory like Overlord attempts to do.First off...Overlord is full of historical inaccuracies. A mixed race platoon in the Second World War simply didn't exist. Does it matter? Yes and no. It is a stupid throw away horror movie but we should be accurate about period pieces. A simple change to the story could have had the unit be an all black unit and then It makes more sense. That was only the start of slopping writing though. This also included terrible dialogue, unrealistic fight scenes, and even unrealistic non-fighting scenes. There are several scenes where characters are yelling at each other while hiding in woods crawling with Nazis and an attic in a house where nazis are wandering the streets. But... no one ever seems to hear a thing. It is laughably bad.The direction is fine...the cinematography is fine...the costume design is fine. But that isn't enough. At least have the movie make sense. It is woefully predictable and when it isn't you have characters doing things they never would do. The Germans seem bumbling...not creating a scary foe. While the Americans, upon seeing monsters, seem barely scared at all.I can forgive the historical inaccuracies like we all must do in Tarantino films. But what we really want to see is the monsters...and they are boring. The creations in 'FA' are terrifying bits of man, animal, and machine where you cannot tell where one ends and the others begin. I expected to see a low budget B movie and found a truly unique terrifying film. This Overlord rip-off relies on basic make-up and computer effects to come up very short.One cliche after another...you know who will live and who will die. You know what characters will say before they say it...and it is always awful dialogue. If any review is more than a 4 on here...ignore it.And to really stomp on the historical accuracy of the film we end with a rock and roll song followed by a hip hop song. It is 1944 people...come on. You are not even trying to make a good film.Find Frankenstein's Army and watch that instead. It is a better plot, better dialogue, better acted, better special effects, better atmosphere, and a much better movie. It is will give you nightmares...and that is why you watch horror movies...isn't it?",Overlord

28 days later is still a getter film but this was good fun and anytime you get to off a bunch of Nazi's (National Socialist German Workers Party) soldiers its good clean fun.The casting of african americans was historically inaccurate in this film.....
At the time the policy required segregating black soldiers in the armed forces, there were no African-American infantry or paratroops landed in the Normandy invasion.
In northwest Europe, African-Americans didn't reach infantry units til late in the war, & then it was a matter largely of desperation. US infantry casualties during the campaign in northwest Europe were very high, especially in & after Normandy, during the fighting in the Hurtgen Forrest, at the Siegfried Line etc.
By 45 the US was running out of qualified infantry replacements & thus they turned to African-American support units for volunteers to go into the infantry. Thousands of african american troops volunteered to go.",Overlord

No one is really likable aside from Boyce but even his timid stammering at times makes him kind of a meh character.

345,utslitt,"Fantastic Concept, ""Eh"" Execution",6,22 July 2019,"I've had this movie on my ""watchlist"" for forever now, so I figure I'd put it on as all the trailers I'd seen were good and I didn't really hear anything too negative about the movie. After watching it, I had some thoughts and concerns I feel as though should be mentioned. Spoilers ahead.First off, the movie opens beautifully. We're introduced to the majority of the characters we're going to follow throughout the movie and feel just as tense as them right before they're thrown into the thick of things, without even truly knowing just how ""thick"" things are. The entire plane scene, as well as the leading up to meeting Chloe progressed well. That's about where the movie stops progressing well.The introduction of Wafner, the interrogation scene in the attic are both a little drawn out. They just keep happening without giving any real value or progression to the plot of the movie. Yes, we know Wafner is a bad guy, ""U-S-A, U-S-A"", blah blah blah. These two scenes do nothing more than just establish who the main villain of the movie is, and ensures us that whoever Wafner is, his capture in the attic isn't the last of him.The church scene was interesting and had beyond stellar special effects. It also did a great job at instilling that suspense into the viewer, a real strong ""what the heck is going on"" sort of vibe that engages us in a way that has us hooked for more information. The problem with that, no information is ever given.... ever. It's a shown concept that there's some super serum being developed, this same serum the one Wafner is interrogated over, but we know nothing more about it for the rest of the film other than ""it hasn't been tested on live subjects yet.""Chloe's aunt - probably the biggest missed opportunity throughout the entire movie. They briefly introduced a character bringing along a huge breezy draft of mystery and curiosity with and for her, then don't touch on her at all after that one scene. What was even the point? Just to show how invested Chloe is in wanting revenge against the Germans? We already know she's pissed at them for invading her town and killing her parents, so why was the aunt even in the movie if they had no plans on her actually having a more prominent role? Am I missing something? I've even discussed this with others who seen the movie and they feel the same way, so if there was a message or vibe that Avery, Ray, and Smith were trying to send the viewers way, it was definitely missed.Lastly, throughout all this malarkey only one character has any character development at all. Just one. Again, I'll repeat that. With all the characters introduced in this film, only ONE of them gets any character development and it's the obvious development of ""couldn't kill a mouse"" to ""saves the day by killing the bad guys"" progression. The lack of creativity here was truly painful.Despite all of my complaints, this movie was entertaining to say the least. I could see myself watching it again after a good while (more than likely with company rather than alone) due to the stunning visuals and interesting concept. It just left quite a sour taste behind afterwards because of what was left unsaid as well as how much better it could have been if they'd taken just a little extra time to work on a few things.",Overlord

Great creepy violent fun with just enough humor and characters who didn't make as many bad decisions as most horror characters. But speaking of bad or at least confusing decisions, I didn't understand why the leader character is black. There were no black paratroopers deployed overseas in WW2, so that decision leaves me stumped, especially since changing the race added nothing to the story, except maybe why he could speak French. Also, what's up with using a rap song over the ending credits? It's a film about World War II during the 40s and they decide to plop in a music format with lyrics that have absolutely nothing to do with that time period or the plot? Dropping in disco music would have made as much sense. But, miscast lead and disruptive song choice aside, it's a terrific film I highly recommend.",Overlord

We don't feel anything for the characters, and the much-awaited showdown between the 'good guys' and the zombies does not really happen the way I was expecting it to.It's a pity because Wolfenstein did all this way better years back and I was really looking forward to a horror movie with a WW2 setting, not a WW2 movie with a tentative dab into the undead.Final verdict: Just entertaining. Just average.",Overlord
355,iamdcontingency,Silly at first but redeemed itself,6,3 November 2020,"I didn't really fancy the movie at first because it's relatively unknown, and when I began the movie I felt like I was right. An African-American soldier? in an all-white airborne platoon? with a black sergeant? in WWII? Nah. The political correctness was ridiculous and it nearly cost me my faith in the movie. (Seriously if they wanted to put a black soldier so bad, they could have after the raindrop went awry, the paratroopers could have run into a stray African-American soldier, gone on with historically correct racism issues and the movie goes on)
Plus the movie was cliche-ridden from beginning to end; Boyce the good soldier, Rosenfeld the softie, Ford the gruff leader, Tibbet the joker, Chase the slouch, Wafner the Villanious SS officer, and Chloe the ever martyr damsel in distress turned femme fatale.
But the movie redeemed itself; the good story, action scenes and the sound effects. And by the end, I loved it.",Overlord

They had the ideas to make a good unique movie with all the experiments you see for a few minutes but they would rather dog it down with a odd soldier-has-a-heart-of-gold-and-crush plotline instead. At best this is a ""good but not great"" movie.",Overlord
365,michielodb,Could have been so much better,6,7 February 2019,"Let's be honest, when we saw the trailer for this movie, a lot of people were probabaly like: Damn is this the Nazi zombies movie we have all been waiting for?? After seeing the movie today, I can pretty much say that for the most part...it sadly isn't. Does that mean this film was bad? No, but it's not the film that most of us were probably hoping for.The stuff I liked: The opening scene is very intense with some good camerawork and impressive visuals. The effects in the entire movie are very good, the cinematography is good but mostly just basic. The action is for the most part enjoyable fun, and that's what I wanted from this movie: fun, which I got at times. The acting is also good, not exceptional, but it was okay, although I did hope the characters were more interesting.That's where I'm going to start with my problems: the characters are all pretty to very weak. We don't get a single backstory out of any of them, apart from in the beginning, but the only pieces of information we get from these characters all feel very forced and rushed, resulting in me not really caring. There are also some side characters who our main soldiers come across with and they have no impact on the story, in fact they make the job even more difficult for them, so that was dissapointing. Let's face it, we all just wanted to see soldiers vs zombies in a WW2 setting right? We get that...in like the final 15 minutes of the movie. The action is alright, but it was really dissapointing to see how little time was actually spend on the whole zombie plot, because the trailers really made it look like that was the whole movie.In the end I think I'm probably going to forget about this movie in a couple of days, it's nothing special. A movie about WW2 soldiers fighting zombies, but like an actual good budget movie (not those terrible B-movies) should have been great fun, but we hardly get any of that, and that's a shame.I give it a 6.4/10",Overlord

Overlord starts off looking like your average generic WW2 action pic until the mission takes a surprising mission twist. The actors were 10/10. They made this movie what it is and to their credit, pulled off a masterpiece from a very simple story. To give you some idea, my wife who hates WW2 films was sucked into the story unfolding and ended up loving it, right to the end - now that says a lot. Do your self a favour and go watch it.

It starts off well and I was excited but unfortunately it takes an age for anything zombie related to actually happen and when it does it's not as good as it's sold to you in the trailer. It was also ripping off scenes from other films (cheek!!), its extremely pretentious and quite frankly uninspiring. A total let down. Im angry writing this as I had such high hopes and feel the trailer fools you into thinking this going to be something fun and a gore fest... ok the gorey stuff is good but it's let down by how seriously it takes itself.

369,Spookylicious,Frankenstein's Army whatered down.,4,13 February 2019,"Let's be honest. What all of us expected when going in this movie was for nazi mutant experiments vs us army action.That action is just a random prisoner that gets free and chases acting weird to be killed. And the main antagonist we've seen for most of the movie. That's it. The rest of the mutated soldiers are freed at the end just to blow up with the final bomb. They don't even get to do anything besides appear walking for a few seconds.The rest of the movie is just an annoying and useless plot with a random french woman and her lil brother that gets kidnapped by the bad nazy boss to screw the us soldiers and the woman.I expected so much more. But seems like they only had funds for makeup and practical effects for those 2 baddies.Overall, I find it a waste of potential and time for what it promissed.As another user said, this is exactly like Frankenstein's Army, but with less army and more woman and lil brother.",Overlord

Its not something that is setting up its own universe (despite it's previous rumoured links to the cloverfield films) which seem to be a current theme in cinema, nor is it yet another remake.

There's also some very odd decisions by the main characters like why is the Nazi being kept alive? Boyce cant wait to open fire at times yet almost mutinies because said Nazi is being 'interrogated'. Also Boyce finds an easy way in and out but doesn't mention it as soon as he gets back. Eh, why not as it's kind of a big deal given the mission! Overall it was OK but definitely a missed opportunity.",Overlord
380,thabzzl,So much potential,5,28 May 2020,"The first twenty or so minutes are absolutely perfect. Intense, chaotic and violent with characters dying left and right. The scene where the main character falls through the air with planes exploding all around him is probably one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen in a war movie. Then they land and you watch with bated breath as they sneak through enemy territory, triggering mines along the way and losing one of their own while he's in the middle of talking about his hopes and dreams.The movie then falls off a steep cliff. Suddenly the enemy army that shot them out of the sky is incompetent and cartoonishly evil. Suddenly the main character can disobey orders and essentially sabotage the mission and face no repercussions. Mysterious substance you saw the Germans testing on dead villagers? Better inject it into your recently deceased friend. The town you almost died to reach and where you have only been safe because Chloe is hiding you in her attic? You can now walk around freely as if you were the Fuhrer himself.The extreme contrast between the first twenty minutes and the rest of the film is never more stark than when multiple explosive charges going off at once simply causes the main character to fall to the ground for a few seconds before jumping to his feet like nothing happened when earlier in the film a single mine going off had them all rolling around on the ground, deafened by the explosion.The 'zombies' feel like an afterthought and the German commander's ridiculous, cringe-worthy cartoon villain lines toward the end just drag an already terrible final act even further down.This movie could have been something great but it honestly just falls completely flat once the first twenty minutes are over.",Overlord

384,seans_life,Wolftenstein .. enough said!,7,21 July 2019,This movie starts out like some serious action flick but ends up being everything a gamer that played Wolfenstein games would want. There were a few moments where I felt dialogue could have been better or no dialogue used would have been better but it didn't take away the overall fun of this movie. It also like a movie of a similar name with the ending basically commenting on the fact that power / knowledge taken from the enemy and put in the good guys hands isn't the right idea as it seems humanity is bad to the core. Anyway a 100% must see and / or buy for fans of Wolfenstein and a good movie to just chill and watch despite a little message sent at the end. Wish I saw this in theatre and hope some place that plays old movies will have this showing one day and I can get to it. As for the real parts of this they were breathtaking and gruesome and had me saying thankfully I was never put in the position to experience war.

The scale that they portrayed it was going to be is misleading. I expected a grander, more epic feel, but it soon becomes a small claustrophobic piece mostly in two locations. The horror takes its time to appear and then it's only two or three reanimated soldiers......... I was expecting a small army against a platoon of men fighting for their lifes. Instead it was like Wolfenstein (as mentioned many times) but far less action or monsters.
The most inept Nazi soldiers ever. Enemy soldiers are sneaking about everywhere at ease..... seemingly.Watch The Bunker or Outpost for better films instead and don be conned by this disappointment.
Don't get me wrong, it's well shot and acted, some good effects ......... But sadly lacking in any real storyline, character development or scale.

This film delivered exactly what I wanted from it. Aside from a bit of a slow paced and slightly clunky first act Overlord is a blast. Brutal and bloody violence, tense and frightening chase sequences and disturbing horrifying Nazi lab experiments, all of these are here and it's awesome to see. However I didn't expect to become really invested in the characters in the movie and for them to all have interesting development and arcs. The music/cinematography and editing are all excellent and the CGI and practical effects are both used to their strengths in the best situations. Go see and support Overlord, it's a refreshing take on type of film that you really don't see done well anymore with a big budget, good acting and a plot that takes itself seriously while also embracing the fact that it is a schlocky over the top B-Movie 👍🏻",Overlord
401,eeluksw,An Interesting Operation,7,21 November 2018,"Overlord's opening minutes pay small dues to Spielberg-backed WWII epics such as Saving Private Ryan and Band Of Brothers, which I find odd, seeing as the energy and premise of this bloody action horror feel lifted straight out of the world of video games. The first spoken line of dialogue coming from the company sniper is a total paraphrase of a scene from Private Ryan, specifically Private Jackson's declaration that if he had 400 yards of clear sight to Hitler, the war would be over.It's interesting to see this film try to juggle both these influences at the same time, but in the end, it takes way long to get going. It's not as if we want to sit around and listen to these characters talk, they're all very thin, playing some worn-out archetype (including that company sniper, his entire arc is concerned with getting him to like a child). Had the film been more obsessed with the church and what lies beneath, there would have been more opportunities to pit them against the Fourth Reich, which here is only displayed as a curiosity; essentially it's a project in the beta phase.Or, if the film wanted to continue to pay its respects to more historical accounts of the Second World War, the journey to the church could have taken on this Band Of Brothers-esque journey as the soldiers of the 101st fight for every advantage they can get, behind enemy lines, against impossible opposition. They claw and die to reach the church, only to be tested further by a second-to-third act twist that throws everything they've learned out the window.This is all wishful thinking, as we get a movie that's caught in between two wildly different depictions of the Nazi regime, and while what's here is good, it's hard not to drift during the film and wonder what could have been if we didn't spend so much damn time in that girl's house.

411,DirectorSam,Quick Overlord review,6,15 November 2018,"Overlord is the most historically accurate WWII film in the past 2 weeks. So it's not accurate at all. But what it is however, is a gory and bloody action film with over the top set-pieces and all the typical J.J. Abrams tropes such as lens flares in every scene and explosions to rival Michael Bay. But this has decent good characters, charisma, and a sense of fun and adventure. It's not without it flaws, some dialogue just doesn't flow very well, and the cgi at times can be obnoxiously bad. But the practical effects are great. Wouldn't be mad if it got nominated for makeup at the Oscars. Overall, its a fun time.",Overlord

417,simonw70,"Not scary, not exciting, just dumb.",1,18 January 2020,"A horror movie set in Nazi occupied France... the premise had me excited about the possibilities.Unfortunately, the movie suffers from nonsensical casting and a lack of realism or authenticity of any kind. You get absolutely no sense of who these characters are, their backgrounds or their personalities. As far as the WWII aspects of the movie are concerned, it's as far from Band of Brothers as you could possibly get.The horror aspects are really no better. There seem to be no rules or world-building here to create any kind of tension or stakes. There's some limited gore and body horror, but nothing that will shock or scare its audience. The action soon becomes farcical and almost slapstick.All in all, I couldn't help wondering how great a movie with a premise like this could have been with a better director, better cast, better plot and more realistic characters. As it is, it's just a very dumb and poorly made action movie for a teen audience. The protagonists actions make no sense and the antagonists are nothing more than cartoon characters.

423,jrugg19,Going to turn into a Cult Classic,8,9 November 2018,"Overlord is essentially a B-movie with a Hollywood budget, great action, and a TON of gore. I really enjoyed this movie quite a bit, especially in the opening scene, which was shot very well. This movie is an action-horror set during World War II when a bunch of American Soldiers discover that the Germans are up to something sinister in one of their bases, and that is all I will say about the plot. It's awesome to watch. The films cast doesn't consist of any A-Listers or Superstars, but has a lot of recognizable faces such as Wyatt Russell, (who's performance reminded me a lot of his dad Kurt in The Thing), Pilous Asbaek and Jacob Anderson of Game of Thrones fame, John Magaro and Bokeem Woodbine, and newcomers Jovan Adepo and Mathilde Olliver as the leads. To sum it up, Overlord is the type of movie that is going to develop a fanbase years from now, it is very fun and will satisfy those both looking for intense action and gory horror, and I can easily recommend this. We can all thank Julius Avery for directing such a fun movie and J.J Abrhams for deciding to NOT turn this film into a Cloverfield movie.",Overlord

It was all done very well but it seemed like two different movies. I knew what I was getting into. The first part was played so straight and visceral and the last part was pure schlock.

426,philwilson271,A film that's not sure what it wants to be,3,16 October 2020,"Part WW2 action, part zombie horror, but I feel like they did a really bad job trying to mesh the two. The intro sees a group of paratroopers dropped behind enemy lines, and it was a great scene, but also does nothing to set up the horror elements that come later. There was no mystery, no suspense, no scares, just a badass action sequence. If it had been the opening sequence for an action movie, it was perfect, but this isn't just an action movie.The first hints of horror are when the group of soldiers get to the village. Hiding out in a house, they hear an old lady making creepy zombie-like noises. Again, if this was the build up to some genuine horror moments, it would have been effective, but what we get after is more action, with the soldiers planning the next phase of their mission. The old lady is completely forgotten.And taking the two elements separately doesn't give a better viewing experience. As a horror movie, it's light on gore, light on scares, and with 'zombies' that have no consistency in traits, appearance, or behaviour. As an action movie, characters, dialogue, and sequences are all a little bit cliche.A darker tone might have worked better. Or maybe a war film that turns full on horror in the second act. Instead, we get scenes of horror wedged in between action movie moments and the whole thing feels a bit too light-hearted and cartoonish.It just makes everything feel so disjointed. While I'm sure it is possible to meld the two genres, I don't feel like this film manages to do it at all.",Overlord

From the very first scene, I realised we would be subjected to a gross rewrite of history. If you have a historical fiction narrative, it need to hew to actual history enough to be believable.If one is creating a set piece within a wartime conflict, one has a duty to history to make the background and the circumstances real. We were immediately challenged to believe that there were American paratroopers landing at Normandy...with an African American commanding the plane full of paratroopers and another African American as a paratrooper in that unit.To be sure, one million African Americans did service during World War II...in segregated units only and frequently only in logistics and supply functions. This is one primary reason why only 700 to 800 African American military personnel lost their lives during World War II.The film-makers 'reset' history to show a scenario more typical of the Vietnam War, when troops and command functions were quite happily mixed.After ten minutes, I paused the movie, then chequed the poster, which showed Black soldiers, White Soldiers and Female Soldiers all busily engaged in what would prove to be merely another frightfully sanitised, integrated and 'woke' Holly-Weird fiasco.No. No thank you, very very much.",Overlord

Mixed with nasty zombies and supernatural powers, this mixture of comedy and splatter might have had potential, but unfortunately it was only moderately realized. After a promising intro, half of the film is set in the French woman's boring attic. Only towards the end the movie finally picks up speed again but for me personally, this was much too late.By the way, German is a very nice language, which sounds very poetic - if you don't pronounce it as exaggeratedly yelling and hard as the ""Nazis"" usually do in Hollywood movies.

457,lluewhyn,In one word: Mediocre,5,11 November 2018,"If I had to use additional words, ""Underwritten"" and ""Half-Baked"" come to mind. This movie attempts to mash up genres of WW2 action and Sci-Fi Horror, and doesn't do the best job, because the horror part feels somewhat shoe-horned in and at times feels like two different (but mediocre) films. I think the trailer oversells how much horror element is actually in the movie. If somebody told me the film originally started as a straight-up WW2 platoon mission and then studio execs forced 25% of the movie to be re-shot with a horror plot, I'd believe them, as it's that awkwardly mixed together. I don't think horror buffs will be very pleased, especially with how tame a lot of the gore is.Apart from an excellent introduction in the style of Saving Private Ryan, everything about the movie is unremarkable and derivative. The characters are stock archetypes. The acting isn't great, but not really bad. Virtually all of the story beats in the movie will remind you of stuff you've seen in other (better) movies. Heck, the sense of deja vu was so pervasive for me that even some of the lead actors reminded me of other (better) actors:Wyatt Russell reminded me of Jason Clarke, Pilou Asbeck reminded me of Michael Shannon, along with some of the supporting characters. The characters make a whole lot of stupid decisions, but I was too numbed by that point to really care.Not a whole lot of really bad parts of the movie (maybe the goofy, over the top Nazi tropes, and the really slow pacing in the middle of the movie), but not a whole lot good either.",Overlord

There were a few good scenes like the initial plane drop (bad acting, bad humor, but I liked seeing the interior of the plane, everyone dying, rather than most movies where it would just show the plane dropping). It could've been a ""half decent"" WW2 movie. Sure, Nazis did lots of interesting experimental science (the world would be much more advanced if they won) But this is just a dumb horror movie with little logic, it breaks down into a bad zombie(?) movie. There are better Nazi-zombie movies. But in general I'd say they're all bad.

Toward the end there is a scene in which the doctor insists it's not perfected to be used amongst the living to a lead German soilder it then yet creates immortal resident evil style human/monster - William birkin RE2 Then in another scene they inject a solider after his death to save him as he is killed by Birkin before he got his hands on the vial) and he has a similar reaction but mutates like Mr X / The Tyrant and cannot control himself whereas Birkin could????Amongst it all no other ""zombies"" really appeared however something did appear briefly and he looked like burnt mutant that couldn't talk just screeched and ran after anything it desired which was the only thing close to zombies that related in the film. I'm not sure if it was intentional they didn't commit to a zombie outcome if anything it gives off a resident evil and nazi zombies vibe slightly disappointing but it wasn't a bad film I did enjoy it I just think zombies would of been better than a main boss and battle (that's what the rereleases or Resident Evil games are for.)I do think this film will have a sequel I just hope it's not a rubbish one.

When it comes to the ""horror"" aspect to it, it's well documented that the Nazi did do some horrifying experiments on humans.

When, after 70 minutes, the ""horror"" aspect finally kicks in, the film's basically already over.In a nutshell, this is a bad war flick, with three of four accidental zombie-like creatures.

Two underrated actors with potential to be big stars, but maybe good actors don't really focus on becoming ""movie stars"" any more and aspire more to getting consistent spots in streaming series.

First of all I have to say that Overlord was NOT at all the movie I expected, this after only watching the initial trailer once and nothing more. I honestly expected more of an action/horror comedy than this, but I was not disappointed!
The movie is about a team tasked with a demolition job in order to secure the Normandy landing, a.k.a. Operation Overlord.
Something is lurking underneath the old church in the village though and the mission turns out to be a bit bigger than planned, what you have to find out for yourself...
I was surprised to see such a big budget for a movie in this genre and whoever was in charge of props, costume and location did such an amazing job because everything was period correct - everything!
If you like horror flicks and don't mind a few graphical scenes with blood and gore then this is the one for you.
I actually prefer that it was a non comedy in the end and since these kind of movies are so rarely made, and never with this kind of budget and detail, I simply had to give it a 9/10 score!

Regardless, it was suspenseful almost constantly and the cg was awesomely realistic. Had just the right amount of action, suspense, and jump out scares.

Story is just unoriginal, and old. The nazis are making unethical, experiments to make super soldiers. If you saw at least one movie of each category, you can guess what will happen all the way to the end, along with who will die, and who will survive. The characters are predictable,boring,irritating, and not interesting whatsoever. Also, if I remember correctly, it is never explained, or touched upon how the nazis are able to make serums that are able to bring back the dead. We dont know if it is possible because the village had some kind of old secret, like a strange meteor that landed in the village hundreds of years ago which the nazis then found and exploited, or because the nazis made some kind of scientific break through.

The protagonist is flawless and boring as hell. He doesn't want to kill any form of life, constantly jeopardises the mission for childish reasons, insubordinates but doesn't get any crap for it and walks through the movie relatively unscaved. Meanwhile the Germans are comically evil and incompetent and pose no real threat to our heroes. They miss all the time while our heroes mow them down way too easy with basically just 2 people against 40 or so Germans. Full of cliches jump scares, an annoying child that runs into the line of fire trope and some of the worst designed zombies I've ever seen.

The sound alone is a thing of paranoid-beauty!I also want to address the negative reviews which call out the main character's race...I think movies should be historically accurate when the story warrants, but this movie is not about ""accurate history."" This is an ENTERTAINMENT piece (obviously), and the character's race does not change any aspect of this film, nor does it play into the story.So back to this Billy Ray madness! I was thoroughly entertained during this film.The characters aren't deeply fleshed out, but they all show a form of growth. The horror and suspense are not extensive, but when it arrives, it is gripping and quite gory.This movie will not redefine the genre, and it is not a perfect merger of horror/war.It is, however, a thoroughly entertaining mash-up of ideas rarely seen together. The acting is quite good. The visuals are engaging, with some classic body horror, and one of the most EPIC opening sequences of the last year.I would highly recommended this movie for anyone who saw the trailer and was intrigued.

However, as much as I really liked this film, the fact that the picture didn't come close to filling the screen. I went up to the screen as it ended and stretched my arms out and discovered it was leaving over 5 feet of empty screen on either side of the film and 2 feet on both the top and bottom. They claimed it was meant to be seen that way and they couldn't fix it. I am sure JJ Abrams would disagree. This was a really good looking film outside of the fact the picture was so small. I really liked the fact that they showed the US military as integrated so that we could have a black soldier as a main character in a WW 2 movie.

Then it's a mix of every horror movie you have ever seen with scenes clearly pulled directly from them, But done without the finesse and style that great horror has, even the "" gory "" stuff is not that great. You're not going to see any Rob Bottin style effects here as they are weak. You're left at the end thinking this has been far too long and bad things have happened to characters I do not care for and actually just wanted them all to be eaten.

529,alinda-thelostgirl,Thoroughly enjoyable zombie-war film mashup,8,14 November 2018,"Despite not containing real spoilers, I'm filtering this review because I make a commentary of all three acts and I feel that even knowing how I felt during the development of the third act might spoil the fun for someone else.First off, I went to the cinema expecting to enjoy this film. Nazi experiments and monster movies are a combo that promise to be entertaining, though not all films then deliver such promises.Now, the film mashes up the war film genre with the action-horror one, so if you're expecting historical accuracy, don't even bother. Bear in mind that the real historical events are here being used as plot devices, and that this is clearly meant to be low brow entertainment, and not a depiction or criticism of the horrors of war.The cast is brilliant, managing to pull off any bits of inevitably cliched script-writing this sort of project is bound to have. What particularly impressed me though, were the action scenes, from the fast-paced, savage beginning when the soldiers are reading to jump into Nazi-occupied French territory, to the fights between the heroes and the villains in the film's third act.The plot is never stale, though not original either. Most of the story's development can be easily predicted, but it's well shot and well acted so it still manages to keep the viewer engaged. By setting this horror flick in the midst of the war, the film doesn't suffer from excessively slow build up syndrome, by which I mean when monster films don't want to reveal their monster immediately and so tend to pace the build up too slowly. There are so many other things happening that while you are aware you are being kept from the promised monsters in order to build anticipation, you don't have the time to resent the film for it or be bored.My only criticism is with the third act. Once we get to the actual showdown, the film becomes a little bit weak, or perhaps the correct word would be ""abrupt"": after all that build up, it all gets done and over so quickly that you feel a little bit robbed of the satisfaction that you know should accompany the closing of the action.

530,imno007-2,10 Stars When Grading on a Curve,10,20 September 2019,"If I were being completely objective, I'd probably give this 8 stars, but in this case I feel inclined to give it 10 to counter-balance what I think are a lot of unfairly negative reviews. I'm not going to turn this into a book, but suffice to say the movie has a good cast, all very competent actors, great production values - definitely watch in high definition if you can! - and is equally good as a war movie as it is a horror movie. And let's be real here, people: when it comes to horror movies, you kind of have to grade on a curve: as horror movies goes, this IS at minimum a four-star movie. If you're a diehard horror fan, you know exactly what I mean. If you're not, then maybe you won't like it as much - and what I think of as some of the unnecessarily harsh reviews are probably from people who don't watch a lot of horror, but watched this one because they saw J. J. Abrams name attached to it, or something.",Overlord

Everything from somewhat serious stuff such as World War Z and The Walking Dead, to the funny, cheesy, campy ones like Warm Bodies, Shaun of the Dead, and Planet Terror. Plus, I love the Castle Wolfenstein game franchise.Overlord is one confused mess. It's almost like they convinced Spielberg to make a Saving Private Ryan prequel, then ran out of budget after the first 30 minutes and for the rest of the movie, decided to randomly pick things from Wolfenstein and every other zombie/horror movie.Even that could have been done in an entertaining way, but I guess everyone had already given up by then. Just throw in lots of jump scares, indestructible monsters, deus ex machina, pure good vs pure evil; every movie cliche in the book, and hope some of it sticks.Why waste money on good writing, character development, and talent, when you can blow it all on special effects, marketing, and favorable reviews?",Overlord

540,jonnyboy-78133,Reviewing some of the viewers.,7,6 February 2019,"This was a reasonably entertaining movie. It was perhaps a bit too straightforward for my taste but normally as soon as there's mention of zombies I'm out. Is anybody really terrified of something as unrealistic as zombies? Anyway, it seems some reviewers feel this wasn't nearly hardcore enough. Or that the reviews they'd read before seeing it led them to believe it would be more shocking. I guess this would be to the reviewers who thought this was hardcore and therefore duped some people. I think it's important to remember that the people who are going to see a movie because it was described as shocking, extremely disturbing, made me sick etc are often the same people who have seen every revolting, traumatizing clip om BestGore or YouTube or wherever they have twisted video's who have completely desensitized themselves through years of trauma. Yes, unless your a sadistic sociopath or psychopath the desensitizing is the minds way of protecting itself from more trauma and your lucky because that's a whole lot better than the other options. Truth be told if your a grindhouse and expendables fan you like crazy violence and action and are very unlikely to be shocked anymore by a mainstream movie. It's unfortunate most of the people like this aren't aware of how badly they've been traumatized and are still chasing that buzz. If they were to ask themselves the last time they were shocked or whatever it was probably the nail in the coffin so to speak, the one that sent the mind over the edge into protection mode. The faces on some of the creatures if you will was pretty horrifying. If i'd seen that when I was a kid it wouldn't have been good.

There's a scene at the beginning of the movie where our heroes are moving to their rally point behind enemy lines and you would think they were on a afternoon Sunday hike.

Gory bits were decent and quite fun at times.Why hire a Danish actor to play a German bad guy (even though Pilou can actually act)? Ze Germans must be cringing with every word spoken in his heavy accent.Jovan reminded me of John Boyega in Force Awakens - with that confounded look on his face in almost every scene. J.J.

I will confess to not being a great fan of the war genre and more leaning to the horror element the trailer suggested was contained.
The opening sequences of the soldiers on the plane is absolutely awesome, the effects the acting were top draw and had me thinking maybe I should give war films a little more of my time. Its a dark film with a very clever plot and all the actors play their role brilliantly and are very believable. As I have said the war scenes are spectacular to look at and the horror scenes are not so over the top as to ruin the hard work that has come before it. In a very weird way the factors leading up to the horror scenes are believable and you can imagine that just maybe somewhere in a dark forest these things could actually be happening.
Its a great film that doesn't take itself too seriously and is exactly what the trailer suggests, an action packed visual delight that deserves to be seen.
My only concern is that it doesn't get ignored due it being released around the same time as Halloween and Bohemian Rhapsody as it truly deserves a platform of its own.

This isn't the type of movie that would typically catch my attention but as it starred one of my favourite actors (Iain de Caestecker - whose transformation scene was spectacular) I decided to give this movie a chance, despite my initial reluctance and squeamishness I was thoroughly enraptured by this movie.The entire cast did wonderful, you could feel the pain of Wyatt Russel's character as he hung on that hook - I won't go into detail as it's quite sickening - as well as Iain de Caestecker's head snapping transformation, which will certainly send chills down your spine.All the characters were likeable and it was very refreshing to see an empowering woman featured who wasn't treated by the good guys as 'eye candy', not one of the main cast referred to her in a demeaning manner ('pretty lady') and the camera never lingered on her body in a way to create male gaze. However, the films villain did have a twisted connection to Chloe which only served to show how chilling he truly was. I also appreciate the fact that this movie didn't include crappy sexual jokes which cheapen movies in a poor attempt of satire or display of masculinity.Overall, the movie did not disappoint and surpassed my initial beliefs. However, I wasn't quite expecting a 'happy ending' of sorts for the remaining cast. It was a pleasant surprise, though I was anticipating the town to be bombed in those final moments.",Overlord

But in a second thought, i couldn't think of better way to start the movie.
One thing that was very apparent to me is that the movie, especially the beginning of it can really make you feel how horrible war is.

Not sure why trained troopers would act like easy going guys on a walk in a neighbourhood right after emergency landing in enemy's land. Not realistic but ok let it slide, this is a Nazi zombie horror movie with flamethrowers, blood-flowing and heads-rolling, I wish it was. Speaking of credibility of all what is happening I wonder how one could run with his back facing the attackers firing and not be shot by the strongest soldiers at that time, director, seriously try playing COD at least - not gonna happen. All shotouts look like COD on the rookie mode. The first scene of the movie looked more, if not the most realistic.The first zombie btw only appears after a good half of the movie that should have been at least one-third shorter leaving behind pointless chatter and letting zombies free earlier.The looks of zombies are a bad taste not adding more scares, should of added more originality for a new nazisplotation flick. What makes it worse is abandunce of cliches like everywherw, again making ALL actions predictable. Watching the film you usually feel like having a sequence of deja vus.Protogonists are different and likable. Main hero is good even though a pacifist is a doubtful choice for action-driven movie.To sum up we have a good interesting trailer but boring movie full of cliches, not a good horror nor action, expected more, hard to single out a couple of positive things.

To be fair, you don't see much of the 'zombies' but what you see, is great. The movie isn't scary at all, nor gory or anything you would expect of a horror movie but it had a lot of potential te be one. Maybe they kept it that way to attract a broader audience.If the intention was a just a WOII movie with a twist...alright i can live with that, it was entertaining. If you expect to see a horror, you will be let down.",Overlord

The first 10 minutes of action/drama is right up there with some of the best in movie history.It's too short. So much potential left on the table I wish it had been a mini series instead of a movie. The Overlord universe is rich with story and horror to explore.",Overlord
592,John-Derat,(7.5/10) Good movie which is definitely worth watching!,7,8 October 2021,"Honestly, what can I say about Overlord? Do you like horror? Action? WWII? All combined? Then this is for you! (Careful though, there's a lot of gore which might be too much if you're not used to it. Not too much gore though, NOT the kind of movie that throws gore around for the fun of it.)When the movie starts, you'll get hooked. You're plunged right into the action (almost) straight away. In only the first 10 or 15 minutes of the movie, you will see one of the best paratrooping scenes ever. I was personally on the edge of my seat the entire duration of those first 10 minutes, until it quieted down a bit to let the audience breath from all that action and suspense.The scenario itself is good, a small squadron is sent to take down a communications center which is located in the church of a French village, but obviously, things don't go too well and almost all the planes are taken down by the German Anti-Air batteries, from that point on, they need to regroup when they land and formulate an attack. The way the story progresses is quite good and nothing really stood out to me.The gunfights are GREAT! There was nothing better than seeing Germans shoot their STG's, MG42's, MP40's, etc. And the Americans use their trusty M1 Garand and Thomson. Not only the sounds are great, but the actual ""choreography"" is very good as well. And also, the characters don't have too much plot-armor! Still a bit of course, but not too much in my opinion.The horror was well done, there was a massive jumpscare which was kind of predictable, but it was still a good jumpscare, and there's a couple more small ones, but nothing worth mentioning. The actual stuff inside the lab beneath the church though, is very scary and maybe even blood-curling, a lot of body horror there. Also, one scene is very gory, so you might reconsider watching this movie if you have trouble handling that kinda stuff.Now, for the characters. They're all good, nothing unique or ""really good"", just all good characters, some a bit cliché, like your typical bad German guy and the American, strong, serious leader. There's also the comedic relief character that you might get attached to. Anyway, they get a small bit of development, but not much because this is still only a movie. But yeah, good characters, and there's a good chance you won't dislike any.The actors were good as well, you might recognize the Colonel if you've watched Black Mirror, and also a couple others. Anyway, some didn't give an outstanding performance, but they were certainly convincing enough!They also tried going for the least amount of CG possible in this movie, and going for practical. Which is why it gets so shocking at times.Overall, a good movie which is really worth watching. Definitely entertained me, and also, if you're a Call of Duty Zombies fan, you will certainly want to check this movie out, since it's probably the closest we'll get to Nazi Zombies!",Overlord

The characters are as one dimensional as would be expected in a pre school kids show. The storyline has more holes than a pepper pot. It's definitely not a horror film and it's a poor action film too. Any Stallone van dam or Arnold Schwarzenegger movie has ten times the depth this bag of garbage this has, the effects are a miss mash Great War action bits crossed with bad cgi I am legend rip off nazi things. The mass majority of the film is lifted directly from captain America the first avenger. Basically nazis are doing experiments on dead and living solders although it contradicts itself as the plot gos on by injecting them with tar no explanation of why. This creates a super solder. The bad nazi officer takes super syrup first then a plucky America corporal has to in order for him to fight the red skull opps I mean nazi rapist. It's so blatant I think marvel should sue for copyright. Even with all the fighting explosions and general action it's boring so badly so several people actually got up and left during the final third of the film. Badly written badly directed badly acted but it's not the actors faults hardly given much scope with this writing. Big budget effects on a bad bad B movie who's basic plot is injecting engine oil into nazis makes them react completely randomly some turn into 28 days later type things some turn into universal solders completely randomness.",Overlord

Just mind numbing stupidity..A great premise for a horror film is wasted. Horrible unrealistic casting. A black sergeant leading a mixed race 101st parachute regiment in WW2 didn't exist. The scrip is unrelentingly ignorant. They obviously had a good budget for this so it's hard to understand. It almost seems deliberate. It's a ripoff of Frankenstein""'s Army, as an earlier reviewer already said. That film didn't have the budget but it is far superior to this over hyped trash. It had some nightmarish scenes.

On one side it's really serious movie of a squad of soldiers behind enemy lines, trying to complete their mission, the other a splatter-fest zombie shoot-em-up. If you go into thinking the latter you might have a good time. However that's easily forgotten with the serious tone the movie has throughout 2/3rds of it. It's not a bad movie by any means. The characters are charactertures of other war movies you might've seen. If it were less serious and more tongue in cheek it would probably get away with being a fantastic zombie film.

So how was it?
It was really good. I didn't think it was great, but it has some really cool stuff that was very entertaining, and overall I had a good time. The first thing I'll get into would be the VFX, which I believe were created by ILM. The gore effects were incredible and made me squirm in delight, and the opening sequence of the squads plane getting shot down over France was spectacular. It looks absolutely stunning and is equally terrifying, especially with the excellent sound design.
The cast for the most part was good, I wouldn't say anyone was outstanding but they were really good. One comedic character in particular worked very well, and the dynamic between the leads was fun and interesting, but it never goes too deep. But let's face it, I didn't go to the movie for deep characters, I went for the WWII Nazi zombies.
I was a little let down to be honest with the amount of zombie material in the movie. Maybe that's a little nit picky but a lot of the best zombie stuff was shown in the trailer, and although it's more fleshed out in the final film, it would've been nice to have seen some other crazy stuff that we hadn't already seen bits of. Then again, the zombie sequences and effects that are in the movie are fantastic, both creepy and undeniably fun. I guess I just would've liked a little more.
I guess I'll end this by saying if you want a fun WWII/zombie movie, go see this. We need more R-rated blockbusters like this, so go support this one.",Overlord

a Video Rental store clerk and I've seen my fair share or movies, but not many war films succeed in presenting war with such a gritty view as Overlord, which amazes me, because too many films attempt to glorify it or add a patriotic spin. Instead the film presents the attrocities of war, particularly caused by the Nazis, but also glimpsed is the degrading actions of the Americans. Character development is kept sharp and simple and with the men thrown against extreme odds, their relationships with one another quickly become apparent. If you're a fan of gore horror and jump scares, this movie will certainly satisfy you, with the likes of myself (a huge Saw fan) feeling distressed at moments, but that's part of the fun.

643,Jarrett_Harrison_210,This movie overall is OK. That's it.,5,20 December 2018,"This movie is a ""meh"" out of ten. If you were expecting a horror movie, do not watch this movie. The only horror elements in here are some fake jump scares and some admittedly awesome special effects, but not nearly enough to even make this come close to a horror flick.The characters were very one dimensional. The main character is Johnny goody, the corporal is the serious one, the dude with the new York accent is the comic relief, the woman character is a strong independent woman, the nazi is an evil monster, etc, etc. Due to them feeling more like characters than people, I found it hard to get invested with any of them, and the absence or death of any of them left very little impact on me. I can hardly even remember the names of any of the characters, and I had just left from the theatre 20 minutes ago.The action scenes consisted mainly of jump cuts, the lazy way to create tension in action movies nowadays. Not to mention it seems like injuries don't have much impact to anyone in this world. Just ask the big nosed soldier who had a needle taken out of him, and was completely good to fight in the next scene.However, there is a little bit of goodness to be taken from this movie. The cinematography in many of the shots is honestly on par with other big name war movies, and the special effects were the one thing I honestly really loved about the whole film. The action scenes weren't complex, but they were loud and gory enough to distract the general audience from the numerous jump cuts.If you're looking for a genuinely great movie experience, do not come to this movie.

I thought the movie started out strong and really made you feel like you were in the war with them. Throughout the movie, I especially liked how they slowly had the two main characters start to like each other which made us root for them even more, but they never quite gave us what we wanted either. The only part I felt that bugged me about this movie was the end of it when the two other main characters started fighting like it was supposed to be a Marvel movie or something. I felt like they could have had him just blow up the compound instead of dragging out the fight scene as they did",Overlord
647,bobstevehd,Overlord overdone,7,12 March 2019,"Overlord is an overall good movie. As a whole it does the job of delivering a gripping thriller, surprisingly easy to follow plot, solid acting, and consistent pacing. Although the movie hits most of the key points it does lack however in the smaller more minute details. The script was lacking the fine tuning and smoothness that i'd expect from a big budget film like this. I found my self asking questions that the movie should be answering. Not of the plot, but of the execution of the plot. It was noticeable that some decisions were only made because of its cinematic showmanship rather than logic. It's minor, but distracting. Without spoiling, characters made some decisions that seemed unreasonable. On the bright side I was delighted by the campy, almost Tarantino-esque, violence. It totally fit in with the feel of the movie and made a (potentially boring) cookie cutter zombie movie entertaining.",Overlord
648,docshows-95319,Too historically inaccurate.,2,14 March 2019,This movie was hard to watch. It was so full of historical inaccuracies and anachronism that I couldn't concentrate on it.

651,tedbreen,Fun war movie with a horror twist,7,12 November 2018,"Fun war movie with a horror twist. On its face, it is a procedural military mission - get in and do the thing to support the impending Allied invasion. The horror twist comes when the soldiers discover some strange stuff happening in the village. Medical experiments are being performed to transform normal humans into super soldiers. The mission now becomes twofold: destroy the tower and destroy the lab! Nothing particularly special or innovative about the story, but it was wildly entertaining and enjoyable. Very exciting edge-of-your-seat action scenes, well-performed roles, top-notch special effects, and solid jump scares. We watched it in the Dolby theater at AMC Metreon in SF.

662,macduwell,Private Snowflake,3,26 June 2021,"Movie was quite annoying: characters and actions are written badly. Do not watch it, you'll forget it anyway.About characters:
Mr. Boyce, our main hero, is so special, that he could not even kill a mouse. Despite that he was sent to ww2, where he continues to try to save everyone, even when it is straightforward stupid and suicidal. Not a relatable protagonist for me.Ford was fine - the only reasonable man in the movie. Not too much of a character though, just an ordinary seasoned tough guy.Chloe, supposedly, was taking care for a zombie aunt for some time. Why zombie-aunt did not attack her? How Chloe was taking care of her? What Chloe was thinking about that? Could've been an interesting character, but ended up to be just a cute girl with annoying little brother.Actions:
Overall most of the actions are annoying and/or formulaic.Private Snowflake sees his comrade superior surrounded and wants to rescue him by rushing on a dozen of nazis. But he is stopped by a tough guy.Private Photographer is sent to bring down nazi-chief, supposedly heavily beaten with a knuckles. Nazi-chief tricks him faking unconcious, then disarms and kills him.Private Sniper tries to save an annoying kid and is shot on the way back.And so on. Most of this scenes do not develope characters, because they are too formulaic to be taken seriously, they do not forward plot eigher. Just waste time. Btw speaking of unnececary formulaic scenes. Private Photographer is ressurected by a zombie-serum, then he goes mad and attacks his comrades. Why? This scene kind of contradicts to how serum works in other scenes. Nazi-chief seems to act willingly after injection, Ford too.",Overlord

665,burcak-baskan,"Shallow, cheap filmmaking meets Wolvenstein",3,12 November 2018,"Extremely shallow in every way. Logic of the story fails in the very basics, tries to soup it up with very loud noises, explosions, shaky cam, close up shots on shocked faces, goes into horror mode and opts to scare you with cheap tricks. You also get all the politically correct narrative: All Germans are Nazis, all of them are totally evil and should be shot on sight, evil white men do evil things and the pure, baby faced black guy does all the right things oh and the girl kicks ass. Really? This is the best you came up with in 2018? Sorry I don't have any tolerance for film scripts that choose to pick parts off a scenario lego set and call it art.
The supporting cast do as good a job as they can given the abysmal script but the main character fails and not just because of the bad script.
Visually it's not entertaining, even on the wide screen of a movie theater i felt like i was watching a cheap computer game animation on my computer screen. Fitting I guess as the story is pretty much Wolvenstein 3D of ancient days. Except the hero mainly runs away instead of gunning everything down.",Overlord
666,pcahill333,Entertainment/thriller horror done right,9,12 November 2018,I think some viewers are going to be caught in between on this one. They mix genres but never really fully develop either side (war/horror). Is it entertaining? Absolutely. Jumpy? Yes. Scary. No. Intense? Absolutely. This is bad robots first jump into R rating so it is what you would expect. Kind of reminds me of wolverine. Has enough blood and gore for most and certainly wont offend or mentally scar anyone. Its just a fun movie. Period. If this was a 10 min movie and only opening war sequence existed it would still be worth going to see. Everyone will like this movie as long as they dont go in with serious war or classic horror/zombie expectations,Overlord

The writing and the story wasn't that good it was average at best, The movie was predictable and it had too many clichés. The acting in the move was average it wasn't that good imo. I liked how the movie was very intense from the beginning it wasn't slow paced which made the movie not boring to watch, also the action scenes were entertaining to watch. I didn't like how the movie had alot of gore in it, im okay with gore/bloody scenes i like them sometimes but this one was a little over the top imo.

668,kellvallon,Disappointing at best.,3,14 November 2018,I was very excited for this movie when I saw the previews for it. Unfortunately the advertising was much better than the actual film. If your looking for a good ww2 nazi horror film this is not it. Go play one of the Castle Wolfenstein games instead. Atleast they had better characters and story. With this you dont get any character development. The characters are not likeable and the story is vague. My recommendation is wait till it's on Netflix. This movie is not worth the price of admission.,Overlord

I know it's about zombies but at least make other aspects less about fantasy. First off, there were no African Americans in the 101st in WWII. Second, there were definitely no sergeants in charge of white NCO's. Annoying.
Secondly, the story is s**t. They're supposed to knock out a radio tower but it turns into a sh** show. J.J. Abrams films at it's finest...what a waste of money. Don't spend anymore than a few dollars to rent this because honestly it's not worth it. It sucks.
I don't know why everyone is so emotional in this movie. They're either emotional or showing a love interest. Holy crap, just blow the tower up, kill a few zombies and go home. Meh

Sure, there isn't much of a story and the characters are all pretty cliche, but that didn't really bother me. The movie doesn't do anything new, but in my opinion it doesn't have to. It's well executed and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you're looking for a fun B-Movie to fill your evening, Overlord is a good pick.P.S.

The director, VFX, practical FX and prop/costume designers really need recognition here, so much effort was put into making the film look great. The moments of horror were brought on screen in full gory glory by a very talented team of people. It's been a while since a film has made my jaw drop with effects alone but the body horror here is a sight to behold.The R rating really helped portray the horror, and the straight brutality of war in the opening sequence. The CGI and sound design for the opening air battle were amazing.The plot is pretty straight forward, but forgivable in a film like this because it's so damn fun. Characters are actually fleshed out, the kid wasn't the typical irritating child character and had some sweet moments.

The mutations in Frankenstein's Army were combinations of the dead soldiers and pieces of Hitlers most deadly weapons of war. Panzer, Stuka, etc, etc. Both films left me most satisfied I will say.

Read the summarized synopsis after purchasing tix online & thought that it could go either way. Next I was surprised to read that it was Produced by JJ Abrams & his Bad Robot Production Co., & was their first produced film in the R-Rated category...Glad I caught this info cause it kept me from possibly dosing off during the film & I was able to watch/experience a film that was more than I thought it would be.

The plot was easy to follow not everyone dies (for once). And you have wimps, heros, good guys a kid, a chick they are all shown, granted historical representation I don't think is quite accurate. But I didn't care. There is one character that I actually did like Rosenfeld, he is at the begining, disappears then reappears about 1/3 of they way through the movie. I figured in typical Hollywood fashion he would have been affected and change, he didn't and becam.an asset to the team. Something refreshing for this genre.

738,comicgeek42799,Great visual style but an ending that's a little underwhelming,8,28 November 2018,"From the opening logo I knew I was going to like this film and this belief was solidified after the very first scene. The drop zone sequence kept me on the edge of my seat, with the great visual style and the fantastic sound mixing. This feeling continued until close to the end, which felt like it had finally caught up to the small budget of film. The ending had a lot of the characters just getting thrown around and the set of the church felt very small. So compared to the beginning, the ending was very underwhelming but a part of me was still satisfied with the beats of it.Jovan Adepo, who played the main character Boyce, did a pretty good job and I cared about his character. Wyatt Russell, who played Ford, played the cold-hearted soldier well but when it came to the end, where he had to put more emotion into his lines, is when his acting felt phoned in. I enjoyed John Magaro's Tibbet and his funny moments with the French boy. Pilou Asbæk's villainous Wanfer was like any other Nazi bad guy but his face prosthetics/cgi added more fright to the character.Overall, I believe the film was well made with a full visual grasp of what the director, Julius Avery, wanted to do. This execution was far better than the disappointing Cloverfield Paradox, another Bad Robot film. I wish this was in the Cloverfield universe instead of Cloverfield Paradox but I still feel like this stands pretty well by itself.",Overlord

Some people have talked about a lack of character development...and I think that's wrong actually. I would also remind them that this film takes place within a timeframe of a few hours...not a few days, months or years.

That's it!!! Lol!!
Some of the critics are pretty out of touch with newer films...and even though they may have good taste in specific genres, they just don't get this. So, to those who made this film, kudos to you! It's an excellent work from people who know just what they are doing. It's a taught, never ending craze of edge of your seat moments and crazy fantasy horror.Side note - I think at this moment in time we are starting to mythologize the Nazis as pure evil forms.

782,edinibranovic,An Expertly Executed War Movie With A Unique Approach,10,19 November 2018,"Don't let the marketing fool you. This movie is, for the most part, a slow burn which takes a reasonable amount of time setting up its characters. From witty one-liners that will make any 80's action film enthusiast burst with joy to simplistic, yet cleverly fleshed out relationships, it becomes clear early on that we are supposed to care about these people.
For those eager to get to the exhilirating action sequences and gory deaths, there is much to look forward to. It grabs your attention in the opening scene with a terrifying and visually striking scene taking place in an American warplane. After a spectacular one-take shot and a follow-up long-take, the movie grounds itself and slowly keeps going at a proper pace whilst building up tension for what's to come.
New characters are quickly introduced in a way that both realistically sets up their relationships and subtly teaches us more about them. This is achieved with the help of plot devices such as a camera, a baseball etc. and through many emotionally-driven character actions and conflicts. The cast themselves did an amazing job in their portrayals and really helped with the immersion.
The tension buildup more than pays off with a stomach-turning transformation and the ensuing chaos as everything comes to a climactic conclusion. We already care about the characters, so the movie can focus on exhilirating action made even better by the wonderfully vibrant cinematography and humorous dialogue. Thankfully, director Jules Avery strikes a perfect balance between all the elements of self-aware humour, nasty gore (though quite contained in some scenes) and emotionally satisfying character arcs.
The movie's music is also notable and offers a clever combination of tense and creepy tracks with modern ones (Nas, out of all things) that fits the tone perfectly.
Special effects are insanely good due to the studio's will to shell out a lot of money for a risky project due to J. J. Abrams' interest in it. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it's going to pay off as the movie failed to bring in much of an audience apart from the niche one it was targeting.
After many disappointing releases in 2018 (and that's putting it mildly...), it is quite refreshing to have a highly anticipated title live up to the expectations.
Overlord is, quite simply, an amazing movie deserving of much more attention than it's getting. However, just knowing that Hollywood is still willing to take risks with original movies that don't try to cater to everyone for financial purposes makes me immensely happy and leaves me looking forward to whatever the future of cinema brings.",Overlord

784,suprunatural,An empty feeling as I left the theater,7,10 November 2018,"Firstly, Overlord is not a bad movie but I felt like so much more could have been put into it. From the sky to the end I felt it was missing something. Maybe I expected something more epic because of the backdrop of Operation Overlord, what I imagined when I saw the trailer was something like a combination of A Bridge Too Far and Where Eagles Dare but with the undead. When ln the credits rolled I felt it had fallen just short of my expectations even though I did enjoy certain parts of the film.",Overlord
785,youngbloods-89716,A solid horror flic for fans of gore,8,19 February 2020,"I very much enjoyed this film. I do not enjoy horror films at all, yet Overlord had me hooked from start to finish.
Overlord is a blend of zombie horror and war film, and in my opinion, ticks both boxes well. The battle scenes were shot well and were accurate except for one or two artistic liberties that came off well. The zombies had menace, and were deliciously scary, with incredible effects and gore that was very enjoyable.
I would also like to spare a moment to praise the visual effects used in Overlord. The zombies looked incredible, and during the second half of the film, the effects used on the main antagonist looked absolutely spectacular. If nothing else, Overlord deserves praise for its stellar body horror.As for the characters, I believe that they were played very well to the most part, and I look foreword to seeing the actors in future films. Each character was interesting and well written, and by the end of the film I was yelling encouragement at the onscreen protagonists, something I almost never do. The plot while a little contrived, was projected well, and had a satisfying arc that I felt wrapped up well without any annoying ""but not everything was all that it seemed"" tropes that modern directors have exploited until it is an unbearable status quo. I want my zombie/war films to have a decisive ending where the zombies are all killed, and the hero gets out alive. Overlord gave that to me, and it added at least two stars to the review.I will probably re-watch Overlord, and would recommend this film if you are a fan of body horror, zombie films, or action/WWll films, and if you are into a mixture of all of the above, Overlord is a must-see.",Overlord
786,jaybryant-75484,The transformation scene,9,25 October 2018,"I like the way he's transformed right after he was injected with the stuff, the scene was gruesome and colorful in character. I loved it",Overlord
787,leonorabalazs,Inaccurate rating,1,10 November 2018,"This was not a war movie, it was a horror movie of the poorest calibre. 3 of us in my group walked out about half way through because we found it to be ridiculous.",Overlord
788,bhinton-78969,A couple good jump scares and great action,8,11 November 2018,"I can in to this viewing expecting a fun butquick money grab full of World War Two actions, but to my suprise it was much more. The team that made this movie did incredible work with the special effects from the explosions to distorted bodies of the super soldiers/zombies. Along with that the sounds work was outstanding and keeps you on your toes at all time, for example the noises from some of the death scenes or the feeling of the explosions.",Overlord
789,yanti-86112,Totally amazing!,10,13 November 2018,"Good movie which is give us the real picture what NAZI did as a barbarians people. Unfortunately there is some censored in the middle of movies which is a best part of this movie as a thriller movie.
Over all it is a good movie and worth to watch but not good for kids by the way. It's pump your adrenaline along the movie scene.",Overlord

791,chrissymccoy-97591,Non-stop fun.,9,13 November 2018,"Really exciting. The sound effects were the best. Why no ejected brass from most of the weapons? If the muzzle flashes were CGI, it's the best so far.",Overlord
792,tommygun-71289,"So smart, made me feel in the movie",10,15 November 2018,"Defenitely could make the best war movie of all time, the first scenes were unreal blew me away, i liked the twist in the movie, very happy i seen it, just WILD",Overlord
793,usanicu,Possible Cult Classic in The Making,7,16 November 2018,"I enjoyed this movie immensely without a lot of thinking, Just sit back and enjoy the action: a cross between nazi evil doers, evil scientist, and Indiana Jones -- a fresh face -- black actor is the lead, and that's new for WWII movies, which adds a different texture to these genres.Grab some popcorn and/or sneak in some food - and enjoy the flick.",Overlord
794,deadbuilt,"One word ""MEH""",3,16 November 2018,"Soooo, where do I begin...I expected so much more out of this film. Unfortunately mere minutes in, I was already rolling my eyes. At the end of the day, this is World War 2 movie, so why not begin with every war movie cliche in the first 5 minutes. Don't forget to add a big dash of political correctness.
Let's talk about the characters, shall we? There was little to no character development other than the fact that Boyce is a softy, Ford is a hard ass, and Tibbet is that sniper who thinks he's going to kill Hitler...I remember my first time seeing Saving Private Ryan. I'm just not really sure why this film couldn't have been awesome. The thousand year Reich concept has really never been played with by Hollywood, and due to its layer of truth, it could be such an intriguing basis for a plot. However, for some reason this attempt felt like an over budget Netflix movie. The direction was all over the place, which became even more perplexing considering the story development was weak at best. The writing, cinematography, and editing all felt very rushed, with little to no pace for the audience. THIS FILM WAS NOT DARK ENOUGH!!! We're talking about some insane Nazi occult/necromancy here. I just could not find much about this movie I liked.Wait for this one to come out at red box.",Overlord
795,vesannia-85540,Mixed feelings,4,10 February 2019,"The protagonist was SO irritatingly ""good"" and moral and even though you may think, it's a guy who has never been to war, his actions and attitude in all of the movie are so idiotic, maybe you needed a guy to be like him to make the plot evolve, but this guy's way of always trying to do ""the right thing"" in the most nagging way ruined (at least for me) what it was supposed to be just a fun zombie-nazi movie.Appart from that, it's not that bad, it was fun to watch",Overlord
796,neurosmiles,This is like Planet Terror for 10 year olds.,5,6 February 2019,"I was really looking forward to this with strong reviews on IMDB 7+ and 80% Plus on Imdb. If you are into horror, war, or zombie movies pass on this. It's like it was made for christians or something.",Overlord

Its all downhill from there .... Not so good acting , not that good a plot , and almost all the movie is filled with crap, doing illogical things.
God knows how angry i am right now at the people rating this movie a 7 8 9 or even 10",Overlord
799,sydshanshala,"Think Suicide Squad, but even worse.",1,13 February 2019,"It's the same feeling I had after seeing Super 8. Utter dissatisfaction. The feeling that I, without any experience making films or writing scripts, could've scooped a better movie out of my cats litter box.
Completely vapid, emotionless, lacking any cohesive tone. Beat for beat ripped off Band of Brothers during the drop sequence. At times the movie doesn't even seem to take the only lesson it has to offer seriously, that Nazis are bad. They shoot a woman in the head while dragging her son off and then it cuts directly to a kid doing a ""stand behind you jump scare"" (his second in 5minutes) played for laughs. Utterly tasteless and left me confused as to what exactly I'm supposed to be feeling there.Although the idea of black paratroopers in mixed units in WW2 is absurd enough, I could've easily overlooked that if the movie distracted me with interesting plot points. Sadly that didn't happen, so I was left with the cliche sensitive main character whose the only guy in his unit with a heart, and who also doesn't visually fit the period. Then we got another totally forgettable action hero Ripley super girl derivative and macho good guy 80s Kurt Russell rip-off soldier. Just ughhhh.After what seemed like about an hour and a half of boring meandering scenes I paused it to grab a drink and MY GOD, i was only 40 minutes in. I literally felt depressed and tired after only 40 minutes of this total hack film going nowhere and expecting you to assume it's actually just clever.I don't watch war movies to feel that way, I don't watch zombie movies to feel that way, and I NEVER watch b movies to feel that way.",Overlord
800,fastrazer,Couldn't even watch the whole thing.,1,18 February 2019,At first I thought it was a comedy. Horribly inaccurate. The only thing they got right was Hitler's name. Very boring overall just wasn't for me had to turn it off about 20 minutes in.,Overlord
