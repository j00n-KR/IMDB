0,Leofwine_draca,Stand-alone thriller with a mish-mash of intriguing themes,7,28 June 2011,"A tale of sexual harassment in the office with a twist – this time, the guy is the victim and the woman the pursuer. Yes, it's another thriller that builds on Michael Douglas's typecasting as a victim of powerful women (following FATAL ATTRACTION and BASIC INSTINCT) but this one plays all the right cards. Part workplace drama, part courtroom thriller, and all the time invested with now-dated-but-then-cutting-edge technology (email, virtual reality) I found Disclosure to be never less than intriguing and well made. The Crichton source material helps, of course; I haven't yet seen a Crichton film that hasn't been thought-provoking and entertaining (even the worst, CONGO, isn't entirely without merit, although the book is loads better).I've been seeing a lot of Douglas in recent months and my opinion of him has steadily improved to the degree that I can't remember him giving a bad performance. He's fine here, providing a key likable anchor for the film to revolve around, and playing opposite him Demi Moore is also a surprise: she oozes sexuality and selfishness in equal measure, proving a powerful enemy at all times. Moore isn't the world's greatest actress but this might well be her best performance in a film.The courtroom scenes, tense and full of electricity, are undoubtedly the film's highlights and there are supporting actors to relish (Donald Sutherland, Allan Rich and in particular a slimy Dylan Baker). It's not a perfect film, but it is a reminder of the kind of solid, sensual thriller that got made during a sometimes forgotten decade of filmmaking.",Disclosure
1,jboothmillard,Disclosure,4,21 April 2009,"I had my predictions of this film, but I am glad I gave it a chance, based on the book from Jurassic Park writer Michael Crichton (Also producing) and directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man). Basically Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) is the computer company executive happily married with two children who loses out to a promotion to the woman he once had a thing with, his new boss Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore). One night Maredith invites Tom to her office for a quick ""meeting"", and with her new found power she tries to get her way with him, giving him a quick blow-job, even though he keeps saying ""no"", and then angrily he tries to do her, but he stops himself and leaves. The next day, Meredith is accusing Tom of sexual harassment, when in fact it was the other way round, and he is determined to sue her for the charge she herself has alleged. They don't have a proper trial, they just have an office discussion, obviously with Tom's wife Susan Hendler (Caroline Goodall) now aware of everything to watch, he and his lawyer Catherine Alvarez (Roma Maffia) fight his cause. There is some subplot of there being something going on that Tom finds out about with all the Gizmos in the company, but you can't really care about this, and it is a relief when it turns out Meredith's ""meeting"" with Tom was all caught on tape, she is fired, and Tom wins. Also starring Donald Sutherland as Bob Garvin, Dennis Miller as Mark Lewyn, Rosemary Forsyth as Stephanie Kaplan, Happiness's Dylan Baker as Philip Blackburn, Nicholas Sadler as Don Cherry, Allan Rich as Ben Heller and Suzie Plakson as Mary Anne Hunter. Besides the very erotic ""meeting"" between Douglas and Moore, a highlight for me was the nightmare where Sutherland flirts with Douglas and is about to kiss him with tongues. I can agree with the critics, this may be an unintentionally thriller, because it is all the dialogue, especially talking of sex, a penis in the mouth and panties, that makes you laugh, it also has its wittiness, so it's not a completely terrible film. Okay!",Disclosure
2,ccthemovieman-1,Very Satisfying Story,8,7 May 2006,"This was satisfying to watch, just to see justice done to an evil character (played well by Demi Moore). It's also refreshing - and astonishing - to see the flip side of the coin: a man accusing a woman of sexual harassment and proving it! What a unique twist, almost unheard of in the Liberal world of mainstream films.Michael Douglas co-stars with Moore and is good, too, but I found Douglas' lawyer ""Catherine Alvarez"" played by Roma Maffia, to be the most interesting of them all and making the most profound statements in this tale of ""power"" (not sex).Donald Sutherland gives another convincing performance as a ""bad guy"" as well. That's a role he seems best suited to play. All the actors are good on this adaption from a Michael Crichton book.The radical feminists didn't like this movie, so you know the the film has something going for it besides good acting and dialog. They want everything slanted to them, but as it's pointed out in the film, things can go both ways.....and what's wrong with an even playing field?",Disclosure
3,rmax304823,Sex and Chips.,6,26 June 2006,"In a way, this is the opposite of an LMN movie. A man (Douglas) is accused of sexual harassment by his boss (Moore). But since she was the aggressor he threatens to bring suit against her. The film turns the usual clichés upside down. Douglas finds the incident was accidentally taped on an answering machine, and at the mediation everyone hears him telling Moore ""No."" ""Doesn't 'no' mean 'no'""?, Douglas's lawyer (a woman) asks Moore? And later at the meeting we hear Douglas's lawyer come up with, ""Sexual harassment is not about sex. It's about power."" That's what's known as high-concept film making, but it's not all that simple. There's additional skulduggery involved, an attempt to sabotage Douglas's career as production manager at a computer company in Seattle.The direction, by Barry Levinson, is up to his usual standard, which is pretty good, though his forte lies in remarking small quotidian moments rather than complicated technical drama. The acting is competent too. There was, however, a dolorous moment at the end when Douglas exposes Moore's trickery in public and when she objects furiously he smirks at her like a third-grade kid who just squealed on a classmate.If there is a problem it is with the script. The story seems bifurcated. The two schemes to torpedo Douglas are only tenuously connected. Either one -- the sexual harassment business or the sabotaging of Douglas's production line -- would have been movies unto themselves. And for the most part, the dialog is functional and flat, empty of verve, except for one angry outburst by the victimized Douglas who does a neat turn while pointing out that nobody believes him because he is a stereotypical white male. Oh, and one or two other lines. When Douglas is about to sue the company they offer him a ""lateral move"" to Austin. Donald Sutherland, the boss, gets a nifty observation: ""AUSTIN? That's like a duck making a lateral move to 'a l'orange.'""Worth seeing. Imaginative and picturesque.",Disclosure
4,moonspinner55,Smug modern potboiler...,5,27 January 2008,"Not-terrible adaptation of Michael Crichton's bestseller about an honest executive at a Seattle-based computer company mixed up in office politics, corporate mergers, and he said/she said sexual misconduct. Paul Attanasio's screenplay is full of outrageous, unconvincing twists and turns, which director Barry Levinson seems to inexplicably relish in. Still, if you meet the picture half-way, it's a lot of fun on strictly a low-brow level. Michael Douglas is solid as usual, Demi Moore is agreeably villainous, but Donald Sutherland comes up with nothing new as a shady corporate head. Rather smirking and silly, though it does offer callow pleasures for those in the right mood. ** from ****",Disclosure
5,Quinoa1984,A pretty smart thriller,4,31 July 2000,"This film may not be exactly a thriller, but it comes close.  Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances here as a man who is seduced by his boss (Demi Moore who is hotter than hell) and she sues him for sexual harassment.  Good dialogue (by author Michael Chricton) and good performances make this watchable, and the plot is also kinda intelligent. Dennis Miller has a small role as a co-worker.  A-",Disclosure
6,JohnHowardReid,One for computer freaks!,8,11 June 2015,"Splendid acting from Michael Douglas, Demi Moore and Donald Sutherland save a somewhat complicated and rather computer-technical plot which doesn't make a great deal of sense if we examine it too closely. Another drawback lies in the TV-style direction by Barry Levinson, who was certainly an odd choice for director. The movie was obviously produced on a multi-million dollar budget -- thirty- two million if I remember correctly -- so why hand the reins to someone with a tunnel vision who sees everything in facial close- ups? Even minor characters who are on screen for only a minute or so get the full, stand-alone, close-up treatment. At the end of the day, we have so many unimportant faces that close-ups force us to remember that it's difficult to even keep track of the plot, let alone focus our attention on which characters are important in this never-ending parade of who the dickens is who! Even right at the very end of the movie we are still being urged via distracting close-ups to take special note of newly introduced characters who have virtually little or nothing to do with the plot whatever!",Disclosure
7,edwagreen,Disclosure is Much More Revealing ***,8,28 October 2009,"Sexual harassment in the reverse is always intriguing. That's essentially what this story is about as Michael Douglas plays the victim to his conniving boss, Demi Moore.Fine support is given to them in the film, especially by Roma Maffia, as his lawyer, Mrs. Alvarez.The picture does go down in quality once the scientific nonsense takes over. It isn't also that gratifying to learn that there is a plot not only to destroy Douglas for his sexual escapades, but that Donald Sutherland, the head of the computer firm, has conspired to deem Douglas inept at his work so as to justify his dismissal. Naturally, Douglas is able to turn the tables on all.When it finally appears that the right woman has been chosen to lead the firm during its merger, Douglas soon uncovers that this lady is up to plenty of her own tricks as well.This is an engaging film with plenty of back-stabbing in the tradition of 1950's ""All About Eve.""",Disclosure
8,sunwarrior13,Demi Moore As A Femme Fatale,9,19 September 2012,"Disclosure is a thriller directed by Barry Levinson that stars Michael Douglas and Demi Moore. It is based on Michael Crichton's novel of the same title.The cast also includes Donald Sutherland, Rosemary Forsyth and Dennis Miller.The film is a combination mystery and thriller about office politics and intrigue in the computer industry in the mid-1990s. Also,it includes the issue of sexual harassment.Tom Sanders is an executive at DigiCom, a leading computer software firm. The company is about to launch a new virtual reality-based data storage system that is expected to revolutionize the industry, and Bob Garvin, the owner of the company, is in the midst of negotiating a merger that could bring $100 million into the firm. However, while Tom is expecting a promotion, he discovers the position has been given instead to a new hire, Meredith Johnson, with whom Tom had an affair years ago, before he was married. After her first day of work, Meredith invites Tom up to her office and makes a concerted attempt to seduce him; while Tom doesn't fight off her advances with very much gusto at first, eventually he decides things have gone too far and leaves in a huff. The next morning, Meredith accuses Tom of sexual harassment, and he realizes this was merely a power ploy to get him out of DigiCom for good; Tom, determined to fight, files a counter-suit, which makes him no friends at the company, since rocking the boat too hard could very well scotch the merger.The story takes some clever twists and turns as it develops into a full- fledged psychological thriller that is effective and gripping, if occasionally contrived as a result of over-plotting.The film is genuinely gripping and well-written.As for the performances,Moore makes an awesome femme fatale while Douglas triumps over evil in a big way.But it is a watchable film as well.",Disclosure
9,hitchcockthelegend,Sexual harassment is about power. When did I have the power? When?,7,25 July 2011,"Disclosure is directed by Barry Levinson and co-adapted to screenplay by Paul Attanasio and Michael Crichton from Crichton's own novel of the same name. It stars Michael Douglas, Demi Moore, Donald Sutherland, Roma Maffia, Dylan Baker, Caroline Goodall and Rosemary Forsyth. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone.Tom Sanders (Douglas) is an executive at DigiCom, a high-tech computer company, who hopes that now it's finally his time to get promotion. Passed over for an outsider, he's further irked when it turns out to be Meredith Johnson (Moore), an old passionate flame of his from years previously. When Meredith arranges for a meeting between the two later that evening, Tom finds himself sexually harassed by her. Spurning her aggressive overtures, Tom is shocked to learn the next day that she has filed a charge of sexual harassment against him. He naturally counters the charge, but this opens up a can of worms for both him and the future of DigiCom.The 1990s practically belonged to Michael Crichton, it seemed for a time that everything he wrote was adapted to the big screen for some form of entertainment. With Jurassic Park still warm and still garnering bucket loads of cash, two other Crichton adaptations worked their way into theatres; both of which were a world away from the family friendly extravaganza of Jurassic Park. One was Rising Sun, a messy wasted potential of a movie, the other was Disclosure, a zeitgeist snatcher that seized the moment. The topic, and the novelty of flipping the gender aggressor, was always going to make Disclosure of much interest, thus the film and the novel made big money: aided still further by the hot casting of Douglas and Moore, who were still draw cards in the early 90s. Crichton, after being displeased with other adaptations of his work, got big say on the screenplay as a written project. So with director Levinson in tow, he set about pushing the buttons of his audience, attempting to continue the heated debates that were brought about previously from Douglas' Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct. If it's Crichton's or Levinson's fault that it didn't work out that way? I'm not sure, but fact is, is that Disclosure really wasn't that potent back then, and certainly now it's not even lukewarm.There's too much techno babble going on, and an over keenness to stick the nose up at the big business vultures picking the flesh off of the lesser minions. Entering the last half hour of the film, it's easy to forget there has actually been a sexual harassment case! Here's the crux of the matter, if going in to it for a first time viewing expecting this to be a powder-keg of sexual harassment muckiness and legal intrigue, then you are in for a big disappointment. I know, because I was one of the paying patrons at the theatre back in 94! You sense that one of the makers got a bit carried awayYet the film still has much going for it if stripped of that expectation, not least that it packs a pile of tension in that last half hour and the finale is rather rewarding. I'd go as far to say I'm a fan of the film, but it's not the film I originally went to see! There's a trio of interesting and differing female characters at the front of the narrative, even if Moore's stair-master vixen isn't exactly developed beyond being a bitch, and the virtual reality sequences have an appealing charm about them. The cast are turning in good ones, with a notable shout out to Caroline Goodall who wisely underplays it as the wife. While the interior set design (Gary Lewis/Joseph Hodges) for the DigiCom HQ is wonderful with its 90s excess of glass meeting mirrors and open spaces. Which leaves us with what?A film that is not what you expect! Which in this case is both disappointing and a surprise. 7/10",Disclosure

It is a Competently Made Story About Corporate Intrigue and Sexual Harassment. None of it is Surprising or Thrilling for that Matter. It is Sort of Hollywood Gloss Trying to be Relevant.It Might be Prescient in the ""newly discovered"" World of Workplace Power Plays Between the Sexes, but its Computerese and Techno-Babble Made Here to be Cutting Edge is Hopelessly Dated Out of the Box.

But the Movie is of Two Minds and Neither Comes Out Smelling Very Well. The Movie doesn't Stink but Considering the Talent Involved, Director Barry Levinson, the Cast and the Michael Crichton Source Material, it is Flat and Fatuous.Note...In this Movie Dennis Miller tries yet another career move, from Comedian to Actor to Sports Commentator to Radio Talk Show Host, and finally as a Flunky for Bill O' Reilly.

11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Smart,7,18 October 2009,"I have not read the Crichton novel, so I cannot compare the two. It's too seldom you see a thriller that really *works* without the threat being that of the protagonist(s) being physically harmed by someone chasing and/or attacking them. After his new female boss throws herself(quite literally) at him, Tom Sanders is in trouble. Who's going to believe him? The allegation sounds absurd, it seems. This is a believable scenario, and it remains that way through most of the film. The plot is interesting, and the twists and turns are unexpected. This has a marvelous pace, and it's never boring. It's exciting from start to finish. The leads have great chemistry, and all parts are well-cast. Every acting performance is riveting. Douglas, Moore and Sutherland are of course magnificent, and Miller is spot-on in a role that you can tell, as the Trivia confirms, was written to fit him. Cinematography and editing are good. The special effects do look a tad dated, and I'm not sure the film absolutely needed that portion, but they do the job fine. Computers and such in this are not completely credible, it is Hollywood after all. This touches upon important subjects, and treats them with respect. Barry Levinson does an impeccable job directing. There is no nudity, one sequence of strong sex, and a moderate amount of unrestrained language in this. I recommend this to any fan of those involved in making it and/or the book(possibly). 7/10",Disclosure
12,neil-476,Another Crichton winner,8,15 September 2012,"Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) not only finds himself passed over for an expected promotion, but his new boss turns out to be an old flame, Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore). When Meredith makes strong overtures to him, Tom initially goes along, only to refuse her. Furious at his rejection, Meredith accuses him of sexual harassment, so he makes a counter-accusation.Set against the corporate and executive positioning of a complex business deal, Michael Crichton's story (oh how we miss that man's creative output) strikes an interesting balance between techno-thriller, sexual politics commentary, courtroom drama, and urban paranoia thriller. The story is terrific - complex but always followable, gripping and involving, and with emotional ramifications as the essentially decent and blameless Sanders finds himself in an impossible situation.This is a good film, with one of the best payoffs ever, and I recommend it.",Disclosure

Help and wit is sometimes needed in life.  Moore plays a very mean person, perfectly.  Her most believable role to date.  The more times they show it on TBS the more times I like it.  Sutherland does a good creep also. I wonder if these actors behave this way in real life.  The movie is a bit graphic, not for kids.  I wonder why Michael Douglas always gets into these bad sex situations. (Fatal and Basic)  Watch it on TBS. Give it a grade of 70%  I would love to see part 2.

15,Mr-Fusion,Stick with the book. No good comes from this.,3,30 August 2012,"Everybody's out to get Michael Douglas.Marketed as a controversial examination of a man's charge of sexual harassment against a female co-worker, ""Disclosure"" is really about paranoia. The reverse discrimination angle is a (albeit large) plot point, but it isn't the crux of the movie. Which is where the movie takes a sharp turn off a cliff.Douglas is a software engineer for a large corporation, and he's been turned down for the big promotion - in favor of a man-eating former lover (Demi Moore). Moore, the new V.P. invites Douglas to her office for a catch-up session, and things get downright steamy. But Douglas is a family man, and he walks away from an enraged (rebuffed) Moore. The next day, Douglas walks into the office to the accusation that he was the one doing the harassing. A very large chunk of the movie is devoted to the harassment charge, with Douglas calling in the help of a media-hungry lawyer (Roma Maffia) to help him with his case. Sordid details emerge, cracks appear in the Douglas household, and and it's not a pretty skirmish. But Moore is just a cog in a larger scheme to eventually make Douglas look incompetent and throw him out on the street. That's what this movie is really about: Douglas is worried about his job. It's all a very conspiratorial and manipulative oppression of the poor white family man, complete with hushed voices in the office. Throw in some deliciously early '90s CGI and a ridiculously lame virtual reality subplot, and you've got the market fresh makings of an overly- long film that never rises above goofy.3/10; a real chore",Disclosure

Only to find out later that his whole life and career is on the line when he's accused of sexual harassment, the tables are turned only as he later finds out this is all a game of company conspiracy and sexual politics, the Sanders character is one you cheer for to win his lawsuit and career. I'm thankful for Barry Levinson and Michael Crichton who show with this film that sexual harassment can come from a female instead of a male. Men are sometimes wrongly stereotyped as the predators instead of the prey, and that many women in the workforce have ego problems and power trips just like the Moore character.

21,thesar-2,'A Friend' Recommends 'Disclosure',8,20 September 2009,"After recently watching the enormously disappointing 'Obsessed,' a movie that truly mocked (notice: not copied) 'Disclosure,' I had to watch one of my favorites from years past again. It helps that I love Seattle, a place I've visited once and that was enough to plan to move there one day. I don't see too many movies based there, so that was more motivation to watch this again. Though 'Disclosure' wasn't perfect – there were too many scenes where the characters all but turned to the camera to explain a plot point or what a CD-Rom drive does, it was a highly entertaining suspense movie that didn't involve a murder or even attempted murder. I liked that, as most suspense thrillers, namely Douglas's own movies ('Basic Instinct' and 'Fatal Attraction,') do involve police, murders, killers or psychos. This was all corporate intrigue and a twist on the age-old sexual harassment. Douglas's family man, Sanders, is up for a promotion in his computer firm, but is passed over for his ex, Moore's Johnson. Not 24 hours into the job, she seduces him in quite a graphic scene and then accuses him of sexual harassment. I'm not giving anything away; that is the set-up. But why would she? What can he do to keep his job and family together with a lawsuit, or pink slip, hovering over him during a major merger of the company? There's a lot of suspense, mystery, good acting, dialogue and originality here. Sure, it's enormously dated – in reference to the ""modern computer gadgets,"" but everything else is still fresh. I loved the main setting, his office, I loved the Sutherland tongue scene (hilarious) and the simple fact that the wife was supportive and real, unlike jealous and distracting Beyonce in 'Obsessed.' Highly recommended just for an easy-to-follow thriller/movie night.",Disclosure
22,sol1218,I'm Screwed!,6,16 June 2006,"**SPOILERS** The movie ""Disclosure"" is more about corporate climbing and back-stabbing then sexual harassment like your made, by it's advertising campaign, to believe it is. There's the handsome and personable, as well as highly competent, head of manufacturing at the giant computer chip company Digicom Tom Sanders, Michael Douglas, being passed up for the vice president slot at the company for the very sexy and conniving head of operations Meredith Johnson, Demi Moore.Were informed very early in the film by Tom, to his fellow employees, that he and Meredith had a very serious sexual relationship years ago before he married his wife Susan, Corline Goodell, which makes Tom even more upset that his former lover will now be his boss at Digicon. Swallowing his pride and taking the whole thing, his being passed up for promotion, in stride Tom sees nothing suspicious in being invited by his new boss Meredith to her pad after work to discuss business matters. Before he can get to the bottom line of the weekly profit report Tom ends up being attacked set upon and almost raped by a very wild and aggressive Meredith, acting like a young filly in heat, that has him run for his life out of her apartment, almost tripping over himself, with his pants still hanging down to his knees.Back at work the next day Tom, who was willing to put the whole sordid episode with Meredith behind him,is slapped with a sexual harassment suit by Meredith which can not only cost him his job but his marriage and reputation and make him virtually unemployable in the computer software business.

Tom really gets a big lift in his hard fought efforts to exonerate and free himself from the tight and suffocating strangle hold that Meredith has on him when he recovers a tape that was made when he called, or miscalled, someone from work Mark Lewyn, Dennis Miller,to confirm his meeting with his boss just seconds before the out of control, and hot to trot, Meredith assaulted him at her suite that recorded an X-rated ten minute blow by blow description of the entire shocking incident. It's then when you, and Tom, realize the real purpose behind Meredith's strange and bizarre behavior and it doesn't have at all to do with Tom's sexy goods looks, which must have come as a big shock and disappointment to him, but with him being in the position of exposing her even more stranger managerial habits and activities back at the Digicom main computer chip plant in Kuala Lumpur Malasya the year before that is now costing the company tens of millions of dollars, in lost revenue from defective computer chips, that the sneaky Meredith want's to have the unsuspecting Tom take the blame for but first she has to get him fired so he won't have access to the company's files and records to prove his innocence and at the same time Meredith's guilt.Somewhat decent, but very complicated, movie about the movers and shakers in the top positions of cooperate America and how they use their power and influence, and in the case of Meredith Johnson her very sexy body, to get ahead and stay on top using all the assets available to them to keep up and coming young hot-shots as well as those senior executives over them from unseating and preventing them from reaching and staying on their high perch in the company that their employed at.",Disclosure
23,lesleyharris30,"Nowhere Near as Interesting as it seems,",5,13 August 2015,"Disclosure is a mediocre movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a great cast. It's simply not as interesting as it seems, the title, the poster, the two lead roles, it all seemed like a very exciting film, and with the casting of Michael Douglas and the story set up, I was going in to this expecting another movie like Basic Instinct, and because of that I was left very disappointed with this dialogue based drama that desperately tries to put you at the edge of your seat several times, but it never really succeeds as a thriller. The performances are definitely the best part, the cast did the best they could with this mediocre script, Michael Douglas may not be playing another Gordon Gekko performance, but his pure natural ability for acting is always evident, and Demi Moore shines as the films antagonist, a very different role for her, the scenes between these two characters alone are the best parts, excluding the brutal ""alternate reality"" scene. What bothered me the most about this movie is that it all only really revolves on one scene, one moment that sums up the entire film, when Moore's character seduces Douglas's, the moments leading up to this don't feel hugely important, neither do any scenes after, there is no part after this that is any bit as exciting as that was, which is a shame since it happens within the first thirty minutes, and you're left with a story that drags on from this moment for another ninety minutes. It certainly has some qualities, but there is too much wrong with Disclosure to possibly recommend it. A man must fight for his career after a sexual harassment claim.

Anyway, I've watched it last night and though tonally it's pretty strange - it's mostly a film that time has not been kind too.Michael Douglas (right in the middle of his sex/thriller run) plays Tom Sanders, a manufacturing executive in a Seattle tech company that's about to go through a lucrative merger. A few days before the Merger is due to go through, a Vice-President role, which Tom was up for goes to Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore) a former lover of Tom's before he settled down. On her first evening, Meredith calls Tom to her office and tries to rekindle their physical relationship, which he declines. The following morning Meredith accuses Tom of sexual harassment in the workplace, which he counters by contacting a solicitor and accusing her of the same thing.The film is now 24 years old, so it's not surprising that a film that was at the cutting edge of technology at the time is now hilariously out of date. Much of the plot revolves around the construction of CD Disk drives. There are email, web sites and video calls all of which look incredibly primitive to today's eyes but most bizarre of all is the VR representation of the company's main storage drive - which is then deleted in one of the funniest dramatic sequences of all time, towards the films climax. Humorous as all this is, it's not really fair to criticise the film for it a quarter of a century later.It's much fairer though to criticise the film for its strange tone. Ostensibly advertised as an erotic thriller, though there's only one sex scene and it's not particularly titillating. The film then spends a lot of time pretending it's a legal drama, then a tech thriller before finally ending with the merger nonsense. I'm not sure it does a great job of explaining what's actually happening in the scheme that the film hinges on. I think I worked it out afterwards but I did have to sit and think about it for a while. Throughout all that, there's odd moments of humour - occasionally almost slapstick that jar with the rest of the film.I don't want to get too down on the film as it was successful at the time, but I have to say that ""mild boredom"" was my most common experience throughout the runtime and I won't be back to see it again any time soon.",Disclosure

Going to see it on the first day with my folks, which was a hot one, here was a film, Douglas fitted perfectly. As seeing him in many other tough roles, here he puts down is dukes, in what is one of his best performances. Disclosure is basically a revenge tale, where we have advanced in the computer age, and as you know, revenge is sweet. Having partially read the novel, as they're was much talk of demographics, computer chips, where I'd much more prefer the movie, the lengthy film has old jilted flame, Demi Moore taking Douglas step up role in this computer business, where she's now his boss. I must say, I liked Moore's performance, here. She plays the bitch so well. She sets up a private liason with Douglas in her office at the computer plant, to talk over some business, and it isn't soon before he's seduced by her, letting her do her thing, because of the weaker position he holds, and he is too, a week character which again, he wonderfully play. He bails, Moore threatening to destroy him, and this was her plan all along. What begins is a long draining court process with wifee (Goodall), where Moore claims rape, and with a merger coming up, this is the worst possible timing. The film was very interesting in the way the legal process was handled from both sides. Quite in-depth, Moore disputing a lot, saying Douglas came onto her, where his hope dwindles more and more. He hires a woman solicitor, (Roma Mafia) the scene stealer here, who has a speciality in these cases and she is good. I loved near the end when Douglas put on that computer equipment, I found myself dizzy watching it. Sutherland is great and slightly menacing as the company's big boss. But really, the film is really blown out of light plot, and a lot of times it strangely feels like it veers away from it's story of harassment, where our big boys at the computer office, are more interested with the merger going through, instead of Douglas's troubles. The film, which is a little slick is still worth a watch, if for Douglas fans, and as for Moore's character in the end, that is something that's very much disclosed.",Disclosure

When Tom Sanders(Michael Douglas) agrees to work with his boss(Moore) late at night, she really gets the term ""going below the belt"" in which she does, he gets frightened easily. When things were about to go downhill for Sanders, everyone he works for comes to his aid. Knowing Johnson is a liar and manipulator, she admits her aggressiveness and she really gives herself a bad name to the company and herself. To me that's no surprise. All the support Tom had really comes from a person named A. Friend, which I'm not revealing here. The virtual reality scene makes this movie more interesting to watch as well.

In this sexually updated story, Bob Garvin (Donald Sutherland) is a corporate president of a prestigious computer giant who selects, Tom Sanders, (Michael Douglas) a married design executive for dismissal and hires a beautifully seductive woman executive, Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore) to set him up for sexual harassment. Establishing a rape charge against Sanders is easily enough, but is aptly challenged convincingly by Sander's exceptional attorney, Catherine Alvarez (Roma Maffia). Since the company want to insure Sander's dismissal, a second charge is presented at a stockholder's meeting, where Johnson will seek his dismissal for managerial incompetence. The storyline is in direct conjunction with modern trials in this country often concocted by unscrupulous ambulance chasing attorneys.

Some astounding effects, superb acting, taught editing, astute directing and a great soundtrack ensure Barry Levinson's 90's thriller is tense from the outset, and has that computer age edge.I will be the first to admit that I'm tiring of Michael Douglas' repetitive role choices. He seems rather drawn to the ""innocent man being victimised by the unstable woman"" scenario. ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""Basic Instinct"" are two very good examples of this, but even ""The War of the Roses"" may be placed in the same category. This recurring theme of nasty femme fatales in Douglas' movies has upset several women's groups in the States who have subsequently boycotted ""Disclosure"". Though I would whole-heartedly agree that he needs a change in direction and some different roles, I still believe Michael Douglas to be a fine actor, and in ""Disclosure"" he delivers a solid performance as Tom Sanders, a married business man whose new boss turns out to be an ex-lover with whom he had a torrid affair before he settled down. When the two meet in her office after hours to discuss ""work"", she makes advances that set off a chain of events that turn Sander's world upside down. As the vindictive Meredith Johnson, Demi Moore fits the bill most admirably, and movie-goers will have no problem developing a distinct disliking for her.A strong support cast backs up the leading pair with showings from Donald Sutherland, Caroline Goodall, Dylan Baker and Nicholas Sadler that are right on the mark.Maestro Ennio Morricone again expands his movie music repertoire with a pounding score that is truly relentless. Director Levinson maintains this pace with a narrative (adapted form Crichton's novel by Paul Attanasio) that keeps your heart racing, whilst always having a sharp sense of humour. Mr. Levinson certainly knew how to make the most of Crichton's dazzling, tense and immensely pleasurable story.And of course the one thing that really makes ""Disclosure"" most effective is the believable characters.

I can't tell which applies to Michael Douglas, but I think its a little of each.  In 'Fatal Attraction', he has an weekend-long affair with the anti-Christ and pays for it in spades.  In 'Basic Instinct' he is never sure if he is going to get killed or seduced by Sharon Stone.  In this movie, his feelings are hurt that Demi Moore is more masculine than he is. 
All the female characters I've mentioned are more masculine than Mikey, come to think of it.  He gets sexually attacked by Demi, on her first night as his boss, but he stops them mid-stream. This is a little much to..(please excuse the expression)..SWALLOW, and the sight of Demi running after him, ordering him to 'finish what he started', has nothing on Neely O'Hara's confrontation with the demons from her past in an alleyway in 'Valley of the Dolls.'He decides to sue the company but remains a weiner.  He gets a masculine woman, Roma Maffia (she's the only reason to endure this), to do his bidding for him.  She wins, of course, cause he's the hero and Demi is the predator, as designed.  Quite alot remains unquestioned.  Why he would want to work there, after he finds out that they intended to get rid of him, is anyone's guess.  Why Demi allowed herself to be treated so badly, when she is obviously a shark, is open for discussion.  Why Barry Levinson directed this yawner is another good one, and why you'd want to sit through it, too...Oh, and Michael...chin up, you'll work it out..",Disclosure

I loved this movie, I don't care how silly many thought it was, it was high energy and riveting. Disclosure does what many psychological thrillers simply do not do and that is to really keep you on the edge of your seat. The beauty of this movie is your never bored. Ever. Obviously the movie had flaws. I could have lived without that whole scene between Douglas and Moore(it was a bit much) and the angel scene, where Tom almost gets caught by the corporate executives, while fascinating became a bit silly and over the top. There were a few scenes that maybe shouldn't have been there as the movie probably would have been taken a bit more seriously if they were not. There is the fact though, that this movie really does keep you glued to your seat with it's story of greed and betrayal in corporate America. The enfolding of the Plot is edge of your seat excitement. I had read the book to and the movie keeps pace with the novel well. I enjoyed this much more then some of Demi's other movies(Indecent Proposal, Striptease). They were great books and horrendous movies, this movie manages to be almost equal to the book.The two leads basically play the same character in every movie but it was perfect casting. Call it cheesy but the movie really had it all-suspense,Drama, bad guys, good guys, good acting, a bit of Science Fiction, fast moving plot(complex while somehow USUALLY avoiding complete absurdity)and interesting Characters. Unfortunately, many remember this for the pathetically commercial Demi Moore sex scene but hey-whatever sells movie tickets.The plot and the events leading up to the unraveling of it are, for the most part, top notch.

40,philip_vanderveken,The only plus about this movie is that it tries to be original.,7,1 February 2005,"Even though I've read a lot of bad comments about ""Disclosure"", I can't say that it is such an awful movie. Not that it is surprisingly good or special, but at least it tries to be original.It's about Tom Sanders, a happily married man who works as a computer expert for some company that develops new computer technologies. He is hoping for a big promotion, but much to his surprise he doesn't get it. It's an ambitious and sexy woman from outside the company that gets the job and to make things worse for him: she is one of his ex-girlfriends. But she isn't looking for revenge, apparently he must have done something right during their relationship, because almost immediately she tries to pick up where they left off. But being a good husband, he manages to resist her temptations. As his position at work comes under increasing pressure he decides to file charges of sexual harassment. Not that anyone believes him. Everybody thinks that he is the one to blame, that he sexually harassed his boss, because she got the job in stead of him. The company, not really pleased with this kind of publicity, will do everything to get rid of him as soon as possible.If there is one thing that I like about this movie, than it must be the fact that it actually tries to change some role patterns. This movie seems to say that it doesn't always have to be men that harass the women, it can also be the opposite and perhaps that's true. Does that mean that I, being a man myself, approve of sexual harassment on the work floor when it is done by a man? No, certainly not, but I always like to see a new approach to problems and this is certainly something different from what we are used to hear and see.The acting and the story are reasonable, but certainly not world shocking. If it hadn't been for this original ""twist"", I'm sure this movie wouldn't even have made it to the multiplexes, but would have been released as a TV-movie or would have gone straight to video. However, there was something that really bothered me in this movie: all that Sci-Fi stuff in it. All the ""technology"" that is shown in it as being part of the product line developed by Tom Sanders' team probably needed to give this movie an extra cool touch, but it now just looks dated and most of all very ridiculous.

In the workplace, where social conventions, various legal constraints and political correctness all come into play, there is still no escape from the kind of management conspiracies, office politics and duplicity which are depicted so effectively in ""Disclosure"" or the kinds of distrust and paranoia that they can so easily generate.Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) heads one of the divisions of a Seattle computer company and is engaged in the development of a product which is vitally important to the success of a planned and very lucrative merger with another company. There are some problems with the product which Tom and his team are currently dealing with and are under considerable pressure to resolve.As a result of some changes which are taking place within the company, Tom's confident that he'll be promoted but it soon transpires that he's been passed over and the job has been given to one of his ex-girlfriends, Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore). On her first day in the job, Meredith arranges a late meeting with Tom to discuss his division's work but during their meeting she aggressively tries to seduce him and is furious when, after a considerable struggle, she's unsuccessful.Meredith responds to Tom's rejection by accusing him of sexual harassment and asserting that in the circumstances, there's no way that she'd be able to work with him again. The company want to avoid any publicity that could have an adverse impact on the upcoming merger and so try to get Tom to take a transfer to another job in their Austin branch. He can't countenance this idea because of the negative effect it would have on his career and is in a very tight spot. Help unexpectedly arrives in the form of an anonymous e-mail which recommends that he consult an attorney called Catherine Alvarez (Roma Maffia) who's a specialist in sexual harassment cases.Tom decides to fight back and files a counter-suit. The process he has to go through to achieve justice is difficult and painful but irrefutable proof of his innocence is produced and the company agrees to retain him and give him a pay rise.The relief that Tom feels after being cleared of the charges against him is short lived as it quickly becomes apparent that efforts which were originally initiated by Meredith to make him look incompetent have now drawn wider support and he's being set up to be publicly humiliated and undermined at a high profile shareholders' meeting. The way in which Tom copes with this threat then provides the story with its intriguing conclusion.The events in ""Disclosure"" all take place within the space of one intense week in which Tom's normally affluent and comfortable lifestyle is disrupted as his disappointment at being passed over for promotion turns into discomfort when he discovers the identity of his new boss and then horror as he's threatened with the loss of his job, his wife, his family and his stock options.The false accusation made against him, the plots to make him look incompetent and a workplace where no one can be trusted, create a climate of paranoia which is reinforced when some of his previous innocent actions are characterised as something more sinister and the support of his colleagues is systematically eroded by those high up in the company structure.Michael Douglas gives a good solid performance as the beleaguered Tom and Demi Moore is marvellous as the cold and cruel villain of the piece. Donald Sutherland and Roma Maffia also stand out in their supporting roles.",Disclosure
44,RNMorton,Solid Douglas,9,26 September 2003,"Michael's in distress, but this time with a better, more bearable plot. More so than revealing the ""flip side"" of sexual harassment, what this movie excels in is showing, vividly and accurately, how incredibly arbitrary and screwed up American corporate management can be.

45,hall895,Full disclosure: this movie stinks,3,17 January 2013,"I suppose the idea of Michael Douglas being sexually harassed by Demi Moore could be intriguing. Could be. But in this movie it doesn't end up being intriguing at all. The story fizzles out before it ever really gets going. The movie goes on and on without ever really going anywhere. There's no spark, no sizzle. Attempts at humor fall horribly flat. The only laughs in this movie come from laughing at just how bad it is, most notably in the big climactic virtual reality scene. Wait, big climactic virtual reality scene? Yeah, it's just as stupid as it sounds, an awful idea executed so badly you can't help but laugh at how truly terrible it is. This is a movie which fails in pretty much every way possible.Douglas plays Tom Sanders, the head of production at some high-tech Seattle outfit. There's a big merger on the horizon, Tom expects a big promotion to go with it. But the job he covets goes to Meredith Johnson, a one-time girlfriend of his who celebrates their reunion by trying to rape him in her office. When Tom says no, not before having a little fun of course because the movie needs its obligatory sex scene, Meredith promises to ruin him. And the next day she duly accuses him of sexual harassment. He gets himself a lawyer, accuses her and it's a big he-said, she-said deal which only serves to bore those of us who are unfortunate enough to be watching. Drama and tension are in very short supply. Tedium is the order of the day. Moore's absolutely atrocious acting doesn't help matters. My goodness, she is terrible. The story slogs along, everyone ganging up on poor Tom in some horribly uninteresting conspiracy. It's not just Meredith out to get him, this goes all the way up to the big boss at the top. That character, played by Donald Sutherland, is I suppose meant to seem sinister but the way Sutherland mugs and overacts he just comes off as a buffoon. Just another example of the way this movie completely misses the mark. And just when you think it can't possibly get any worse along comes that absurd virtual reality scene which is simply one of the dumbest things ever seen in any movie. Even after that laughable ""climax"" the movie doesn't have the decency to just end. More pointless, boring twists to come. The whole thing is just interminable. Movies don't get much worse than this.",Disclosure

The plot is well-known enough not to be summarized here, but suffice it to say that this movie is loaded with crackling drama, edge-of-your-seat suspense, witty and snappy dialogue (best line - Garvin, on transferring Sanders to Austin: ""Making a lateral move to Austin is like a duck making a lateral move to 'a l'orange'"".) and a celluloid-melting seduction scene. Excellent acting all around (I like Michael Douglas, I don't care what they say), and the movie captures in a visceral way the high-powered, high-stakes, cutthroat world of business politics in the world of leading edge computer hardware and software development. My wife and I both give this one a straight 'A'.",Disclosure

Linda Fiorentino's cold hearted character livens things up to become entertainingly devilish, Moore is too angelic for her protagonist's own good, and Michael Douglas' most boring character in the world does little too help the plot.The tagline ""sex is power"" may sound good and controversial but this plot seems to base itself on one poorly directed sex scene and using concepts of blackmail and family wellbeing to convey good over evil and power over weakness. Disclosure is too awkwardly balancing on its thin wire of this sex concept and it tries to make a court case of supposed harassment that is ludicrous. The prospect the script offers before you see it is reasonably promising. Demi Moore is a talented attractive actress who doesn't live up to her great performance in A Few Good Men.Michael Douglas having starred in Basic Instinct and other erotic thriller Fatal Attraction beforehand you would imagine is pretty used to this genre by now, but what went wrong? He is undoubtedly the most boring cinema creation ever created.Disclosure has many faults but there are some perks towards the end. After seeing a weakness in Moore's Meredith, a tension arises and the feeling of hope isn't too badly scripted you want to fit Disclosure in the cheesy collection. Whereas there aren't any twists the suspense coming to the finale may encourage you to finish. And despite the poorly balanced portrayal of controversial concepts, there is still sustained interest.One exceptionally bad element also is the science fiction part of Douglas' job. This whole computer generated imagery may look fancy but is a complete concept of waffle that is never fully explained, not to forget that Sanders' ambition for the promotion doesn't help you liking him as he doesn't work properly in the film's entirety till the final ten minutes. For a good drama thriller, The Last Seduction or Basic Instinct are the best.",Disclosure

The first one of Douglas is Black Rain (1989) I already review that movie and this is his second movie that is favorite of mine. This a thriller that it is actually based on the novel by Michael Crichton's novel with the same name who also wrote the novel for Jurassic Park (1993) and the sequel The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). I love this film to death, when I saw the first time this film a teen been in a high school, I kept watching it was so interesting. It's a damn shame that they don't make em like this anymore. Sexual harassment is not about sex. It is about power. She has it; you don't.Disclosure (1994) is Michael Douglas best very underrated and criticized high-tech erotic, sexual politic, bristling thriller. It is a sleek sensual cybernetic flick. I really disagree with people including film critics about this film that is awful, I think is well made and it shows what is about sexual harassment, here is the first time we see a woman sexual harassing a happy married good heart men and than accusing him of sexual harassment and in his office his co executive superiors are accusing him been a rapist. This awesome amazing film shows than even females are sexually harassing men even men can become a victims not all the women's are victims sometimes men can become a victims too.Plot: A computer specialist is sued for sexual harassment by a former lover turned boss who initiated the act forcefully, which threatens both his career and his personal life.His career. His marriage. His future. It's all on the line for DigiCom executive Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas). He rejected the passionate advance of his new boss (Demi Moore). Now she's charging him with sexual harassment. Suddenly, long-time company man Tom must scramble for his corporate life - a scramble that will lead him into the dazzling cyberworld of DigiCom's new virtual reality corridor...and lay bare a shocking conspiracy among key company personnel.This film was written by novel from Michael Crichton and it was directed by Barry Levinson, 2. years later Barry Levinson directed Sleepers which I liked that film too. I love Michael Douglas and I have been his fan since my childhood when saw his film Romancing the Stone that was my first film I saw as a kid when Michael Douglas started in a main role. Michael Douglas is more known for thrillers because he made them a lot. Black Rain, Disclosure, The Game and Basic Instinct and I think it is Traffic are my top 5 Michael Douglas films. I remember seeing the trailer on TV in 1994 when this movie come out in the theaters. Michael Douglas gives a masterfully acting performances playing his character. Nick Conklin, Tom Sanders, Nicholas Van Orton, Detective Nick Curran and Robert Wakefield are actually my favorite characters Michael Douglas played. I also enjoy beautiful music score from Ennio Morricone who also made a beautiful theme music score for Spaghetti western movies A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and For a Few Dollars More (1965).I love in this film how Tom Sanders life is upside down and he has to fight to clear his name, his marriage and his job. The rest of the supporting cast also did a terrific job portraying their characters: Demi Moore was brilliant as the villain in here, I love her as a bad guy. Donald Sutherland as president of the company was amazing and awesome as another villain. Roma Maffia as a lawyer was outstanding in this flick. Suzie Plakson was awesome as Tom Sanders co worker, Nicholas Sadler was incredible as Don Cherry. Jacqueline Kim was amazing as Tom's secretary and Rosemary Forsyth was convincing.I am giving this film a 10 out of 10 and again I love this film to death I disagree with people who are dissing this movie off. In my opinion Disclosure is Miles way better than Fatal Attraction. That movie get's thumbs up and this one get's thumbs down that's wrong.Disclosure is a 1994 semi-erotic thriller film directed by Barry Levinson, starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore.

One day, prepared to receive a well-deserved promotion, he's in for a shock.

Together with his well-known lawyer, he must fight with his company which is determined to destroy him using all possible means.It's a psychological movie which will show you how can a person become attacked, blackmailed and betrayed by a company who wants to get rid of him no matter what. It features a very complex plot, full of unexpected events, with a couple of well-described characters which contribute to a very interesting idea. A very good movie without any doubt!",Disclosure

Sexual harassment of males by female superiors may be rare (and more likely than harassment of females by males to go unreported) but it takes place. Both Michael Douglas and Demi Moore are playing against type; only Donald Sutherland fits his character like a glove. But it's a reasonably good film and the major scene in which Moore's character is exposed as a liar and schemer works well, though with a boat load of improbable touches. If it makes the corporate world look like a jungle with predators around every bend, well, if you've been exposed to the corporate world it isn't much of a stretch.",Disclosure
53,Ben_Cheshire,"Taut psychological suspense, good performances. Didn't like the sci-fi stuff!",7,27 June 2004,"Tense thriller mixes legal suspense, gender-role debate and technology-based action, with mixed results. In fact, its all good except for the computer stuff. The firm which the film revolves around is Digicom (a bit too made-up sounding for my liking), a computer technology firm. We're told at the beginning that the firm is developing a new technology, which will be used as collateral in the upcoming merger. They develop a sort of virtual reality file-scanning system, which doesn't make file-searching any easier whatsoever, but is more like an unnecessary toy for show - but it plays a part late in the film that, for me, was my only complaint about the film. All of a sudden, we go into the machine, and it just sticks out like a sore thumb as being totally wrong for this movie - we're in a sci-fi movie all of a sudden. Plus, it was totally unnecessary. In the scene straight after, the character reports what they discovered in the machine, so it was more for show than relevance - but it ends up hurting the consistency of the film for those five minutes.This film suffers a little from the same thing the Sandra Bullock vehicle The Net suffers from - in hindsight, now that we've all just accepted the internet and computers as a helpful part of our daily existence, all these old fears we had seem slightly silly. Its a bit like looking back at those Y2K scares and thinking how ridiculous we were to be so afraid. Unlike The Net, though, technology-phobia is only in the subplot of this film. Its more about what happens between Michael Douglas and Demi Moore late one night at the office, and what happens afterwards.Its very wordy - so be prepared for that. A couple of early dialogue scenes should have been rewritten with the dialogue absent, and told with a couple of thoughtful extended shots. But maybe i only think that because i've just gotten into Antonioni. He really makes this movie look reliant on words.
The sex scene is so well choreographed as to feed an entire movie's worth of plot. Its sexy - true, Demi Moore radiates sex appeal like you wouldn't believe - its an incredible scene to watch. But its stict mechanics are also very necessary for the rest of the plot. Its one of the most necessary and justified sex scenes i've ever seen.Overall, it works. Its a tense thriller with two really incredible performances from the leads. I don't think its an essential movie, and its not particularly pleasant, if that's what you're after, but if you want a good tense thriller (which many of us do), this is worth a rental. Plus, we feel for Michael Douglas and want things to turn out good for him. So in that way, i think it deserves a workmanlike 7/10.",Disclosure
54,caa821,One major hole on second view,8,11 May 2008,"I first saw this film several years ago, and I remember that when I saw it then, it was at a friend's home on VHS, with several people around, and while you understood what was going on, with all the talking, interruptions, etc., everyone probably missed several details. I know I caught something in this viewing I'd missed before.Douglas' dilemma here was similar to his character's in ""Fatal Instinct"" and Harrison Ford's in ""Presemed Innocent."" Handsome, successful professional guy, with attractive wife, solid family, strays with a sexy gal, with some vivid couplings on-screen, but with dire consequences to his formerly stable work and family circumstances (Michael may not have been on as solid ground here as he had thought, before the sexual hi-jinks, as the characters in the other two). Other prior comments here have addressed in detail the juxtaposition of the sexual harassment aspect as to which sex committed the act; however, there was one major story flaw which I felt Crighton and the others should have addressed better.It was indicated that Sutherland had perhaps been the major culprit - not Moore - in wanting to oust Michael for some reason or other. This apparently unbeknown to the Douglas character, since he had expected to gain the vice presidency she received. And she had provably sabotaged the manufacturing ops in Malaysia, with the blame directed towards him as the corporation's head of manufacturing.But ------ for Pete's sake, how in the hell could she sabotage these operations by ordering shoddier parts from other than prime suppliers, specify a cheaper, less sterile quality of air in the Malaysian plant, and do some other things which mitigated manufacturing quality -- with him so clueless as to these occurrences. Didn't he ever take a look at these facilities himself? Their business being what it was, he would (or should!) have had so much detail, pictorial, verbal, and within databases and online reports, that such basic faux pas would have been unthinkable for one in his position. Hell, I'm not sure Sutherland shouldn't have axed him anyway for such negligence. Even if Moore had perhaps conspired with his key guy in Malaysia, fed some false info, etc., no firm of this type or size should have such ""holes"" in the manufacture of what were presented as perhaps the most innovative, progressive elements in the entire computer world.I'd still rate it 8*.

Michael Douglas and Caroline Goodall play the happily married couple and Demi Moore the predatory female with the hots for Douglas.  The plot is convoluted involving takeovers, technology and an old love affair.  The sexual harassment aspect seems to have been added as an afterthought and does not appear to add anything to the corporate goings on.What really rankled me were the all too obvious differences between the two women.  Demi Moore was made up and dressed up to the nines with figure-hugging dresses and killer heels.  Caroline Goodall had no hair style, no dress style and no heels.  I'm sorry if I'm going on too long about this but the contrasts were too blatant to be believable.Also unbelievable was Douglas' refusal of Moore's advances.

This is a serious problem and rarely (if ever) dealt with by Hollywood. The scenes involving this are convincing, particularly in the mediations where the chairman sides with the woman (Demi Moore) although the fact she is so sexually attractive makes the basic premise less plausible than it could have been.However the story is hobbled early on by too much 'techy' information and rather arbitrary plot details such as a mysterious email contact and a piece of evidence which magically shows up. It is not really clear why the company is spending so much time and effort trying to get rid of Michael Douglas, especially after the harassment case is settled. This leads to the final 40 minutes which are very clunky indeed. It is here that the 'techiness' really comes to the fore, and at a point when most viewers will have switched off since the real story has finished.The climactic scene in the exec meeting is very unconvincing.

What follows is a battle to save face between Douglas and Moore. This is probably Demi Moores best performance to date,she trades blows with Douglas giving a confident and suitably aggressive performance enriched with an intimidating sexual presence. The film,contrary to what the poster may have you believe, is not by any means graphic which may be why the films IMDb rating is so low but i would urge anyone interested in sexual politics in the workplace to give the film a try.Its performances and direction are not earth shattering but the idea is interesting and holds tight until the final credits.",Disclosure
60,lnvicta,"Dated as all hell, but an interesting look at how double standards affect people's views on sexual harassment in the workplace.",6,21 December 2015,"Disclosure could have been a great movie. For its time, it probably was. All the ingredients are there - capable actors, an intriguing story, not to mention the erotic greatness provided by Demi Moore. She plays the boss of Michael Douglas' character, and she invites him to her office and proceeds to make sexual advances on him, then accuses him of sexually harassing her. The movie then goes into the mediation of these claims, and these are the best scenes because it really shows how people can instinctively side with the woman in these cases despite evidence pointing to the contrary. Moore's lawyer interrogates Douglas ruthlessly, asking him leading questions and bringing up their sexual history in order to make him look as guilty as possible. And on top of all that, Douglas is a family man so it's also taking a toll on his marriage. All of these elements work.What doesn't work is the cyber-thriller aspect. The computer graphics are HORRIFIC. Even for the '90s it looks bad; these days it looks like a glitchy Atari game. And one of the main plot lines revolves around Douglas receiving messages from an anonymous source on his computer, so a lot of time is spent looking at dated interfaces. The movie's climax goes a step further and throws virtual reality into the mix, and those scenes make the X-Files episode 'First Person Shooter' look like a visual masterpiece. It really takes you out of the movie, despite Ennio Morricone's best efforts on the music front.Disclosure is certainly watchable. It has some witty and clever dialogue, it deals with serious issues in a tasteful manner, and has a wonderful sex scene that will keep your eyes glued on screen even if you detest the rest of the film.

Tom Sanders (Douglas) is the aspiring executive who sees his career derailed by a beautiful associate Meredith Johnson (Moore) with whom he once had an affair.  Almost immediately after taking a promotion that Tom felt was his, Meredith charges him with sexual harassment when he refuses her advances.The plot thickens when a proposed merger is jeopardized by the ensuing scandal.  Or is it?  Things are not always as they seem, and when the stakes are high, some people will stop at nothing.This is the best ""getting their come-uppance"" movie since Working Girl and, though lacking that films humor, it successfully dramatizes the high stakes business of high tech.  Directed by Barry Levinson who could make a reading of the phone book work and written by Michael Crichton who sometimes would do better with the phone book, Disclosure is a little uneven, but it has moments of greatness that make it well worthwhile.My favorites are Dylan Baker as the smarmy suck-up, and Dennis Miller as the wise cracking co-worker.",Disclosure
63,senortuffy,Revelation of female empowerment,7,28 March 2003,"This is a pretty good drama with an excellent cast of characters.  The story centers around Michael Douglas, who plays a division head in a high tech company in Seattle that is undergoing a merger.  Demi Moore plays his old girlfriend, an aggressive corporate executive, who comes in and snatches away the job promotion he was counting on, then failing to seduce him after hours, files a false sexual harassment with the company in order to get rid of him.It's interesting that although the story revolves around Michael Douglas's plight, it's the women who set the events in motion and who help the protagonist resolve the problem he's presented with.  Female empowerment is the main theme of this movie.Demi Moore gets perhaps her best movie role ever by playing the sexual predator to Michael Douglas's easygoing mid-level manager.  She knows how to play the corporate game much better than him, and quickly boxes him into a dicey situation.  How does a guy explain that it was his female boss who hit on him and not the other way around as she claims?   Demi Moore controls the situation well for most of the movie, and plays the villain so well that the viewer really enjoys when she finally gets her comeuppance.Roma Maffia does an excellent job of playing Michael Douglas's lawyer.  He's lost on how to respond to the sexual harassment charges and what to do to preserve his job, and she forcefully takes over his defense and steers him towards a successful resolution.  She also understands how the game is played and keeps her nerve when the company comes after her client. 
Caroline Goodall plays Michael Douglas's wife and displays a perfect combination of anger and support while he resolves the charges against him. A lawyer herself, she understands the situation her husband has gotten into much better than he does, and is there for him as both an advisor and partner.  Rosemary Forsyth plays another female executive at the company who, without giving away the plot, mentors Michael Douglas through his dilemma.  She's smart, but calm and principled, and in fact it is she, not Douglas, who eventually gets the promotion to head the company.
Even though Michael Douglas is the protagonist and eventually overcomes the crisis he's facing, his character is basically weak in the movie.  He's carefree and unfocused at the outset, assuming the job promotion is his because he's done a good job for the company, and is completely blindsided when a woman takes it away from him and then threatens his career and his marriage.  Douglas eventually takes charge and with alot of outside help and some improbable plot twists gets the upper hand, but in the cutthroat world of corporate intrigue, he's the little fish who gets lucky and swims out of the net.Donald Sutherland hands in his usual fine performance as the president of the company.  Dennis Miller plays a computer geek working for Michael Douglas and has a few humorous moments, but suddenly turns nasty in the middle of the movie and then just disappears.  Dylan Baker plays a sort of Mr. Smithers kind of character to Donald Sutherland's Monty Burns, and is just egregious enough make you hate him, which is a good sign of a performance well done.There are a few plot twists that offend the viewer's senses and things are wrapped up just a bit too neatly, but all in all, this is pretty good entertainment from start to finish.  The movie touches an important issues, sexual harassment in the workplace, and makes it more interesting by making the woman the aggressor and the man the victim.  Not surprisingly, I noticed that women gave this movie a higher average rating than did the men.",Disclosure

65,Jakemcclake,A Mystery with a Statement,8,15 October 2010,"This movie was very well filmed in the form of a mystery. It begins by raising the issue of whether men can be sexually harassed and it was advertised this way. The movie also raises the question about sex discrimination in the work place and sexual politics, which centers around a promotion.Another issue permeates the entire movie from the very start and continues right to the end, in the form of technical talk that I, like most viewers wanted to ignore. After all, there are far more important things to consider here, like whether a man can be sexually harassed and are women discriminated against in the workplace. Who wants to think about the problems with the CD Rom Disk Drives for Archamax? When the mystery is revealed in the end, we find out who really knows what is going on, it leaves the viewer with a satisfied feeling. Of course, at this point all is forgiven for one of the characters, the bad person gets their just desserts, justice is served all around, and then we hear the inspiring music and we get a chance to feel good.",Disclosure
66,gws-2,A Guilty Pleasure,8,8 July 2006,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS""Disclosure"" may well be the most politically incorrect movie ever made. Its premise is that the Michael Douglas character's new boss, Demi Moore, sexually harasses him. It was a case of woman bites dog, or something like that. The very idea must have given every feminist heartburn. Nevertheless, I though that it was a lot of fun, if not to be taken seriously. The always excellent Douglas delivered a first class performance but the real star, I thought, was the often underrated Moore. Here she plays the thoroughly evil Meredith Johnson, a Bitch Goddess from central casting. She is the type of character you love to hate and when she gets her inevitable comeuppance, you want to stand and cheer.""Disclosure"" is a Barry Levinson film and high production values abound. The photography and editing could hardly have been better and the cast is uniformly outstanding. In addition to the leads, Donald Sutherland, as the devious CEO is wonderful, as is Roma Maffia (Liz on Nip/Tuck) as the high profile lawyer who represents the Michael Douglas character. I am amazed by the generally low ratings IMDb voters have given Disclosure. For ""Disclosure"" to rate only a 5.8, a lot of the voters must have hated it. I can think of a couple of possible reasons for this phenomenon: First, as noted, the movie has a palpably anti- feminist point of view, which some would find too offensive to forgive; and second, it lacks a traditional Hollywood happy ending in that Our Hero gets passed over for a big promotion for a second time when another woman is selected to replace the now disgraced Demi Moore character as the new boss. That's too bad because ""Disclosure"" is a LOT of fun and we learn some fun stuff about the new boss as her promotion is announced. Highly recommended.",Disclosure
67,winstonfg,Fatal Attraction meets Wall Street,8,21 September 2006,"Excellent pulp-fiction fare; I wasn't surprised to find that it was based on a Micheal Crighton novel. All the major players earn their wages and the plot and dialogue are crisp, slick, and suspenseful.I think that the fascination for many men of the ""wrongfully accused harasser"" film is that these days law and society sometimes seems skewed towards women - perhaps in response to a long-standing bias in favour of men.Here we have the perpetrator, a woman, who portrays herself as victim, and uses the weight of society's (and, more importantly, the company's) censure to make Michael Douglas's life a living nightmare. The smart subtext (as with Fatal Attraction) is that MD's character is not squeaky-clean.There are slightly too many coincidences that make the nightmare for my taste; but this is film and you don't have 400 pages to tell the story. I'm an unabashed Michael Douglas fan, and Demi Moore looks good enough to eat, let alone fall by the wayside for. Dennis Miller is good as the Walter Brennan-type sidekick, updated for the 90's. Another comedian who finds acting after SNL?.Altogether a very satisfying film, in the ""Body Heat"" genre, but doesn't quite hit the heights of ""Fatal Attraction"".

69,nutsy,One of the Worst of 1994,1,19 March 2004,"1994 was a great, great year for movies. That year, audiences and movie history were blessed with the classic THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Tarantino's milestone of cinema, PULP FICTION, Stone's own landmark Tarantino adaptation, NATURAL BORN KILLERS, the much loved FORREST GUMP, and many other good movies. Then there's stuff like DISCLOSURE, no... that's unfair. Very little Hollywood fluff gets as bad as DISCLOSURE. There were other bad movies released in 1994, but they were the safe, normal bad movies we've come to expect.DISCLOSURE dares you to enter the terrifying cut-throat business world in which bad dialogue runs rampant, characters appear in cartoonish clarity or linger blurred in the background, and all dramatic points are rendered in stark black and white.If I hadn't seen a little cheapie shot-on-video horror movie called HELLSPAWN, I'd call DISCLOSURE the worst movie of its year. The packaging looked intriguing at first: we have the usually respectable Michael Douglas, the ""talented"" Demi Moore, and the once respectable Barry Levinson. Then there's that whole roles-reversed sexual-harassment thing. It sounded like a neat idea at first, but they brought it off as some cheesy thriller complete with bad suspense and a hero who is constantly accidentally implicating himself. It's like FATAL ATTRACTION plus crap.In short, it's about a guy (Douglas) being sexually harassed at the workplace by his superior, and ex-lover (Moore). Nobody believes him because guys generally like girls coming onto them  even when they're married (if the film was good it might have dispelled this sexist stereotype). The matter gets legal and things complicate.Now, we've seen hundreds of these bad thrillers, but DISCLOSURE isn't satisfied with being a regular old bad thriller. Instead, Demi Moore, Donald Sutherland, Michael Douglas, and probably the entire supporting cast are entangled in some kind of shady deal involving technology and the manufacture of microchips overseas. This wouldn't be so bad if it didn't result in supposedly important techno-babble about the technologies for which they obviously failed to consult a technical advisor. That isn't the worst of it either. The real stinker of this flick is the virtual reality scene. Michael Douglas puts on the virtual reality goggles to uncover footage exposing corporate black-ops, only to find a cheesy 2D icon of Demi Moore deleting his files with what looks like a laser-beam (Ha! Ha!). And then comes the computer-geek with angel wings and a halo, trying to warn Douglas while still in virtual reality. The scene inspires one to say out loud ""What the F***?""Meanwhile in reality, Douglas has a wife who doesn't trust him, people in his office shifting loyalties, accusations- the whole deal. None of it is interesting, and you can see the twists coming a mile around the corner. Levinson renders it all very dull, taking no steps to save the picture from its script. Levinson even fails to put the beautiful Seattle locales to the proper use. I think this one really unmasked him as a bad director (after all, how good was RAIN MAN, really?). DISCLOSURE is a bad 80s concept trying to squeeze into the newly forged 90s in all the wrong ways.
The final result is truly inexcusable. DISCLOSURE should only be watched for laughs, and even then, only out of severe boredom. For a good suspense/thriller involving a domineering woman and sex, see PLAY MISTY FOR ME. For a good 90s movie, see any of the films I named in the first paragraph. Just stay far away from DISCLOSURE!",Disclosure
70,ellenmorrison-12485,Not Very Thrilling Thriller,5,30 March 2020,"Disclosure is a film that comes so close to working several times throughout its insanely bloated runtime. A few scenes sparkle with the main set piece being, of course, the sexual harassment sequence where Demi Moore's character tries to seduce Michael Douglas' character, but the film takes a bit too long to get going and it's sure to lose a few less patient viewers along the way.You've got Douglas who works for, I guess, a software company of some sort (there's a lot of dated computer mumbo jumbo in the first 30 minutes that are a chore to sit through) and Moore plays his new boss who, it turns out, he used to date back in the day. They had a wild sex life - certainly wilder than the sex life he has with his current wife. One night, Moore invites him to stay after work and supplies him with booze to lower his inhibitions and then essentially rapes him when he tries to turn away her sexual advances. Moore becomes a woman scorned and vows to ruin Douglas' life.At this point, Disclosure kicks into high gear and becomes a somewhat enjoyable thriller for a while, dealing with Douglas' reputation at work, his suit against Moore, and how his wife handles the news. At some point, the movie flies off the rails and becomes incredibly convoluted with cyber stalking and virtual reality nonsense and that's where it lost me. It's a shame, too, because there's a germ of an interesting film in here, but its interesting 2nd act is sandwiched between two confusing and boring 1st and 3rd acts.",Disclosure

Up until now, I'd thought only men could commit rape, but this comes close to proving that wrong.

Director Barry Levinson creates a brilliant conflict, which seems to grow heavy with each scene. The entire cast is phenomenal. Moore and Douglas are perfect in their roles, but the main attraction for my eyes, was the quick, smart, catchy performance of Catherine Alvarez by Roma Maffia. Film keeps a strong interest for the whole time, only lacking in some possible slow moments. Part of why the film works so well is the fact that Levinson keeps it intellectual, dealing with adults, and the way they handle these situations. Sex is not a crutch to use for the main stars, who, at the time, were rather big. Instead, sex is portrayed as the key power in the situation. Catherine Alvarez states in the film ""Sexual harassment is not about sex, it's about power. She has it, you don't"". Pretty catchy way to portray sexual harassment.

And he thinks he has the person to make it do just that - the Demi Moore character, equallly excellent in a difficult role. Michael Douglas (excellent too)finds himself sidelined,being unaware of the bigger issues at stake. The plot becomes complicated by his being sexually harassed by Demi Moore's character - an issue which upset The Feminist Sisterhood - and possibly lost the film support from female viewers? But the plots and counter plots are clever. The end is not signalled in any obvious way and the use of the advanced computer system is absolutely central to the development of the story.

82,hoobama,solid movie,8,5 December 2001,"Never having read the book, I cannot say whether the film was adapted well from the original work. But with masterful performances by Demi Moore, Michael Douglas, and Donald Sutherland, Disclosure is a forceful depiction of the issues at the forefront of corporate America in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Add in the drama of a middle-management coup and the suspense of Douglas's character maneuvering to save his job, and the film is even stronger.In the wake of Clarence Thomas, sexual harassment policy became the hottest human resource issue in corporate America. Any discussion of it would have been easy enough to explore, but the film turns the traditional roles of a male employer harassing a female subordinate on its ear, instead having Tom Sanders (Douglas) harassed by his sexually aggressive former girlfriend, Meredith Johnson (Moore), who has recently been hired to manage Sanders' division.The film does an excellent job drawing attention to seemingly the seemingly innocent and mundane details of corporate life. The fact that Sanders pats his assistant on the behind and the cursory conversation among division heads that objectifies Meredith come back to haunt him during the mediation between the counterclaims of sexual harassment. In fact, the mediation seems to be going quite poorly for Tom Sanders, as Meredith's case that he is the sexual aggressor seems more plausible, especially when patting his assistant and the division heads conversation are brought up to establish his pattern of behavior. What ultimately redeems Tom Sanders is the discovery of a recording of the exchange between him and Meredith which reveals that he did, in fact, repeatedly say `no' to her advances. Meredith loses her composure at that point, sermonizing on her pride as a sexually aggressive woman. The upshot of the issue is summarized by Catherine Alvarez (Roma Maffia), Sanders attorney, who states, `a woman in power can be every bit as abusive as a man.'The sexual harassment subplot is done little justice by the thorough demonization of the Meredith Johnson character, which instead feeds into the larger corporate sabotage plot at the heart of the movie. With the help of an anonymous friend, some sneaking around in the corporate database to uncover the relatively exposed plot against him, and some unbelievable hours, Sanders manages not only to redeem himself, but also to shunt blame for production line problems onto Meredith. She becomes the scapegoat for the plot against him, and he is vindicated in both her firing and the public proof of his competence.Beyond the plot issues, the film does an excellent job characterizing the environment of a small, but able hardware production company in the early 1990s, before the Internet economy had grown from its nascence. Digicom, the fledgling company for which our protagonist works, is on the cusp of a merger that would net the company upwards of $100 million, and the tenuousness of the wealth about to pour in palpably increases the tension level throughout the company. Everyone in the company has a clear interest in quashing any controversy that could endanger the deal, which gives virtually everyone incentive to side against Sanders, since Meredith's claim is the more acceptable of the two. The result is the sense that as the ranks tighten under duress, so too does the willingness for open discourse and fairness in the corporate environment. It is far more important to keep the skeletons locked securely in the closet than to seek truth, and ultimately, fairness.The company's blunder is in jeopardizing Sanders' stake in the merger. Threatened with a move to Austin and no piece of the wealth about to roll in, he has no recourse but to fight tooth-and-nail to restore his job security. Of course, the implications on his future employment at Digicom are dubious, but when his anonymous benefactor turns out to be appointed as Meredith's replacement, right is restored, and everyone can live happily ever after.The acting performances turned in by Douglas and Moore are superb - Douglas masterfully conveys the mixture easy senselessness and self-importance of a moderately successful, white, male middle manager. He is appropriately embroiled in the particular problems of doing his job until his identity in that job is threatened by accusations of sexual harassment and incompetence. As the plots mount against him, his focus shifts to maintaining his reputation and his livelihood, and his ultimate redemption is complete except for the obvious questions about his future at the company.Moore's Meredith Johnson is a woman with a too sinister corporate savvy, the archetype of the conniving female executive who uses every device at her disposal to achieve her ultimate goal of corporate domination. Her vitriol in the mediation scene is reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, and the writing of the character as totally amoral diminishes little from her portrayal.These two in particular are slightly disingenuous at times in the more corporate scenes in the movie, as if they are unaccustomed to the numbness with which most corporate citizens accept and recite business jargon. Donald Sutherland, on the other hand, is astoundingly strong in his portrayal of a chief executive, and the overall digital corporation setting is very well done, and very well supported by the players.It's clearly not the best film ever made, but it is a very decent choice for a suspense-drama rental on a slow Saturday night.",Disclosure
83,capie4,Missed one important point that ruined the movie for me,4,11 June 2011,"I a twenty-year-old in the early '80's--and male, AND in the military, I suffered as much as any male in the corporate World regarding the sexism's against the male, the racism against the White, and especially the White-male. It was ""open season"" on especially White males who were especially disregarded in both being a victim and defense of sexual harassment and racism. This was due to the definition of sexual harassment which, unofficially, was defined as ""thinking from behind your zipper---a definition (cleaned up a bit) common to men, for the purpose to ""gain power over a person."" At that time, changed since thanks to ""Sex in the City"", women were still seen as sluts and not sexually aggressive. Women, the whole time, were free to practice sexual harassment and discrimination (then called, ""get even-ism"") which developed as a practice of oversensitivity. The power for which women did (and do) as they practiced sexism was not thinking out of their zipper, but using oversensitivity to the defined sexism (which is sexist in its nature)as a tool to gain power over their environment. In short, women do not practice sexism to gain power over a person, but of an environment (which includes people--male and female). They will use oversensitivity to garner a complaint against a male competitor for a promotion, and the male had no defense as it was open season on him.This movie (book too?) had Demi Moore's character practicing sexism to gain power over a male competitor to gain power over him by actually using sex. This is not consistent with how women sexually harass. The writers had her using her vagina to gain power over a male, (not unbelievable today, thanks again, to the aforementioned Sex in the City) instead of practicing (and exposing to the public) the way a woman harasses and discriminates.Had she gone through the movie accusing every male of impropriety's, she would have been a normal ""femi-nazi"" sexist-believable and bared to the movie-going public--and exposing women's sexism (which is *still* not today in 2011) to the mainstream and opening doors for women to be included in the sexual harassment policies.As it stands, this movie does what corporations have done since the 1972 equal rights laws have been doing---leaving women out of guilt, and men being the target.This is what this movie fails to recognize.Demi Moore's character is sexually aggressive to gain power over a person--and not there environment.",Disclosure
84,Jagged-11,"Entertaining Junk (WARNING,POSSIBLE SPOILERS)",7,13 July 2003,"Disclosure is a silly but intriguing thriller, which would have been much better had the screen-writer chosen to concentrate on the sexual harrassment plot thread as opposed to the confusing computer conspiracy mumbo jumbo.The plot of Disclosure revolves around Tom Sanders(Michael Douglas) a fairly stereotypical buisness man, with a high paying job, a loving wife and two children. However on the day he is expecting a promotion he finds that the prestigious position has been given to a woman named Meredith Johnson(Demi Moore) an old flame of his and he begins to suspect his career may be in jeapordy.For this reason he later goes to her office for a buisness discussion, but finds she is more interested in rekindling their romance and after much groping, groaning and close-ups of Demi Moore's wonder bra (but no Sex)he flounces out of her office, declaring he is happily married and has no interest in beginning an affair. Meredith does not respond well to this and the following day Tom finds himself accused of sexually harrassing her, but mores is at stake than he imagines.Sadly the film fails to concentrate on this theme as swiftly the film plummets into conspiracies, double-crosses, all to do with computer products and software, none of which makes much sense and seems have no other purpose than as a cheap plot device to enable Tom to humiliate Meredith at the end of the film.Still the film is worth viewing, it is competently directed by Barry Levinson, and has a superb music score by Ennio Morricone and the entire office structure which Tom works in is stylishly designed and the film is well paced (even though it is implausible in numerous places) and holds your attention throughout.The acting is solid, Michael Douglas performs well enough in a rather bland role whilst Demi Moore gloriously vamps it up as the schemeing Meredith. There's good support from Donald Sutherland as Tom's unsmypathetic boss and Roma Maffia turns in a great performance as Tom's tough-talking lawyer.All in all a good film that could have benefited from some script moderations, but I'll give it a reasnobly good score of 7 out of 10",Disclosure
