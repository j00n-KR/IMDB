0,Leofwine_draca,"Better than the first, but not great",5,22 September 2017,"Hit-man: Agent 47 is a follow-up to the 2007 dud and thankfully an improved production, although still only average overall. The plot features a young woman with special powers who is being pursued by assassins and a sinister organisation with plans to create an army of super soldiers. Rupert Friend takes on the lead role, replacing Timothy Olyphant in the original, and the good news is that he's a far better fit and a better actor to boot. The rest of the film is dominated with action sequences - reminiscent of JOHN WICK at times, with the director of that film handling the choreography, although not on the same level - and lots of meagre CGI effects which look like they were created on the cheap. It's a passable piece of entertainment, and anything with Ciaran Hinds in it has to be worth a look in my mind, but it's also completely forgettable.",Hitman - Agent 47
1,SnoopyStyle,lifeless charisma-free characters,4,12 September 2016,Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) is a genetically engineered assassin created by Doctor Petr Litvenko (Ciarán Hinds). Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware) is stressed by her super awareness. She is looking for her father and is approached by John Smith (Zachary Quinto) who offers to protect her. Agent 47 is coming after her but not necessarily for the expected.The twist is cool but nothing else is. The play on name is a fun little reveal. The characters are charisma-free. Agent 47 has never seems to be lead character material. Katia could be the lead but Hannah Ware doesn't have it. She is absolutely stunning but there is a lack of power. The action is mostly chaos with a few cool moments. This is not a compelling movie.,Hitman - Agent 47
2,Prismark10,The hit-man and her,4,11 November 2015,"Rupert Friend has replaced Timothy Olyphant as the bar coded assassin in the rebooted sequel Agent 47.The Hit-man returns and is on the hunt for Katia van Dees, daughter of missing scientist Dr Litvenko who created the genetically engineered assassins several decades ago. Agent 47 is not the only person wanting to get hold of Katia. Their is a shadowy syndicate after her and everyone thinks she will lead them to her missing father. The syndicate want Dr Litvenko to produce more super- soldiers.Katia herself seems to have abilities to sense danger and when danger does arrive only Zachary Quinto's mysterious John Smith is willing to help her out.Right from the start we have a high octane action and body count as Agent 47 kills people in all manner of novel ways while he goes after Katia. John Smith really does well to go toe to toe with him.It does not matter if you have never played the video games, the plot is just an excuse for action, killing and car chases with characters who stand still long enough for plot exposition and it has more holes than Swiss cheese.There is some nice bit of location shooting in Germany and Singapore. It really is a film to disengage the brain and watch some action and adventure for 90 minutes. In that sense it is an unpretentious fun film. I think Olyphant would had been better if he reprised the role though.",Hitman - Agent 47
3,nogodnomasters,You missed,7,17 April 2018,"The film is based on a video game which I never played. The plot, which was basically explained in the first 10 minutes, I found a bit confusing. There is a group of people who want to genetically engineer an army of elite sociopath killers. They run into problems and want the doctor (Ciarán Hinds) who had once created such people back in August or 1967. They are able to identify his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) through world wide facial recognition software. John Smith (Zachary Quinto) is tasked from the agency to find the daughter, now in Berlin. Meanwhile Agent 47, an old school genetically engineered assassin, is tasked with...well what assassins do.It seems, like a video game, the plot is immaterial, we just want to see shoot 'em up action, with impossible scenes, with the bad guys driving Jaguars...or in this case Audi's. Try not to follow the plot, just wait for the action scenes. And yes Mr. Spock has a few surprises too to even the odds.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",Hitman - Agent 47
4,kosmasp,Hit-man strikes (but not out),7,6 September 2016,"While the original Hit-man adaptation was not as bad as the Max Payne adaptation, it still seemed to lack some of the stylish choices of the game. If you have played the games, than a lot of shots that are used in the movie here will seem familiar. I'm a bit shocked that another reviewer didn't like the amount of shots the ""reloading"" of the guns got in this. If that bothers you, than any action movie will seem ""bad"" in the sense that there is more shooting than reloading.Same is true here, but the main actor seems to capture the essence of the game character. I'm not saying it's a perfect movie of course (see rating), but it does a really good job and does not take anything for granted. Trying to please fans of the game and action fans at the same time is not the easiest thing to do. But going for an ""R"" instead of making this a family friendly affair (Hitman just isn't that) shows the amount of respect for the source the filmmakers brought to the table.So if you're looking for a decent action movie or you actually enjoy the games, this probably will please you (except for the mentioned reloading sequences of course :p )",Hitman - Agent 47
5,classicsoncall,"""We determine who we are by what we do.""",6,30 December 2019,"There seems to be a disconnect between the creation of the first super-human elite assassin, and the nearly five decade interval that a clandestine group calling itself the Syndicate International wants to get back in the game to create an army of them. What took them so long? And in the meantime, Dr. Peter Aaron Litvenko (Ciarán Hinds) had already come up with a far advanced and superior Agent 90 in the guise of his daughter Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware), who by the way, and it didn't strike me until just now, doesn't have the same last name as her father Litvenko. All that probably won't matter to action fans who go for this kind of stuff, but it does sort of bring down the credibility of the story. With a few minor twists, it's a passable flick if you put your brain on hold, as the principals perform their roles well enough without actually being likeable characters. It wasn't explained very well how Syndicate agent John Smith (Zachary Quinto) came back from the dead, since these 'super agents' were still flesh and blood people after all, and the punishment and damage they suffered didn't jive with reality. In fact, the entire time I'm watching the movie I'm thinking Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) as more of a robot or android than an actual human being. Which becomes even more than credible when a second Agent looking just like him shows up at the end of the picture. Don't even try to explain that one.",Hitman - Agent 47
6,jboothmillard,Hitman: Agent 47,3,1 August 2021,"I saw the original Hitman a few years ago, based on the popular video game franchise, and it wasn't very good, and I didn't have my hopes much higher for this reboot. Basically, 47 (Rupert Friend) is an ""Agent"", a genetically enhanced super soldier built to be an emotionless and ruthless assassin. The Agent Program was created by Dr. Petr Litvenko (Ciarán Hinds), a skilled Ukrainian geneticist, but the project was abandoned due to its controversy. 47 now works as a hitman for the ICA (International Contracts Agency). Meanwhile, mercenaries led by Delriego (Rolf Kanies) are searching for Litvenko to reactivate the Agent program for their own means, to create an army of super soldiers. 47 has spent the last few years tracking down Litvenko's daughter Katia, and eventually he gets a lead. Katia (Hannah Ware) is living in Berlin, under a different name, she has been searching for an unknown man, and is confused by her experiences overwhelming anxiety and a superhuman awareness. A man calling himself John Smith (Zachary Quinto) approaches her at a subway station to tell her that 47 is on his way to kill her. Smith offers to protect her, while hinting that he has information about the man she is searching for. 47 finds and attacks the pair, but they manage to escape, and hide out in a hotel. Smith explains that he is an operative for a corporation called Syndicate International and that the man she is searching for is her father. Katia shows him the clues she has put together and asks John to tell her everything he knows about her father, who she deduces must be living. Before she can tell Smith what she knows, 47 enters, killing Smith and capturing her. When Katia wakes from unconsciousness, 47 explains to her that she is an Agent, designed by her father to be better than even 47 himself. He shows her how to use her heightened senses in combat and the two fight against Syndicate forces. They are confronted by Smith, who is revealed to have surgically implanted subdermal body armour, making him impervious to gunshots. After fighting off Smith, 47 and Katia manage to escape. Katia makes 47 promise that he will not harm her father and finally reveals Litvenko is in Singapore. Elsewhere, 47's handler Diana (Angelababy), learning about the situation, contacts another Agent in Singapore. 47 and Katia track down Litvenko, who apologises to his daughter for abandoning her, saying that he only wanted to keep her safe. Just then, Syndicate soldiers attack the group, and they are forced to flee. While escaping, Litvenko is captured by the Syndicate, but not before 47 gives him an inhaler. Smith tortures Litvenko, while Syndicate director Antoine Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) supervises, but Litvenko refuses to reopen the Agent program. 47 hacks into the Syndicate system and Katia crashes a stolen helicopter into the building; 47 disguises himself as a firefighter to enter undetected. The two fight their way through Syndicate security forces, and 47 is once again confronted by Smith. 47 defeats him by electrocuting him. On the rooftop, 47 and Katia defeat the rest of the Syndicate's troops, while Le Clerq escapes in a helicopter with Litvenko. In mid-air, Litvenko detonates the inhaler, a bomb, killing himself and the director. 47 then calls Diana to confirm Le Clerq, his first target, has been eliminated, but refuses to confirm his second target, implied to be Katia, is also dead, dropping the phone from the side of the building. As the two prepare to leave, they are confronted by Agent 48, an exact look-alike of Agent 47, who fires at them before the screen goes black. During the credits, the electrocuted body of Smith is seen to wake up. Also starring Dan Bakkedahl as Sanders, Emilio Rivera as Fabian, and Jürgen Prochnow as Tobias. Bald-headed Friend is blank and bland as the leading anti-hero, Ware is okay as the young woman discovering her own modified abilities, and Quinto is suitably menacing as the villain. The ""who can you trust?"" format has its moments, and there are a couple of chases, explosions and guns blazing that get your attention. But the over-the-top and often ridiculous stunts and sequences, and a predictable and dull story make this a near forgettable experience, easily worse than the predecessor and another video game adaptation fail, a pointless action thriller. Adequate!",Hitman - Agent 47
7,paul_haakonsen,An explosive action movie from start to end...,8,11 November 2016,"I enjoyed the games back in the day, and I also enjoyed the first ""Hitman"" movie from 2007. I was aware of this movie, but never really got around to watch it before I happened to come across it by sheer luck and then took the time to watch it.And I was blown away. I had really been missing out on an action movie of high caliber here. ""Hitman: Agent 47"" kicks up into high gear from the very beginning and it doesn't slow down.The story was good, albeit it is quite simplistic. Agent 47 teams up with a woman to find her father and thus finding out about her story and background.""Hitman: Agent 47"" just pounds you with everything it got, and it is a thrill to sit through it all. Especially because director Aleksander Bach really punched the movie into explosive gear and just kept assaulting the audience with one impressive scene after another.There is so much action in this movie, that even us who grew up with the movies of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Van Damme, and the likes can't help to be impressed. I was blown away by the overload of action and adrenaline that this movie has. And it was all choreographed so nicely and equally so executed on the screen. It was a pure pleasure to sit through this explosive movie.At first I was a bit hesitant about how Rupert Friend would handle the role of Agent 47. But he put my hesitation to shame early on in the movie. He was so right for this role and he was an excellent choice for Agent 47. I dare actually say that he played the part much better than Timothy Olyphant did back in 2007.""Hitman: Agent 47"" really took me by surprise, and this is definitely a movie that you can watch more than once. If you enjoy action movies and haven't gotten around to watching ""Hitman: Agent 47"" yet, I can only encourage you to get around to doing it, because you are really missing out on an explosive movie.",Hitman - Agent 47

9,CinemaSerf,A sequel nobody needed...,5,12 October 2021,"Anyone who has followed the career of Rupert Friend - either before, or since this film, would probably have to agree that though handsome (especially in ""The Last Legion"" (2007)) he simply is not lead actor material. Here is certainly no exception as he dons the guise of a ruthless assassin on the trail of Hannah Ware's ""Katia van Dees"". Question is - why? After a near miss, she is offered some safety from ""John Smith"" (Zachary Quinto) but we are soon uncertain as to which man is really the threat and of how she fits into the plans of the scientists who want to genetically engineer an army of killers. To give it it's due - there is action a-plenty; loads of pyrotechnics and shoot 'em ups as we roll, relentlessly - if completely pointlessly - towards an ending that also demonstrates some limitations in the acting skills of Ciarán Hinds too. A few recognisable faces pop up - Thomas Kretschmann and Jürgen Prochnow, but neither add much to the thinnest of plots and I'm afraid this is just a film that ought to have remained as a piece of console entertainment.",Hitman - Agent 47
10,zardoz-13,Fantastic From Fade-In to Fade-Out!!!,10,6 September 2015,"No, I've never played any of the many versions of the ""Hitman"" video games that either Eidos Interactive or Eidos Interactive or Square Enix have marketed since 2000. The first cinematic adaptation of the stealth video game series about a genetically-engineered, skin-headed assassin with a bar code stamped on the back of his head and designated as Agent 47 appeared in 2007 with ""Justified"" star Timothy Olyphant. Sources indicate that the $25-million budgeted actioneer raked in about $150-million at the box office. Mind you, Hollywood has produced sequels from less successful originals so it seems mysterious that Twentieth Century Fox has stalled a sequel for so long. Actually, I thought director Xavier Gens's fast-paced but formulaic ""Hitman"" qualified as bottom-of-the-barrel abysmal. Despite its strong cast and slick production values, the unrated DVD/Blu-ray ""Hitman"" release has done nothing to alter my sentiments. Consequently, I approached director Aleksander Bach's sequel ""Hitman: Agent 47"" with dread. Reportedly, ""Fast and Furious"" star Paul Walker had been attached to star in this shoot'em up saga before he died in a fiery car crash. British thespian Rupert Friend of ""Homeland"" fame takes over the role from Timothy Olyphant. Friend adopts the skin-head look and delivers a performance every bit as imperturbable as Olyphant. Surprisingly enough, however, ""Hitman: Agent 47"" turned out a 100 times better than its lackluster predecessor. As far as pistol-packing suspense thrillers go, ""Hitman: Agent 47"" (**** OUT OF ****) ranks as one of the preeminent summer actioneers. I found myself entirely caught off guard by this sensational shoot'em up. Stunning Berlin and Singapore scenery, spontaneous combat sequences, a double-digit body count, and story surprises galore distinguish this lean, mean, 97 minute, R-rated, bullet-riddled bloodbath about a daughter searching for her long-lost father. Granted, movies about cloned, super-assassins have become a dime-a-dozen, but ""Hitman: Agent 47"" looms above all others with its imaginative Skip Woods and Michael Finch script and Bach's ambitiously, outlandish showdowns. If you love stimulating action movies, you'll appreciate this gripping movie that co-stars Ciarán Hinds, Thomas Kretschmann, Zachary Quinto, and Jürgen Prochnow.",Hitman - Agent 47
11,oscaralbert,Beware of driving or getting near an Audi car . . .,7,30 January 2016,". . . H!TMAN: AGENT 47 shouts at us in a not altogether subtle fashion. Audis are shown to be explosion-prone, and quite difficult to maneuver even a few city blocks without winding up totaled. If any automobile insurance executives see H!TMAN, it's doubtful that policies will even be issued covering Audis in coming months. Audis apparently emanate from one of those European countries with the hubris to ""pride (itself) on its (automotive) engineering."" Though the Hows and Whys of the Audi combustion problems may not be fully explored in H!TMAN, it's pretty hard not to second guess their design, particularly their wiring. At least no one is priding themselves on Audi styling to my knowledge, as these sedans look pretty much like any other brand of car (that is, until they go, ""KA-BOOM!!""). Auto aficionados will tell you that makes looked different from each other through the 1960s, and it's been all downhill after that. At any rate, H!TMAN makes it easy to remember that four interlocked rings in one row are a dead giveaway warning that an Audi is present (just think Berlin's Olympic Stadium Rings of 1936, after the Russian tanks steamrolled and partially crushed them at the end of World War Two).",Hitman - Agent 47
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Hits the mark,8,27 August 2015,"An assassin teams up with a woman to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry. ...no, really, that's it. Well, there are twists, and it doesn't do everything you think it might. But much like the IOI games, this has little plot, focusing instead on extensive backstory. And at least it isn't the overly complicated mess of the '07 film, which this handily beats in all respects, keeping a few elements from it.This has a surprising amount of character moments. Interactions and when they're alone. 47(Friend, detached from what he does feel, in control of the situation and not shy about it. He pulls off the baldness without it looking chemo and his face is ""plain"", not Hollywood, so he could disappear into a crowd. Or could, if he had hair), is entirely by himself. By necessity. And desire? Katia(Ware, keeping her distance, owning her anxiety and using what it to comes from to her advantage) may have been abandoned, and is driven to find out why, yet is a strong, independent woman. They compliment each other, rather than her being towed along. The others, I shouldn't give away. The genetic tampering allows bringing up the old determinism vs. free will debate, and the ethics of the practice itself. Is this too dumb to take those on? Otherwise, yes. And it owns it.The action is elegant, choreographed, often OTT and ridiculous. A stronger, faster and smarter human, trained from childhood to kill, creatively taking on dozens of literally faceless goons? That is exactly the direction to go with it! She has incredible memory, instincts, intuition and senses. He's in his red tie, black suit, white shirt, and uses his R93 Blaser sniper, his dual silver .45s, his knives, melee and tactics. And it is glorious. The first third of this feels like The Terminator, with our titular hero as the T800! This is stylish, slick and badass.There is a ton of bloody, violent and disturbing content, a little gore and strong language. I recommend this to anyone who wants to turn their brain off, and I mean, fully off, and enjoy themselves. Fan or not of the decade and a half old franchise? You'll grin through it either way. Doesn't matter whether you know the material, or not even like it. 8/10",Hitman - Agent 47
13,view_and_review,It Was A Video Game,5,30 January 2016,"Action movies have evolved into an artistic expression of killing. Except that the art is that of a five year old's finger painting. Efficiently kill when it is necessary and choose the most far-fetched elaborate means of killing when efficiency is too boring. What we get is a flimsy plot, putrid dialog, and contrived excuses for showing us the latest trick someone learned with his CGI program. An orgy of explosions, gunfire, car chases and choreographed fight scenes. Occasionally there will be some nudity but ""Hitman: Agent 47"" opted not to be so cliché.Judging by what I've said so far you'd think I hate action flicks. Not so. I loved the Terminators, Die Hards, Predator, and.... There I go dating myself. It's just that as much as CGI has added to film making it has hurt almost equally as much. I know that there is some suspended disbelief in action films but how much of my brain do you want me to switch off? So the question remains: where do we go from here? There are only so many laws of physics we can break. Come on, we have to be believable.",Hitman - Agent 47
14,neil-476,Did I care? I did not.,6,4 September 2015,"The survivor of a programme to produce genetically enhanced soldiers/assassins is tasked with eliminating the two remaining individuals who could re-start the programme. Or maybe he is working for the other side, who knows? This action thriller seeks to reboot the franchise, if that's the right expression given that there was only one film, based on the video game Hit-man. Plotwise, this is fine. Actionwise, this is fine. Visualwise, this is fine. The problem is that the two leads – Rupert Friend as Agent 47 and Hannah Ware as Katia – don't have more than a teaspoon of charisma between them. You don't care in the slightest what happens to them (and, yes, I know that Agent 47 is supposed to be emotionless and implacable, but contrast Timothy Olyphant in the previous pass at this: not a great film, but Olyphant commanded the screen.This film passes the time well enough as moving wallpaper but, due to not identifying with the main characters, there is no emotional engagement whatsoever. As a consequence of not caring about the protagonists, you don't care about anything and, accordingly, this film might just as well have not have bothered with casting people.

Known only as Agent 47, his target is a corporation that plans to unlock the secret of his past to create an army of killers even more powerful than him. With help from a young woman, the titular assassin confronts revelations about his own origins in an epic battle with his deadliest foe.....I was always curious as to why 20th Century Fox would try to reboot one of the most inane, boring, movies based on a video game ever made. The original Hit-man had absolutely nothing going for it, and Olyphant, as good an actor as he is, was a poor choice for 47.And now it appears that history has repeated itself. Here, Rupert Friend is this movies poor choice for the title role (Friend is a wonderful actor), but this time it's become pretty clear as to why films based on this particular game will never work, Agent 47 literally has nothing about him, no personality, and the fact the film hardly touches his origin just makes the film that little more incoherent.So the film consists of above average set piece, inane boring exposition for twenty minutes, above average set piece....etc, until the delusional promise of a continuation to the film at the end.Quinto turns up early in the film, and brings a little life for a while, but then there is a revelation about his character later on, and then he becomes as autonomous as our favourite numerical based agent.It's a step up from the 2007 travesty, but that's like saying breaking a toe isn't as bad as breaking a finger.It looks good, there are a few inventive action sequences, but really, there was no need to make this......which makes me very concerned for Hollywood and its lack of ideas.I have lots of ideas for movies, really good concepts too.

16,phd_travel,A lot of action but the story is bad,3,20 August 2015,"The story is bad and confusing. A girl is suddenly looking for her father. A stone cold killer isn't far behind. Or is he? It would have been better if they explained things from the start instead of the bad guy to good guy switch half way. The shooting and fighting is moderately diverting, and the car chase a bit generic with too much focus on the Audi logo. The powers aren't that unique. The action moves from Berlin to Singapore with some modern buildings but that doesn't make up for the bad story. Some of the fighting is boring.Rupert Friend minus hair is a suitably stone cold looking Agent 47. Hannah Ware as the lead actress isn't quite attractive or interesting enough.

17,gradyharp,'We determine who we are by what we do.',6,31 December 2015,"When will the fascination and obsession with killing stop? It is in the television series, games children play, and movies. Assassins and hit men/women are the toast of the town, and if that is you cup of tea you will love this movie.Written by Skip Woods and Michael Finch, Hit-man: AGENT 47 as directed by Alexsander Bach centers on an elite assassin (Rupert Friend) who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck. He is the culmination of decades of research and forty-six earlier Agent clones -- endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega- corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47's past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman Katia (Hannah Ware) who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe (Zachary Quinto) in an attempt to find Katia's father (Ciarán Hinds). Rupert Friend, still appealing as a leading man with a shaved head, fills the role well and the cinematography of all the impossible special effects is impressive.

Playing a game or watching a movie is a complete different entertainment. A movie is relaxing while a game might be more stressful. Hit-man agent 47 is just plain action for 90 minutes. If you don't like that kind of movies then just don't watch this one because that is what you are going to get. To me it's better then James Bond movies because here the hero at least bleeds and gets hurt sometimes while in OO7 movies that seems impossible. The action scenes were good, the script is just okay but then again I didn't except much on that part. The actors were all good to me, and that's what it is all about.",Hitman - Agent 47

It is an Apple-style, gun kata, Matrix derived, James Bond cloning, CGI filled, Resident Evil sequel.I wanted to watch it because I like Rupert Friend in Homeland. He did not disappoint, but neither did he blow my mind. It is clear that he needs better direction than the one time director Aleksander Bach could provide. Zachary Quinto does a decent job as well, considering the script. Hannah Ware is... cute and has a British accent. That's about it.I could waste time telling you about the story, but it is rather silly and obvious. Even the twists, you see them coming from miles away.

20,KineticSeoul,"Not really worth a rental, but it wouldn't be a awful rental",4,23 December 2015,"Although it ain't saying much but the 2007 version is better than this one. And it's not only because you get to see Olga Kurylenko topless either. It seemed like they actually put some effort into the 2007 version of ""Hitman"" the movie. This one just seemed like a cheap attempt. Just about every potential in this movie is wasted, such as Zachary Quinto. The whole thing suffers from Paul W. S. Anderson's direction when it comes to video game to movie form. Except it doesn't stray that far from the source material. Audiences that doesn't know about ""Hitman"" video games will find this movie odd for negative reasons. And the gamers that know about this video game franchise will be left disappointed. Because the actor that plays Agent 47 does not resemble 47 besides the shaved head. And the way Agent 47 does things in the video game is very very different. Kind of like how Paul W. S. Anderson took a survival horror game into a straight up kung-fu action movie with bullet time and people pulling off ""The Matrix"" maneuvers. Watching this was like watching a crappy version of ""The Terminator"". On a positive note, maybe it's because this movie is just 1 hour and 30 minutes but the characters weren't really annoying but they are still easily forgettable. The hand to hand fight choreography was choppy but alright as well. However I was just checking my watch throughout this whole mess of a film, even though I try to give it a shot and see the positive aspects of it. I have just seen way way better action movies over this one. The whole premise and direction is lame and for a movie that actually made it to theaters, the CGI in this is really bad.

This installment has the killer-for-hire teaming up with a woman; to stop an evil organization, from copying the bioengineering program that created him. Both films are loosely based on the popular 'Hitman' video game series (which began in 2000). This new chapter was directed by first time filmmmaker Aleksander Bach and written by Michael Finch and Skip Woods (who also wrote the original). It stars Rupert Friend as '47' (replacing Timothy Olyphant from the first movie) and it costars Hannah Ware, Zachary Quinto, Ciaran Hinds and Thomas Kretschmann. I'm not a big fan of the first movie, and this is certainly no improvement. Genetically engineered hit-man-for-hire Agent 47 (Friend) has just been given a new assignment; to stop a powerful corporation from replicating the scientific project that created him. The evil company, known as Syndicate International, plans to create their own army of assassins; with skills even deadlier than 47's. In order to do this, the Syndicate must get their hands on the lead scientist, responsible for creating the elite agents; his name is Dr. Peter Litvenko (Hinds). 47 teams with Litvenko's daughter (Ware), in order to protect him.The movie has some cool video game style action scenes, but that's about all it has; and that's just what watching the movie feels like, playing a shoot' em up video game (and I've heard these films are almost nothing like the stealth games they're based on). The characters are pretty boring, and underdeveloped, and the acting is all pretty stiff (even Quinto, who I expect a lot more from). The plot is just as boring, and stupid, as well. I do like the look of the film though, and Friend at least looks like a cool action hero (kind of like a Terminator, in a lot of scenes). It's not a complete waste of time, if you like mindless action movies, but it's close.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/iHtyjLDJ1Ko",Hitman - Agent 47

SPOILERS
the scene near the end where he sees an enemy pick up a gun to point at his girl, he decides that the best course of action is to stand in front of her and get shot. rather then the much quicker and logical task of shooting the bad guy , which he has been shown to be able to do with ridiculous accuracy. for a second I thought maybe he was out of ammo. But immediately after he turns around and shoots the guy. Prototypical OMG moment",Hitman - Agent 47
23,Robert_duder,Basically the same attempt all over again,6,26 August 2015,"Now I admit I had high hopes for this film from the trailer. It looked like a balls to the wall action flick that didn't hold anything back. I am a huge fan of this video game series but I did not want that to effect my opinion of this movie. They should be considered separate entities. You can pay homage and create a movie based on a video game without it being a copy. The first attempt at a Hit-man movie was met with mixed emotions. I thought it was decent and a good start but the trailer for this film was done very well. It reeked of blood and guts and fast paced action and I was psyched. I think those expectations got ahead of me because it really didn't live up to the own hype I've made. Hit-man: Agent 47 has some very intensely choreographed fight scenes right up there with a Luc Besson film but parts of the story that lay the groundwork for the plot really drags and the pace of the movie is thrown off from action film to something else. Much like the first Hit-man movie, the plot for this film seems more complex than what it should be. Its not hard to follow but there just seems to be so much to it. The one thing this film does better than the first is the representation of Agent 47 himself was much better and closer to the game.Rupert Friend, best known from Homeland, takes on the role of Agent 47. He is much more emotionless than Timothy Olyphant was and he plays the deadly killer a little more closer to the video game. There is no romantic angle which is a very good thing and using the disguises was a great addition to the plot as well. Friend could definitely continue this character very well. Even if the movie wasn't great, Friend may find himself some big roles from this. Hannah Ware is also very good as Katia, the mysterious girl that the Syndicate and 47 want. Ware actually is the perfect balance to 47's serious, emotionless character. Ware also kicks some serious butt and holds her own making her a great hero as well. Zachary Quinto made for a decent villain and he also holds his own against Friend's 47. I sort of expected something a little darker and more evil than what Quinto gives us but its a different role for him and he's good in it. Both Thomas Kretschmann and Rolf Kanies should have bigger roles and its hard to say they do good or bad because their roles are so small and yet significant. I would have also liked to have seen far more from the character ""Diana"" played by Angelababy but she is reduced to hardly more than a cameo.Once again just like 2007's entry we have a director with literally no experience. This is all Aleksander Bach has and while I will give him points for style, a lack of experience almost always shows in film unless they have a real splash of hidden talent. Bach has good style and there are some really unique shot scenes and he uses colour and stark contrasts to create a unique look and I like that and I respect him for it but the story and pace lacks what it should. This should have felt more like The Transporter and less like Mission Impossible although both those movies are great, a movie based on a video game of Hit-man does not need and should not have such an in depth story. The writers are all good writers who have worked on some great action movies so I can only assume that editing and directing is to blame for this being distinctly lacklustre. It just doesn't hold up to what should be and in my opinion doesn't even end up being quite as good as the last go around. Check it out but have very modest expectations and enjoy the crazy action scenes. 6.5/10",Hitman - Agent 47
24,A_Different_Drummer,panache and elan,8,31 October 2015,"What's with the haters? Were you expecting Lord of the Rings? As luck would have it, I caught this film just after revisiting Guy Ritchie's lamentable MAN FROM UNCLE.As I watched Hit-man 47 I could not help but notice that every single goal that Ritchie had failed at in UNCLE, Bach nailed here.The story was fast-paced. full of clever tropes. the characters were engaging and the cinematography was breath-taking.I can understand perhaps why reviewers comparing it to the original might get frustrated -- Olyphant is such a strong presence that he commands the screen where here Bach had to work harder and better to hold attention. And he does.Quinto is solid but I am concerned at the arc his career is taking. In HEROES, he was mesmerizing. In Star Trek, he nailed young Spock. Here he is merely solid and competent.Would recommend.",Hitman - Agent 47
25,CuriosityKilledShawn,Missing an S off the front,3,25 May 2019,"Two strikes and out for Agent 47. They tried to make it a thing in 2007 with Timothy Olyphant but I honestly cannot remember a thing about it. Eight years later they tried to reboot it and did slightly better, but I'm not holding my breath that Fox will ever make a decent movie out this popular video game series. I quite enjoy the Hitman games and there's a stripped-down purity to the story, so why are the movies so over-plotted and stupid?Perhaps because Skip Woods (the worst writer in Hollywood) has been hired to pen the script for both of them. Why do this? Did Fox really look at his used toilet paper screenplay for Die Hard 5 and say ""yeah, this is a guy we want to continually employ""? It boggles the mind. There has been much debate over whether Skip Woods is actually a real person and not just a name that writers use when they are embarrassed to be associated with a movie. Sadly, he does exist and all of his work really is that bad.Is the plot really even worth reciting? I'll do my best, as I was a little drunk watching this (the only way to remotely enjoy it). Agent 47 is out to kill/protect a girl who's father started ""the program"" and now they want to start it back up again and make better hitmen but she's in hiding so she must be found and...blah...blah...blah. Lots of people shot, dozens of lackeys willing to give up their lives for a soulless organization that clearly doesn't value them. One wonders what the job advert description would read for these unfortunate men.The action scenes are okay, there is some nice photography of European locations, and Rupert Friend embodies role much better than Olyphant-man did in 2007. The support from his leading lady was pretty bad. I hated her character and I don't want to see her in any other movies. The music, by Marco Beltrami, is, as expected, completely forgettable. He's certainly on the lower rungs of Hollywood composers who constantly get work despite more talented people ready and able to do better. Director Aleksander Bach literally has no other work on his resume (Hitman is his only film) but doesn't seem to be much of a fan of the games, where you can off the targets with a zillion different methods. Here, Agent 47 just shoots everyone. There's no stealth whatsoever, despite that being the main suspenseful drive of the game.Not terrible, but not a movie I'll ever be in a rush to watch again.",Hitman - Agent 47

The genetically engineered assassin program has resulted in perfect killing machines. Agent 47 (Friend) is the most advanced result but someone wants to improve upon him. His mission is to stop anyone from finding the formula, at any cost. I have to start by saying I was not a fan of the original Hit-man movie and was a little hesitant about watching this one. I will admit that this one was better then the old one. On the other hand the story wasn't all that exciting and when the action wasn't happening it started to drag a little. The action was really exciting and inventive in some areas and the movie is worth watching for that but it just needed less time in between the excitement to keep it moving. Overall, better then the first one but still doesn't hit the same excitement as the video game series does.

It is not involving, not impressive, not interesting and many things more of ""not"". For what it is, it's not worth your time or money. It is more like live action cartoon. Rupert Friend was by many more menacing in ""Homeland"" then in this flick. The movie lacks also any kind of humour - to have this kinda nonsense plot you have throw some humour because you can be deadly serious when having this kind of plot and premise.Overall, ""Hitman: Agent 47"" is even worse then it predecessor. It has only one more or less cool scene which is in interrogation room, but it lacks only for ~3 min. Wheter you like the game or not, this movie best to avoid by any cause.",Hitman - Agent 47
28,tabuno,An Good Improvement on the Spy/Sci Fi Genre,8,13 January 2019,"21 August 2015. Hit-man 47 (2015). This movie might be best called a euro-movie hybrid that captures the spy/assassin, sci fi movie genres and creates a contemporary action thriller with an Asian motif. There are some amazing, unusual architectural design background and foreground shots that light up the screen. There are elements of the kick-ass and blow them up of Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003), the amazing female acrobatics of Hanna (2011), along with the combat of titans from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).Along the way, there are few mental flaws with the logic of the movie with one person getting away from death too easily and another breaking what should have been impregnable windows. As for the martial arts and fighting scenes, it's hard to believe everything on the screen unlike Matt Damon's performance in The Bourne Identity (2002). On the other hand, there is time for a more natural character development along with a focused emotive theme that doesn't resort to flashy stereotypes.First time director Aleksander Bach brings a fresh cinematographic style to the full screen and maintains a bait and fish game until half way through the movie when it turns into a meticulous chase scene with some nice mental considerations for avoiding electronic tracking and use spy strategy in addition the more traditional physical superiority skills.Overall, this movie is an improvement on the state of current movies out there, while it doesn't have any breakthroughs, it is a solid and step up from many of its predecessor's.Second review (7/9/2017). Beginning fight sequence seems too over the top, unlike the more consistently and deliberately styled and choreography of Bunraku (2010). But for a lot of this movie, it becomes a sort of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) duo fighting theme one against another. Then there's the added component of humanistic identity as depicted in Kurt Russell's character in Soldier (1998). A bit of weak point includes Hannah Ware's character caught so blatantly on a video camera, a little too scripted even though there is a subsequent explanation. Then does Hannah Ware really go for a dip without a top? Couldn't tell, a small missed opportunity to enhance an intimate, informal, voyeuristic moment. But interestingly Zachary Quinto's character, wait for it, wait for it, has a nice surprise later in the movie though earlier it seemed to suck.This action assassin thriller is distinctive in its educational style theme in the first half of the movie similar to but less direct than the sequences found in The Spy Game (2001) with Robert Redford as the teacher and Brad Pitt the student. And there is a pretty obvious resemblance to fighting scenes and some of the same spy strategies as employed in the Bourne Identity (2002) series mostly in the beginning and main bulk of the movie. This movie nicely has a human heart at its core that eventually is displayed in a typical but effective scene as well as the predictable emotional consequences that never really get overly nor sickly sweetly steamy. There is also a nice but delicate balance of a tinge of humor spread throughout the movie. And finally there is also a little bit of director Quentin Tarantino influence by the end of the movie. An enjoyable, action thriller worth the ride.",Hitman - Agent 47

30,Reno-Rangan,"A complete action pack, with not so popular actors.",6,4 December 2015,"This is the second version, or we could say the reboot after the 2007 film did not receive well. This should have been a franchisee with at least 3-4 films by now. It's very clear that something is not working out for it. As for this film, there are several issues. But fairly did at the box office, which is poor for an action film like this. From the director who had never worked on any project before and the writers with good experiences.The money was well spent, the production quality was so good, then what is the trouble? Well, my first point out is the casting. Preferably someone top star who can pull the crowd into the cinema halls. Perhaps Jason Statham would have been a better choice, after Paul Walter's death who was suppose to play the lead. I'm not denying, but Rupert Friend was very good in the replace. But my point is there's no star value in this project, especially for the foreign markets, these lead stars are the strangers.The other drawbacks are, this film rated R, which is utterly pointless. Because there are no kisses, no sexy outfits, or drugs consumption, but only violence and gore which are mostly CGI works. Could you believe what the films are turned out to be nowadays. LOL. Though, I enjoyed the action sequences, so I can't thumb down and it does not enough to me to thumb up as well. Decent story with a speedy narration. Definitely an average film. Never seen Singapore better than in this film before. You could watch it for the time-pass and for the stunts, or in a situation when there are no other options available.6/10",Hitman - Agent 47
31,leonblackwood,Surprisingly quite good! 5/10,5,6 February 2016,"Review: I really wasn't expecting that much from this movie because there wasn't much hype when it was originally released but it actually wasn't that bad. The action scenes were pretty impressive and the storyline was detailed and put together well. Rupert Friend was the perfect choice for Agent 47 and Hannah Ware put her new found abilities to good use but it seemed very straight laced and to the point. Rupert Friend plays Agent 47, whose an genetically enhanced super soldier created by Doctor Pitor Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds). The Russian geneticist, disappears before the completion of the Agents project and leaves behind his daughter, Katia (Hannah Ware) who is being hunted down by agent 47, who works as a hit-man for the ICA (International Contracts Agency) and is contracted to find her father. His most recent targets were mercenaries led by Delriego (Rolf Kanies) who have been trying to find Litvenko in order to recreate the Agent program for his own means. Meanwhile, Katia is living in Berlin and is also looking for her father and constantly deals with her acute ability to see and hear things well outside a person's normal sensory radius. Whilst travelling on a subway, Katia is approached by a man who calls himself John Smith (Zachary Quinto), who tells her that agent 47 is on his way to kill her and that he is there to protect her and has information about her father. She then puts her life in his hands and they manage to escape from Agent 47, who grazes Katia's arm with a sniper shot. They then hide out in a hotel room were Katia reveals her information to find her father. John Smith tells her that he is working for Syndicate International and he tells her that her father can speak 3 languages and has stage 3 Lung cancer. When they put together all of the clues, Katia works out were her father could be but Agent 47 bursts through the door and kills Smith before knocking out Katia. When she wakes up, Agent 47 tells her that she is also an agent and that her abilities are more advanced than his. He then explains how she can channel her amazing abilities during combat against the Syndicates henchmen. John Smith then reappears and reveals that he has an engineered subdermal body armor which means that he can take gunshots without being harmed. After escaping from Smith and the Syndicates henchmen again, Katia makes the agent promise that her father won't be harmed if she reveals his location, which is in Singapore. When they eventually find Litvenko, he explains to Katia why he had to abandon her at such a young age and he refers to agent 47 as her brother. He constantly uses his inhaler, which he keeps close by his side and they become under attack by the syndicate, who capture Litvenko and put him through gruesome torture because they want him to reopen the agent program. Katia crashes a helicopter into the Syndicates headquarters and agent 47 gets through there security, disguised as a firefighter. They then fight against the Syndicates henchmen and agent 47 comes face to face with John Smith, who he eventually defeats by electrocuting him. On the rooftop, the head of the Syndicate, LeClerq, manages to escape with Litvenko in a helicopter while Agent 47 and Katia are fighting against the security and Litvenko detonates the inhaler, which turns out to be an explosive which Agent 47 handed to him earlier. There is a sense of intensity throughout the movie which made it interesting. I can tell that most of the budget went on the action scenes because there isn't any A-Class actors, who would have made the movie more attractive to audiences. With that aside, I still enjoyed it and I hope that the next one will have some top actors on board. Enjoyable!Round-Up: When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I really thought that it was Orlando Bloom in the lead because he really does look like Rupert Friend, 34, whose known for his performances in Homeland, Young Victoria and Pride and Prejudice. He also starred in the great Starred Up, The Libertine, The Last Legion and the weird Zero Theorem so he has some experience in front of the camera. This is the first movie directed by, Polish born Aleksander Bach who took on quite a big project as his first movie. He done quite a good job, in terms of the action and the intense storyline but it still felt like it was missing something. For a franchise that didn't go down to well in the past, it certainly made a big profit at the box office and judging by the ending, I'm sure we're going to see another movie in this franchise soon.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $83millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/thrillers starring Rupert Friend, Ciaran Hinds, Zachary Quinto, Jurgen Prochnow, Angelababy and Jerry Hoffmann. 5/10",Hitman - Agent 47

The only thing I knew about Hit-man: Agent 47 is that it's based on the video game which I have played a few times, is the squeal to a movie so bad, I've only seen once and what the trailer showed me which was everything.If you see the trailer than you know everything about the movie. The entire plot and all the twist and turns are actually in the trailer which makes no sense.That should not bother me that much after all it's an action movie. You can forgive the trailer telling the whole story of the movie if the action was tight.It was not. It was like Agent 47 was trying to shoot me from a foot away while I was standing still, and missed every time. Well, to be fair, not every time. Agent 47 had one or two ""oh snap"" moments, but considering the movie was littered with what was suppose to be super cool stylish action sequences, one or two is not gonna cut it.Zachary Quito was pretty cool in this movie. Makes me feel bad that this is all he could get after Star Trek. Although I have to say I've seen him do better battle scenes as Mr. Spock than I've seen with this movie.So, Agent 47 could have been a more Sci-fi driven, superhero influenced Taken, but it's not worthy to lick Liam Neeson bootsCatch it on Netflix if there is nothing else to watch.",Hitman - Agent 47

Rupert Friend plays Hit-man Agent 47 as basically a human terminator, he does play it well I must say. Everybody else plays there parts pretty well. There are some surprises in some corners.

Rupert plays the Hit-man:Agent 47,the 47th assassin created by Ciaran, a genetics scientist that worked on splicing the genes of fear and love out of his human experimental volunteers and increased their strength, speed and aggression to make a super soldier. After he made about 43 more of these assassins-the count got up to 90-he decided that he had a change of heart and abandoned the program, going into hiding, taking his research with him. Hannah plays Ciaran's daughter that is searching for him and being pursued by just about everyone else that thinks she can lead them to her father-some people want to restart the program. Zachery plays a man that tries to help Hannah avoid all these people looking for her, plus, he has a few secrets himself. The action is amped up with lots of hand to hand fights, gun battles and car/motorcycle chases but the plot could have used a little more effort to balance it out; sometimes, it just seemed like it would go from one battle or chase to another, without an explanation of who was after who or even why. It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. If you are in the mood for some mindless action that is light on plot then this one is for you.

35,alindsay-al,A boring unfocused film,2,28 August 2015,"Another video game adaptation has been made in hit-man agent 47 and this film just proves the point that these films are just not that good. The premise of the film sees agent 47 and this girl attempt to find her father to stop a group create an army of agents. Now rupert friend plays agent 47 and I actually think he did a decent job with the role and was the best part of the movie. He was methodical and cunning at times just like in the games and he sold the emotionless character very well. However, because of that lack of emotion he comes across as a bit of a boring character and he is written to do some pretty stupid stuff. The rest of the cast are just pretty ridiculous. The main girl just has absolutely nothing about her and she is literally the blandest character you will ever see in a film. Zachary quinto is a good actor but not in this film, his character was way too over the top and just completely cliché that you won't care. The story is completely non existent, there is literally nothing to this films narrative and you will not care about the stakes or the situation in the film. The dialogue is either really cheesy or just pointless exposition. Seriously that's all it is and it really does not help in fleshing out any of these characters. The style is alright, there are some pretty decent action scenes with some heavy hits which I enjoyed. However, there is an over reliance on slow motion in this film and after the 3rd time I started to get angry about it. Also some of the CGI looked really bad and like they run out of budget for the movie. Overall this is an awful movie that you really should avoid.",Hitman - Agent 47

His daughter is the key to finding him, and the Syndicate is eager to find him to restart the program.The daughter Katia, now an attractive adult is herself looking for her father, but she also seems to have heightened senses if not downright clairvoyance. A guy named Smith approaches her and tells her that someone is after her and offers protection. And indeed, Agent 47 shows up shooting up the place and fighting with Smith. They manage to escape and Katia reveals her research on her father to Smith, based on intel he shares, she thinks she known where he is. 47 shows up again and shoots Smith. There is a revelation about Katia identity and her relationship to 47. Now both 47 and Katia join forces to find the father as Smith and his goons are out to get them and the dad as well.In the process there are car chases, plenty of fights and shootouts. They do find the old man who eventually is grabbed by the Syndicates boss, someone many agents have failed to eliminate. Will 47 succeed with the help of Katia and her dad? First things first. Gamers by now should have leaned that video games don't make good source material for movies, hence most movie adaptations are poor. Except that Hit-man: Agent 47 is very good. Still, as reviews here show, gamers aren't satisfied and they never will be. And that's fine. The game is a game, the movie is a movie. I don't care whether this is faithful or not, or whether it conforms to someone's fantasy of the games. As an action movie Hit-man: Agent 47 is very satisfying. You have a very strong cast in Friend, Ware, Hinds, Kretschmann. Now the problem is that few actors can pull off the bald look--Olyphant didn't, Friend does it a little better but he's still not the ideal Hit-man, despite being a great actor. Ware does a good job as the girl who unwillingly and unwittingly finds herself thrust in the role of an action heroine. But once she pulls her lovely hair back, it's on. Hinds is always great, and reminded me here a bit of DeNiro.The story is strong and offers some surprises. The movie is very stylish, in the typical German modern style. All the fight scenes are good and thrilling, but they are not as loud as American fights. And it's surprising when a punch isn't accompanied by the usual excessively loud sound of cabbage being beaten.In the end, I wanted more Hit-man: Agent 47, a longer movie that could have clarified the story a bit more, more fights, more stunts. This movie compared to most action movies these days is far more restrained in its ambitions. And that's fine. 47 and Katia make a great pair for future sequels.",Hitman - Agent 47

Lots of mind rotting eye candy and some predictable, formulaic action sequences. To be fair, some of the action is well executed but its not enough on its own to carry this film. The storyline is too simplistic and shallow and the characters of the one dimensional, cardboard variety. My advice, if you like flashy commercials for, say, exotic cars, phones, computers, watches and other unnecessarily expensive consumables watch them instead.

38,peterp-450-298716,"Brainless violence, excessive slow motion and no story at all ... Does that sound like a video game ?",5,25 January 2016,"""We determine who we are by what we do.""Before, when I had no responsibilities and enough time in the evening, I was hopelessly addicted to playing video games. Many hours I spent behind my monitor slogging myself through all sorts of levels. Wondering what would follow. I had this relentless drive to improve myself on all fronts. Nowadays, I can't bring myself to stare at a screen for hours as an addict. On the one hand I don't have the time anymore and on the other hand I don't feel like doing that anymore. But I do get excited every time there's an attempt to make a film adaptation of a video game. The meager attempts there have been to date (and somewhat successful in my opinion) are for me the ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Resident Evil"" franchise. But still there's something subtle missing in those movies when you compare them with their console version. Perhaps it's because you don't have control over it and must undergo it. Perhaps the reason is plain simple. Maybe video games aren't suitable for screen adaptations.What about this Hit-man film? Unfortunately, I haven't seen the original film from 2007. So I have no clue how bad or good that was. And I don't know what comparables there are with this version of ""Hit-man : Agent 47"". Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) is a cold-blooded, dispassionate secret agent who is a kind of reincarnation of Neo, mixed with John Wick and ""The Equalizer"". Fearless, intelligent, very fast and deadly. On the cover you see a bald, unemotional man in a sleek black suit and a red tie, holding two dangerous looking guns. A genetically engineered assassin, originating from the laboratory of Dr. Pitor Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds). Apparently everybody is looking for Litvenko. But all have their own reasons to find him. Agent 47 is looking for the abandoned daughter Katia (Hannah Ware). His task is to eliminate her, so that the ""Syndicate International"" can't use her to track Litvenko. This organization wants to restart the Agent program.""Hit-man: Agent 47"" is nothing more than a series of action-packed scenes full of meaningless violent confrontations with a rather weak storyline. The violence is abundant and waves of extreme skirmishes hit you continuously. At those moments you'll witness the superhuman features like for instance a sub-dermal titanium body armor (yep). In addition, there's excessive use of slow-motion effects. Not exactly innovative. So don't expect a complicated story. It's all pretty predictable and simplistic. You can't say the dialogs are intelligent or interesting.The characters can be seen as very sterile. But claiming Rupert Friend just shows a total lack of emotion and nothing else, is kind of ridiculous, since this is a key feature of Agent 47. This manipulated agent can't comprehend the concept of emotions.Hit-man provides amusement and brings mindless entertainment, but as a whole it's anything but a real hit.

39,masonsaul,Really bad but fun in places,4,25 May 2019,"Hitman: Agent 47 is a bad video game adaptation. The cg is cheap, the acting is bad, the plot is stupid and filled with plot holes and a surprising amount of the action is poorly filmed. However, it's only 90 minutes, it's fun in places in a so bad it's extremely funny way and Rupert Friend is good as Agent 47.",Hitman - Agent 47
40,robertemerald,Slick and stylist all gun action thriller,9,5 March 2019,"Amazing stunts, brilliantly choreographed gun-fights, slamming car chases, all add up to a good 90 mins of pure entertainment, supported by a beautiful leading lady, a disciplined to-the-point hitman and a couple of dastardly villeins. I've seen at least one of previous Hitman movies and this is a major leap forward. Bond movies would be jealous. What they did with a helicopter was insane. It could have had a little more sophistication, perhaps with the soundtrack and better use of world locations, but that would be as far as true criticisms could venture. The other Hitman movies were good, this one is great.",Hitman - Agent 47
41,TheOneThatYouWanted,Glad I waited for TV,3,7 September 2016,"Agent 47.So I watched about 20 minutes of this before changing the channel. The poorly written story with gaps in knowledge and wooden acting was too much for me to handle. I have no idea how a film with a budget like this can come off as a fan fiction piece but whatever, I just don't give a penny. And if you're wondering, when I say penny I mean the four letter word that starts with an S and ends with an ""it."" Remember that word I was talking about just a second ago? Well, you can add the letter H somewhere in the middle of it. Anyway, Mindless action without a real plot or good acting is wasted because all the action is just CGI and after a while it just looks all the same. Like one stupid video game or something, ironically enough.",Hitman - Agent 47
42,Seraphion,How a low budget and low commitment can damage a franchise title,5,23 October 2015,"This movie really looks like a disaster. Yes it meets the most minimum standard for a kick back action flick to spend your time at your couch. But it really doesn't worth any money watching in the cinemas. With all the cooler action scenes already spoiled in the trailers, there's really nothing else to expect from the rest f this movie. Also the story gets to be quirky since it changes the focus from 47's strategic approach of infiltration to a stupid premonition like abilities by the girl. The story just doesn't support the title as it crumbles before the title's reputation in the game industry. The acting overall is just as bad. Rupert Friend went really flat. Yes 47 supposed to be calm and calculated hit man, but at least show a little more expression as he concentrates or get shocked in combat. Hannah Ware also gets weird fast as she looks quite flat too. Zachary Quinto did just okay, is role's stupidity blew it all away. Subdermal armor, really? Ciaran Hinds and Thomas Kretschmann really have their potential underutilized.",Hitman - Agent 47
43,yoggwork,"Shooting all seconds, standing unshielded seconds 360 degrees, the protagonist halo is too strong",5,19 February 2019,"In addition to the classic biochemistry and Laura (relying on the popularity of the protagonists), the adaptation of the game can only expect Warcraft (relying on faith and a variety of historical stories). Shooting all seconds, standing unshielded seconds 360 degrees, the protagonist halo is too strong",Hitman - Agent 47
44,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,So much boredom,3,2 September 2015,"In addition to writing the story and co-writing the screenplay, ""Skip Woods"" also produced the film, and was the only producer credited who was not a member of the Producer's Guild. Also, the other screenwriter (Michael Finch) did not work directly with Woods, as his name was separated by the word *and*, rather than an ampersand, &. This all makes it a bit more suspect as to whether ""Skip Woods"" is a real person, or just a pseudonym, as some believe.Anyway, I liked some of the aerial photography of Berlin, and Singapore (two places I enjoyed visiting several years ago, which brought back fond memories) and 47's suit looked quite nice also (I've always appreciated a nice suit as well) and the girl is cute, but the remainder of this was a slick looking void, one part video game, one part Terminator ripoff. Film's first action sequence amounts to nothing more than 47 striking poses in slow motion, as he takes out a seemingly never ending series of anonymous henchmen, followed by Terminator rehashed for about a half an hour, topped with some of the stupidest character behaviour (Katia gets bored and decides to dismantle 47's guns while he's sleeping!) and a ridiculous exploding helicopter climax, with some of the poorest CGI explosion effects I've seen since Asylum's Scyfy network garbage. Of course, all of these things could make it laughably bad, however, if that is what one is looking for. Personally though, I just didn't get it.",Hitman - Agent 47
45,moviexclusive,"Loud, dumb but executed with enough flair and momentum not to bore, this 'Hitman' reboot is a passable diversion",6,19 August 2015,"Anyone who's ever harboured the dream of seeing Singapore feature prominently in a Hollywood movie will certainly be pleased with 'Hitman: Agent 47"", which features iconic landmarks such as Gardens by the Bay and Marina South in their full glory. A pivotal supporting character is seen admiring the orchids in the Gardens' Cloud Forest dome, before taking a stroll along the OCBC Skyway. The headquarters of a sinister group known as the Syndicate Organisation is situated right in the heart of Marina South, against the backdrop of the Marina Bay Financial Centre and Asia Square towers. And last but not least, there is even a full-scale shootout in broad daylight along downtown Robinson Road, which probably has never seen and will never see as many Comfort taxis at the same time.We're not sure what it took to convince the producers and filmmakers of this video game adaptation to bring part of the production here, but hey it is one of the few thrills in an otherwise loud and dumb action thriller. To be frank, we weren't expecting much from this reboot of the earlier EuropaCorp film starring Timothy Olyphant in the titular role of a chrome-domed, genetically engineered, emotionless contract killer from not so far back in 2007; after all, if there is one demographic that it would try to please, it is the video-gamers who adore stepping into the shoes of the cold-blooded assassin to kill off his enemies while wrecking maximum carnage in the process, which was probably in the one-line brief that Fox gave to veteran commercials director Aleksander Bach here.Hamstrung by a muddled script by Skip Woods (who also wrote the earlier 'Hitman' movie) and Michael Finch, Bach falls back on a breakneck pacing and flashy visuals to gloss over the film's obvious storytelling flaws. Yes, despite an intriguing first half-hour that teases the characters' motivations, the rest of the film is unfortunately as straight-forward as it gets in plotting the cat- and-mouse game between Katia (Hannah Ware) and a certain John Smith (Zachary Quinto) dispatched by Syndicate HQ. Katia is the crucial link to the Agent programme's lead scientist Dr. Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds), whom the Syndicate's head honcho Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) needs to restart the programme. Another organisation however has sent Rupert Friend's Agent 47 to prevent Katia from falling into the hands of the Syndicate, though it isn't quite clear what they want from her.The less you think about the plot, the more you are likely to enjoy the visceral pleasures that the film offers. True to the spirit of its source material, the action here is brutal and pulsating, with heads blown off, bodies sucked into giant jet engines, limbs slashed and blood basically splattering everywhere (and for those who are wondering, much of the bloodletting takes place in interiors rather than exteriors, so don't get your hopes up about seeing all that happening along our streets). Bach choreographs and executes the action with gory flair, and fans of the IO Interactive game will be glad to know that he makes the effort to retain its aesthetics.Yet no matter how diverting the shootouts or fisticuffs may be, there is no hiding the fact that the characters are under-written. Though Friend makes for a surprisingly good Agent 47 - and we are not just talking about his looks - the actor best known for his supporting part in 'Homeland' is shortchanged by the script's reluctance to develop fully the theme of choice versus blind obedience. Ware makes a sufficiently harried female protagonist, but Quinto is utterly wasted in a role that doesn't quite know what to do with him after it is revealed that he is actually working for the Syndicate. Veterans Hinds and Kretschmann have even more limited roles, but their natural gravitas elevates their presence just ever so slightly.Of course, you'll probably should not expect a film like 'Hitman: Agent 47' to be moulded on an intricate plot or deep characters, and true enough, it isn't. Rather, it takes its action seriously, which is what its target demographic is likely to assess it on anyways - and in that regard, it succeeds as a fast-paced thrill ride all right, even though it is equally mind-numbing. That said, there is greater relish watching some of the action unfold in our very own backyard, no matter that the reasoning for re-locating the action from Berlin to Singapore midway through the film is tenuous at best, and the novelty in watching the sights we are familiar with within a big-budget Hollywood action thriller makes it slightly more enjoyable.",Hitman - Agent 47
46,quincytheodore,"Underneath the disguise of flashy cinematic and noise effects, Hit-man: Agent 47 is sadly, still a misfire of corny script and abysmal plot.",5,21 August 2015,"As an action flick, it's certainly brimming with cool choreography as characters partially dance and partially John Woo dive their way through hail of bullet. Unfortunately, the plot is nonsensical and inconsistent. It's understandable that the team wanted to create larger than life plot, but the process needs more delicacy than taking small scenes of the game and throws a bunch of popular gimmicks from Terminator to Minority Report, then hopes it would work or audience would suspend their belief.Story is the typical enhanced soldier theme. Granted, the video games used same narrative, but then it gets ridiculously over-the-top and even borderline supernatural. It follows Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) as he tries to find the scientist who pioneered the super soldier program by finding his daughter Katia (Hannah Ware).The movie revolves around finding this scientist and shady organization trying to revive the program. For a stoic character such as 47, the movie pairs him with female lead for more interaction, otherwise it'd be just all business and murder. It doesn't help that Katia is one dimensional and honestly equally stiff, the chemistry between them is hardly engaging.It's also odd that the multi-million organization and legendary assassins treats Katia as though she holds all the secret. The plot actually hinges entirely on her, and at times she even depicts as having clairvoyance skill. Script uses a lot of flamboyant one-liners, almost as in gibberish cat poster.With all of these quirky narrative and plot discrepancy, it's really hard to take the movie seriously. Story feels like a pretense to push the pace to next grand set pieces. To its credit, it does have plenty of stylish cinematography. Using all sorts of nifty choreography, dual wielding gunslinger combat in exotic places, it has ample bombastic action.Note that one of Hit-man games actually titled Silent Assassin and it's also the highest rank in game. The cerebral or tactical approach is used sparsely, and those don't even appear natural. In fact, without the suit and Hit-man on the title you wouldn't even recognize it as Hit-man movie, probably some Universal Soldier spin-off.It's definitely an explosive spectacle, but sadly also a mindless one. If this is how video game is, still, translated to silver screen, it doesn't convey the game's core story, or any presentable story in general.",Hitman - Agent 47
47,Terryfan,Go see it for yourself you might be surprise,7,5 September 2015,"I went and saw Hit-man: Agent 47 in theaters this afternoon mostly out of boredom and I haven't been to the movies for a while so why not have some fun and it is the weekend after all.While I do know that the film is inspired by Hit-man the video game series I don't know much about the game in terms of it's characters or the story line but I do know about the games.Normally movies based on video games are often times mix results some are good some are bad some are so bad it's good however some are just awful.But Hit-man: Agent 47 does present itself with more than enough to make it watchable.The films stars Rupert Friend as Agent 47, Hannah Ware as Katia van Dees,Zachary Quinto as John Smith, Ciarán Hinds as Dr.Litvenko, Thomas Kretschmann as Antoine LeClerq, Angelababy as Diana. The plot of the films centers around Agent 47 an assassin must teams up with Katia to help not only unlock the mysteries of her past but to also find her father. However things are not what they appear to be as the story advances.What I like best about this movie were the stunts which were pretty insane. It doesn't start off like that at first as we get a introduction about the Agents program but after that it's game on as we see how powerful Agent 47 is. The character development is really good they took the time to give the characters time to develop so we could get to understand them more which is rare in action filmsThe fight and action scenes steal the show there were moments that I thought to myself ""Oh you have got to be kidding me"" And believe me there is a lot of those moments in this film. I also love the music in the film, I hope they release a soundtrack for the music because it really matches the story of the film and it is very well done each piece of music works and helps brings the story and the characters out. What also makes the movie different is that the protagonist's greatest threat is the mind which proved here to be the most powerful weapon of them all and it will make you go wow. However this film does feature some very violent scenes that I don't suggest letting younger eyes see. Also the way the kills happen makes you go wow.No wonder why this got a R Rating which allow for little limitation.But this was actually a surprise film to watch at the theater and it did give me a enjoyable watch. Sure it's not a perfect film but it's based off a video game where you are suppose to have fun and that's what you get with Hit-man: Agent 47, a enjoyable action film that makes you go wow.There are moments in the plots that make you not understand however it does also feature plenty of plot twists that make you go I didn't see that coming SO with wild stunts, insane action scenes and unexpected plot twists there is something to make Hit-man: Agent 47 worth the trip to the movies.I give Hit-man: Agent 47 an 7 out of 10",Hitman - Agent 47

Still, if you just want to watch something with some action, then this is as good of a time-killer as anything else, maybe even more so if you're a fan of the video games that it's based on, although I suppose that would depend on just how faithful they've been to the source material.

49,Screen_Blitz,An ill-fated adaption to the video game franchise,2,26 March 2016,"For the past two decades, video games have become a source material to film adaptations, and most of which have proved to be unsuccessful. With the exceptions of 'Mortal Kombat' and some of the Resident Evil movies, most film adaptations to video games have come out very poor results not only by lazy acting and directing but simply because the structure of video games don't translate too well on film. Filmmakers try so hard to make the movies so close to the games that they hoarder over the style of games and the end results are often films that feel more like live-action games without control than actual films. This is certainly the consequence that occurs in this film adaption of the successful video game franchise by IO Interactive. Directed by first-time filmmaker Aleksander Bach, Rupert Friend plays Agent 47, a genetically engineered gun-totting assassin with high intelligence created by Russian scientist Dr. Peter Litvenko (played by Ciaran Hinds). With the help of the Litvenko's daughter Katie (played by Hannah Ware), 47 fights against an evil corporation who armed with a league of powerful clones much stronger than him, and searches to the truth of his origins.Everything shown in the trailer is just about everything you need to see in this film, everything else is left to be an utter eye-sore to those who are looking for a fun, excitement-filled action flick. This all begins with some unrealistic action sequences filled with poorly animated blood spatters and CGI work that simply doesn't fit, although they manage to devoid from ridiculous shaky camera work that's become a gimmick in many action films today. The gun shootouts that take place are supposed to fun and pulse-pounding, but end up being rather tedious, though there is an intense car crash sequence that manages to work. Unless you grow fond in near constant slow motion action scenes, the excitement is pretty much left dry. Even worse, the characters including Agent 47, Katie, and the character played by Zachary Quinto feel so one- dimensional that you never come to care for these characters. With proper writing and character development, the characters become difficult to root for. Rupert Friend who plays the titular character looks so bored in his role and show almost no emotion for most of the time. The plot is fine per say, but nothing truly memorable or fleshed out in any way, consisting of mostly exposition dialogue and antagonist sadly underwritten. The plot is just too thin and underdeveloped to be compelling. Hit-man: Agent 47 is just another film adaption of a video game gone wrong by a lazy script and direction. This movie fails in many areas and is utterly difficult to recommend to even the least demanding action fans out there. It comes to show that films based on video games have not shown any improvement in the past several years and are not likely to do so in the near future. If you have seen this movie, don't worry you aren't missing anything.",Hitman - Agent 47
50,drjgardner,No Hit Here,2,28 August 2015,"If you were a fan of Timothy Oliphant's ""Hitman"" (2007), avoid this new version which borrows only slightly from the original. The plot itself is reasonable, but the acting is so stiff that it's hard to be engaged. Of course if the basic premise is that ""agents"" are designed to show minimal emotions, you're not going to expect to see Brando-like histrionics on the screen. But just about everyone is devoid of any facial or tonal expressions. And what happened with casting Jurgen Prochnow (""Das Boot"") for a 30 second cameo? Only Ciaran Hinds (""Above Suspicion"") turns in a reasonable performance.The best thing about this film is the location shooting in Singapore.",Hitman - Agent 47

52,RforFilm,"With not much of a target, Hit-man: Agent 47 still misfires",3,24 August 2015,"The trouble with any kind of adaptation into film is that they're trying to take something that was perfectly suited for one medium and make it into something else. That's not to say that it's a bad idea, as many adaptation figure out what needs to change in order for a film representation to work. No one can tell an entire life story, so a biography needs to pick and choose which parts are important. A novel's pacing needs to be sped up in order to feel like a journey we're observing rather then reading about. So why are video games such a tough nut to crack?The leading answer has to do with out main protagonist. At least in a biography or novel, we still have a fully established character that with the right actor can work in film format. A video game character may have some personality traits, but the idea is that YOU are the star. YOU'RE the one killing bad guys and saving the princess. Hit-man is a prime example of an empty shell that you take control of rather then watch for one's personal journey. After getting a film adaptation in 2009, Hit-man: Agent 47 gets another shot at a cinematic adventure. In the heart of the Ukraine, a secret lab has been set that takes children and alters their genes in order to make them the ultimate killing machines. Gone are pain and most emotion in place of enhanced fighting skills and gunmanship. They are without names, but numbers that are forever implanted with a barcode in the back of their heads. One successful agent is 47 (played by Rupert Friend), who in in Berlin tracking a young woman. She is Katia Van Dees (played by Hannah Ware) who herself is looking for a man she remembers, but doesn't even know who he is.47 tracks her in Berlin where he prepares to encounter her. Just as he's getting closer, a CIA agent John Smith (played by Zachary Quinto) find her first and gets her away from the hit-man ala Terminator fashion. They try heading to the American embassy, but 47 gets inside and continues his hunt for the young woman. Just as Katia makes it to safety, she starts to sense uneasiness with John Smith and learns that 47 wants to keep her safe rather then kill her. He too has been looking for the same man and all traces lead to Singapore.The idea of Hit-man has some potential as a film series. None of that is visible in Hit-man: Agent 47. I didn't know what to expect as I've never played the games, barley remember the original movie, and am not even sure if there's still an audience wanting a Hit-man movie. I guess I got what I expected, which was a mindless, action-spy thriller of sorts. I just don't know what Fox had in mind. Parts of the movie want to be a senseless, run and gun feature or an intriguing dive into the corruption of a mad scientist's experiment.Hit-man: Agent 47 tries to meet halfway in the middle, coming out more like a Michael Bay film. I'll give it credit for at least being short, but that still can be a drag given that none of the actors offer much. I can understand Rupert Friend not having emotion, but I was surprised by how bland everyone else came out. How do you make the same guy who gave Spok on Star Trek new life emptiness? By putting him in this movie. I wasn't mad or even that disappointed with Hit-man: Agent 47 as this film only exists to fill in future space on cable television rainy afternoons. I'll give this three barcode tattoos out of ten. Had the story been more crazy or even had bad actors, I would have felt more ripped off, but at the most, the movie is simply bland. I'd say check it out if you're a fan of the game, but most people will be scratching their heads wondering if this is still relevant.",Hitman - Agent 47
53,juliankennedy23,47 Ronin,6,22 January 2017,"First, let's get this out of the way. This is not as good as the video game that spawned it. Rupert Friend almost looks the part but simply doesn't have that Agent 47 quality. It is a little like if you had Jennifer Aniston play Lara Croft. Rupert isn't helped by a plot that suffers from this time it's personal syndrome (see latest Bond films). Everybody is someone's sister, father, cousin, former chiropractor's receptionist. It is a tired idea that has been beaten to death in action films of late.So the acting is subpar, the story is filled with tired tropes and it doesn't do justice to the source material. Thank god it looks so good and the action set pieces that start okay get more spectacular as the movie moves along. If you can get past the someone subpar opening bit that is more Steven Seagal than Terminator the ride improves. That all this movie really is, a forgettable ride among some nice scenery.

I do like the premise and I think the character would be interesting to see. All three main characters: Rupert Friend, Zachary Quinto, and Hannah Ware were all not too bad but not exactly great. The action was flashy but didn't follow logical sense. The directing suffered from too quick cuts that made the scenarios confusing though I didn't have trouble following along. Though it looks like they thought of a sequel it doesn't look like that will play out in the future of this franchise. I'm tempted to forgive this since I like Rupert Friend from Homeland and Hannah Ware was not only beautiful but compelling as an assassin in training and I would have loved to see her blossom into an experienced killer. It seem that the screenwriter could get away with anything and I don't mind that suspension of disbelief but when I think about it later I don't buy it. I would rent this or wait for it to come on Netflix or whatever since it will probably be there quickly.

56,dfa120374,Nowhere Near As Bad As Some Make Out,7,25 October 2016,"Movies based on video games don't exactly have a great track record (Street Fighter, Super Mario Bros., Mortal Kombat, Max Payne), but personally speaking I think Hit-man: Agent 47 is one of the much better adaptations, even if it was a bit slow to start off with.Rupert Friend makes a surprisingly good 47 in this new movie, somehow getting the perfect tone for a character who kills without mercy but still has a few soft spots. Friend doesn't just look the part, he brings it to life, and I think he done a better job here than Timothy Olyphant for the first Hit-man film.47 is a man with several genetic enhancements that make him smarter, faster, and generally more lethal than the average person. His job, as the name of the movie states, is that of a hit-man - 47 goes around taking contracts to kill people so that the goals of others can be realised. 47's mission this time out is to stop an evil organization run by a man named Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) from starting up a new & improved Agent program. For this, they require the person responsible for the original program, Dr. Litvenko (Ciaran Hinds), but as he's off the grid, they are willing to settle for Litvenko's daughter, Katia van Dees (Hannah Ware), hoping she can lead them to her father.As long as you don't overthink the plot, you should find it an enjoyable film because spending more than a few moments contemplating all the whys will do nothing but lead to a headache. Take the movie as it is - an Action film, pure and simple, and a lot of the action within the film is very enjoyable to watch with some stylish scenes. The film does stray away from the stealth element quite a bit which is a bit disappointing as that is a big part of the game, but it's not a movie ruining aspect.Just remember - this is a movie adaptation of a game (a good adaptation at that) and at least it wasn't ruined by baffling casting decisions & strange story amendments i.e. Max Payne.",Hitman - Agent 47
57,p-jonsson,Cool action flick,8,26 May 2017,"I know, I know, this movie is rather superficial and simple. More effort has been spent on cool action than on depth of the story. Well, you know what? I do not care! I quite liked this movie. Agent 47 is cool and kicks ass. The bad guys gets plenty of ass whooping. The action is good. There is quite a lot of high tech and gadgets. What is there not to like? The movie starts of with a quite cool sequence introducing Agent 47. I have to say that I got into quite a bit of ""wow"" mode right a way there. The movie continues with plenty of action sequences with just a wee bit of slowdown in between. Actually the first-half, at least, of the movie is pretty much one long chase.Perhaps I should point out that I have not played Hit-man and do not really know what the original story is about. From a lot of the comments I have read it appears That this might be to my advantage when it comes to enjoying the movie.Some people are probably complaining about bad acting since Agent 47 do not really show much in terms of facial expressions or emotions. Well, news for you, he is not supposed to! He is supposed to be a cold emotionless killing machine so stop whining. Personally I found Agent 47 to be an excellent character. the re is on scene in particular that I liked where Agent 47 intentionally allows himself to be caught in a embassy. Once inside he, to no one in the audience surprise starts to tear the place apart. You have to see it to know what I mean.The second part, or perhaps just the last third, of the movie turns into more of a search and destroy for Agent 47 and his new ""partner"". this part is of course as action filled as the first part of the movie. Naturally it all leads to a big show down between the Agent 47 & Co. The and itself did not really deliver any surprises but was satisfying.The one thing in the movie that annoyed me was this subdermal armor stuff. The idea was not a too bad one but they really overplayed it. Come on! Just shoot him in the head or an eye or some other ""sensitive"" part for Christ sake. Bulletproof my arse! I honestly do not understand the low rating this movie has received. 5.7 at IMDb is really a bit harsh. Rotten Tomatoes rating is, not very surprisingly, abysmal. Rotten Tomatoes and their ""critics"" ratings must be the worst of any ratings site. When these dickwads rate down a movie, that's when I start to get interested. First step is to drill down into the real audience ratings which more often that not gives a different picture.Any way I digress. Bottom line is that, for me, this is a simple, straightforward, high octane action movie and I quite enjoyed it.",Hitman - Agent 47
58,backup-50362,Good generic action movie but a bad Hitman movie,1,27 April 2018,"It all comes down to the fact that Agent 47 doesn't look or act the part. The suit, gloves, his weapons - they're all very authentic, but his looks, voice, and especially his guns blazing style with explosions and insane noise making - it's all wrong. This isn't a silent assassin, it's more like Bruice WIllis in a suit on the set of Die Hard.First thing I noticed about the ""world"" of this movie is how badly men are portrayed - generic ""fat losers playing games"", generic wife beaters, generic all bad things. And they're included for no reason whatsoever. Just your typical ""we threw this unrelated scene in here to remind you men are horrible because we are Hollywood"". The vast, general unoriginality of this movie is shining almost as bright as the visual effects inside the many computer screens showing flashy animations unlike how any software works in real life but like how they often appear in most bad hacker movies.As per Hollywood law there's also a raggedy female sidekick wearing hipster homeless man clothes and untied shoes, waving a gun around (as you know, we need the strong whamen to be featured in every movie despite Agent 47's only minor sidekick being Agent Smith - a man, and even including him would've been a mistake).What killed me is that suddenly Diana makes an appearance and she's a generic demanding asian woman instead of a classy, middle aged british woman. Laughed my ass off. How hard was it to at least do this one simple thing right and hire a british woman to play a british woman? I bet she'll be black in the next movie, and maybe black, transgender and with purple hair in the third one, right? Lame ass virtue signalling Hollywood racial politics b/s.Seeing and hearing Diana, that's when I was finally like ""okay, I'm definitely not watching a Hitman movie"".Also, 47 isn't even the main character. ""The girl"" is. She's worthless until 47 finds her, then suddenly she's a ""cool killing machine"". She's ungrateful and annoying, just the most generic forced female character. So the movie isn't even about 47. The camera's on her way more than him. It's trash show on all ends. Speaking of ends, the ending is just as corny as the rest of it, and far from anything related to the games. Where as in the games Diana and 47 have a connection and care for each other, asian Diana here seems to not because it's more edgy that way according to Hollywood.Did I mention 47 ends up fighting a Terminator? Yes, it's not just Die Hard, ideas are rehashed from Terminator as well.They seem to have taken clues only from the one Hitman game that nobody likes and didn't have much to do with the franchise itself - Absolution.The best way to sum up this movie is calling it a mash-up of tired old action movie ideas with a knock-off Agent 47 thrown in it.I could've enjoyed the action aspects of it at least, if the story was somehow related to the game, or if men weren't portrayed this badly in no relation to the plot or any reason whatsoever. Or if the actor playing Hitman at least sort of looked or sounded like him. I don't understand why you won't just hire the voice actor for Agent 47 - he might be an older gent but he looks and SOUNDS the part - make a movie about 47 in his later years, whatever, I don't know. Bruice Willis is old and still stars in action movies - it can work. Of course even getting the real deal to play 47, you'll need good writing and this didn't have that.For fans of absolutely the most generic action movies of the 80's and 90's, and zero knowledge on the game series - you might enjoy this. For fans of the game series - you'll definitely not enjoy it, it's almost as bad as the previous Hitman movie with Timothy Olyphant, and that's some achievement.",Hitman - Agent 47
59,scottshak_111,It keeps getting farther and farther,6,10 September 2015,"Being one of the biggest fans of the Hit-man franchise, I am averse to hating anything that relates Agent 47. But even I am compelled to reserve all judgments when people decide to cash on the extraordinary franchise with their brainless mediocrity. Boy, do the movies suck! When I saw the trailer for Hit-man: Agent 47 for the first time, I was disappointed at once owing to its stupid screenplay. I still remember Rupert Friend saying ""But it is mine"" instead of a catchy witty comeback phrase to the question ""What kind of name is 47?"" I wanted a colossal name to helm the movie to do the character and game the justice it deserves but there was another bummer in the name of Aleksander Bach. The movie was heading towards disaster already.If you have played every game installment of Hit-man, you would quickly catch on the theme of the game-play and notice how brilliantly the protagonist has been created and how grave and well moulded the character is. In its beginning and happening run, the music of the game franchise was made by the music prodigy Jesper Kyd himself. He created 'out of the world' music that carved the bad-ass 47 into perfection. So naturally stakes were high when I walked into the theater with high hopes. To begin with Rupert Friend's 47 wasn't that good. His face though written with right expressions fails to nail 47. There is a constant brow wrinkle that just doesn't bereave him at any point. Is our 47 ever this sentient? No! The origin story, which actually happens to be mind-blowing has been fast forwarded like a cheap backdrop plot, to reach the fully fledged version of the assassin. We are literally 'introduced' to Diana, the character we all loved so madly for 'the-voice-in-his- ears' thrill, the character who is better hidden and we all adored for the sheer suspense of who she might be? Where is the subtlety of the game? Where did it all vanish?SPOILERS AHEAD:Being a silent assassin, Hit-man works subtly, but there is a shot where 47 fires in a full crowded Subway without bothering about its consequences. Even the fight sequences are average and they don't charge up your adrenaline. What was ridiculous when 47 touches Katia and suddenly she remembers everything. We are subjected to flashbacks deliberately made emotional to make it sound more interesting. Katia's character is even more pathetic. She is shown not just listening but seeing things too from far away. What makes it hugely indigestible is the fact that frames that are shown look as if she could see the future.Okay there are nostalgic moments with the signature dual Silver Ballers, the usual garrote fiber wire, the dress changing, the close point blanks, .45s, Deagle, Beretta, Glock 17, Blaser R93, the Blaser case, his renowned symbol, hiding by wearing victim's clothes, the suit, the tie, the bar code behind his head. But are these things really enough to make a good movie?The dark is missing from the movie. Even though there is some hideous gore, a lot of it gets spoiled by the movie's mediocre CGI. Marco Beltrami decides to wade into trance which was supposed to be drenched in Kyd-ish dark gravity. His music isn't at all profound and doesn't even come close to visiting the handsome Jesper Kyd's notes. Overall a big fiasco, I would say. I just hope Nolan, Cameron, Scorsese, Mendes or Boyle to take it up this project for a change and reboot the sh** outta it.",Hitman - Agent 47
60,Ramascreen,Not that bad,6,19 August 2015,"Not that bad.Well, this is certainly an improvement from the 2007 version but I wouldn't quickly say 'they finally got it right' just yet. I will say this, however, Hit-man: AGENT 47 makes me think that there's hope after all for game-based movies. It's entertaining at best.After the 2007 Xavier Gens-directed film starring Timothy Olyphant as agent 47, with a very weak story masked with pointless and poorly staged action sequences, the idea of revisiting this just wasn't appealing, especially with the casting of Rupert Friend who I think holds his own in ""Homeland"" series but I had my doubts if Friend could pull this off. I forgot that it really doesn't take much to play Agent 47, he's the guy who's supposed to not express feelings or emotions, so Hit-man: AGENT 47's story is quite simple, there's a mega-corporation that wants to start an agent program again. This relentless killing machine, Agent 47, who was the result of such program, wants to stop it from happening and he teams up with a young woman who holds the secret, and together they confront their past, their origins and ultimately their greatest foe.There's a little bit of ""Terminator""s 'come with me if you want to live' aspect here, not to mention that Zachary Quinto's villainous character has been injected with some kind of liquid metal body armor that makes him invincible. And I also find it amusing that this movie has its own 'syndicate' since we're fresh off watching ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"" Because Hit-man: AGENT 47 story is simple and formulaic and because it doesn't take much for Rupert Friend to play our hero, the questions now lies in how effective are the the action sequences and to a certain extent, they are, this movie's R-rated, so nothing is sacred, Agent 47 will aim for the head any chance he gets. But there are some sequences that aren't quite well-tied together, they're not quite well-explained, for example how one shot be at one place one second and then end up on that other corner the next second, and I think they're done for the sake of giving you an image of this much stealthier and stronger agent 47, but those sequences do come across as lazy or cop out at times. Hit-man: AGENT 47 is not perfect, but I think it's a decent enough start for the studio to plan a sequel instead of pressing the reboot button again.",Hitman - Agent 47

63,troyputland,Not a great game adaption... again.,4,14 September 2015,"Eight years have passed since the abysmal adaption Hit-man. Timothy Olyphant's agent was bland, clunky and awkward. Rupert Friend's agent fairs just as bad. He's the 47th human that's been genetically enhanced since birth, brought up to be a contract assassin, killing with no emotion. Emotions have been stripped from 47, making him the least affectionate character in film since the 2007 excursion. 47's helps a woman (Hannah Ware) find her father and discover the truth behind her dark past. Others are out to find her father and kill him, including crooked agent Zachary Quinto. All characters are bland, including Hannah Ware's Katia, the only one showing any emotion, made weak by a boring script. There's plenty of action, though. The kill count's high and the blood runs deep but the choreography's regimented and robotic. 47's never in danger. A few well-done set-pieces occur in Hit-man's 90 odd minutes, just enough to keep the mind occupied.",Hitman - Agent 47
64,Maleplatypus,"Unfortunately, only an action movie",7,28 October 2015,"Despite good casting, very good performances, more than a correct direction, camera work, sfx, editing and music, this movie is not excellent. It has no soul, as previous version (with Timothy Olyphant, 2007) did. Comparison is inevitable. This is only an action movie: a good bunch of action scenes and essentially a mindless fun. However, no character development or an explanation who, why, where, when and so on. Previous version had it all and if someone planned sequels (or a franchise), they should have done it eight years ago. Then it would make sense. Don't get me wrong here. This movie is not a bad one and the cast gave it all to make it entertaining. But for me that is just not enough, considering the template (video game) and possibilities to develop a good idea into a more complex and challenging story. This movie returns all to the level of the video game (maybe even below that). I think that these characters deserve more. So do we.

She had a personality. This movie has a female lead whose only emotion seems to be annoyance. The villain in the last movie was interesting. His plot was diabolical and believable. This movie has Zachory Quinto as the henchman and a very forgettable boss.The action was fine... a little jumpy during the hand to hand sequences, which implies the director didn't feel capable of directing a fist fight.All in all, worrisome in that it might kill the franchise before another decent Hit-man movie can be made.",Hitman - Agent 47
67,blrnani,Not nearly as bad as game fans make out,6,4 May 2018,"I came to this film by accident, a present from a friend who knew I really enjoyed ""Hitman (with Timothy Olyphant, Dougray Scott, Olga Kurylenko). I was initially disappointed, having hoped it was that original, but having watched it last night I found it worthwhile (while not coming close to the original).
The premise is interesting - once you can get your head round a rival with titanium injected under the skin that makes him bulletproof! It's a step further than Bond, which is sufficiently realistic to make it credible, for the most part - but for people who accept the Marvel universe it's an easy step.
The film follows through on the action precept, but what I found most interesting is the gradual awakening of the heroine to her full potential and the influence she has on her machine-like 'partner', based on the premise that we are what we choose to live by. It is a promise of potential redemption for a great many people who feel trapped into a future they want to escape.
The ending was a little weird, since 47 took a bullet for 90, yet seemed to suffer no ill effects, and then the two of them were confronted by a look-alike Agent 48, ordered up by controller Diana because 47 didn't take out 90 as well as the prime target. Assuming they survived, the pieces are all in place for a very good sequel, as 47 and 90 would presumably never feel safe as long as the other agents are still around and following Diana's orders.
And if they didn't survive, then presumably the other agents will continue operating for Diana (or her boss?) in a world akin to the videogame series (which I have not seen, I confess).",Hitman - Agent 47
68,abouhelier-r,Hit-man: Agent 47,6,4 September 2015,"An assassin teams up with a woman to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry.Hit-man: Agent 47 is directed by Aleksander Bach and stars Rupert Friend, Hannah Ware and Zachary Quinto. This film is based on the successful Hit-man video game series. Writers and producers are trying to reboot a film which basically failed at starting a franchise the first time. This former film was yet not good at all, the critics and people weren't very of it. I'm confused because there are so many other great stories that could be turned into movies beginning with Metroid or even Zelda for God sakes! Eventually Rupert Friend is good at portraying the Hit-man but his character is so boring, it's frustrating. Plus, Zachary Quinto really disappointed me as well. This film isn't that great and it eventually sucks. It's written by Skip Woods, the man who wrote X-Men Origins: Wolverine, A Good Day to Die Hard or Sabotage. Do I need to say more? The exposition is about 20minutes long, explaining the world of the movie to the audience, trying to overload us with information and yet you are supposed to care about these characters. Epic fail because you genuinely don't. Moreover, the film ""profits"" from modern day rapidly edited and quick-cut scenes but the thing is, we need to see things happened in an action movie. No one wants to wonder what their looking at. No one wants to see a blur of an action scene done with horrible choreography and fake stunt work. Each time this assassin pulls his guns out or shoot at things, it's in slo-motion. In fact, for every gun shoot scene, you have three to four dumb scenes. Finally you begin to deconstruct the movie and when you do that, you're not enjoying it.Overall I enjoyed mostly the Hit-man himself, Zachary Quinto would have made a good villain if he weren't to deal with this script. Hit-man: Agent 47 is a big mess.",Hitman - Agent 47
69,stephendaxter,"This was NOT Hit-man, just Dull and Boring for 90 minutes",3,29 October 2015,"As we wait for the day where a good video game movie will fall from the heavens and on to our movie screens, we have to sit through pieces of crap like Hit-man: Agent 47. This isn't just a bad adaptation of a video game, it is just simply a terrible movie. This was a complete bore-fest from start to finish with a few cool looking scenes occasionally. And to make it even better, it had literally nothing to do with the actual Hit-man games, why not just give it some other shitty name instead? By giving it the name 'Hitman' most people don't think of the popular video game, most people think of the 2007 adaptation, and trust me, you don't want people to relate your new film to that one.The main problem with the movie was how dull it was, every damn scene was completely lifeless, emotionless and some of the most unexciting stuff i've seen all year. Even the action, that is supposed to be fast paced and exciting was terribly boring. Some of it looked cool but thats all it had going for it. When an 'Action' film can't capitalise on the 'Action' it is destined to fail, and you have to wonder if these people know how to actually make a movie. Then you look at the director and realise that this is the ONLY FILM HE HAS EVER DIRECTED, EVER, and he hasn't even been involved in any other films...... WTF? But hey, he's directed some music videos........ that counts..... right? You can even see it in the film, the way it is put together is really sloppy, the pace is all over the place, and the whole film is incredibly generic. Even the plot of the film is just terrible, predictable and borrows crap from other films. It wasn't interesting in any way whatsoever, and oh man the dialogue was an abomination. It was bland, emotionless and almost like they were reading off a prompt on set. You know what this felt like? It was in part just a rip-off of Terminator 2 without the time travel and SkyNet, except in this case everything was poorly executed.The acting was really, really bad. There was no life at all to these characters, you don't like any of them, and because of that you aren't rooting for anyone. I don't know if ""be dull and boring' was the advice they were given, but if it was then hey, great job guys. The weirdest character has to have been the main heroine, Katia played by Hannah Ware. She had no character arc throughout and wasn't really developed or introduced in any way that explained her abilities. She also has some random sudden personality change late in the film that was out of no-where and made no sense at all. She has no chemistry with Rupert Friend and when half the movie was depending on that, it really showed. In the end this movie was dumb, dull and downright boring. There was no fun, no excitement, the action looked kinda cool and i guess was well choreographed but wasn't entertaining to watch. And to top it all off, it had nothing to do with 'Hitman' so this film is just packed with disappointment for everyone. - 3.2/10",Hitman - Agent 47

I didn't expect it to get good reviews anyways, but there is something about Hit-man Agent 47 that works as a bad movie. It has the potential of becoming the next classic bad movie. If you want to know about the story, all I'll say is that the Contracts agency is there, the character is there, the stealth is sometimes there, sorry I don't know much about the Hit-man games. So yeah I guess they did alright.47 (Rupert Friend) is mostly what I think his character is based on footage of the games I saw, He is mostly stealthy, he uses chords to kill people and changes into costumes, but in the third act, he becomes a this big action hero type of person which is not really what the character is about.What makes this movie so bad it's good, is the crappy dialog, the horrible editing, the silliness of action scenes, and hilarious acting. It all boils down to the point where you cannot take things seriously and becomes unintentionally funny. The movie is fun even though I know it's bad, it's still worth watching though.74/100 B-",Hitman - Agent 47
73,palavitsinis,Really felt like the game!,8,1 September 2015,"Judging the movie within its genre, you may as well say that it's a 9/10! I am a bit reluctant to go that far, as I always keep in mind other movies that may not be in the genre but were great. For me, you can't give a 9 to both hit-man and LOTR. It may as well be that in their genres they're both great, but you just can't put them on the same level overall. As far as the movie is concerned, I really enjoyed the transfer from the game to the big screen. The graphics were all there and some of the movements were really mapped to the game, which brought too many WOW moments for both myself and my brother that watched it with me. We are both fans of the hit-man games and it was a real pleasure to watch this.We were not expecting as much from the movie. We actually wanted to watch the fantastic four but we were advised not to, so we went with the first alternative and were not at all disappointed. We were actually thrilled! The adaptation for the movie was phenomenal and some of the impossible scenes did not seem as implausible as in other movies. They did not throw you out of the movie by making you think ""what a big fat lie!"". It happened once or twice but not more. The lead actor was amazing in his role and it really felt like the real thing. He could have been picked to be a bit more long-faced and with narrow characteristics, more Asian-like, but still he was an excellent fit to what we saw in the game. To address some comments, agent 47 is not a pumped up freak on steroids, he's a silent assassin. Get your facts straight first and then judge. I also liked the lady (which was actually far by a sidekick as some suggested) that played a major role in the movie and that it seems that she will be the main character of the next movie, if one comes out. Nice, quiet, introverted but strong, beautiful as hell but no silicone, gym freak that looks unnatural. Someone that the ladies can relate to, which helps with the female target group of the movie I guess. The plot was OK, again based on what we knew from the game. If you played hit-man, you will adore the movie. It's one of these pleasant flashbacks, bundled into a quality piece of work overall.",Hitman - Agent 47
74,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.,7,10 November 2015,"When it comes to movies based on popular video games, a majority of them intend to fail and get the fanboys of the game source to rave and rant on what's wrong with it and question why it was made. In this scenario, Hit-man: Agent 47 does stand somewhere near there, but it does improve on its 2nd attempt to bring the 'silent assassin' on screen in the best way possible.The film follows an assassin known only as Agent 47 (played by a great and bald Rupert Friend) who seems to team up with a woman named Hanna (Hannah Ware) to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry. Together, they aim to take down the leader of Syndicate International, a terrorist group who is aiming to discover and create more deadly hit-man that process Hannah's unique ability and are more deadly than the assassin himself.What makes Agent 47 so redeemable is the fact that it tries to improve on its plot and following the game source material than what the 2007 adaptation did (not to mention that the casting of Timothy Olyphant is mixed for me), it may not have done its 100% faithfulness to be label how game-to-movies are made but it's better than what most people say. The plot itself stays simple and is a no brainer to follow what's happening, but I did feel that the movie itself ran smoothly and kept pace in strong hold but the 96 minute running time is still considered short for my tastes (hopefully in future there will be an extended cut of the film that could help bring the film longer).The casting range here may or may not seem recognisable but the cast do put on their best performance roles, Rupert Friend (from TV's Homeland) suits better as Agent 47 than what Olyphant's take did. Agent 47 is pretty much an emotionless, ruthless and yet cunning like in the game and Friend sticks close to that with good results. Ware makes a good impression as the female lead, playing a character that is searching for not only her past but embracing the future ahead as she learns more about her 'unique' side. Zachary Quninto plays a decent role as well though other reviewers say that his role was wasted, I won't give away too much but he does give his best on-screen role that's not a waste.Hit-man: Agent 47 is a better but not yet best game to movie adaptation to surface in years, Arming itself with a great choice of casting, direction, plot and action, the film is a worthy watch on a lazy afternoon and it's a 'leave the brain at the door' so you can't take it to be full-on serious.7.5/10 - Nick 6/10 - Jay",Hitman - Agent 47

It feels like a mixture of Terminator/Resident Evil/Matrix films, but only when you take everything what is bad from them 1h 10minutes – the main character is quite likable, even when he doesn't have much in common with 47If I would rate it solely, on how truthfully they have presented agent 47 from the games, the rating would be -4 /10 Terrible from the beginning to the very end, avoid like a poo.tgchan's rating: 4 /10",Hitman - Agent 47
80,djangozelf-12351,Agent 47 would have been a better action flick 10 years ago.,3,22 October 2015,"But in this point in time with the""mission impossible""movies and the""Bourne""trilogy this is a lesser film in form and execution.Some elements have a real B-movie feel and the story relies to much on convenience and bad CGI.Especially the enhanced capabilities came across as ridiculous and done in such a way it kills all tension in those scenes.The choreography seemed to be o.k.but the camera-work ruined most of that and done numerous times before in other flicks.I think they still had some budget issues and the many unexpected returns of the bad guy in this flick is an example of that.And maybe it's me being personal but I really don't like Dubai much as a city and to me it looked like a very wealthy ghost town.Besides that also used better in one of the""mission impossible""movies.Actors actually played poorly and only the father of them both,who only plays in the last 15 minutes,played his part well but the movie is to far gone at that point.Conclusion:you could watch this film sometime on T.V.but I would not pay money to go see it in a cinema.Its just not worth it.Reboot.....again.",Hitman - Agent 47

82,coljam21,Meh..........Alright I guess,6,23 August 2015,"So this is no where as sexy or intense or action packed or filled with tricks as the first Hit Man but it was OK. The guy who plays Agent 47 was is Timothy Olyphant but he was OK. The thin that makes he agents unique is that they're almost like androids. They say little, display no emotion and make no sounds especially grunting when they're fighting.If I remember correctly they'e castrated as boys. I guess someone forgot to tell this director this. Agent 47 had a lot to say and expressed a lot of emotion too. The twist about him and the lead female being siblings was different. Less cliché than them becoming lovers.There was one portion of the film where they were being chases in the red audi and some cables were shot thru the car so hench men could rappel from the roof tops. During that scene all the vehicles surrounding the audi were blue and yellow. It was so bizarre. It's like using a bunch of extras who all wore a yellow rain coat.In all the film was OK.",Hitman - Agent 47

84,kdavies-69347,Another Video Game suffers the Cinematic overhaul,5,3 December 2015,"If you're anything like me, you get really excited when they bring your favorite gaming title to the big screen (personally, I'm still waiting for Zelda). Then there is that moment you think to yourself... ""But what if it sucks?"" Well without ranting away on why video games always suck when they come to cinema (Super Mario Bros, Resident Evil, Doom, Silent Hill, Prince of Persia, Max Payne, Mortal Kombat... actually I loved that one when I was 9), Hit-man unfortunately suffers from the same curse.Let's just look at the film for a moment. First off, the film tries to set up the premise of the whole Hit-man franchise in about... 2 minutes. The problem with the sped up back story is that you have no time to digest this massive amount of plot... I know what you're thinking, ""But they already covered that in the FIRST Hit-man movie with Timothy Olyphant!!!"" Well hold on there a second. These movies are not even related. The plot for the first film in 2007 has nothing to do with this one. The only relationship is the title character with the bar-code tattoo and a murderous skill set. It would have been better just to make THIS movie based on the first 5 minutes of the film. It would have made a much better plot than the rest of this rubbish.Action wise... yeah okay it's cool watching him shoot a bunch of people, but after his 100th kill it's a bit repetitive. 1 shot... 1 kill... repeat... blah.Personally, I think it suffers the same problem as every other video game adaptation. In a game you control what happens, you bond with your characters, and you have to live (or die) by the consequences of your actions. This is just... forcing you to bear witness to a single series of events that are so... FORCEFULLY action-packed that you get bored pretty quick.I suggest dusting off the old ps2, playing the games, and discovering why Agent 47 is such a bad ass. It's his silent kills that make him such a bad ass anyway.",Hitman - Agent 47
85,theemuhammede,A different and new type of agent,8,12 May 2016,"This was not the ordinary Hit-man movie. It took risk by introducing new concepts to the agent program, and it paid off. This would be a great way to start a new series for the Hit-man story.Agent 47 was much more tactical than what was ever shown before. His intelligence is through the roof. His gear is innovative and deadly. But his suit and tie are still the same, and it should be kept that way for future installments to the Hit-man series.But with this movie, there was a different and interesting twist to it. There was a female agent by the name of Katia van Dees, played by Hannah Ware. People are used to seeing a shaved headed male as the hit-man agent, and it was time for change. This gave the story a bit more of an edge to it, and it introduces a new direction for the series. She was much more effective than Agent 47 in every way. Katia did not know it at first, but with 47's help, it was all realized. Katia's speed, intelligence, anticipation, and tactical skills all exceeded that of 47.Many may not like this Hit-man movie because of the introduction to Katia van Dees as an agent, but it provides a new opportunity for viewers to experience something greater instead of the usual and ordinary type of story.",Hitman - Agent 47

For the purposes of the review, I won't divulge the information. ahahaha. But you will be pleasantly surprised. Great ACTION no doubt. A bit too bloody for my liking, however I understand this is part of the Franchise series and the movie is actually based on a VIDEO game. hahaahah.PLOTThe film starts off with explanation of the Agent and how its made. We then are treated to great action of Agent 47. Agent 47 is hunting down Katia who herself is hunting down Litvenenko(Hinds) who we find out that he's her Pappie.

I dont have a favorite scene because the whole movie is insane. Every second was heart pounding and most of the time i yelled WOAH because of the intense action and kills. I hate to say that this is my favorite movie because the terminator 1984 was and will be my favorite movie but i dont really know about that one now. All i can say is wow.

89,brutzel,Every Bit as Good as Timothy Olyphant's Hit-man,9,13 January 2016,"Genetically engineered Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) needs to find Katia (Hannah Ware) the daughter of Dr Litvenkoi (Ciaran Hinds) the creator of these special agents so that she will lead him to her father (Litvenko) who will lead him to bad guy Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) who wants to amass an army of these super agents. Agent 47 needs to insure any program to create these agents is destroyed. This is every bit as good as the Hit-man movie with Timothy Olyphant and that was terrific. Yes, this is based upon a video game, but there is a story in here with many twists. Of course, we like Agent 47 taking out all bad guys and even some good guys (say what?) in a police station. We are intrigued and like the relationship between Agent 47 and Katia, who has a secret within her that she is unaware of. Oh, oh, what could it be? No worries as Agent 47 tells her what that secret is and we are off to the races.. so to speak. Some of the stunts - CGI or otherwise - are simply almost unbelievable: Agent 47's get-a-way car being harpooned (being what?) in a busy city intersection is probably the best one. The stunts throughout do not disappoint and there are many of them. Yeaaaaay! (are you forgetting about the helicopter going through a hi-rise office building windows?)Zachary Quinto does a very good job as John Smith who also needs to find Katia and kill Agent 47. Perhaps the best lines in here: John Smith: "" If you give me what I want, I will leave your daughter in peace."" Litvenko: ""If I give you what you want, there will be no peace.""A nice touch is seeing some very good scenery and buildings in Singapore.A special shout out must go to Rupert Friend. We saw him as CIA Agent Peter Quinn in the TV show Homeland and wondered if he would get a shot at being a James Bond type in the future. We now have our answer: Yeaaaay! He is every bit as good as Timothy Olyphant was in the 2007 Hit-man movie. Kudos. But talk about a special shout-out, we cannot overlook Hannah Ware as Katia. She is beautiful, can act, and can fight too. Hey, she has her moments. You really need to know the secret Agent 47 told her about. Did I give something away? Hmmmdoes not matter. She is fantastic. The very last scenes give us hope for sequels. Yeaaaaay !!! (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Some, not much.",Hitman - Agent 47
90,cheighlee,Actually not that horrible,6,23 November 2015,"I was expecting Terminator - Genysis (Genisys? Genesys? Whatever) level of awfulness and franchise disrespect but in the end, this movie was just a random action movie branded with Hit-man trademark.The main problem of this movie is that it's nothing like Hit-man games and Agent 47 is an action killing machine and not a calculated and resourceful stealth assassin. Yeah, there are hints here and there, but most of the movie was generic shooting everything and everybody with few chasing scenes slapped in for a good measure.But, it has nice set pieces and in the end, it's just an OK action movie, unfortunately marketed as a Hit-man movie. Story is just rushed and not that important, plus - characters are pretty shallow. Although, movie did have some bright moments, brief, but they were there.It's not that bad but it is an ""don't expect much"" action movie. I'm not a huge Hit-man fan but I do have a strong respect for the series and what it did for nonlinear and stealth game play in video games. But even like that I approached this movie as an action movie and nothing more. And in that case it's a flimsy 6, but if you watch it strictly as a hardcore Hit-man movie, then it's 5, maybe even lower, depends on your emotional state of distress at the moment.All that being said, Hit-man is in a bit of a dry place as a franchise these past years. Here, they did laid some groundwork for a sequel but having it that the movie bombed pretty hard at the box office, I doubt we'll see anything like it in a near future. In any case, surprisingly, I don't see this movie as a complete failure and a waste of respectable brand. There are things that can make it better in a potential sequel, be it movie or maybe even better - a TV show continuation from this movie. I guess we'll never know.",Hitman - Agent 47
91,keithlovesmovies,Hit-man: Agent 47 Review,6,23 September 2015,"Genetically engineered from conception through decades of research, a man known only as Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) was made to be a perfect killing machine blessed with unrivaled strength, speed, stamina, and intelligence. His current target is an evil corporation, known as Syndicate International, led by Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) who is looking to uncover 47's past in order to create an army of killers (agents) who are even more powerful than him. With the help of a young woman, Katia (Hannah Ware), he must confront revelations about his own origin and battle against his deadliest foe, John Smith (Zachary Quinto).I'll just start off by saying not to listen to rotten tomatoes on this one. As I am writing this, the film has an 8% rating on the site. You know what also has that rating on the site (also as I am writing this)? The most recent Fantastic Four film does. That film is terrible. This film is no masterpiece but it is a lot better than Fantastic Four. My synopsis above implies that the film has a story but it really doesn't. I'm not sure if they thought they needed to explain anything since the film is based on the video game series of the same name or if they were trying to take its characters and give them a new story. I will admit that I am vaguely familiar with the video game series but you really don't have to be to be able to enjoy this film. This may be because of the running time but to understand what is happening, you must simply accept what you are being told. Luckily there isn't too much of it since the action sequences are at the forefront here. Although very well choreographed, very violent, and exciting, certain aspects defy both sense and reality. What I found unsettling was how bad all of the various henchmen were as they just seemed stupid and died a little too easily. I understand that the filmmakers are supposed to make the stars look good but I would have liked if they could have put up a little more of a challenge. Also, a lot of those sequences contain several instances of bad CGI which took me out of the experience but they panned away from it rather quickly. My favorite part of this film has to be Rupert Friend's performance as Agent 47 because I thought he really embodied what the character would have looked like. I thought Zachary Quinto was good too but he didn't really have too much to do and Kretschmann even less in this one. The real disappointment here is the story (or the lack of) what really seemed promising at the start where it tried to introduce and develop the characters as well as their motivations fell apart around half-way through and became an average, flashy, action movie. The last time I've seen this is in the Ryan Reynolds movie Self/less from a month ago. This film is watchable but I just wanted a little more.Score: 6/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Hitman - Agent 47
92,shinsrevenge,Terminator meets Hit-man meets Next,7,3 August 2016,"A nearly invincible enemy, who can't be defeated by knifes, bullets or car crashes: check. Ability to see into the future to prevent bad decisions: check. Ah yes, there's also Agent 47.With that told let's see what this movie has to offer. A decent amount of action, an okay story, a few nice and surprising plot twists and some almost psychic elements that are too far stretched to be believable.Now I'm not familiar with the world of Hit-man and only saw the first movie from 2007. I appreciate a good action movie. For that we have Agent 47. But the other actress, ""Katia van Dees"" has some really weird and out of place powers. She can see what happens in places beyond her vision or even what's going to happen next.Surprisingly enough I'm not complaining about their antagonist, the Terminator-like John Smith. He has some skin modifications that prevent him for getting severely wounded and even though he can bleed a lot after taking a few bullets in the chest, that won't have him lying down for long. But that's technology, not some kind of psychic foretelling magic.Anyway, Agent 47 helps Katia find an old man. The bad guys are also after him, because he knows how to make Agents (and apparently witches too). There are high speed pursuits, lots of shooting and kills. The usual. I think 7 out of 10 is a fair rating. While it may be far from flawless, it will keep you entertained. Even though it's not as good as the first movie.",Hitman - Agent 47

94,prospectus_capricornium,A Disappointing Miss,5,20 August 2015,"Hit-man: Agent 47 teems with spectacularly choreographed action scenes, so real looking you would think you are actually watching a real video game, like the one the film's based upon. But you can't expect more than that. Outside the territory of its gore explosiveness and visual intensity, stretches bare ground of pure dumbness, of pointless narrative entanglements, that is more often bereft of sense and tension, you probably wouldn't care to follow. It's ironic, really, when the film itself suits itself as a complex one, but barely constructs a coherent storyline to make us drawn and interested. It's an effort to lay groundworks for supposedly incoming conflicts and answers, but the thinly-structured backstories, more often than not, mess up during the process.The narrative is complex. That's probably what first time director, Alexandre Bach, and his team of writers, want to claim. That's one easy thing to justify when you've stuffed your storyline with bunch of needless, if not poorly-structured expositories, but looking at it as a whole, it's basically just about a genetically-engineered assassin trying to stop a malevolent organization from making more killing machines like him. This involves going after a girl named Katia (Hannah Ware), who is actually the daughter of our hero's creator. In pursuit of her, is Agent 47(Rupert Friend), the last and perfect, of his kind, and John Smith (Zachary Quinto) of the international criminal organization, Syndicate International (nope, not the one we heard in Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible). Katia, herself, has been trying to locate her father, and that's exactly the information the 'Syndicate' hopes to get from her, so they could resume creating more of Agent 47's kind, a dream only Katia's father could help them fulfill.Once the adrenaline picks up, deadly cat and mouse chases follow, and explosive breath-takingly executed fight setpieces roll out like dominoes, as if nothing can't stop them.'Hit-man' works fine with this set up, and those who only look for action of such seismic scale, should get satisfied, but for a film that actually seems to aim achievements far beyond just perfectly-choreographed violence and visually explosive setpieces, this film is a misfire.",Hitman - Agent 47

I hate to say it but we're going to have to wait and see how Warcraft turns out to see if a truly great video game movie can be made. I actually enjoyed Hit-man: Agent 47 more than I thought I would but there are some flaws that keep it from being a truly great film. The movie is directed by Aleksander Bach, which is another director without much experience. It feels like we've had a lot of that recently. Honestly, the director wasn't really the problem with this movie but before we get to the negatives let's talk about the story a little bit.The story focuses primarily on two different characters. Agent 47 (Rupert Friend) is a genetically engineered assassin that possesses enhanced senses, speed, and intelligence. All of these traits make him an extremely deadly force to be reckoned with. The other protagonist is a woman named Katia (Hannah Ware). She's looking for a man that she sort of remembers but doesn't know how she remembers him. She gets into the middle of a conspiracy involving a corporation trying to use her to find a scientist to create more super assassins like Agent 47. Fortunately, Agent 47 doesn't want there to be any more experiments like him and begins to train Katia to protect herself and find the mysterious man in her memories.One of the positives that this movie has going for it are the three main characters played by Rupert Friend, Hannah Ware, and Zachary Quinto. Friend plays Agent 47 subtly most of the time. 47 doesn't display emotions like normal people but we see a little spark from him every now and then. Ware does a good job as the determined Katia that starts out scared but eventually turns into a badass warrior woman. Quinto plays an agent named John Smith and I honestly don't want to say too much about his character for fear of spoiling parts of the movie. Fortunately, Quinto rarely disappoints.The action in the movie is actually pretty good and one of the best reasons to give the movie a chance. Agent 47 is ridiculously good at his job and it's interesting to see the crazy things he's capable of. The action is brought to us by the same people that gave us John Wick so it's nice to see some care was put into that part of the movie. However, while the melees and gunfights are pretty good the cgi is noticeably awful in this film. Like, Sy Fy original movie bad. I was kind of struck dumb at points from how fake it looked. The very beginning of the movie had a guy falling off a stairwell and I actually laughed a little from how bizarre and unrealistic it was. Unfortunately, that's not the worst part of the film.The script to this movie is straight up godawful. I mean, the dialogue is just stilted and doesn't come off as genuine at all. There are a lot of scenes that are actually derivative of other movies that came before them. At times, it felt like the movie was trying to copy the coolest or most profound scenes from some of the better films that came before it. The screenwriter is a man named Skip Woods, who's known for giving us such classics as X-Men Origins: Wolverine and the original Hit-man. Hell, one of the major flaws of the original movie was the screenplay but they hired the exact same guy to write another one? I honestly have no idea what they were thinking with that decision.The movie has some stupid plot holes and some very poor dialogue but it's still fun nonetheless. If you feel like shutting off your brain for a little while then this will be a decent way to spend an hour and a half. If you're looking for the next best action franchise then this isn't it. I was hopeful the movie would be great but I'm honestly not surprised it isn't. This is a video game movie after all. I'm curious to hear some other opinions about the film. Are there any fans of the video games that enjoyed the film? I'm curious how closely it follows the games actually.",Hitman - Agent 47

102,loevw,It is what an action movie should be,8,19 December 2015,"Ever since I have seen the Matrix, which is my favourite movie of all time, I don't expect much from action films, and keep my bar relatively low, except for Marvel movies.

People are always bound to be disappointed when they try to compare books or games to films.I don't expect an action movie to be believable, or to have a great plot. I just want a confident character with superior fighting skills who takes out the bad guys, and a little bit of ""what's going to happen next?"" even if I can guess most of the time.So if you are an action fan like me, ignore what everyone is saying and watch this movie.

103,sedativchunk,Enjoyable popcorn flick for Hit-man fans,7,4 September 2015,"I am a huge fan of the Hit-man video games and have been playing the games for several years. I could resist but to give this movie a shot because I simply love the Hit-man franchise and will support anything they put out there. The positives - this movie hit the nail on the head perfectly in some areas. Hit-man really looked like ""hitman"" at times. The lead actor I found to be a fine choice for agent 47 and had that kind of creepy look to him like in the games. And the moves, costume changes, props (including the silverballers and fiber wire) were well demonstrated. Some parts of the movie very accurately portrayed the behavior and attitude of Agent 47 based off his video game persona. I also have to say that in general, the movie was also well directed/produced with no major flaws and it fell like a well- budgeted film.The negatives - first, the action sequences were a bit over the top. Being a fan of the video games, Hit-man was always a stealthy assassin. But this movie turned him into some gun-and-gun super soldier at times. Some parts of the film they did so right but then others they got a bit carried away with. There were definitely one too many car chase scenes (with some obvious Audi product placement...). If my memory serves me correct, not one time did you ever drive a car in the Hit-man games. Hit-man was always a character that went for his contract, kill who needed to be killed, and leave with a clean job. This movie is polar opposite of that. Besides the action, the story, although passable, felt very generic. Final verdict - I would say this movie is average at best, a 7/10. Part of my wants to like it more, but I felt like I wanted more out of this film. Also, I have to say if you are NOT a fan of the video games, well, I can't see you liking this movie too much, not compared to more superior films of it's style. With that being said, I did enjoy it and I would love to see a sequel made. I think if they continue the story things could get more interesting and better developed with this reboot.",Hitman - Agent 47

It's not going to win Oscars or make your Top 10 list, but it IS going to make you smile and go ""Whoa!"" Car chases, fight scenes, and ""gun fu"" as Keanu Reeves calls it - Hitman: Agent 47 has everything to be your guilty pleasure movie of the week.A clear upgrade from 2007's Hitman, this movie embraces its video game roots while still successfully transferring its action material to the cinema. Rupert Friend's performance (and Zachary Quinto's if I'm
being honest) is pretty flat, but it's worth mentioning that Hannah Ware actually has a solid showing. She feels like a video game version of Beckinsale's Selene from the Underworld seriesLook, it's good 'ol trashy ""run & gun"" fun.

106,imdb-23821,"A fun, mindless action film, far better than rated",7,26 August 2021,"The film has a good cast - and if you don't care about the game or any association directly with any previous story line, it's actually a far better movie than the sum of its parts. In short, Katia is searching for a mystery man. She has spent her life hiding but possessing extraordinary senses of awareness. Two men are following her but appear to have different reasons for coming after her. Who is telling the truth?Some of the film is a bit unrealistic - to say the least - and will remind you of Equilibrium if you've seen the movie. But the effects are good, the action scenes are excellent, a good and reasonably well edited vehicle chase and reasonably likeable characters who do a very good job with this action film.I gave it a little better rating than I would normally do, disappointed at the poor ratings that exist for a film that really doesn't deserve to be upper 5s. I'd say it's a solid 6, worthy of a fun watch, and perhaps I enjoyed it a little more as an escape.",Hitman - Agent 47
107,baberchik,what hit-man? What 47?,3,11 September 2015,"My first major issue: what on earth does this movie have to do with Agent 47 or the entire Hit-man franchise, besides (obviously) the ""hitman"", who is similar in some parts of his appearance only? Besides him there is really only 2 characters that can be linked to the game; that is the ""father"" (who died in the first Hit-man game, hence a major plot hole) and who I can only guess is Diana, though she plays a completely insignificant part. All in all the storyline completely alien, there's really not much to add to that. So if you for some reason are interested to see any resemblance of the actual game just forget it, big movie fat cats decided to spew out another completely irrelevant movie.My second major issue is the sci-fi part; the ""hitman"" can, apparently, see trough walls, sense people from a distance, see the future etc. What???? Is this Star Wars? Does he use the force or something? Why not just add light sabres and Bobba Fett just the same, would literally not spoil the movie and not sidetrack it, like at all! Also if you have watched Equilibrium you will see a lot of so called ""gun kata"" ripoff scenes, almost directly lifted from that movie.Third issue: this is an action movie, pure and simple. Something along the lines of Transporter and the Bourne franchise, so if you like that action/thriller genre, by all means this movie is a blast. But then why call it ""hitman"" if the game is about not some superman but an incredibly cunning character, who uses lots of stealth, is by no means immortal, and chooses his fights very carefully and does (Hint, hint! The name!) a lot of Assassinations! And the game was pretty much aimed at making the player being the best assassin possible; ie sneak, kill target only, leave everyone else preferably unhurt and clueless, not go in guns blazing... because that would cost you dearly.Sorry but this time, yet again, as Hollwood has already sharpened its axe with many encounters with various novels, this time they beheaded a game franchise with it. Now I can only guess why they did it, most likely a complete vacuum of new ideas, but given the fact that games a very.... very... very hard to translate into movies without the final product being too cheesy or completely ""off topic"", they should have picked something different.This movie is just another nail in the coffin for cinema that engages the viewer, rather, it is a prime example of a fast-food version of cinema; quick, very simple, and made for the masses the same way as livestock feed is. It is no fine dining for the grey matter, that's for sure. And lastly I would like to say that though I am always looking forward to games made into movies, crossing my fingers so hard they almost snap at the joints, 90% of the time it ends as a huge letdown. One game though, ""hitman: contracts"" could be made into an epic film noire / slasher / thriller combo, but would require and extremely good script writer, and an even more talented director, and now that there's been two Hit-man movies and both are complete s***, this option is perhaps reserved for an alternate universe where Hollywood is not the cinema version of McDonalds.",Hitman - Agent 47
108,idanvinter123,"First play the games, then watch this pile of garbage",1,29 October 2015,"Let me say for the record that I finished Hit-man: Absolution twice, one of my favorite games ever. This movie ''adaptation'' is an absolute garbage.I saw a few people saying they never played the games, and they enjoyed the movie. Well, if you would've play the damn games, you'll know why this game is god awful.Let's begin by saying that the only real similarity between the movie and the games is that they both feature an assassin named Agent 47. That's how bad of a movie it is. Other than that, this movie is confusing, stupid, boring, truly awful and barely an adaptation. Now let's start the rant:The action scenes are boring, the performances are below average, you barely know 3 of the whole cast in this movie, so many plot points (the only truly amazing thing in this trash), so many stupid and unnecessary slow-mo sequences, a truly horrible awful plot twist and let's not forget my main issue with this trash (it's not a movie, it's trash)- you get absolutely NO BACKGROUND story of Agent 47 and the even worse part is that all the kills Agent 47 does are in no way silent. You only see him put on a silencer in his gun ONCE throughout the whole trash. JUST. ONCE.This film is truly a betrayal of the original games, it doesn't do any justice to the games, every scene films awful and fake, and like I said before- the plot twist is so awful and makes you wonder what the hell did you just see.This is probably one of the worst video-game-inspired films. This film is useless, worthless, doesn't make any sense AT ALL, confusing, bad action sequences, and please don't give this film your money. please.Other than that, hope you have a nice day, and don't even think about watching this trash- even if you play every Hit-man game, and even if you didn't play any of the games.",Hitman - Agent 47
109,xristoff93,An action movie with a hit-man look alike,5,28 August 2016,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie since I watched the trailer.But I will not get into any details on that,let's go directly to the movie.To us,fans of hit-man,the title actually means something.When I read or expect to watch something about hit-man I expect a super trained assassin with no ethical code.A super killer,silent and precise,always hiding and leaving no clues behind.What we get here is nothing like that.There are a lot of gunfire scenes,explosions,talks between hit- man and his victims before he kills them and the agent himself is a product of genetic alterations that leave him ""heartless"".The thing that fascinated me more about hit-man is that he acquired his assassin identity through a series of hard training and psychological tests since he was a child in order to be made different from a normal person concerning feelings and way of thinking.Here he is just a lab product.He is smart and precise and changes costumes,which was a nice touch but the constant car chases,gun-fires and high level destruction of surroundings makes it a totally different thing from Agent 47.I didn't like the fact that we get to see Diana and she is presented to us like a total nobody.I didn't like the fact that besides being genetically programmed out of emotion,we see him act on a different manner.So,we have plot holes even for the newly established hit-man set.His ""sister"" was a bit indifferent and his rival looked like a middle aged stud that you can tell he's a total asshole just from the way he makes his hair.Not manly at all.And besides all that bloodshed we do not see him actually die...That was disappointing.In the end hit-man defies Diana,who has already decided to get rid of him since the operative sent to kill him arrived just after 47 made it clear he wouldn't bide by the contract.Another huge plot hole is in the fact that his ""sister"" after some focusing alone,becomes a super killing machine,while she is supposed to have only heightened senses.The end scene was a fail.A 47 clone appears,agent 48 ordered to kill 47 and Katia.They look exactly the same and while you would expect another great dual or fight between the 3,you only get a few seconds of cheesiness with the awful line""Diana sends her regards"" or something.I wonder if she watched the ""red wedding"" when Lannisters ""sent their regards"" before saying that.The foes shoot at each other and that's it....Bad ending.All in all we get a relatively nice action packed movie with a lot of killing,high technology,some important plot holes,a bit of emotionless characters-but they are supposed to be some kind of cold blooded hybrids,so you can't expect a lot of feeling anyway-car chases and explosions,which is,as I said,kinda nice.....but not Hit- man.......If you expect something close to the game you will be disappointed.I give it a 4 as hit-man and a 5.5 as an action movie....so 5/10 seems appropriate.",Hitman - Agent 47

111,nick-sultana,A Better Attempt But Not Quite There,6,23 August 2015,"When it comes to movies based on popular videogames, a majority of them intend to fail and get the fanboys of the game source to rave and rant on what's wrong with it and question why it was made. In this scenario, Hit-man: Agent 47 does stand somewhere near there, but it does improve on its 2nd attempt to bring the 'silent assassin' on screen in the best way possible.The film follows an assassin known only as Agent 47 (played by a great and bald Rupert Friend) who seems to team up with a woman named Hanna (Hannah Ware) to help her find her father and uncover the mysteries of her ancestry. Together, they aim to take down the leader of Syndicate International, a terrorist group who is aiming to discover and create more deadly hit-man that process Hannah's unique ability and are more deadly than the assassin himself.What makes Agent 47 so redeemable is the fact that it tries to improve on its plot and following the game source material than what the 2007 adaptation did (not to mention that the casting of Timothy Olyphant is mixed for me), it may not have done its 100% faithfulness to be label how game-to-movies are made but it's better than what most people say. The plot itself stays simple and is a no brainer to follow what's happening, but I did feel that the movie itself ran smoothly and kept pace in strong hold but the 96 minute running time is still considered short for my tastes (hopefully in future there will be an extended cut of the film that could help bring the film longer).The casting range here may or may not seem recognisable but the cast do put on their best performance roles, Rupert Friend (from TV's Homeland) suits better as Agent 47 than what Olyphant's take did. Agent 47 is pretty much an emotionless, ruthless and yet cunning like in the game and Friend sticks close to that with good results. Ware makes a good impression as the female lead, playing a character that is searching for not only her past but embracing the future ahead as she learns more about her 'unique' side. Zachary Quninto plays a decent role as well though other reviewers say that his role was wasted, I won't give away too much but he does give his best on-screen role that's not a waste.Pros: + Better plot than the previous film + Great performances from Friend, Ware and Quinto + Fun and well-set action pieces that are structured much well better than the first filmCons: - Short running time, I would have loved to seen the film go longer and see itself expand into something unique- CGI may be clearly noticeable in some of the action set pieces OVERALL: Hit-man: Agent 47 is a better but not yet best game to movie adaptation to surface in years, Arming itself with a great choice of casting, direction, plot and action, the film is a worthy watch on a lazy afternoon and it's a 'leave the brain at the door' so you can't take it to be full-on serious.",Hitman - Agent 47
112,ericzillazillo,"Nonsense ethics, bad guy clichés, clean action",7,8 January 2016,"Hit-man is about a bio-engineered hit-man who... what? Look. There are problems with the film's storyline. In the beginning, it bears too much resemblance to a video game where there is literally a tutorial mission (sorry, I mean ""scene"").Then the film commits what I view as the cardinal sin of having supposedly intelligent bad guys do stupid things, although they do try to justify it with ""duh arrogance"".However, the action in this movie is fantastic, and ultimately that is the context this movie should be viewed in. Within the context of bioengineered killers, I am absolutely delighted with the precise (though obviously choreographed) shooting where superhuman shooters dispatch of their enemies cleanly, never missing their shot - which is what I EXPECT to happen if you're telling me some guy is a highly trained magical cyborg unicorn enhanced murderer.Given that the film is based on a video game, the action happening is consistent with the rules of the universe - no bullet feels unaccounted for by the film-makers.Where the film really falls short is its discussion of ethics. Bioengineering killers for profit is wrong, obviously, because both greed and murder are wrong. However, while the film manages to depict engineered superhuman abilities as being sometimes worthwhile to have, the dialogue never once considers the possibility that enhancing ordinary people may not be such a bad idea.Oh yeah, also, ******* Audi product placements. Still overall if you like it when a supposedly perfect killer actually performs perfectly, this is the film to see.",Hitman - Agent 47

115,inc-133-70013,Oh god.,2,26 August 2015,"How many critics does it take for Skip Woods to actually get off his bum and play the damn game? Do we really have to wait until current generation players grow up and magically happen to become script writers? Who would remember the game by then? Just because you have a scene from 2nd game box cover doesn't make it legit.For this movie, I didn't care what professional critics said: they don't play Hit-man games so their opinion doesn't count. I went to see this and discovered that neither do people who made this waste of time and millions of dollars.Some say that Hit-man just isn't the kind of game that translates to a movie, that it's all about player choice and playing it yourself. I don't believe that either. Hit-man - the game series has motifs that you rarely see even in best movies. That's what's the game really about. Let me name some:* Shady world behind the curtains of rich and famous. In games, you often explore what powerful persons do when they think they're not watched. A fetish-induced ""meat party"" in abandoned slaughterhouse in Eastern Europe. The villa of south-American drug lord. The mansion of powerful British aristocrats. A shady meeting in a Vegas Casino. A rocker's bar in Rotterdam and it's basement. A rehab center for celebrities. And so on... Those themes alone could fill any movie with times more material and exotic sets than boring sky shots of modern capitols (that seem to be in every movie lately) and parking garages, which seem to be most popular place for shootings to happen.* Hit-man always enters ongoing life, it doesn't revolve around him. In games, Hit-man makes use of what people do around him, that's what helps him to blend in and truly be Silent Assassin. A love affair in the White House. Noise of the Chinese market. Police discovering hippie commune and raiding it, while having no idea Hit-man is nearby. SWAT team preparing to raid a ship... In this movie, nothing of sort exists. Whole world seems to be revolving around the conflict of main characters and there's even no police to distract them, let alone normal civilians who would have no idea whatsoever.* Sudden turn of normality. What makes Hit-man games absolutely great is that everything seems to be normal most of the time. Hit-man steals a disguise, blends into crowd, walks around in a french theatre, The White House, an embassy, a strip club, Chinese restaurant, snowy streets of St. Petersburg or wherever and it's very casual. Until... SHOCK! someone's being choked to death, dumped into garbage bin, injected with poison, suffocated in sauna.... aaand then it's suddenly all normal again. He changes disguise and keeps on walking. No one even noticed that a murder has been committed.THIS is what I would expect from a Hit-man movie. Think it wouldn't make a decent movie?Nothing, nothing of the sort is in this movie. It's a simple, cookie-cutter, ""we're sorry"" script for your typical Van Damme movie. And that's all that's to be said.",Hitman - Agent 47

And as I said, It is definitely not a perfect action movie, it was just OK. Perfect for a late night watch and I would definitely not call it a waste of time.

I am assuming the people who have made the Hit-man movies never actually played the game, or chose to use the tired Hollywood formula instead of creating a worthy adaptation! In the game, 47 is a cold-blooded ruthless assassin without feelings or morals. He receives his assignments and executes them flawlessly. He doesn't warm up to clichéd female characters, he doesn't attempt to justify why he is doing what he does, and he doesn't carry human baggage. He is supposed to be stealthy, sneaky, and efficient. Instead, Hollywood attempts to make him the Jason Bourne of the assassin world, which strays too far from the source material. Until Hollywood realizes that not EVERY movie has to contain an empowered female character and a moral justification for the anti-hero's actions -- we will continue to get substandard productions such as this. This movie has its entertaining moments, but fall far short of being an actual Hit-man film and ends up being a mindless B-Movie at best.",Hitman - Agent 47

It has been put together very well. And while the content isn't that packed, it tells the story well.In all a nice movie with a slower pace, less packed story line with nice sequences. Good acting and visually easy to absorb and enjoy.Spoiler alert: For me personally, agent 47 could've been cast better. I do get the whole ""human love wins"" and ""family above all"". Yet, somehow the agent wasn't that bad-ass. While it seemed a competition of who was ""better"" with women again being ""the best by factor x"". (felt a bit like obligatory female superior quota.)The movie does open up for a more long winded series, with two lead characters appealing to women and men.

I have absolutely no interest in the idea of a movie spawned from a video game, in my experience that's a fools errand. I can count the number of watchable game/movies I've seen on one hand, and could fill a car boot with the ones I've seen that were execrable cr*p. Thankfully 'Hitman 47' is part of the former group.It's fun, fast-paced, full of great action sequences, car chases, fights and sh*t getting blown up in public places. It has great locations and some humour. Zachary Quinto is awesome and more than a bit creepy - especially starting out as he does seeming like the romantic hero - and Hannah Ware isn't too dusty either. Rupert Friend however is superbly watchable as 47. Physically beautiful and superbly kickass, he gives the character of 47 a subtle undercurrent of pathos that allows you to actually give a toss, despite his seeming lack of personality. I watched 'Spectre' a few days before I saw this and am amazed at how this, far smaller and less explosive movie managed to succeed in ways that the mighty Bond franchise entirely fell down, number one being the fact that it was entertaining without being insanely misogynistic.It's no 'Bourne Identity' but it's a fun pacey action movie for when you're in the mood for just such fare.

Like walking a musical path, and only the most striking essentials remain. But even tropes can fade amid time and other in-between.Then there are the homages, with basing around a given quest; take Kingsman:The Secret Service , topped with Samuel L. Jackson's acknowledgment of the world's most famous spy's work. And so his action heroes in S.W.A.T.—for sequels that spell ruin. Besides offering recommendations, acknowledging or drawing from does not always mean good. Only enlightening on the influence.Be that as it may, Hit-man: Agent 47 is a cut from the spy cloth, harboring every action and trodden grounds. Tech is incorporated to the likeliest minimum, laudably for a realistic parallel to an actual spy. The plot point jags with some pregnant reticent idea espousal that turns only on narration. Culling all expectations of integrated and extended bio-warfare It is the results of the biological engineering and the scientific instigator, as persons, that the plot proceeds to encapsulate. Succintness allows unfolding to explain themselves away, because not every narration ensconces itself satisfactorily —more so when adapting stories. Trifle make or break matters. Professional spies are the closest a mortal could get to a superhuman. An edge that makes them able to conquer the inhuman villains, or similar, if challenging agents. With the generic evil corporation — whose logo and name required the least effort — that wants a political overhaul. Hook or crook. First. All else is left to the lead and supporting agents whose performances fail to be captivating. Not even a star cast saves the damn day. Here is where a joke or two could have lightened motions up a little. A Mission: Impossible complex plot is not what would make this hit either, although the romance that burdens many features as a setting for plot tensions has been done away with.Despite all, this might make for a good runaway sequel, should the narrated idea be put into provoking, neat, expansive consideration.

However, I must say I was pleasantly surprised, as this was a well-made and enjoyable, if a little bland, action-thriller with solid directing and an excellent cast. The plot, following Katia (Hannah Ware) in the search for her long-lost father in the midst of a war between rival mercenary factions, is well-paced and scripted, with a nice balance between action and character moments. Said action is shot and edited quite well, and does a good-job capturing the mixture of martial arts, gunplay, and stealth from the games. Rupert Friend was great as the ice-cold Agent 47, showing only hints of emotion here and there, and Hannah Ware as Katia felt like an actual character and not baggage. Zachary Quinto was effective, if a bit hammy, as villain John Smith/Mark Parchezzi, though I could have gone for less of his cheesy one-liners.

I don't give anything away in this review, the only spoiler is a plot hole that i mention near the end, which doesn't ruin the story.Im a pros and cons kind of guy, so:Pros: Action was sometimes very cool and some fight scenes were well done The acting was above averageCons: Pacing was all over the place, it was be very fast paces and then dead, like falling asleep slow Many plot holes, such as when 47 gets ""shot"" at the end, and they brush it off like nothing happened Story was pretty messyI did not really enjoy the first Hit-man, and was looking forward to a better film this time around. I did enjoy this one better, but not by much. They tried to make it more sneaky and intelligence over action, but it falls flat on its face with some pretty bad CGI during the action shotsSo probably not worth the admission price, but many if you see it on TV and are bored, you can give it a watch, but it might put you to sleep",Hitman - Agent 47
129,peggyatthemovies,Hit-man: Agent 47 - hit or miss?,5,21 August 2015,"The stunning Rupert Friend explodes onto the screen here as ""Agent 47"" – one of a numbered group of genetically DNA engineered 'Hitman' from the popular video game giving a second try at a film franchise here. Hannah Ware plays Katia van Dees, the daughter of a missing scientist Dr. Litvenko (Ciarán Hinds) who back in the 1960's was responsible for creating a super-soldier program that brought Agent 47, and at least 46 other deadly assassins into the world. Syndicate International, one of those typical diabolical organizations that always seem to exist, run by Le Clerq (Thomas Kretschmann) wants Katia's father as they think he holds the secrets to making more. Agent 47's employers want her dead.Zachary Quinto's aptly named character John Smith – who's name pun you will understand when watching.. seems not to really fit his part in the beginning..after a few decent plot twists in his favour he turns it around and pulls his character off. He after all is also an 'agent' in a sense with a pretty neat change up of DNA in him.Along with a bland storyline and too many plot holes to count or even care about, the films plus side is in if there is one demographic that it would try to please, it's obvious that aim is for 15-20 yr olds video-gamers who live for hours stepping into this world of CGI-done assassins killing off his enemies while wreaking maximum havoc in the process. And oh..the blood looks good. I'm serious it really does. Friend as Agent 47, is a killing machine fighting other killing machines with whom I'd thought that we'd seen every imaginable killing stunt – but this film truly does become imaginative in that area and comes up with some doozies I'd think the likes of us haven't even dreamed up.In the end, we do have a few surprise twists but there is no spark of life is to be found in a few of the characters most disappointingly in Ware, whose Katia is meant to be the supposed emotional linchpin of the enterprise. We've seen Friend do the cold and calculating before as Peter Quinn on Homeland where he actually scares us at times. The same goes here, American accent included. They have a few moments of mild playfulness mostly that Friend tries half heartedly to inject in their partnership without much success.And of course what would the ending be if not to give us a little after name credits roll – scene of what is to come. And for the third time in a month, I'm seeing in that teaser scene what will probably be a better sequel than original.End note: Paul Walker was scheduled to play Agent 47 and due to his untimely and tragic passing, Rupert Friend stepped in.

132,starsmark-1,I Love This Movie,10,30 March 2017,"I don't understand why this movie received so many bad reviews. Perhaps the film deviates from the comics and computer game it's supposed to be based on, neither of which I am familiar with.All the actors gave excellent performances. I was especially impressed by Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware.I saw this movie for the first time on TV and then bought the DVD for my collection. It's a great action/adventure/mystery/thriller film. I love how the two main characters progress from beginning to end. They were not what I expected and I was delighted.I really hope there is a sequel to this film (hurry, please!) and that both Rupert Friend and Hannah Ware reprise their roles.Very entertaining and enjoyable film!!",Hitman - Agent 47

Hope to see more of her in the future. She did well here. Good casting call. Pretty much all were right on the money. Action scenes were cool. Story leads to more movies , which I look forward to as long as they bring back the two main characters/actors. They worked well together. I actually watched it a couple of times already.

134,WaltWiz,A new kind of bad,3,9 April 2016,"This movie will infuriate Hit-man fans and disappoint everyone else. First of all, it's not about Agent 47, it is about a girl who could, like, wipe the floor with 47, and he is only helping her discover her potential like some Italian suit-wearing Hagrid. Look, I don't have anything against girl power movies, but why did this have to be one? 47 is not a girl, and if you are making a movie about a girl, why does the title imply otherwise? This bait-and-switch will annoy the viewer regardless of his relationship with the Hit-man franchise, as will the clichés the movie bombards you with. There are moments Hit-man fans will appreciate, like when 47 wears disguises or anticipates the enemies' movements and uses the environment against them; during those moments, the movie feels the way it is supposed to feel, but they are only moments. One of those moments, though, is what lowers the movie to a whole different level. I am talking about the appearance of Agent 48, who looks EXACTLY like the protagonist is supposed to look, except that you see him for about ten seconds, right before the credits roll. I have seen some bad films, but this is the first one that consciously and deliberately gives its viewers the finger. I see no other way to interpret that scene, it is just a giant FU to the audience. Basically, they are saying, ""We know exactly what you came to see. Don't think we didn't know any better. We did, we just chose to show you something entirely different because f**k you."" I can't begin to imagine the motives behind that gesture, but I certainly do not appreciate it.",Hitman - Agent 47

He was actually incredible. All the actors were great.Watch it as an action movie, or as a version of the game and you'll love every minute.I hope they make many more!",Hitman - Agent 47
136,wjets9,"Ignore the Ratings, See This Movie",8,17 September 2015,"I had an absolute blast watching this movie.Now first things first, I've never played any of the Hit-man video games. That being said, I went to see this film with a friend who's a big fan of them, and he thoroughly enjoyed all the references and call backs to the game. But since I have never played them, this review will be written with zero background on the game.The basic story is this: there was an old program that created ""agents"". These agents are essentially killing machines. The creator has gone underground and disappeared so as to not have to create anymore. While both the agents and the company that he left try to find him before the other does. The one connection to him is his daughter, who has also gone underground, but has recently been found. Enter Agent 47 and John Smith. Both try to out whit the other and a battle ensues for all.The casting for this movie is very adequate. Zachary Quinto has always been my second favorite actor since I watched Heroes, and he is incredible as the villain that he plays. Rupert Friend plays a role which doesn't require very much range in his acting, but he does it well. Hannah Ware starts the movie a bit shaky, but she grows into her role as it progresses. The special effects are phenomenal and the fight and car chase scenes are all entertaining.Overall I give this movie an 8/10 and leave everybody with the recommendation to watch it, it's a good time.",Hitman - Agent 47
137,sdfnhwpfwgwlgv,not even average,2,16 December 2015,"First of all: the movie has very very little in common with the game. Above all: where are the scenes which contain the MAIN idea of the game: dress up as another person and walk through security areas being unrecognized? There is one scene which is about 10 seconds long, that's all. If you played Hit-man: Codename 47 then you have a completely different atmosphere in the game than in this movie.I played all Hit-man games and would really wish that some director would make a Hit-man movie worth this legendary game-series. Nothing about this movie is even average. I am honestly speechless... maybe after some beer this movie might be watchable as a standalone trash-movie, thats all. Well, i think it's time to listen now to the real Hitman:Codename47 soundtrack in order to shake away all this 96-min.-disappointment",Hitman - Agent 47

It has good action scenes and to me the ideas for how the characters see things I found innovative and pretty cool. Good cast. Good acting. Caught stuff the second time I watched it which made the story make more sense. Its like any movie translating from a book. There are changes, but unlike video games, books are much more indept with the details. I feel like video game movies get more freedom because it doesn't have as much development.",Hitman - Agent 47
139,Prophet89,High potential of the franchise utterly wasted,4,24 January 2016,"When I saw the first Hit-man movie, I thought it was quite a ridiculous attempt at transforming a high success video game to big screen. And then this came around. I mean, god damn, I gave it 4 out of 10 for Rupert Friend alone, because I absolutely loved the guy in Homeland. This movie is an insult to the source material. I mean I REALLY wouldn't force the director, writer and/or main character actor to go through even one of the games, but why, why on earth wouldn't they at least have read the script? I mean, movie people do realize, that games have scripts as well, don't they? In short words, instead of making kind of a suspense thriller (genre to which hit-man games could be compared) about a genetically modified assassin made in an insane attempt at cloning people in an insane *pun intended* asylum in Romania, they made a mediocre, at best, action flick with so bad writing that even decent actors can't help it.Also, to the producers, next time you want a heavy cgi'd movie, make it's budget bigger OR try to minimize the CGI. Like, one of the two. Because this movie here is something that seems like it tried to rip off one of the newer James Bond flicks but it fell short like, well, a cheap rip-off.It was quite unnerving, seeing Friend play in this, I hope he at least made a decent coin out of it, because it's not gonna be a bright point in his resume.",Hitman - Agent 47

141,BigNadz89,Hit-man: Agent 90 - Judgement Day,7,15 September 2015,"He is out there! he can't be bargained with. He can't be reasoned with. He doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And he absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.I am of course talking about the Termina...... Hit-man! After Fox had their pathetic attempt at cashing in on a popular video game franchise and failing terribly. They figured ""hey! why not have another go"" and decided they needed to do something different. So naturally they came up with this pathetic attempt at cashing in on a popular video game franchise, and surprisingly failed terribly at it once again.Not only does this film shamelessly steal plot points from the Terminator movie series, but it also follows the Terminator tradition of spoiling key plots of the film in the trailer.We have the awesome Rupert ""Jack Bauer of Homeland"" Friend playing the lead role as the unstoppable killing machine; Hit-man: Agent 47. Zachary ""who is junglejim4322@yahoo.com?"" Quinto playing Kyle Reese....Sorry I mean John Connor....wait no I mean John Smith....Or is it Brian? Oh who cares. Moving on, we have the lovely Hannah Ware playing Katia ""Not a Sarah Connor rip off"" Van DeezNuts.Let's get to the story! The story is about the Agent T4700, who hunts this woman because he is apparently trying to kill her for some reason. Luckily for her she has Zachary Quinto who has been sent to save her from this unstoppable killing machine. However, brace yourself for a twist that you will never see coming (unless if you've seen the trailer) The woman in question is Katia. A normal girl living in Berlin who for some reason has heightened senses and is obsessed with finding an old man, she doesn't know why though (you'll probably figure out where this storyline is going assuming you haven't suffered a severe head injury, or destroyed your brain cells due to heavy drug usage) She meets the charming John Smith who gives her a paraphrased version of the speech that Kyle Reese gives Sarah Connor in Terminator (but that's homage people! not plagiarism, so keep your pants on for Gods sake!) The Hit-man arrives promptly and all hell breaks loose. He tries to kill them but he naturally fails. Then the twists start to happen. I shall not go into them because if you've seen the trailer then you've seen half of the movie anyway. The film should really be called Hit-man Agent90 featuring Agent47. It's hardly about him and his story (or even being a Hit-man in general) but him training this girl on how to survive. If this film was called Guardian47 then that would be alright, but it's not. It's called Hit-man, so it should be about him being a contracted killer (which he is, but not for the most part) There is one scene that I ""enjoyed"" (it's not a spoiler, it's in the trailer!) There is a scene when Hit-man is being interrogated, and the cop in charge brings his confiscated Sniper Rifle into the interrogation room. Now that scene has to be one of the worst written scenes ever, there is absolutely no logic in doing that. What was his plan? To threaten Hit-man at gunpoint? It was just a silly plot just so Hit-man can have his guns in the room when he needs them.The action scenes are decent, definitely an improvement over the action in the previous turd that the studio churned out. They find new creative ways of killing people which is keeping in the spirit of the Hit-man games. The acting (other than Terminators and Sylars) is pretty crap. The soundtrack was decent though.Does the film deliver? It has plenty homages to the video games. The action is sufficient, and in the same style as the games.That being said, it was a somewhat enjoyable movie (in a turn your brain off and enjoy this popcorn flick way) with a story that should keep you interested for the most part. Action that you should enjoy and some nipple pokies thrown in for good measure.",Hitman - Agent 47

While the films are based on Edios' video game series, Hit-man: Agent 47 (2015) is another story featuring the cue-bald assassin who is assigned to terminate a woman who has the ability to see the future (even the past) and another agent starts to go after them. This may sounded like another Terminator-like retelling while the action being the main highlight as for the rest I didn't cared much.

151,It_Is_Minus_9,"Hit-man: Agent 47 is the Ambien of movies, a cinematic sleep-aid if ever there was one.",2,30 August 2015,"Wow. Looks like Fox is keeping its interns busy with posting dummy reviews for this movie, praising it with 10's, calling it the best movie ever made, and dissing its critics. Well, I don't work for Fox. I just like movies that don't put me to sleep. And, well, Hit-man: Agent 47 is the Ambien of movies, a cinematic sleep-aid if ever there was one.A generic story with generic characters, and worst of all, generic action. Maybe the director is to blame -or Skip Woods; who the hell keeps hiring this hack anyway?- but the action too often relies on repetitive gunfights and cheap-looking CGI bodies falling and hitting the floor. Even the big car stunt they replay in all the TV spots over and over again --with the grappling hooks trapping the car in broad daylight-- falls flat the minute Agent 47 starts firing on generic bad guy after generic bad guy. It turns into the same cheap sequence we've already seen twenty times before.As for Rupert Friend, he's forgettable with a kind of limp calm in his performance that borders on non-existent. It doesn't help that the story doesn't know what it wants out of his character so it rips off far better movies in trying to give him any depth or make him remotely interesting. Terminator 2? Yep! Just like Cameron did with Arnie chasing John Connor, the filmmakers here try and make the audience think 47 is evil and then we're supposed to gasp in shock when he's revealed to be the good guy trying to save a mysterious woman named 'Katia.' The real shocker: the fact that this movie plays this like a big reveal when it's so obvious, Fox's marketing gave it away in the trailers.And here is the movie's biggest problem: Katia. Her Agent gene, the thing making her capable of all these amazing supernatural physical feats, is wildly inconsistent. First, we're shown she can untie herself from a series of intricate knots before getting sucked into a jet engine. But a few scenes later, she's incapable of untying her wrists from a simple knot when she's tied up in a helicopter. Did they suddenly forget the abilities they literally just established for her?! How about when she's able to evade a thousand security cameras in the airport, but gets caught on camera the moment she steps outside? Or, after a lifetime of civilian life, she's suddenly able to fire weapons and kung-fu fight just as well as Agent 47 because the movie needs her to suddenly do this? Thankfully, Skip Woods doesn't trash the other characters as badly. Quinto's 'John Smith' is fun, and the movie's only bright spot. A mid-movie reveal of his character's invincibility --this due to a gleefully stupid-sounding 'sub-dermal body armor'-- was a welcome twist in an otherwise boring film and the type of dumb fun I expect from this type of pulpy action movie.Too bad the rest of the movie doesn't follow suit.Here's hoping the next time they make a Hit-man movie --if there is a next time-- they remember to have fun.",Hitman - Agent 47

Rupert Friend is convincing in playing Agent 47 but the role is not challenging and could be played by most actors in Hollywood today. He didn't take the opportunity to really own the role. Zachary Quinto was disappointing in this film, people expect better from him but instead get the standard assassin like character you see in all movies of this genre.

But this is very much annoying that they completely misjudged the concept of Hit-man. He is a silent assassin. Whatever his mission is, he always tried to avoid killing unnecessary peoples and also tried to save his bullets and money. But in the movie their is some unwanted violence, he kills whoever he wants. Also, in the game he tried to enter any area without seeing. But here, he was like dying to show his face. It was just like a normal action movie. Moreover, the story line is also very poor. ""Rupert"" was unable to walk like ""Timothy"" from the first movie.

What bothers me, however, is the story.For one, it's filled with cliché's (including a German evil man who wants to take over the world). Secondly, it doesn't even go with the story set by the video games. Why is Diana some Asian chick with an accent? In the games, she's clearly got a British accent and she's not Asian. Why does 47 go loud in almost every situation? Why is the same guy who was killed in the beginning of Hit-man: Contracts being killed again in this movie? These questions ruin the entire movie for me. I don't understand. Is this some parallel universe story thing going on or what? I'm only giving this a six because the actors did an amazing job as well as the people involved in recording and and editing.

156,roomanamir,Hit-man: Agent 47 isn't able to hit one mark right,1,26 September 2015,"Ever wondered why movies based on video games that are best sellers actually fail to achieve same level of financial success?The answer is very simple; the audience that plays those games isn't coming to watch the movie. Like an imagination developed by a book-reading cannot be replaced by a visual art, likewise audience who are engaged in playing video games can never actually understand the soul of movie making. With a video game their own thoughts is the center of their attention. How can we ask such a mind frame to focus on watching someone else's point of view on the material they weren't looking forward to understand but rather play and make more score?Why I have raised the question above is that now I can explain why I loved the original The Hit-man (2007) movie that came out in 2007. I never played the video game and I am sure neither did the audience that came to theatres and made it a financial success. Lot of critics panned it due to its slow pace and not being so much like the video game. But that was the best part of 2007 movie. It used the character of the video game as a metaphor. Not replicate it exactly like to be him. They showed what makes him a silent killer. These games were about stealth and strategy and The 2007 Movie presented that in couple sequences like one in the restaurant and the ending church scene. Those scenes were classic example to present that strength of The Hit-man's intelligence and skills. This new 2015 movie boasts so much about brains and Agent 47's (Rupert Firend) skills, but shows none of it. In fact he so stupid that he risks taking out his targets by entering US Embassy and getting locked in an interrogation room, giving out his name, his face and then escaping in thin air as UNKNOWN SILENT KILLER, huh!Why they needed to re-write the story of The Hit-man (2007) and make a reboot within 10 years of first one. I think for some stupid commercial reason. There has to be something better they think can be done from the previous one. This one is a waste of money on all accounts, story, action sequences, visual effects and actors. The surprises are so ridiculous that you ask yourself, why we need Agent 47 now? we might as well entertain ourselves with the better version of his as shown in the movie. By the way I am not talking here about the John Smith (played by Zachary Quinto) villain character but The Girl (Hannah Ware) who seems to be scared for the whole of the movie then suddenly turns into super skilled killing machine. This movie would have been much better as stand-alone not focusing, yet again, to supersede its predecessor. This new one was trying to get to the point of showing flashy gun play sequences. Which neither connects to video game style of action nor matches two seconds of fun we have experienced earlier this year with John Wick (2015). That Keanu Reeves movie was a pleasure from beginning till the end, and I think in its own way The Hit-man (2007) was an amazing movie in the genre. It was a perfect story of a silent killer whose name is not known, who sees things around him that he feel like getting attached to, but something in his genes stop him from doing so. Hit-man: Agent 47 (2015) is a serious waste of time. We would rather like more Lucy (2014), Taken (2008), District B-13 (2004) type of stuff. All of them ridiculous, but entertaining within its own boundaries.",Hitman - Agent 47
157,mikebellamyk,Watchable although predictable,5,23 October 2015,I was hoping that this sequel would have been so much better than the first hit-man. Unfortunately not. The only redemption was the cast as the three lead characters are watchable although they should have maybe put their names down for another production in all honesty. I don't think the intelligence of the movie going public was thought about as I could see the plot twists coming a mile off such as agent 47 being part of the fire crew. With the ridiculous 35 million dollars budget you would think that it would be possible to give the viewers a bit more to chew on than some fancy moves and gun splattered henchmen. If it wasn't for the cast and some of the action scenes I probably would have turned off well before the first generic action film one liner! Overall the film scored a low 5/10 and i don't think i will be watching it again any time soon!,Hitman - Agent 47

Spiderman, Superman, Batman, Fantastic Four all have gone through the motions, and Hit-man, after a first promising outing in the shape of Timothy Olyphant suffered the same fate. So here we are again, Rupert Friend has shaved his head and the body count may begin. Hannah Ware offers a very acceptable female lead. The story is almost secondary to the action, suffice to say that it is quite easily forgettable. The action and gunfights are very well done, bad marks though to the writers who at first seem to make Hit-man a bad guy. 6,8/10 "" - rogdieFor more reviews, please check Roger's Watchlist on IMDb , more than 1060 movies reviewed",Hitman - Agent 47

I did and I loved it.,9,23 August 2015,"I'm not a video game fan and although I saw the first movie (loved it) I don't allow myself to be jaded or to drudge up preconceived notions about what a movie should or shouldn't be based on something else. Whether it's concept was based on a book, video game or another movie I try to watch it based on its own merits.I just saw this movie today and thoroughly enjoyed it. I checked the reviews and was stunned at so many negative reviews that I had to come online and give my own two cents. I for one prefer not to have things explained to me at the beginning of a movie. The plot and subplots worked well and things were revealed as the movie played out. Sure there was a plot twist at the end, but with action movies that's to be expected. I for one would like to see a second installment and the door is open for that, but if it's the last movie, I don't feel cheated. The writing was well done for this genre, could it have been better, yes, but basically it was about the special effects, combat and car chase scenes which were quite stunning. I won't give too much away, but this is a distinctive movie, not repetitive or replicative of the first movie or the video games. It stands on its own. It's fun to watch, filled with action, and a decent plot. It made for an entertaining afternoon. Do not listen to the critics, judge it for yourself, you might just like it.Bottom line is, go see this movie with fresh eyes.

If you like it, I won't hold it against you. Personally, I thought it was insultingly stupid at times, at least when it wasn't completely screwing the original character over. When they started harpooning cars, I just threw my hands up and said: ""I give up!"" Please, no more of this. It. Was. Awful.Mr. Friend, Mr. Kretschmann or Mr. Hinds aren't to blame. They delivered their parts with their usual professionalism. Mr. Quinto was okay too.If you want to see a decent movie about Agent 47, watch ""Hitman"", starring Timothy Olyphant.

It is quite bloody and graphic with a lot of killing, so if that sort of thing bothers, then you might want to think twice.The plot and character development are average, but at least this film does have a plot and does attempt character development which is more than I can say for most films these days so . . .Overall, decent.",Hitman - Agent 47

But what came next was even worse, the dialog in the movie was so horribly wooden that I just can't believe this script was green lighted.The movie was filled with nods to the video games, obviously trying to win over the gaming crowd (which I'm one of), however the movie is just plain bad.I actually enjoyed the first Hit-man movie to some extent, but dear god, stay away from this flaming pile of dung.",Hitman - Agent 47

The movie portrays him completely different .... A ""Mass Murderer"" so as to speak ... which is the exact opposite of a ""Silent Assassin""! The guy looks and behaves nothing like the original game character.....(Nowhere close). Acts like an angry infant who is mightier than every other being around him.I don't get it! Why is Hollywood so keen on making reboots of games into movies! ... Especially Epic games and animes like Dragonballz and many others....

I have played Absolution, a tiny bit of blood money and the new Hit-man.

173,macdog17,Miss,2,2 September 2015,"A sequel to an adaptation of a video game. To lovers of decent film everywhere this sentence is a linguistic klaxon that screams ""Run fast, run far, do not turn back"". Think about it for a second. Think about films like ""Max Payne"", ""Prince of Persia"", ""Tomb Raider"" and, of course, the supremely execrable ""Mortal Kombat"". This is where big studio conservatism and the attendant franchise mania has gotten us - they'll make anything if they think there's a built-in audience.What's probably most surprising here is the cast. Have a look at the names. This isn't a bunch of desperate, talentless, straight-to-DVD chancers. They've all proved themselves to be more than capable in the past. And yet for some reason they've all ended up here together; each and every one begrimed by the woefulness of this ""movie"".The plot, and I'm using that word in its loosest possible sense, deals with a genetically engineered assassin who is attempting to track down Katia, the daughter of the man who genetically engineered him. There's a bit of a problem though because an organization called Syndicate International (they're an international syndicate you see) are after her too and they've sent John Smith, a man with sub-dermal titanium armour (no, I'm serious), out to make sure they get to her first.So, there you have it. What follows is basically lots of gunplay and car chases and explosions and fighting, the usual ingredients of your standard action movie. The only problem is that the director doesn't seem to understand how to direct his material. You can forgive the action genre most foibles as long as the big set pieces are decent but the problem here is that every single scene is directed like an action scene.Being close to tranquilised by boredom I found myself counting the amount of cuts in certain shots to stay lucid. There are 20 cuts to show Katia walking into a metro station. There are nearly 15 to show Agent 47 looking at his computer. When every non-action scene is cut and shot like an action scene there is no discernible change in momentum when the real action arrives thus robbing it of energy.A boring action movie is akin to a bland curry or an esoteric pantomime and when every fight scene is rendered incomprehensible thanks to yet another plethora of quick cuts and epileptic camera-work you quickly lose any sympathy you might have had in the first place. The fact that its barely over an hour and a half long should it make it more tolerable but somehow all that quick-cutting and frantic editing produce a time dilation effect so that a third of the way through you're already praying for the end.",Hitman - Agent 47

So I didn't have any expectations regarding this movie.While watching the movie it struck me that the movie showed a lot of resemblance with scenes used in The Matrix and things I've seen before in the Bourne franchise.
With regard to the Matrix some examples : the fight on the railway track could easily be compared to the subway fight between Neo and Mr. Smith, John Smith could be compared to Mr. Smith (Matrix), during one fight scene John Smith punches a hole in the wall just like Mr Smith did while fighting Morpheus, the US Embassy scene can easily be compared with the hotel lobby scene from Matrix, the front shot Agent 47 and Katia enter the elevator was an exact copy of the shot with the Neo and Trinity entering the elevator and so on, and so on.

Instead of an in-depth film about how he was made to be Agent 47 and getting in touch with how the personality was created, we get an invisible Terminator destructing and killing everything in his way from the jump.

The film dies out in the end- but is saved by good action sequences that relate well to the video game. For someone who has not played the game, I still enjoyed the movie and am compelled to start playing the game- although it is a departure from the typical video game that does not promote such violence or gore.

The choice of scenery is impressive and so are the action scenes. The Singapore scenes are truly unique as it have not been seen before by many living in the USA or Europe. Car chases are incredible. Hannah Ware and Rupert Friend seems to be a good pair. But I can't say the same about Zach Quinto. Overall, it does reminds me of Blade Runner with a more gripping tension.

196,charlie_the_cat_pooka,Much much better than I expected,10,25 August 2015,"I'll be honest, I didn't go into this movie expecting much. I'm not a big fan of the Hit-man franchise because I've always been a story-orientated player and the idea of playing a seemingly static character like 47 never appealed to me. Since seeing this movie, I've done some research and found out my initial opinion of the franchise was wrong and I should probably give the games a chance.Rupert Friend does an excellent job as Agent 47, capturing a man who is stoic and seemingly emotionless but also a liar. One of the cool elements of the movie is you can never tell if 47 is genuinely opening up to Katia (Hannah Price) about his feelings or whether he's just trying to manipulate her. Given he's contrasted, directly, against John Smith (Zachary Quinto) who does the exact same thing, it leaves the viewer with an interesting conundrum as to whether anything they're seeing from them is true. This is a cunning and cerebral 47 who knows exactly what he needs to do in order to get his target.The action scenes are, of course, the only reason anyone should go see this movie and they don't disappoint. They're silly, awesome, fun, and bloody. Agent 47 can do the John Woo guns akimbo thing with the best of them but he's also capable of taking down people with piano wire or shoving them into plane engines. None of them make a damn bit of sense in the real world but, honestly, who cares? This isn't the real world. This is the world where the Syndicate and ICA are dueling over a cloning project's future despite having cyborg super-soldiers at their beck and call.I'm not a believer that big, dumb action movies are automatically forgiven for being dumb. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a big, intelligent action movie for instance. However, I do think Hit-man is a big, silly action movie, which is something else entirely. It also benefits from a re-watch, yes I saw it twice, because 47's motivations are consistent throughout the movie but hidden from the viewer. I would very much be willing to watch another installment of this franchise with the same cast and hope it does well at the box office.",Hitman - Agent 47
197,nairby-1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!",1,22 August 2015,"I have been a fan of the Hit-man games for a long time, and this movie is absolutely awful.The actor who played Agent 47 is terrible. The story is awful. The character of Agent 47 was the complete opposite of the character in the games.In the games, Agent 47 is methodical, stealthy and calculated. In this movie, the character throws all of that out the window and turns the movie into a typical shoot 'em up. So much terribleness. The first Hit-man movie is much better.This movie is so bad that all comments on the Facebook page are positive, only because all negative comments get quickly deleted. Some people have even had the audacity to say that this movie stays true to the games. Other than the title and Agent 47's suit, nothing. Terrible! Save your money.",Hitman - Agent 47
198,wybe-2,Ridiculous,1,12 November 2015,"I'm very much a fan of the Hit-man games and was (again) shocked by the sheer ignorance in this film. Obvious mistakes and plot holes were apparent from the first minute; things like reloading guns only when it looks cool, guards with their backs to the elevator, contradictions in speech. Lack of a credibility of the entire storyline can be forgiven, since it's still a dystopian video game and don't we all love a dame in distress. The disrespect director Bach shows in ignoring the very nature of the games (stealth) and treating the audience as idiots is culpable. Most of the shots seem to have been made just to look good. CGI was not too good but unlike the rest of the film, functional.",Hitman - Agent 47
199,alex-christian,Makes the 2007 Hit-man film look like a masterpiece!,5,21 October 2015,"I never expected anything more of this film than run of the mill action with the Hit-man flavor. I was sorely disappointed. Firstly I felt like the first hour or so of the film was a take on ""The Terminator"" with a bit of a ""Leon: The Professional"" vibe too. There was even an antagonist who had rejuvenating body armour like a Terminator cyborg. He got shot plenty of times to kill him and even electrocuted but wouldn't die. Agent 47 was basically reduced to a supporting character and the ""sixth sense"" nonsense where the female protagonist learns to harness her own Hit-man skills is laughable. Throw in the old ""you're brother and sister"" and you've got your classic 1am made-for-TV b-movie. However my greatest disappointment was at the end when they take the HQ down and do all of this ""in-sync"" shooting with one another, crossing arms etc... it was so cringe worthy. The only cool part of the film for me was when I accepted she had a sixth sense of a sort and at the very end where the female protagonist anticipated a powerful army or special ops team of sorts coming up the stairs to get them, when in fact it was Agent 48. Then the film ended. It was kind of cool. I love Hit-man but was very disappointed although I do feel if they ever make another one they need to have an actor who is essentially a no-name because 47 is so blank in the face if you had a famous person playing the character I feel you would lose your suspension of disbelief. No disrespect to The Late Paul Walker who was in talks to play the iconic video game character. Lastly I feel that what the Hit-man games are about; stealth and creative ways to execute contracts is not what an action films wants which is full on shoot-outs. In the game Hit-man if you carried on the way they did in this film (or the last to be honest) then you would lose so many points for not being a ""silent assassin"" as he ""goes loud"" almost every time in this. The need to go Nolan-Batman, dark themed if they were to translate this into a successful film franchise.",Hitman - Agent 47

202,stosicpavle,The lead actor...,6,23 August 2015,"One thing that bugs me more than any other about this film is the choice of the lead actor. He looks more like poor man's Orlando Bloom, and less like Agent 47 from the video game. IMHO he doesn't look convincing enough to play this role. He looks too skinny to be an engineered human being, bred for one purpose, to be a killing machine (just shaving some actors head doesn't make him an Agent 47). Wouldn't all those years of physical training be visible on his physique? Maybe I'm wrong, and he was bred for stamina rather than strength. The action scenes are very well done with some genuine WOW moments, but the story feels too generic, and plagued with the same problems like the first attempt on turning this video game into a movie (they just had to have a woman as his sidekick again!!!). If you expect a good action flick, you will be satisfied, but if you are a video game fan, this just won't do it for you, as it didn't do it for me.",Hitman - Agent 47

DISCRETION!It's all about how he blends in, how he hides in the shadows. If you have to physically engage guards or any other people except your target you feel like you did something wrong.This movie was just an action movie that tries to get some of the video-game franchise fans to pay for the ticket.

The story lines is quite simple and no much amusements. The film is packed with action-fights which sometimes feel like over the limit. The image of a hit-man has been destroyed here and it is more like an universal solider, or a film Rambo. ""Katia"", the actress is not up to a good justification of the character, I suppose. Fights are like dances which are very unrealistic. As a whole a movie like this style should have been done better. This movie is more like a first person shooting video game rather than backing it up with a good story behind. That is why I rate this as a near average movie. There is no good point that can back up the rating.",Hitman - Agent 47
205,windeck-c,A action movie with lots of gun action that has nothing to do with the game series,5,22 August 2015,"Those who know the game series will miss the real Hit-man in this movie. Hit-man in the games is someone who assassinates, make kills look like accidents and who searches secret paths to get himself a benefit.The movie however is just another action movie with a not so interesting story. The movie features lots of gun action, but nothing special we have not seen in other movies before.There are a few fun scenes when shot enemies fall from catwalks but the most spectacular parts are already given away by the trailer.The story is put into the background a lot and the actual enemy of Hit-man and Katia seems to be playing a guest role and is not a just worthy antagonist.All in all this is a nice action movie that lacks story and tension.",Hitman - Agent 47
206,seacocean,Loved this action movie,10,6 February 2016,"Agent 47 is one bad dude! Even though I had not seen most of the actors before, I thoroughly enjoyed the fast moving action, special effects and graphics. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. The story line was suspenseful and the acting was better than most in this genre. The stunts in this film were among the best I've ever seen. The filming and clarity of the audio was also excellent. I sure hope there will be some sequels, I want more. And I really think that Zachary Quinto may have found a new calling, I totally hope to see more action films in his future. In fact, maybe a James Bond role? All in all, IMHO, this is a must see if you are a die hard action film buff.I can only imagine that some of the bad reviews are due to the movie not resembling a video game or the series, which I have seen neither.

209,maltesefalcon-91100,Not ''shit'' but very disappointing,5,7 September 2015,"Before I start I am a huge fan of the Hit-man games, so naturally I was disappointed by the movie. Their is no character development, the acting is mediocre at best and the action scenes use too many jump cuts. I felt that they didn't spend enough time on Agent 47 himself (Rupert Friend)and that it was mainly about the other lead girl (Hannah Ware)perhaps it should have been called Hitwomen Agent 90. I also felt that the movie was too short and that it completely strayed away from the game.It was just loud shootouts all the time. I mean Agent 47 is known for using the twin silverballers with silencers and I tell you he doesn't use the silencers once, at least in the previous hit-man film he uses them. However I did find that Rupert Friend was much better in the role than Timothy Olyphant was in 2007 you can see he was committed to the role and the cinematography was also quite good at times. If you want to watch a very dull action flick with no heart then this film is for you but as a film fanatic and a video gamer it certainly did not live up to the standards set by the game! 5/10",Hitman - Agent 47
210,sarlyrical,Gotta Love 'Critics' these days?,8,21 August 2015,"I was honestly not expecting much from this movie, But after watching some of the trailers and looking at the photos a couple weeks out from the release. I was getting pretty keen to see it!One thing I can say is ignore the critics and actually go see it and form your own opinion, much like the first movie starring Timothy Olyphant this movie was Awesome and replicated the tone, brutality and intensity of the games. I also have no idea what people are expecting from a movie/ movies based on video games. And in this case Hit-man. The first movie came out in 2007, so no one can say this movie was rushed considering Zachary Quinto was announced/ attached to Pre-production ages ago haha. I'm not here to argue or bitch, but is anyone actually expecting a video game movie to win an Oscar? If so why? Video games are enjoyable But don't envy the director who has to take multiple elements from a game and translate that onto screen. However in this case, the New Hit-man is Incredible in it's own right. But feel free to trend in sharing someone else's opinion and not having your own :) Good life Good luck! I honesty give it an 8/10 because yes, abit more time spent on it would have been a benefit. But who actually goes to see a movie based on a video game expecting an Oscar winning movie? lol The writing - I thought was Awesome I thought everything was exactly how a Hit-man Game would be written. The acting - If neither Rupert Friend or Zachary Quinto win an Oscar I would be surprised. Notice I said actor winning an Oscar not the movie? Because the movie was Great! but it isn't perfect. Rupert Friend owned the role as 47 and Zachary Quinto killed it in his role. Is it the best video game movie? - I wouldn't go that far and I don't think anyone else would either. But it's up there in my opinion. It's in no way shape or form the worst video game movie. And it's already been released that Rupert has signed a multiple picture deal, so a sequel is at least coming. And I think it at least earned that! Conclusion - So do what you want, trend and follow an opinion and never form your own. Or go see it for yourself.",Hitman - Agent 47

The plot is about an agent program that has these killing lethal killing machines but then the government demanded the creators to destroy it and to destroy every robot. But one of them survives and that is agent 47. Agent 47 is finding the creator's daughter and it's up to them to put a stop to the agent program once and for all.

Worst and worst every year. Now new ideas. From great Hit-man game story they created few Audi Commercialsin one movie and few theater look fight scenes. What kind of camera did they use ? I don't know but probably some cheap one. Many scene in this movie looks like theater or TV series, not like cinema movies. Completely no storyline, poor soundtrack (only trailer song was great) They said this movie is based on IO Interactive game but it's not. Not even close. In the game there is a great storyline, great mood. In the movie there is nothing like that. Screenplay for the movie should be created by IO Interactive Team instead Hollywood studio. This would be much better. IO Interactive knows how to create good story. Hollywood people - not.

In the games, he has a big physical presence and stealthy approach to his kills. In the film, we got a skinny dude in a Topman suit who is about as stealthy as a pregnant nun. The actor looks more like a 'Paul from accounting' than an assassin. I can't decide whether he was unconvincing as Agent 47 because of his look, or because of poor acting — I suspect both.The action scenes/fights feel boring and generic. The whole point of the Hit-man games was to use your brain to kill without alerting everyone in the building. An all out shoot-it-out is entertaining on occasion, but not when every fight scene involves 0 stealth. I could have looked past this inconsistency if the fight scenes had been vaguely interesting or well done, but alas 95% of them were 'agent 47 spots enemy, shoots in head with pistol, then moves on'.And just when the film was about to bore me to sleep, they'd slip in a raunchy scene with our damsel in distress which just about kept me from leaving.Don't waste your money on this film, it feels low budget and has poor acting/action scenes from the get go.",Hitman - Agent 47

It annoys me that the directors and script writers cant just stick to the format of the games, surely thats why they're good... listen stop sticking game titles on films just to sell them to fans, this would've been a heck of a better action film if it wasn't ""based on the game"" and was called something different, i don't mean to gripe so much but it really frustrates me, it is a better of the 2 films though, good acting from Rupert Friend, good acting from Hannah Ware, was her role needed? In my opinion no, it would've been good enough, it surely has done no harm but you know, good scenery good overall story and a bit of a bullish ending but turn your brain off forget its a, ahem, ""Hitman"" and enjoyment will be had, at least it appears we have a second one to improve upon...",Hitman - Agent 47

The only aim is to search the man who first started this program through his daughter. How much more fascinating can a 'simple' action movie get?

Hit-man: Agent 47 does not even remotely grasp the essence of the actual hit-man. The actual hit-man is not a super human gun slinger but is a SILENT ASSASSIN who resorts to assassinating his targets in a very discrete way. And therefore this movie has miserably failed to do justice to the Hit-man. Rupert Fiend is a good actor but imagine how it would have been if the producers had tried David Bateson with his characteristic Agent 47 voice over. This movie seemed more like an advertisement of Audi or a bollywood flick where the protagonist can just about achieve anything. Agent 47's signature Fibre wire and silver-ballers have been used in vain. If only, the makers of had adopted the plot of Hit-man absolution they would have fared much better. Also the music/score accentuate the shortcomings of this title. A better option would be to hire the absolution sound team or better yet Jesper Kyd, who worked on the initial titles of the games.

Now, that's all well and good if you're into that sort of thing, but anyone going into these movies as fans of the games, prepare to be extremely disappointed. The entire point of the series of games was to remain unseen, only engage people when necessary, get in, eliminate the target, and get out again with minimal fuss. This (and the first) movie are the exact opposite. Obviously a ploy by the makers to cash in on the name and make a cheap buck off of fans of the games. Don't even get me started on the awful casting and the fact they couldn't even make 47 look completely bald, rather than just the shaved head look...It's another 'Resident Evil' situation, for me. Instead of the taut, tense horror/thriller, we got CGI, over the top nonsense with zombies thrown in.
