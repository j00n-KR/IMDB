0,SnoopyStyle,failed rebound,4,10 December 2020,"Al Capone (Tom Hardy) is released after a decade in prison due to his poor health from late stage syphilis. He is hounded by hallucinations and lives with his family in Florida. He believes that he had hidden $10 million but can't remember where.This is an idea more than a movie. There really isn't much of a point other than a fleeting treasure hunt and Tom Hardy doing his Oscar reel. It would be interesting to do a movie about his wife. If it wants to be the treasure hunt, it should start with the government agents and their reason for releasing the man. There is a son. There is the family. It's a lot things and nothing well examined. This is not a good rebound film for Josh Trank. The filmmaking looks good but the story goes down too many dead ends. It introduces characters but don't expand on them. It hints at a deeper story but ends up with a muddle.",Capone
1,nogodnomasters,Fonse,4,6 June 2020,"This is a sad story about the last year of a man dying from syphilis. Capone is losing it at both ends while his family tries to cope and care for him. Meanwhile, there is a discussion of $10 million dollars he had hidden and doesn't recall where the money is at, not liking to keep notes, trusting no one.The acting was decent, but such a film should only be a by-line at the end of a real film about Capone. It would be like watching ""The Iron Lady"" without an flashbacks. Just can't wait for those good old days when I can hide my own Easter Eggs.Guide: F-word (2 languages) sex. No nudity.",Capone
2,kosmasp,The other Capone,8,30 May 2021,"This has quite the talented group of actors assembled. Which makes me wonder how the score is so low. But on the other hand I am not so surprised - because while this is about the infamous Capone, it is not the Capone we have seen in the past. It is rather a Capone that has lost his touch ... with reality, with his peers and loved ones and so much more.And that makes this a movie that is not easy to watch at all. Tom Hardy though gives a superb performance! Sublime and and subtle, he touches all the right bases! Make-up effects are great and cinematography also works in the movies favor. The movie is quite violent and insane ... in many regards. Just be aware of that.",Capone
3,classicsoncall,"""I'm grateful for Grandpa Fonse"".",6,10 September 2020,"Don't be misled by the title, the picture isn't about the glory days of America's most famous gangster. Instead, it takes a look at the final year of Al Capone's life in what is most likely conjecture, since much of the story involves his visions and imaginary conversations with people from his present and past, including a young, pre-teen version of himself. That's the thing, once it's over, you have no idea what might have been real or what Capone might have dreamt up in his dementia addled state of mind. A perfect example being the gold plated machine gun sequence in which he mows down a handful of his associates fearing they're the enemy. The first to go down is bodyguard Gino (Gino Cafarelli), but immediately after, we see Gino at Capone's side along with members of his family trying to console the deranged criminal. As a backdrop, we see the crime kingpin's possessions being hauled off for failure to keep up payments, while the Feds unsuccessfully attempt to interrogate Capone over an alleged ten million dollar stash that he can't remember hiding. With what he has to work with, Tom Hardy does an exemplary job of depicting a Capone who's lost all his marbles, but it's often a slog to get through with the long, brooding shots of the gangster facing the camera, never knowing if there's a coherent thought behind the facade. The sight of Hardy's Capone whaling away in a diaper is one of the more depressing sequences in the picture, and even more disgusting is the one scene in which he gives new meaning to the colloquial expression, he ---- the bed. And you thought the horse's head in ""The Godfather"" was scary!",Capone
4,lee_eisenberg,misdeeds come back to haunt you,6,9 August 2020,"Al Capone remains one of the most famous and iconic gangsters of all time. During the 1920s he practically owned Chicago (owing in part to prohibition). After spending several years in jail, he got released to his residence in Florida to live out the rest of his life. Suffering from neurosyphilis, Capone could only sit around reminiscing on his life of crime.Josh Trank's ""Capone"" looks at this. Tom Hardy plays the moribund criminal. It's one intense performance. The rest of the characters didn't really stick in my mind. It's an OK movie, not great.PS: Al Capone once said ""Never trust a cop. You never know when he might go straight.""",Capone
5,jboothmillard,Capone,4,4 March 2021,"I found out about this film when it was suggested as a contender for the upcoming Razzies, which I became an official voter for. All I knew about the real gangster is what was portrayed in the original 1930s version of Scarface (the nickname which he loathed) and The Untouchables with Robert De Niro, so I was most interested to see this film, written and directed by Josh Trank (Chronicle, Fantastic Four). Basically, it has been a few years since mobster Al Capone (Tom Hardy) was released from prison, found guilty of tax evasion. After being incarcerated for over a decade, the once most feared bootlegger in Chicago, at the age of 40, is deemed by the government as no longer a threat. Capone returns home and retires to his mansion in Palm Island, Florida with his family. Sometime later, aged 47, his mind starts slowly rotting away from untreated neurosyphilis. He remains under surveillance by FBI agents, who think he may be faking his insanity. Capone is forced to sell many of his remaining belongings to pay old debts and support himself. Over time, Capone begins hallucinating, haunted by his crimes and violent past. As the disease progresses, he loses control of his motor functions. He recalls hiding $10 million before he was convicted, but he cannot remember where it is. His wife Mae (Scooby-Doo's Linda Cardellini) finds it difficult to stand by him, because of his constant rudeness and outburst, but she cannot leave him. Capone is often visited over time by older brother Ralph (Al Sapienza) and his friend Johnny (Matt Dillon). Capone's memory is nearly gone, and following a physical confrontation with Mae, she instructs her husband's bodyguards to keep everyone away from him. Meanwhile, Capone has increasingly debilitating visions of the men he killed and many of the violent acts he committed. His mental capacity continues to deteriorate, until psychiatrist Doctor Karlock (Kyle MacLachlan) is hired to evaluate him, who determines his IQ is no more than that of a child. The doctor says also that Capone must stop smoking cigars, so he is given carrots to put in his mouth. One day, Capone has a really big outburst when he takes his gold-coloured tommy gun from his desk and goes on a shooting rampage, firing all over the place, hitting the house walls and injuring staff members, until he is calmed down. The FBI realise that he truly has lost the plot and leave. In the end, wracked with guilt and having alienated all around him, Capone died from his syphilis in January 1947 at the age of 48. His surviving family changed their name from Capone, and the millions of dollars hidden was never recovered. Also starring Kathrine Narducci as Rosie, Noel Fisher as Junior, Jack Lowden as Crawford, and Josh Trank as Agent Harris. Hardy gives a fascinating performance as the once powerful crime lord suffering dementia, everything from his raspy voice (which I guess can compared to Harvey Fierstein) to him singing as the Cowardly Lion whilst watching The Wizard of Oz is very watchable. While it is an interesting story about the final year in the life of a notorious figure who is losing his mind, literally, it is let down by a messy script and perhaps questionable moments, but overall, it is a reasonable biographical drama. Okay!",Capone
6,michaelRokeefe,Out of curiosity...addled Al Capone,5,20 November 2020,"Much in his prime the King of Chicago during Prohibition has served 10 years in prison for tax evasion. At the age of 47, he is deemed not a danger to anyone and lives out his life suffering from dementia in his heavily guarded home in Florida. The infamous gangster comes to be haunted by his violent past. Tom Brady can be nothing but emotionless playing and old man reliving his life through flashbacks. Due to Capone being the subject; this is watched out of curiosity.",Capone
7,searchanddestroy-1,Interesting,8,30 November 2020,"When I learned that Tom Hardy was making a movie starring Al Capone's last days, I first thought it would be about his years in jail, at least. But no, it is about his very last years, in Miami, and that's a part that has never been filmed; except for a short sequence in Steve Carver's CAPONE, starring Ben Gazzara. I understand that many viewers were deceived by this one, but not me, because Tom Hardy gives a terrific performance. And that's definitely NOT a crime or gangster movie, as you usually deal with, speaking of such a history of crime figure, among the most notorious of all times. I would say it's a poignant film, about forfeiture.",Capone
8,LeonLouisRicci,UGLY...SLOPPY...USELESS...PAINFUL TO WATCH...LITERALLY STINKS UP THE SCREEN,1,25 August 2021,"That Smell You Thought You Smelled While Watching this Despicable Display was Coming from the Orifice of Tom Hardy Overacting Once Again.Perhaps the Most Overrated Actor Working Today.One Could Say He Hasn't Given a Respectable Performance Since ""Bronson"" (2008).Choosing Heavily Made Up Characters at Every Turn and Turning Them into a Mumble-Fest of Indecipherable Dialog and Acting-Tics Associated with Thespians Out of Their Depth.Here all of Hardy's Sleight-of-Hand Hoodwinking Audiences and Critics with Misdirection that Gives the Appearance of Acting Supremacy but it's All a Con.He has Turned a Character Acting Style of Method so Over-the-Top it could be Fascinating to Watch if it wasn't so Overrated and Fawned After.This Movie is a Showcase for All of That Pretentiousness.Besides the Hardy Debacle and Display the rest of the Movie can't do Anything to Counter-Act the Lead Actor/Character with Anything Interesting.Resorting to Show Hallucinations that are Uninspired and Dull.With Events like Capone's Estranged and Illegitimate Son used to Evoke Sympathy and Soften the Often Hard-to-Take Bodily Fluids Flowing All Over the Screen.Not Recommended to Anyone Except Masochists.",Capone
9,zardoz-13,"""Capone"" is Kaput!!!",3,11 June 2020,"Prohibition Era bootlegger Alphonse Gabriel Capone has been the subject of several memorable Hollywood movies. Initially, character actor Rod Steiger played the notorious Chicago mobster in director Richard Wilson's black & white classic ""Al Capone"" (1959). Later, Broadway actor Jason Robards appeared as Capone in director Roger Corman's ""The St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" (1967) and this movie depicted the notorious bloodbath in a Chicago garage that Capone orchestrated so he could topple rival gang headed up by Bugs Moran in 1929. Ben Gazzara donned the gangster's distinctive fedora for director Steve Carver's ""Capone"" (1975), and Sylvester Stallone co-starring as Capone's right-hand gunsel Frank Nitti. Robert De Niro, who parlayed a career out of portraying both factual and fictional gangsters, played the Italian crime boss in director Brian De Palma's Oscar-winning epic ""The Untouchables"" (1987) opposite Kevin Costner's Elliot Ness. If you saw ""The Untouchables,"" it is hard to forget the scene where Capone wields a baseball bat to deal with one of his treacherous minions. Mind you, actors Steiger, Robards, Gazzara, and De Niro shared one thing in common, they impersonated the FBI's Public Enemy #1 during his seven-year reign as the murderous chieftain who oversaw gambling concessions, brothels, loansharking operations, protection services, and homicidal escapades. These four movies rank as worth-watching if you fancy yourself an aficionado of American crime sagas.Now, English actor Tom Hardy joins them in ""Fantastic Four"" director Josh Trank's ""Capone,"" but this glossy but gloomy movie provides only a glimpse of the mobster's underworld exploits. Basically, ""Capone"" covers the final days of the Chicago bigwig's career after the U.S. Government released him from the confines of the escape-proof Alcatraz Prison in the heart of San Francisco Bay. While all other Capone biographies have focused on his rise and fall, Trank's ""Capone"" covers the final days of the gangster's life. If you enjoy glamorous, bullet-riddled mobster melodramas, you may want to think twice before you sit down to see this version of his life. When we meet Capone here, the hoodlum is no longer the flamboyant mob boss who made national headlines. Capone's seriously declining health constituted the main reason that the Government allowed him to leave the Federal Penitentiary with only ten years served on his eleven-year sentence. Hardy's Capone is racked by troubling 'crime doesn't pay' memories, few of which are gratifying either for him or us. Indeed, gifted writer & director Josh Trank presents the thoroughly unsavory side of ex-con's life. By this time, Capone had been afflicted by a festering case of neurosyphilis. Reportedly, Capone contracted syphilis during his early years as a bouncer in ""Big Jim"" Colosimo's houses of prostitution. Unfortunately, when Capone acquired this nasty social disease, medical science had not yet found a cure. Penicillin was not available until after World War II. The bacteria in Capone's untreated syphilis would spread to and devastate other organs, including eventually his brain. When the authorities released him for good behavior, Capone was too far gone to ever reclaim his prominence in the crime world.Virtually everything that occurs in ""Capone"" transpires during his last woebegone days at his sprawling Florida mansion where he died on January 25, 1947, at age 48, from heart failure. Tom Hardy delivers an inspired performance of the former mob boss nicknamed 'Scarface,' but he spends most of his time suffering in pain as he relives parts of his past. Worst of all, neither Trank nor Hardy pulls any punches in their gruesome depiction of Capone's final days. Twice in ""Capone,"" the gangster experiences the shame of fouling his underwear, once while he is dressed up for a formal occasion with his family and then later when his wife awakens in the middle of the night to the stench of his bowel movement in their king-sized bed. If there has ever been a crime movie that expunged every trace of glamor from a gangster's life, ""Capone"" never misses a chance to show how the man degenerated into mindless dementia and eventually died. Nothing about this polished production, with its sturdy cast, including Linda Cardellini as Capone's wife Mae and Matt Dillon as one of his former criminal accomplices, is memorable. Throughout ""Capone,"" the former gangland boss scours his addled brain for $10-million that he thought he had stashed somewhere. Sadly, Capone cannot recall where he hid those millions. Similarly, IRS officials have been eavesdropping on his telephone conversations in case his memory improves. At one point, Capone arms himself with a gold-plated Thompson .45 caliber machine gun and shoots up the premises. He is furious because Mae and his family have been forced to sell his collection of priceless statues on the grounds of his estate to pay for their bills.It is difficult to imagine what prompted Tom Hardy and director Josh Trank to make such an altogether depressing film that drags interminably for an hour and forty-three miserable minutes with little relief in sight. Originally, ""Capone"" was scheduled for a theatrical release, but the coronavirus pandemic ruled that out that possibility. Nevertheless, why anybody would willingly produce such a disgusting film, even for home video release defies analysis. Skip ""Capone!""",Capone
10,ferguson-6,dementia downer,6,12 May 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. I was really hoping for a Josh Trank resurgence. When his FANTASTIC FOUR became one of the worst reviewed movies of 2015, he lost out on a chance to direct a Star Wars film. Given creative control as writer-director-editor, CAPONE was supposed to be his chance bounce back and re-capture the intrigue and promise of his first film, CHRONICLE (2011). And he even chose the fascinating notorious gangster Al Capone as the subject for his comeback. What could go wrong? Well ... most everything.Tom Hardy usually adds enough interest to make any of his projects entertaining to watch, and sometimes he's downright brilliant. Going back to BRONSON (2008), and on through TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY (2011), WARRIOR (2011), THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (2012), MAD MAX: FURY ROAD (2015), THE REVENANT (2015), and TV's ""Peaky Blinders"", Mr. Hardy has quite a resume of memorable characters - and the above list barely covers half. This time out he plays Al Capone ... ""Fonse"" ... don't dare call him Al ""in this house."" He has recently been released from Alcatraz where he was serving his sentence for tax evasion. Confined to his Florida mansion, Capone is only 47 years old, but looks twenty years older thanks to the effects of neurosyphillis-induced dementia. His mind is never clear and his visions take him back to his violent criminal past, or snapshots of his youth (with an ever-present gold balloon).We can't really tell if filmmaker Trank meant this as a parody or not. Capone is seen as a mumbling near-zombie, almost always wearing a bathrobe. His eyes are bloodshot, and the once menacing gangster is now a paranoid, saggy diaper-wearing shell who noisily chomps on a cigar (or carrot), fires off his gold-plated Tommy Gun, and has constant issues with vomit-bladder-bowels. Typically a parody offers either slapstick or black comedy, but I only recall a single chuckle ... one that occurs when Capone pulls out a shotgun while on a fishing boat with his old mob buddy Johnny (Matt Dillon). Other than that, it's mostly a bleak look at dementia and the lost power of a man who follows his visions into closets and basements, and jumps up during a movie to sing-a-long with the Cowardly Lion's ""If I Were the King of the Forest.""The supporting players are given little to work with. The great Linda Cardellini plays Mae, Capone's supportive wife, while Kyle MacLachlan is his crooked doctor, Noel Fisher is Al junior, Al Sapienza is Capone's brother Ralphie, and Kathrine Narducci is Ralphie's wife. There is a secondary plot point involving government surveillance as they attempt to discover the whereabouts of the $10 million Capone supposedly stashed years ago. Of course, Capone doesn't remember, and when and FBI agent (Jack Lowden, with director Trank in a cameo) interrogates him, he's unsure whether Capone is acting or actually that far gone. There is also a bit about phone calls from ""Tony"", possibly a long-lost Capone son borne from an affair.The film covers Capone's final year, and mostly it comes across as a sad and depressing view of dementia. The most obvious statement on Capone's loss of power, comes in the form of a metaphor, as his beloved ""Lady Atlas"" garden statue is removed to be sold off. There is also a recurring moment where Capone tunes the radio to a broadcast of the Saint Valentines' Day Massacre, and family time at Thanksgiving is nothing short of painful to watch. Cinematographer Peter Deming (MULHOLLAND DRIVE, 2001) gives us a well shot film, but despite a couple of David Lynch-type moments, the film mostly lacks entertainment value. I can't figure out who might want to watch this. Trank seemed to go the deeply artistic route on a subject that's tough to watch. Maybe he'll get yet another shot.Available on VOD beginning May 12, 2020",Capone
11,bombersflyup,Bad.,1,13 May 2020,"Capone is such dreary nothingness, with hallucinations.Without a doubt the most empty, uninspiring film I've ever seen. Tom Hardy's not necessarily bad, there's just no script.",Capone
12,blanbrn,Raw and painful down like look as legendary figure reflects on a haunted past.,6,13 August 2020,"""Capone"" really can't be called a biography yet more of a final telling of the last days of one Al Capone as his life after serving time in prison for tax fraud is spent in sunny Florida. This picture is a flashback which looks at the pain and past wicked ways that helped shaped one Capone into a very violent figure. Showing from his early days as a ruthless businessman and bootlegger who ruled the streets of Chicago to the now present days of his fading life as he battles dementia. Along the way Al's family has remained while he's hid both his pride and money clearly it's a fortune! Tom Hardy is in fine form as his gravel deep voice set's Al apart from other gang figures. Overall not the best crime movie or bio type picture still it's a good reflection of an iron fist rulers final days.",Capone
13,ops-52535,a huge dissapointer,4,12 May 2020,"Al capone used to be an institution and a brandname for the free and selfentrepeneuring sole of the socalled underworld usa. and after viewing this , ill rather keep his memory from written books and other productions because this is just a bad reminiscence of a cruel but also a genious in the criminal trade. do not watch this for the historical update you might want, and as a film towards the topic of dementia. because its a grand misere.its a biographical epos upon al capones last year, a broken man economically and physical and mental breakdown due to neurosyphilis, a disease contracted in the haydays of his life. it is for sure not an autobiographical flick, nor is it not a historically correct one either. its has some pieces of true demential moments that can easily be observed if your working with this kind of patients. there are the typical cognitive losses, the hallucinative sessions, wher one hears and see things that is not the, the angry outbursts without no reason, the sudden flashbacks of memories etc. there are a lot of anxiousness and suspicion against all and everyone.what i feel though is that this story aint the real story, its just humbug written by a director that wish to make a milestone on a name in history that is just as notorious as evil roman emperors, or hitler or stalin. but its not even hitting the target at all. tom hardy tries and fullfilles the role pretty good, but the rest of the cast is a mess of outranged and desolate actors just filling in for a dime. what i will remember best from this saga is the big cigar chunked in his mouth that eventually is replaced by a carrot for helth reasons, and the grumpy growls mr hardy has specialized on through his film carriereso with a grumpy groan i will say weve been scamed and frauded of historical facts , and if you do want to view this, put your caleidoscopic binoculars close to the eyes and think for yourself. the grumpy old man will not recommend it unless your a tom hardy nerd, or like me fascinated by the mobsters of the liquerless pimping 1920&1930's U S of A",Capone
14,Thanos_Alfie,Disappointing...,5,20 May 2020,"""Capone"" is a Crime - Biography movie in which we watch Al Capone who after spending 10 years in prison returns to his house. There he starts suffering from dementia and more problems occur.I have to admit that I had high expectations from this movie and unfortunately I was disappointed by it. I expected this movie to include more scenes of Al Capone's past and to make a nice connection with his current condition. The interpretation of Tom Hardy who played as Fonse (Al Capone) was good but I believe he did not reach his potential and he was not enough to make this movie great. The direction which was made by Josh Trank who is also the writer of it, was simply average. If you expect to watch a movie about Al Capone's life in connection with his life after prison then don't watch this movie.",Capone
15,eddie_baggins,Not the Capone film many would be expecting,5,2 July 2020,"If we're being honest, its surprising that Josh Trank ever stepped behind the directors chair again after the much maligned and much-talked about Fantastic Four experience that has become somewhat of a Hollywood legend, with the upstart director's on set behavior and final product seemingly extinguishing a career that at one time seemed destined for great things.Five years on from the debacle of that high-profile affair, Trank has re-emerged with his low-budget and intimate Capone (previously known as Fonzo), a very different film to the one many would've thought we were getting as the director and his game leading man Tom Hardy choose to forgo a biopic of the famed gangster to instead focus on the last months of his life as his physical and mental health deteriorates upon his release from a long term prison sentence.Set almost exclusively in the confines of Capone's Florida mansion, as Capone struggles to maintain his sanity, his bowels and his memory of a fortune he buried somewhere before his incarceration, Capone is not even close to being anything like a gangster movie as we are taken on a wild and sometimes mind-meltingly odd journey into the deep recesses of a man haunted by his violent past.It's the last thing you'd expect from a previously spectacle orientated director and an all-in performer like Hardy, who delivers one of his more polarizing performances under the thick guise of makeup, as the cigar chomping crime boss remains front and centre throughout, often in nothing more than some PJ's.It's hard to know whether Hardy's performance is a masterclass of over acting and full-body inhabitation or an overblown miscalculation.It's undeniable that its the type of performance that is hard to turn away from, with some scenes like a golden tommy gun wielding rampage or a sing along to the Wizard of Oz images you won't soon forget but it would've been great to have seen Hardy be able to play the character in a less debilitated state to really gage what we are getting from the esteemed performer.Whatever the final verdict ends up being around Hardy's turn, his a reason that the film keeps ticking along as Trank's narrative structure doesn't help the film along in most instances with a plethora of dangling plot points and ideas barely explored, with the overall sense of feeling this is a half-baked account of the later years of Capone's life, with the film not particularly interested in going anywhere of significant note, even if its well-filmed happenings, memorable score by EL-P and oddly moving final moments showcase glimpses of the film at its best.Final Say -Not the be all and end all Capone film many would've been hoping for, Capone is a strange beast with an equally strange performance front and centre throughout, with those seeking a genuine gangster film with all the tropes associated with that better off giving Tranks comeback a very wide berth.2 1/2 platypus's out of 5",Capone

Scarface, nor that he is someone for whom it would be worth putting up with this disgusting display for an entire movie.The approach should have been obvious: show Capone in his last, pathetic days, and provide us flashbacks that bring us up to speed with the important events in his life that we may not be familiar with.The filmmaker is less interested in this approach than he is in unleashing his inner David Lynch.

18,kevin_robbins,There really isn't anything here to get audiences excited and that's disappointing for a Hardy film on Capone,2,29 August 2021,"Capone (2020) is a movie we watched on Prime shortly after its release during the pandemic. The storyline follows Capone at the tale end of his life when he's been released from prison due to barely being coherent but still able to spend time with his family. In his reduced state it wont stop family members and the media from trying to take advantage of his last days on Earth. Capone struggles with dealing with the day to day of just living let alone thwarting all the leaches that surround him. This movie is directed by Josh Trank (Fantastic Four) and stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Matt Dillon (Crash), Linda Cardellini (Brokeback Mountain), Kathrine Narducci (The Irishman) and Kyle MacLachlan (Dune). The storyline for this picture is bland for having such a larger than life character to focus on. Capone didn't do much in this and Hardy was reduced to a series of grunts and aimless facial expressions. The plot isn't overly interesting and the conclusion isn't fulfilling. There really isn't anything here to get audiences excited and that's disappointing for a Hardy film on Capone. I would recommend skipping this and would score it a 2/10.",Capone
19,alindsay-al,A Truly Terrible Film,1,3 March 2021,"This film made its way to foreign markets last year and was met with dreadful reviews, it has now come to the UK via Netflix so I had to watch it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the notorious gangster Al Capone in the last year of his life as he deals with dementia and the actions of his life.Main Character
Tom Hardy plays Capone here and it has to be said that he is a great actor but he is terrible here and this is one of the worst performances I have seen in a long time. He just walks around and grunts, he is so hard to understand and this guy was Bane so I have learnt to understand tough voices but this was too much. It is such a weird portrayal and I'm guessing it is not all of Hardy's fault and this is hopefully just a one off mistake from him.Supporting Characters
Linda Cardellini plays his wife and she does an alright job here, she is quite possibly the best part of the film though that isn't actually saying much. Kyle MacLachlan plays a doctor and he is also decent but he isn't in the film that much. But the rest of the cast offer very little and don't add anything to the overall experience of the film.Story
The story is so dull and boring, it literally sees Capone sitting around and mumbling for pretty much 2 hours and it did nothing for me. The film basically breezes over the interesting parts of Capone's life and focuses on this weird and boring aspect that is just confusing and mind numbingly boring.Script
The script is awful, half the time I couldn't understand what Hardy was saying and even when I did none of it was interesting and the whole film is just uninspired. There is no humour and the film is written so poorly that the plot is laid out terribly to make you really not care about anything.Style
The film has a really slow pacing and won't keep you interested for any reason. The structure of the film is terrible and never picks up, the backgrounds look okay but there is nothing to raise this awful film up and you will give up on it before it is done, unless you are foolish like me.Overall
Overall, this is a truly terrible film, maybe one of the worst I have ever seen. I had heard how bad it was but maybe it is worse, avoid it at all cost and don't waste the two hours that I did.",Capone

21,r96sk,'Capone' disappoints,6,28 February 2021,"'Capone' disappoints.It's not what I was expecting. I hadn't heard much about it admittedly, but I was anticipating a full blown film about Al Capone - especially with the casting of Tom Hardy. That's not a bad thing in isolation, at all, but coupled with iffy storytelling it ends up being a waste.Hardy (Al) is undoubtedly the best thing about this, yet I still think he had way more in him for this sort of role - if the filmmakers had allowed him to use it, of course. There aren't any standouts behind Hardy, though Linda Cardellini (Mae) and Kyle MacLachlan (Karlock) are OK.There's nothing I massively dislike about this, I just wanted so much more from it. It is, I will say, at least a film that makes you think - I just don't, personally, think it came out as perhaps intended.",Capone
22,aidanratesmovies,"Enjoyed it for what it was, not what I thought it may be",8,16 September 2020,"This is not, simply stated, a gangster film- or at the very least, not at all what you would expect from such a film about such a notable gangster. What this film is however, is truly something original. It doesn't always work, it has its fair share of flaws, tonal blurs, and a script that can be all over the place. What the film does have however, is Tom Hardy and Josh Trank, as well as the rest of the outstanding supporting cast. Tom Hardy truly gives a fantastic performance as the dementia ridden Capone, who is not only convincing as the character, but scarily similar. Other standouts include, but are not limited to, Linda Cardellini, Matt Dillon, and Jack Lowden. The film is quite often beautifully shot, and though its script can be quite hard to follow at times, it is truly a unique and personal point of view- that the audience may not always get, but for me, I always found quite interesting. It has its slower moments in pacing, but for the most part, Trank is able to keep the film just engaging enough to succeed. His direction is crucial to this film, although his writing can be a bit all over the place at times. I felt quite often like different parts of this film were written by different people. In the beginning, the lines read felt quite average, and in the center very complex, and towards the end, quite a thrilling and unforgettable odd experience. In the end however, despite its flaws, I enjoyed Capone for what it was, a refreshingly original look into the mind of the dying gangster, rather than focus on what I expected it to be, a gangster flick.
My Rating: 7.5/10",Capone
23,s3276169,A film with very little to say...,5,13 May 2020,"When a film has very little to say, the question becomes why was it made?I suspect ""Capone"" started out with a superficially interesting idea. Where it failed was not appreciating the ordinariness of the final days of any dying man.Ultimately all that's revealed is that death, no matter who it comes for, is un-glamorous and often ugly.Well that and the US government were and remain, a bunch of vile ravening vultures, little better than the ailing man they harass for money. Even going so far as to threaten his family.In simple terms then, ""Capone"" is neither easy to watch nor does it have a compelling message. Tom Hardy is predictably amazing as an ailing Capone, utterly convincing but its not enough, on its own.5/10 from me.",Capone
24,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Capone,7,17 May 2020,"""You can drop the act now"". Tom Hardy couldn't drop the act if he tried. In Capone (my latest review), Hardy plays Al Capone and becomes as usual, the consignment chameleon.Anyway Al Capone as a character, also goes by the tag Fonse (that's what everyone called him). Capone as a film, well it never has anyone saying his real name.So OK, as something about the final year of Al Capone's decrepit life, Capone is a nightmarish breadth of view and not your typical crime drama. Shot like a TV movie but lush and gaping in its tone, Capone doesn't care whether or not you embrace its fever dream vision (bloodied detached eyeballs as a horse head metaphor are included here).Now Capone does have a final, nasty shoot-'em-up with a gold-plated Tommy Gun. And yes, Fonse does make a few threats about cutting a poor soul's head off. But hey, Capone is not Scarface people. It's more a character study about a dude with dementia, a guy with neurosyphilis who can't control his own darn bowels. Third time director Josh Trank fashions Capone as a brute horror flick with an hallucinatory underbelly. He's not in the business of entertaining the audience. He'd rather sledgehammer his out of the box fancy.The cast of Capone is all good with Hardy's Fonse basically hugging the screen via a mugging scowl for the ages. He is backed up proficiently with work from Noel Fisher (his son Junior), Matt Dillon (his mysterious buddy Johnny), and Linda Cardellini (his sympathetic wife Mae). Their personas are like frustrated rogues just waiting for Al to peacefully be put out of his misery.All in all, Capone does do a good job of having shooting location New Orleans masquerading as Palm Tree-d, Palm Island, Florida. And yeah, the film's ominous score always gives you a foreboding feeling that something bad is about to happen.Bottom line: Capone at 104 minutes, could've been a little longer in length in order to provide more insight into this last days, true-life American gangster. But for what's abruptly on screen I'll take, even if it's cinematic ""hatchet man"". Rating: 3 stars.",Capone
25,elliotjeory,lol who made this,1,24 May 2020,A story nobody wanted to see. The idea of Hardy playing Capone is similar to Travolta playing Gotti. It could of been beautiful but instead it's terrible. No one wants to see the last year of Capone's life. It's beyond full and you will struggle to get through it. If you like Hardy pretend this film doesn't exist.,Capone
26,Xstal,A Cigar Smoking Castrated Cockerel...,4,12 May 2020,... from 'Happy Days' spirals into syphilitic insanity and reincarnates as a zombie wearing a nappy (or diaper).A film with very little value other than to remind us to eat our carrots and avoid crocodiles.,Capone
27,blott2319-1,Did Tommy Wiseau actually make this?,1,8 July 2020,"I'm completely stymied by Capone, and I cannot comprehend how any studio was willing to fund it. It is a film that is so terrible that it feels like it must be a joke. The whole idea of making a movie about Al Capone, but focusing entirely on his life after syphilis has begun to kill him and leads to multiple strokes, is just baffling. I feel bad for Tom Hardy if he thought this would be his road to an acting Oscar, because he's doing the whole thing where you ""get lost in the role"" when covered in elaborate prosthetics which make you look like a historical figure. It might have worked for Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour but all Tom Hardy gets to do here is mumble, groan, and occasionally shout out a line with a horrendous accent. He doesn't trick anyone into thinking they are watching Al Capone, he just seems like a grumpy old man fast approaching death. Even in the flashbacks or dream sequences, he has no life to him. You'd think this would be the opportunity for him to portray Capone as a dangerous gangster full of energy and vitality, but he still can barely put 3 words together and has drool running down his chin.The story of Capone is atrocious, and it makes me wonder if Josh Trank even understands how to write a script. At least half of the events in the film are complete hallucinations from Capone, including some characters, and it calls into question every single thing that happens. We constantly see things contradicting what we just watched, but even the reality makes no logical sense. In order to make this work you need a visual difference between the fantasy and the reality, or something like that so we can be grounded at one point and know we are watching something real. I'm not even sure how we're meant to feel when watching this film. Are we supposed to be sympathetic to Capone because he's suffering and might regret some of the awful things he did? Should I even root for him to find the money? I struggled to care about anything, and was begging for it to end. Even the most exciting/interesting parts of the movie were just dreams, so why get invested in anything. I feel like Capone could become one of those movies like The Room or Troll 2, where people enjoy watching because it is so inept that it is more fun to laugh at than trying to take it seriously. For me, it was so bad I didn't want to finish it.",Capone
28,brchthethird,"Less pathos, more pathetic",4,15 May 2020,"I must say I wanted to like this film when I first saw the trailer. Tom Hardy disappearing into another role in a period piece based on one of the most notorious people in history? Sign me up! Sad to say the execution of such a great premise went out with more of a whimper than a bang. The story concerns the final year in the life of Al Capone, mentally deteriorating from neurosyphilis at his Florida mansion. I will first lay out what I feel to be the strong points. The production design, costumes, and makeup were all great. Linda Cardellini does a fantastic job as Capone's long-suffering wife, Mae. The scoring was done well, and musically interesting in its own right. Good use is made of the operatic standard, 'Nessun dorma.' What I felt did not work was the choice to focus an absurd amount of running time on a pointless subplot about some possibly hidden cash that Capone stowed away before doing his prison term. Not only is there no payoff (SPOILER), but more time could have been spent humanizing Capone beyond Tom Hardy's relentlessly one-note performance, maybe showing more of the effect it had on the people surrounding him. However much I am hesitant about the vogue choice of humanizing our monsters, not delving deeper into that human drama feels like a missed opportunity. Instead we get aimless, wandering sequences that seem more interested in confusing the audience than actually conveying or provoking emotion. If there is one thing severely lacking in this film, it is pathos. This film ultimately left me numb. Overall, unless you are a Tom Hardy or Josh Trank superfan, I would skip this and go watch something else, e.g., THE UNTOUCHABLES or SCARFACE (the original one).",Capone
29,aciessi,Not as advertised.,6,19 August 2020,"Their greatest mistake was calling this film Capone. Otherwise, this is an interesting Art house film about Al Capone's descent into syphilis -fueled madness. I enjoyed it for a while. In its own sick way, Capone is entertaining. Tom Hardy is garbled as ever as the aging Capone. He goes all in, and it works. Since the film is so experimental, it's fatal flaw is how sloppy and incoherent it is. There is no real story here. It's just Al Capone and his melting brain. Watch it if you want, but don't go into this film thinking that it's a biopic. It is the farthest thing from it.",Capone
30,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A mess of a biopic that focuses on the wrong parts of Al Capone's life.,3,17 May 2021,"To give you a sense of the quality of this movie, I received a copy to own Capone (2020) for free from Redbox. The fact that Redbox was the distributor for this movie should have been the first indication of how bad it was going to be. At first, I figured, ""Oh, a movie about Al Capone. That should be interesting, right? And Tom Hardy is in it? He's done some great stuff."" How wrong I was. Now it's my job to warn you about it.Perhaps the director, Josh Trank, was to blame for this mess of a movie. Sure, his first film, Chronicle (2012), was pretty good, but Fantastic Four (2015) showed this to be a fluke, and Capone put the last nail in the coffin for his career. I mean, how can you take such an interesting historical figure like Al Capone (Tom Hardy) and focus on all the wrong parts of his life? On the other hand, maybe the goal was to humanize him by making the audience aware of the bodily failings of an older man? Whatever the case, the result was mostly just gross, confusing, and ultimately unentertaining.I can recognize that choosing to document the end of Al Capone's life is a bold choice. However, unless there are snippets of his illustrious past sprinkled throughout the film (in the form of flashbacks or other storytelling methods), it forces the audience to sit through the boring parts of this man's last days. And perhaps, that was the point? We can sometimes idolize villains like Al Capone, so watching his steady deterioration toward death can bring him down from the cultural pedestal we have collectively placed him on. Unfortunately, regardless of what was trying to be done here, it failed miserably.A mess of a biopic that focuses on the wrong parts of Al Capone's life, I give Capone 1.5 stars out of 5.",Capone
31,DarthVoorhees,An amazing concept for a film haphazardly brought to life...,6,1 June 2020,"This is one of those cases were the pitch for the movie is better than the finished project. 'Capone' stars Tom Hardy as the gangster in the last year of his life dying of neurosyphilis in his tacky Florida mansion. Once suave and charismatic Capone now chews on carrots instead of his phallic cigars and is incontinent in diapers. The film plays less like a slice of life bio pic and more like a Cronenberg horror film at times as Capone sees nightmarish visions of his past.
If I was a producer I would buy that pitch. It sounds absolutely brilliant but unfortunately 'Capone' is a case where there isn't enough material to sustain a movie. It's mainly about mood and ambiance and to be fair some moments are very effective but it doesn't quite stick the landing.
Hardy gives another performance that is bound to be divisive like his Bane. I could see this being a case like Jack Nicholson in 'Hoffa' where he received a Golden Globe and Razzie nomination.
For what it's worth this is the supposed comeback for Josh Trank of 'Fantastic Four' infamy. I can't speak to anything as I have not seen his 'Fantastic Four' or any of his past films and never intend to. He seems to be a capable enough behind the camera but the screenplay is lacking. The McGuffin of the film is Capone trying to remember whether or not he buried money.
Personally, and this is definitely me projecting my own wishes on the project I think it should have taken the other route and have been about Capone's deteoriating condition being his punishment for his life of crime and the wrong he did to his loved ones. Linda Cardellini as Capone's wife Mae gives the best performance in the film and that sort of storyline would have better utilized her talents.",Capone

34,MrDHWong,Does nothing to attempt to make such a well known crime figure's last days even remotely interesting to the audience,3,21 May 2020,"Capone is a biographical drama film edited, written, and directed by Josh Trank (Chronicle, Fant4stic) based on the life of the infamous gangster Al Capone. Starring Tom Hardy in the title role, it does nothing to attempt to make such a well known crime figure's last days even remotely interesting to the audience.After serving almost ten years in prison for tax evasion, the notorious Prohibition gangster Al Capone (Tom Hardy) is released into the custody of his family in Palm Springs, Florida. As he is suffering from a combination of neurosyphilis and dementia, Capone's mind is slowly deteriorating, causing him to hallucinate and lose the most basic of motor functions in his body. Convinced he is faking the whole thing, the FBI keeps Capone under constant surveillance, believing he is using this as a means to cover up his knowledge of where he has hidden over $10 million away from the public.By now, there have been several forms of media that depict Al Capone at certain points in his life, whether it be his upbringing, his rise to power, or his eventual arrest and detainment for tax reasons. Off the top of my head, I cannot recall any other film that shows Capone during his final years, where his mental state was rotting away to the point where he ended up with the brain capacity of a small child. It was a bold move to create a film like this to distinguish itself from all the others that make Capone out to be the notoriously dangerous gangster he was and I have a minimal degree of respect for the filmmakers in taking this different approach. However, this is where my praise for the film abruptly ends. Virtually everything else about it feels like a huge slog to sit through as the convoluted screenplay and terrible pacing ruin any moment that could be considered watchable. Scenes of Capone forgetting who he's talking to and later losing bowel movement while in bed were long and drawn out to the point of repetition. In addition to this, there were several missed opportunities to show Capone in a somewhat sympathetic light to remind the audience that he was still a flesh and blood human being despite the horrible crimes he committed. Rather, each time a moment like this was there, we were instead treated to constant surface level dementia hardships that only feel like they were there for padding purposes. An example of something that did this well was the 2004 German film ""Downfall"", which controversially showed Adolf Hitler in a vulnerable state during his last moments in spite of the atrocities he was responsible for. That film succeeded in showing some human-like aspects to Hitler, whereas this film fails spectacularly in doing the same for Capone, someone who carried out deeds almost as evil.Josh Trank, who returns to the director's chair after his terrible attempt at rebooting the Fantastic Four back in 2015, merely shows that he should probably just retire from filmmaking and be happy he has one good film under his belt, that being 2012's Chronicle. It is clear that Trank at least has some solid knowledge of Capone's life and character but has no idea how to convey this onscreen. As previously mentioned, instead of showing fleeting examples of sympathy to Capone's character, all we get are repetitive scenes of his lapses in brain activity and soiling himself. This went on for so long that it became increasingly boring to watch. You can only show so many scenes like this before the audience will lose interest and stop caring altogether, and this is especially a sad case when the subject matter is such a prominent figure of the gangster world.With an actor as talented as Tom Hardy in the lead role, he can at least be some saving grace, right? Wrong. Not once throughout the film did I ever believe Hardy was the infamous gangster, even though he was obviously doing the best he could with the material given to him. He mumbles and croaks his way through the film's weak dialogue and has hallucinations so surreal that even David Lynch would be scratching his head over what he has just seen. Worth mentioning as well was the poor use of makeup on Hardy's face so he would appear older and wrought with sickness. The entire time it looked as though someone just hastily powdered his face white before they started shooting and said ""That will be fine. No one will notice"". This stuck out to me as lazy and amateurish, especially when he is required to be in water, where the powder washed off and showed Hardy's natural skin colour.As I said, while I still respect that the filmmakers wanted to show something different regarding the life of Al Capone, it just wasn't worth it for this awful final product. It is especially frustrating that the potential is right there but it all went to waste due to the incompetence of its writer/director/editor. If you value your time or intelligence, avoid this one at all costs.I rate it 2.5/10",Capone

Proudly stated in the beginning of time, the first living thing crawls out of a crevouse and a top hat is put on it (by way of energy from the core). Hard to believe but most of us do not stare at photography of the sun. Thats what this thing did though (in the film). Looked at tons of raw photos of the sun (including a black and white pencilled depection of it). Now call me insane, but the best thing thats ever happened in my life was when i saw the end of this film. This thing sets itself down at the tattoo parlour to get a really large tattoo of the sun with the grin of an old man and emitting noise that sounds like 13 humans breathing at the same time.

37,ronakkotian,So what's the point?,4,12 May 2021,"After the disaster that was Fantastic Four, I wanted Josh Trank to make a comeback to prove his worth but sadly Capone didn't work for me.Capone follows Al Capone during his final days where he's dealing with dementia and hallucinations of his violent past.On paper this sounds like a very interesting idea. Taking one of the most notorious gangsters to ever exist and show him at the lowest point of his life has potential to turn into a very exciting film. However, Josh Trank's execution of this idea is very dull. For a film that's 1 hour 40 minutes long, not much happens. I found myself becoming very bored early on as Trank doesn't add much substance to make the film that engaging. I love Tom Hardy as an actor. Even if this film wasn't good, I felt I could've relied on Hardy at least to give a great performance but I'm very mixed on it. He tries very hard but I felt it was too over the top for me. He makes his way through the film mumbling his lines for the most part making it extremely difficult to understand what he's saying. Tom Hardy is known for mumbling in some of his other films but here it was too much.The editing was done by Trank himself and is very bad. There are many scenes where it cuts from shot to shot at odd times. This may have been done on purpose to show Capone's deteriorating state but it didn't make me feel anything towards him which makes me question as to what Trank was trying to communicate with this film. The tone is inconsistent as there are moments of humour as well as dark and dramatic moments so I didn't know how to feel throughout the film. We also meet characters that are later found to be in Capone's imagination. We're introduced to one in particular in a scene without Capone so it's hard to know how far Capone's imagination stretches since characters are established in scenes where he's not present. There is also a subplot involving a large amount of money hidden by Capone but that ends up going nowhere by the end.I really don't understand the point of the film. Apart from showing us the end of this man's life, I don't see the purpose behind it or why I should care for him. There is some good filmmaking involved which shows Josh Trank's skill but I was left very disappointed by the end result and wouldn't recommend it. If you want to see a fantastic depiction of dementia, I would highly recommend seeing The Father starring Anthony Hopkins.",Capone
38,danielmanson,"It's not too bad, but does have issues",6,6 March 2021,"Well reading the reviews on this film I was fully expecting a horror show. So many hate this film, calling it boring, saying it doesn't make sense and much more. And although I agree it isn't the best thing ever made. It definitely isn't ""bad"".Right I'll just list off my main major issues with this film and my biggest one is, to put it simply, that it just didn't need to be a film. People know Al Capone as this famous gangster, people want to see him doing gangster things, not wet his pants. But on a more serious note, I just don't think the story aspect was interesting enough to make a film out of it. At the end of the day a film needs to be entertaining and have a story that's engaging and keeps you hooked in. I don't believe this does and if you are expecting a different kind of film you won't enjoy this.A lot of the film are dream sequences. Aka stuff that doesn't actually happen. Now some are important because it's illustrating him losing his mind, but it's a good 50/60% of the film. Which again links to the above in that there isn't enough here to make a film.Character depth, especially in the family department is non existent. I think the film could have focused a lot more on the family and how they had to deal with him, but they didn't. Just handed you another dream sequence which meant nothing.Apologies for the long paragraph there. So I gave this film a 6/10 still. Why? Well, if you go into this film expecting to watch a slow burner and to watch Al Capone slowly get worse with illness then you will enjoy it more. You will enjoy the acting, you will enjoy the plot more, you will enjoy watching Capone's arc of getting worse and worse. But you need to know that's what you are watching, because I guarantee that a lot watched this with the anticipation of it being a biopic of his life and not just the final year.",Capone
39,latinfineart,A truly horrible mess of a film,2,12 May 2020,"I was absolutely astonished at how dreadful this film was. This movie was so convoluted. It was such a complete mess. The writing was terrible. The direction was like something that a first year film school student would put together. Although Tom Hardy is a great actor, he just didn't have much to work with as he was sort of bumbling through the entire movie. And bumbling is probably the best description for the entire production. There is no reason why this could could not have been an entertaining story. But the film makers appeared to have gone out of their way to sabotage everything that they touched. Other than the production, which was great. And the ending was one of the most ridiculous and also truly fictitious endings I've seen in a very, very long time. It was as if this director thought he was one of the Mexican magical realist director's. And fancied himself to be substantially above his pay grade.

Makeup does not help either. Capone was not a vampire.

However, it's just that the execution is very dull and sloppy. Like many directors who portray mental illness (paresis here), J. Trank seems to believe that narrative arbitrariness reflects his protagonist's disorientation, yet once that point is made there's nowhere for the film to go but in circles. Most aspects of the movie didn't really stand out, while the mystery here doesn't hold any suspense. Once Al Capone starts having hallucinations, the 10 millions subplot is sidelined so that T. Hardy can take center stage. Ultimately, I felt absolutely nothing watching this movie, I just had a numb viewing experience. A wild & colorful personality like Al Capone deserved a much more compelling story than this. It's difficult to see how this could have had much success in cinemas, so it's good for producers that world is having 2020 pandemic.Rating: 5-/4+",Capone
43,gsygsy,Ambitious,6,23 February 2021,"Writer/editor/director Josh Trank is to be commended for challenging himself as an artist. Choosing to tell the story of the last, crumbling year of Al Capone's life, when the man was befuddled through the effects of syphillis and stroke, Trank takes us into his protagonist's troubled mind as well as showing us his wilting body. Reality and delusion intertwine. It's occasionally unclear what's really going on. I'm not sure that matters too much, since we're not there for the plot so much as the overall experience.In the titanic title role is Tom Hardy, an actor who has made a speciality of portaying men in extremis. And sure enough, he gives a bravura performance, on an epic scale. There's a classy supporting cast, too, including Linda Cardellini, Matt Dillon, Kyle MacLachlan, Jack Lowther and Al Sapienza.For all the plusses, there's a touch of Tarantino-lite about the project: Mr Trask seems to lack the killer instinct that makes films like THE HATEFUL EIGHT so repulsive yet so compelling. Mr Trask, perhaps, simply has more heart. I'm hopeful that he can move away from superheroes and gangsters, towards the warmth that he's clearly interested in, but perhaps still wary of fully exploring.",Capone
44,TwistedContent,"Bizarre Enjoyment packed in a Flawed, but Bold Experiment",7,12 May 2020,"'Tis the day I had been waiting for a long time, and the reasons are many - a gangster film, a film specifically about Al Capone, and a film led by none other than Tom Hardy. Mr. Tom Hardy, as you may or may not know it, is one of my favorite, top-tier-in-my-book, long-time admired actors, ever since first seeing ""Bronson"" (2008). If not counting the one episode in the 5th season of ""Peaky Blinders"", it's been a dry stretch of no Hardy, and, my oh my, 2nd season of ""Taboo"" will soon have taken three years to come out. Today, however, is a great day, as Josh Trank, director of ""Chronicle"" and the controversial ""Fantastic Four"", has come back effortful and more independent, together with Tom Hardy showcasing the doom and gloom of a gangster in his twilight hours.""Capone"" is an interesting movie to say the least, it's as unique as it is overplayed, as serious as it is hilarious, as deep as it is surface level. Part B flick, part nutty borderline-art-house oddity - kind of stuff that always jives well with me. Whoever's looking for some bizarre joy, this is a good source. 47-year old Alphonse Gabriel Capone has come home after 10 years in prison, and is spending his last months rotting away with dementia and physical problems caused by neurosyphilis. As he becomes worse, the line between reality and delusion gets blurred, and past demons come out to haunt.Josh Trank may not have come back with a knockout, but ""Capone"" proves skill on his side, as well as effort and dare. Instead of re-imagining the multiple times told most famous endeavors of Al Capone, Trank chooses to depict the decaying dawn of the notorious gangster, trying to tackle the heavy themes of morality and mortality. Hardy and Trank seems to be very much on the same page, for the script and atmosphere goes hand in hand with the performance when it comes to gloom, somberness and misery. There's a good share of fever dreams, messy psychology, confusion - devices, which, sadly, shouldn't play such a big role in being a substitute for plot. Trying to differ in the niche of gangster epics, and going deep in the mentality behind a morally corrupted man suffering, ""Capone"" loses touch with many important elements of a movie, puts too much focus on gangster's physical decline, and struggles to pinpoint its comment on the morality behind him, sometimes feeling bleak in favor of pointlessness. ""Capone"", being a little lost in itself, is not as compelling as it hoped to be, and it may not make you feel good for the man, but it succeeds at making him human. Despite the fair amount of flaws, every one of them feels like counterbalanced with a goodie or another - it is undeniably entertaining and interesting seeing a gangster movie dipped in a different kind of sauce.As a movie about the dawn of a gangster and what such a character/person experiences and goes through, it is unfortunate for ""Capone"" to come in the shadow of ""The Irishman"". There aren't that many movies specifically about the ending part of a gangster life, and these two happen to be recent, and ""The Irishman"", in that matter, is much more focused, deeper and way less flawed.Last point of bother regards to previously said ""as serious as it is hilarious"" - there were moments when I was thinking, is there a bit of a parody at play, and is it self-acknowledged. The dramatism, but mostly some of the method madness grotesque antics of Hardy's Capone, can raise eyebrows. Personally, loved it.
I heard a guy saying how Hardy could be, in a way, the next Nicolas Cage. And here's the thing, I don't know what your thoughts on him are, but Nic Cage is another guy I love and admire, and I think it's a fact, he's a lot better actor than most consider him. I could talk a lot about this, the what's and why's and how's, but my point here is, when I heard this comparison, I was like yeah, I actually can see that, just with an entirely different view than that guy had. Hardy does, in a lot of his performances, put up a similiar kind of madness, energy and flair, and, as far as I'm concerned, it's the good stuff, the kind I never can get enough of. Capone, as scripted in this vision, is a challenging role, and Hardy, naturally, gives it his all, if perhaps going on in it without any functioning brakes. I feel like overall somewhat overblown appearance of the movie as a whole cannot be blamed on the lead performance though, because the script really was mostly about that - going mad, appearing crazy, feeling confused.The rest of the cast, though with such names like Matt Dillon, Kyle MacLachlan, Noel Fisher and Linda Cardellini, is given very little to do, with the most probably going to Matt Dillon, who's ""The House that Jack Built"" has impactfully changed my whole view on him, and for the better. In this specific sense, ""Capone"" reminded me of ""Joker"", and how the whole focus of them is, if compared to most movies, on a singular character, and by a huge margin. Nevertheless, not one bad acting performance in both of them.Another thing ""Capone"" has going for it is its cinematography, consistently solid, well composed, and not the department it feels like a B movie in. I also very much liked the original score, very subtle, low, rumbling, lurking and in symbiosis with the atmosphere goals of ""Capone"".""Capone"" is probably the most flawed movie Hardy has led since ""Bronson"" (not counting 2012's ""This Means War""), but that means nothing when everyone involved goes full in anyways. Josh Trank's third feature is a bold attempt, an unordinary character study with troubled execution, and a playground that allows Hardy to go mad. My rating: 7/10. I believe a re-watch will be granted.",Capone

Considering all the death and destruction Capone was responsible for, it feels like karma in action.The film is annoying and even comical at times. It is like sitting through two hours if an anti smoking commercial with a person talking through a tracheotomy. Some might find the scene of him wandering around in a dirty diaper shooting a machine gun humorous or even poignant. He does spend most of the film losing control of his bowels.",Capone
46,SnobReviews,Tom Hardy gives his all in this train wreck.,2,15 May 2020,"While you can't deny Tom Hardy's physical transformation and efforts, ""Capone"" as a whole is an absolute train wreck never truly coming together the way it should.
.
In this crime drama based on a true story, after serving 10 years in prison, mobster Al Capone starts suffering from dementia and is haunted by his violent past.
.
First of all, normally Tom Hardy is known for his mumbling characters and distinct voices, but in ""Capone"" you can barely make out what the hell he's saying. Another thing; if you're gonna use a foreign language sporadically through a film, make sure it's authentic. When these characters spoke Italian, I wanted to rip my eardrums out for how bad it was. The story takes place at a pivotal moment in Al Capone's life and I felt this film barely even touched the surface. An ineffective and mind-numbing crime drama that deserved way better.

47,Rendanlovell,What is even happening,3,14 May 2020,"The film is rough as is. This movie relies so heavily on the later year Al Capone that it desperately needed a strong leading performance. Unfortunately Tom Hardy is awful. He is trying so so hard but he's just terrible. He's simultaneously way over the top and completely unintelligible. His whole performance is literally grunts. There are so many biographies out there that have landed actors Oscars for their performances but Tom Hardy might be closer to nabbing a razzie. It's unfortunate because there is something here. It's odd that Josh Trank came back from near career suicide to make a biography but he seems to be at least attempting something. Most of the movie is about Al Capone slowly going more and more insane. He seems haunted by his past life. Seeing visions of his son Tony wandering around or flashbacks to horrible events in his life. I just don't know what it was meant to be. Is it supposed to show him coming to terms with his regrets in life? If that's the case then why does it go actually nowhere? What role was this supposed to play here? These nightmarish sequences are so trite at this point it's hard to even enjoy them as their own thing. They serve no purpose and are done to death. This kills the pacing. It's an absolute slog to get through. It's not even 2 hours but feels like double that thanks to these scenes that lead nowhere. It's a mostly frustrating experience endcapped by Hardy being truly bad. However, there are some ideas I liked in this. I like the idea of showing one of the most notorious gangsters in history as a bed wetting degenerate. I also like seeing some of the delusions he is having. Matt Dillon's character springs to mind as the most compelling part of the movie. That said, none of this even makes up for Tom Hardy who single handedly pulls this movie down. If you take him out of the equation it's mostly just a boring, slightly uninspired biography about an aging gangster.",Capone
48,chubarova,Not all expected.,7,21 May 2020,"When this film was announced, all expected the film about dangerous gangster with shooting, blood and murders. Actually, this film is not about the best time in Al Capone's life. Firstly, the plot tells about the last year in Capone's life. We see the man with big problems with his health. Sometimes it looks very disgusting and ugly. Secondly, the cast is good, but this film carries on Tom Hardy's play, he is awesome.
So, it's good film about man who died on your eyes but not about dangerous gangster.",Capone

To make a movie that takes place after everything that made Capone Capone and replace shoot outs and dramatic court room scenes with scenes of him wetting himself and instead of something like the famous horse head scene from The Godfather It's a scene of Capone crapping the bed. The Capone story is well known and with at least 10 movies based solely on him new ground is hard to come by but that's no reason to make a movie about the last year of Capone who at this point can't separate real life and STD induced hallucinations. Tom Hardy is a great actor and I'd watch him in nearly anything, but this movie should never have been made, it's pointless and it's story didn't need to be told.",Capone

53,PetarNeo,Hour and forty minutes of madness,8,12 May 2020,"Unfortunately during this pandemic there is a lack of theater experience that is definitely lacking for this movie. Al Capone, probably the most famous american gangster, in his final years as we have never even imagined or had idea show from the eyes of Trank is something that you will either appreciate or be disgusted and hate it because it is just that kind of a movie.It's hard to talk about movie without spoiling something because it has interesting viewing on some points that asks audience to be witness and engage in assessment of what is happening and why. Capone is the movie that will make people go bonkers and make them sick, but at the other hand if you really appreciate you are there for some action and you need to know that movie will try to play games with you. Sometimes you might feel like you are not following that is happening and that might be the only major problem of the movie but once you realize where are you and who is who and what is what it becomes pretty straight forward.Tom and Linda both work great together as she is portraying a loving and caring wife that is worried about him and at the same time Tom is there to make her life difficult. There will be a debate hold on Tom's performance is he good or is he bad, is he grunting too little or too much, how sane is he actually and finally is it worst or is it classic Hardy performance that you would expect. All considering if you are a fan of Tom he will not disappoint you, you will have it all, his eyes, his grunting, his talking, full blown method acting. Sometimes it's not for faint-hearted but mostly it is about the truth and it looks pretty wild and mad.Josh Trank is finally coming back and hopefully he will have more to offer in the future, because there is something about Trank that is unique and in the future if he's given a chance he might prove to everybody how talented he actually is.It's mad, disgusting, crazy, disturbing and fun experience at the end. 3/4",Capone

57,aleksanderk-95350,Very Boring,2,26 March 2021,Of all the parts of Capone's life. They pick the most boring part of his life to put on screen. By the end of this film it goes nowhere. Capone craps his pants twice. Who in the word wants to see that in a movie. Most of the Characters get no development besides Capone. The jumping back between the real world and Capone dreaming. Was very dumb it made no sense nd it did not build any suspension or twist. Don't waste your time on Capone.,Capone
58,carlos-pires,Completely uninteresting and uninspired waste of time,1,14 May 2020,"Yes, this is a Hollywood product with good actors, sets, locations, music score, etc.
But the subject matter is completely uninteresting and the script and the direction are completely uninspired. You can tell that the director loves ""The Godfather"" and ""The Shining"" because he more than borrows from these movies on more than a couple of occasions, but besides the stuff he borrows from those two masterpieces, he brings nothing original or remotely interesting. There's a couple of plot/script gimmicks that are so cliché that are simply childish.Last but not least, in spite of Tom Hardy being a great actor, in this movie you can frequently find him trying too hard. 90% of the time he is just grunting ""Meh"". It's pointless if this portrayal of a demented old Capone is actually true to the facts, because it comes across as simply ridiculous, ruining any narrative value the meagre script had in the first place.Bottom line: a complete waste of time.",Capone

The scenery is beautiful and occasionally you witness an interesting situation but eventually you realize that neither you nor the guide know how this trip will end. He is putting the utmost effort every step of the way to keep you engaged and just when you think that you are about to understand why you are here... poof... the trip is over.This is what Capone feels like. In an attempt to portray the final year of the infamous gangster struggling with his sickness, the film starts and ends without achieving anything. It constantly keeps you wondering where is it going just to end without getting anywhere. Technically, it is well made and has some fascinating moments which work solely because of Hardy who embraces the old, demented gangster to perfection.The movie is 90 minutes so I wouldn't say I hated it because Hardy was enough to make it bearable for such a short duration. However, unless you are fine with watching a movie purely for a crazed Tom Hardy prancing about the scene, avoid this film as it will not enrich your life in any way.",Capone
62,vailsy,so weird they decided to focus solely on this part of Al Capone's life,3,29 August 2020,"I fully knew what I was getting into watching Capone since I'd already read some things about it and was not expecting an action movie but, still .... For about 5 seconds in a mirror you see what could have been had Tom Hardy played Al Capone in an interesting movie detailing, at least partially, Capone during his 'Hay Day'. This surely would have been a great portrayal of Capone, maybe better even than De Niro's effort in the UntouchablesSo weird then that this project focused completely on the final year of his life where he was pooping his pants. I'll back Tom Hardy for anything but I don't think there is an actor out there that could have pulled off pant pooping and shoot outs in diapers with alligators without it being comedic, and that includes Hardy. All that stuff worked with Bronson for example because it embodied the character being portrayed, but in a Capone movie it's funny when it shouldn't bePerhaps this would have worked had they shown some of his previous life in flashback form since that would have grounded the final year weirdness. It would have been more conventional yes, but way better too.Capone unfortunately is a tremendous waste of time, money and potential",Capone

64,Breumaster,The Downfall of an American Icon,7,3 June 2021,"In countless movies Capone is glorified as the leading gangster, as an unbeatable, ruthless and cold hearted predator, which ever wins. But this movie is based on more human aspects and is a view on the formerly feared gangster when the rush of success vanished. Tom Hardy portrayed Al Capone as the nursing case he was at the end. I don't know if the movie is completely accurate. I read some articles and his wikipedia-site to know enough about Capone's end. In the end it is what happens to all, who walked of the path of the righteous man. A life with fear, guilt and wistfulness follows. Many people knew that he died from a kind of Syphilis. But this movie shows more; the whole palette of his suffering. So why do I give only 7 of 10?It's hard to see these long winded scenes of suffering, which are made in a strong symbolical way. There are so many scenes which try to draw his inner feeling when it comes to rememberances. This flood of images is sometimes a little glutinous. And the amount of these scenes is a little too much. It is not a typical mafia movie many people would prefer, even though it has it's qualities. So I totally understand that people who prefer movies like Scorsese's epics, are disappointed.

One of the only few good things I can say about the story, it had some decent dark elements, with some gritty action, but overall it was just dull & boring.Tom Hardy is usually really good with selecting his productions, but he dropped the ball here, putting on an unnecessary over the top performance; coming from a huge Tom Hardy fan, it's like salt in an open wound saying that. Tom Hardy tries his best here, and I mean REALLY tries his best, but with poor direction, writting, and a really distracting voice approach, his character was essentially underdeveloped, and uninteresting. As far as the rest of the cast, Josh Trank did a great job casting this brilliant cast, but everyone, like Hardy, was super underdeveloped and one dimensional.The script was real boring and missed on every single emotional note they tried to hit. This humor approach Trank went for seemed really odd and out of place, and seemed to really screw with the tone of the film.Overall, I really wanted to like this movie, but with such an underdeveloped project, dull cinematography & writting, Josh Trank & the crew should've spent more time at the drawing board on this one.",Capone

Al Capone (Tom Hardy), was just released from prison for being deemed ""not dangerous"" and is now starting his new life out of prison with very crippling form of dementia.REVIEW:
This film was about as interesting as the synopsis I gave. It was about as pointless as an hour and forty minute film about peeling an orange. If this film was reincarnated as a human it would be named ""Holy S***idontcare."" I feel bad for even bringing holy into this.Okay, let me give some real criticisms. First, I'll say Tom Hardy was brilliant. The best performance I have ever seen from him. The transformation he underwent for this was so damn good. I believed he truly had dementia and everything from the voice to him speaking Italian was spot on. Now, it's just really unfortunate that this performance came in such a terrible film. The writing was all over the place I had no idea what was happening through the film. This felt like someone trying to take revenge on Capone and just make him look absolutely pathetic for the awful crimes he committed. I don't think anyone really cared to see this, he's dead and we all hoped he had a struggling life after, but I don't think anyone cared to see it. Then when you didn't think this film could be worse than it already is, there's a subplot about the FBI or somebody trying to get information on him for whatever reason and some other plot about a bag of money and yada yada this film was garbage I can't even talk about it anymore.-10/10 for the film. 11.5/10 for Tom Hardy. 1.5/10.",Capone

They contemplate the object as it is in itself and ""apart from all interest."" But, for me, in this work of Josh Trank there was not much of that type of experience! There was annoying experience, disgusting experience, experience of boredom, experience of putting up with someone doing their job half way!

His acting brilliance shines not only on the big screen but in superb TV dramas such as Taboo but in almost all he plays the role we know him best for, a mean lean fighting machine. When I first heard Tom Hardy would be portraying Al Capone I was instantly excited to see just how much carnage and chaos he would reign throughout the film, but Instead we got an old guy shouting at crocodiles and wearing diapers. The acting was once again brilliant from Hardy but simply put, it's not the film we wanted. Sometimes the simplest option is the best and I think we all would have throughly enjoyed a film about Capone in his prime but we get a shell of a man and a shell of a film.

84,dan_slentz,Reel Tunez Review: Slow Movie... Numbing... And Leaves You with Mixed Emotions!,4,22 May 2020,"Reel Tunez Movie Review (5/21/20): ""Capone""Tom Hardy stars as Al Capone.. in the days after he's released from Alcatraz.. for tax evasion!
The movie takes place pretty much at Capone's house (on Palm Island.. between Miami & Miami Beach.. the house is still in this gated community on a group of islands). There are flashback scenes, but they are not ""memories"" but ""nightmare"" Capone has while the Neurosyphilis destroys his brain.No spoilers.. but in real life, Capone refused to admit he had an STD for fear of his wife finding out (who ended up getting it). He wouldn't get treated.. and finally did when penicillin came out, which stopped the spread but at that point his mind had been wasted. Capone died at the age of 48.So what about this movie? It wasn't great. It was okay. It had ""artsy vibes"" quite a bit of the time and tried to paint the disturbing picture of what it was like for Capone as his mind deteriorated. Here's the problem (at least for me): Capone was a vicious killer.. and this disease (which he COULD have treated) slowly destroys an individual. So WHERE do your emotions land with a movie like this? Feel sorry for him? You certainly feel sorry for an individual going through what he did (including losing control over bodily functions over and over in this movie). So the movie leaves you mixed between ""serves a killer right"" and ""poor man that is suffering"".The story felt pretty incomplete.. like it wasn't told with enough info to be accurate or even truly interest you. Seemed almost more of a medical training film with what was happening.I'd put this on the ""skip it"" list. On a 1 to 10 scale, I give this a 4.I'll end with this. Being someone who has had bit parts in movies and even worked on a few, I always hate to give anything less than a glowing review for a movie. The actors put a LOT of work into movies. The production crews ALL put a LOT of work into movies. Movies are NOT easy to make and the process can be long, drawn-out, and painful. So I'm disappointed I couldn't give this a better review or anything higher than a 4 star rating.Reel Tunez.. The Radio Show All About the Movies.",Capone

And that's the reason i don't think he has even put in for Bond, which is a shame.We sat down to watch this film, and Steph said to me, i am in the mood for some violent gangster film, we hope to go to Chicago in October.20mins in, she was bored, so I had to watch the rest on my own, this is not a gangster film, it's a human drama based on truth. It's a very tough watch, it's not for people who are suffering from Depression, it's a film that makes you feel very low in my opinion.It's all about the money, at the end of the day.I am surprised this was not offered to De Niro, who of course in the Untouchables was just brilliant as Capone, maybe De Niro did not want it? Or maybe they felt that Hardy was so Brilliant as both of the Krays, that this was made for him.Yes it's slow, it's a film you have to watch every scene, and it's not am easy watch

Tom Hardy makes it interesting enough as a bold and brilliant actor to keep people entertained as well as some of the other cast.

I need to see Capone as a character to empathize with IN SOME WAY before I'm supposed to care when he has a debilitating stroke halfway through and is paralyzed and becomes even more primal.I hate to say it but, it needed to be longer, get rewritten and reconstructed in general to even maybe be good.

94,thomasmitilis1995,"A MAN WHO SPENDS HIS ENTIRE LIFE LYING TO EVERYONE ABOUT EVERYTHING, THE TRUTH ROTS IN THERE...",2,30 May 2020,"PROS:
~Josh Trank should be given credit for attempting to take a different approach by presenting the notorious gangster in his decline.
~Although she is criminally underused, Linda Cardellini is brilliant as the wife of Capone. Through her eyes you see the pain watching her husband going through all that but also the tiredness of constantly being a caretaker. The best scene of the movie is when she slaps her husband in the face.
~The production design is amazing (especially the house) and the cinematography is beautiful for the most part. The use of gold (balloon, gun etc) is smart and symbolizes that despite his wealth, nothing can save him from his disease.
~The scene where Capone shoots a alligator because of frustration or the one where he is disguised as a woman show how insane things a gangster can do.CONS:
~Tom Hardy maybe gives the weakest performance of his career. He is ridiculously over the top and feels more like a caricature than a real person. He is grunting and drooling all the time. The scenes where he is pooping(twice), wearing a diaper or putting a carrot on his mouth like Bugs Bunny give the film a parody vibe instead of capturing his paranoia.
~The script is scattered and incoherent. The subplot with his second son is so underdeveloped and unnecessary and the final shot with him looking the sky is anticlimactic.
~The most uninteresting storyline is the one about the hidden money. The characters of Jack Lowden and Kyle MacLachlan are here to enhance this plotline but in the end they offer nothing special. As a result boring subplots like this distracts you from the real purpose of the film which is the depiction of Capone's paranoia and demise.
~The hallucination scenes are intolerable. The torture scene looks as an excuse for including a brutal scene in the movie. Matt Dillon's character or the child version of Capone is used as a vehicle to show the remorse of the main character but you never feel this. It would be better if the movie dedicated a part of the screen time to show the best period of his life in order to understand better the character.
~The makeup on the face of Capone is excessive (he is a human being with a serious illness, not Emperor Palpatine) and the lighting doesn't help either.",Capone
95,MackMonMay87,"Underrated: Not a Gangster Biopic, Not What People Expected",7,16 May 2020,"The biopic is a safe Hollywood bet that studios, producers, and filmmakers love. Take a historical figure and/or someone well known, cast a well-liked dramatic actor and fill the script with the typical beats of rising up from mediocrity or poverty, show their struggle and talent, their triumphs, the moments where they become who we know them to be, and then their downfall or their age.This is a tried and true formula that the movie industry loves, and every year, there's at least one of these, usually about music artists, but also sometimes about athletes or other outstanding pop culture figures, and in some cases, criminals. ""Capone"" with Tom Hardy directed by Josh Trank follows none of these familiar beats and doesn't play to any of these well-worn expectations.I think one of the reasons this movie has so many low ratings is due to viewers who love The Godfather, Scarface, Goodfellas, and the long line of classics in the gangster subgenre having their expectations subverted when they encountered a slower paced, methodical, sad, strangely comedic, offbeat portrayal of a feared member of America's criminal underworld at his lowest point: desperately trying to hang on to the man he used to be while suffering from the ravages of Syphilis.A lot of people love to see gangsters get away with crime, rise to power, and to see a film that glamorizes a life of crime, and that's not what you get here. Maybe this was misadvertised, but I saw a performance from Tom Hardy that captured the pain and frustration of being trapped in a body that's betraying you, all the while surrounded by people you're not sure you can trust, with the memories of the past turning from pleasant to nightmarish in the space of a second.The film is for the most part beautifully shot with sometimes an almost horror-movie level of suspense, and the idea of what is and isn't real is played with, bringing you into Capone's mindset in his last few months.
It's not a perfect film, and is slow moving at points, but Hardy's performance always reels everything back in. The make-up on him is incredible, and you can't tell me that you see Hardy here. So often anymore, we see moviestars, but not an actor disappearing into a part.One of the main flaws of the film for me was that it does expect the viewer to have a firm grasp on who Capone was, what he did, and how he rose to power, because none of that content that you'd see in a typical gangster film is there. It might have been nice to have more scenes of Hardy as Capone in his prime, but the idea that it only gives you a few memories brings you into the headspace he's in: he wants desperately to be that man again but can't.Al Capone was a violent man and unforgiving to many, but this movie does a great job of painting him as sympathetic, that showing that even the worst people have family that can be agonized from watching someone they love deteriorate right in front of their eyes.There could've been more of the other perspective explored, how the FBI or perhaps the families of his rivals and victims viewed him, to balance the perspective we see in the film, and a few questions the film poses, such as whether or not his dementia was an act the whole time or not could've been explored more deeply, but I feel that everything in this was made as an effort to defy the formula and try a different approach.Go into this expecting to see some outstanding character-acting from Hardy, and not expecting a gangster movie. It's not a tribute to that, it's not a glorification, there's plenty of other movies that fetishize outlaws for that. I give this points for trying something new in exploring a dark chapter in the life an American public figure. This approach might not have been perfect, but I hope that it encourages more creativity and more of a boldness to move away from formula in the future.",Capone

Fair enough it tries to capture the dwindling physical, mental & psychological health of the last year of Fonzo's life, but dragging the audience through the same confusion he's experiencing just creates a very considered mess.Those who enjoyed the film are summarising that the reason people didn't enjoy the film is because it wasn't a violent Goodfellas, Untouchables, Godfather movie.

I truly do not understand why this ever got made. A 10 minute version of this story at the end of a comprehensive Capone biopic as an epilogue would be warranted, but not the entire movie devoted to his last year. And apparently they thought it was fun to jump back and forth between what was real and what was imagined. One specific example: Capone falls in the water, then he gets violently sucked under, then comes up in perhaps Italy, but he is completely bald (he only time in the movie) and this kid he sees on occasion is on the shore smiling at him, then end scene.

On the contrary, though Trank made a decent job writing and directing (and he obviously needs to mature on both), his job as editor proves he is less than qualified to do such task.The other issue I found in this long-waited film was that some parts aren't clear whether are real or Capone's imagination, so the script failed in drawing the line between both sides.",Capone

Moody, atmospheric, almost feels like you're slowly being drawn into the madness in Capone's mind. This was complimented by great cinematography. There were also some truly moving scenes, and as someone who has been personally affected by dementia they were quite emotional. Tom Hardy's performance was mostly incoherent grunts yet he finds a way to portray Capone's crippled mind quite well. Overall acting was good.Where this movie completely falls short is that it fails to achieve the emotional impact it could by weighing itself down with a long, drawn out, and often pointless story and dialogue. As a viewer I felt like I was suffering a mental illness as I tried to find the point of most scenes. It could have been so much better with more focused storytelling and structure. Instead it felt like it just meandered on with no succinct destination. If you want an art house type film that feels more like a fever dream than a story then this might be for you.I hate to give this movie such a low review due to its other great aspects, but I feel that it completely missed the mark and wasted so much potential.

Tom hardy can be good and great, but he can also be wrong for certain movies. He is not perfect for every role, come on..stop the worshiping please.I think they would have made a better choice using Stephen Graham or maybe Glenn Fleshler.It is never good if you keep switiching your mind from the real character and the actor who is supposed to the character.

His wife Mae (Cardellini) has to maintain order on his palatial estate and keep her ailing husband from hurting either himself or everyone else. There's dream sequences, hospital visits, bureaucratic meetings, and perhaps the strangest gunfight one will see in a gangster film ever. You'll know what I mean when you see it.The plot itself is just an excuse for Josh Trank to exercise in some bizarre storytelling choices and make audiences watch Tom Hardy transform into a human vegetable through impressive makeup and physical acting. And good lord, is there some body horror in Tom Hardy's physical transformation into the infamous gangster who's been rendered helpless by syphilis. His dedication to the most disgusting parts of his illness are commendable but the effect is grotesque and often sickening. Linda Cardellini is actually good here as his loyal but suffering wife who is forced to watch her husband's severe mental decline. The anguish and frustration on her end seems genuine and heartfelt.The editing is very bizarre. A lot of scenes you think are happening in real time are actually in Al Capone's mind. On the one hand, that is kind of interesting as viewers become passengers during Capone's mental deterioration. But on the flip-side, the narrative becomes cyclical. Al Capone is sick, dream sequence, his wife is upset. Rinse and repeat. But oddly enough, it's a beautifully shot movie. The cinematography is good and the direction doesn't make it look cheap.Apparently director Josh Trank hoped this would become his comeback movie after the failure of Fantastic Four (2015).

I love Matt Dillon's role. They should have used him more like a ghost of Christmas past character. Showing how Al Capone rose to power, prospered and fell.
The story was weak in my opinion. I understand what they were trying to convey with the old deranged Capone plot but it would not have been the story I would have chosen if I was the producer. I would have kept the old deranged Al Capone plot but also add in flashbacks more often and for a purpose. It would have been best to highlight his childhood(very briefly), his rise to power and downfall. This wouldn't have to be an integral part of the movie just a series of flashbacks maybe a 1/2 hour of film time (at the most) which could be interwoven with the ""present"" (old senile paranoid al). The flashbacks would hint at where the 10 million dollars might be. And then at the end it gets confirm that hes just crazy and there's no 10 million dollars lol.

Tom Hardy gives a great performance as the confused, struggling, and powerful crime boss. He struggles with his health, his past, and the line between reality and illusion. The film immerses the viewer in Capone's world and confusion, and this, perhaps, is why this film was not well received. The viewer feels like Capone- confused about what is real and what is in his mind. The supporting cast of Noel Fisher, Linda Cardellini, Matt Dillon, and Kyle McLachlan are all very good.

I think it's because this movie never once glorifies him in any way for any moment the way other movies do. I don't want to say bad things about this movie because it is a dedicated effort, but nothing is really happening that makes me want to watch. The only plot is that they're trying to find some of the last of his lost money. But, it is so, so boring. Not much else accomplished by this movie besides making the lesser known point that Al Capone's life ended in dementia, and this point is very long and drawn out.",Capone

The story is about the last year of calpone's life when he has lost it mentally and physically. This was the worst part of his life not to mention the most boring! Nothing actually happens! I would give this a miss if you haven't already watched!,Capone
123,IndieZeus,Capone,7,9 March 2021,Tom Hardy gives an interesting performance but despite a few good scenes and fantasy sequences the film never quite takes off.Not sure if the end of Capone's life when he had dementia really needs a whole movie devoted to it rather then just a section of a movie.,Capone

126,jmrecillas-83435,"This is not a mastrerpiece, but is a challenge for everyone",7,30 July 2020,"I guess people expected the usual biopic of a criminal gangster, as Hollywood has portrayed them always: powerful, elegant, merciless, almost if they were role models for people. Since gunslighters of the good old Wild West, American people love criminals, and for that is not surprise that in the land of the excess, Serial Killers and other dispicable people are almost heroes. So when someone presents not a romantic and glamorous perspective on some criminal, they don't like and speak about waste of time and similr terms on this product.I think that is against this film. This is a film that dares you to look what happen on a criminal mind after imprisonment and years of mental illness. In the end, that is what is about this movie: what happen after years and years of drugs and alcohol abuse in the mind of a criminal. It cannot be romantizised, it cannot be glamorous or full of luxury. It's the sad end years of a despicable man, a criminal that not deserves to be portrayed in such a usual and customized way.In that sense, this film doesn't have precedents and is understanding that people turn their back on it. Its not the kind of romantic portrate of a gangster. But I think deserve more intelligence and critical appraisal than has received. It is more simple to reject something we don't understand, than use the brain and understand the subject and the way is approaching. Bad guys end bad, and this film shows it brutally. Tom Hardy delivers an impresisve performance of a man who see how he has lost literally his mojo, and his mind wander as if wasn't in control. I guess they want to him in Armani suits like Robert De Niro in Untouchables. Well, this is not the case.This is not a mastrerpiece, but is a challenge for everyone.",Capone
127,marksez,Incredibly Lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnng and Sloooooooooooooooooooow and Painful to watch,2,4 October 2020,"Occasionally I watch a movie and wonder, ""How in the heck did this movie get made?""This is one such movie. I can't imagine a director, producer, and production staff screening the production version of this movie and thinking it as anything close to good.A movie about Al Capone, at any stage of his life, would potentially be interesting if it told us something about Capone as a person, gave us insight into his character, and told us some interesting history. This movie does none of that.This is a movie of lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng silences. The phone calls that some one answers and no one on the other end of the line speaks until there has been a lonnnnnnnnnnng pause. The scenes where nobody speaks for a lonnnnnnnng time. The long periods of nothingness simply add more nothingness to an empty story. Were the creators of this film paid by the minutes of film?This movie uses all the movie devices, rain and then more rain, cute innocent kids, stereotypical mob guys, stereotypical feds, stereotypical house help, the big dream sequence (the only real action in the entire movie), etc. And horrible make up.Any of these overused devices can be overlooked in a well-acted, well directed, well told movie. This movie has none of these qualities.Al Capone, I am sure in his heyday, was an interesting and violent character that would (and has quite often) made a great movie personality.Here we see only a demented and empty old man (who is only 47). Maybe Big Al was like this in his final days. If he was, he wasn't much to see.Why did people invest money in making this movie, and who did they think would enjoy seeing it?So, I am back to the original question, ""How in the heck did this movie get made?""I'm giving this movie 2 stars because the scenes and scenery are well shot.",Capone

134,swowen-84128,The Capone story not depicted in the movies,8,18 June 2020,"So this movie depicts the life that the once Main Man, The Don, The Gangster, Scarface, Alphonse Gabriel Capone leads follows being released from an 11 year stay at a United States Penitentiary.
Al Capone or Fonz (played by Tom Hardy), has left prison, after being caught for tax evasion. He is now in his mid 40's and has been released from prison, as the authorities now do not deem him as a threat. Capone has now moved away from the hustle bustle of Chicago for one of the homes that he had while he was the most feared gangsters of his time. The problem for Capone is that he is suffering from untreated neurosyphilis and also has entered stages of dementia. So he is now only a shadow of that feared mobster prior to the prison sentence. Now retired and living with his wife Mae (played by Linda Cardellini) and son Junior (played by Noel Fisher) in their Florida home, Capone has lost all of those allies and friends he had when things were ""good"". He has a few bodyguard's and family members and close friends that are within reach. With the way that his illnesses are attacking his body, we see Fonz, going downhill, his bodily functions are failing him as he has the occasional bladder or bowel malfunction. Mae cares for him as much as she can with the help of some of the family and friends that are left. He has become very paranoid of people watching him, while smoking his cigars and sitting in the chair in the house or outside in the garden looking across his garden full of his beloved statues he thinks he sees people. Does he?Or is it the illnees? Its not paranoia though, as the FBI, since his release have a theory that Fonz has hidden some of the money he had $10 million to be precise, so they have teams of officers all around the property, in vans with listening devices picking up conversations in the bugged house, in case that Fonz tells someone where the money is. Fonz's mind does start to play tricks on him as we see him being tortured by his past experiences and being very confused. Matt Dillon plays the part of Johnny and Kyle MacLachlan plays the part of Doctor Karlock.
It was a very different story to any other that i had seen depicted in a movie of TV show before. The one i know and many too will agree, is a strong mobster leader that everyone respected and adhered to his rules. To see Tom Hardy play this part of Al Capone's life was an eyeopener. I do not think that many other actors would have been able to give the amazing performance that Tom did. He seems to have a knack of finding just the smallest little things within a role and transforms, almost morphs into that person. We have seen this from him on many of occasions as he has been Bane, Bronson, Mad Max, Venom and Alfie Solomans There are some darkly humourous parts in this movie as well as the sadness and a small amount of insight to how people who suffer from this illness must feel. I really did like the movie and found it very enlightening, i have seen that the ratings aren't very high, well it won't be to everyone's taste, give it a watch and make up your own mind.",Capone

147,trav123,Nice try but no cigar - only a carrot. Poor script with holes. Great Acting/Directing,5,26 May 2020,"First of all I want to say that I am a big fan of Trank's prior movies and loved Chronicle and Fantastic Four and was really looking forward to this artsy Film. Regardless of this review I look forward to his next film and it was a worthy venture. The film will surely be a film classic in the artsy part of the world and film school /critics but as far as entertainment for the masses it is not a big box office allure. Nice to see it on VOD.The film had lots of potential especially with such a superb actor like Hardy but unfortunately the script has too many holes to bring any type of cohesiveness except to take the viewer down a rabbit hole of bizarre dementia that gets old after the first act. At one point you think perhaps the writer is going to make the film only about how crazy Fonzo dementia is from his point of view and keep you there for the entire film but instead he jumps all over the place with diff characters that are not explained at all so you are at a loss of understanding and eventually it just meanders into meaningless to the point that even the supporting actors are at a loss looking for him and you find out some of it is real and some of it is illusion of his dementia.That pretty much is the basic perspective of the entire film and if you like that type of chaos without any structure then this is a film for you. And some might want to try to put some psychological stretch of the imagination into this element but it just does not work and deliver more depth to Fonzo's character to make one feel a connection to his madness.Regardless it was entertaining and well directed with some great shots and the acting by Hardy is superb even with his Donald Duck mumbling and hilarious carrot dangling from his mouth. It almost makes you wonder if it was better as a satire as some moments are just way out there. It must have taken a lot of energy to edit this movie and since Trank was also the editor there is no debate about him leaving anything on the cutting floor unless the producers made him cut vital parts. This is one of those films that you either love it or hate it so the low ratings is no surprise as it is definitely not a pop star mafia entertainment movie.Kudos to the director for taking a huge chance of making this unique film even if it did not come together perfectly it is a valiant effort and surely his next film will be more successful financially at the box office , which is not always a fair portrayal of a movies' success.I give it a solid 5 as the acting was superb and the directing was solid but the script was so uneven that it does not merit a higher score.",Capone

153,Osibob,Trank bombs again!!!,4,6 September 2020,"A few years back I took a gander at Mr. Hardy's upcoming pictures and was shocked at what I found; two Al Capone films in the works. One: Cicero-slated to be directed by Mr. Harry Potter himself David Yates and the other: Fonzo (original title) which was to be directed by that guy who made perhaps the most boring superhero movie ever, Josh Trank. After seeing this, I figured either it was going to be a two-part film (pre-jail/post-jail) or one would win out over the other; and the latter is what ended up happening. And to be completely honest I didn't expect a gangster classic from either directer for both work more in the fantasy genre, but I did figure the more experienced of the two would get it, I was incorrect in this assumption.
Now allow me to talk about the movie. I was warned that ""Capone"" was boring and nothing happened, but these are the same people that told me the same about ""A Most Violent Year"" and ""End of the Tour,"" both of which I loved. So what do these plebs know? Well, as it turns out...not much, but yeah, they were right about this one.

We relive some of Capone's life events through a series of situations in which he is experiencing the effects of dementia, portrayed in a raw way. After a while, we're caught in a loop of fading in and out of reality with no real end-goal for the film. It could work if the film was about brain disease without putting the spotlight on Al's story, a weak story nonetheless. As for the subplots, they are as weak as Al's reflexes.

When the trailer came out I was honestlyso taken aback because I really didn't expect a gangster movie done like this, like these movies tend to be full of action and blood, but Josh Trank was the first director to actually do it about a demented old gangster, pretty original in my opinion, so kuddos for him.Not gonna lie, I was almost more exited about seeing Jack Lowden than about the plot, but that soon changed when I saw Tom Hardy playing an old demented Al Capone, like.....The change of voice, the way he portrayed this version of Al Capone....man, how the hell didn't Tom won an Oscar last year for this,,,,or a BAFTA at least???

157,matatosky,Hardy is the reason,7,4 May 2021,"To watch this movie.Simple as that.When it was announced in 2019, I expected great things from it. Some pictures of Tom Hardy in full makeup were released and it was just so eerie and haunting to look at them. I think that was what made my decision easy to wait eagerly for this movie to come out.Coming into it, I knew it was about the last years of Capone, so I didn't really expect much action from it.The fact is, that Tom Hardy is star. The guy is surreal and his talent will NOT br denied. Everything he does is a sincere effort and he commands the screen with his unique style. Obviously redundant to say that the guy is one of my favorite modern day actors. Top 3, period.The movie had other ideas, it seems.While it shows us a solemn look at the shell of the world's most feared mob boss, it also fails us in keeping us interested in it.I'm not gonna say the movie is boring. I've seen worse and the pacing wasn't bad at all.It just didn't pack the emotional we needed.I think that if you're not a fan of Hardy, you'd hate this film and it would be understandable.It contains sequences that are downright painful to watch and although Tom Hardy's acting is so incredible and his transformation so mesmerizing, he excels in depicting the horrible reality that would've been living with a person suffering from such an awful illness and it is enough to make you uncomfortable while watching.The movie lacks an actual direction because while it is well known that Al Capone became almost unrecognizably delirious, we can't really tell what it wants to say exactly.It just takes us on a woozy and dismally lit journey through the mobster's mental state.I don't think there is an actual plot in the movie.It just meanders through the amazing acting of Tom Hardy and revolves onto a disembodied sense of reckoning that by the time the movie is done, it almost makes you feel sorry for the guy that had to go through it.I had to remind myself that this was the likeness of Al Capone we were watching and that nothing about the guy should be lauded.I got it on dvd for 5 bucks at Walmart, just a few months after it released. That alone should've let me know what to expect and it did.There's no actual reason to watch it and no takeaway from it.I gave it a 7 purely on the basis of Tom Hardy's performance.

159,pmgeorgini-255-674247,Hardy is great but the voice of Capone as he depicted it sounded like the Penguin from Batman!,3,27 August 2020,"Suffice it to say, the cast ensemble of Capone (2020) was outstanding! Bravo to all concerned. I absolutely love Tom Hardy. He's one of my favorite actors; however, I tried to see his point of view of this character but if anything, I was revolted by his adaptation of Capone. And as chameleons go, Hardy is great and can transform his body like nobody's business, but to me, the master of chameleon actors is DeNiro. Speaking of DeNiro, he is half Italian and half Irish or at least that's what I read. Al Pacino's parents migrated to America from Italy. I'm not saying that all non-Italian-Americans cannot play Italians but in this instance, I think an Italian-American actor would have been better suited for this role instead of Hardy. Just my opinion. Hardy was magnificent as Reggie and Ronnie Kray in Legend, but as Capone, he was okay not great. He was brave enough to try this and he exuded all the insecurities of this infamous gangster in his older years very well. Hardy did depict Capone as a tormented, demented, sick man--full of demons, and if that's what he was going for, he succeeded. For that I give Hardy 10 stars, But the voice was annoying and comical even and a turn-off for me!Also, non Italian-American actors such as James Caan did an excellent job playing Sonny, and Brando was great as the Godfather but as great as Hardy is his adaptation of Capone, in his later years, was almost comical, reminded me of a Dick Tracy character from the comics, or as I mentioned above, even sounded like the Penguin from Batman. But I found Hardy's take on this character frightening and disturbing. I found the storyline depressing and horrifying if truth be told. The terrible things this man had done was pure evil. I don't care how brilliant of a business man Capone was but he was pure evil. His wife was a saint. I thought at times I was watching a horror movie and if that's how Hardy depicted it, then he gets another 10 stars from me but all in all I can only give a rating of 3 stars.Al Capone's accent was Brooklynese. He was also encouraged to learn proper English which he tried throughout the years but was unsuccessful and still maintained that accent. Even so, I heard one clipping of his voice and with all due respect to Tom Hardy, he made him sound like the Penguin in Bat Man.

At first glance the plot would seem boring, as very little is actually happening. However it's sometimes challenging to identify which scenes are hallucinated, which fits well with the subjective experience of dementia. Overall the acting and production quality are top notch. It's a real movie in the sense that it was intended to have a greater effect than simply removing money from the viewer's pocket.

165,gtessarini,Inside of a ill mobster mind,5,27 May 2020,"Alphonse (Al) Capone, one of the most notorious gangsters of all time, now, portrayed after his long and violent life of crimes. Already played by several iconic figures in cinema, one of them ""The Godfather"" Robert De Niro, the character of the Italian-American mobster is now represented by the versatile British actor, Tom Hardy.The protagonist, today, is 6 years younger than the role he plays, a fact that could never be perceived by watching the film that presents the decadent and almost true ending of the mobster.The work focuses on the last year of Al Capone's life and his internal struggles to endure and continue each day that remains of his life, not for a police hunt or for a growing wave of crimes, escapes and betrayals, but for regrets and the weakened mental situation of a man released after a decade of imprisonment.The film can be described as a deepening of the confusion present in the mobster's mind without seeking to redeem him in any way, but only showing what was in his last year of life, a sick man.The semi-biographical work is based on the mixture of scenes from reality with the daydreams and illusions created by the fragile and broken mind of the gangster, affected by neurosyphilis during his incarcerated period. Rare are the times when it is clear whether what is happening is in the world or just in Capone's mind.Subtle and constant transitions of settings replace dialogues that, when uttered, sound like screams, grunts and animalistic noises coming from the criminal with Americanized Italian lines. In the case of a sick and historically violent man, this fact does not take merit from Hardy's interpretation or even from the work itself, but it does not increase his qualification either.Wallowing in Capone's blood and physiological needs, as the film portrays so often, it becomes difficult to really connect with the current situation of man without first introducing himself to what he was before.Everyone knows about the mobster Al Capone, but in filmmaking, apart from one or another daydream, there is no initial setting to really get to know him before what the work aims, even in fiction, or to see and feel compassion for the person who turned at the end.Several situations in the narrative are purely Hollywood's creation, as in the case of Capone's lost son, as far as is known today. However, by portraying the inside of the gangster's sick mind, it's not impossible to relate the subplots of the script and the search for reconciliation with his heir with the pure delusions experienced and imagined by his protagonist, clearly sorry for himself (or simply forgotten about who he really was).However, even in what can be found true, there is a tension and an exaggeration in the picture to allow us to believe that this situation occurred in reality or even in the gangster's problematic dreams, perhaps one of the most striking defects in production.The film simply portrays the inside of the mind of a sick former criminal. There are no plot twists or growth involving the protagonist or the other characters.
All the events are the result of Capone's mental confusion in his last stage of life as an invalid gangster and a disturbed man. Such an approach cannot be considered erroneous as it is precisely what the film and the director seek to focus on.If the film had the intention of imagining the last moments of Capone's disoriented persona, the work achieved such merit, but it did not surpass the exaggeration that most likely would not occur even with the most famous gangster of all time.Tom Hardy gets an animalistic, but very good interpretation of an interesting character, but hardly believable in a film that even manages to be interesting, but it is just that.",Capone

His extraordinary talent is painfully underrated. He should have had 5 oscars by now, if not more! But, naaah let us give it to Brad Pitt for just saying a couple of words and standing and looking pretty. Now, about Capone, the cry-babies who gave this extremely low rating thought it is the common mafia movie with lots of shooting and killing. How many times have we seen that in movies about Capone?! Wasn't it enough?! This movie focuses on the last stage of Capone's life: his demise, which is something we have not seen before. And Tom Hardy..... I can't help but go back to talk about his brilliance. Let me finish by saying this movie should be used in acting schools and and even shown to Oscar winning actor to tell them: This is acting!",Capone
174,gpsychos2-239-278464,I really WANTED to like this film. Like its subject matter it too suffers dementia,3,14 May 2020,"I knew going into the viewing of this that the general reviews were poor. I told myself people just DONT like seeing powerful and publicly romanticized true life figures from Americas nostalgic past portrayed at their lowest and therefore weakest point in life. We watch movies set in long ago eras to fantasize about a time when things were better and these figures were larger than life. No one wants to be told people lived the same miserable mostly boring lives reminiscing of past glory days before finally succumbing to some ailment of old age while wearing a fully loaded diaper. I knew this was a ""How the Mighty have Fallen"" portrayal of his last year of life going in. What I wasnt prepared for was the truly lackluster completely incohesive pace of the film. Its filled with scenes that you could put in ANY order to get the same movie. I knew his last year he had deep set dementia and expected the story to be mainly told through the eyes of mentally sound observers instead of through his dementia ones That sums up the experience of this movie. The movie feels like it suffers from dementia and cant hold a cohesive sense of whats going on from scene to scene. The scenes start nowhere go nowhere and ultimately end nowhere. I gave it 3 stars because of the cinematography and supporting roles portrayals. Everything else is best left forgotten",Capone

Anyone who says ""I turned it off after 20 minutes"", your review doesn't count.It's a fairly slow moving drama, it's not a movie I would ever watch again because there's no need. So it's just simply a good movie with little replay value.",Capone
177,marksarko1,The WORST ever,3,16 September 2020,"I can with no hesitation describe this Film as worse than the real Capone himself.One of the most important functions of any film is to present the characters that the viewer must cling to. On the contrary, this film started from the end of the events and ended with the end of the events and did not reach any climax or ""butter"".The movie was promoted that it would contain the life of the notorious Los Angles crime legend Capon, (Scare face) but the film did not actually address any detail of the life of this interesting character. Rather that, the author, himself the bad director, Josh Tran assumed that the character is well known, so he thinks The life of Capone is included in the school education in the elementary grades. This movie offends the notorious Al Capone himself, which is an insult to all the staff, especially the history of the great Tom Hardy. I do not know why Tom Hardy accepted this role, this can be considered as an embarrassing point in his history. that it was indispensable although his performance was wonderful in every detail so that his voice was close to the real Capone.The performance of the actors was very good, but they were not successful with the crew as a whole. The scenario is very superficial and did not contain even 1% of the value of the story.Photography is nothing more than ""normal"" or academic and not creative.
Actually everything around this movie is bad except for the acting and the decoration.In the end, Tom Hardy was, unfortunately, a marketing element only, and this threatens his career, as happened with many actors such as Nicolas Cage, Bruce Willis and other great ones, so choosing the role is a more important responsibility than performing it.The only constant is history, not the wages or promises. An actor's mistake is borne by an actor, but a director's mistake is borne by a complete movie.",Capone

Maybe it's the direction. There is no pace to the movie so it feels like a stitched together collection of scenes rather than a story. That's 1hr 43 mins I will never get back.",Capone
180,artanis_mark,Why Was This Film Made?,3,16 May 2020,"I don't see the point of this film other than as a cautionary tale on the miseries of syphilis, a message put across more effectively by those public safety shorts made back in the 30's and into the 60's.A reflection on the last year of America's most notorious hoodlum, this film generated zero dramatic tension for me. Capone is shown at his Florida mansion as he becomes increasingly more deranged and dysfunctional as the spirochetes eat away his mind while friends and family watch on in helpless despair.The film made considerable efforts to develop an effective mise-en-scene with antique cars, authentic costumes (men in period suits, women in print dresses), and Florida location shots. The effect was somewhat spoiled though by two glaring anachronisms, which probably won't bother anyone else at all: 1. Nessun Dorma plays regularly in the background, only sung by Pavarotti who at the time the film was set was still in knee pants; and 2. Capone hallucinates back to a party in his honor at the roaring '20's height, only racially integrated with black and Asian guests, something that just didn't happen in that highly prejudiced era, especially among lowlife gangsters.Throughout the film, Capone battles various enemies, real and imagined. Under constant government surveillance, figures from Capone's past emerge as well, with much interplay between what's supposed to be actually happening and the ghosts in Capone's mind. What passes for a plot turns on the $10 million Capone may have stashed somewhere. Even this McGuffin didn't stir any interest as far as I was concerned. Although a film about a gangster, Capone largely lacks the elements of a crime film that fans of the genre enjoy. Since it's a film solely about a man's degenerative end, no stakes seem to be involved; there's no real story arc about the rise and fall of a vicious gangster as in Scarface (both the original and the Pacino remake). We're just asked instead to contemplate the pitiful, sordid physical and mental decay of a truly rotten human being.This is despite a strong cast of talented actors (e.g., Matt Dillon, Kyle McLachlan) with an over the top performance by the lead. Tom Hardy proves once again he will literally do anything the role requires. Face covered in putty to depict deep scars and syphilitic sores, he staggers around the house and grounds growling in a deep baritone, throwing fits, fouling the bed while asleep with his wife, and ultimately reduced to wearing adult diapers with carrots substituted for the cigars Capone chain smoked.The problem is that, despite the makeup and method acting, Hardy really doesn't resemble Capone who had a very round, moon face. This has happened before. One particularly egregious example was casting the very Irish looking Jason Robards as Capone in The St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Capone left me with such a bad taste I immediately watched Al Capone afterward, the well done, realistic '59 flick in which Rod Steiger (who facially did resemble Capone) masterfully portrayed the criminal in all his boorish flamboyance.I recommend this film to no one.",Capone

183,ophidiancartomancy,A 2+ hour visit to the memory care unit,1,19 June 2020,"This is, and no exaggeration here, THE worst movie I've seen all year. All actors have that 'one film' that they wish would magically disappear from all history. This is Hardy's.He plays Capone in the last year or so of his life, the portrayal of which includes slack-jawed catatonia the majority of the time. This isnt really about 'Capone'... and could be about any older man suffering with dementia.The question I had throughout this film? Why bother? It adds nothing to the legacy of Capone (which is still significant 100 years later.) It added nothing to the evening I spent watching this travesty either. Damn shame that so many people will walk away thinking ""I should have checked IMDB first!""",Capone
184,twilightshadows-428-400303,Not a gangster movie,9,13 May 2020,"The low reviews probably reflect expectations that were not fulfilled. I'll admit I scored it a bit higher than I normally might have to counter some of those low ratings that I think are unfair and based solely on it not being the kind of movie the reviewer was expecting. If you are looking for something like Scarface or Goodfellas, you will be disappointed. This is a drama, not an action film, though there are a few action scenes, which are rather gruesome. It is about a man suffering from dementia, who just happens to be Al Capone. We get a look inside his head, and there are times when you don't know what's real and what isn't. It's realistic and, I think, relatively accurate. Unfortunately, because it's about Capone, it may not reach the audience who would appreciate it. Again, this is a slow moving, cerebral film. The film could have been better had we had more of those action scenes in flashback. I would also have liked more background on some of the characters and their relationship to Capone. However, as it stands, it's a good movie and worth seeing if you like this type of movie. The entire movie is almost completely from Capone's perspective, and perhaps the writer tried to stay a bit too accurate and too much inside Capone's head. There are things that are never fully explained. It's also possible some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. That being said, it is an interesting peek into the mind of Capone in his last days. The film is beautifully shot with some wonderful scenes following Capone down dark hallways as well as some really nice outdoor shots. The acting is superb all around. There are characters who have few to no lines, yet still manage to be noticeable. Standouts are, of course, Tom Hardy as Capone, incredibly believable as both Capone and as a man suffering dementia. He manages to capture the sheer presence of a man who was, arguably, a king in his world, and in some ways still is, while at the same being vulnerable as confusion and paranoia overtake him. Despite his reputation as a mafia kingpin and a stone cold killer, this Capone elicits sympathy and compassion and appears to show great regret as well as possibly suggesting he was not, at least, directly responsible for some of the stories attributed to him. Other standouts are Linda Cardellini as his wife May, Noel Fisher as his legitimate son, and Matt Dillon as his old friend (pay attention; things are not what they seem at first). Like Hardy's, Cardellini'a and Fisher's performances are spot on, very realistic as his concerned, devoted family. I Just wish they, particularly Noel Fisher, had been given more to do. Linda Cardellini is excellent, however, the perfect mix of loving wife and no-nonsense, takes no crap, Italian woman married to a mob boss. Noel Fisher is perfect as the devoted son, but there is little of the Mickey Milkovitch tough guy on display here. Though he is Capone's son, there is no hint he has been groomed for the business. What we see are compassion and concern. He is not overly emotional or wimpy by any means, but if you're looking for Mickey, this is the Mickey that takes care of Ian Gallagher when he's sick, not the Mickey of the streets. Still, as always, his scenes were some of my favorites, and I wish there had been more. Matt Dillon, too, needed more scenes, but those he is in are key to the story being told. He too, is perfect in the role, believable and charismatic without trying too hard. All of these actors can be praised for their subtle, realistic performances. There is no overacting, no melodrama, just good solid performances. It doesn't feel like we are watching a film. It feels like more of a voyeuristic view of the inside of Capone's head and a family's private moments as they are occurring.",Capone

Tom Hardy doesn't need to act in this movie. All Hardy does is look pale and mumble. I thought the movie would show some flashbacks and have Capone so some remorse for the violence he had done, this movie does none of that. Matt Dillon is hardly in this movie but it must have been worth the money for him I guess. There is nothing even remotely accurate in this movie. When Capone retired to Florida he was basically mentally incompetent. How would anyone in this mental state ever get a hold of a machine gun let alone a gold plated one. Capone was 48 when he died. He was hardly the gray haired 60 year old looking character in this movie. This movie has no direction other than to show dementia is bad.

F Murray Abraham as Capone in Dillinger And Capone in 1990. Ray Sharkey in The Revenge Of Al Capone in 1991 Stephen Graham as Capone in Boardwalk Empire 2015 and now finally Tom Hardy in Capone... Every actor that has played Al Capone in the past have given the role their all. I own Every Al Capone movie and I can safely say that this movie is the best of them all and I will explain why... It's the first Capone movie to show Capone as a real human being instead of the power house he once was. This flick has much depth it almost brings a tear to the eye. We feel sorry for big Al in this movie and have mercy on his soul atleast that's how it made me feel. Tom Hardy is without a doubt the best Al Capone to grace the screen he is amazing. This is like watching the real Al Capone in real life it's that good. Rod Steiger was surely the Best Capone to date but this movie is on another level. We see Capone suffer and we want to rescue him from his pain. This movie really touched me deep it has many powerful scenes that are simply genius I can't wait to watch this for the 2nd time as I had the wrong expectations on the first viewing... There is no dvd release for this movie as it's on Netflix and blue ray but I managed to get hold of an original import copy on ebay before its Blue Ray release on 20th July. This movie is for the real mob movie fan like me one must know his Capone movies before watching this that's for sure. I give this movie a champion 10/10 it's a very important movie with a personal feeling of knowing big Al. Tom Hardy deserves an Oscar. As far as I'm concerned there are no weak spots in this film it's exactly how it should be of been made regarding direction,pace and soundtrack.

When I saw the trailer, I thought, 'What an interesting take/angle on this famours gangster!' - Losing your power through old age and your mental faculties - GREAT idea!
Unfortunately this couldn't be further from the truth. The trailer gave me the impression he was still 'making moves'. Alas, this is literally nothing but watching his deterioration. There is only ONE 'rising action' element of plot but throughout the movie, I really couldn't care less which way that that 'rising action' climaxed!.... Which means something has gone terribly wrong!
I got bored around 40 mins in and at 60 mins it was actually starting to become painful/torturous and I almost stopped watching... Considering the woeful climax, I wish I HAD stopped at about 60 mins in!
The ONLY way this movie might be interesting to you, is if you have never seen any movie where someone declines/degrades over time/loses their mind and even then, there are far more interesting movies where that happens...

213,billsuon,Trank still doesn't know how to tell a story,3,22 May 2020,"This movie can be summed up in one question: where the f... is the story?
The movie's about Al Capone's last days, allright, but that's the SUBJECT, not the STORY.
In order to have a story, you need a protagonist, a goal, and an obstacle for the protagonist to overcome in order to reach the goal. This movie only has the protagonist. With no goal and no obstacle, there's no conflict and therefore no drama. So you're basically better off watching a documentary about Capone than this so-called movie.
Also, Matt Dillon's character doesn't make any sense. I'm not going to say more on that because I want to keep this review spoiler free.
I'm giving 3 stars for Tom Hardy's performance who, far from being Oscar worthy (he's clearly overacting), is always enjoyable in those kinds of extreme roles. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say that if you never see this movie, you won't miss much.
Josh Trank said that since Max Landis wrote Chronicle, Capone is really the first movie that can be considered as a Josh Trank movie. That's not something he should be proud of. He still has a lot to learn about storytelling.",Capone
214,kriskennedy-79484,Major disappointment...hardly worth the $5.99 rental cost,4,13 May 2020,"This film had so much potential to tell Capone's life story against the backdrop of his final years sinking into the oblivion that dementia and syphilis did to him. Instead, we get a film that more or less showcases a mumbling, catatonic Tom Hardy sitting around staring into the abyss chomping on cigars and carrots while the supporting cast does very little to keep the story going.
What was missing here was something similar to the first two Godfather films that showed flashbacks of an earlier time and how the characters came to be as they were in the present, and with Capone's history there was much material to work with to make this movie work if they had tried the same. Clocking in at just over 90 minutes there was never enough time in this movie to do anything on that scale or perhaps the budget but it's a wasted effort given this is Hardys second attempt to play Capone which makes we wonder how he could accept this script given the lack of depth. Robert DeNiros portrayal in The Untouchables from 1987 is still the gold standard after more than thirty years",Capone
215,Narniatonto,A Rise-and-Fall Story Without the Rise,3,8 September 2020,"Capone stars Tom Hardy in a biopic about Al Capone, the notorious gangster who amassed a staggering fortune in racketeering during Prohibition. That cemented him as a formidable crime boss, a reputation that reverberates even today.But in the latter half of his life, Al Capone -- once synonymous with power -- is reduced to a shell of his former self. After serving a decade in prison for tax evasion, the once larger-than-life gangster becomes afflicted with dementia and neurosyphilis, and is plagued by the ghosts of his past.The premise alone is brilliant. Writer-director Josh Trank should be commended for assuming the daring responsibility of assigning a certain humanity to an individual looked up on as a god. This is a rise-and-fall story -- the likes of which most filmmakers would be afraid to tackle.The main issue, however, is the absence of Capone's rise. The movie works on the assumption that the audience has a preexisting knowledge of Al Capone. In this way the character has no arc, and worse, none of the beats feel earned, and the impact is lost. Imagine if the last half hour of Martin Scorsese's recent epic The Irishman was isolated and prolonged to feature length. The result would feel manipulative and disingenuous.Everything that the viewer does learn about the ill-fated legend is explicitly told to the audience, either in the opening and closing titles, or through exhaustingly-expository dialogue. The dementia-ridden former-criminal is haunted by hallucinations of the people in his life that he has wronged. These apparitions include Johnny Torrio (played by Matt Dillon) and a boy carrying a gaudy balloon. It's not until well into the second act that we learn who Dillon is meant to be playing, and the reveal is wholly auditory as Johnny explains to Capone (or rather the audience) how he had skimmed a little off the top and in turn met a grisly fate at the hands of the Tom Hardy character.Of course, we never see this scene play out, nor is the relationship between the two characters even remotely fleshed out. The boy, who the viewer can guess early on is Capone's son Tony, wanders in and out of the hallucinations holding his golden balloon. The audience is never questioning the sanity of the protagonist; the dream sequences are in no way grounded and are without fail interrupted with Hardy gutturally moaning as he squirms around on the floor, leaving no room for interpretation.The notion of Capone wandering through different memories as his mind deteriorates theoretically could work, but who the characters are is cloudy and the cinematography sticks to stationary medium shots devoid of personality -- a far cry from the Lynch films director of photography Peter Deming has worked on in the past. The aesthetic mirrors John Travolta's reviled works The Fanatic and Gotti. The character is treated with as much nuance as a tommy gun to the face. Tom Hardy gets lost in the character, but his unintelligible speech and grotesque actions (he defecates in not one, but two scenes) create a performance that is nothing short of laughable. There is an overabundance of Oscar-baity films each year, but Trank's latest bizarrely seems to be catered to the Razzies.",Capone

218,Ham9000,A disappointing retelling of an intriguing historical figure,4,12 May 2020,"It's a shame that I have to see talented actors, and a promising premise, be wasted in a messy, badly edited, over the top film. It doesn't make sense that 'Capone' is an experimental, psychological thriller when it should be a mafia movie.To start with the pros, the supporting performances were pretty good (especially from Linda Cardellini), and I thought the cinematography was pretty impressive. The film shows that Trank has improved as a director, and I commend him for that. Despite all the positive elements, I thought the film was frustrating to watch. I don't understand the praise for Tom Hardy from critics and audiences, because I thought his performance was sooooooooooo over the top, but not even in a good way. Don't get me wrong, I think Hardy is a phenomenal actor and can give Oscar-worthy performances in god awful movies (like Venom.)
But his portrayal of Al Capone fails to be captivating and tends to be obnoxious and cringe-worthy at times. It's either his fault or Josh Trank's, I don't know.
The editing is some of the worst editing I've seen since Bohemian Rhapsody (which is far worse than this), there's so many cuts in one scene, and I wonder why they couldn't just capture it in one take. The score felt too electronic, which took me out of the 1930s era (or 40s, I don't know.)If Trank ever plans on doing another biopic, I suggest he didn't do that, and that he should stick to experimental sci-fi thrillers in the future. I really wanted to like this film, but it just didn't work out the way I wanted it to.4/10, What a shame.",Capone

231,megamatt-80194,I'm pretty disappointed.,3,12 May 2020,"I was excited for this film. Upon hearing the early reviews, I just assumed the critics didn't get it. Nope. They're right. I spent $10 on this film, and I regret almost every penny.Here's why:Tom Hardy gives a riveting performance as Al Capone. He's a Frankenstein-esque presence throughout the entire film. He stumbles around paranoid, grumbling in a raspy voice and shouting expletives. And while this sounds like severe overacting, he does it in a way which seems utterly real and mesmerizing. He's the center of attention every moment onscreen, and he deserves all the praise. He's pretty much the only great thing in a bad and mostly unimportant film.Why is it so bad? Well, Josh Trank directed, wrote, and edited this film. While the direction and editing are serviceable at best, with them being nothing to shout home about, it's his script which is extremely poor.To put it simply: ""Capone"" has absolutely nothing to say, and no reason to exist.The script, once you meticulously rip out the unneeded ambiguity, is simplistic and infantile. It's merely a stripped down imagination of Capone's last year alive, and it's filled with only commonly known vague historic plot points to stretch out it's runtime. It doesn't explore these historic events besides recreating them on film. It adds no substance, and no depth. It's essentially like viewing a history book. Here's this scene, here's this scene, here's this scene, and the film ends.From the trailers, I expected a character deep-dive into the mind of a mob boss plagued by dementia. But even the feverishly mad hallucination sequences serve no purpose, and offer no depth. It's like they're there to show off gore, lavish parties, and introduce a character that they never do anything with besides having him reference a pointless plot point that never goes anywhere as well. This film has nothing to say, and never makes an attempt to say something. It's basically just being a voyeur. We see moments in Capone's life in an unstructured and ambiguous manner, and then the film ends.It does nothing with the one thing it presents, which is Capone's childhood, and what it does show makes no sense because it never takes the time to explain anything. Showing, and not telling is a very important part of storytelling. But when you have a simplistic plot with no depth, and you simply throw in meaningless ideas, references, and situations in an ambiguous manner, that doesn't make a script deep. In fact, it makes it even more empty.It's like Trank wanted to do one scene in this film, and simply threw in stuff from Capone's life to try and make it a feature length film. It offers no new insights, or any interesting development to Capone as a man, or as a gangster. It's honestly utterly meaningless in almost every sense of the word. You can try and tell me that it's about a mob boss losing his power, but right at the start of the film, it's clear Capone can't do anything anymore besides grunt, speak in growling sentences, and move like a zombie. And by the end of the film, he's no different. Capone doesn't change into anything worthwhile, (besides an increasingly sicker old man), and neither does anyone around him.I'm giving it a 3 purely because of Hardy. But if any future filmmakers are out there reading this, take this into consideration: If you have an idea, and you want to explore it subtly, go explore it! But make sure you show, as well as tell in the right moments. We've seen many times how insufferable a film is when it purely tells, and now, we have an example of when a film only shows, but doesn't tell. When making a film, don't balance your entire plot on ambiguity. Ambiguity is good in snippets, but when the story relies on it, it cannot bolster a full film. It will fail, because you as the filmmaker are not making a statement, or saying anything worthwhile. Instead, you're saying nothing by showing the audience nothing that can be tethered to anything important, since everything can be classified as being non-existent.Confusing? Yeah, that's how the film feels.This is not a mob-movie. Nor is it really a movie. It's a collection of moments made to seem like there's a coherent, structured, worthwhile story. Believe me, no matter how appealing it may be, there is no story. There is nothing except the exceptional performance by Tom Hardy. Don't be like me, and spend ten bucks on this film. I got majorly Ca-pwned by this picture.",Capone

The whole movie, like the old al Capone, is full of a weak Twilight feeling, trapped in the devastation and self pity.

There hardly feels as if there is any story worth paying attention to (and I'm someone who knows a lot about Al Capone, if you don't, I can imagine this film is somehow even worse). Insofar as Hardy's performance... I'm not sure what people are praising. Aside from looking nothing like Capone and looking more like some kind of creepy Halloween costume (whose costume I have no idea, but some type of a creepy character who may or may not be human), the performance is really cheesy and over-the-top. It does not even resemble Al Capone on any level.

All of them have in common their historical mark in the work of each director, but none, perhaps, has as much freshness as Al Capone, this is undoubtedly one of the great names that associate real life with art within this genre, portrayed in several films , assuming his own name or an inspired pseudonym, Capone always comes up with the mysticism of the real character who dominated the Chicago mafia for a period. When launching ""Capone (2020)"", Josh Trank presents the human side of the character, even if in an imminent state of decomposition.It seems that mafia films have really moved their classics, actors, characters and directors to the end. If in ""The Irishman"" the old guard barely changes shots, here this style of overcoat with guns and a hat is even more distant, not surprisingly the film was promoted as the last year of the gangster's life. It is very common in these works for technical constructions to work accurately, without wasting a lot of time in this regard, it is worth ratifying that all period construction works perfectly, costumes, architecture, environment, classic cars that impose all purchasing power, everything works. What is worth thinking about is the style and choice of the film, deconstructing what is so common to the genre is a risk that requires a good background to be taken, after all, mafia film is directly linked to action, plot and power. This risk is assumed when in the first scene the director already shows that human decay is possible for everyone, Capone here is imposing for what it was and not for what it is.The eye-catching look due to the protagonist's imminent bankruptcy is the gateway to the moment of the film, right from the start the physical incapacity of the character, who suffers from neurosyphilis, is clarified and it is from this that the director signals his direction to the visual aspect . All makeup produced has the objective of shocking the public at first sight and it will certainly work, Fonz (nickname of Al Capone) is horrifying, decadent, depressing and in this footprint the director narrates the journey of the decline of a human life, dictated by a disease that has the cruel equivalence of the criminal's life, withering physically and mentally its carrier. In favor of this, the director plays with everything that is available within the cinematographic language, using metalanguage in order to justify that the suffering is deserved, as it is in Fonz's daydreams that the parallel is made between different moments and different actions, making the protagonist himself question the need for actions; note: it is metalanguage at the service of the cinematographic style and it is the cinematographic style at the service of human reflection, it is this reflexive conflict that takes the film out of its first layer and the text uses this aspect well when using these same daydreams to tell part of the story character and go down a step in his condition, thus bringing the necessary verisimilitude in this regard.I confess that the most shocking point in the film is the trajectory, attaching to the visual is very shallow, but it is also valid, however, to agree that a good part of the public will be bothered by the wounds, the drool or a defecate here and another one there, but it is the journey that counts and it is also in the journey that the ""train"" loses stability. The presentation of an important character for the plot is totally out of focus, it is free and serves only to remember that such an aspect also exists in that marginal universe, it would not be missed if it did not exist as it does not take long to ""kill the charade"" . In the middle the film tries to fit a mood where it doesn't fit, in the middle the film tries to create a suspense that doesn't exist, nobody wants to know if the character has a buried fortune; neither the viewer nor the characters there. Fonze will not remember, he is insane and if he remembered, Josh Trank would remember his days of ""Fantastic Four"" and I would definitely ask for a chargeback. The conclusion also leaves an empty and interpretive air, valid! but the feeling is that it was not the original cut of the film, it seems that someone stopped the director, every siege was set up for the final point, including drawing that point. Do you know when you attend an athletics event and when the shot is taken to signal the start of the race? It is there that the tension rises, it is as if at that moment of shooting the TV would turn off and you would not see the race, there is an end that does not need to be shown, but there is an end that needs to be seen, it is part of the plot.The cast is fully functional and is directed towards the protagonist, including Louis Armostrong, who appears in an excellent montage. The highlight is Linda Cardellini who plays the boss's wife, the actress goes through all the tension that probably exists when living with someone in those conditions, the worry continues, the dread, the physiological disgust, the need to help, the wear and tear that all that provokes, Mae is the character that puts the viewer in the situation. After watching the film, it is impossible to imagine another person to give life to the gangster, Tom Hardy has this changeable characteristic in his works, forget ""Venom"" please, a quick search in the actor's filmography and you will notice this physical and mental delivery. It's no different here, it's not just the makeup that translates this, it's the curved and crooked walk, it's the bloody and withering look, but still threatening, it's the hoarse voice of someone who swallowed many cigars, it's the surprise and disappointment of those who go realizing that you no longer have control over your physiological needs. It is dirty, visceral work that sometimes joins the gore and the feeling of decay when flies and humming circulate the character. It may not be easy for some, but for the cinema, in times of pandemic, it brings a freshness in terms of acting. Using an old French theater term, if I saw Tom Hardy after a performance like this I would shout .",Capone

This movie is the same as Fant4stic in the sense that every thing I would want to see in a movie of this genre was not present. I havent seen many bad Hardy performances, but he was not good, the makeup was terrible and the story was not particularly interesting. Do not waste your time on this one.
What genre can he defile next? Maybe give him a western?",Capone
264,vin-55,Seriously...,3,21 June 2020,"I don't even know how Tom Hardy accepted this role. It was such a waste knowing we could have Taboo season 2 instead of this.

The last weird movie I watched with him was Bronson many years ago, but this one is just too much. Didn't manage to watch the whole movie...",Capone
265,JHeez15,Not sure why there is so much negativity,8,17 May 2020,"If you watched the trailer, you knew going in that this film wasn't going to profile the heyday of Al Capone, but rather his cognitive decline at the end of this life. I am not sure if this is indicative of our times that people can't sit through a movie without all of the bells and whistles, but I thought this was a phenomenal portrayal of what dementia looks like. It just goes to show you that even the wealthy are just human and suffer like anyone else. I recommend this movie to everyone. It is not a gangster film but a portrayal of a violent criminal whose dementia haunts him.",Capone
266,matt-joseph-hopkins,Seriously....,5,12 May 2020,Can Tom Hardy just finish season 2 of Taboo already? This is a waste of his time and talent.,Capone
267,alvaradoman,Shady and innacurate,4,11 October 2020,Many of the things happening here are historically incorrect. It seems as though the guy that wrote the story just wanted to stain Al Capone's reputation or humiliate his offspring. It is sad a great actor that is Tom Hardy got sucked into this. He went a step backwards in his career with this role.,Capone

Something about the intricacies behind every movie yet still I didn't take the time until now. Tom Hardy made a monumental addition to the Capone legacy. Thank you, sir. As for Trank, this isn't your redemption for dropping the ball on a comic book movie, this is a genuine success and heart felt contribution to film making. Thank you, sir. Dementia in a person's final days can test how you truly remember them. It can reflect on how true ones' love can be for another and the distance they are prepaired to go. This film also gave us a small window into the mind of the afflicted and the haunting truth behind the inevitable. Bravo gentlemen.",Capone

They watched it expecting a new Mafia movie like Scarface, Godfather or Irishman but the truth is that this isn't a movie about Al Capone... There are other movies about him... This is a movie about Fonso... This movie doesn't glorify being a criminal.. it's the story of how fairytales end in Real life... He was born Alfonso... He became Al Capone... He died Fonso... An old... Miserable... Sick man...",Capone
274,jjfmaguire,Another Trank Tank,3,25 May 2020,"This is a truly terrible, pointless waste of acting talent.
The story seems to centre around Al Capone in his final year before dying, having been released from prison due to deterioration of health and living out his last year confined to a home in Florida.
Tom Hardy takes the lead and does what he can.
Linda Cardellini puts in a very good acting performance and Matt Dillon is solid along with some decent supporting cast turns.
What an opportunity - Hardy playing Al Capone. We could have had flashback scenes to the St. Valentines Day massacre, we could have had Capone going over his actions of the past - his regrets as he tries to reconcile his conscience, tormented by his past in his final days.
The writting here is shockingly bad and the direction and production are worse.
What we get is repeats of soiling the bed and peeing in chairs and for some reason an inane focus on a son out of wedlock he may or not have had and a pathetic side story incoherently embedded about some missing money the FBI seem to want to find.
This is truly terrible and it is time Trank reconsidered his career.
Tom Hardy - what on earth possessed you?",Capone
275,ohahhericcantona,Went nowhere,2,3 March 2021,I feel a bit sorry for too hardy as he played the role well the issue is the story line is terrible.

Memories of his violent life haunt him day and night, and we experience the horror with him. He's a tortured man subjected to his infected mind. Several storylines keep it suspenseful. Make-up artistry was incredible....we could watch him physically decline.",Capone

281,yhoha_2001,Tom hardy needs to work only with the likes of Scorsese/Tarantino.,5,12 May 2020,"We've seen many great performances put to screen by Hardy, beginning with Bronson, which gave him the attention he needed, and ending with this one.But with Capone, it was really only Hardy, plus Linda Cardellini's (with little screen-time) usual great work. We've seen many great acting talents wasted on poor screenplays and directing, which we hope not to see in the likes of Tom Hardy.His only Oscar nomination was while working with a great director in Alejandro Iñárritu, but that was only it. If he takes the Leonardo DiCaprio route and only work with great directors (e.g. Scorsese, Tarantino, Nolan, Spielberg and Cameron), we would most definitely see the best in him, and him getting the appreciation he deserves.We don't know what was intended with this movie, but whatever they had planned, Hardy did just enough to make it work. It may seem as an unconventional parodying performance, or just absolute madness-portraying.If you appreciate great acting, watch this movie. Otherwise, you might want to look out for better plot experiences.",Capone
282,srajmi,Ridiculous,1,15 June 2020,"With all respect to Tom Hardy he has no guilt in this but this movie is just ridiculous. A real joke of depicting Al Capone. I mean you can't portray history step by step but this is just ridiculous. Rather have made him have a deal with the devil and become successful.Based on true events? Pfah,maybe,but not this one. Rather watch a documentary on history channel about the theme. Pure Hollywood garbage. I was really expecting something good. Just watch some good old FIlm Noir from the classics.At least the director made a good movie even with noname actors.",Capone

Tom Hardy for this role was a terrible Idea, he looks nothing like Capone, he is nothing like an Italian Gangster of that time period, it just simply wasn't convincing that he was this character he was trying to portray.

I have 2 family members and I'm sure there a lot of other people who have seen what dementia can do to a person...But what does it do to a gangster with skeletons in his closet. The Director is too smart for his own good here and you literally have to break down scene by scene in order to take this movie on the ride it was intended to go on. If you are looking for a gangster movie or are close minded, you will not understand what the movie is. But this is a classic! trust me 40 years from now when we understand more of the human Brain this will be a masterpiece...

293,jcobane,A flawed look at Capone's last days.,6,13 May 2020,"An art house take on Capone's last days that has a lot going for it. Mostly it's the performances. Tom Hardy obviously chomping at the bit to do some Gary Oldman-esque fat-suit work, and to that end he mostly succeeds.I feel like Hardy was leaning in more of a Death of Stalin direction with his performance, but you get the sense that the film almost betrays him. It only wants to dip a toe or two in the waters of comedic absurdity when it should have jumped right in.I know it's useless to make suggestions after the fact but I'm drunk and this is the Internet. Maybe reallocate the time spent on the rather meaningless lost son subplot. Give it to the obsessed FBI agent. Develop him. A lot of comedic potential in the FBI's interest in a legendary criminal with the mind of a twelve year old. There's hints of that in here. Lots of hints of greatness.I should clarify I'd never have dreamt of an Al Capone comedy until I saw this movie. Those elements are in the movie's DNA already. It's hilarious at points, but I never got the sense that the film wanted to be as funny as Tom Hardy wanted it to be.Now, whether that's the film's fault, or Hardy's, who's to say. Either way, I don't regret watching it.",Capone
294,danhodge3820,Deserves better reviews,7,27 February 2021,"I think most people who watched this wanted or expected a good gangster film starring a great actor, what you get is a great interpretation of one of the most prolific gangsters in history, slowly losing his mind. You're not sure at parts whether what you're seeing is reality or in Capones mind. Most people forget how Capone went out, he was ill with syphillis and was too late to get the early types of penicillin to slow the brain damage so had the mental age of a 12 year old around the time this movie is set. Definitely a thought provoking film",Capone

I can almost commend the writer for trying something different and not making the typical gangster film but it didn't work.Tom is no Marlon Brando and I think this film may have exposed him somewhat, Linda played her role well as did Matt but the plot was dull and the film hard to follow. My brain demanded a ten minute snooze through it but there was no refreshment by the end. It reeked of arty, fartiness; one of those films dreamed up by actors and only an actor could enjoy.

It's not entertaining, insightful, thought provoking or even original. When will we learn that without a story and writing you can't have a great film. No matter how great the acting is.We need to give more credit to screenwriters, rather than actors. Without the right screenwriter providing the screenplay the cast are just like a a chessboard with all the right pieces but no player. As is true here.Trank directs this film as if the character is so interesting that the screenplay and story was an afterthought. Unfortunately that is not the case.The film has brief moments of interest almost deceiving you into thinking the film might be going somewhere, only to find out the scene was a dream.

320,darkhood1759,Disappointing,4,26 May 2020,"The title ""Capone"" suggests this is a biopic of the greatest gangster of the early 1900s instead we get the shell of the man. Phonse cannot speak 90% of the movies except in the begining when he is addressing one of the kids at the dinner table. Nothing else about him is memorable from the movie.",Capone
321,glyn-jackson,Terrible waste of talent,2,28 February 2021,The only good thing I can say about this film is that there were some very good performances by a talented cast. Tom Hardy came across as scarily good in his portrayal as Al Capone which is totaly wasted as the film itself is truly awful.What could have been quite an interesting look at the final year(s) of this legendary gangster was just a series of bizarre nightmare dream sequences that left you feeling like the last two hours had been a complete waste of time.,Capone

325,jeansanchez-80827,WORST MOB MOVIE EVER!!!!!,1,13 May 2020,"Well I hate to say it but ""Capone"" might just be the worst mob film I have ever seen, it poops the bed figuratively and literally in the film. This film was originally envision for theaters and probably as an awards vehicle for Tom Hardy , and while he'll probably get an award it won't be an Oscar but maybe a Razzie. I've always felt Hardy was great or good in pretty much everything but this is easily his worst performance ever. He mumbled his way through his entire dialogue. I had a hard time understanding what he was saying for most of the run time. I know he loves to try out accents and I usually like most but I didn't like anything about the approach he took here. As shocking as it is for me to say it I'd rather see Travolta's ""Gotti"" before I see this ever again. I definitely have to watch ""The Untouchables"" and ""The St. Valentines Day Massacre"" now to wash the stench of it off.
______________________________________
The film took a different approach, centering on Capone's last days when he's suffering from syphilis/dementia. The approach was an interesting one, but the execution just sucked.I feel bad for Josh Trank, he hit it out the ballpark with ""Chronicle"", but has followed that with two terrible films in ""Fant4stic"" and this. He is a modern day Richard Kelly ( director of ""Donnie Darko""), a one hit wonder in every sense of the word. Josh also wrote/edited the film so all the films flaws lie on him, he can't use the studio interference line like he did for ""Fant4stic"". Although credit to Josh for getting his freedom back and making the film he wanted. A lot of the film plays in Capone's head and it's hard to differentiate what's real and what isn't. In the hands of a better filmmaker , this could of been compelling story about the sad final days of one of the most ruthless men ever.",Capone
326,Earnshaw74,A mess,2,21 May 2020,"This film is basically tom hardy stumbling around on screen for 90 mins shouting incoherently. No real plotline, no dialogue. Honestly it's a total mess.

Without giving anything away the scene that introduces Matt Dillon to the story does not tie in with the outcome of Matt Dillons character. It just leaves you for hours after asking yourself why that scene was in the film? Epic fail! As if it was filmed after changing the script but they forgot to remove it.

336,rmaxwell-33661,Don't understand the hate?,10,14 May 2020,"First time ever reviewing on IMDB but felt I had to. I was expecting Capone to be the worst movie ever made going by the initial reviews and still don't get the 1 star reviews. This movie was never marketed as a standard mobster movie, so if people were expecting that then they were obviously going to be dissapointed. It was made clear that this was more akin to a horror movie full of nightmarish and surreal scenes due to the diminished brain capacity of Capone. Maybe it's just me but to me it was a narration around the decay of the human body and how in the end all the money or gold etc doesn't matter, also how theres zero dignity when your mind and body betrays you. Is it bonkers, absolutely but at least it's interesting. I certainly don't want to watch another formulaic mob movie. Is it flawed, yes. Personally I didn't mind the first and second scenes of Capone defiling himself because it served a purpose and had context. The third one with the FBI guys was unecessary though and seemed played for laughs, completely out of place imo. Its a shame the movie wasn't more cohesive as Tom Hardy was brilliant. If you like weird movies then watch but keep an open mind. Personally loved what they were trying to do anyway.",Capone

The film is a all speculation of how his life was during this time. There really is no basis of fact and seems the writers took liberty in most aspects to tell a story of a guilt ridden man with a mental deterioration. The character of Al Capone is not really Al Capone but a symbol of dementia and what it can be like. I personally would have liked more fact behind the iconic character, such as real people referenced, events, etc. His wife, his brother, and his son seem to be the only real life people this movie seems to reference. Yes it is NOT a biopic, but it could have more fact than fiction for the sake of a real mans name and life. Some good scenes; unexpected scenes that keep the movie goer watching. Overall, the movie speculates, with some factual writing errors of time and people, giving the 4 stars only to entertainment value.",Capone

It is shot beautifully, the music is atmospheric and well done and as always Tom Hardy,as well as most of the other cast, perform their roles tremendously. It's just boring.It seemed like they didn't know what plot to tell, Capone slipping further into dementia and insanity in his last year or the FBI/ Capone himself trying to figure out if there are millions of dollars hidden somewhere. They tried telling both, the former more successful than the latter, however both come up short and by the end of the movie you're left with the feeling that nothing was accomplished in the last hour and a half.I ended up renting this for $4.99 so I don't have too much buyers remorse, but if your not a huge Tom Hardy/ El-P stan, then I would definitely wait for it to go to a streaming service and check it out there.

347,TheRealWadeWilson,Should have been a DC film really,2,15 May 2020,"Hardy's portrayal of Capone was more in line with Buster Merryfield's ""Penguinj"" from the Batman TV series. The screen play writers should have just taken it to DC & changed the name Capone to Cobblepot. It could have been the next film in a series that included ""Joker"". Even my wife asked why Tom Hardy was playing the Penguin when she walked in as I was watching it.A waste of Tom Hardy's talent IMHO as he showed that he has depth in playing characters that require specific traits, although he did have a head start with Bronson.",Capone

Not a review, rather an opinion.",6,27 May 2020,"First, this is not Scarface, nor this is anything similar to what Scorsese had been doing his entire gangster-filmography. So bear that in mind before watching.Now, I've been expecting this film for a year, basically since the news of casting Hardy to portray Al Capone. Later on, there were the news saying that it will not have been your regular biopic instead it would rather focus on a specific time of Capone's life. And I was happy with that. In fact, I believe that quite often a biopic only wins if it focuses on a particular episode from one's life.Although what we've got in the end is an unorthodox yet, IMO, unsuccessful anti-gangster film attempt that either lacks another half of the film or is, in fact, longer that it should have been.Let the overall rating of 4,9 not scare you. I guess people were just frustrated since they wanted to see some Scarface-Hardy gangster action. I don't blame them. But the film doesn't deserve such low rating, it is not bad per se. The truth is, when I started to type this ""review"" I had wanted to criticize it badly for a lack of substance. Eventually, I had to rewrite it completely since I've realized that I was wrong and it does have something that can be read between the lines.So, don't be confused with the overall rating, watch it and decide yourself whether it's a failure or a movie with a decent message.P.S.

Yes, like every movie it has issues like the biggest one, the script, i think the script is the biggest issue on this movie, there are some really cursy lines and the narrative is not the best, also there are some really long and boring sequences where nothing happens, just pure silence.Now Tom Hardy is great as AlCapone, he doesn't looks like Al at all but his acting is great, i think the makeup is on pourpuse beacuse AlCapone was a monster literally and the makeup makes him look awfull like a monster and thats a really cool idea, if you analise the movie you will discover that is an autocritic to Trank's life and experiences, also idk why everyone hated the fact that makes you feel strange and confused beacuse that means that the direction is great and actually makes you feel the way the director wants you to feel after watching this movie.In conclution, this movie is great and i will love to see more Josh Trank's future projects.

392,dannysallurday,Not what you expect but worth watching without those expectations,8,13 May 2020,"I think expectations will take away from this movie, especially the trailer. It is a slow-burning look into the psyche of a man reconciling his past with the legacy he'll leave behind, and it's certainly not pretty. Writing with an artistic flourish and beautiful cinematography shine the spotlight on an incredible performance by Tom Hardy, start to finish. Though I would've loved to see him as a prime Capone, I enjoyed what I got instead: an uncomfortable, confusing, suffocating look into the deterioration of the world's most notorious gangster.",Capone

The beginning description speaks for itself... ""Al Capone was one of the most notorious gangsters but this is the story of when he takes a dump in the bed as an old man.""... Josh trash.
The first person to propose this idea should have been fired immediately. The worst part is how this movie takes itself so seriously. It's not like it's so bad it's good. No it's just trash.

402,millersfinewatches,Don't Watch This to see Al Capone!,2,23 July 2020,"I came into this movie believing it was a story about the closing of Al Capones life, and not was I wrong! Not only that, the ""movie"" was a complete let down.Sadly, after 35 minutes into the film, when you keep saying to yourself, ""Self, this is all going to pull together and make some sense any moment, just hang in there"",... ... ... well, that moment never comes. Although the filmmaking types out there, may recognize the cinametoographry as well shot, (which it is) that doesn't help the rest of the viewers just trying to watch a movie for its storyline and plot. Two things which are extremely elusive at best in this film.
Some other reviews have tried to paint this as a film showing the ""real"" emptiness of a criminal life, not showing the false glamour as most do. I don't see this in that way at all. I see a film that the surreal and dreamlike states can't be differentiated between what's really happening, a plot that's not there, characters you never get to know or care about, all portrayed with an abundance of unnecessary vulgarity, and unrealistic family situations and reactions, in dealing with a family member who has dementia.
In other words, it was obviously written by those who've never been in direct care of a family member. It comes across more like it was written by a teenager in that respect.The movie fails on every aspect as far as I'm concerned, and unfortunately I can say nothing good about it, as far as storyline, plot, screenwriting etc.. Mist of the main characters lines are unintelligible, and after the first 10 minutes or so that just becomes obnoxious.I cannot recommend this film in any way.",Capone

405,nikitishna,My useless review from a sofa critic,9,16 August 2020,"So. I've never seen D. Trunk's work before. Either I'm too young or I'm too old for this. Quarantine, boredom and protective masks made me look at the new product on the Internet. And no, I don't go to the movies (I'm annoyed by the crunch of ruminants).
The first minutes of the film-little information. Who is Capone, how did he go to prison, for what? If I didn't know the history, I wouldn't understand it.
Well, that's better. The scene with the little girl and Fonzo himself is very pretty. I think that despite losing his mind, Capone was still a favorite of the children and basically loved them himself. I'm loving it.
Otherwise, if I had been thrown in the mud, I would have got up and gone for the Springfield rifle. Capone is patient.
However, he did not hesitate to explain the purpose of the holiday to a small relative.
+1 to the writer's karma.Alfonso urinates in his pants and asks his son not to tell his wife -quite shrilly. Fonzo just can't be weak to the end in her eyes. One more point for the Trunk.The scene on the boat tore my heart out. To be honest, I felt sorry for Alfonso.
""It's time for you to go to the psych ward!"" johnny, his loyal assistant, said gruffly.
Fonzo is no longer a gangster, but a child who needs care, love and diapers (this is too much, though frankly). We all end up getting our beds wet some day.Mae slapped him across the face - I'm crying again, guys. I feel sorry for the helpless Capone again.When he had the whole world under his feet, and now-the last statues are being removed for debt. Another plus sign.An illegitimate son? Yes, perhaps. Someone like him probably had a lot of them, two or three. These children are scattered all over the world. I'm loving it. Another point in favor of Josh.Memories and obsessive thoughts? For me, they are shown quite unusually. He listens to his ""exploits"" on the radio. This is a great move!A moment with a machine gun?
God, I've already buried half the helpers in his house. Fortunately, this is just his hallucination.In General, I liked the film. I think he was underestimated and misunderstood. I think the meaning is hidden somewhere deeper than we think. The screenwriter wanted to be a mystery, and it remained, but many could not solve it.D.Trunk of success and more ideas! Thank you!",Capone
406,ptiernanhome,Apalling,1,28 February 2021,Tom Hardy is a great actor but no story & the film didn't go anywhere. Was expecting flash back stories or something to spice it up. Basically just watching an old man deteriorating.,Capone

I love the fact that sometimes you feel lost in it, but that's absolutely normal cause you're in the sick brain of Al Capone's dementia, I mean.. What did u expect????Tom Hardy ridiculously perfect.I just didn't like that in the scene where Capone goes to toilet through that big crowd of people, when he looks his self younger in the mirror, that version of Capone looks so damned close to the real Capone, even more than the rest of the movie...",Capone

412,fancyerdang,The worst film of the year perhaps...,2,26 December 2020,"Such a waste of time and money for everyone, if it wasn't for Tom Hardy, this film would have been a total disaster and just unmeasurably bad.Was expecting to see a strong character at first, I mean Tom Hardy with that ""Scarface"" but REALLY ?! this film delivers nothing but bunch of ""enter the void"" type of fragments, however, got neither fluid camera works nor compelling storytelling, and most of all, all the emotional elements felt so artificial, much like subjective assumptions rather than hard facts. And i bet if anyone would dare to call that ""ART"" at all.Just hope to watch another GREAT Capone movie as opposite to this one completely.This one is absolutely disappointing and too bad to be explained in words even, just exceptionally awful.",Capone

426,bretlsanders,Tom Hardy is hauntingly brilliant as the fallen Al Capone,10,4 October 2021,I've always been of the opinion that America under-appreciates Tom Hardy for his depth as an actor. America did right by him in this movie though. His portrayal as the fallen Al Capone is so tragically fragile while still trying to hold on to that old bravado that he became famous for.I'm mad at the reviews the film critics gave of this movie. They don't get it. I think they were seeing it through the lens of what they expected it to be since Al Capone is such a famous name other than what it is actually meant to be.It's theatrical. It's not supposed to be based in historical accuracy. Little is know about Capone's final year and this movie takes that knowledge and runs with it. Most movies made about Capone's life are during his reign but here we get to see what it was possibly like for him when had fallen and he had no one but his wife and son to lean on. Everyone in the gang empire he had build abandoned him. Tom Hardy is brilliant in his portrayal of this possible haunting reality.,Capone

It has similar pacing to Joaquin Phoenix's, They Were Never Really Here (2017), which is also an excellent movie. Both provide a similar in pace, structure and loss of belief in the character's preconceived notion of what is actually happening around them.Tom Hardy always does a fantastic job immersing himself within his roles, and this characterization was no different. Truly one of the best actors of this generation. And for his performance alone, I recommend this movie.After reading countless user reviews, I started to understand why most who viewed this movie did not enjoy it for what is was. It is not a action/thriller that most had anticipated going into it, but a drama; a depth into the deteriorating mind of a life long criminal.Was this movie confusing? At times it was, as many mention the story was all over the place. This I perceived to be intentional, as Capone began to lose control, and his dementia took the reigns, the audience was forced to follow suit, riding the carriage with him into madness. Many of the scenes seemed pointless after the fact, but as time progressed and the movie reached it's conclusion all of his thoughts and memories materialized, highlighting that Capone was truly lost.

But the constant chopping and changing of direction, stop start and almost floaty story shows a perspective that very few films are brave enough to do showing the final year of Capone's life and the mental struggle with himself and family whilst everything collapses.It lacks story but tells a powerful story of the demented nature of a brutal disease in dementia.A new perspective on the already well documented life of Capone.",Capone

Waste of time.
If they eventually went back in time that would have made sense, but no they didn't. It was a pointless movie.
Shocking!",Capone

We can't all be wrong...,Capone
474,tkrogh,Many bad reviews. I read a lot of them. I still watched the movie. I loved it.,10,29 May 2020,"Tom Hardy delivers an exceptional performance as the once notorious gangster Al Capone. Not every movie has to be action filled. Not every movie has to tick all of the boxes that you think it should have. Not every movie should be the way you want it to be. For that, I loved this movie. It was entirely its own.Tom Hardys acting skills are simply astounding. He portrays Capone in a way that it has never been done before. If you are reading this, then by now you know that Al Capone was suffering tremendously in his last years. Hardy manages to capture that, and he gives a stunning performance.I closed the movie feeling sorry for Al Capone. He did some horrible things in his day, but no man deserves that horrible fate. Hats off to Tom Hardy for emerging himself into a role like that, staying in character and delivering this film. It must have been incredibly hard.If you have watched the movie and hate it so much that you have to come here and give such a terrible review then maybe the movie was not for you. Maybe Tom Hardy does something in this one that was too much for you to handle. If you expected a gangster movie then this is definitely not your classic gangster movie. It is, however, a different take. And I loved it.",Capone
475,jimmmz-50243,You can do better,3,18 May 2020,I am a great fan of Tom Hardy. After watching Capone I could not believe he can act in a such rubbish film. He was smoking cigar most of the film. He could not talk clearly. Acting was mediocre. The best thing about this film was the scenery.,Capone

480,wallybwick,"Hollow, Slow, Beautiful, Embarrassing but Purposefully So",7,1 September 2020,"It's extremely hard to describe this movie. What will be even harder to explain is why you should watch it. The bottom line is, if you're interested in taking a deeper look at an otherwise unhurried and rather blunt film, you might find something of worth here (as I did).Tom Hardy plays an aging Al Capone, once a renowned gangster now suffering from dementia. His performance in this movie is extremely understated (despite his glaringly obvious accent) and could be misinterpreted as a waste of potential with a capable actor. He has very little dialogue to work with throughout the film,-- so, for the most part, he relies solely on expressions and actions-- but that isn't necessarily a fault of the actor or the script. As you'll find for most of these seemingly obvious flaws, there is a conscious decision in making them. The script relies heavily on Hardy to deliver these non-verbal cues to the audience; sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't. For the most part though, Hardy manages to anchor the movie just enough to not let it sink in the water. As for the other actors in the film, they all turn in very acceptable and unexceptional performances. Again, this could be considered a flaw but it is a very intentional choice by Director Josh Trank.The editing and the script offer only bits and pieces of information, seemingly leaving it up to the audience to try and piece it together. But, by the film's end, I think it's very clear that the viewer (just like Capone) isn't given all the pieces. This choice is not to the benefit of the viewer as it makes you confused and rather irritated. Yet again, this is meant to put you in the shoes of Capone himself. While there are fragments of his past and reveals along the way, in no capacity does it try and solve a mystery of where the money is hidden (as suggested by all of the marketing). Instead, through beautiful cinematography, it seeks to put you in his shoes.This also means the watching experience inevitably won't be for everyone. It's by no means a thriller or a mystery as some of the trailers might presume. This movie is meant to give you insight into what it feels like to have deterioration of memories and personal events. In this respect, I found the film rather intriguing. The pacing is what a lot of people complain about and for good reason. To say this film is slow is an understatement. However, putting that aside, I don't see how any other pacing could have fit for this movie. Given the material, there aren't many alternatives that wouldn't end up betraying the director's vision.That being said, the big question is what was Trank's vision? I have alluded to it already, but this isn't a gangster movie or even a fall from glory movie. You never get to see Capone as his former self truly. All you see him as is a frail and ailing man suffering from dementia. The film seeks to capture what the experience is like for the individual himself (Capone) and occasionally some insight into the people around him. It doesn't give you answers but rather a hollowed-out interpretation of what is happening. At times it's very clear and concise (particularly with characters close to Capone) while at other points (mainly towards the end of the film) it becomes meandering and confusing. Unfortunately, this choice is ultimately a detriment to the audience. For many, this inconsistency in filmmaking will be seen as a flaw and not a conscious choice. For many more, this will be seen as the wrong choice to make.Somehow, despite all of these glaring choices, the film doesn't come off as pretentious either. The filmmakers feel genuine in their attempts to tell the story they wanted to tell. Is that story unsatisfying? Very much so. All in all, the slow-pacing, bizarre editing, and understated performances leave much to be desired. Yet those same issues give the movie a uniqueness. Intrigue is spun from being in the same shoes as the character and grasping for answers but never receiving them. Watch it if you have the patience.",Capone

483,joemontoto,💩,1,2 August 2020,This film is little more than a series of poorly acted vignettes that swing from embarrassing to unintentionally hilarious. Did the last year of a mentally impaired man really need to be dramatized? Don't waste your time.,Capone
484,seknop,"No story, no development",4,13 May 2020,"This is a movie about a demented person doing demented things: Hallucinating, being mean to people around him and soiling himself. Oh, and its Al Capone in his last year alive. The fact it is an infamous person and the good acting of the cast (90% Hardy, though) is the only reason for people to consider seeing this. There is essentially no story, basically just a characterization of the situation Capone was living in, and the only development is his deteriorating condition. There are seeds of potentially interesting sub-plots, but none of them lead anywhere.It seems the only value of a movie like this is to strip away the myths and reverence around figures like Capone, formerly powerful men, and showing that they, too, have demons and ugly ends.",Capone

489,sebastianmrsn,Title is unrelated to movie,3,17 January 2021,"Why name a movie about dementia 'Capone', when dementia depersonalizes people and makes them zombies. How was dementia different for Capone? If the title was 'Neurosyphilis', then it'd have deserved a 5. Extremely unengaging, pointless. When you title a movie based on a person's name, you depict what was that person most well known and details that the public can't access, paint a more detailed picture. In reality, this movie sells you the' Tom Hardy gangster Al Capone movie OMG it's gonna be awesome' and what it gives you is... expectation and disappointment . This Trank is smug and thinks highly of himself, like he's some sort of misunderstood artist, but in reality he just did a bad job and should admit it.

To avoid a regular movie? To surprise watcher? To make as for the sympathy?Tom Hardy is a fantastic actor who can play such a profound role, although he's great here, I get the impression that it doesn't matter to me, because without a good story there's no good movie, no matter how big the budget or a sounding name, how for the main actor, the same and for the director, and the storyteller...In the movie, Capone constantly sees enemies in the distance ... so I see a great story about the great Al Capone as he deserves in the future (please choose the same actor...In the end, I quote, the Engineer on the Titanic, who says to the owner of the ship, when they have already hit the rock: ""Congratulations!
