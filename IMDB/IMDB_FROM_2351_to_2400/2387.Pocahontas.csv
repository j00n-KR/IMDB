0,MartinHafer,"As long as you don't mind that your children are watching almost 100% fiction and not real history, it is entertaining",3,2 September 2006,"I am an American History teacher and this is the sort of film that causes people like me to grumble and complain because the film bears almost no similarity to the actual story of the founding of the Jamestown colony. But, it is because of this and how widely the movie was loved and accepted that I actually use it in my class discussions--teaching kids that much of our history is distorted or even completely fictional. Like George Washington's ""wooden teeth"", the ""fact"" that everyone in Columbus' day thought the Earth was flat and Betsy Ross making the very first American flag (all fiction, by the way), this film is a great example of bad history. Now understand, I am NOT an America-basher or live to destroy our national heroes--I just don't like it when something sacred like our history is treated with such blatant disrespect and cynicism.While my list would be HUGE, here are a few of the problems with the story: the girl's name was ""Matoaka"" not ""Pocahontas"" (this was a nickname, not her real name), she was about 11 or so and Smith an older man and so the romance in the Disney film is either disgusting or false (fortunately, there was no romance according to all but the Disney account), the whole head getting smashed like a pumpkin incident probably never occurred (Smith spoke of this for the first time 17 years after the fact and it was never recorded elsewhere before this--plus Matoaka publicly showed contempt for Smith--something that makes no sense if the story was true), Matoaka was kidnapped by the British and she did not willingly join them (as seen in POCAHONTAS II), and the natives were not ""tree-hugging hippies""--but real 3-dimensional people (for good and bad).If you can ignore all this, you are left with a heavy-handed and preachy film with a lot of New Age mumbo-jumbo about nature and talking trees and all that crap. Pleasant to the eye--but about as deep as Paris Hilton's personality. Bland and only mildly entertaining---and guaranteed to tick off anyone who cares in the least about the truth.",Pocahontas
1,TheLittleSongbird,"A couple of minor flaws, but this is a beautiful film!",8,17 February 2009,"Why on earth is this movie rated so low? It's even rated lower than some of the DTV sequels. That shouldn't happen. It is historically inaccurate, but why should that be an issue? All I want is a visually stunning film with great music, and that's what I got. The animation is splendid. America looked so rich in colour, and the colours were so bright. The songs are sometimes the weakest element of an animation. Here it is the main reason why this movie is so memorable. ""Colours of the Wind"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard, and I've sung it before. Pocahontas's singing voice is none other than the Broadway singer, Judy Kuhn, who was absolutely terrific. When I was 12, I tried to sound like her. The incidental music is also definitely the most lyrical of the Alan Menken scores. The weakest element of the film, is actually the character development. The protagonist, voiced by Irene Bedard, is very well done, but most of the other characters are not as effective. Mel Gibson has a singing voice, but his speaking voice is too monotonous to my liking, and Ratcliffe isn't a very likable or memorable villain at all(one of Disney's blandest villains actually), despite enthusiastic voice work from David Ogden Stiers. But Meeko and Flit are great fun, and Grandmother Willow was good too. Don't say this film is racist. Some of the imagery is fantastic in the songs of war and animosity, and the film has a great love story and message. The ending was actually quite effective and poignant. In conclusion, one of the least memorable of the Disney movies, is so worth watching. 8.5/10. Bethany Cox",Pocahontas
2,SnoopyStyle,Disney history,6,21 November 2017,It's 1607 London. Governor Ratcliffe leads an expedition looking to find a mountain of gold in exploiting the new world. Swashbuckling ship captain John Smith (Mel Gibson) encounters native princess Pocahontas and they fall in love. The two sides are on a collision course to war and only the two lovers can stop it.History as Disney princess drama can be dangerous territories. This one papers over some stuff leaving a questionable rendering from a kiddie history book. Ratcliffe is imbued with all the cartoon villainy. John Smith is the square jawed soldier with limited charisma and Pocahontas is the perfect heroine. The English side is not that compelling. It's too broad and too Disney. I find the native side much more compelling. It would serve the movie well to concentrate more on their point of view. It doesn't need the scenes from the English side. This does have the great song Colors of the Wind by Vanessa Williams as is in the Disney tradition. This is more Disney than history lesson. That's the only concern I have with this movie. Kids wouldn't understand the liberties taken with facts and adult wouldn't find this that compelling.,Pocahontas
3,Hitchcoc,"Folks, It's Not History",8,2 January 2017,"We must start with the foundation statement that this is not an historical retelling of the story of early America. We don't know what went on at that time, so we are off the mark at the beginning. Can you imagine the dark times that were involved in this era, with a group of settlers trying to establish some kind of community, and a Native American presence confused and afraid what was going on. So what Disney did was turn this into a folk tale which oral traditions have been doing forever (e.g. Paul Bunyan or John Henry or, more appropriately, Davey Crockett). I mean they sing and talk to trees. The romance had to be very strained. Throw in the search for gold and the greed, and you have a classic love in the face of barriers story. Also, there are a couple of terrific songs in this film. No, it's not ""The Lion King"" but many very good films are not ""The Godfather"" either. It doesn't mean they can't stand on their own.",Pocahontas
4,lee_eisenberg,"""Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas"" was the only interesting portrayal that I've seen",2,26 October 2007,"It was one thing for Disney to make animated features of self-proclaimed fictional stories (""Cinderella"", ""Aladdin"", etc.). But it's going too far to make a fantasy story and try to pass it off as history. That's just what they do with ""Pocahontas"". While they prided themselves on treating Indians more respectfully, the Indians come across as noble savages (meaning how white people prefer to view them, even if it is a positive portrayal). The images are very modern: Pocahontas is a princess with giant breasts and a skinny waist (a Barbie doll, if you will), while John Smith is a hunky dude.Around the time that the movie came out, I participated in a review of it on a local radio station. Having recently studied the history of Jamestown*, I could see that the movie got little if anything right, and so I challenged almost everything that the other reviewers said. The fact is that Disney - a corporation with kiddie entertainment as its main purpose - is not ready to tell the real story of what happened, and may never be ready to. As I understand it, when the English people first saw Pocahontas, she was naked and bald. The English, meanwhile, lacked any hygiene.All in all, if you want a realistic portrayal of the events surrounding the Jamestown settlement, this is the last version that you'll want to watch. But Terrence Malick's ""The New World"" isn't much better, lasting way too long and plodding the whole way through. The best version that I've seen is unfortunately one of the more racist ones: the Merrie Melodies 1938 cartoon ""Johnny Smith and Poker-Huntas"", starring Elmer Fudd's prototype Egghead as John Smith. As this cartoon was directed by Tex Avery, it was naturally chock-full of sight gags, the sort of stuff that one would expect to find in a Marx Brothers movie or a Leslie Nielsen movie. While it did contain the average stereotypical portrayals of Indians, it was one of the cleverest cartoons that I've seen.Now, I understand that some people might assert that ""Pocahontas"" doesn't have to be totally realistic. Maybe so, but the problem is that it claims to be based on historical events. I, for one, do not consider a fantasy pretending to be history very appropriate. In summer, 1995, Mel Gibson starred in - and directed - another less than totally accurate historical movie: ""Braveheart""; well, that one was much more accurate than this one. Just avoid this one, OK? *John Smith eventually had to return to England after getting injured in a gunpowder explosion. Without him, the rest of the colonists decided that they no longer had to do any work. Come winter, the settlement totally collapsed",Pocahontas
5,jboothmillard,Pocahontas,5,3 November 2008,"I remember seeing this Disney animated film at the cinema and crying at the end, I wondered if seeing it again I would have a similar reaction, and ultimately if I enjoy it. Basically Capt. John Smith (Mel Gibson) leads his crew of English sailors to the New World, with Governor Ratcliffe (Beauty and the Beast's David Ogden Stiers) greedy for the rumoured treasures. In this land lives a Native American tribe, with Chief Powhatan (Natural Born Killers' Russell Means) wishes his daughter, the beautiful Pocahontas (Irene Bedard, with Judy Kuhn singing), to marry the village's greatest warrior, Kocoum (James Apaumut Fall). Pocahontas however has had visions that a change is coming to the land, a true path she must follow, and obviously it is John, who she quickly falls in love with, and vice versa. Their love however cannot survive the war that soon grows between the New World and the English who may plan to destroy the land, both sides believing each other are savages. In the end, the war seems to be put to an end, and John is forced to leave when Radcliffe shoots hit, and he will most likely die if he stays, and Pocahontas decides to stay where she belongs. Also starring John Kassir as Meeko, Christian Bale as Thomas, Linda Hunt as Grandmother Willow, Billy Connolly as Ben and Frank Welker as Flit. The animation is as good as you could expect, the story is mildly interesting, with its ""love conquers all"" factual subject, but it doesn't measure up to the success of the year before's The Lion King, and Gibson's English accent is silly. It won the Oscar for Best Music, Best Song for ""Colors of the Wind"" (it also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score - Motion Picture. Worth watching!",Pocahontas
6,ccthemovieman-1,Anoher Reason For The Disney Boycott,1,6 July 2006,"You wonder why there was a big boycott of Walt Disney films and Disney World in the mid '90s and shortly thereafter. It wasn't just ""Gay Days"" at the theme park: it was Liberal revisionist ""history"" movies like this.Instead of the real story of Pocahontas, who became famous by being the first Native American converted to Christianity, we get ridiculous New Age mumbo- jumbo here. Yeah, it's the typical Disney brainwashing (this film is for young kids) in which the message is to worship (not just take care of) trees, earth, and all living things. The Disney empire is so strong on its heavy-handed left-wing agenda that it can't even remotely tell the truth about a story in an animated film.At the very least, since they abhor Christianity,they should have just stuck with a pretty animated movie (which this is) and centered it around romance and young America...but Liberals can't stop being in your face all the time, pushing their secular agendas on the rest of us. This movie is ""Exhibit A"" of that - a disgrace.",Pocahontas
7,moonspinner55,Latter-day Disney at their dullest...,4,26 January 2008,"English captain in 17th century Virginia falls in love with a Native American woman who, along with her people, fights to retain control of their land against the invading white man. Disney-animated rewriting of history is shameless in its pandering to political correctness (and advancing Pocahontas's age to include a star-crossed lovers sub-plot!). The sugary, forgettable music is certainly no help, although the film did cop two Academy Awards for the score and also the song, ""Colors of the Wind"". The animation is dull and flat, and the voice-over work is equally bland (Mel Gibson's John Smith not withstanding). *1/2 from ****",Pocahontas
8,edwagreen,Pocahantas Gets Her Man? ***,8,27 December 2008,"Wonderfully animated film, even if they distort history. Too bad the anti-Semite Mel Gibson had to play John Smith. A better role that would have been suited for that misery would have been Gov. Radcliffe.Back to the film, which is an interesting one,it depicts the basic reason for war-greed.The music is carefree and great. All sing well. As Willow, the Tree, Linda Hunt is impressive. (She usually is.)Too bad that the father's choice for Pocahantas had to catch a bullet. The way the film turned out, they really didn't have to kill him off that way. After all, we are dealing with a younger audience.",Pocahontas
9,CinemaSerf,You will recall the songs long after you've forgotten the film.,6,3 April 2020,"A gentle telling of the tale of early British settlers arriving in Virginia in the 17th century. Seeking gold, they found the indigenous population and pretty much set out to annihilate and/or enslave them. Pocahontas is curious to meet these white visitors and Capt. John Smith keen to reciprocate with both keen to prevent bloodshed and promote conversation and understanding between them. On the face of it, it is just an animated love story. Those looking for historical accuracy ought to look elsewhere; this is a vehicle of some good (not great) animation that touches on Native American traditions and beliefs (""The Willow Tree"" - voiced by Linda Hunt - being quite a poignant example) and for Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz's Oscar winning, if dreadfully sentimental songs. It is perfectly watchable, and perfectly forgettable in equal measure.",Pocahontas
10,utgard14,"""I'd rather die tomorrow than live a hundred years without knowing you.""",7,21 September 2015,"Disney take on the story of Pocahontas and John Smith. I just saw this for the first time since its initial release. My feelings back then were somewhat lukewarm but, to put that in context, my tastes were more narrow then and I was not really into Disney or anything that felt even slightly like a 'chick flick.' Now I'm happy to say I recognize what an enjoyable film this is. The animation is wonderful with so much beautiful imagery that it took me by surprise because I didn't remember that from my first viewing. The scene where John Smith first sees Pocahontas will take your breath away. The movie makes excellent use of lush colors. Some scenes are saturated with purples and blues -- it's really stunning. Pocahontas herself is gorgeously drawn. She's easily one of the most striking Disney Princesses ever. The score is evocative and lovely with one great song (""Colors of the Wind"") and some other forgettable ones. The voice work is wonderful, especially Irene Bedard in the lead. There are nice touches of humor throughout with a talking tree and playful animals that seem to have stepped right out of Bambi's forest. The emotional stuff is where the movie really knocks it out of the park, whether it be the romance between Pocahontas and Smith or little brilliant scenes such as when Powhatan feels his wife's spirit in the wind.The cause for much criticism and complaints about the film come, of course, from the history police. The movie is historically inaccurate, which should come as no surprise to anyone over the age of four. I'm never one to get all that worked up about historical accuracy in movies (let alone cartoons) anyway. You want to be entertained, watch this movie. You want to learn more about history, open a book. One charming reviewer here said the movie was guilty of whitewashing genocide. What a shocker that Disney didn't want to make an animated version of Soldier Blue! Look, it's a cartoon loosely based on people who lived and died 400 years ago. Unclench your fists, take a breath, and stop relying on Hollywood to educate your children and getting ticked off when they don't do it the way you want them to. It's a good animated film and I think everyone who isn't looking to get angry about as many things as they can before they die should see it.",Pocahontas
11,Calicodreamin,Colors of the wind,9,10 November 2021,"Pocahontas is one of my childhood favorite Disney movies with an epic soundtrack, colors of the wind is iconic. The animation is breathtaking, the characters well (voice) acted, and the storyline is honest.",Pocahontas
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"A mature animated Disney feature, and a beautiful film",7,9 November 2007,"This is somewhat unique, for a number of reasons. Perhaps most importantly, it is, as my summary states, mature. Gone are the talking animals, the show-stopping musical number(as were a staple of the Disney cartoons of the time), and the themes, the tone, is more serious. This is the only Disney animated feature actually based on a true event. There is still humor that the children can laugh at, and it's still much more simple and easy to take in than a lot of entertainment, but this has things for the grown-ups, as well. This seems to have lead to it being somewhat overlooked and less popular with kids. Another difference is how realistic the look is. The characters, the movements, faces, everything, it all looks far more real than other animated pieces. The animation is magnificent. The colors are used well, and quite subtly, in key sequences. The acting is good, and Bedard and Kuhn, the speaking and singing voice of the title character, respectively, are both excellent. Gibson isn't a bad singer, and he fits the character of Smith, both in attitude and voice. The majority of the actors lending their voices to the Indian characters are actual Native Americans, which is definitely an impressive and note-worthy detail. The music is great. Characterization is nicely done. For a film that's about an hour and fifteen minutes, sans credits, we know more about these people, and understand them better, than you'd expect. The plot is well-written, but of course it is a fictional recounting of the actual story(this is Disney, after all). The pacing is marvelous, it never really drags. The DVD extras are a mixed bag... not all are well-produced or aesthetically appealing(or even introduced properly). The multi-language reel, though, is well-cut and well-done, both idea and execution get high marks... although as much as I dislike Danish dubbing, I'm not sure that I was as relieved as I was insulted that the Danish voice was not part of it; the Swedish and Norwegian were! Also, the interactive adventure can amuse, and may inform. I recommend this to anyone willing to watch Disney, especially the more mature audiences. 7/10",Pocahontas
13,neil-476,Agenda-driven fantasy with some lovely animation,7,21 May 2020,"The British arrive in Virginia, under the leadership of gold-mad Ratcliffe. Captain John Smith meets Pocahontas, daughter of the local chief, and their budding romance may be instrumental in staving off hostilities - or perhaps it may make things worse.Disney's adaptation of the Pocahontas is a very loose adaptation indeed, and I don't just mean the comedy animal sidekicks or spirit-tree-Grandma. The story is greatly glamourised, not leasr in the character design of the beauty queen native American princess (who probably wasn't actually a princess). British leader Ratcliffe is clearly insane and all his men are sheep except Smith. The situation is clearly noble native Americans on the receiving end of violence and theft of land and resources from the vile British, which may explain why Mel Gibson was attracted to it. I'm sure there is some substance to this viewpoint, but this animated feature is very one-note.There is some lovel animation, and Alan Mencken's score is good, but the songs are rather lacklustre, even the much-feted Colors Of The Wind. This is one of the more disappointing entries from Disney's renaissance years.",Pocahontas
14,zetes,"Pretty and with good music, but not very good overall",6,23 July 2012,"After the huge success of The Lion King and the three films preceding it, Pocahontas effectively ended Disney's Renaissance in 1995. They've never been able to recover from it, relying instead on Pixar to carry the mantle (although I would argue that Disney has had a handful of films in the past ten years that rival, and are probably far better than their run from The Little Mermaid to The Lion King). Pocahontas has a few things going for it. Honestly, it's one of Disney's best looking films. The colors in particular are gorgeous. And the music is good, too. Not great, but I like it far better than the music of the The Lion King or Beauty and the Beast, both of which have horribly overrated music. The music of Pocahontas did, in fact, win two Oscars, for both score and Best Song (""The Colors of the Wind""). While I can sit through a film with such merits, the bad stuff really weighs it down. Disney really shouldn't have tackled a historical story, no matter how mythologized. And they REALLY shouldn't have added cutesy animal sidekicks. That's the biggest crime of the film by far, the raccoon and hummingbird that follow Pocahontas around, getting into trouble, and the bad guy's pug, all far too anthropomorphized. If Disney had attempted to make a more mature movie, it might have worked, but then maybe they couldn't have padded out the runtime with the animal antics. The film also suffers from a good amount of mid-90s political correctness. The conflict boils down to ""Argh! We're the evil white people and all we want to do is kill savages!"" and ""Ugh. We're noble savages who like corn, or, as we call it, maize. We love animals and nature and crap. Look, there's a talking, magical tree over there. And check out my daughter's pet raccoon! Isn't it funny?"" It's all terribly insulting. Still better than the boring The Lion King.",Pocahontas
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,"It wasn't the hit that Disney was looking for, but I think this was still a decent movie",7,19 January 2004,"Disney studios had hit the jackpot during the ""renaissance"" with The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. Beauty and the Beast was the first animated film to ever receive a best picture nomination during the Oscar season. They wanted to hit it out of the ball park again with Pocahontas. This is where Disney was starting to slide down a little bit again. Not to put this film down because it was wonderful, but there wasn't that special little spice that made the film a huge success like it's predecessors. The animation was just spectacular, the story(despite not being at all true to the story) was very good and the songs were beautiful. But why wasn't this the major hit Disney was looking forward too? I have several theories that I'll explain in just a moment.British settlers of the Virginia Company sets sail to the ""New World"". Onboard the ship are Captain John Smith and the voyage's leader Governor Ratcliffe, who believes the local Native Americans are hiding a vast collection of gold and seeks to gain it for his own. In the local tribe in the New World, Pocahontas, daughter of Chief Powhatan, dreads being possibly wed to Kocoum, a brave warrior whom she sees as too ""serious"" when conflicting with her spirited personality. Pocahontas, along with her friends, the raccoon Meeko and hummingbird Flit, visit Grandmother Willow, a spiritual talking willow tree who alerts her to the presence of the Englishmen. She meets John Smith and shows him the ""New World"" as he realizes the peace and love the tribe brings, they both try to bring a bond between their groups, but it might be more difficult than they realize.Why this film wasn't as big a smash as the studios wanted I think was due to the way the story was told. First off, I know that for Hollywood to keep the audience's interest they do need to have their own little twist on history, but why not keep more true to the story of Pocahontas? I suppose because her story wasn't enough to keep the kid's interest just like how they ""sexified"" her up. Although why does her nose look like Lord Voldemort? Seriously, can she breathe out of that thing? There is a massive stare fest between her and John Smith that felt more awkward than beautiful and romantic. There's also a lot of standing majestically which I thought made the characters look more like mannequins.However, I still like Pocahontas a lot. It's not the Disney movie I watch more than a few times, but the animation is just absolutely stunning, some of Disney's best. The songs like ""Colors of the wind"" and ""Drums of War"" were great. Even the side animal characters were really funny and cute. I would still recommend Pocahontas, not just for die hard fans of Disney, but it's a terrific family film that I'm sure anyone could enjoy as long as you don't take it seriously like some other crazy people have, it's a movie! People need to check the size of their underwear, it may be time for a bigger size.7/10",Pocahontas
16,OllieSuave-007,Not one of the better ones from Disney.,4,4 November 2013,"This is Disney's 33rd full length-animated feature film, a story about Capt. John Smith and a group of English sailors trying to find gold and riches in a Virginia territory, which is inhabited by native Pocahontas and her tribe. The plot goes on as a tug-a-war between the settlers and the natives, with the former trying to claim new territory and the latter trying to reason with them settlers to leave them alone as they are not the ""savages"" they claim they are.This movie is another piece of beautiful animation work, with wonderful songs such as ""Colors of the Wind"" and ""Just Around the Riverbend."" The story, however, wasn't very captivating and it was told in a way that is too dramatic and dreary for Disney (i.e., too much preaching between the tribe and the settlers about each other's own rights and privileges; people getting shot; unhappy climax). This film definitely doesn't have that special Disney touch. In addition, from what I understand, this film doesn't follow the true history of Pocahontas and John Smith, which gives the wrong message to viewers.Overall, a less happier and exciting Disney movie that I wouldn't mind not watching again. There are much better Disney films out there from the 1990s than this one. Grade D",Pocahontas
17,FeastMode,bad,2,6 July 2020,"I've been rewatching some of the animated disney classics, only the more modern ones, with the little mermaid being the earliest. this might be the worst of them.it's overall poorly put together. not funny. the songs are pretty bad except for colors of the wind. there really isn't much here at all. i did like some of the animation backgrounds with vibrant colors. but the animation of the people looked off to me. they all looked really flat.

18,Lejink,Indian reservations,6,26 October 2013,"Just watched this film on a rainy stay-in Saturday afternoon and it fitted the bill nicely. A romanticised re-telling of the celebrated romance between English soldier John Smith and Indian princess Pocahontas, it entertains in the main even if it occasionally panders a little too much to the pre-teen market with just too many cute animals whose presence you think may, in true JarJar Binks style, have had more to do with spin-off merchandising than enhancing the narrative. The overly-idealised images of the dashingly handsome, heroic and muscular Smith and the gamine and exotic beauty of Pocahontas for me somehow manage to somehow belittle their characters, at the expense of credibility and I suspect, true audience sympathy, but in its favour, the film arrives at a not completely happy-ending which is to its credit.Of course, being a Disney film, there has to be an identifiable bad guy for our hero and heroine, here personified by the greedy, avaricious figure of Lord Ratcliffe who has commissioned the expedition in a last-gasp attempt to strike it rich with the discovery of gold and also enhance his failing social position at court back home. Again however, he's too broadly painted for my taste, massively corpulent and duplicitous from the start. Likewise the contrast between the uncaring colonialists and the innocent native Indians comes across as clumsy and clichéd too.Maybe I'm being too severe, as all Disney animated films seemingly must posit, for the kids as much as anyone else the big moral of good versus evil, but being based this time on a true story and not a fairy tale, felt more subtlety could have been observed in the telling.On the plus side, the songs are good, with clever lyrics, even if you're not exactly whistling them after the film is over and the animation is fluid and engaging, although again i didn't recall too many ""Wow!"" stick-in-the-memory moments immediately afterwards. The voice acting too is mostly good although Billy Connolly's too-old and overly-recognisable broad Scottish accent jars occasionally.Maybe I'm being over-critical and it's easy to slightly denigrate the film with reference to previous Disney classics, but while pleasant enough, this didn't feel like one of the studio's very best outings.",Pocahontas
19,ElMaruecan82,Full of colors but not colorful enough ...,7,12 December 2011,"Only one year after ""The Lion King"", that can be considered as the pinnacle of Disney Renaissance, was released the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"", that would pave the way to a whole new generation of animated films. 1995 was the year of the 3D revolution, which -let's face it- didn't leave much room for 'the first animated Disney feature based on a true story'.I don't intend to be ironic, because on its own, ""Pocahontas"" is a decent film with some solid animation but as much as I respect and appreciate the fact that the film tried to detach itself from Disney roots and deal with more adult and historically relevant material, I'm just sorry that it didn't succeed on the field of entertainment as it did on music and imagery. Something was missing and the movie did to me the same effect that an appetizing dish served in a beautiful plate but failing on the most crucial test. 'Pocahontaste' lacked the little extra spice, a pity when you consider how dazzling the cinematography was.I insist on the imagery because it contains such a great escapist value that if only for that, it's hard to maintain a negative opinion toward the film, ""Colors of the Wind"" and the shot of Pocahontas rafting on the wild river is such a powerful image that it deserved a more interesting story to build around, especially since the film was intended to be a romance. But the romance proved again to be a tricky genre for Disney films as the least likely to entertain or to inspire empathy, unless it's saved by comic relief elements, scene-stealing sidekicks or memorable villains, which ""Pocahontas"" didn't have. And go entertain a bunch of candy-eating kids in the movie theater with an Indian princess who falls in love with a British soldier, when one year before, it was about the coming-of-age story of a young lion who to become the king, and when a bunch of toys were living a great adventure.""Pocahontas"" was meant to fail because of its own story, too historically loaded to introduce some fantasy elements and when it tried, it didn't go too far. When you make a tree speak through the soul of a deceased grand-mother, why not make the little animals speak for God's sake?! I have nothing against the raccoon and the hummingbird, but I'd be damned if they made me even smile once, their cuteness was on the same level of Disney's 1932 ""Flowers and Trees"" and whoever created them should have remembered that if a character doesn't add anything significant to the plot, at least, he must have some redeeming qualities, and 'being cute' isn't one.The secondary characters were so weak, that even the running gag involving the little rivalry between the raccoon and the dog didn't work for me, and although I watched the film only one year ago, I doubt that would have made me laugh either when I was 13, and certainly not as hard as Rafiki, Timon, Pumbaa or Genie, Abu or the magic carpet. And even if we give ""Pocahontas"" the benefit of doubt and consider that many other Disney films featured forgettable sidekicks, I doubt they also had forgettable villains. And since the thrills and interest of the story is driven by the antagonist, ""Pocahontas"" deserved more than a buffoon like Ratcliffe, not in the same league than Ursula, Jafar or the flamboyant Gaston.I hate to sound so technical, but there are some tacit rules established since the release of the first animated feature: every ""Snow White"" needs her ""Seven Dwarfs"" and ""Evil Queen"", and they might even be more important. While the princess is the emotional core, a good Disney film is judged on its capability to scare and to make people laugh, and if it can work with bland and even dull heroines, it can't without strong supporting characters. Not all the Disney movies were romances of course, the others were generally quests or coming-of-age stories driven by young characters: Bambi, Pinocchio, Arthur or Mowgli whose identification was much easier, probably the key of ""The Lion King"" and ""Toy Story""'s appeal.""Pocahontas"" had nothing special to impact the memories, and if it didn't sink into oblivion, it's probably a miracle due to the high quality of the film. But the story is just too mature: not enough fantasy, not enough colorful characters, it's even as if the writers were trapped by the content of their own stories, victim of this politically correct depiction of Natives, so angelic that the movie falls into a sort of reverse racism with the whole communion-with-Mother-nature stuff, so defining of the 90's and so hypocritical when you consider that the animators didn't embarrass themselves with depicting some Arabs in a stereotypical way in ""Aladdin"", while they were more sensitive about the portrayal of Natives for obvious reasons.The result is a sort of animated ""Dances With the Wolves"" so noble-spirited, so wise, that it's almost offensive not to love this film, when you take it from an adult point of view. But that's the problem because Disney films are precisely about awakening the inner child inside us, and while I'm writing this, I try to remember why I didn't want to watch the film when it was released, when I didn't know anything about the stuff I just wrote. And I just found out why: the movie that tries to be the least possibly offensive is still offensive, because with her geometrically drawn face, I never found Pocahontas pretty at all, and she was probably the least physically appealing of all the Disney princesses.And that, my friends, is so offensive in my opinion it canceled out all the good intentions...",Pocahontas
20,g-bodyl,Another Creative Disney Effort!,8,5 January 2015,"We all know that the 1990's were home to the Disney Renaissance, in other words a return to form for Disney Animation. This film, Pocahontas is one of those films. But I view this film as the weakest of the bunch. It's not bad or anything, but I am very historically-minded and the historical inaccuracies just couldn't be so obvious as it was distracting at times. That being said, there is plenty to adore about this film. The songs, composed by Alan Menken, are incredible especially that song, ""Colors of the Wind."" The animation is lavish and it provides some beautiful sights in the Virginia Territory.This film tells the tale of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith and the romance that sprung up between two cultures, thus creating a clash. The English, led by Governor Ratcliffe, are bound for the New World in order to find gold. The Indians, led by Powhatan, has Pocahontas being married off to the greatest warrior of the village, but she believes she has a different path to follow.This film does have a solid voice cast. Mel Gibson does fine voice work as John Smith and I am very surprised he has a singing ability. The unknown Irene Bedard does a decent job as the titular character herself. We also get good supporting voice acting from the likes of Christian Bale and David Ogden Stiers.Overall, Pocahontas is a good movie with beautiful animation and wonderful music. But I am usually the one of the few that can overlook historical inaccuracy, but not this time due to it being blatantly obvious. Despite being on the B-tier of Disney movies, this film does manage to inspire and tell a tale of a forbidden romance. The film can be pretty funny at times thanks to the shenanigans of the raccoon and the Governor's dog. All-in-all, not a bad movie. Don't expect this film to be like the Little Mermaid. I rate this film 8/10.",Pocahontas
21,cricketbat,One great song wrapped in a mediocre movie,4,11 August 2019,"Pocahontas is one great song wrapped in mediocre movie. After The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, it seemed that Walt Disney Animation Studios could do no wrong, but this appears to be when Disney passed the torch of quality films with heart over to Pixar, since this came out the same year as Toy Story.",Pocahontas
22,CuriosityKilledShawn,Too straight-forward to leave any lasting impact,6,3 February 2015,"Disney hit a rut in the late-90s with a string of critical and audience failures that began with Pocahontas and lasted through Hunchback, Hercules, Dinosaur etc. It was also one of two historically- inaccurate movies starring ""Mad"" Mel Gibson that came out in Fall 1995 in the UK. Both of which I never got to see until much later.From a technical standpoint there is nothing wrong with Pocahontas, as a matter of fact it's far more colorful, atmospheric, and grown-up than The Lion King, which came out a year before. But in the process it lost much of its younger audience and now only seems to appeal to adults. The story lets everything else down. It's so bland and generic when it could have had the moxie to go much further and be just a tad more complex. It certainly had the visual energy to back it up even it were to try and fail. Alan Menken's score is also horrible and totally inappropriate to the scenes he is supposedly enhancing. Songs come and go, some last only a few moments. If feels like instead of letting the visuals speak for themselves Disney decided that characters talking to each other (at the audience) as a means of delivering exposition was too obvious so instead this dialogue is sung. The songs are exposition. Rarely do they allow any visual storytelling to stand alone. John Smith's first encounter with Pocahontas at the waterfall being the best example of what the film could have been if only.Despite being historically-inaccurate (why is she not topless?) it really only details the first half of the Pocahontas story. The second (and more tragic) half is (sorta) detailed in the cash- grab sequel that nobody remembers. I cannot imagine anyone being smitten by this film unless they are already familiar with Pocahontas as the stripped-down story is hardly likely to win over anyone new to this slice of romantic history.",Pocahontas
23,Bored_Dragon,"Cute, but forgettable",5,8 February 2018,"A very nice story with a lot of potential that this film wasted. The first half of the movie is slow-paced and boring, while everything is happening in the second half, so the story is quick and undeveloped. I have the impression that I've watched an introductory episode of a series rather than a complete rounded movie. Song ""Colors of the Wind"" may have earned the Oscar that year (I do not know what was its competition), but music as a whole is below Disney's level. There aren't any catchy songs that once you've heard them you'll never forget. I finished this movie about 15 minutes ago and I already can't remember any of them.

Personally I don't think it's that bad. It's not as good as the other Disney movies released around that time. Aladdin, Beauty & The Beast, Little Mermaid and of course The Lion King are vastly superior!! But it's not the awful movie you may remember!! I'll probably never watch it again in my life, and truthfully if my girlfriends daughter wasn't sat watching with me, I may have even turned it off, but I have sat through worse.

27,tomgillespie2002,"Less fondly-remembered of Disney's catalogue, but deserves more credit",6,25 May 2016,"Made during the era now known as the 'Disney Renaissance' between 1989 and 1999, Pocahontas is one of the least fondly remembered of a wave of films that also included the likes of The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and The Lion King (1994), all of which are now considered giants of the Disney back-catalogue. It received mixed reviews upon its release, with some seeing a bravery in the films desire to tell a more serious story, and others lamenting its lack of memorable musical numbers and three dimensional supporting characters. And 'mixed' is precisely the way I felt when the credits started to roll.In 1607, a ship named the Susan Constant arrives at the New World carrying settlers and fortune-seekers from England. Led by the dastardly Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) who means to strip the lands of all of its riches so he can return to England as a success, the ship also carries the dashing John Smith (Mel Gibson), the captain seen as a hero by his crew-mates after saving young deck-sweeper Thomas (Christian Bale) from drowning during a storm. Further inland, the beautiful and free-spirited Pocahontas (Irene Bedard, with Judy Kuhn providing the singing vocals) fears the prospect of marriage to stoic warrior Kocoum (James Apamunt Fall), arranged by her father and tribe chief Powhatan (Russell Means). As tensions between the settlers and the natives grow, Smith and Pocahontas form a romantic bond that will shake the foundations of both camps.Pocahontas deserves to be applauded for its refusal to gloss over the racial aspects of a story aimed primarily at children. Smith isn't simply the traditional square-jawed Disney prince, and early on boasts about the amount of 'savages' he has killed during his adventuring. There's clearly blood on his hands but, through his relationship with Pocahontas, learns of the value and importance of nature, as well as the peaceful ways of her tribe's culture. The song Savages has both sides portraying the other as, well, savages, demonstrating their natural fear and distrust of a culture they know little about. Yet there is a distinct lack of fun to the film, with only Pocahontas's animal side-kicks providing some much-needed light-hearted comic relief. Outside of the two leads, the supporting characters are wafer-thin, with Ratcliffe paying the moustache- twirling villain, and Powhatan the wise, mystical old man. It's also unlikely you'll be whistling the songs afterwards.",Pocahontas
28,Dr_Coulardeau,The acme of re-evaluation,10,29 June 2012,"John Smith is made the captain of the ship. He is humane and he is able to save a man overboard in the middle of a tempest. He is a discoverer and goes out to meet the Indians, and he meets Pocahontas, the daughter of the chief Powhatan who is seen as a warrior and not an old man. The Europeans are shown a little bit more realistically than usual and they use row-boats to go up and down the river, not Indian canoes, like in most other versions.Pocahontas is shown as a young woman and not a girl, who is adventurous in her own way though at first distant and even fearful. But she accepts contact rather easily and she introduces John Smith to her grand mother Willow, a willow that speaks and gives advice.This meeting of John Smith and Pocahontas is amplified by the meeting of Pocahontas' raccoon and Ratcliffe's pampered dog. This is both charming and funny, how the savage raccoon is so much apter to survive any kind of trouble coming from a civilized dog than the reverse. The third animal here is a humming bird who is the jester of the triad.At this moment Thomas, a young sailor who had followed John on Ratcliffe's order, tries to protect John Smith against Kocoum who had followed Pocahontas, shoots Kocoum dead. Then John Smith, who protects the young chap, is submitted to an ordeal, a path of torture between two lines of Indians hitting him with any bludgeon they may have. He is saved by Pocahontas in extremis. Here the Indian custom is not specified, because of course it is not the case here: a woman who has lost family in a battle can claim a prisoner to replace the dead relative. This is the weak point of the film because Pocahontas' claim is not justified from the Indian point of view. That makes Powhatan weak.But the most important part of the film is the showing of the opposition of two cultures, two visions of the world.Powhatan declares: ""These white men are dangerous. No one is to go near them."" That's pure fear in front of the thunder sticks, the rifles.But then John Smith explains to Pocahontas what follows. ""We'll show you people how to use this land properly, how to make the most of it."" And he retorts to Pocahontas' objection as follows. ""You say that because you don't know better."" And he calls the Indians ""savages"" which causes the retreat of Pocahontas. Then he explains his mind. ""Savage is just a word, a term for people who are uncivilized."" That's burning his boat and then sinking the ashes. Pocahontas conclusion is just to the point. Savages are people who are ""not like you."" And that's when a war starts.The two cultures, Indians and English men, are just the same and they sing the same song about savages, the savages being of course demons on the other side. Powhatan leads the Indian movement as the chief of them when the warriors from other tribes have arrived. Ratcliffe leads the English but for his own narrow-minded, violent, even cruel, and greedy motivations.Grand Mother Willow advises Pocahontas properly, the raccoon brings Jim Smith's compass it had stolen a long time before and that's the dream: a spinning arrow showing the way. Pocahontas takes John Smith with her and they go to Powhatan to stop the war just when the two armies are face to face. Powhatan accepts his daughter's demand. ""My daughter speaks with the wisdom beyond her years. We've all come here with anger in our hearts, but she's come with courage and understanding. From this day if there's to be more killing, it will not start with me."" The fool then is Ratcliffe who tries to shoot Powhatan, but John Smith gets in-between and It is John Smith who is shot. He has to go back to England, to be cured and healed, or to die on the ship taking him to England. That ending is a lot better than going back to England to cure and heal severe burns caused by his dumb smoking next to a bag of gun powder.So what's the meaning of the film? Definitely a call for wisdom in the relations between ethnic groups, a total evacuation of the invasion of Indian territory by Europeans, a discrete allusion to the genocide that was to come later on, a total absence of real commerce between the English and the Indians, the fact that the Europeans do not seem keen on starting survival activities like cultivating the land or hunting properly.The film is in fact entirely transferred from the historical point of view to the sentimental point of view, as a metaphor of the ethnic situation.When John Smith falls in love with Pocahontas and is a prisoner destined to be brained alive or rather brained dead on the following morning he tells Pocahontas: ""No matter what happens to me, I will always be with you, forever."" And when John Smith is being taken to his ship, Pocahontas says: ""No matter what happens to me, I will always be with you, forever."" Perfect echo, perfect metaphor.The animals show the same meaning with Ratcliffe's dog dressed in an Indian cape at the very same moment when Powhatan put his own cape on the wounded John Smith on his stretcher.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Pocahontas
29,johnnyboyz,"It has its songs, its attempted humour and its out of this world ideas but it fails to be anything too fantastic.",6,3 June 2007,"Pocahontas was the first Disney film that I'd seen in quite a while and I had forgotten the enjoyment and magic that Disney films can often give you. Although I've probably seen most Disney films over the years, it was interesting to revisit this particular title after so long and view it with a more adult mind.One thing that you notice right away is that Pocahontas is not as epic as previous Disney films. There isn't a lot of animation and that cliché 'every effort is put into every drawing and thus; every frame' seems to have fallen through the net this time round. Because of this; the animation looks not only dated but it makes some of the characters (namely the lead heroine Pocahontas herself) ""kinda' funny lookin'."" That feeling that this is not as epic as previous instalments is also present. I don't know if Disney were going for the whole neo-realistic look or something since this is based on a true story (something Disney rarely do) but the actual drawings do fall a little flat. Hey, maybe they were putting all their animation effort into Toy Story from the same year; you never know.The film is clever and at the same time interesting at the start. We spend enough time with the sailors across their voyage and the protagonist is pretty obviously presented to us as John Smith since not only is he the one that saves a fellow sailor from drowning (Voiced by Christian Bale, no-less) but he's also voiced by Mel Gibson  more than enough evidence to suggest this is the leading man. Also, we get a peek at the native American's way of life which, unless you've studied pre-colonial America, is going to look pretty alien to you. This is the film giving us an even amount of time with either 'side' and is dangling a proverbial carrot in front of our faces, tempting us to make a link with either the sailors or the natives.The film is, overall, a very sophisticated story about friendship, trust and ultimately: love and the fact it's between two people from very different backgrounds and ways of life is all the more pleasurable. Even though it is a true story, Disney takes the material and makes good with it. What I didn't like though, was the fact that the animals whom are supposed to act as the films comic relief are actually more annoying than funny. I appreciate that it's 'just for kids' but where a proper love story is unfolding, two bumbling animals in the shape of Meeko (Pocahontas' racoon) and Percy (The English governor's dog whom he doesn't even realise is missing towards the end) attempt to ruin what it is that's going on around them. The fact they don't talk means that their actions have to make up for any amusing dialogue they might have had and when you have to rely on actions to make you laugh, you have to rely on slapstick and that really misses the mark in this film.The songs are impressive in their own right; like I said before, they're not as epic as previous films and consist of characters running through forests or boating down rivers with not much happening around them and with the same shades of colours and shapes used consistently. This is not like The Lion King (I Just Can't Wait to be King) or Aladdin (Never Had A Friend Like Me) where lots was going on and, arguably, better songs were presented to us. The willow tree was also something I had a bit of a problem with. Although acting as the mentor for Pocahontas, I felt that it broke too far from reality and wasn't even used that much anyway. I feel the film would've worked better had this character been a really elderly native American whom Pocahontas could've trusted but again, the prospect of a talking tree in a Disney film gets the kids in.Even if I was a little let down by the climatic battle scene since I didn't really 'feel' anything (when I felt I was supposed to have many emotions raging at once), the film sticks to its roots and has the ending that many of us probably wouldn't have liked to have happened. This is a strong Disney addition and shouldn't be overlooked.On a side note, if you liked this then check out 'A New World' (2005). It's another Pocahontas film and funnily enough, stars Christian Bale as well.",Pocahontas
30,filipemanuelneto,"A remarkable, wonderful film, but that shows nothing of historically true.",7,11 May 2017,"This is certainly one of the most notable animation films that Disney did in the 1990s. It has an undeniable quality, with exquisitely done animations, great songs and fun suitable for children and adults. However, its impossible to get around an undeniable fact: all that the film portrays is fiction, imagined around names of historical characters who actually existed. The connection between this film and historical facts ends in these names. Everything, absolutely everything else, was created in the minds of Disney's writers and creators. So pay attention, history teachers and parents: don't think that this movie has any connection with history. Another problem of the film is to approach in a very stereotyped and slight way the two confronting cultures (the colonizers and the Native Americans, its understood). But since its a children's film, this kind of lightness is forgivable.One of the highlights of the movie is music. Several of his songs were remarkable, especially for my generation, who was a child when the film was released. ""Colors of the Wind"" is perhaps one of the most poetic songs used in a Disney movie, it stays in the ear with great ease and the animation used during the music is excellent. In fact, the synchronicity of visual animation and music is something very well made. This movie is great if it's seen as an entertainment fiction, like an animated children's movie that does not show anything true.",Pocahontas
31,TheMovieDiorama,Pocahontas is brisker than the colours of the wind.,6,1 April 2018,"Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon? No, me neither, and after watching this you wouldn't have either. Reason being is due to the extremely rapid pacing for a ridiculously short animation. These two fundamental detriments makes this a slight misfire from Disney. Captain John Smith sails across to ""The New World"" where he encounters Pocahontas who he madly falls in love with. The indigenous population is under threat from the wave of modern colonisation. Disney clearly have good intentions as they fictionalise the account of Native American Pocahontas in order to illustrate colonialism to a younger generation. The basic storytelling allows the intended audience to swan dive right into this romantic epic with the colourful animation and harmonious musical numbers. Let's face it, ""Colours of the Wind"" and ""Just Around the Riverbend"" are two of Disney's strongest original songs that imitate the natural idyllic environment that the animation conveys. For the more mature audience, the racial overtones throughout the narrative just aren't dealt with carefully. John Smith exclaiming ""I prefer hello"" as Pocahontas teaches him about her own linguistics just seems so careless, leaving a bad aftertaste. Pocahontas is one of the more famous Native Americans, the historical depiction surrounding her and the indigenous culture was highly inaccurate. However, I have to give praise to the narrative for carrying a surprisingly thoughtful message that allows the viewer to meditate on what is being shown. The use of colours plays a major role in this, especially when the colonials are deforesting the picturesque woods in which a dark blood red shade swamps the background. I appreciate the lack of humour, it enhances the seriousness of the film. The romance between the leads, much like the whole film, is brisk and feels slightly underdeveloped. The primary antagonist may metaphorically represent modernisation, but is hardly memorable. Having said all that, the film isn't necessarily bad, just underdeveloped and misrepresented.",Pocahontas
32,Vartiainen,"Not the greatest Disney film, but much better than some would have you believe",7,10 November 2015,"You know what, all you overly sensitive American critics out there. You're right, the Native Americans portrayed in this film are either a mishmash of different tribes, if not outright wrong. You're right, there are no majestic hillsides and mountains on the shores of Eastern USA. And yeah, there sure are no talking trees there either. You know what, as well? I don't care! It's a Disney film. I don't think ancient Chinese warriors were lead into battle by tiny dragons who sounded like Eddie Murphy. Neither do I think that Ancient Greece was the birthplace of gospel music.The fact that the story took liberties with the source material is no reason to dismiss a Disney film. On the other hand, the fact that the story itself has some major problems, is.But, even though this film is pretty much the most hated of the Disney Renaissance films, it did get a lot of things right as well. There are no mountains in the Eastern USA, but they sure do look pretty as the backgrounds of this film. The animation is all around flawless. The more simplistic character models take a minute to get used to, but after that they look very good. The songs are also very good, with Colors of the Wind being one of my all-time favourite Disney songs. And even though the Native American shown here don't bear as much resemblance to the real thing as some would like them to, I always thought they were pretty cool. They had a flourishing civilization going on, yet it was clearly different from the European one. They were fearless warriors and the movie shows these two peoples as equals, both in their capacity for good as well as for evil. That's a very good lesson to teach to children.But unfortunately the story isn't one of Disney's better ones. It's too simplistic, too safe, too what you'd expect. Most of the other Renaissance films took chances, delving into some rather dark places in the process. They weren't simply cookie cutter films produced to make money. I don't get that feeling from Pocahontas. Because, when you get down to it, what's the most basic plot an animated film could tell if you had to tell a story about the colonization of America? Easy, you say. An early pioneer comes to America from Europe, meets a cute Indian girl, the two sides resist, tensions rise, but of course eventually you'll have your happy ending. Well that's Pocahontas.And they had so many options to go with. They could have shown us time, even years, passing as these two peoples slowly learned to tolerate each other, with Pocahontas and John Smith working as the bridge. They could have increased the amount of supernatural, now we only have Grandmother Willow. They could have drawn inspiration from actual Native American legends and myths. Anything but this poor man's Romeo and Juliet.Nevertheless, I do think it's a good film. Sure, the characters and the story are not as good as they could have been, but they're still good enough. And, as stated, the production values and technical aspects are pretty much flawless. Not deserving of its scorn, would be my final word.",Pocahontas

It's also interesting to hear a young Christian Bale involved as Thomas. Billy Connolly appears too, though only minorly.The animation and music are the key parts to this.

37,MissSimonetta,Disney Oscar bait,5,10 October 2014,"Pocahontas (1995) is popularly regarded as the film which led to the death of the Disney Renaissance. While I am of the opinion that this period reached its peak with Beauty and the Beast (1991), I do agree that this misfire marked the beginning of the end of Disney's second golden age.While the animation and color palette are gorgeous, and the musical numbers are classic, the character design is overall unexpressive. The story is recycled and dull, and the characters are all one-dimensional. Pocahontas and John Smith may be the most uninspired lovers in the Disney canon, generating little chemistry.Then there's the historical inaccuracy. The real Pocahontas' life was nothing at all like what is depicted here and I feel it was insensitive of Disney to turn such a painful and bloody part of history into an animated fairy tale for the family crowd. Altering an adult novel like The Hunchback of Notre Dame is no big deal, in my view, but whitewashing over history is much more problematic.Of course, this movie is also pretentious, trying to be so much more epic and important than it is, trying its best to top the maturity of Beauty and the Beast and nab another Best Picture nomination.

I thought in terms of subject matter, things were handled well. My feeling on presenting history inaccurately is that you shouldn't be expecting Disney movies to be faithful to anything other than marketability.

42,Spleen,Whenever I see this film it's always better than I'd remembered.,8,14 October 1999,"So why don't I have a better memory?  I think it's because the flaws in `Pocahontas' are of the kind most likely to be noticed by lovers of fine animation like myself.  The following paragraph will read like nit-picking, but I must write it and get it out of the way.The canoes, the GARISHLY coloured bark on Mother Willow - almost all of the computer-generated bits and pieces just look ugly and ill at ease in this hand-drawn world.  Just because we CAN use 3-D software, doesn't mean we MUST ...  And Disney's fabled character animation is a bit of a let-down, too.  The general character mould is meant to evoke a kind of cheap wood-cut, which is fine, but the style doesn't appear to lend itself to fluid or convincing or appealing movement.  The English crew have little personality, and the Native Americans might as well have been carved as drawn.This does NOT apply to Pocahontas herself.  (Who is, incidentally, a gorgeous babe.  This is not important.  I just thought I'd mention it.) During the scene in which she and John Smith first meet face-to-face we're as mesmerised as they are: it looks as if they're just standing still; but, of course, if they WERE just standing still, it wouldn't work at all. THAT'S animation for ya.  Meeko, the comic relief raccoon, is another triumph.  I've always thought Disney's animals to be far funnier than, say, Warner Brothers', largely because the animators are expressing the animal's character with the drawings rather than pasting gags on top of the character: were I to argue this case at length, Meeko would be one of my star exhibits.My only real complaint about the story is that we're rushed through it a bit too quickly.  Twenty more minutes - fifteen - could have made all the difference.  When will the day come when animated films aren't all the same length?  But it's moving enough even so.  If animation still lives in a children's ghetto, we should blame not the creators - who lavish more imagination and feeling on their work than is ever lavished on stuff like `Ten Things I Hate About You', to far less critical reward - but the audience.",Pocahontas
43,invisibleunicornninja,Boring and offensive.,4,5 December 2018,"I couldn't even finish this movie. The story is so bland and uninteresting. All the musical sequences are ear-gratingly bad. Even some of the voice actors sound bored. The most enjoyable moments are some of the random slapstick with the animals, but even that gets boring after a while. I don't see how any child would be entertained by this, never mind an adult.The historical inaccuracies just add to the misery that is this movie. I'm not expecting the peak of realism from a Disney Princess movie where magic wind translates languages, there is a talking tree, and raccoons and hummingbirds understand situations - but they could've at least made up new names and a fake location or something. This movie is kind of sanitizing the horrible things that actually happened in history. On top of that it doesn't even do it in an interesting or creative way. It's just dull.I will give credit where credit is due. While all the human faces are straight out of the uncanny valley, the overall look of this movie is very good. The visuals are georgeous. The animators really are talented. Such a shame they had to work on this terrible movie.I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie",Pocahontas
44,Lady_Targaryen,Two different worlds. One true love.,7,22 January 2006,"'Pocahontas' is far from being my favorite movie from Disney, but it is cool anyway. Pocahontas is the daughter of a Native American tribe chief. She is a free spirited and a beautiful young woman, and she knows every little place and creature in the forest she lives. She also has a big taste for adrenaline and for adventures, what makes her father worried as well her best girl friend. One day,her father promises Kocoum,a brave warrior from the tribe, that he will marry Pocahontas; she does not stay happy,specially because Kocoum is not a very charismatic guy. One day,walking in the forest with her two best animal friends Flit and Meeko,Pocahontas accidentally meets Jonh Smith.Capt. John Smith leads a rag-tag band of English sailors & soldiers to the New World to plunder its riches for Governor Ratcliffe. Smith and Pocahontas starts to have problems because of their different worlds, but spite that, they fall in love with each other. The only problem is the war that is starting both from the native Indians and the British, and they will need to show both worlds that they are equals and should live in peace.",Pocahontas

46,Sirus_the_Virus,An underrated animated film.,10,6 December 2009,"When I saw the rating for Pocahontas on IMDb, I said""Why?"" Pocahontas is a beautifully animated film. With beautiful songs. It's a story of true romance too. What Beauty and the beast was accept that movie was a little better. The songs in this movie are beautiful you'll never forget them. Pocahontas is the story of an Indian woman, named Pocahontas. She falls in love with a man named John Smith(voiced by Mel Gibson) when he and his men invade. Pocahontas and John Smith risk everything for each other.Pocahontas isn't the best of the animated features that have been released. It's not as good as Beauty and the beast. But it may be a little better than The lion king. Personally my favorite is The Aristorcats because it's hilarious in every way. But I think that the romantic ones have more to them. That is probably the thing that makes Pocahontas a special film.Pocahontas:****/****",Pocahontas
47,Beta_Gallinger,Probably the biggest letdown of all the animated Disney films I saw in my childhood,5,16 February 2008,"Being a big Disney fan as a kid, I saw this movie on the big screen during the summer of 1995, when I was just under nine years old. It had been a year since I had gone to see ""The Lion King"", an excellent film which I got a copy of on video shortly after it first came into stores. However, I was probably less impressed with ""Pocahontas"" than I had been with any other Disney film I had seen before. Because of that, I never saw it again until over a decade later, after rediscovering Disney. Unfortunately for me, I have found that the movie really isn't much different for me now than it was back when it was in theatres.In 1607, John Smith leads a crew from England to the ""New World"" in search for gold. Meanwhile, in the land where this crew is headed, Chief Powhatan wants his daughter, Pocahontas, to marry Kocoum, a great warrior who has just lead the tribe to victory in a battle. However, Pocahontas thinks Kocoum is too ""serious"", and does not wish to marry him. Lately, she has been having a recurring dream about a spinning arrow, and believes it means that change is about to come. Seeking advice, she goes and speaks to Grandmother Willow, a talking tree, who tells her to listen to her heart. Very soon, change does come when Smith and his crew arrive on western shores, near the village where Pocahontas and her tribe live! As unlikely as it may seem, when Pocahontas and John Smith meet, they soon fall in love, but since Pocahontas' tribe and Smith's crew both view each other as enemies, this relationship will be hard to keep! One problem I have with this mid-nineties Disney effort is that usually when I watch animated Disney films, both early and recent, I can expect some good humour, but not so with this one. There is quite a bit of attempted humour here, usually involving Meeko (Pocahontas' pet raccoon), Flit (a hummingbird), and eventually Percy (a spoiled dog owned by Governor Ratcliffe), but these gags rarely ever work at all. Personally, I think the funniest part is when Grandmother Willow scares two of the sailors off, which doesn't involve any one the three animal characters, but I think I can expect to find funnier gags than that in most of Disney's animated features. Aside from the lack of humour, the story seems pretty shallow at times, and seems like a rather simple commentary on racism. The songs in the film are probably not the worst bunch Disney has even done, but they've certainly done better. The most memorable song is probably ""Colours of the Wind"".Some may criticize ""Pocahontas"" for its historical inaccuracies, but in my opinion, that is certainly not its biggest problem. It have pointed out quite a few things that I think reduce the entertainment value significantly. Now, the film does have some reasonably suspenseful moments here and there, the relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith isn't too bad, and I can't complain about the animation, but apart from that, it really doesn't have much going for it. There are some Disney films that I don't like as much as I used to, but ""Pocahontas"" is the only one I can think of that I didn't seem to like much in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's a horrible movie that both kids and adults should avoid, but the fact that I didn't even think much of it in my childhood just might really say something.",Pocahontas
48,Stampsfightclub,One of the more mature Disney films,8,14 October 2008,"When Englishmen come to her land in search of gold, Pocahontas finds love in the arms of John Smith.This Oscar winning romantic drama from Walt Disney is one of the warmest and adult themed animations in the genre, and has a heart warming story and some beautifully crafted songs.The narrative centres around the beautiful independent Pocahontas, who we first see diving off a hill into a gorgeous river, and viewers are instantly thrust into her life as we see what's on her mind. Pocahontas is a great central character to have, as she embodies a very strong woman with her own mind. Her thoughts and feelings are well executed and are inspirational to women of all ages and is one of the strongest Disney characters ever created, right up there with Snow White.With ideologies of love and war, this is one of the most mature Disney pictures to date with plenty of adult themes and a strong sense of realism.The concept of love is excellently observed by director Mike Gabriel as we see the central character in many close shots, and a careful approach is used when she sees John Smith for the first time.The idea of loving the wrong person has been covered in many films before, and here Pocahontas falls in love with the enemy, a man who has come over with a group of men in search of gold and wish to take over her people's land. This battle of minds is also a fight over culture and humanity a very strong and issue driven drama which really makes you think come the end of the film.Slight disappointment as the narrative lacks at points and the ending feels rushed but thankfully isn't as daft as some other animations which rush into clichés.This film is also memorable for the fantastic soundtrack, and particularly the Oscar winning Colours of the Wind, which is the best part of the film by a mile, a really strong sentimental moment in the character's lives, and dives deep into the romantic genre and will make the weak at heart shed a tear or two.Not the most entertaining Disney, but the different approach and the strong adult focused themes of love and war are strong and engaging.",Pocahontas
49,Animany94,Definitely not their most exciting film.,5,16 February 2019,"The biggest problem with Pocahontas is that it's boring and predictable. How they managed to make a movie about colonialization and racism so boring is a mystery to me. And you can predict every step the movie takes from the romance to clash of the two parts and what triggers it.The character development is one of the big sinners here, because the main characters and the villain are either boring or stupid. Mel Gibson's performance as John Smith just sounded monotonous and detached and his romance with equally dull Pocahontas just felt forced. And yet there are not very much more to them than that romance. But the way they ended it all was pretty well done. The villain was the generic money hungry white man. Ratcliff had some pretty cringe-worthy lines which made him sound really stupid. His singing voice is good, but the lyrics to his song-sequences are either just generic (Mine Mine Mine) or over simplified serious topic (Savages).The animation is a highlight along with the songs. Colours of the Wind is an amazing song and delivers the most magic in the movie and Gibson's singing voice in Mine, Mine, Mine isn't half bad. But that is surface level aspects of a movie, and if a story isn't very engaging or exciting it ends up lackluster.The list goes on, because aside from a couple of beautiful songs and eye-popping animation, Pocahontas has remarkable problems which makes it fall into the category of wasted potential.",Pocahontas
50,ja_kitty_71,Disney's adaptation of the historical story of the Native Princess,10,22 May 2008,"Here is another underrated and also unappreciated classic from Disney, which became another favorite of mine. The film was based on the known facts of the historical story of the Indian princess Pocahontas and the folklore and legend that surround her. In particular, it presents a highly emotionally charged and dramatic account of the meeting between her and John Smith. This film is also the first Disney film to be based on a real historic character; although there are no suggestions in any of the historical records that Smith and Pocahontas were ever lovers, this romantic version of the story appears only in fictionalized versions of their relationship. But I do love Disney's take on them, and they had become one of my favorite Disney couples...though I don't want to change history.Admittedly speaking, I don't have a favorite scene, because I love the WHOLE film from beginning to end. And you know something isn't ironic that the gay servant actually knows why the natives attack the settlers.",Pocahontas

52,rebeljenn,"weak, inaccurate, dull",3,10 March 2006,"This Disney version of the story of Pocahontas is meant to be entertaining and fluffy rather than a realistic historical perspective. This story is about Pocahontas and her relationship with a white settler in American history and about trying to prevent battles between the native Americans and the new settlers. This film leaves little to be desired with its cast of annoying characters and a story and romance that is difficult to really get into and appreciate. Instead of being a hero, it seemed as if Pocahontas was reduced more to a romantic love interest. Very weak film; the story of Pocahontas could have been done much better than this.",Pocahontas
53,Mightyzebra,This film is my favourite Disney - it is so beautiful and exciting!,10,17 February 2007,"Genre: Animated film based on the real life of Pochahontas. Set in America with Native Americans.Personally, I don't see how this movie could have so many bad reviews. It is BEAUTIFUL AND EXCITING PLUS MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!This film is about a Native American woman called (obviously) Pochahontas. She watches English people arrive in America to take over. She meets one Englishman called John Smith. Can Pochahontas teach John how to respect the earth and not help take over (Sorry, you have to watch to find out, I won't keep you posted)?I absolutely love this film for five main reasons. Reason 1: I love all the characters, even the main baddie - he has a good voice etc. My three favourite characters are Pochahontas, John Smith and Meeko (I am one of their biggest fans). Reason 2: This film is based on real life. It is very interesting to watch the only Disney classic to be based on real life. Reason 3: I love the animation, drawings and backgrounds! They are beautiful and very life-like at times. Sometimes you feel very close to the Native Americans the animation is so good. Reason 4: I love all the songs, my favourite is ""Colours Of The Wind."" I also like ""Just Around The Riverbend"" (It's got my favourite quote: ""What I love about rivers is, you can't step in the same river twice. The water's always changing, always flowing.""). Reason 5: It isn't funny, yet it isn't serious either. It has jokes dropped in at appropriate times, which I like.So watch this movie, you're guaranteed NOT to dislike it!! :) ;) :()",Pocahontas
54,ersinkdotcom,"""Pocahontas / Pocahontas II"" explores more from the 1990s animated Disney Renaissance",7,4 September 2012,"""Pocahontas"" shows us how the young Native American Princess meets Englishman John Smith. The two engage in a romantic relationship which brings to mind Romeo and Juliet. Her Indian tribe and his group of settlers clash over the land with tragic consequences. This was the first Disney movie based on an actual historical figure. It does a great job of keeping true to the spirit of the actual incidences it's based on. That's not to say it doesn't stray away from fact or embellish a bit to keep things interesting and family friendly. There are messages of racial equality and environmental preservation throughout the film as well. What would a Disney movie from the 1990s be without social commentary? John Smith leaving Pocahontas behind at the end of this movie didn't give me a sense of ""Happily Ever After"" I expect from these types of movies. This movie is different from most of the Princess animated features like ""Cinderella,"" ""Snow White,"" or ""Beauty and the Beast."" Instead of waiting for Prince Charming to come along, Pocahontas takes matters into her own hands. Many females will embrace the concept and identify with the message of the movie.",Pocahontas
55,sethn172,Good history!!!!!,10,4 September 2006,"Disney made this film in 1995. It's called ""Pocahontas,"" and it's an animated film!!!!! This movie took place back in the days of early Colonial America. Some of the characters of this film have included John Smith, and, well, the lady Indian Pocahontas!!!!! You may have learned about this from the history books!!!!!What I liked about this film: It was a very serious film; not as good as the other films, but still good and memorable. This movie had taught us lessons, whether they were morals or just interesting educational facts from American History. I remember seeing this film twice back in 1995, and I thought that it was impressive.""Pocahontas"" is a very good film that peers us back in time to the days of pre-American times.

56,Min111,She's a well-known Disney character,10,17 December 2019,"I found it to be a very interesting Disney movie. It's one of my favourite Disney movies. I still, however, actually think movies such as 'Hercules', 'Mulan' and 'Tarzan' are better movies to watch than Pocahontas. They're all similar. I like them all.But what I do like about Pocahontas is the villain - Governor Ratcliffe. This is a villain which actually frightens me compared to other Disney villains. Not just the way it looks, but the way it acts too. He's very intimidating, especially the things he does. For Governor Ratcliffe, it's all business, but he hates it when someone interferes. The great thing about Governor Ratcliffe is the way it appears compared to other Disney villains. He looks very scary; in fact, I like the way he looks. He's very tall and obese. He looks round. Governor Ratcliffe is one of the more 'underrated' villains within the Disney universe.That's the only reason why I think 'Pocahontas' succeeded. A good villain makes such a difference. That's why I think that there is a 'small' or 'large' number of people that are massive fans of the movie. You could sort of understand that considering the title given for this movie, and the actual history surrounding 'Pocahontas'. I like her name by the way. 'Pocahontas' is such a beautiful Disney character. Let's not forget another character called John Smith. I like his name. It's common. It's an English name. He happens to be English. He's an explorer. He's handsome! John Smith is a good and nice guy. He happens to love 'Pocahontas'. Does she love him back? You need to see it to find out.'Pocahontas' doesn't end here. It continues further into its new adventure called 'Journey to the New World'. You should check the sequel out if you've already seen 'Pocahontas'.",Pocahontas
57,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,24 January 2021,"It is interesting the detail that ""Pocahontas"" was produced by the main team of Disney animators at the same time that ""The Lion King"" was being made by team B, in the end ""The Lion King"" becomes the greatest animation of all time in as ""Pocahontas"" is just a common Disney design. This does not mean that ""Pocahontas"" is bad, on the contrary, it is very good, but something is missing here that is left over from other titles in the same studio. The 90's were marked by the best Disney animations: ""The Lion King"", ""Mulan"", ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", among others ... All beautiful, with great stories, remarkable and unforgettable music, and lots of magic! This magic is lacking in ""Pocahontas"", for example: the soundtrack is beautiful, but not as much as that of the other films. The plot does not seem to fit, the film has a serious problem of rhythm, it drags on too much and when it seems to go forward, it is very fast and it ends. This coupled with a few other factors makes the film look a little ""unsalted"". However, ""Pocahontas"" is very rich, has a beautiful history and deals with strong and current themes such as racism, but it does it in a weak way. The protagonist couple is unsympathetic, the little animals are irritating and the villain is one-dimensional, all of which contributes to a certain lack of interest. The impression it gives is that of a very good idea but poorly executed, or done without will, perhaps a little more whimsy would deliver another memorable Disney work. I know it looks like I hate the movie, but that's not it! Pocahontas is great and a lot of fun. It's just a shame that it is the weakest among so many other striking titles from the studio at the time of its release!",Pocahontas

In the movie Captain John Smith (Mel Gibson) sails to the New World of Jamestown Virginia with a group of settlers and falls in love with Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) but the settlers led by Govenor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) and the Native Americans led by Pocahontas' father Chief Powatahn (Russell Means) wish to fight each other to protect eachothers' land so it's up to Pocahontas and her forest friends Meeko, Grandmother Willow, and Flit and John Smith and his dog Percy to bring peace between their people! The music is very wonderful written by Alan Menken and Steven Schwartz. Colors of the WInd always blows me away every time I hear Pocahontas sing it! My favorite scenes in the movie were when Meeko jumps into Percy's bath and eats all his cherries and Percy chases him and I also liked it when settlers Ben and Lon (Billy Connolly and Joe Baker) come into the forest looking for Smith and get scared away by Grandmother Willow. I just died laughing at those scenes! Disney did a fantastic job telling the story of Pocahontas through animation!

Someone wanted to say that they were a 55 year old cunning military man. He even had his own song (which called the natives savages). That was too hard to watch. I took my best lucky charm from my pocked and let it drop to the floor. Then Pocahontas climbed a tree and screamed like an eagle. The Military sergeant drives up in a ford f150 and peers up into the tree with a pair of binoculars (sees her strong face). Do you want to go to dennys for a coffee,' he yells.

I remember every Disney movie I have ever seen. There's always something memorable in every single one. Pocahontas (and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""!!!) are like a bad Robert Zemeckis movie.

62,TaylorYee94,Way underrated Disney,8,27 November 2020,"To all the haters who criticize this movie for being inaccurate. If you want the facts, watch the documentary or read history books. 'Pocahontas' got the inspiration from historical figures but the movie is made with imagination and creativity, telling the love story and morals that the difference does not define the inferiority. The producers or the director never claims that 'Pocahontas' is based on what really happened to Pocahontas or Rebecca Rolfe.I praise that it is made with such respect toward nature and the natives. Nature is beautifully portrayed with surprising animation quality, and it is a pleasure to watch long shots with lots of greenery. It personifies the tree as a Grandmother Willow who gives wise guidance. The director compares Pocahontas' life to nature such as river, wind, or tree. Life can be unknown and different from different angles like river. Life takes people to right places and flows like wind. Life is grounded deeply and connected to each other like trees.This movie also does justice to Native Americans. It questions how they are described in the literature or in the history. They have been called savages just because they are different, and not many movie states that they were the victims of conquerors. It also brings light to the economic difficulties and infringe on their rights at present time.This film is so much more than a love story. It contains deeper message and philosophy of how we look at the nature and the differences in the society.P. S I LOVE the fact that Pocahontas choses to stay for her people instead of leaving with her love. The ending is more realistic, dramatic, and powerful.",Pocahontas

I think Disney got to cocky with beauty and the beast and then the lion king and they wanted this to be an epic film and it overall just end up being ok. I found the plot to be the weakest link maybe if this film was made now in 2021 it could of been better but in the 90's they made it so blah.

68,Stompgal_87,Not only a childhood favourite of mine but also my sister's favourite Disney film with good music and beautiful animation,9,24 May 2014,"I remember seeing this in the cinema with my mother and my sister when we visited my grandparents in London back in 1995 when I was eight and my sister was four going on five. While I enjoyed this film for the most part as a child, I didn't like the ending because I was worried that John Smith was going to die and I remember telling my late grandmother how sad the ending was. Last Christmas I was trying to work out what the favourite Disney films of mine and my relatives were and while my top three are 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Oliver and Company' and 'Peter Pan' (this would probably be in my top ten), my mum's favourite is 'The Little Mermaid (in spite of me thinking her favourite was 'Beauty and the Beast')' and as per the summary of this review, my sister's favourite is this one despite me mistaking it was 'Cinderella.' This week, I re-visited this film twice; once with my mother when she recorded it from Channel 5 (although I only watched it from 'Colours of the Wind,' one of the best songs here, on that occasion) and today whilst renting the DVD. When finishing the viewing of this film, it was as good as I remembered albeit some forgettable scenes and songs due to not having seen this for a while.The best aspects of this film are its animation and music. The animation is up to Disney's usual standards with the character designs of the native Americans being completely different from those of the English settlers in this film and any other Disney Renaissance film character; picturesque backgrounds; and some beautiful, warm uses of colour, particularly the leaves that blow around Pocahontas and the sunrise/sunset scenes. As for the music, most of the songs are more memorable than the incidental music. Not only did I like 'Colours of the Wind' but also 'Just Around the River Bend,' 'Mine, Mine, Mine,' 'Steady as the Beating Drum' and 'Savages,' which are also good. While the incidental music was initially forgettable, it had its moments of charm, beauty and tension and I liked the instrumental reprise of 'Colours of the Wind' towards the end. I have just learnt that the song 'If I Never Knew You' was not featured in the original theatrical release of this film but it is lovely nonetheless. The film ran at a fast pace throughout and while a lot of people say the story is historically inaccurate in parts, it is still engaging and carries some valuable messages about cultural diversity and choosing one's own path, although the scene where Pocahontas and John Smith introduced each other didn't go anywhere. I also liked the opening and closing shots looking like sepia tone sketches, which was a new and different way to depict them instead of using the traditional storybook method. Pocahontas and John Smith are both kind-hearted characters, Nakoma, Kocoum and Powhatan are supportive, Grandmother Willow is gentle and encouraging, John Ratcliffe is gluttonous and menacing while Percy, Meeko and Flit are all cute and comical. The voice acting is very good, although I wasn't sure if Mel Gibson as John Smith was meant to sound British or American but I liked Billy Connoly's voice for Ben, David Ogden Stiers as Ratcliffe and Irene Bedard, while not one of the world's best-known voice actresses, as Pocahontas as well as Judy Khun providing her singing voice.To conclude, this is one of Disney's most unique films with a heartfelt story, a good soundtrack on the whole and a valuable message. 9/10.",Pocahontas
69,kikiboo_8,The ending ruins the otherwise amazing movie,8,28 November 2020,"It's better than most other Disney romance stuff, it has plot, dialogue, their relationship develops bit by bit and has a foundation. Unlike in others where it's love at first sight, then lollipops, unicorns and rainbows.
However, another way it differs from others is the lame ending.
They didn't end up together, even though they had managed to beat all the odds up until the very end, where the only thing that tore them apart was Pocahontas' choice to stay with her people.
Now, as Idealistic as I am by nature, I know that sad endings may sometimes reflect reality and all that stuff.
However, in this particular ending, it was really stupid and disappointing. Why would she let the love of her life float away like it's no big deal? I mean her people wouldn't need her forever and she'd eventually have to think of her own life and her own happiness rather than about what's the best for everyone else, right.
Besides, after all their differences were gradually resolved throughout the movie and even her people and her father started accepting him, she still chose not to be with him. It's sad.
After going through so much and attaining the seemingly impossible peace between the two peoples it ends like this.
Perhaps the director thought that it'd be far too nice and dreamy to let the viewers see a full on happy ending here? I wonder why, considering that it hasn't taken these kind of things as issues in the other movies.
I really loved this movie, much more than I ever thought I would or could. But this ending ruined it all, so 8 stars will have to do.",Pocahontas
70,robert-710-767167,"Interesting concept, but meh with story",6,3 February 2012,"I tend to dislike movies that focus on things like how humans are evil because they are destroying the environment or how we shouldn't have found America and got rid of the Indians, or how religion is terrible because God doesn't care about poor people.These movies tend to portray things in a way that I feel is wrong. In this case, it is about the Indians and how some British guys invaded and tried to attack their homes. The lovers seemed to fall in love too quickly, especially after John said that the Indians were savages.I could see the Romeo and Juliet story with two people on either side who fall in love. Which this was. However, I felt that they pushed the idea of white man = evil and have tried to make us wish we could leave them alone.I'm not saying that we aren't evil. We all do things we shouldn't, but the movie just doesn't seem to portray things in a fair way. But anyway, I'll rate this 6/10.",Pocahontas
71,kyle-cruse,Way underrated; the film is a masterpiece,8,9 August 2008,"I can't believe how many negative reviews this film has received. In reality, everything about the film is masterfully done. The animation is beautifully drawn and the characters are all full of life. For some reason, people feel that the film is racist, but on the contrary, it teaches that we need not look upon others as inferior or unimportant but that we should all live together and share the land. One of the things that really impressed me about this movie was the music. Although ""Colors of the Wind"" won the Oscar, ""If I Never Knew You"" is even better, in my opinion. Nevertheless, these are two of the best songs I've ever heard in a Disney movie. The interactions between the characters are perfectly done. Without giving away the ending, the film doesn't end perfectly happy, unlike most Disney films. Not that I don't love happy endings, but this keeps the reality of the story of Pocahontas more accurate, and Disney should be applauded for that. Maybe not everything is perfect about the movie, but it satisfied me and proved to be enjoyable and filled with emotion. If you've put off seeing this film, don't deprive yourself any longer. It's worth your time.***1/2 out of ****",Pocahontas

Of course, this is fiction, and not much is known about Pocahontas in any case. The movie does address some evils of the colonial enterprise - though, of course, while celebrating John Smith's romance with Pocahontas, just as white settlers did. Make of all that what you will: the animation is gorgeous, with nice portraits of Mid-Atlantic tidal ecosystems, and there are song excellent songs from Alan Menken. The romance is among the most interesting and equitable for Disney princesses (more so than The Little Mermaid or Aladdin, for example), and comes to an abrupt halt when Smith has to return to London for medical treatment; never mind that the historical Pocahontas did go to London! Anyway, even if not among the best of the Princess movies, it has become a Thanksgiving-time classic for our family.",Pocahontas
76,Dragoneyed363,"Is trashed by plenty, why?",10,19 August 2009,"WARNING: I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment.Out of every film that has ever been labeled Walt Disney ""classic"" or ""masterpiece"", this is the lowest rated one with a 5.9 rating, why? People think it's degrading and offensive to Native Americans, no, seriously, that's why this gem is so hated.Okay, people, it's a Walt Disney movie; Did you honestly think it was going to be 100% accurate and meant to reach out to full grown adults? Actually, it's not degrading or offensive one bit. It's actually really beautiful and touching. The song ""Colors of the Wind"" is one of the most beautiful and heartfelt songs that has ever been released in a Disney movie. The characters are top notch and the, what most think is crappy, animation, I think, is wonderful! Some things like Grandmother Willow telling her to follow her heart and that Pocahontas is able to overcome the barriers of race to find love are such powerful messages that were so great seeing in this.As one comment says, ""When Pocahontas originally came out, Disney's wave of recent hits came to a crashing halt. The film was labeled as racist or at least insensitive to Native Americans and the goodwill that Disney had established with its audiences quickly evaporated. You could say they have never been the same since"", which is very disappointing because this movie was not a scratch on Walt Disney's film records like most people think.I always love seeing Pocahontas rush to save the day and prove that any ""savage""'s violence and carnage, whether Native American or not, can be halted by the powers of love. While this film gets a very bad wrap, it's not anywhere near as horrible as everyone lets on. With beautiful songs, great animation and wonderful, powerful messages one after another, Pocahontas is Disney's most underrated and under-appreciated masterpiece by far. I always enjoy watching it and find myself getting chills at many of scenes; I have chills all through ""Colors of the Wind"", when she is running to stop the war and the final scene when she is standing on the rock and the leaves brush past her in the wind.Beautiful movie, a shame it wasn't considered a hit like most, and just overall gets very unfair treatment. Though it's no The Lion King, Aladdin or the numerous Disney classics before the 90's, it deserves just as much positive recognition which, like I've stated many times, it fails to get. I love it, and people who hate it need to open their eyes and see it for what a beautifully crafted and heartfelt story it really is...P.S. The extra song sang by Pocahontas and John Smith on the 10th anniversary DVD is too die for...",Pocahontas
77,sam_smithreview,"Love it or Hate it, it is one hell of a movie",9,27 April 2016,"I haven't watched Pocahontas in maybe ten years, but I was feeling nostalgic one day and popped it in. I could not believe how truly BEAUTIFUL this movie is, in every aspect. STORY: Dramatic (with it's humorous moments of course), romantic, and it carries a very important message of peace, maturity, and fighting against ignorance and prejudice from BOTH sides. This is possibly the Disney movie with the greatest message for kids.ANIMATION: Drop. Dead. Gorgeous. Every single frame is such wonderful eye candy, and the camera work serves the sweeping story line extremely well.MUSIC: Aside from the songs everyone knows (Just Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind) every single other song in the film is wonderful, with soaring harmonies and Broadway quality singing. Everything was masterfully written and executed. The music alone is reason enough for this to be adapted into a full out Broadway musical, but don't worry...the music is brilliant but it doesn't scream ""MUSICAL!"" like Hairspray or Mamma Mia.HISTORIC ACCURACY: Yes, Disney changed the true story quite a bit, but if you look to Disney for accurate re-telling's of historical events you have a serious PROBLEM. This movie is more 'Inspired by' than 'Based on' and since the true story is about a 13-14 year old falling in love with 30-40 year I think we can all appreciate that they took some liberties with a KIDS' MOVIE.All in all, I really don't get why this isn't revered as a classic right along with The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.",Pocahontas
78,C22Man,The declining renaissance?,5,11 October 2015,"So after a run of successful films and a monster hit with The Lion King, it was up to Disney to keep the goods coming. Sadly Pocahontas didn't turn out as the crowd pleaser the studio hoped it would and it ended their hot streak by being something of a critical disappointment. It's not difficult to see why however. This was a very different take in a number of ways and dealt with actual historical events for the first time, so people were ready to scrutinise the film if need be. Credit must be given to the team behind it for taking such a risk at their peak and though it has its good points it definitely isn't up to the standard of its predecessors.I think most people are familiar with the story. A group of British settlers, amongst them is John Smith, come to new found land with dreams of finding gold and eliminating savages. Smith meets and bonds with one of the natives named Pocahontas, as they begin to see that both sides can get along and avoid bloodshed. Here is the issue I have with this story, it has been done to death. It's the typical white men invade the land, one realises his mistake and they all see that the inhabitants aren't savages. We've seen it numerous times before to the point where you know exactly what will happen, making it totally uninteresting. They needed to do something truly different or experimental for this story to be engaging, which they sadly don't.This could be salvaged if the characters are interesting, but they're not. Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) is as bland as they come. They try to make her adventurous and free-spirited, but she has no personality and just comes across as a bit of a moaner. John Smith (a monotone Mel Gibson) is equally as bland. I know he's meant to be a normal guy, it's just that he's a complete bore and does almost nothing of note throughout. If your main characters are like this then it's not a good sign. The natives are simply okay and a lot of Grandmother Willow's (Linda Hunt) dialogue seems very out of place. Thomas (a young Christian Bale) is likable enough and Ben is quite funny thanks to Billy Connolly, but there's a dearth of appealing characters.The villain is very weak too. Ratcliffe (Disney regular David Ogden Stiers) is another guy who is completely fuelled by greed and just wants gold. He has absolutely no character beyond that, he isn't funny or threatening and he's only there to provide a bit of conflict. Another issue I had was with the animal sidekicks. There were far too many 'cute' moments, where there's a bit of slapstick or they do something silly and it clashes badly with the relatively serious tone. Plus given the themes of nature I think the animals should talk and it would make sense, it's strange that a tree talks but the animals don't. The songs are pretty bland for the most part, not remotely memorable and there are a few too many that get in the way. Though I will say 'Colours of the Wind' is excellent.You might think I hate this film, but I don't and there are some very good areas. For one the animation is simply incredible. It is easily some of Disney's best ever. I'm not sure what it is about the colours but they are so vibrant that they almost leap off the screen and the backgrounds are just beautiful to look at. Simple things such as the rivers and the trees are animated gorgeously, while there's lots of sky blues and pinks that create a lovely colour palette. It's clear that a lot of work was put into the visuals and it certainly pays off. The characters are drawn more to look like real people which is also nice. Alan Menken's score is very effective and sets a good mood when it appears. There's also a strong atmosphere at certain points, especially in the quieter scenes, that I wish ran through the whole film.Even though I don't think Pocahontas is a particularly good film, I can see why others do and it does have things to admire. I respect Disney for trying something very different to their usual work and I think the animation is a massive strong point. However it suffers in its two key areas, with a story that was already stale when it came out and with characters that it is almost impossible to get invested in. Not to that mention some of the decisions to take with the story are questionable and it is all over the place in regards to its take on history. It is very much a mixed bag, especially given Disney's successes at the time, but it's certainly an interesting addition.",Pocahontas

80,jaredpahl,Beautiful... In Every Sense of the Word,9,18 November 2015,"During the famed ""Disney Renaissance"", a period that started in 1989 with the release of The Little Mermaid and continued through the entire 1990s, Disney was creating modern classics with every film they released. In the midst of this revolution came Pocahontas, a rousing animated musical, directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg. Pocahontas is something of an outlier in the Disney cannon. It is not a cutesy, kid-centric fairy tale a la Disney classics like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or Beauty and the Beast. What Disney's 33rd animated feature is, is a sensational movie musical, and one of Disney's most technically accomplished works.Pocahontas, in typical Disney style, takes a well-known tale and molds it into an easy-to-digest story set to music. In this case, for the first time at Disney, the story is not entirely fictional. Here's where some people come down on Pocahontas. No, it didn't stay completely true to what really happened with John Smith and the real story of Pocahontas, but it would be a much lesser movie if it had. Pocahontas, the movie, is based on the legend of Pocahontas rather than the reality. The decision to romanticize the legend is a no-brainer. This is Disney after all. We expect strong archetypes and accessible drama.The story begins with English settlers setting off for Virginia. Their leader, Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) comes in search of gold, John Smith (Mel Gibson) comes for the adventure of a lifetime. Back on the New World is Pocahontas, a young Algonquin princess voiced by Irene Bedard, who is set to be married to the tribe's dashing bachelor, Kocoum. It's all very predictable Disney stuff. The settlers are mostly just boisterous, gold-lusting, brutes, The princess is weary of getting together with the jock character, and there's only one man who understands her. We've heard it before. Even so, the story is handled with care and the familiar elements are welcome for the most part. The unfamiliar elements, chief of which is a surprisingly mature and complex love story between John Smith and Pocahontas, are where Pocahontas' plot stands out from its Disney siblings. There is more to this film than surface layer romance. Complimenting the dramatic story of betrayal and acceptance is a poignant message about coexisting peacefully with each other and the world around us.The story is as moving as any other Disney classic, but what makes Pocahontas a notable Disney Renaissance landmark is its animation and music. Hand drawn animation had been around for a half century before Pocahontas, and stage musicals a hundred years before that. It's a wonder then, that somehow Pocahontas still manages to be a jaw-dropping example of both. I don't think the film gets the credit it deserves as one of Disney's best drawn films. The animators, led by the legendary Glen Keane, do things with animation that were game-changing, even by the high standard set by the world's leading animation studio. The character designs are expertly idealized, accentuating facial features and movement without ever crossing the line into cartoon. The backgrounds are even better. The untouched beauty of the American landscape is given scale, depth, and an expressionistic dynamism. It all comes together in the musical numbers. Music is always a matter of taste, but for me, every song down the line in Pocahontas worked in a big way. I honestly cannot think of another musical that can make that claim. Every musical, animated or otherwise, has at least one dud. It's a rule. Pocahontas breaks tradition. The rhythmic ""Just Around the Riverbend"", the wonderfully wicked ""Mine, Mine, Mine"", and the grand, Oscar-winning spectacle that is ""Colors of the Wind"" are all rousing, bombastic, and sweeping pieces of music. The songs are up to the quality of the very best Broadway musicals, and the animation only improves the numbers. The explosively vivid colors and spacious movement that go along with the songs are artistry of the highest kind.There is a surplus of talent and passion in every fiber of Pocahontas. When all the pieces come together, the story, the animation, and the music, Pocahontas is remarkable. It's a film of craftsmanship and quality. While kids will no doubt enjoy it, it's not made ""for"" kids. Like the best Disney movies, Pocahontas appeals to anyone who loves music and appreciates the warm touch of hand drawn animation. Add to the sights and sounds, some of which were enough to literally take my breath away from me, a timeless message of acceptance and stewardship of nature, and what you get is a classic, Disney or otherwise. Show this movie to your kids, watch it yourself, just see it. Pocahontas is in a word... Beautiful.92/100",Pocahontas
81,cnycitylady,"Pocahontas is a Visual, Musical and Heartfelt masterpiece",9,30 November 2012,"Pocahontas possibly got the worst reviews of any Disney Movie, and I for one don't know why. Yes it wasn't historically accurate but then again it was NOT supposed to be. It was a children's movie, meant for fun. Disney took a somewhat boring past and turned it into a magical journey for everyone to enjoy. Pocahontas had everything a good animated movie should have, it had the Heroine, a strong woman determined to do right for everyone, the Hero John Smith, a somewhat ignorant man who openly embraces change and information, eager to learn about other races and heritages. It had beautiful animation, the scenery was colorful enough to capture the kids' attention yet dull enough to help you be pulled into the story and not just become blind sighted with diverse coloring. The movie had an atypical villain, not necessarily Ratcliff himself but what he believed in, what his short sighted pre-programmed brain allowed him to see. He wasn't ""bad"" he was just uneducated and stubborn, trying to make a name for himself and going about it the wrong way. It showed the audiences that the ""bad guy"" is not always a physical entity, but the backward thinking of the past. The movie had beautiful musical sequences; ""Colors of the Wind"" may very well be within the top five Disney songs ever written for an animated feature. ""Just around the Riverbend"" and ""Savages"" were also a great deal of fun. Not to mention that on its 2005 DVD release of the film they integrated ""If I Never Knew You"" seamlessly into the movie, the lost love song between Pocahontas and John Smith, solidifying the romance that some might have thought dull upon the movies original release in 1995. The movie also teaches a lesson perhaps more relevant today than back when it was in theaters. It tells the world to live in sync with nature and to appreciate the beauty that it has to offer. In the end Pocahontas is a jewel of a movie, masterfully crafting history into one of the greatest musicals, love stories and lessons that man can receive. In this users opinion Pocahontas is one of Disney's greatest achievements and my personal favorite Disney movie.",Pocahontas
82,datautisticgamer-74853,Inaccuracies are not the problem I have here,6,3 May 2016,"I took no issue with the historical inaccuracies in the case of Pocahontas, since they only affected the characters themselves instead of what they do throughout the film (looking at you, Robin Hood). But anyway, on to the rest. The songs are beautiful (if the lyrics aren't exactly memorable, but you will remember how pristine or provocative they sound, namely Colors of the Wind vs. Savages), the animation is dazzling, and some of the characters can keep the movie fueled outside of song. There are still a load of dull moments, though, and the humor doesn't work. While I found it to be a tad more enjoyable than some of Disney's older movies, there wasn't enough to keep me in some way engaged. This also happened with The AristoCats, though that one I ranked higher since it tried more to re-engage me and was overall more successful. Pocahontas is just another mixed bag of a Disney film that you should give yourself reasonable debate over before seeing it. Don't worry, however, since later, we would get a more important ""Disney"" film.",Pocahontas

It dosen't really stay true, but it was good.I did have a few problems with this movie is that the character's, Governor Ratcliffe and Kocoum, were one-dimensional. Governor Ratcliffe is just greedy throughout the film. But I did like his song. For Kocoum, just like what Pocahontas said in the movie, ""He's so...Serious"".Also, the film dosen't have that much comic relief. I know Disney was trying to make the film serious, but we could have had a couple comic relief scene's.

84,TheSeaLion,Lacks what made the other Disney movies good,3,16 April 2014,"Between the years of 1989 and 1999, the Walt Disney Animated Studios were in a period of a renaissance where they created a long line of well-received animated films. Starting in '89 with the release of ""The Little Mermaid"" and ending in '99 with the release of ""Tarzan"", this period for Disney saw the creation of some of Disney's most well-known and popular films to date. The track record with the Disney films during this time period was mostly positive, with some minor slip-ups like ""Hercules"", none of the films were, in general terms, bad movies. That is until Disney released its sixth renaissance film ""Pocahontas"" in 1995. ""Pocahontas"" is a prime example of a film that lacks focus or what made the other Disney films enjoyable.""Pocahontas""'s major flaw to it is that the film loses its focus from time to time, jumping to slapstick routines between a raccoon, hummingbird, and a dog for comic relief. The other Disney films had comic relief as well, whether Timone and Pumba from ""The Lion King"" or Mushu from ""Mulan"", but their comedic contribution to the film can be worked into the story to give an idea of their characters or deliver comedic relief. In ""Pocahontas"", time is taken out of the movie just for the trio of animal's slapstick routine that adds nothing to the story or develops their characters. The film also lacks the fun and energy that the other Disney films had, making this film unmemorable. Both Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) and John Smith (Mel Gibson), lack any characterization and are the most generic and boring Disney characters I've ever seen put on screen. The villain of the film, Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) not only does not match up to the line of villains Disney has, but he is not a good villain in general. The other villains like Scar (Jeremy Irons), Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer), or Hades (James Wood) all had something that made them memorable, whether Scar's sinister planning, Hades' comedic charm, or the fear affiliated with Shan-Yu. Ratcliffe has no discernible personality or charm to his character and just elicits laughter towards him because of how poorly he is portrayed as a villain.One thing Disney is most famous for is the songs created for its films. Songs from their films, like the films themselves, are some of the most well-known songs ever to be written for movies, from ""Lion King""'s 'Hakuna Matata' to ""Mulan""'s 'I'll Make a Man Out of You', they are songs that anyone who's seen the movie remember. Even if the majority of the songs in the movie are forgettable, there is usually at least one memorable song. With ""Pocahontas"", this is sort of the case, it has a slightly memorable song, but does not stand out much when compared to the other Disney songs.""Pocahontas"" is a film that lacks focus and all of the elements that made the other Disney films good. Every other Disney film in the renaissance period had something memorable about it, whether a character or a song, which ""Pocahontas"" does not have. It relies too much on the slapstick routine of a raccoon, hummingbird, and dog for comedic relief which takes away from the film, and its characters are bland and forgettable. In short, ""Pocahontas"" is the worst film from the Disney Renaissance and possibly one of Disney's worst movies.",Pocahontas
85,tmpj,Not as bad as I expected....,5,8 May 2010,"Disney films such as ""The Hunchback"" and ""Pocahontas"" are films I did not want to watch because I already knew--or at least sensed--that the historical context was going to be bent somewhat out of shape. I have not yet seen the Hunchback, but Pocahontas is an attempt to put a new suit of clothes on an old story. An attempt was made by the writers to at least put on the table the differing points of view of the arrival of Whites from both perspectives...the conqueror and the soon to be vanquished. Though conflict in this instance was averted, the Natives were going to ultimately be the big losers and, as if that weren't enough, within several years of the date of this story--1607--Jamestown would become the point of entry for African slaves, brought over as cargo to till the soil and build the new land under the rule of cat-o-nine-tails. But, Pocahontas deals with only a small fraction of time. Despite my mis-givings, I have to say the story-line was not overly bad, and I was amazed at the excellent quality of the film score. However, one cannot help but feel sorry for the Natives because, with the invaders cast as guys that were not all that bad, the indigenous peoples have a hand in bringing about their own downfall by accepting those who had lust for the land and for its riches without regard to the lives and well being of those who were already on the land and who had been there for millenia. If one is able to get past the facts, they may be able to get some enjoyment from this film. And I can only recommend this film to those who can cast aside their feelings for a time in order to watch it.",Pocahontas
86,quiqueperezsoler,"Pioneering for Disney's cultural diversity, an animation wonder with still relevant messages today. Not historically accurate but it never meant to be.",8,1 May 2020,"A mesmerizing spectacle of colors, contrasting cultures, music and absurdly-well animated characters. While not historically accurate, at the time it meant Disney was finally focusing on making more culturally diversed movies with an almost pitch-perfect tale of two people from different worlds who when meeting opened their hearts and had an eye-opening realisation: that they weren't so different after all.While those who criticise this movie would do so by comparing the historical accuracy of the historical figures these characters are meant to portray, need I remind them that it is a loose adaptation of the story in the same way Disney has adapted every single film ever since they began making them.There are tons of documentaries faithful to the story and tons of books that can be researched for a more historically accurate depiction of the characters. Animated movies have thrived on using colors to emote, nature-based symbolism and many child-friendly ""gimmicks"" for the younger audiences to provide engaging and heartfelt stories that would speak not only to them but adults too. Even if the age of Pocahontas was different and she wasn't ""over-sexualized"" as some have put it, would it still be okay for them to see her with 3 animal friends, a grandma willow tree that talks and the incredibly mesmerizing colors of the wind?Surely, some of the logistics of the story may be hard to grasp at first, for instance how would two different cultures communicate in the same language, but just like Disney gave voices to animals in many of their movies in order to make it more accesible to children especially, here a sequence was dedicated to sort of ""explain"" how would they actually communicate. And so goes for other elements that might seem ilogical, the movie is not trying to be a perfect depiction of native americans and the arrival of english men to their shores, it is a tale that serves as a vessel for an important message involving interracial interactions and acceptance of what is different and unknown to us.All in all, many animated movies, and especially Disney, have never been known to have the most accurate adaptations to the source material. Granted, it might be wrong to use well-known historical figures or fictional characters and stories to tell a tale that would otherwise also function and have the same impact if the main character wasn't called Pocahontas, but it's not like Disney is known for that. So for those who complain about this sort of thing, I might as well tell you that I'm personally a big Spider-Man fan and to this day there hasn't been a non-animated faithful adaptation of the source material but that didn't take away from the gratification of seing its essence captured in the ones that were made.IN CONCLUSION, don't judge a book by its cover, this movie is well-paced, well written and acted, the animation is so engaging and hypnotic it still holds today and the themes from the symbolism of the arrow to the non-conflict-but-deep-resolution conclusion is original and impactful. The movie is meant to be taken lightly as some aspects are glanced over and most pieces fall into place in many occasions, but the songs are not forced and enhance the message it tries to send, the characters feel real and I just can't get over the little gestures and mannerisms in the animation of the characters. It is a classic of animation and a trully well-crafted movie.",Pocahontas
87,Cylex,Meeko is the real star of this film.,5,25 November 2001,I only found this film watchable when Meeko was in shot. Without him I would have been bored stiff. I fear animation is beginning to push out the cute characters and that's a shame. I hated Flit though who kept picking on Meeko. I liked Percy better after a second viewing. The best song was Colours of the Wind but the rest ranged from fair to awful. The romance between Pocahontas and John Smith did not fit. I was glad the film ended the way it did. I'm not bothered by historical accuracy since films are not documentaries and Disney has done worse to fiction. (Notre Dame de Paris for example) For including Meeko I rate this 5 Without him it would be 2,Pocahontas
88,sherilcarey,Hard core hate from a true Disney fan,1,30 January 2019,"Yes, hate is a strong word but to whatever extent hate can apply to a film I hate Disney's Pocahontas. I like a lot of Disney including quite a few that seem to get complained about more than raved over. But there are 2 that stand out to me as truly terrible films, films bad enough to begrudge the time spent watching them, and this was the first in that sad little category.First let me say that I'm a history lover and I've always really loved the true story of Pocahontas as I've known it since I was a very young child. And I'm happy learning corrections to that story sometimes as new evidence is presented over time. Those who want to blow that off and pretend that movies (or children's movies or Disney movies) can't portray history and be good movies or that people who want to see history not turned into a sewage by Disney have something wrong with them and need to just get over it are not helping matters with their strawmen and their useless and foolish insults.This is not about a few mild inconsistencies or poetic license. This film is so wrong in so many ways that to say that they pirated the names of historical figures and made up bald face lies about them while diligently working to not accidentally say much of anything true about them would seem closer to the reality of the movie than any other description I can think of. There is truly no justification or rational that can work for how hard Disney worked to cover over the history with falseness.And although they really try to portray Pocahontas and her people as better and the ""white people"" as wrong and bigoted they still manage to portray mostly only lies about Pocahantas and her people thus robbing them of their dignity and the related beauty that exists and is easily conveyed in the true history. Historically there were flaws and virtues in all the real characters. They were all humans. And they could have all been treated respectfully by any storyteller who saw at least a small part of the real value in this little episode of history.This movie was abysmal when my kids were young. Now that I have rewatched it just once from being a somewhat mellowed out grandma who thought maybe it's not as bad as I remember ...well it just reignited the heat of my initial anger at Disney for robbing the real Pocahontas. Her true story is both beautiful and tragic. It deserves to be told. I hope all those cursed with having seen this steaming pile of lies later get the chance to experience some of the essence of the real Pocahontas from more worthy storytellers.",Pocahontas
89,xsophietaylorx,Spiritual,8,12 October 2014,"I find that Pocahontas is a very spiritual down to earth film it's so light and lovely to watch it really is eye opening to the stubbornness off people and how we can loose our way in the modern world. The film is gorgeous and done really nicely, it is roughly based on truth which is interesting and factual apart from that the music in the film really was grand, colours of the wind is one of those gem of a songs that is almost a guilty pleasure to listen to. Strangely the cast has many a famous face with the likes of Thomas being voiced by Christian Bale (Batman) and John Smith being voiced by Mel Gibson (Braveheart) I think that goes to show that this film isn't really off a poor quality. Weirdest off all the film all though cartoon isn't very much a Disney princess type off child appealing film but I remember watching Pocahontas as a child and loving it especially Meeko the raccoon all though he doesn't say a weird he had me in stitches. I think this film is worth the watch",Pocahontas
90,cartesianthought,Love and happiness versus pride and violence.,7,24 December 2015,"The Native Americans were portrayed inaccurately, but when did anyone care about history and politics in a Disney movie. Something is endearing about the character of Pocahontas, who prefers levity over rules and traditions. She always takes the more challenging and interesting path as opposed to her more old-fashioned parents. This of course leads us to the tree of wisdom which guides Pocahontas and the climax in this movie when she creates a ceasefire is a standout moment. It does heavily follow the formula that The Little Mermaid started and it lacks a memorable villain, but it's a solid entry in the Disney universe nonetheless.",Pocahontas

It was so easy to take a brave attempt at broadening an art and chop it down because it is not a documentary on the subject, or because it dares inject a bit of magic, whimsy, and humor into a ""True Story"".As the filmmakers stated from the beginning, this was intended to be a dramatization of the LEGEND of the ROMANCE between Pocahontas and John Smith. NEVER was it intended to be a 100% accurate documentation of the Historical events that happened (or MAY have happened) in the earliest days of ""Jamestown"".What was attempted, and what was achieved in rapturous beauty, was the most naturalistic and richly detailed Animated interpretation of nature, human figures, and a multi dimensional star crossed romance that rings true Emotionally if not historically.I very much hope that anyone interested in the art of animation will take another look, or see the superb 10th anniversary edition...which gives the lead characters the love theme that they were so rudely denied.This is a breathtaking, intelligent film that stands up well against the sublime ""The New World"" (another, even LESS appreciated film treatise of the Pocahontas tale...that was largely overlooked in 2005).It is to be treasured for it's superb songs, bewitching beauty, and unappreciated insights into Native American culture....and for being the most Dazzling Animated Film this side of ""Fantasia"".I am writing this as the Re-birth of Disney ""traditional"" ""Line Drawn"" animation is marked by the release of ""Enchanted"".It would be so wonderful to celebrate by acknowledging this film as the ultimate peak reached by the art (so far!!).",Pocahontas

The animation is in style of Atlantis and Home on the Range. There are some funny sidekick moments to lift up the heavy tone and some songs like Colors of the Wind that became a hit thanks to the teaser in TLK. But the 1990s had many cartoons loosing at the Box Office like Pocahontas. Grown men will love Pocahontas too as there are a lot of action, so find this on DVD ot VHS at the markets. No TLK hit, but a close cigar.",Pocahontas
94,bblack1-699-968577,Paint with All the Colors of the Wind,5,16 June 2014,"This is the movie, as a lot of you know, that many people said began the downward spiral of Walt Disney animated films...And I'd be lying if I said I don't see why. But, on the other hand, there are some really good things in this movie that I think are really underrated.ANIMATION: This might be one of Disney's best looking movies. It should be, a film that is celebrating nature and becoming one with all creations of the Earth should have some good visuals; only these aren't good visuals - they're great! You never see the outlines on anyone or anything. The colors work really well together, and the style of how everything blends is great! I love watching the animation during the ""Savages"" number; isn't that what you'd expect to see from Disney?SONGS/MUSIC: Obviously the songs are some of the best things in this movie. Here we get Alan Menken back, along with lyricist Stephen Sondheim. We all know and love ""Colors of the Wind,"" which, again, is great to both watch and listen to. The lyrics and singer are great, but listen to the music in that song! The orchestrations are great! I mentioned ""Savages"" before, and that's a great antagonist song! I don't know if I'd call it a villain song. Radcliffe does manipulate the people to get what he wants, but everyone on both sides of the battlefield hate each other. The antagonist here is hate, and it's displayed perfectly in this song. I watched this movie recently and was reminded of the song ""Just Around the Riverbed."" It's nice, I guess. Again, the orchestrations are really good.ROMANCE: The more I think about it, I really like the romance in this movie between Pocahontas and John Smith. It stems from something. You can see how they began falling in love with each other. Usually it's so easy for Disney characters to just meet and fall in love. Here, however, they spend time together. They talk, they learn about each other and their differences. I like that they're not working to fall in love, that's not why they're together. They are initially learning from the other person, and they fall in love in due time.CHARACTERS: These aren't the most memorable characters, but they're not bad...not all of them, anyway. I find the animals annoying...Actually I only find the hummingbird and dog annoying when they're with the raccoon, so maybe it's just him. The other characters are OK, but what really surprised me was my interest in Pocahontas' character. If you read my review for ""The Little Mermaid,"" you may be thinking, ""You panned Ariel for rebelling! Why do you like Pocahontas?"" Here's the thing: the first time Pocahontas' father told the village to stay away from the White men, Pocahontas was already with John Smith, so she technically didn't disobey that time. After that, though, her rebellion actually brought peace and harmony between two different groups of people. And her rebellion wasn't due to selfish ambition. It began with her curiosity of these different people, which led her to ask the question ""Why are we segregated?"" She was trying to put a stop to the war and discrimination between them. That's not only selfless, but also brave and responsible! And, yes, her actions did get someone killed, but imagine how many more people would have died if the war she tried to stop had taken place. Ariel? So long as she gets her Prince, what the crud does she care what happens? Pocahontas is a great character and role model!STORY: I think this is what people take issue with the most. The story is old and boring - we've seen it too many times. This film isn't doing anything new or exciting with the tale of greedy White men conquering the Red people's land, so it's not that interesting. We know that tale, we know the story of Pocahontas, and we know what Disney's going to do to make us smile and live happily ever after. There aren't any surprises or nuances, so it doesn't really matter. There are only two things that shocked me...and they were stupid things. First of all, a tree can talk. What? Second of all, did you see the change in how Pocahontas could suddenly understand and communicate with John Smith? How does that work? How is it possible? You can't take a story about a real person and real events and mix it with fairy tale! The ending was changed, but that's something we can at least say is possible; we can go along with that because people can do that in reality. What ISN'T possible in reality is speaking in another language just because the leaves blow, or having your grandmother be a tree! What the crud!? CONCLUSION: While the story doesn't grab me and most of the characters are bland and unforgettable, the animation, music, romance, and our main character are enough to keep me coming back and watching this movie all over again! Give Disney credit, delivering this message isn't as easy as one may think it is. In fact, kudos to Disney for doing it period, especially with the characters in this movie. I think this is supposed to make up for the racist Indians we got in ""Peter Pan."" If you love or like this film, I understand. If you don't like it, again I understand. Bottom line, hopefully we can acknowledge both the strengths and weaknesses of the movie. Surly we can all ""paint with all the colors of the wind."" BOOYIKA!",Pocahontas

While not having such immense impact as the two previous Disney animations, ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"", ""Pocahontas"" still provokes the mind and questions how and why the Natives where mistreated by the settlers. A quick answer would be the times when those events occurred, but that will never excuse the actions themselves.As with any Disney animated feature film, the songs are what everyone should be looking for, and ""Pocahontas"" delivers with a beautiful original soundtrack, winning two Academy awards, one for the everlasting song ""Colors of the Wind"".""Pocahontas"" is a good Disney movie, but it will not make the top ten list.",Pocahontas

If you expects a historical lesson, you are on the wrong movie. If you expects a film similar to ""Aladdin"" or ""The Lion King"", you'll be disappointed. But if you are gonna take this movie for what it is, you'll experience an enchanting and magical film, although it has some flaws that doesn't make it reach higher.""Pocahontas"" is the Disney flick many loves to hate. Once I understood the hatred. Ironically, I loved this movie after seeing it for the first time on the theater, but during the years every view of this film became variable. Now I truly appreciate this movie, although - again - it has some flaws, which unfortunately mess up what could otherwise be an masterpiece.But lets talk about it later.""Pocahontas"" is, actually, a very lively and vibrating film, with many fast camera swoops (resembling Mike Gabriel previous and underrated film, ""Rescuers Down Under""). The animation is stunningly beautiful. The colors of art director Mike Giamo are rare and special. The filmmakers have succeed to make the forest an enchanting place.""Pocahontas"" is also a more moody film, accompanied with Alan Menken's most beautiful and complex score made for an Disney film (is it just me, or does this score resembles the ""Beauty and the Beast"" score?).The songs are successful too, personally I liked them all, except ""The Virginia Company"", which didn't gave me anything. Otherwise, each song is enchanting and fills the story on its own merits (although ""Savages"" does have very hard hitting lyrics).The characters are drawn in a more angular way and it's obvious that the animators had many live action reference during making the expression of the human characters faces, which resembles real people. The Indians are presented in a very authentic way (by giving them Indian words), which are something to give ""Pocahontas"" a more authentic and mature feeling.Pocahontas herself is beautiful and wise, but she may be to complex for children to relate to. John Smith is an likable guy, although Mel Gibson's voice feels stoic. I liked Meeko, Ben, Lon and Thomas, the other characters were dull and boring (especially the uncharismatic Nakoma). I used to like Grandmother Willow, but now I find her a little annoying, actually. While most of the voice actors performs well, Russell Means (Chief Powhatan) really stands out, along with Billy Connolly (Ben) and Joe Baker (Lon). The film is preachy, yes, but I liked the message, cause it's actually a good and important one; taking care of the nature and each other. I usually like Disney climax scenes, but I confess that in 1995 I found it refreshing that Disney tried something new with not having a big battle at the end (although I still wonder how the film would be then).But now I'm gonna mention the flaws: ""Pocahontas"" stood out to be different from is Disney predecessors for having more serious story - and this film is one of Disney's most serious, with an almost bitter tone. I think this film fits more to the adults than the kids, referring to the complexity of the love story and the mature feeling of the film.That case of Ratcliffe being a weak villain isn't one of the worst issues (for me). More worse is the script, who's straightforward and narrow. The film wants to be a drama, but feels rather bitter than actually dramatic. When the tension between the settlers and the natives speeds up, there's not much to light up the mood and that makes ""Pocahontas"" more heavy-handed.The speechless animals stands for the comedy, but I still think the directors should had overview the movie before releasing it, cause there are some parts where the comedy doesn't fit. Of the animals I liked only Meeko, Percy and Flit were uncharismatic. I saw ""The Lion King"" three times and ""Pocahontas"" twice at theaters and the audience laughed most during ""Pocahontas"".Another weak part is, actually, the ending. Not because the lovers don't get together, no, practically because the only unhappy Disney-ending feels forced, rushed and out of context. It seem stupid that Smith would randomly be wounded by Ratcliffe, for then be send back to England and would probably die during the trip. And Pocahontas actually had the chance to go with him. I wish that Disney would stick to their original ending, where Nakoma explains Poca why she shouldn't leave and where they're singing the final words of ""If I Never Knew You"" when Smith is lifted up to the ship. At least Disney succeed to make the tragic ending overwhelmingly sad, actually the most saddest Disney moment ever.Speaking of ""If I Never Knew You"": I thought it was wise to cut the song and then put it back on the DVD ten years later. It's a complex and adult song, which would be to complex for the kids and actually I don't think I would like to sit during that song on the theater if I were a kid (since I saw this movie on theater as an 11-years old). But it's a beautiful song.If you manage to look through all the flaws and take this film for what it is, you'll have an enchanting experience. The rest is up to you.",Pocahontas

This is what happened to the ink that was leftover from The Lion King, one of Disney's biggest and most energetic movie to date. Having spent all their energy on the previous film, Disney couldn't possibly top themselves, and the result was a movie that seemed really lazy. The songs were unmemorable, as were the characters, and the story was rather boring. Meeko and Flit were, and still are, the most boring characters Disney ever created.

101,chrisbishop5000,Historically inaccurate?... Who cares? This is Disney!,9,18 August 2012,"This film does not do the expected job of transporting you back to the day when this historic legend really happened back in the early 1600s, instead, true to Disney form, it unravels yet another fairytale just with a Native American makeover. True there are Native American backdrops, some Native American music and, of course, Native American people but has been dusted with typical Disney fairytale magic and is not to be used as reference to the true story if you want it told accurately. But it wouldn't be Disney to bring the legend to life as such but to bring it to fairytale and fictional twists. Pocahontas' pets Meeko the raccoon and Flit the hummingbird would never have existed in true life, would they? Neither would Grandmother Willow. This was to be suitable for kids as well as grown-ups so Disney did their stuff and the result is very positive yet very underrated. The movie has received major criticism for its inaccuracy. Pocahontas and John Smith are lovers here and history states that they probably weren't at all and it is a known fact that Pocahontas was, in real life, much younger than in her Disney depiction (and not half as beautiful) and John Smith was much, much older than the handsome young man he is depicted to be here but what did the critics expect the film to contain - serious violence, serious war scenes, Pocahontas being held captive for a long time, Pocahontas being murdered at just 21? It'd be ordeal of a film experience for children and here we have a beautiful love story symbolizing the triumph of peace over war; plus brilliant songs, a haunting music score, lush animation and well-selected voice talents.As it is based on a true story, there is some drama here that could never be taken away, even from a Disney adaptation. Also, unlike other Disney fairy tales, we have a sad ending, a very sad ending. If I told you the ending I'd be telling! So you'll have to watch and find out.

104,filmbuff-05706,A Powerful 90's Disney Movie That Speaks To Modern Society.,10,12 October 2021,"I've grown up on Disney movies, and even though I am in my 20s I still love to watch them- however I don't watch them as frequently as I did as a kid. There's some that I used to watch all of the time, such as Toy Story, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.Then there's some I rarely touched at the time, Hunchback, Tarzan, and Robin Hood among them. (Not because I disliked them, I just didn't enjoy them as much as the ones above.)Then there are some that land in the middle- they weren't frequent viewings, however, I did visit them consistently. Pocahontas lands in this 3rd category.Revisiting this film for the first time in 7 years, I do enjoy it better, but unlike a film like Hunchback(now 2nd to Toy Story as my favorite), my thoughts are still about the same. I love it, don't get me wrong, but there's many I would rank above it.That aside, let's look at Pocahontas as an individual Disney animated film. The plot follows a young Indian woman named Pocahontas, who falls in love with an Englishman named John Smith(voiced by Mel Gibson). John and his men come to Pocahontas's land in hope of finding gold and becoming rich as a result.The most greedy of them all is the villain Radcliffe, voiced by David Odgen Stiers(who is most known for voicing Cogsworth, the clock in Beauty and the Beast.) He will stop at nothing to get the gold, even if John has some bad news about that....Pocahontas, looking at it as an animated movie, is drawn gloriously with vivid color. From tall trees to starry skies, the animators certainly put some of their best effort into this movie.One certain shot still astounds me and makes me appreciate the hard work animators put in. (And affirms that I will never be an animator, even with modern computers!) In the villain song Mine Mine Mine, Radcliffe sings about the gold ""there will be heaps of it and I will be on top of the heap!""The scene cuts to him wearing fancy gold clothes and walking down a huge flight of pink stairs. I can't imagine how much work it took to draw that alone repeatedly, but Disney animators should know that I appreciate the time and work done to complete it.The voice work is also well done. Apart from the work of Gibson and Stiers, Linda Hunt(aka Hetty in NCIS: Los Angeles) voices Grandmother Willow, a tree who advises Pocahontas with moral dilemmas.Comedian Billy Connolly voices the friends of John Smith, and current Batman actor Christian Bale plays Thomas, a good hearted friend of John who makes a bad, plot altering mistake in the climax.And while this does not contain the richest songs in Disney's canon, Pocahontas has a pleasing soundtrack. I've already mentioned Mine Mine Mine, Radcliffe's song of greed.However, Pocahontas has 2 particular famous songs. One is Just Around The Riverbend, where Pocahontas notices that rivers, like life, can never be steady or predictable. In the other(and my personal favorite), Colors of the Wind, Pocahontas tells John Smith that no matter what skin color a person has, everyone can befriend each other.That leads me to what is possibly the best thing about Pocahontas: the message. In an age where people protest about racism, this cartoon from 1995 shows us how to truly respect those who are of a different race.""Look around you"", Pocahontas tells her father. ""This is where the path of hatred has brought us."" Referring to her kindness to John Smith, she adds: ""This is the path I choose Father. What will yours be?""And while Pocahontas may not rank as high as Toy Story or Beauty and the Beast for me, this is what ultimately takes the cake for earning a 10/10 rating. Not only is it one of Disney's most beautiful looking and put together films, it has a message about tolerance of others that is relevant even today, 26 years later. (Sadly, one of the actors missed the memo...)Nevertheless, Pocahontas is a beautiful film, both visually and provocatively, that any one of any age can take to heart. It's not at the top of my ranking of Disney movies, but it's still a very powerful film in it's own right.Note: Many complain that this film is not historically accurate to the real life account of Pocahontas. To such critics, I would like to note that nearly no Disney movie is accurate to the source material(wait until you hear what Cinderella's stepsisters did to their feet), and this film is meant to be 81 minutes of family entertainment, not a history lesson. And it deserves to be treated as such.",Pocahontas
105,Norway1,Wonderful musical from fictitious version of true story.,7,27 September 1998,"Though not entirely surpassing the Lion King this was some of the best music ever experienced in an animated musical. Pocahontas is the daughter of a chief who wishes to find her path in life. She feels it her duty to keep peace between her own people and the intruding British who are hoping to find gold as did the early Spanish explorers. She finds herself falling in love with one of these new visitors and uses this relationship in attempting to prevent a potential war. But can she stop the greedy settlers from their determination to find Gold, and can she convince her Father that they should try to live in peace with their new neighbors? You may be pleasantly surprised. Between the music and the animation Pocahontas is a classic Disney film that should be included in every video collection. Just don't expect to learn any hidden truths about American history. Take it for what it is.",Pocahontas
106,forrestwrs,It's Stupid,3,15 September 2010,"Pocahontas is very possibly Disney's worst creation. This movie has two (count them: two) redeeming qualities. 1: The music is pretty cool. Not astounding, not amazing (it doesn't even come close to The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or even freaking Aladdin), but pretty cool. 2: The animation is nice to watch. Again, not astounding, not amazing (nowhere near as cool as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, or freaking Aladdin), but it is a high point of the film. Other than that, it blows.The biggest problem with the movie is that it pretty much takes US history and Native American history and rapes it. Pocahontas, instead of being like 13, is a full 18. Why? So she can have a love affair (something too often milked by Disney) with John Smith, whom is basically worshipped in this movie. Granted, I don't think historical accuracy should make or break a film, but here, it's WAY off. It's like if a movie depicted George Washington with superhuman strength. We kill Native Americans for gold, Pocahontas and John Smith communicate through freaking *magic*, and coastal Virginia is abundant in cliffs. Cliffs!And it's also saying something if I didn't even find this movie very entertaining when I was younger. Not because of the historical inaccuracies, but because it's just stupid. The characters are bland as sh*t, all of the parts concerning magic are nonsensical, and the storyline is wholly undeserving of its ""epic"" depiction. I put the word ""epic"" in quotes because even though they did try to make it look epic, at the end of the day, it just didn't happen.So, Pocahontas's biggest problem is that it's stupid. I feel like the filmmakers never bothered to read any history or anything about this subject. At all. And the characters are dull, the voice actors aren't really all that interesting, and the dialogue is pretty much worthless. Not Disney's best endeavor. Very possibly Disney's worst.3/10",Pocahontas

The problem however is that captain John Smith and Pocahontas might not ever have met in real life. I have no problem with the story at all but in this case they could have used fictional characters and not making it seem that this happened for real. The movie felt not like Disney except for the songs. The Colours of the wind is probably one of the best Disney songs ever. It's the classic Romeo an Julia story between a native girl and colonist man. This theme might have been done so many times that it gets boring at one point but I think it was done well here and makes you think, yes what if native Americans could have kept their land and culture? This movie needs multiple viewings to be liked, for me anyway.",Pocahontas
109,GSmith9072,Great music enhances a story refusing to exit Disney's rules for safe film-making,5,24 July 2007,"I hate to admit, but Disney's Pocahontas, a film near and dear to my heart, is indeed severely flawed. Aside from the film's wonderful beautiful imaginative score, the true core of the film, the character relationships, and the depiction of another culture are frighteningly one-note. Pocahontas can be considered a true children's film. There isn't really anything of substance to engage a mature viewer outside of the die hard Disney/children's entertainment addicts, and admittedly without the film's inspired songs, it would be pretty banal. The film truly aims for a satisfactory portrayal of Native American Indians. Nothing objectable, nothing indecorous from what we expect from Disney. Unfortunately, the story and characterization fall along the same guidelines. The film establishes the Native American society as very close to nature, and that the invading colonies basically aren't. The cultural gaps between the protagonists are hastily filled with several occurrences of Disney 'magic' and the like. The film is missing a true human core. Most of the criticism seems to come from the fact that the film is grossly inaccurate on the real story of the pubescent Indian and the fully grown settler. I find such criticism unfair and irrational. The film doesn't aim to please devout historians, but more importantly, Disney has no intention of creating their first PG-13 animated cartoon. And here the film succeeds in that children can watch a film with the name ""Pocahontas"" that hints to the familiar story taking place in Virgina, a noticeably 'flat' Virigina. Which brings me to a not very often mentioned criticism. The 'Virgina"" in the film resembles some place in Colarado. I admire the film's stylization, but I have a slight qualm on not being able to appreciate flat Virgina in it's own beauty. It seems even more problematic in a film who's major theme seems to be nature and the often overlooked wonders of it amidst rapid industrialization and economical corruption. That minor criticism seems to personify the bigger picture in why the film 'fails'. It settles for a shallow look into culture and prejudice that's easily accessible to children but leaves adults unmoved, aside again from the amazing music that the Disney Co. does finest. And really, the music makes the film, not-really-profound dialouge aside.",Pocahontas
110,nicolaperrin,The best Disney film ever!,10,31 July 2012,"I only saw this film about 4 years ago and i've been in love with it ever since. I love the entire story, the dialogue, the music, the animation. It's just amazing. The animation is beautiful and i love the way Pocahonta's hair flows. The music fits in so well, colours of the wind is the best Disney song i've ever heard. I have the CD soundtrack for this film and I love it! The ending is so sad for a Disney film but it's beautiful and very romantic. As she runs up to wave goodbye I get so emotional. It's just so different to other Disney films, I could watch it everyday. I just wish the sequel had been a lot better, it would have ended it all off so well.",Pocahontas
111,noalygh,"Little historical accuracy, so what?",9,14 April 2020,"Pocahontas is an enjoyable and extremely well-written film with depths and sublime animation and music. On the backdrop of a wild and beautiful native American land, the movie tells the story of love, self-discovery and misinterpretation. Sets in Virginia, North America in the 17th century, the movie is about Pocahontas, an Algonquin woman who struggles to find her path in the world, when a British ship reaches the village in its attempt to seek gold in the new land. After meeting a settler, John Smith, she quickly gets acquainted with him, but is torn between the disagreements of her people and the newcomers on Smith's side.I can understand that people are upset it did not accurately illustrate the events of what Europeans did during the Age of Exploration but this movie clearly sets out to achieve none of that. By using this setting to pin two opposite forces - white Europeans and Native Americans - against each other, the film tackles the idea of communication. As opposed to the close and cooperative relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith, the lack of understanding and communication between the two groups of people has resulted in subsequent events of anger, disagreement and violence. Many people take Pocahontas and John Smith's ability of talking to each other despite different languages as racism towards 'Indians', however, I feel like this is not the case at all. The decision to reduce the language barrier is important to express the story with better comprehension, especially for young children.The thing I love about the movie is the very realistic portrayal of characters from both the sides. Unlike Avatar (which evidently ripped off this, a-hem!), Pocahontas equally tells the view of both the tigers and the hunters. No one from the colonizers is one-dimensional and purely evil. All sailors, even though at first consider Native Americans savages and inhumane, are each painted as down-to-earth workers who are essentially exploited by the capitalists and oblivious of what native Americans really are. The Governor, invading the land for the sake of money, doesn't vainly target Indians for fun, it is only he thought that they hid all the gold. From the Native Americans' perspective, we are introduced to the characters - Pocahontas, her friend, her father, and soaked into their lives, their relationships and beliefs. We relate and feel for Pocahontas when she struggles to find the right path. We smile when she and Nakoma play with each other on the boat. The movie makes us care and fear for them upon the arrival of outsiders instead of dehumanizing the invaders (like Avatar did) to make us feel bad about the threats posed to the village.Alan Menken, once again, proves his magical talent for writing film scores by the timeless pieces in Pocahontas. 'Just Around the Riverbend', 'Grandmother Willow' and 'Colors of the Winds' are atmospheric and resounding songs that perfectly describe the greatness and enigma of nature; 'Steady as the Beating Drums' infiltrates the cultural village lives of the natives; while 'The Virginia Company' and 'Mine, Mine, Mine' imitates in rhythmic power of the crew's work. While strengthening the flow of emotions and visuals in the movie, the soundtrack really stands out on its own with these unforgettable hits that I found myself hooked on after watching.Great as it is, the movie has noticeable flaws. Pocahontas and John Smith's romance seems inorganic and rushed at some points. Their relationship is admirable in many ways for mutual respects and understanding for each other, but it should have stayed that way. Pocahontas' path of life, guided by nature, ultimately leads to John Smith, which makes her work of reconciling the two groups of people less relevant in the story. This makes Pocahontas more like a classic Disney princess who needs love than a heroine who leads her clan away from destruction.Given little credit among Disney productions, Pocahontas, however, is one of my favorite animated movies. The film is a modern-par and meaningful story about love and conflicts, with great animation and humor. If you forget political and sociological history and take it for what it is, you will find the ride compellingly as epic, light-hearted and fantastic as any other Disney classics.",Pocahontas
112,morphricky,The songs is the only good thing.,3,8 July 2012,"The songs for this movie are great and are a welcome treat between the mind-numbingly boring plot and the, quite frankly, dull looking animation. I remember watching this in the cinema as a child and only enjoyed the swirling winds animation when Pocahontas sings ""Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?"", otherwise the animation lacks shading which makes everything appear flat.For some reason, all the good characters just end up very bland and boring. And they have too much dialog for me to sit through, I'm certain more than 75% of this movie is just talking. Thankfully the sidekick animals don't have any words to speak, it was the only way I could even put up with them.I much more enjoy the soundtrack rather than the actual movie, even the instrumental pieces are wonderful.",Pocahontas

I rewatched it last night and finally grasped just how great it was over 20 years later.The animation and scenery were both gorgeous and the colors in the Virginia countryside were fantastic. No, it wasn't historically accurate, but it did contain issues that hold significance to this day. I truly believe that this film belongs in the top 5 Disney films ever.Pocahontas character was the most realistic Disney figure to that point and the animal characters were hilarious. One can only hope that with the passing of time that Pocahontas will get the respect it deserves.",Pocahontas
114,wittkecmission,Has its ups and downs,7,3 January 2020,"When Pocahontas was first released, the Disney Renaissance of the 90's came to a crashing halt. Many people were outraged and now, with adult eyes, I understand why. When you compare a film like this to the previous Disney films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King, it's a huge letdown, not to mention very rushed, with a running time of only 81 minutes. It's a letdown mainly because of the story-telling. I'd like to believe that this movie is based on the myth of Pocahontas, not the actual history. But sometimes, I doubt that that was the case. There are plot points in the film that are insulting to both people's intelligence and history. Two of the most notable are that Pocahontas had a talking tree as a mentor (really?) and that she could instantly learn the English Language just by ""listening with her heart"". But enough about the bad things. Let's talk about the good things: the original score. Oh my god, this is Alan Menken at his absolute best. The moment when Pocahontas and John Smith first meet at the waterfall, or when they bid farewell to each other towards the end, the music in those scenes alone make the whole movie beautiful. And the visuals. Next to Fantasia, this movie has the best use of color in any Disney film I've ever seen. This movie was a prominent film in my childhood, but due to the rather dull story-telling and use of history and rushed pace, I'm only giving it a 7/10.",Pocahontas
115,Awakening124,I forgot just how beautiful this movie is...why is it so underrated??,10,19 March 2009,"I haven't watched Pocahontas in maybe ten years, but I was feeling nostalgic one day and popped it in. I could not believe how truly BEAUTIFUL this movie is, in every aspect. MUSIC: Aside from the songs everyone knows (Just Around the River Bend and Colors of the Wind) every single other song in the film is wonderful, with soaring harmonies and Broadway quality singing. Everything was masterfully written and executed. The music alone is reason enough for this to be adapted into a full out Broadway musical, but don't worry...the music is brilliant but it doesn't scream ""MUSICAL!"" like Hairspray or Mamma Mia.ANIMATION: Drop. Dead. Gorgeous. Every single frame is such wonderful eye candy, and the camera work serves the sweeping storyline extremely well.STORY: Dramatic (with it's humorous moments of course), romantic, and it carries a very important message of peace, maturity, and fighting against ignorance and prejudice from BOTH sides. This is possibly the Disney movie with the greatest message for kids.HISTORIC ACCURACY: Yes, Disney changed the true story quite a bit, but if you look to Disney for accurate re-tellings of historical events you have a serious PROBLEM. This movie is more 'Inspired by' than 'Based on' and since the true story is about a 13-14 year old falling in love with 30-40 year I think we can all appreciate that they took some liberties with a KIDS' MOVIE.All in all, I really don't get why this isn't revered as a classic right along with The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast.",Pocahontas
116,moviecritichank-7,The Weakest Film of the Disney Renaissance,7,5 July 2018,"Pocahontas is the 33rd full-length animated feature released by Walt Disney Pictures in 1995. Billed by Disney with the tagline of ""An American Legend Brought to Life"", it is the story of the free-spirited Pocahontas who seeks to convince her father Chief Powhatan to make peace between her Native American tribe and the English settlers of the New World of Jamestown that arrive in search of gold and prosperity. During the production of this film, then Chairman of the Walt Disney Studios Jeffrey Katzenberg regarded Pocahontas as a home run film film for Disney in light of what he thought to be the more mature story in comparison to ""The Lion King"", which was released a year earlier. However, while it was the 4th highest grossing film world-wide in '95 and did pretty well on the home video market in '96, this film didn't quite live up to the standard set by its predecessors like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King. However, while it's my least favorite film of the storied Disney Renaissance era, there were still some things that I actually liked about the film which I will highlight in this review.I'd say that like most of the Disney films that came out before (and especially during) the Renaissance period for Disney, Pocahontas is very strong in the music department! Before I ever saw this movie, I remember being in awe of the song ""Colors of the Wind"", which is the scene that appeared in the previews for the VHS of The Lion King. In spite of the shallow character development (which I will highlight in this review), Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz did a fantastic job on the songs and the score in this movie. For me, the song ""If I Never Knew You"" takes the cake for best song in this movie and it's only sung in the credits for the theatrical version of the film. I liked how deep the lyrics are as they highlight the meaning behind John Smith's line ""I'd rather die tomorrow than live 100 years without knowing you"", which he quotes to Pocahontas right before he is to be executed the next dawn. I do wish that they left the song in the final cut of the film, but it is on the special edition DVD/Blu-Ray version. I also enjoyed the song ""Savages"" mainly because it highlights the animosity that the settlers have towards the Native Americans for capturing John Smith as well as the animosity that the Native Americans have towards the settlers and John Smith for the death of one of their own (even though it wasn't him that pulled the trigger). The song serves as a reminder to us that we should never justify killing/wanting to kill someone out of hatred just because they might be different than us. Now for the weaknesses of the film. Oh boy, where to start! While the movie is based off of the Native American legend and the Disney animators did the right thing by going to Jamestown to get the inspiration for their animation, they definitely missed the ball in a few areas. Let's touch on some of the historical inaccuracies for a bit. In 1607 (the year that the settlers arrived to Jamestown and which the movie is set), Pocahontas (who was born in 1596) was around 10-11 years old when she met John Smith, who was 26-27 years old at the time. Did that matter to Disney though? No, because they just had to make this a love story in the vein of Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid. However, unlike Pocahontas, those stories are fairy tales. This is key part of American history and now that I'm older I definitely think that Disney did a great disservice to children by taking what could've been an educational introduction to the Native American legend by giving them a love story that didn't happen in real life. Anyways, as far as character development is concerned, while not nearly as dull, wooden, bland, and static as Aurora, Snow White, or Cinderella, Pocahontas (voiced by Irene Bedard) is still a pretty boring and one-dimensional character with very little motive to her, which is a shame with her being the main protagonist and all. While also underdeveloped and one-dimensional, I found her best friend Nakoma to be a much more interesting character than that of Pocahontas. The rest of the Native Americans such as Chief Powhatan (voiced by Russell Means) and Kocoum (who is your basic stereotypical jock placed in colonial times) were pretty flat and boring too. I actually found the settlers to be much more entertaining, mainly the comic screwball Wiggins! As far as John Smith (voiced by Mel Gibson) is concerned, I would've much rather seen him portrayed with the harsh and gruff exterior that he showed to his men in real life. The best characters in this film were Meeko, Flit (voiced by Frank Welker), and Grandmother Willow (voiced by Linda Hunt), who is by far one of the wisest characters that Disney has ever created. Another thing that made the four films which preceded this one (and a few that came after it) was a strong, round, and dynamic Disney antagonist. In this one we get Governor Ratcliffe (voiced by the late great Disney legend David Ogden Stiers). While he did a good job (as he always does) of voicing the character, Ratcliffe still remains a forgettable villain when compared to the likes of Scar, Jafar, Hades, Frollo, and other villains in the Disney catalog as he lacked that despicable, disgusting nature that is trademark of a memorable Disney villain. So, while I think that this movie as a whole is the weakest of this era of Disney magic in regards to story (not being historically factual) and character development (being shallow and one-dimensional), it was still a decently animated film with great songs and music that deserves at least one viewing. Not my favorite (even though I did own it on VHS growing up), but still worth showing to your kids on family movie night! Rating: 7/10.",Pocahontas
117,c-corleis,One of the better modern Disney films,7,14 January 2006,"Yes, this is surely one of the better modern Disney films. The story is straight and well focused on the two main characters. We have some sidekicks here, the little dog and the raccoon. Both works very well, with loving little gags and without any tendency to crude jokes, that often seen in modern Disney-films, i.e. the stupid fart-joke in ""The Lion King"", which, in my opinion, disturbing this good movie too much. ""Pocahontas"" match the spirit of the older Disney classics well. I love especially the impressionistic, colorful sequences. It is a wonderful way to tell a story with colors, pictures and music rather than dialogue. A technique, that was first used in ""Fantasia"" and than pushed up to the utmost perfectionism in ""Bambi"", and later get lost in the most modern Disney movies. And there is another detail, that i like very much: The villain is not really a totally cruel villain. He had his own problems too, and he was more driven by the demand of his company to find gold under all circumstances. The film did not focus exactly on historical facts, but come on, it is a Disney film, and it had is dark and sad scenes too. As i know, this was only the third Disney-movie (after ""Bambi"" and ""The Lion King"") in which a important character died, which is not one of the villains. Fortunately the end of the movie is ""not typical Disney"". it was done very well in a wonderful closing scene, but without that the... but i will not spoil it for you! But some disappointments are here too: ""Pocahontas"" can't mess with the detailed Animation and deep characters of the older Disney films, especially Disney's ""Big Five"": ""Snow White"", ""Pinocchio"", ""Fantasia"", ""Dumbo"", and especially ""Bambi"" are invincible in the detailed animation and the characters. In ""Pocahontas"" all of this is far simpler done, perhaps to decrease the costs of the movie and not because the animators can't do it better. Overall, i give it 7 out of 10 stars and i hope, that modern Disney will come back to movies of this high quality in the future again.",Pocahontas

I think it is frankly a nasty glorification of a chain of horrific events in the history of the continent and spreads the wrong idea entirely. The real girl this was loosely based off of had an immeasurable amount of trauma and so did her relatives and friends and I think this movie is just kind of pointless and gross and does not accomplish anything good for how settler and native relations are historically perceived. Also I think it's stupid how they could just magically speak the same language with the power of their hearts like come on 😭🙏 . Also there was clearly not a lot of effort put into designing the native characters and practices to be anywhere near historically accurate.

120,kennethtownsend-97230,Pocahontas analysis and review,9,15 October 2015,"The movie is very spiritual and free. It talked mainly about the differences between the colonist and the Indians. In both eyes of the group they saw each other as savages. The Indians love their land and their people and see that the British want to take it for them so the British can search for gold. When the British first arrive they stat digging for gold and search for the Indians. As the British start to settle in to the new land and alarm goes off. The Indians are aware of the visitors so the Indians go to search them. One Indian is spotted and shot thus meaning to the Indians that the British are I good and deserve to be punished.Pocahontas, the main character, has dealt with a major loss in her life when her mother past away. From then on she has tried to find her path when a strange dream has kept coming up in her sleep. She is asked for her hand in marriage by a very serious non- spiritual soldier and says that this path hat she would take with him is not what she wants. So when she mat John Smith they were aware and alert of each other when they first met but soon found a strong liking in each other and this lead toward between the two groups.",Pocahontas
121,joebrian55,Probably the worst Disney movie of the 1990's,5,22 December 2012,"I'll be honest, Pocahontas is the Disney movie of the 90's that appeals to me the least.For nearly a year, I've heard some negative statements about the movie from a couple of the teachers at my high school (they both teach history, keep in mind).In the past, Disney has been known for their adaptations of classic literature... but a historical figure was obviously not the best choice for their next movie after the immense success of The Lion King, and it shows.While the artwork is good, the music is good and such, the story is very weak and predictable. Note that this sort of plot has been used by various movies, including Avatar and Dances with Wolves. And on top of that, this film is a grossly inaccurate representation of Native American history, with the conflict between the British and Natives toned down to be little more than a simple fight between two sides that almost never happens thanks to Pocahontas saving John Smith. However, I do give the movie credit for casting First Nations actors to voice the Natives, such as the late Russell Means as Chief Powhatan and Gordon Tootoosis as Kekata.Sure the backgrounds and character designs for the humans are realistic and look great, but the story is also important for an animated movie, and in the case of a movie based on history or culture, historical and cultural accuracy.Fortunately, the film has a good message, ""Everyone is different and people are people no matter how they look"", but Disney has not always been good at teaching that to children, like The Fox and the Hound, which had a good message but in this case, it was not clear on target audience. On top of that, there should be better ways to teach children that it's OK to be different.So really, I don't know whether to recommend it or not. Maybe it would be best to watch it with children and explain some things about it later so that children aren't mislead by this movie.",Pocahontas
122,avsroxbronxfan,The movie is terrible... if you compare it to the classics before it.,5,8 November 2012,"Pocahontas was the first Disney film released after the Disney Renaissance, which includes films like Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, or The Lion King. If you are going to compare Pocahontas to any of those masterpieces, the film is horrendous. But as a film on its own, it's not terrible, even though I am not fond of it.My biggest complaint about the film is that it's basically a re-telling of how the new land was founded, even though they made most of it up. Come on, we've heard this story many times. But they do also want to connect us with nature, and animals. ""Colors of the Wind"" is a good example of this but I'll get to the songs in just a minute. I find it ironic that the story wants to connect with nature, but animals can't talk. I have one more question about that, however. How come the animals can't talk, but the tree Pocahontas talks to can? I don't get it.Speaking of her, she's not very interesting, and neither is John Smith. I find that odd because Mel Gibson voices him. In addition to my other complaints, I do not like Governor Ratcliffe. Is he even supposed to be the villain everyone claims he is? To me, he's just some gold-obsessed person who thinks the Indians are evil. Jafar I consider a villain. Maleificant is another I believe to truly be evil. Ratcliffe, on the other hand, is just some guy who wants gold and has decent military skills.Anyway, I have one more complaint, and then I will talk about the good stuff. Why are all the Indians copper skinned, and all the British folk have white skin? I know this is a kids film, but no racism! Anyway, I love the songs in this film, especially ""Savages"" and ""Colors Of The Wind"". I know Alan Menken, the same guy who did songs for Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and The Little Mermaid made these songs, but I honestly feel this is some of his best work. And speaking of colors, this film has an excellent design and very colorful imagery. The characters and backgrounds look amazing. I also love the raccoon that accompanies Pocahontas. This guy is very funny. I love how he's basically a bully to the spoiled dog. I also like how one of my favorite actors, Christian Bale, is in this film.In conclusion, I consider this film to be one of the weaker Disney films. It's not Home on the Range bad, but I didn't like this one.",Pocahontas
123,natashasarin,A Beautiful Animated Movie,10,28 July 2019,"Hating this movie just because it isn't historically accurate is pretty sad. If you watch it with an open mind, remembering that it IS a Disney movie, I think you'll see just how beautiful it really is. It bugs me when people say it's racist towards Native Americans, because if anything, it shows them in a much better light than it does the White settlers. The song Savages is one of the most powerful songs to ever come out of the Disney Studios, as it demonstrates the pure hatred that the English and the Native Americans have for each other as well as Pocahontas being the middle person, the peacemaker, who wants to stop both sides from fighting. Colours of the Wind is the hymn of humanity, as it teaches us to respect the Earth and everything that lives in and on it. The romance between Pocahontas and John Smith is one of the most meaningful that Disney has ever created - their meeting scene is absolutely gorgeous, their chemistry is real and believable, and Pocahontas is able to open up the initially arrogant and shallow John's mind to see things in ways he had never seen them before. And in If I Never Knew You, they express their love and gratitude for one another in a song filled with so much emotion.The animation is stunning, the songs are stunning, and the score is (in my opinion) the best Disney score. The ending of the movie adds so much more meaning to the overall message of the film, as it shows us that Pocahontas knows where her priorities lie and she remains forever loyal to her people because they need her - and the music that accompanies that whole finale scene does so absolutely perfectly.

Most of the movies that were released by Walt Disney Company in the 90s were good. Especially 'Pocahontas', this is a very good movie for the whole family. It's worth watching and especially for racialist people; they may end up knowing themselves better after watching this movie. The plot is about a Native American girl 'Pocahontas' who starts a romantic relationship with an English adventurer 'John Smith' out for gold in the land where Indians live with other men. Actually John Smith and the other men are fooled along with their leader who insists that there is gold hidden in the land; when in fact there is no gold. However, this issue starts a fight between the English men and Indians, and after Pocahontas revealed the truth to John Smith about the gold myth clearly, the both try to stop the fight between the two teams.This movie shows that hatred and war aren't always ways to solve a problem.

The fact that she fell in love with John Smith was sweet and touching, but they were from different villages. Also, I felt bad for Pocahontas when she went to go talk to her father after Kocoum got shot and her father was like ""I told you to stay in the village. You disobeyed me. You have shamed your father."" I'm sorry that happened, but she got what she deserved. She kept sneaking away from the village when she was told to stay put. People were wondering where she was at and worried sick about her. And you know else? She's lucky that she wasn't shot dead that night. Do you think that her father wanted to find out she was dead somewhere? People were out there with guns ready to blow their brains out and she's sneaking away. I know she was in love with Smith, but that's no excuse for disobeying her father. If she wanted to help, she should have obeyed the rules, instead of violating them. Well, that was courageous of her when she saved Smith from being killed by her father. Plus, I am glad that her father came around and chose not to kill Smith. I liked that scene. He let him live.

126,blackwolf14016,"Not acurate, but still very good.",9,31 August 2003,"Many people complain about this movie being ""Far from the truth"". It's NOT supposed to be. Otherwise, we would probably see Pocahontas as a 13 year old, and I doubt we would see a talking tree. If you want an accurate portrayal of the life of Pocahontas, go check out a documentary or a book from your local library. If you want the story turned into an enjoyable, animated classic, watch this movie. It's supposed to be a musical ""Loosely based on"" the story of Pocahontas (Bedard), a Native American princess. John Smith (Gibson) is an English adventurer, the captain of an expedition to the ""New World"". When the two meet, they fall in love, only to find that the English and the Indians are set to go to war....The voice acting in this movie is very good. Gibson does a great job of portraying the adventerous John Smith, even though he doesn't have much of an English Accent. Irene Bedard as Pocahontas is excllent as well. The 'lesser' parts are also well voiced, particularly the sinister Govenor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers). The animation is great, though not quite as good as some other (even earlier) Disney films. But overall, I'd give it 8/10. The absolute best part of the movie are the songs. Obviously the best one has to be ""Colors of the Wind"", one of my all-time favorites. ""Savages"" was #2 on my list, the drums really gave you that ""War is coming"" kind of feel. All the rest are almost as good. Even if you didn't like the movie, I strongly reccomend the soundtrack.

Ok, maybe it wasn't exactly historically accurate, but hey, it wasn't aiming to be so. Appreciate it for what it does have: Solid animation, great songs, and a beautiful story. One other complaint that I feel is wrong is how Governor Ratcliffe is such a weak villain. That's wrong. He was a great villain. One person said that all he wanted to do was help Smith. That's wrong. Ratcliffe didn't go to fight the Indians to help Smith, he went to kill the Indians so he could get the gold. And personally, I don't believe he was the real big bad villain. The real villain was the concept of misunderstanding, just like the concept of temptation was the true villain in Pinocchio. Ratcliffe's no Jafar or Gaston or Scar, but he doesn't need to be.This movie doesn't deserve to be bashed the way it is, and I'd give it a 9/10 (It's not Aladdin, but it's good enough).",Pocahontas

The rest of the family hated it, too, which was odd considering we've always loved Disney animated films since forever.It was a bunch of things that made this movie sour.  There was no real plot... I mean, Pocahontas and John Smith must try to reconcile harsh feelings between the settlers and the Native Americans, but it proceeded slowly and didn't flow real well, and other than the fact that everyone must 'try to get along', there really WASN'T a plot.  There was also the violence; two people are shot, and some of the more passionate scenes were a little overdone.  I think the thing that confused most of the folks was how Pocahontas magically spoke English all of a sudden; one moment, she couldn't understand John Smith, and the next, she could suddenly converse with him.And the ending was awful.I'd say this ranks as one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

133,Imshortok06,A Timeless Classic,9,4 January 2007,"Despite its historical inaccuracies, Disney's Pocahontas was a wonderfully vibrant tale of love and courage. The animation was breathtaking, to say the least. One thing that I focus on when seeing a movie for the first time is the music - does the music go well with the theme? To answer this question, all the songs were brilliantly conveyed through their lyrics and melodies. Up there with the other Disney classics, Pocahontas deserves to be cherished by generations to come.It's amazing how they pick the perfect people to voice the characters; Mel Gibson (along with the others) did a great job.

I still do watch it on the internet, because of awesome high-lights in the movie. All of the songs in it were just outstanding and magical at the same time. The three songs that made it to the top 100 Greatest Disney Songs of All Time were Just Around the River Bend, If I Never Knew You (from the 10th Anniversiry Edition in 2005), and of course, the amazing Colors of the Wind song. My favorite character was John Smith (the man that Pocahontas loves a lot), because he is so handsome, bold, and his voice sounds great when he is speaking and singing. Thank you very much Disney for making this absolutely marvelous film, and I am 100% sure Walt Disney himself would have appreciated this wonderful film.",Pocahontas
135,ghostofdaniel,The greatest underrated Disney's gem !,10,9 July 2004,"When this movie came out (in 1995), I thought : ""Another one ""big stupid kiddy Disney American colonialist propaganda movie"" ! Nobody thinks no more about a love story between an Indian girl and a colonialist ! The indians were exterminated by the colonialists ! Not loved by them ! Everybody knows that !""And I didn't watch such of silly movie, of course ! I'm not a stupid man !BUT, there's a week ago, the daughter of my sister (9 years old), forgot that DVD in my home. I thought : ""Let's see this stupidity, just to laugh at the most ridiculous Disney's movie !""I watched it. And I cryed. This is the best Disney's movie, and maybe the best movie, I've ever watched !How can you criticize it ? Have you lost your children soul ?!!Of course, just after watched it, I thought : ""Well, that's good. Better than I thought. But that's all"".But the next day, the song of the old ""mother witch"" remains in my mind ! I decided to watch it again, and again. Now, I've seen this movie about 20 times in one week. That's incredible, I think I'm a fan !!!!For me, in general, the worst part of a Disney movie, was the songs. I've always hated them. For the first time, I found the songs were the best part of this movie ! I listened to every songs of this movie, and I think, they are all good, and even, great ! Also the music ! It's an Mozart's opera !Graphics are good, but the editing is better ! The first encounter between Pocahontas and Smith at the falls is a pure master-piece ! And the movie's references are plenty ! The ""3-voices song"" of ""savages"", reminds me the ""rumbles"" of ""West Side Story"", and the final ""goodbye"" reminds me the final of Spielberg's ""E.T."".I don't know if this movie was done ""for children"", but I know I cry every time I watch it ! Thanks for Mike Gabriel, Eric Goldberg, Alan Menken, Stephen Schwartz, and the Disney Company to have kept their ""children soul"". I was wrong and they were right. And I'm happy of that.Well, I quit you now, I need to watch this movie again... Goodbye ! :-))10/10 !!!!!! of course !",Pocahontas
136,djm-11,A disgrace of a Disney movie,2,26 August 1999,This is the worst movie ever. EVER. Disney I guess decided to stop their great streak of great movies by making this piece of garbage. The sad thing is this movie came out on my birthday. Pocahontas is a sappy female character and Mel Gibson should have said no to this stinker of a cartoon movie.,Pocahontas
137,SevenStitches,"Definitely a film that distinguishes itself from other films outside the company, if not within it.",6,29 May 2006,"Disney was arguably at the top of their game in the early to mid-nineties, maybe even rivalling their original Golden Age back in the beginning. The secret to this was a somewhat new, but still rather basic template that most of their greats embraced: an array of catchy and moving songs, sweeping score, beautiful animation, engaging story, a mixture of lively and sympathetic characters and a diverse sense of humour that spreads across a broad age range. An ominous thing to follow up, which is exactly what Disney did with this, their first animated feature based on documented history, that of Pocahontas, the American Indian Princess romanced by the soldier John Smith, part of a crew of early European settlers trying to purge the New World. Their love is one that births in the midst of a conflict between the ever consuming and greedy settlers and the peaceful but weary Powhatan Indians. Can their love spawn a realisation that both sides can teach each other so much more than they can destroy? I won't pretend to know anything substantial about the history of the New World, or what really did happen between Pocahontas and John Smith, and even if I did, I'd still base my opinion more broadly on the quality of film presented and the story that it's trying to tell, even if it might be far from established truth, which Disney is no stranger in. Saying this however, ""Pocahontas"" does represent a very sanitised version of the relationship between the European conqueror's and the Powhatan Indians. The main gist of what was happening at the time is present, but it hardly reeks of authenticity. However, Disney went to great strengths to give an accurate portrayal of the Native Indians in their film (due to oversensitive PC disputes over their previous films' cultural portrayals) and they do a commendable job as most of the attire and cultural behaviour looks to be quite authentic and raw.""Pocahontas"" contains most of the commendable traits previously outlined, only this time it downplays the playful elements. This is a serious tale of tragic love, racial tolerance and a slightly overused conservationist theme. Some of the establishing characteristics of the Indians are a bit over done. The Powhatans seem to have a Utopian life, typically in tune with nature and with each other, which is good and all, but comes off as a little forced. However this is only glaringly apparent in brief moments. Plus some of the lessons to be learnt throughout the film can sometimes seem heavy handed, too obviously amplified for the kids' benefit. And my last gripe, the resolution at the end seemed lazy and convenient, plus the language barriers encountered by the two races, while handled in an outrageously but suitably intriguing way early in the film, become inconsistent and implausible later on.But ""Pocahontas"" does have undeniable positives. The animation is a change in style that harks back to the angular, stained glass look to ""Sleeping Beauty"". It works beautifully and gives the West Virginian forests a grand majesty, along with the characters who also look great. Colours are vibrant and often reflect the mood of the more intense scenes. CGI is used sparingly but most prominently in the character Grandmother Willow, a standout in this film for artistic and technical prowess. We also have three cute sidekicks, all of which are silent for a change. We have Pocahontas' Meeko the raccoon, Flit the hummingbird and General Radcliffe's Percy, a smug pug. The physical antics of these guys reflect the main conflict in the story, which is a nice touch. Their lack of dialogue also lends a far more endearing quality to them.The romance is handled well and does generate a sense of tragedy. The conflict between the races, while sanitized historically, is still very well done, with both sides having negative and positive traits that are rightfully juxtaposed throughout the film. But overall the narrative seems simplistic and heavy handed at times when representing racial equality amidst the conflict and its spiritual vibe towards peaceful living with nature.Voice work is as always with Disney quite flawless, with regular David Ogden Stiers giving a level of pompousness and greed to the villain General Radcliffe; Mel Gibson fits his role as John Smith to a T (with a surprisingly good singing voice too); Irene Badard also gives strength and life to Pocahontas; Linda Hunt does a grand job with Grandmother Willow (sorry), and last but not least, Native American activist Russell Means gives authority to Chief Powhatan.What I found to be the greatest asset of this film is its astonishing music. Disney regular at this time Alan Menken composed the score while together with Steven Schwartz wrote the lyrics to the songs. They were deservedly rewarded two Academy Awards for Best Song (""Colours of the Wind"") and Best Original Score. The songs are at times lively and beautifully sombre (including the Special Edition's ""If I Never Knew You"", adding a lot more depth to the romance), the stand out been ""Colours of the Wind"", a powerful tribute to nature's misunderstood beauty and providing one of the film's most rousing musical sequences. The score itself once again fuses all of the major songs into a fantastic tour de force that at times erupts with emotional potency (particularly at the end). Really a musical highlight for the Disney formula.""Pocahontas"" is a step down from ""The Lion King"", along with all of the renaissance offerings, suffering not necessarily from its historical inaccuracy (although that was and still is pitted against it) but from a few niggles and sloppy ends in the screenplay. The fact that it's a jarring change of pace from the previous films' more lightly handled methods of story telling could have also lead to the general lack of popularity. Nevertheless, this is a commendable achievement with Disney's trademark outstanding music, beautiful animation, strong voice work and great characters.",Pocahontas
138,Wilson102,What a world of difference! Excellent! Disney finally gets it right!!,9,15 October 2008,"I just got this 10th anniversary edition today and I LOVE it! The additional scene with the beautiful love song ""If I Never Knew You"" brings the movie all together and it makes much more sense with the scene. For years I had heard that there was a 'missing scene' in this movie, and I remember thinking how the original scene in the teepee between Pocahantas and John Smith seemed so abruptly cut short and terribly truncated. About 5 years ago on ABC, The Wonderful World of Disney showed Pocahantas with this 'deleted scene', but it was not complete. At the time it featured 'live' animation of the view of the hole through the top of the teepee, and stills with voice-overs from Mel Gibson and Irene Bedard. The big deal at the time was that it featured Mel Gibson singing, and I remember seeing an interview with Mel at the time saying (sic) ""I got to sing a love song but they cut the scene!"" But the funny thing is that I could swear that I read that this scene was complete at the time the original was released, but cut just before the release. (Anyone know about this?) I guess it doesn't matter now because the Disney Co. finally restored this very touching and beautiful song to this anniversary version, and it makes the story so much more real and compelling. There is also a reprise of the couple singing the song just before the end and it is the icing on the cake. I'm not always pleased with Disney DVD releases, but this one they got right! Also, they had the sense to release it in the widescreen ratio so you get to see the whole, beautiful product in all of its glory! (They should do this with all their releases!--How about a widescreen special edition of MoonSpinners? Hint-Hint!) Also, you can watch the original theatrical release on this DVD, but I don't know why you'd want to! P.S. Mel sings beautifully!",Pocahontas
139,charliote13,"""If We Never Had This Movie.........................................""",10,4 January 2008,"Disney made a statement by giving this film an ending nobody saw coming. Though this movie is loosely based on the true story of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith the way it was altered was stunning, the music and songs were fantastic, and thirdly the cast was incredible. The talent Christian Bale(a.k.a. Batman:Bruce Wayne) and Mel Gibson(a.k.a. director of The Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto) have made the voice irreplaceable. The people of this film were giving this movie a way to pave the way for other great films such as Mulan, Tarzan, and Lilo and Stitch. The songs ""Colors of the Wind"" and ""Just Around the Riverbend"" show how the Native Americans were about the Earth and how we should live our lives our way by choosing and going down the right path. The most stunning shocker was when the Disney crew of this film, Alan Menken, and Stephen Shwartz pulled the song ""If I Never Knew You"" from the collection of songs to be used for the movie. They thought it would be to emotional for the target audience, kids and families. But it was looked at as a film for adults because they would grasp the ending better. It was later inserted at the end credits to the popular Disney pop versions sung by Jon Secada and Shanice. In the DVD release it was inserted to the Special Edition was released sung by Mel Gibson and Judy Kuhn, the original singing voices(Mel also speaking as John Smith). The film picked up two Oscar wins with Best Original Song: ""Colors of the Wind"" and Best Original Score. I saw this movie when I was three and was so into it that I couldn't stop thinking about why ""A Love So Strong and True"" could be so separated. I watched it again when I was old enough to get it and realized how their people were and how the ""Colors of the Wind"" combined them together and what makes ""A Love So Strong and True"". I warn parent with young children to watch it with them. Don't allow a young child watch it alone. I advise people to watch it when they are ten and older to watch it by themselves.So as ""If We Never Had This Movie we Would Be Safe But Half As Real""",Pocahontas
140,lilmufasa2,generally unimpressed: started the decline,3,18 August 2008,"I don't know why they make such a big deal about this film. the sole thing i like about this film was Colors of the Wind. I saw a sneak peek of this film while watching The lion king on video and was excited about an American film, a great break from the recent films where the main settings were in Austrailia, France, Arabia, and Africa. Overall i was unimpressed primarily due to the fact that they try to make it too much of a movie. Later when i learned that this film was predicted to follow Beauty and the Beast's footsteps and Beat lion king, i was increasingly disappointed. There were a few good films during the post lion king years(Hercules, Toy story, Tarzan) but this film started the decline to where Disney animation is today. Could've been better. :[",Pocahontas
141,Tinny-Tinette,"Pocahontas; A flawed, but beautiful masterpiece.",7,14 April 2014,"""Pocahontas"" is a film which stands with a bad reputation. While it fortunately has a fan base, it's also a film that many people loves to hate with a passion. After all, many consider it as the picture that ended the Disney Renaissance that began so promisingly with ""The Little Mermaid"" and the films that followed ""Pocahontas"" grossed less (with the exception of ""Tarzan""). While ""Pocahontas"" wasn't a box office failure, it made less money than it's predecessors. Most animation fans know that ""Pocahontas"" was originally going to be the ambitious project and ""The Lion King"" was seen as the inferior picture. However, the tables turned and ""Pocahontas"" suffered the fate of being the inferior follow-up to ""The Lion King"". Despite that ""Pocahontas"" have always been a favorite of mine, it's easy to see why the film has failed to connect with many. Despite being deeply steeped in the Disney formula, it does comes across as a departure from the earlier Renaissance films, as being more serious and somber at times. The film had also many things against it, as being the first film based on historical events (though the story of Pocahontas is surrounded by myths), the PC-message about tolerance, the depiction of Native Americans and the portrayal of Pocahontas herself as a Native American version of Barbie. The former issues are enough to hamper the movie and along with ""The Lion King"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Pocahontas"" was a part of the new Disney trend of making more serious, epic pictures, but the ambition seemed more to hurt the film than to help it. So therefore ""Pocahontas"" will probably never seen as the same league as the earlier films from the Renaissance.Besides the obvious flaws, the strengths of this movie excels. First of all; The visuals are amazing. With grand, spectacular views of the Virginian Forrest and bright, pastel colors, the film is a feast for the eyes. The color scheme are quite noteworthy, with adding some deep colors that bathes the entire scene and it's characters. The vertical design of the Forrest is also successful, as are the characters designs, more angular than you usually expect from Disney. In terms of character animation, ""Pocahontas"" is superior to it's predecessors, bringing the ""character acting"" to new heights, by letting tiny, subtle expressions on the humans faces be obvious. The music is wonderful, simply being Menken's best work. While the music for his former films were great, ""Pocahontas"" blows them out of the water. Stephen Schwartz lyrics are also quite successful, from the depiction of Native American phrases and philosophy from ""Steady As The Beating Drum""/""Colors of the Wind"" and surprisingly hard-hitting and spiteful rhymes in ""Savages"" (though Schwartz would outdo himself even further with his lyrics for ""Hellfire"" in ""Hunchback).""Pocahontas"" have been criticized for it's weak and bland characterizations, but I have to disagree. The characters may not light up the screen, but they are certainly not entirely detestable. Although a few of them can be grating at times (Percy, Flit and Nakoma), the rest of the characters are acceptable. Pocahontas herself has been criticized for being bland and boring and while she comes across as reserved, she still possesses a dignity and strength that makes her appealing. She's as headstrong and adventurous Ariel and Belle, but she's definitively a more complex and mature character than both of them. Irene Bedard and Judy Kuhn beautiful voices compliments her character. Although Smith is a charming main lead, he comes across as a inferior character, thanks to Mel Gibson's weak performance. Ratcliffe may come across as a weak villain, but he does possess some personality now and then. Russell Means brings dignity and power to Chief Powhatan, while Christian Bale delivers a likable Thomas. Billy Connolly and Joe Baker delivers some fun to Ben and Lon and David Ogden Stiers delivers some spark to Wiggins (as he also did with Ratcliffe). The most successful character is indeed Grandmother Willow, beautifully conveyed by Linda Hunt. Secondary comes Meeko, stealing every scene that he's in.Where ""Pocahontas"" falls flat is on it's ambition. The movie does comes across as ""trying too hard"" at times. Besides the interactions between the animals and a few one liners, the film doesn't really rely on humor. While other Disney films excels with their serious tones, ""Pocahontas"" comes across as being somber and melancholic at times, which is a sign of the film trying too hard to be serious and epic. I personally didn't mind the PC-message and the lack of a climatic battle. But the worst aspect of the movie lies on the script, being very straightforward and delivering some obvious plot holes. An example of it is how the lovebirds learns to understand each other by listening with their hearts. For a film striving to be realistic, such a plot hole is laughable. But the worst example lies in the ending. While the ambition of giving a tragic ending is admirable and the ending is an emotionally heart-wrenching moment, it could have been more hopeless and less contrived (yes, the historical Smith was sent back to England, but there is possibility that he would have died during the voyage).Besides that, ""Pocahontas"" remains one of my favorites and it is a good movie on it's own merits. It does have some obvious flaws, but it's strengths excels. It is a movie that I'm not ashamed to say that I enjoy and it is a movie that deserves to be appreciated.",Pocahontas

143,Princess5363,A Beautiful Story,10,8 February 2003,"Alright, yes this isn't the true story of Pocahontas, but why would Disney make a movie about what really happened?  Disney patched it up to make it more appropriate for the audience, just the way it has in other stories.  The original story of The Little Mermaid has Ariel's character kill herself in the end because her prince marries someone else.  Disney doesn't ""do"" that crap so stop whining about Disney not including the little part about John Smith raping Pocahontas, etc.  As for this movie, by far my favorite aspect of this movie was the art.  The wind blowing the leaves, the mist over the water, everything like that far outweighs any other Disney movie prior to that.  Sure this movie didn't exactly have a ""happily ever after"" ending, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  The songs were beautiful and the connection between John Smith and Pocahontas is far more stronger than any other leading characters in a Disney movie.  This story has a moral to it and it leaves you thinking afterward.   I'm sorry there were no songs like ""Under the Sea"" or ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"" but this story is a lot more deeper than that. And I disagree with the guy who said the songs took away from the story.  If anything, they enhanced it.  If you want something simple, go rent the Power Puff Girls movie-- if you're mature enough to want something more, then rent this movie.  (10/10)",Pocahontas

145,BenD25,Pocahontas,10,16 September 2010,"Every family has a black sheep. You know, the one who never really fit in and always gets criticized. And the ""Disney Animated Classics"" canon is no exception. The black sheep in this family? Pocahontas. Not because it wasn't profitable (there have been far less successful Disney classics) or accomplished enough. So, the real reason? The Lion King. No film could have been a worthy follow-up to ""The Lion King"" Disney was on a roll between ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Lion King"", and it was inevitable that the next film would be a ""let-down"" because it doesn't get any bigger than ""Lion King"". So Pocahontas had to be scrutinized on how it compared to its predecessor's box-office gross, soundtrack sales, video revenues and what not. All that, instead of being appreciated for what it is: a NEW movie. A DIFFERENT direction. A DIFFERENT style. The film is a majestic piece of work, despite its flaws. It has a stylized artwork reminiscent of ""Sleeping Beauty"". The drawing is very angular and the mostly turquoise backgrounds are imbued by the characters' warm look. The music is good, especially ""Colors of the Wind"" and ""Mine, Mine, Mine"". It's not as memorable as in the Menken/Ashman movies but it's still beautiful. The film's main flaw is in its storyline. Disney should have used the idea of an Indian princess falling in love with an English settler without naming them Pocahontas and John Smith and claiming it to be ""based on true events"". Aside from that, it should be enjoyed for what it is. It deserves more than a 6.0 rating. Maybe with time, people would realize its true beauty and learn to love it.",Pocahontas
146,junemo,Stunningly beautiful!,7,6 November 2019,"This movie is stunningly romantic, which is very rare for an animated movie. I can watch that waterfall scene where John Smith first meets Pocahontas over and over again, it's so beautiful. While much of this film is wonderful visually, due to the adult content and a few violent scenes, it may be better suited for older kids and adults. Although some may not like this film because it isn't like other Disney movies that were more successful financially, or that it's historically inaccurate, to me it's just a simple love story. I think the filmmakers strived to bring about a sensitive story involving a Native American and a man from another world who fall in love with each other, in spite of their differing backgrounds. This was Disney's first interracial love story, which made over $300 million and won two Oscars, so it's hardly a failure. No, it's not historically accurate, but it doesn't need to be. If you like romantic movies, simply enjoy the beautiful animation, lovely tunes, and hopeful ending.",Pocahontas
147,MyAriel,"""So...serious.""...-The only Disney cartoon feature that gives me a melancholy feeling",8,11 September 2007,"This past Sunday I saw 'Pocahontas' again on video (yes people, I still do not have the DVD) after many years. For some time I've just avoided this movie. The renewed acquaintance brought out the same melancholy feelings as 12 years ago when I saw it in the cinema the first time. I've always been a sucker for Disney animation and this remained so as I grew up. I was exited about the 'second flowering' of Disney that began with ""Little Mermaid"" and I really looked forward to Pocahontas at the time. Looked to me that Disney were exploring new grounds again.But in 1995 I was of the verge of a depression and seeing ""Pocahontas'worked as a trigger for that. Mind: I liked the heroine, the animation, the music and -what I felt- the chemistry between the leads. But it was also a heavy-handed, toxic-serious-content movie, and did not at all give me that uplifting feeling that Disney cartoons usually give me. It is not merely because of the not-so-happy ending (actually I applaud a break from the 'formula', a bold move) but the fact remains that, after all, Pocahontas and John Smith were historical characters, and it is hard to put that out of my head while seeing this straightforward 'Romeo-and Juliet'story 'inspired by' actual events. The notion that the fragile peace between colonist and Indians, owing to Pocahontas, was only short-lived, gives a melancholy feeling of sorrowful regret"" as a reviewer (I believe from Variety.com) remarked. Still I like the movie for what it is, and I applaud the Disney studios for trying to break away from the usual 'safe and tried' fare. ""Pocanhontas' was not the kind of film that most people expected or wanted from Disney, and it is no surprise that it got many hostile reviews and that it divided the critics. I could also point out the weak points -plot holes- in the story, but lots of reviewers have done that before me. Suffice to so say that I found the reason to send John Smith back to England quite absurd. Would it really benefit the health of a badly wounded man to be at a ship at often rough ocean for four months? I think not! -------- additional remarks (16 Nov. 2007):I have purchased the SE DVD now and I must say I'm happy that they put the song ""If I never knew you"" back in the movie. A little word also for the zealot historians and others who trash this movie because it is not exactly an actual historical account and thus accuse Disney of misinforming people. I think that anyone watching Disney's 'Pocahontas' and thinking afterwards ""Oh, this is how it all really happened"", must be either a small kid or very stupid. If the songs don't give you a clue that it's nothing more than 'inspired by', the talking tree might do the trick. Anyway, who are the historians to accuse Disney of confusing people about the truth if they themselves cannot agree on whether the real capt. John Smith was truthful in his accounts of his adventures in Virginia? Think about that!",Pocahontas

However for an adult, you can also see it as educative not historically, but in the lessons of prejudice and violence. The critics who say the film is racist are idiots, because the film favours both races, as both don't want to fight except for one or two individuals which represent those in society who try to disrupt peace. The way i viewed was that it is a very funny film, and i think all adults will be humoured by the way John Smith is supposed to be good looking and his macho-arrogance. Also the way Pocahontas is the only attractive girl Captain Radcliffe.Don't sit to watch this film expecting a historical account of the English colonising America, watch it a for a barrel of laughs and Disney does not disappoint!So! The film stars very cleverly with a 19600 style painting which turns into a real scene of a ship setting sail for the new world, accompanied by a simple song which sets the tone of the period. Here we meet the villain Radcliffe and the hero John Smith ( voiced brilliantly by Mel Gibson). Already you will laugh at the way Smith effortlessly swings around on the ship ropes with total ease and showing off his strength. But wait it gets funnier, the ship gets caught in a storm half way across the Atlantic, and the weakest sailor Tom ( voiced by Batman Christian Bale) falls overboard. And who saves the day? JOHN SMITH! Yes the hunk himself dives miles into the sky, plunging into an angry ocean of epic waves, and saves pathetic Tom!! I know it isn't supposed to be realistic, but you've gotta laugh. Plus Smith's mane blonde hair that looks like a dodgy wig and penetrating blue eyes, ( clearly trying to go for the Paul Newman good looks here). Nevertheless an action packed start!This is where the genius of Disney's animators, editors and composer ( Alan Menken) come through, for after the horrendous noise of the storm and the dramatic saving of Tom, it all disappears into a fog, silence, the fog lifts to reveal a calm, warm shore with still blue waters and tall green trees, accompanied by a slow beating drum ( mystery as to what lurks on this land). Then comes a choir of tribes people singing a tribal song. We are immediately now transported from the greys, and the noise of the modern world, to the vibrant colours and tranquility of the undiscovered world. From here on, the film is a real credit to it's makers.Pocahontas is a beautiful woman, with long jet black hair, a gazelle-like figure, and a good spirit. You immediately like her not just because of her beauty but at her determination to improve relations between both worlds. What she sees in John Smith, lord knows lol!! John Smith is totally mesmerised by the dark beauty, and though at first we may not like him, his love for Pocahontas changes our minds. Other characters like Powhatan, Grand mother Willow, Nikoma and the animals all add a depth to the story and really contribute to an atmosphere of spirits ( Pocahontas' mother in the movie is actually the wind). The star of this movie however is without a doubt the score composed by the ever-so talented Alan Menken. Songs like "" Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""Colours of the Wind"" are worthy of any other great Disney song, and ""Savages"" is an intense number, which shows the collision of two hates, with flame and smoke symbolising warfare, and the end of the new world with the colonisation of the modern world. The best song in the movie is the one played during the End Cred its, ""If I Never Knew You"", a truly beautiful love song that captures the essence of the film and the love between Poc and Smith. All in all, this is a very underrated movie, one of Disney's finest, with a good moral message in it as well, it is a must-see for all children out there. As for us adults, it's educative to us too, but more so, it makes you giggle. WATCH OUT! The Special Edition DVD almost ruins the film, as they integrate the song If I Never Knew You into the film. Unlike with Beauty and the Beast where they composed a completely new scene, animators put it into two very intense. moving and important scenes. Both where Pocahontas speaks to Smith in the tent where he is imprisoned, and her final farewell to him at the end of the film, have them both singing this song. It overcheeses the love ridiculously, and to have Smith singing ""... I'd have lived my whole life throoooooooooough"", with this never ending note, when he is practically dying of a gun-shot wound is just stupid and ruins it for all of us who love the original.So I advice to buy the one-disc DVD with the original, and not the two-disc special edition which ruins the movie.",Pocahontas
152,ivybustamante,My favourite Disney film and always will be.,10,15 October 2018,Sure it has flaws but I love the story! Nothing but love for this film. You need to check out Anastasia too! Apparently not by Disney but who cares when it's good!,Pocahontas
153,zakwaripop,perhaps the most important Disney animated feature!,8,27 July 2013,"I really loved the music and how it moved... the orchestrations were very smart and at moments complex (polyphony) and the lyrics really contributed to the story's very serious undertone. The portrayal of Native Americans in the media has always been (and justly so) a sensitive subject but I am happy to report that it appears this movie has done it with great taste and respect for the culture. The animation is great and certain sequences (most notably ""Colors of the Wind"" are just masterful.I could actually feel the wind at the end! A great watch! An important film... not a popcorn Disney (like some recent ones) Bravo!",Pocahontas
154,Eveningstarz_4,"Amazing music and visual art, horrible accuracy",6,6 March 2008,"First off, I will say that Pocohantas is one of my absolute favorite Disney movies. I love the music, the setting, and the Grandmother Willow/river/mountain top scenes. Disney's portrayal of the story of Pocohantas is very, very roughly accurate, if they were trying to be accurate at all. Yes, in real life, Pocohantas did save John Smith's life from her father. But it was definitely not as drawn out as Disney shows. There was never a romance between Pocohantas and John Smith. While John Smith did have to go back to London due to an injury involving gun powder, he was never shot by Governor Ratcliffe or any of the settlers. There was simply an accident with gun powder. Pocohantas did not meet John Smith until he was almost killed by Powhattan. Afterward, John Smith was able to talk with Powhattan, and he and Pocohantas remained friends. Just friends, nothing more. Disney's Pocohantas is probably one of the very few where I can say that I prefer the sequel as far as accuracy goes, but I won't go into details about Pocohantas 2. In conclusion, this movie is great for an introduction to Pocohantas, but children should learn the true story soon afterward, if not before seeing this movie.",Pocahontas
155,saxguygb,Good Movie with Great Animation,7,15 September 2015,"I never saw this movie as a kid, mainly because I thought it would too girly and/or boring. I had read reviews that were positive and mixed. Eventually, I decided to watch it and I don't think it's as bad as others might make it out to be.The best thing this movie has going for it is the animation. The drawing style seems to stand out from some of the previous Disney movies that came out before it. The backgrounds are beautiful to look at, especially the nature ones and the characters are pretty well- drawn too.Some of the songs are pretty good. My two favourites are ""Just Around The Riverbend"" and ""Colors of The Wind"" (both the movie version and the cover version by Vanessa Williams). The other songs are good, but I just like these two the most. This is the only movie I know of where Mel Gibson sings and is surprisingly really good.Pocahontas is a decent Disney female lead character. There's not a whole lot new to her compared to some of the other Disney female characters prior to her, but she's beautiful to look at and she's interesting enough that she's not much of a bore.The rest of the human characters are okay, but again, there's nothing really too special about them, including John Smith and the villain, Governor Ratcliffe.My favourite character is Meeko, the raccoon that usually stays near Pocahontas. I love how he changes expression so quickly and looks so cute doing it. He's also delightfully mischievous, giving Percy (Ratcliffe's dog) and Flit, the hummingbird. The scenes with these animal characters are pretty funny and enjoyable to watch.I'm not very familiar with the story of the real Pocahontas and I know this film gets criticized for its historical inaccuracies. The only inaccuracy I know about is that Pocahontas was about 11 or 12 years old when she met John Smith who was in his late 20's or early 30's at the time. The movie has Pocahontas as a woman in her late teens or early 20's for obvious reasons.Overall, I think Pocahontas is a pretty good Disney animated movie. I'm glad I saw it and I see both the good and bad of this film. It does have a slow pace at times and doesn't quite have the level of energy and fun that some of the other Disney films before it had, but it's still pretty good and I definitely will continue to re- watch it for years to come.",Pocahontas
156,paulinho_riviera,The most underrated Disney classic,9,5 November 2018,"With stunning, and i mean STUNNING animation, one of the top 3 Disney soundtracks of all time and a touching story (despite its flaws on characterization), Pocahontas is a mesmerizing movie that should make you think about what is really valuable in life and how much better human beings we could be. Especially fitting in today's context, with the rise of xenophoby and intolerance in our society.I'll just talk a bit more about some of the songs, because they completely deserve every praise they can get""Just Around the Riverbend"" - A beautiful song about taking a leap of faith, saying that we need to risk more and not stay in our comfort zone if we want to see what's around the ""riverbend"".""Colors of the Wind"" - My favorite song in the movie, and probably my all-time favorite Disney song (I'll Make a man out of you from Mulan is a contender though), this masterpiece is about how we should try and see what's really valuable to us, that wealth isn't everything and we need to learn how to respect nature, other people and our surroundings, and how many things we may take for granted in our daily life, without paying attention to them.""Savages"" - Probably my favorite scene in the movie, a song that shows that everyone in a war is in the wrong, that by dehumanizing others we're only dehumanizing ourselves and on the other side of every war all we have are flawed humans, just like us.This just isn't a 10/10 because the villain is a bit unimpressive, but this movie deserves a lot more love than it gets. Definitely a must watch.We're all savages :)",Pocahontas
157,amyevans4590,powerful love story!!,8,13 April 2006,"I have to admit, when this came out when i was 5, it wasn't one of my favourite Disney films... least i don't remember it being.But recently, I've been watching all my Disney films again (a way to get away from GCSEs meh!) and Pocahontas just got me!! I loooved it!! The songs were stuck in my head for ages. And the love between Pocahontas and John Smith just aah!! Sooo romantic. The line ""Pocahontas, id rather die tomorrow, than live 100 years without knowing you"" is one of the most beautiful quotes I've ever heard. The ending is so sad tho, most Disney films they live happily ever after, but john smith has to go back to Britain. Its very sad :(I really do believe this film is probably the most beautiful Disney film there ever was. Its weird, now that I'm older, i understand it more, so maybe thats why it wasn't one of my favourites when i was a kid, because i didn't understand the love, the history.However I BEG OF YOU!! if you love this film, PLEASE do not watch the sequel. It will ruin it for you, i promise.",Pocahontas

The music was incredibly annoying and...I HATED this Disney movie. Super disappointed considering I was dying to watch it when I did. I hope if it's made into a live action remake, that it's better. 
I wish they would play something else on freeform than this piece of crap movie",Pocahontas

161,cjd-16,"This movie has some slight flaws, but it is magical.",8,25 April 2007,"This is by far the most under-rated Disney movie of all time. Sure it wasn't perfect, but it is MUCH better than a 5.6.The story is absolutely engrossing. There are so many good and realistic things going on... a man learning about all the little things he has missed in life, an Indian princess striving for adventure and guidance amongst her steady and safe society, and a full-blown war between civilizations who both believe that the other is made of savages. I appreciate that this story is a realistic depiction of war, with two disagreeing sides, neither of which is necessarily right or wrong.The animation in this movie is absolutely spectacular. And it is spectacular in the best way: with a basis in cinematography. The animation is not only spectacular because of the details in the backgrounds and the characters, but even more so because of how beautifully it is used. Scenes such as when Pocahontas and John meet in the mist are the kind of simple beauty that more movies need. When you hear the song ""Listen With Your Heart"", you can practically feel the breath of the surrounding forest. Fantastic stuff.Another big high point is the music. Everyone's heard the show-stopping ""Colors of the Wind"", but the others are worthy of praise as well. ""Steady as the Beating Drum"", ""Just Around the River Bend"", ""Savages"", ""Listen With Your Heart"", ""Mine, Mine, Mine"", and the deleted ""If I Never Knew You"" ALL fit perfectly. Musically, this movie is on par with Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and just a tick behind ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"".So if all these things are good, why only an 8? Two words... the ending. Everything leading up to it is so engrossing, and ""Savages"" builds up such an intense conflict drama, and everything is falling apart. This was the chance for Disney to turn this movie into a classic, and with what had to happen, they easily could have. But they completely failed. After ""Savages"", the scene that should have been the most intense and dramatic climax in their history ended almost instantly. It was too fast, there was almost no drama like their should have been, and the dialog was awful... captured none of the epic feel that it should have. Such a shame that such a great film was wrecked by such a horribly executed ending.I also wasn't a fan of the constant distractions of the animal sidekicks, and of course there are the matters of historical accuracy and non-stereotypical depiction of the Indians, but as an avid animation fan I was willing to overlook these issues and give it a chance to be a good film in a non-contexted world. Some may be put off by this, but since when have animated films been historically accurate? So, honestly, those who are put off by things like ""People in the dynasty when Mulan lived weren't praying to ancestors yet"" should probably not expect to like this movie.Out-of-context, I give it an 8/10 because everything up till the ending was completely magical, and had some of the best moments in all of Disney history, but the ending fell flat. I still want to watch it over and over again, because the rest of the movie really was fantastic. With a proper dramatic ending, I really do think that it could have been nominated for ""Best Picture"" like the Disney people thought it would. As is, it's a great entry into the animated classics canon. Definitely recommended even though it falls well short of the greatness achieved by the early 90's films.",Pocahontas
162,PMB-4,Animated epic narrative,9,16 February 1999,"What will happen when British fortune hunters in the period of colonization arrive in the New World and are faced with ""wild and fierce"" Indians? ""Pocahontas"" wants to give the answer to this question. It shows two totally different worlds opposing each other, and misunderstanding on both sides - concerning language and ideology.The Indians in this movie are not described as the bad ones, but the Whites are not the good ones either.Both groups comprise sinister characters as well as such characters that walk through their world with open eyes and without any prejudice.On the Indians' side, this character, of course, is the chief's daughter Pocahontas, who falls in love with the British captain John Smith. And this captain,in my opinion, is the most interesting characters of all in this movie. How he changes from a man who doesn't care much about the ""wild"" to an enlightened person makes the movie some epic narrative, a work also for adults.The fact that it's not only a story for children is strengthened by the animated violence shown here which is not characteristic for Walt Disney. For example, a young Indian is killed by British gun fire.One last word about the voice talents: Great work! I loved the different accents of the British. And by the way: Have a look at the faces of the characters. Never before have I seen such a perfect coordination of voices and mouth animations.",Pocahontas
163,TheWakingFalcoln,"WITH ""If I Never Knew You"": 10/10. WITHOUT: 6/10.",10,12 August 2006,"My review of this film will definitely be met with some disagreement due to its controversial consensus: that if the song, ""If I Never Knew You,"" had been in the movie as originally planned, this would be a masterpiece 10/10 film, and without (which is what happened), it is a 6/10 film.A little history, to explain this.At the end credits, there is a pop song entitled ""If I Never Knew You."" Although without research one would think that this is just a pop song meant to market the movie, that is not true. In fact, that song is based on a song that was originally in the movie, sung by Pocahontas (Judie Kuhn) and John Smith (A surprisingly mature-sounding Mel Gibson) on the night before his execution. The scene was cut because the test audience Disney used, consisting mostly of impatient youngsters, got restless during the song. So as not to seem uninviting to children, Disney cut the song. One would wonder why they did this considering that they wanted ""Pocahontas"" to have a more mature, more adult feel than their previous films anyway. They were literally hoping for a ""Best Picture"" nomination.So, without the song, what do we have? A film with superb animation, music, acting, dialogue, and characters, but a weak and unbelievable romance. This is crippling to the film because the romance is central to the story. The film is ABOUT that romance. I remember seeing this movie in its original cut, without the song, and thinking that the romance was stupid because it seemed weak. Why would Pocahontas be in love with some guy she met just a few hours ago and who, quite frankly, expressed curiosity in her culture more so than love towards her? This would be a good friendship, but not a good love because there's no emotion in it. The romance comes across as an obligatory, ""make-the-film-complete"" romance that many people feel has to be in every major Disney movie. The romance feels like it's there because it has to be, not because it's real. This earns the movie a less-than-stellar 6/10.With, ""If I Never Knew You,"" however, it is a whole different story. It is beautifully written, animated, and sung. It does not further the plot, but it definitely does further the emotion. One can definitely believe that Pocahontas and John Smith are in love, rather than forcing us to take their word for it. In this cut, there's also a reprise of the song at the very end before Smith leaves which echoes this love.At the end of the first version, my reaction was, ""meh."" At the end of the second version (the one that includes ""If I Never Knew You""), I was uncontrollably sobbing.I had cried over a film that I had known the lines to forward and back when I was younger, but never had an emotional reaction to. This song makes the movie feel much more complete, and I would even venture to call this Disney's best film if one includes the song. Some people, especially those who haven't heard the song, might think I'm overreacting, wondering what kind of difference a single song can make. I know I felt that way about people who said this before I viewed the second version. Trust me, watch the second version. It's like watching a different film. For that reason, my final grade for ""Pocahontas"" is 10/10.",Pocahontas
164,sugar_n_spice,After a nine-year absence...,8,20 November 2007,"... of watching this movie, I literally forgot everything about it.. except for ""Colors of the Wind."" So I was able to view it quite objectively.Okay, let's get one thing straight: this film is BY NO MEANS HISTORICALLY ACCURATE! Pocahontas wasn't a young woman when John Smith met her, but rather a young girl; she never fell in love with Captain Smith (there are some scholars who speculate on whether or not he actually tried to *rape* her); Pocahontas wasn't her real name, but a Hebrew nickname meaning ""playful one,"" given to her by the English (her real name was Matoaka); and I could go on and on about the history they got wrong in this movie. I suppose that, if I were an American Indian, perhaps I would be offended by this portrayal of Pocahontas, but since I'm a Euro-American with a very small part of American Indian (my great-great grandfather was a Blackfoot, adopted by an Irish family; and my great-great--uh, great?--grandmother was a Cherokee who walked the trail of tears), I can view this movie with less of a bias.The reason that I hadn't seen this movie in nine years was because, back when I was a little kid (I'm sixteen now), I cried. I was so used to Disney 'happy-endings' that I was saddened by the outcome of Pocahontas. And I refused to watch it ever again, so my mom sold it at the next garage sale. But after watching it now, I can appreciate how Pocahontas isn't Cinderella: she doesn't have a spare glass slipper so she can marry the prince; she's not Sleeping Beauty, who can just be kissed by her true love while she rests in ageless sleep; and she's not The Little Mermaid, whose fins are miraculously turned into human legs by her father so she can marry a human prince. Pocahontas and John SMith came from two very different worlds, ones that would fight for hundreds of years over the ownership of the ""New World."" I am glad, actually, that the ending isn't stereotypical Disney, but rather bittersweet and unforgettable. I love the fact that this is a Disney movie for emotionally mature audiences. I don't recommend it for children under thirteen.The music in this movie is amazing. ""Colors of the Wind"" won the Oscar, but I honestly think ""Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""If I Never Knew You"" are better! It's not just the wonderful melodies that add to the magic of Pocahontas, but also the deep, dark lyrics.I give this 8/10. Unfairly underrated.",Pocahontas
165,luizpaulon,And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon...,10,14 October 2007,"What can I say... When I was a kid, I didn't like Pocahontas. In fact, I was disappointed with this movie. Because, to me, they HAD to be happy ever after! The years have passed, and I'm 19, and I felt really stupid because I didn't like this movie. Oh my god. This movie wasn't made for children, It was made for grow ups. It's language... a child would never understand the message. A child would just enjoy the animation, Meeko and the songs. When I saw that movie again, 2 years ago, I understood why they couldn't be together, I understood the message of the songs and I understood the fact that this movie is one of the most brilliants animations crated. When I saw ""Colors of the wind"" I cried. When I heard ""Savages!"" I got chills. How Disney did that? Kids, don't watch this movie. Grow-ups, GO NOW AND WATCH.

166,goodkarma2,One of Disney's most beautiful artworks,10,8 February 2004,"I've fallen in love with that movie on the first time I saw it. The musical score is one of the best (if not THE best) ever seen on a Disney movie. The tale is not about the real Pocahontas, but rather about a Native American woman who shows the English settlers that there's more to life than just exploiting nature for their own benefit. The spiritual tone of this movie is certainly an aspect some people dislike, but that was the reason I thought Pocahontas was something special. She is talking to a tree, her best friends are animals - so we actually believe every single word she sings in Color of the Wind to make John Smith understand why he's on the wrong path.It's just a pity they cut the love song If I Never Knew You. Should Disney ever release a Special Edition DVD they could finish the scene, because it would really give the finishing touch to the story.Concerning those bad reviews about Pocahontas not being historically accurate, all I can tell you is, please don't force your children to watch things that show historical facts the way they were. It's the most important aspect of those Disney movies that they use stories people know and alter them in a way to give children (and adults) something to think about. Their movies wouldn't be this touching had they used completely new stories or the original stories (hunchback of notre Dame, The Little Mermaid). For example, here in Europe, Pocahontas is a totally unknown name. When I watched this movie as a 12 year old I assumed they had made up the story completely. So it should be a good thing that I went to read who Pocahontas really was. It's the same with Hercules, after I saw that movie I went to read Greek mythology. Disney has (or should I say had, since their recent projects are not like they were in the 90s) the precious gift of focussing the people interests towards the topics of their movies. I'll always appreciate this when I see one of their masterpieces.",Pocahontas
167,mid-levels,Absolute Rubbish,1,27 April 2006,"The historical facts are that John Smith and Pocahontas never had any kind of romantic affair and in fact she married a white man named Rolfe. There is absolutely no mention of a romance between the two in any primary source of the time. See Smith's ""A Generall Historie"" from 1624 for the most complete primary account. The myth of a romance was a creation of romance writers who felt the need to narrativize the relationship between the two into something that would sell. In reality, she was an ambassador for her people and even traveled to England to meet the queen, with Rolfe. So if Disney and the like want to make some movie about a white guy and native woman in love-great go for it-but that is no reason to distort history for our kids, whose parents are most likely not informed enough themselves to contradict the movie.",Pocahontas
168,ssoracoe,The Hunt for the Real Story of Pocahontas,6,23 February 2001,"Pocahontas directed by Michael Gabriel presents a fictionalized chronicle of the arrival of the English settlers in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607.  Led by the greedy, bombastic Governor Ratcliffe (voice of David Ogden Stiers) and Captain John Smith (voice of Mel Gibson), the explorers have come to the New World in search of gold.  They promptly begin cutting down trees, digging holes, and preparing to kill Indians.  Meanwhile, a young woman, Pocahontas (voice of Irene Bedard), observers the newcomers with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation.  Her father, Chief Powhatan (Russel Means), is certain that the landing of the white men means war.  The only hope to avert a battle between the Indians and English settlers arises out of the romance that develops between John Smith and Pocahontas.Anyone who expects historical accuracy from a Disney animated film should be ashamed of themselves.  In reality, Pocahontas was a 12-year old girl with over 100 siblings from her father's many marriages as chief of the Powhatan Indians.  She had a break with her father and moved to another village when she was 14 where she is rumored to have married the Kokwam from the movie. Pocahontas was captured and held in captivity by the English for ransom, which was never paid in full.  She was moved to another English settlement where she fell in love with another Englishman, John Rolfe, whom she married in a peacemaking marriage between the Indians and English.  Rolfe converted Pocahontas to Christianity and he went with her back to England where she was honored and met the king and queen. Sadly, though she died in England before she could return back to America.  Furthermore, John Smith in real life was a bit of a professional adventurer as he had endured many escalades in the Mediterranean where he was captured as a soldier. He was then forced into slavery, which he escaped from and traveled all over Europe to return home to England.  He was the only man to come over to America actually on three ships that had any real leadership experience, as the other men on the voyage were noble gentlemen. Smith whose stories were known to be a little sketchy at best alledgedly was scouting the land outside Jamestown when Indians captured him.  Smith awed the Indians with a compass he had with him and was depicted in the movie as the spinning arrow in Pocahontas' dream. Nonetheless, Powhattan imprisoned Smith for some time before sentincing him to death.  Then according to Smith as he was about to be struck by the ball over the head as shown in the movie Pocahontas jumped on top of him and pled with her father to spare Smith.  Yet, there never was any emotional relationship between the two as was falsely depicted in the movie.  Smith did go on to become a sort of adopted son to Powhattan after his capture until on another scouting mission his gun powder exploded in his pocket forcing him to return home to England for treatment.  In the film, the material culture was fairly well done.  The Indian village was recreated fairly accurately with the depiction of the longhouses but a log wall that surrounded the village failed to be portrayed.  In the summer the Powhatan would live in wigwams, which were left out of the movie.  The clothing of the English was accurate, as were the loincloths and moccasins of the Indian men.  However, the Indian women did not wear tops to their dresses as shown in the film.  The natives did possess primitive tattooing techiques but not advanced ehough to make patterns like the one seen on Pocahontas' arm and were more likely to paint their bodies.  In addition to the bows seen in the film, the Indians possessed spears, tomahawks, and small knives for weapons. As shown in the movie, there were dug out canoes in Indian society but most of the fishing was done with nets not spears.  The English at Jamestown had basic shovels, axes, and picks as seen but no wheelbarrels.  The ignition system of the matchlock guns used by the English was well portrayed yet the lack of accuracy of these guns was not shown.  The Indians were in fact leery of the English when they arrived and did initially skirmish with the white men as shown in the movie.  The Indians' concept of property as communal and the white's as personal was depicted as well.  Furthermore, lacosse was played by the Indians but not the version shown in the movie as the games were huge spanning several miles at a time.
A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Pocahontas as the need for tolerance between those of different races and cultures is evident throughout the film.  The director, Michael Gabriel, shows this by initially having the English and the Indians, who are from very different cultural and ethic backgrounds skirmish and prepare for battle.  Yet, he has John Smith and Pocahontas unite these two different cultures together.  They show how misconceptions or ignorence about the other culture caused this amnimosity, which once they actually interacted with each other was nowhere to be found. In addition, this film is a reflection of the values of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a more accurate and politically correct representation of Native Americans in the film.  The character of Pocahontas was physically modeled after Irene Bedard, a woman with Indian heritage who also did the speaking voice of Pocahontas.  In addition, Native American activist Russel Means did the voice of Chief Powhatan.  This was done in part to assure the support of Native Americans who could have protested and made a big to do over the changing of the actual story, which the moviemakers did not want to occur.Technically the film is very sound.  It uses visually creative techniques in its animation that are leading the way for the movie industry.  The scenery, which may have been a bit exaggerated in its depiction of Jamestown, Virginia, is beautiful, as are all the characters in this full-length animated color film.  The music by Alan Menken throughout the movie is electrifying in greatly adding to the overall experience.
All in all, Pocahontas is an enjoyable viewing experinece that I would recommend to both kids and adults.  The question about the movie lingers whether the lack of a happily ever after ending will hurt the movie in the eyes of audiences.  Pocahontas is sure to entertain viewers and hopefully by transporting both kids and parents alike to another time and place will inspire children to learn the actual history of this legendary story and their parents to teach them the real account.",Pocahontas
169,Bbfvet,"Love it, wish it was 100% true",9,5 July 2008,I love Pocohontas. My mom buys all the CLASSIC Disney movies when they come out on DVD and I recently watched Pocohontas with my 5 year old little sister. I fell in love all over again. One of the things i adore about the movie is that the love between Poco and John SMith is so REAL. It's not just acting but it seems as if they were real actors well-acting! in a room together! I wanna cry when i see John Smith and Pocohontas part at the end! And i HATE how in the sequel they don't get back together either. (Take that all you people who say the story wasn't realistic-it is in a way!) And it makes me somehow dream if the real Pocohontas and John SMith had a forbidden love....,Pocahontas
170,naomielsanders,Underrated,9,13 October 2013,"This film has been said to be the snowflake that caused the avalanche of the Disney movies. LAME WORDS! This movie is amazing! Recently watched it again and it brought back soo many good memories.First, I think that Pocahontas is a great Disney Princess. She's fun and free-spirited, but also serious and strong. Shame that she's the least popular with the fans of the franchise. I think the reason is that she doesn't end up with John Smith at the end.Second, even though it's not politically correct, it's a great fiction story and strong, even with it being Disney-fied.Last, the songs are amazing! I love them, best being Colours of the Wind! On the whole, I love it. Great cast, great songs and great telling of a famous story. My only problems is that Radcliffe is pretty forgettable as a villain and that, in a film where the tree talks, wouldn't it make sense for the animals to talk as well? But I'm judging it too much. Love it, Love it, LOVE IT! And remember ""If you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew""!",Pocahontas
171,Lailinia,"An Amazing, Underrated Masterpiece",10,31 January 2013,"Pocahontas is an amazing movie. I honestly don't think I'd be who I am today with out it. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. The animation's beautiful, the songs are to die for, and the story is great. Yes, it doesn't follow the true story, but that wouldn't really make a good kid's movie, would it? It's a Disney movie, people. Disney. And I fail to see how it is racist, either. If anything, it is the complete embodiment of anti-racism.The story is about European exploration and relations with the Natives in America during the 1600s. We watch as the heroic Captain John Smith travels on a ship with the greedy Governor Ratcliffe across the fierce Atlantic waves to the Virginian Coast, where they set up camp in search of gold. Not to far away is a Native village, where we meet Pocahontas and her friends and family. At some point later, John and Pocahontas meet by a waterfall. Taken by surprise, John crouches low, and prepares to shoot the princess, but stops after she looks at him very majestically and commandingly (not in a mean way, just like ""you will not hurt me""). This starts an unsuspecting romance between the two, and eventually causes the Natives and the Europeans to clash, because each think the other are savages. Pocahontas, with the help of Grandmother Willow, realizes that fighting must stop and she must follow her heart. She teaches John this through the beautiful and moving song ""Colors of the Wind"", my personal favorite Disney song of all time. A terrific battle scene ensues, accompanied by ""Drums of War."" I won't give away any more.But does this really sound racist to you? This movie is about stopping racism and prejudice, how love can overcome any obstacle. HOW THE HECK IS THAT RACIST?????? People are also saying it's an overdone storyline, but the only movie I can think of right now that has the same basis would be Last of the Mohicans, which is hardly a children's film. And, anyway, doesn't everything get a little repetitive these days? I've also read some things that say this movie is sexist. Because Pocahontas apparently throws herself and John or something. So basically, wouldn't every other princess movie (with the exception of Beauty and the Beast or maybe Aladdin) be the same way? Don't all of the princesses pretty much throw themselves at their princes? Back to Pocahontas, this movie is my childhood. I remember watching it when I was little, I was obsessed. I would call knots in trees Grandmother Willow, laughed at Meeko and Flick, I sang and danced to the songs. And now, a fourteen year old, Pocahontas remains one of my favorite movies. Honestly, we need more movies like it. Killing has become so popular these days, and now we've lost sight of the importance of peace and love in the world. I know, I sound very cheesy, but it's true. I wonder if everyone in the world, right now, watched Pocahontas right now they might think twice before polluting or killing.I think Pocahontas is great for both kids and adults. All though the message may be a little deep for kids to wrap their minds around, they'll love the animation, animals, songs, and action. Maybe they'll even have some understanding of what's really happening. Adults would enjoy again the animation and the surprising maturity of the plot, and of course, the music as well.This movie is a must-see for children and adults alike, even if it is a ""kid's movie"". I know I'll be showing my kids when I'm older!!!",Pocahontas
172,annebush,awesome movie!,9,15 April 2014,"I cannot believe people fuss over this movie. To me, it's just about perfect! Yes, Pocahontas did not just ""learn"" English like ""that"", but guess what? This movie is meant to uplift little girls, not to educate them! It's inspirational, that's what. Even though it still has that princess romance, like, a lost,this is a great movie! To all the people who say its like, SO fake and fictional, darn am I disappointed in you! This movie is very loosely based on a historical event. No, John S. an Pocahontas never had romance of any sort, but this is still one of the best princess movies and at least should be a 8.3. This is and always will be one of those underrated Disney gems for the ages.",Pocahontas
173,Frollo,The trees... I like the trees,9,17 July 1999,"When I saw it for the first time in the theatre, I didn't like it. Compared with Aladdin and The Lion King, I found it slow and boring. But being a Disney fan and all, I had to buy the tape anyway, and that's when I really started to like the movie. The backgrounds are beautiful. I like the trees. Where I live, we don't have trees that tall. I found them impressing. And for the story... I'm not that familiar with American history, so I'd never heard of Pocahontas before. That's why I don't judge the story on historic accuracy, I simply consider it a beautiful Romeo & Juliet-like story. And after 4 or 5 viewings, I even started to appreciate the slow pace. If you'd asked me in 1995, I'd given it a 5 out of 10. Now, it's an 8.",Pocahontas
174,wapu,Factually Incorrect Movie Short,4,19 February 2001,"This film is perfect for my 1 and 2-Year-old daughters.

175,cfrafihbari,Girl who is responsible and with character,8,23 March 2013,"Most of the animation movies are about immature girl falling in love with a stranger from another place and then leaving with the crush into his own world. Although that's where the movies end, i am always curious about what would happen after the movie!! This is where i found the ending of the movie very good. it showed, she has character, leadership, strength and is caring for her people. Another aspect I liked was how she sneaked out, and he sneaked out, and both tried to keep it secret, it makes it more realistic.Also I liked the honesty in the movie, how even a sincere guy thinks the natives are savages, uncivilized, and how the captain came for gold, greed and land, and who wanted to wipe out the ""race"". Although in reality that is exactly what happened, in the movie, things turned out better. At least it made me believe and hope that may be something like this actually happened, somewhere in the world. Remember British did not just come to America, they did colonize practically the whole world.And overall the lesson is good, just because we are different does not mean the others are savages, or inhuman. Just because a group has more technology, does not make them civilized either. And there is more to life, nature, spirituality, the 4th dimension, than just materials and wealth. And ""sometimes the right thing to do is not always the easiest one"". Its a good watch, but its definitely not for children, its more for thinking adults!",Pocahontas
176,jamesolio,This was a film that was fine for its time.,8,8 April 2006,"Hmm...this film had good intentions in trying to make peace with the American Indians that we have wronged in the past. The environmental films such as this and Ferngully, the Last Rainforest in the early 1990s also created a sense of being at one with mother nature. This is laughable now as our economy is more important to keep strong. The music, as with most Disney full-length animated features, is great! Home on the Range is probably the last of these kind of films now that we're all buying into the computer animated age. Both types of animation have their strengths and weaknesses. The full-length animated features that Disney mastered ran from 1937 to 2004. All that is left seems to be sequels that Disney cranks out.Pocahontas, is indeed overlooked, but it's a period film and no longer is relevant to most of our complex technological culture. Young children under five may find this boring depending on their attention span. A hyperactive child, for example will scope this flick for approximately five minutes. Scooby-Doo cartoons or other fast-paced cartoon action with plenty of colors and happy, friendy characters that don't kill each other are for kids. Emporer's New Groove is a great Disney example for fast-paced fun and exciting times in front of the boob-tube.Animation: 10/10 Story: 7/10 Fun Factor: 8/10",Pocahontas
177,Warrior_Princess,"moving, imaginative and an animated gem",10,24 November 2005,"I loved this film from childhood, and still I only have to hear the music to me buzz inside!The plot is based on a (not too well known)true moving story about an Indian Chief's daughter and an English settler, trying to bring peace between their two different, but endearing worlds.In my opinion, this film is a Disney jewel, their best work ever, the likes of which we don't see any more. The film is comical, beautiful, moving and inspiring. It teaches children and adults alike about moral values and to create love not war. The evil Governor Radcliffe is a classic Disney villain, though not a truly terrifying as some are! His sidekick Higgins, and dog Percy bring the comic element to the film, and an amazing musical soundtrack makes this film a fantastic experience. Colours of the Wind particularly stands out as one of Disney's best songs and the film isn't as fairytale and clichéd as some animations are. Pocahontas is one of the better role models and her strong character modernises the film from a time when English women ere stifled. She is unafraid to speak out for what is right, no matter the consequence, but comes across an tough choice to make. With the help of Grandmother Willow, the magical Willow tree bringing a fantastical element to the film, as a wise guide to life, and Meeko & Flit her animal companions, we join Pocahontas on a magical quest for peace that should never be forgotten.To summarise, the film never gets tiring, the soundtrack is to be applauded and the language and morals are thought-provoking and moving. This film is not only for children, but deserves to be passed down through the generations as a piece of history.",Pocahontas
178,nataliedupille,My favourite movie of all time,10,15 April 2020,In my opinion Disney knocked it out of the park with this movie it was the first movie I saw in the cinema when I was little and since then always loved this movieIt's the first Disney movie that really spoke about a difficult subject of racial profiling and what happened to native Americans back then.The music is so powerful and beautiful not just colours of the wind which won awards for the beauty that it is but the melodies and the overture was stunning to.I cry at the end of this movie every single time and I'm 28 now haha it is powerful moving and visually stunning to look atBest movie ever !!!!!!!!!,Pocahontas
179,pavlinaarx,we are still the same,9,1 August 2017,"I really love movies about ""civilized"" people and ""savages"". I really love cartoons , fairy tales and Disney because you can completely relax while watching you know there will be happy end. There are no violence here which I hate. And which is the most important there is a morality:sometime easy understanding and simple as the good always win evil but sometimes as here there are more deep morality and need to hear unsaid to understand. I can not say much about the plot because there will be spoilers. It is (as expected) sweet, funny , even in some way deep, but sometimes....it did not hold water. And it is only one disadvantage of the film. But I love the plot because there are natural Americans that are completely different but just the same from Englishmen, there are gold rush, greed, the bloody war, and of course the love what breaks all difficulties. The plot is most important part of the cartoon as it must be. Vusuals, songs supplement the plot. The characters. The first main character is Pokahontas, native American girl who understand what the forest, the animals, the rocks are saying. She loves her tribe and want it to be peace. She is brave and wise , wants to find her purpose. The second main character is John Smith, the Englishman who goes to America ""for glory, God and gold and for Virginia company"" and for adventures of course. He allow the principle: shoot first, ask questions later.The Englishmans and natural Americans are just the same. Yes, they have different colors of skin, different languages and culture. Englishmans are more thirst for gold and natural Americans more loves nature, but they both want war to make marvelous deeds. So they simply did not want peace and who did not want never find. Them both thinks others are savages because they think otherwise. Conclusion: ""Pokahontas"" is a cartoon that I strongly recommend to watch for everyone. Everything are in measure, and there are philosophy. But sometimes plot becomes too absolute,too monochrome, and sometimes too pink. So my mark is solid nine.",Pocahontas

I was 4 years old leaving in an apartment in Waipahu when I noticed Pocahontas being played on Disney channel. What caught my eye at first was her hair. Pocahontas had some nice silky hair that I couldn't get enough of. My family members would tease me as a kid because I also had long silky hair. What also caught my eye as a kid was the picture. The graphics were good and it made the movie stand out more to me as a kid. As a kid, when I watched this movie, I thought it was super cool how she was connected to the environment and how she would treat the plants and animals with the same respect she would give to her friends and family. I thought the animals were funny. I thought the funny the relationship between the raccoon and the wood pecker was super funny. How they would dick around each other but still had love for each other was something I thought was very unique about their relationship. That's the kind of bond I share with my family. When I watched this movie, I began to treat nature and my environment with more respect. When I think about it, it kind of taught me not to bite the hand that feeds you. Because we get mostly everything from our environment, we should treat it with respect. I also was taught that everyone in this world is the same, there is no one on another level. We are one family and earth is our shared home that takes care of us. I guess learning all these things as a kid kind of shaped me to become the man I am today. I would say I have a big heart.

182,gjf-22476,Movie Review,10,13 March 2018,"One of my favorite movies is Tangled. I love Disney in general and tangled is one of my favorite movies from Disney. I love the story and the singing that goes along with it. I love Reponzels voice and how she sings in the movie. It's so beautiful I can't get over it. I love when Reponzel and Eugene did a duet. The lyrics just moved me. Like watching the movie I was able to put my self in their shoes like I was actually apart of the movie and for them to sing a duet to ""I see the light"" just made me feel I had a connection.
 Another movie that I consider one of my favorites is the first Ip Man. That movie was straight up legit. I'm interested in the Kung fu action and the movie had lots of it. This movie fell into my top 3 movie collection because it was moving. I was moved how he was a highly respected and rich man that became poor because of the war between China and Japan. His wife also didn't respect him as much because he was into fighting but she didn't like that. She felt that he cared too much for fighting and that he cared more about fighting than his family. But when it came down where her fought the general of Japan in a match and the wife realizing that this is the last time he may be alive and that what he's doing is for the people made her realize that she was selfish and arrived to his match watching getting shot and nearly being killed.
 Pocahontas definitely falls into my top 3. It was actually my favorite movie from when I was a kid, true story. The first time I watched Pocahontas was when I was 3 and I just fell in love. The singing, her shiny hair, everything about that movie was and still is perfect to me.
 
 I would say that the best movie out of my top 3 would be Pocahontas. Pocahontas is probably my favorite movie of all time. Although I have many movies that I like, Pocahontas is one of those movies that I absolute love. The first time I watched the movie was when I was a little boy.

There are so many bad reviews about this film and i did not find anything wrong with the film. Pocahontas has some of the greatest songs of all Disney films. The songs 'Just Around The Riverbend' and 'Colors Of The Wind' are the best Disney songs ever written and to listen to. Judy Kuhn who sings these 2 songs has an amazing voice when singing. The other songs in the film are just as good. This film is just as good as The Lion King, with catchy songs and superb animation.

While critics were complaining that characters seemed soulless or too simply drawn, I was dumbstruck and heartbroken by the stillness and emotional weight of the minimalistic art direction, pacing, character interactions. It seems the movie is gaining a new fan base since its release, which is more than deserved. For a special treat (and to really get an idea of how far these animators were pushing the boundaries) check out the 2nd disk on the 10th anniversary edition, the extras includes a side by side comparison of that beautiful first encounter between Pocahontas and John Smith. If you were nuts about it before, see it here in its original charcoal storyboard. AMAZING. the nuance is even more striking in black and white. the detail, even the reaction on the character's faces, heartbreaking. and it's a STORY BOARD.",Pocahontas
185,kagami101,One of Disney's Best,10,14 December 2006,"American audiences were not ready for this movie in 1995 and neither was Disney. Just on the bad reaction of some kids at a preview they chopped out the love duet ""If I Ever Knew You"" and tore the emotional core out of the second half of the film. Thankfully it was restored for the 2005 DVD release and SHOULD be in any future theatrical reissues.Yes, the movie is not horribly accurate to the historical facts as we know them and it is more like ""Romeo and Juliet"" than the real story, but it is so well told and the score and artwork are the best post-""Little Mermaid"" work that Disney has done.This is easily in the top 10 of the great Disney films and like ""Fantasia"" probably won't get the credit it deserves for another 10 to 20 years.",Pocahontas
186,ilovecheesycrackers,It is average,5,31 January 2007,"This movie colud be worse. It is not a favorite of mine. Because I do ont like the ways there are spirits. The story is very silly.

But he cannot sing. The music is good but some songs do not fitting in. I would like to say that I do not like that people say it is racist or historicly inaccurate. It is not racist.

Songs like "" Just Around the Riverbend"" and ""Colours of the Wind"" are worthy of any other great Disney song, and ""Savages"" is an intense number, which shows the collision of two hates, with flame and smoke symbolising warfare, and the end of the new world with the colonisation of the modern world. The best song in the movie is the one played during the End Cred its, ""If I Never Knew You"", a truly beautiful love song that captures the essence of the film and the love between Poc and Smith.All in all, this is a very underrated movie, one of Disney's finest, with a good moral message in it as well, it is a must-see for all children out there.

189,amreed8,Pocahontas,10,18 April 2010,"This movie is severely underrated. This was a box-office hit of 1995! It won 2 Oscars for the music and animation. Sure, the story was inaccurate. Most bio films are. Nevertheless, I especially loved the diversity theme and enjoyed showing Native Americans in a positive, humane light that they deserve in a cartoon. It's not just cowboys and ""indians"" and the cowboys are the heroes, of course. Pocahontas is a young woman who teaches John Smith her values on nature and falls in love. Although that's not true, she married John Rolfe in the so-so sequel. But, this is an extraordinary Disney film about The American princess who needed more appreciation. Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz were awesome with the music. Menken is my favorite movie composer and was bummed when I learned he was not scoring ""The Princess and the Frog"" (but Randy Newman's score was very Louisiana good, though!).

190,aphippo,Deserves More Recognotion,8,31 July 2005,"Released in 1995 'Pocahontas' will forever remain in the shadow of 'The Lion King', however it does deserve more credit than it gets. Not as strong story wise as its critically acclaimed Disney predecessors as 'Pocahontas' was Disney's first attempt at portraying a true story and one that is fundamentally very serious. Despite the obvious problem that the film has in providing genuine humour once again Alan Menken proves a sure fire hit in the music department this time teamed with Stephen Shwartz, together they produce a score filled with emotion. Overall 'Pocahontas' doesn't match the brilliance of 'The Little Mermaid', 'Beauty & The Beast', 'Aladdin' or 'The Lion King ' but deserves the title of a Disney Classic none the less. Not as child friendly as other Disney films, the doomed romance story line is more suited to an adult film but still proves to be compelling viewing and provides some extremely emotion felt and unforgettable scenes.",Pocahontas

Yet, it is unbelievable that people are complaining about historical accuracy in a Disney movie. I like the way Disney handled everything and gave it a more matute tone, compared to other films in their catalogue. Even though the plot is predictable, but it is still emotional and I literally cried at the end. The movie also carries important messages regarding respect and preservation of nature, even bringing awareness to ethnocentricity and how we can overcome it by being united. And of coarse the animation style is gorgeous! The music is also beautiful, and perhaps one of the best Disney soundtracks ever! In some of the scenes the music literally speaks for itself. Overall, I'll give it 10/10. The movie is underrated and certainly doesn't deserve the hate and low ratings. So in my opinion, it is truly a gem worth watching.",Pocahontas

The only redeeming points about this movie are the music, the relationship between Meeko, Percy, and Flick, and Christian Bale in yet another Disney film. Alan Menken and Steven Shwartz first pair was a great job, but I can't take the PC in this movie. Mel Gibson was great, I love David Ogden Stiers as Ratcliff, and of course I loved Meeko. Other than that, same your money and buy a better movie like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, or Cinderella.",Pocahontas
194,aditijainind,No relation to actual history,3,16 August 2016,"So, Briton John Smith with his crew and governor Ratcliffe arrive in America and start construction activities on an unclaimed piece of real estate (unclaimed, despite being so close to a Native American settlement.. seriously.) The chief of the Native American settlement is Powhatan and his daughter Pocahontas (engaged to be married to a brave of her tribe, Koccum) dreams of a more exciting life than what she thinks Koccum will give her. She comes into contact and falls in love with John Smith and the rest of the film focuses on the trials and tribulations of the lovers. First of all, the British settlers shown to be harmless and somewhat defensive and respectful of the Natives is a stretch of the imagination. It is not really a secret how the natives were relieved of their property by the settlers who had superior technology. It was an unofficial policy of British colonialism to passive-aggressively wipe out indigenous populations by over exploitation and not providing relief when famines resulted from this over exploitation. In fact they hated (and still hate) those peoples who somehow survived with their religion using tactics like over-reproduction. Secondly (possible spoiler), the claim that Indigenous Americans have been shown is good light is not true at all. Case in point: When Koccum sees Pocahontas and JS together, he all of a sudden goes all uncivilized and savage. He doesn't shrug and go away (Which he would have probably done because Native American women were said to be allowed to select their partners), he doesn't give a warning, he just yells and attacks with his ax. The entire proceedings are racist at a cringe - inducing level. Thirdly, they've shown that the crew mutinies against Ratcliffe and refuses to fire in the end because they come to know that there is a truce. The kind of decimation that was achieved (in actual history) in face of such insubordination is remarkable. Everyone knows it is natural that when civilizations first come into contact (and in this case it was just after the middle ages), they make more hate then love, but at least don't lie about it. This aggravates the injustice. Poor Ratcliffe (an actual historical person) also evokes sympathy, the blame for everything has been laid on him for no reason and his name is tarnished forever. He actually met a gruesome death at the hands of natives. The film itself is not very engaging. John Smith is blandly handsome. Pocahontas though exquisitely beautiful, doesn't have too many expressions and if you look closely, all the ladies of her tribe have the same face, with different hair. Even less can be said about the other characters of the film. The animals are cute. If you are watching this on TV you'll make frequent trips to the bathroom and to get snacks and cola. To be fair, how much can you get out of the done to death trope of Pocahontas throwing herself on JS to protect him. That said, Two scenes in this film are pure magic: when Pocahontas and Smith first meet and in the end when Pocahontas rushes to her ledge to get a better view of her lover's ship leaving. Music is also nice. The three stars are for that.",Pocahontas

196,AcornicopiaOFlove,Absolutely Amazing,10,24 May 2006,"I am sixteen years old, I recently pulled this film out of a box I found when moving. Remember, I was 5 when this film came out in England. My first reaction was...""wow"" I understand that Disney is well loved and when I was 5, this was just another favourite film, now I can safely say that it is my ultimate favourite film, there is so much depth that is just not obvious to a typical 5 year old.Like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" it shows serious in-depth prejudice, the British settlers do not want to associate with the Native Americans and vice-versa. The British settlers want to completely take over and change the Native American's way of life. The depth touches me emotionally and along with the love story in all the political controversy, i found myself sobbing as the lovers parted knowing that they were unlikely to see one-another again. I know I am sixteen and probably too old to enjoy Disney, but quite frankly, I could not care less.I watched this film with my sister-in-law as a 5 year old, the other day, we sat together and watched it again as a memoir of the ""old days"" again, we both sat in tears, it's just a pity that the sequel did not match up to the historical context!",Pocahontas

198,littlebitof_me,Movie of a lifetime,10,11 April 2006,"Wow! In 1995 I was only 3 years old but my parents bought me the video anyway. Over the past eleven years I've watched the movie on and off but a few days ago I came back to it. And now at 13, I've watched the movie at least five times in the last three days. Now I understand the story and it truly makes me cry. Also I've learnt all the words off by heart to 'Just around the river bend' and 'Colours if the wind.' My eleven and seven year old sisters don't see what about the film is so addictive and tear-jerking but you've really just got to watch it to find out. To be honest with you I just think that it is the best Disney film ever made. Many people disagree with me but we all have our personal preferences and this just happens to be mine",Pocahontas
199,wicklexpickle,Pocahontas,10,18 May 2006,"I've loved this film since the first time I saw it. It's magical, and does not show an anorexic helpless damsel like most other children's films. I love the music, and the ending is strong, and dose not really taper off with no thought. The voices in this movies go really well with the characters. The animation is stunning and this movie dose not really patronise children. Overall a lovable tale. I think I always will love this film. I can even remember going to see it at the cinema, all those years ago. One of Disney's best films. Absolutely one of my fave movies.",Pocahontas

201,beedoodle,Awesome! My favorite!,10,15 July 2006,"I love this movie! It is wonderfully sweet and fun filled. I was 3 when this movie came out and though I cannot remember going and seeing the movie, I remember the ride home. I used to think it was scary, most likely because of the villain, Ratcliffe. Ratcliffe is arrogant, mean, snooty, ruthless, sour, greedy, pompous, and bossy. NOt to mention fat! All he wanted was gold and to kill and destroy the Indians. Then, eight years ago when I was six or so, I watched it and fell in love with Pocahontas's story. I have seen many versions of this movie, but Disney's is by far my favorite. Disney creates a beautiful story of Pocahontas and John Smith's romance, though we don't know if it is true or not. This movie has wonderful characters, songs, scenes and it is overall wonderful. It is a must have for your collection! I'm 14 now and still love this movie. I always will. I think that Pocahontas is way better than any other Disney movie, though all of them are magical. In the movie, Pocahontas falls in love with John Smith, an explorer. John and Pocahontas have to meet secretly because if their own people found out, it would be highly discouraged and most likely dangerous. My favorite part is If I Never Knew You, a new song added in for the tenth birthday of the movie. It is a truly beautiful song and shows how much they loved each other. But the sunrise scene is moving as well. Even at the risk of her own life, Pocahontas saved John's life for a crime he didn't even commit. ANd that makes this movie. If only we could follow their ways. Then maybe, just maybe, we could all live in peace with the crisis in Israel, Iraq, N. Korea. Maybe if we all knew this story, the world be a better place, just as Pocahontas and John tried to make it.Watch this movie!",Pocahontas
202,ll-bugsy,let your kiddie side lose.,8,14 January 2007,"Since when does a film have to be historically accurate!!!!! Are you insane. this film doesn't even say Based on true events its a cartoon for crying out loud. Cut the producers some slack.When the film was first brought out in 1995 i thought it was superb. I mean the way they bought to races together with at first prejudice as the explorer's were apprehensive off an attack by as the called them ''savages'' then later ''love'' between John Smith and the heroine of the film Pocahontas, and the trials they face in order to keep there love secret and to prevent blood shed between the colonials and the Natives. I cried there i said it I was literally in tears at the end of this film. Although the Graphics could be better i recommend this to anyone who is easily swayed by love, and also to those people who still have a kid inside of them.",Pocahontas
203,Caramel_mami704,Refreshes Your Imagination,9,27 December 2001,"Many People before me not only cited, but complained about the fact that this movie was historically incorrect. But most forget that this movie was mainly targeted for children under the age of ten. Unlike Shrek and Monsters Inc. which tackles the task of entertaining both adults and children, Pocahontas was made for young girls. Yet many still complain of things being unrealistic and made for ""children with short attention spans."" This is the type of movie in which you are supposed to forget about reality, refresh imagination, and revive your child hood dreams. This movie is great to watch with your children, nieces, nephews, and younger brothers or sisters. Just sit back relax and watch with the amazement that a child would. Forget about the fact that it's not true to history there are plenty of other movies about Pocahontas to stay true to it. Live in the moment, wonder about how beautiful the music and scenery was, think like a kid!",Pocahontas
204,kelliabren,"Visually Entertaining, But Horribly Inaccurate",6,7 October 2008,"The animation is brilliant and vibrant- refreshing to both the eyes and the ears as the music also captivated the audiences.Children would find most of the characters in the movie to be fun and enjoyable, but need I mention that the exception is the loathsome Governor Ratcliffe with his greatly exaggerated ugliness and hatred towards Native Americans. There is something elegant yet subtly sensual in the way Pocahontas moves (or doesn't move). The audience would appreciate the oddly baby-faced John Smith, whom doesn't resemble his real historical counterpart much, but I guess they had to give him a face fit for the role of a ""heart throb"", with our current beauty standards to influence it. (But appearances is too minuet to consider it a major problem).The quality of dialog is comfortable. For the targeted audience, evidently 8-12 year-olds, it is very serious and dramatic. I'll hand it to the movie for having the characters deal with death, war, and discrimination that (while still existent) was clearly heavier during those times.The lesson of the movie is a good and clear one- that when it comes to culture and race, everyone should look past what they see (or what they think they see) and learn about the truths rather than believe the harsh myths about them. It is very important that children, as early as possible, learn that being different doesn't mean being bad. Different is what makes the world fun and interesting. Children may also come to the realization that greed, lust for power, and sheer ignorance never leads to anything positive for anyone.If you are finicky about historical facts in a movie, I'll forewarn you that this movie has enough inaccuracies to make it borderline fantasy. After writing an extensive report on Pocahontas back in the 5th grade, I was quite uncomfortable (I was in the 7th grade by the time it came out in theatres) The biggest and most obvious inaccuracy is the age of Pocahontas when she first met John Smith. In the movie she appears to be in her adult years, but in actuality she was only twelve. No factual documentation suggests her falling in love with John Smith, and thankfully so because the age gap between her and Smith was far too significant for such a union to be considered. The Disney film, like many others, greatly over exaggerated and romanticized actual history. At least in Pocahontas 2 they got it right when she married John Rolfe (Englishman and Virginia colonist that found success in the cultivation of tobacco.) While in England, she did indeed marry John Rolfe, but by then Ratcliffe had been dead for 3 years, thus being face to face the second time was impossible. Some viewers may be annoyed by Disney's constant need to add silly and magical characters when it comes to telling a story about real people and history to establish a balance in the film for young viewers to keep it from being too 'Scary' and/or 'Boring', even though Pocahontas's friends (Animal companions Meeko and Flit, and the enchanted tree spirit Grandmother Willow) don't seem to be annoyingly stupid. Lastly, many would agree that the language barrier could've been broken in a way better than magic enabling Pocahontas to speak English.Rating: 6/10",Pocahontas
205,Kletet,Disney magic.,8,22 July 2010,"I really can't describe this movie in words.At first I just really liked the film, but after I've watched it over ten times over I just can't hold my tears back whenever I watch it.I can't understand that Pocahontas has such a low score on IMDb, I just can't. Maybe it's because the voice-acting kinda sucks in the English version (compared to the Swedish-version it's light-years away).The Swedish voice-acting is just phenomenal, magical, it catches that sparkle that just a Disney movie have.Aaand this review sucks because I just messes up all the words so I'll sum it up.Watch Swedish-version.

206,kpbarr-band,Good soundtrack. Good artwork. Good storyline. Good Movie.,10,11 January 2010,"So I've spent some time reading the reviews after seeing why people gave it around a 6/10 at the time of my writing this. The main reasons I came up with are:1. Historical inaccuracy (poor depiction of Native American lifestyle, relations between settlers and Natives, and untrue account of the ""real"" Pocahontas story). 2. Didn't like the people who voiced the characters. 3. Didn't think it was as good as the other Disney movies. 4. Felt the themes were too ""adult"" oriented, and were not for Children. 5. Exact opposite of 4. 6. Didn't make them laugh enough. 7. Absolutely no legitimate reason other than they didn't like it, but still felt compelled to give it 1 star and write a 3-scentence summary of the plot.Let me start by giving the movie 10/10, to compensate for the 1 star ratings which are completely unwarranted, and say that really the film deserves around an 8/10. In response to the summarized criticisms.1. If you don't like historical inaccuracy, the solution is to stop watching movies. Historical films are enjoyable, but I don't think many people find their accuracies to be the most enjoyable thing about them. I don't see how this film could offend Native Americans. Does anyone know Pocahontas personally? As far as I'm concerned, this movie has a refreshingly original storyline that is almost completely fictional! I don't think anyone's playing it in the history classes, just the same as they aren't playing ""The Little Mermaid"" in Oceanography classes. It's a Disney movie for God's sake, I don't think anyone relies on them for serious historical information, and if ""the kids"" happen to believe that's what things were really like, then just read them the real story and have fun watching them cry-- then, 15 years later when they may actually understand/care who Pocahontas really was and what relations between the settlers and Natives were like, they can watch it again and perhaps appreciate the imagination it took to transform a story like that into something children would actually enjoy. 2. Only complaints I read were in reference to Mel Gibson. Apparently he has a ""boring"" voice. I think the three or so people who mentioned that may be the only three people on the planet who think that, but nonetheless, I think he fit the character well, and he did all his own singing! John Smith is not an over-the-top bubbly character. He is a serious man, and he speaks in a manly, somewhat reserved tone. However, he expresses anger and tenderness as well, and Mel Gibson voices both of those emotions very accurately. 3. I also saw a lot of ""in the shadow of"" comments. This movie has virtually the same cocktail as other Disney movies. Stunning animation, a brilliant soundtrack (by the same guy who did almost all the other soundtracks), a princess, a prince (of sorts), and a villain who loses in the end. How can the different setting and story make it that much worse than any of the other movies? 4&5. The fact that the critiques are opposite of each other illustrates the core misunderstanding behind both of them. Certain parts of the movie are geared towards children. Other parts, towards adults. Ultimately the movie aims to please both children and adults. In the original edit, a love song between Smith and Pocahontis was cut when test-screenings revealed that kids got bored with it too fast, and wanted to see more action. However, the film still contains relevant adult themes. It is a mistake to critique the movie for not catering entirely to one audience, as that was not its goal in the first place. 6. Disney movies always try to include comedic moments, but Pocahontas is definitely one of the more serious/sad films. It's not a comedy though, so I don't see why anyone would pan it for not having enough laughs. Where Pocahontis tries for levity, it achieves it on some level, and where it strives for poignancy it succeeds. Generally, I don't think the slapstick between Pocahontas' animal friends is at the core of the movie, however, it is enough to get a chuckle out the audience (even some of the more mature members). 7. Trolls, trolls, trolls, trolls, trolls. People who hated the movie sooo much, they felt compelled to go to IMDb, and vomit their low rating with no supporting explanation. In conclusion, I think that Pocahontas remains one of the Disney Renaissance's timeless classics. Alan Menkin did a beautiful job with the soundtrack, which is filled with many memorable songs including ""Colors of the Wind"" (which carries with it a unique emotional depth). The artwork in the film is done completely to Disney standards, and the storyline, which is slightly more mature than those of other Disney films, takes an imaginative, fictional leap away from the history that inspired it, while adding a genuinely good message about love, culture, and the wonders of nature.",Pocahontas
207,lionesscharlie,Great film for all ages,9,3 May 2005,"I don't understand why close-minded adults feel the need to comment on things that they obviously are far too jaded to enjoy anymore. I first saw the movie Pocahontas when I was about 12, I believe, and I loved it then - the music, the animation, the storyline...it was all so beautiful and engrossing. I am 20 years old now, and I still love the film to this day, and I probably always will. Stephen Shwartz and Alan Menken weave a lovely tale through their lyrics and orchestration, and the animation, in my opinion, is some of Disney's best. Right on par with films like The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast (an Academy Award winner, mind you), I believe Pocahontas will be a film that spans generations to come.",Pocahontas
208,sujimariebff,So many questions... Good but unrealistic plot,6,13 March 2011,"This is definitely a well-made movie, and if you can get past the fact that this is basically... about 90% fiction (Pocahontas was in her tweens when she met John Smith, who was in his late 20s etc.)then the movie should be enjoyable. It's a great story, the soundtrack is great, and it shows racial prejudice from BOTH the whites and the Indians. HOWEVER, there are so many errors to this story that,for me, it's hard to watch the movie without blurting out ""WTF?"" and questioning the research people did for this film.For example... every time I watch the movie I'm always puzzled as to how they even passed up wherever the story is set as Jamestown and its surrounding areas... it's nothing like the real thing. Another question that always pops up in my head is how in hell the Indians and the whites are able to communicate (namely Pocahontas and John Smith) when supposedly the Indians have not been exposed to English and vice versa. I mean, they probably can if they spend enough time together, but the two appears to have understood each other after a few hours. Also, Pocahontas seems to be able to talk to Thomas and the others and Chief Powhatan can too with John Smith. How is this possible? It bugs me every time. I also don't really like the stereotypical portrayal of Native American spiritualism... I mean a talking tree is okay, they've had similar things in other Disney films, but ""listening to the wind"" seems a bit far-fetched. I mean, I don't disrespect their religion (and I'm no expert on it either) but I'm pretty sure they were smarter and more aware of life that they wouldn't go ask, say, a rock for advice. Or understand ""messages"" that the wind gives. The bottom line is that, though there are so many unrealistic aspects to this movie (the ones I mentioned could have been fixed... just because it's fictional doesn't mean it can't be realistic too) it is of the same quality of animation as other Disney-Renaissance films and is worth watching. You just have to be very deeply into the movie so you don't notice some big mistakes (like how P&S can communicate). That being said, though, I recommend other Disney movies from this time over this one, like Mulan and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. I know one guy was slamming that movie as a ""safe"" movie, but it's actually one of the darkest and most serious movies Disney made and the score (esp. ""Hellfire"") is AMAZING. It's also closer to its original novel by Victor Hugo, so if you just can't like Pocahontas after watching it, watch the Hunchback instead!:)",Pocahontas

I think it is a beautiful love story that shows that love is so much stronger than hate and overcome anything. It is a Romeo and Juliet type of story and adding the song ""If I Never Knew You"" back into the movie makes it even more real and powerful. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes love stories or just a good movie. I will never figure out why this movie is so underrated. I think that everyone in the world needs to watch this movie and compare it to today's world. It also shows that one person can make a difference in the world. We can't save the whole world, but we can start by being kind to others.",Pocahontas
211,sparrowsrum123,"Highly underrated, one of my favorite Disney movies....",10,7 January 2006,"I've spent the past half an hour reading page after page of comments, and this is the conclusion I've come to: The majority of people who despise this film say it's ""racist, ignorant, historically inaccurate, an insult to Native Americans, etc."" I think people need to realize this movie isn't meant to be a History Channel Documentary- it's meant for entertainment purposes, and to show a lesson (like most Disney movies). If I had to choose between Finding Nemo and Pocahontas, I'd pick this movie over any Pixar cash cow any day.Whatever happened to the ""golden ages"" of Disney- when everyone seemed devoted and dedicated to what they were putting out there for people to see? Now they only care about making money, thanks to Eisner (who is FORTUNATELY gone).Anyway, what was I saying? Oh yeah. Back to the movie: *SPOILERS* I think what separates this Disney movie from the rest is that it has more adult elements. For example: Pocahontas and John Smith don't end up together in the end. In basically ever other Disney film I've seen, they all have the ""let's live together and have babies and live happily ever after. The End!"" sort of movies. Pocahontas has a distinct realness about her that separates her from the rest of Disney's protagonists. For once, Disney depicts an independent woman who knows what she needs and can fend for herself. As for some of the reviewers saying Radcliffe was ""weak"", I disagree. He truly depicted what most money(and land) hungry conquerors were like: they wanted land to expand their empires, wanted money (gold at the time), and didn't want others to occupy it that weren't like them (both in physical appearance and social class).I also have to add that the animation and soundtrack are absolutely breathtaking. Whenever I watch this film, I feel like I can connect to the environment, and the songs aren't cheesy at all. I was 4 and a half when Pocahontas came out, and I liked it for different reasons (such as Meeko, Flick, the Barbie dolls, merchandise, etc.) than I do know. As a teen, I see this movie as a true piece of art in cinema that should never be forgotten.",Pocahontas

Although I pointed out that the actors playing the Natives in this film were in fact of Native origin, she still thought the film was insulting.Although I like the film and love the songs, I can see why this film has had some controversy. The film is probably the most adult Disney film in terms of content and although the film is supposed to be based on actual events, the film goes in an entirely different direction - another point my grandmother pointed out ""they could've been more accurate with the story"".

But now, almost ten years later I saw it again, and wow what a surprise I got... The movie is probably the only Disney movie with a REAL love story, the sneak around and tries to hide their love, and in the incredibly sad ending, they choose life over love (or something like that), which makes the whole thing mature and realistic. And the music, that wonderful music. ""Colors of the wind"" (fantastic singing by musical star Judy Kuhn) is probably one of the best Disney songs of all time. The other songs are great too. The only thing the film lacks is ""classic"" animation, these new things like; not seeing Pocahontas nose from the front, I dunno, I can't help thinking of this film with the animators (and style) from ""The beauty and the beast"". The voice acting is top notch by the way!

It's a Disney movie, an animated children's movie. Of course, it's not suppose to accurate. The point of the movie is to deliver a message to children, not to teach 6, 7, 8 year olds historical facts. Yes this movie is ""hollywood-ized"" but like I said it's a Disney film whose purpose is to entertain not to inform. It delivers a beautiful message especially with the song savages. Both sides sing the same song to show how similar they are. They had this message earlier with the song, ""Colors of the Wind"". Also, it teaches children to follow their hearts and not follow the crowd/mob mentality. If you're really judging this movie solely on historical accuracy, that is just plain dumb.

218,ctowry0209,Ehhh.,3,9 November 2013,"One of the first inaccuracies of the Disney movie, Pocahontas, is that her name really was not Pocahontas, which many folks may not know. Her actual Powhatan name was Matoaka. Pocahontas was a nickname given to her by the English settlers which meant ""spoiled child"" or ""the naughty one."" Many only know her as Pocahontas, which I must say that was what I thought her name was until now. The setting of the film is very fairytale-like and very animated to make the scene look more appealing. If one actually analyzes the setting in the movie, they will see many wrong geographical landscapes. They clearly did not do much research on the geography and environment of Jamestown. In the movie, Pocahontas is seen a top of huge cliffs and mountains which was wrong because the land of Jamestown is mostly and relatively flat. They make the environment a more dramatic scenery than it truly was. One other geographical inaccuracy is the fact that the Disney movie shows moose, bald eagles, sunflowers, and other animals and plants that clearly were not in the town of Virginia. Also, Pocahontas is seen near a waterfall in the film, but Jamestown did not have waterfalls like the one in the movie. Aside from the geographical inaccuracies in Pocahontas, Disney portrays the Powhatan culture as a stereotypical Indian tribe which many Indian tribes were nothing alike. The men of the tribe did not wear feathers and neither did they wear skirts. Most of the Indians wore close to nothing of clothes, but they cannot show nudity in a cartoon movie. Also, Disney made their houses look like regular Indian longhouse which is not what they lived in. This movie disrespects a lot of the Native American culture. It is also believed that the Native Americans had a wonderful relationship with the animals which was most likely wrong. Yes, they may have had a better understanding of the habitat and animals, but it was not like they portrayed in the movie. In Pocahontas, Hollywood makes one believe that the Indians and English settlers were all mean to each other which is inaccurate. It was actually the English men who did not like the Indians and invaded the Indians land, brought war, diseases, and other unwelcome changes. It shows in the movie, the Native Americans preparing to fight the 'paleface demons' which makes them look equally to blame for the troubles between the two. Clearly, the English settlers were to blame for the invasion. Much of the tribe, like ninety percent, died from the diseases brought to the lands because they were not accustomed to those sicknesses. One of the historical accuracy was how the settlers acted in the movie, Pocahontas. They were there for ""Gold, God, and Glory"" which was very true. Also, the Englishman sang a song when they arrived to the lands about the Indians. One of the lyrics from the song quotes, ""Savages, savages, barely even humans,"" which the English settlers did think of the Native Americans during that time. The Disney movie also does not show Pocahontas helping the English settlement in Jamestown. If it were not for her support, then many more of the settlers would have died. One of the biggest historical inaccuracy in the Disney animated film, Pocahontas, is the romantic relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith. She was portrayed to be this young woman and him to be a young man. More than likely, Pocahontas was ten to thirteen years old and John was in his later twenties, which that is a huge difference than what the movie makes you believe. So, when one thinks that, one must think John Smith was a pedophile, but truly they had no romance between them. The movie makes one think that they meet at a waterfall and instantly fall in love, but more than likely they did not meet that way considering there was not a huge waterfall like that in Jamestown. Close to the ending of the movie, Pocahontas, one sees her throw herself on John Smith to save him from getting killed by the Powhatan tribe because she was in love with him. That was wrong. She did not have to save John Smith nor was she in love with him. At the end of the movie, the Disney movie makes you believe that she was torn between staying with her father and the Powhatan tribe or leaving to go to England with the man she loves. That was not the case. Pocahontas was kidnapped by English settlers and became a Christian, she was baptized and given a new name, Rebecca. She became married to a John, not John Smith, but John Rolfe. Then later in her late twenties, she became sick with some disease like tuberculosis and died. In conclusion, the Walt Disney movie, Pocahontas, was a wonderful movie. But the historical background and how Pocahontas was portrayed was entirely inaccurate. Many say this is one of the most inaccurate historical movies out there in the nation and after finding all the material that was wrong, I must say I agree with others. Even though it was a great animated, fairytale movie, that does not make it factual.",Pocahontas
219,irvan-sunaryanto,Underrated,10,18 January 2014,"I'm still surprised that Pocahontas didn't get at least 8 in it's ratings. For a movie that was made in the 90's i think the animation is perfect with details such as the environment of America back then and mouth vocal accuracy. Not to mention the music, it gives shivers down my back, listening to songs such as Colors of the Wind, If I Never Knew You and so on. This movie show so much of two different cultures (Not racism in some issue) meeting for the first time. On the other side, the story on this film is suitable for a rather understanding children because the topic is not as easy as other Disney movies. Overall i think this movie deserves more than what it has received and for me this film is recommended for any viewers looking for a good love story. Thank You",Pocahontas
220,tnjromaine,Pocahontas = propaganda,2,4 June 2014,"I give Pocahontas a 2 only because of the entertainment provided to children. I am appalled that Disney would produce a film with so many inaccuracies to our history. What is worse, is knowing so many children walk away from this film believing Pocahontas saved John Smith's life, that she was in love with him, that he was some wonderful English man. None of this is true. Pocahontas was only about 9 years old, 2nd, her father was not killing John Smith, he was adopting him as a son and third, they never fell in love with one another. At any library one can find a book on letters from John Smith. But please keep in mind as is true with most English writers from this period, his information is biased. The very least Disney could have done was to ensure to its audience at the beginning of the movie ""what you are about to see is fictional, none of the events, time lines, or ideas are factual. It is a shame to see how America's youth are being taught with so much misleading information as to how our country was built and furthermore, the actual people that built are company. Disney, you owe the Powhatan people a major apology!",Pocahontas
221,animeandmovielover,It's okay.,7,12 July 2005,"I really don't enjoy this movie much, just some of the songs like ""Mine,Mine,Mine"" and ""Just Around The Riverbend."" But the plot isn't the best out of the other Disney movies. So, I say it's not something that would be a good movie to watch so many times. I saw it in the theater, and didn't enjoy it to much. Only certain parts of the movie are funny. The songs are good, but the plot isn't very good. I saw it a few times, haven't watched in four years, so that tells you something. I just think it's not the best out of the Disney Movies, like Lion King, Toy Story, and other movies. So I give it a 5, it's alright, but not good. That's all I have to say about it.",Pocahontas
222,budhaditya_s-174-343928,Stunning!!,10,1 December 2014,"Pocahontas may not have been able to reach the heights of its predecessor, The Lion King, but in my opinion it's still a masterpiece, especially the animation. In fact it is considered to be Disney's most visually stunning movie. As far as the movie itself is concerned, I would give it two thumbs up. The characters, the music and of course the tearful ending where Pocahontas and John Smith bid farewell to each other are all beautifully done. The character of Pocahontas is itself a highlight in the movie. Unlike the princesses before her who just wait for a man to come for them, Pocahontas takes matters into her own hands when necessary. A prominent example would be when she placed her own head on John Smith's head as her father is about to kill him. Other than being brave she is also intelligent, playful, and respects everyone and everything around her. And yes, she is not afraid to speak her mind! I love everything about her and really hope that she gets more attention than she deserves.Finally,the movie might be historically inaccurate, but if you try to view at as a beautifully animated love story instead, it might not seem so bad.Overall Pocahontas is a lovely movie and deserves much more credit than it actually gets.",Pocahontas
223,irishgrl-1,Even better 10 years later!,10,12 June 2005,"Recently I started watching this again with my 4yr old son and fell in love with it all over again! The music is outstanding (I especially love the ""Colors of the Wind"") and the entire movie is a visual treat! I know many have complained that the movie is a European version of an event and demeaning to American Indians, but from what I've read, Russel Means (voice of Powhatan) was happy with the final product and its portrayal of Native Americans. Whether or not it is historically accurate, it is great entertainment and I believe the overall message of peace and acceptance between peoples is timeless good advice. All in all, a great addition to the Disney catalog of movies.",Pocahontas
224,chelsealikedaocean,Underrated,10,30 September 2021,This at least deserves a higher score than Kung Fu Panda. I have loved this movie since I was a child and I think it has been getting an unfair retrospective recently. This is not the greatest work of art that Disney ever made but it does have meaningful themes and something to say. I am in my 30s and I return to this movie every so often because the songs are catchy and have unique sounds comparatively.,Pocahontas
225,bigstone90,An outstanding film for anyone. Truly incredible and beautiful,10,9 July 2005,"I watched the movie about three days ago for the first time and I have to say that its just a great movie. It has excellent songs and can be enjoyed by all ages. But be warned: The true story is FAR different then in this movie. Its hard to have the same respect for the film knowing that most of it is fictionalized. None the less, its an extraordinary movie and you should definitely watch it. However, you should do some research on the true story if you want to fully understand what the film is about. Some say that it is so far from the true story that it can't even be considered to be the same story. But the fact is that Disney wasn't interested in facts. They just wanted to make an enjoyable film and they delivered. Now for the music: The song ""Colors of the wind"" is a truly beautiful song and has a powerful message and I can see why it won so many awards. ""Savages"" is also a good song. I can't say that there are any faults with any of the songs in this movie. I get agitated when people cut down the film for the fact that its not exactly historically accurate. But the fact is that Disney simply couldn't make a film appropriate for all ages if they had used the actual events. For example: You can feel the chemistry between John Smith and Pocahontas very strongly.In the movie they both meet as young adults. You simply would be unable to feel the chemistry on that kind of a level if John Smith was 30 ad Pocahontas was 12. Now I know what you saying: "" This is a Disney movie. How could it possibly be on a adult maturity?"" Believe me, if its a mature film experience you want, watch this movie. This is simply one of the best movies of all time and there is no denying it.",Pocahontas
226,hilltoreal,Misfire,7,12 April 2016,"I guess to really review the Pocahontas film we must first start at the origin of its creation. In 1992 the film was in production. When Disney decided on the making of this movie they explained that the film would be based on the legends and folktales surrounding Pocahontas. Based on my research it seems that not even historians agree on all the facts of the original story. What this means is that Disney chose (in a sense) the more colorful version of the Pocahontas story, no pun intended. Since Disney knew they would be going out on a ledge with this story they claimed that their main focus was sentiment when it came to portraying American Indians. So they sought the help of American Indian Activists. This was done in an effort to cover their ""you know what,"" and to prevent an uproar within the American Indian community. To understand the differences between the historical event of John Smith's voyage to Jamestown and Disney's interpretation of it we must first take a look at how the character's compare. The first character we will look at is Pocahontas. In the Disney version, Pocahontas is a spirited, good-natured, fearless creature. She is full of curiosity and loves everything around her, even the trees that she has no problem talking to every morning. She is the cherished daughter of chief Powhatan, and her poised stance on the edge of the cliff is evidence of her wisdom beyond her years. In the original story, Pocahontas was also known as ""Matoaka."" She was still the beloved daughter of Chief Powatan, and like the movie she was still lively and playful. But one distinctive difference based on historical research is the physical appearance of Pocahontas. Historical research suggests that unlike the tall, slim, new age model type appearance that Pocahontas has in the Disney film, her figure was quite different. This makes one wonder why Disney would ignore or alter the historical knowledge that they had about the appearance of Native American women. In 1607 ""hero"" John Smith traveled on an extensive voyage to to Virginia, and the movie does a good job making it clear that the journey's main purpose was gold. But that is about the only thing that comes close to the actual events in Jamestown in 1607.This brings me to my next point that this story is a drastically inaccurate depiction of the actual historical event at Jamestown. For one, Pocahontas did fall in love but not with a man named John Smith. The guy that she married and conceived a child with was named John Rowe. Now as unimportant as that may sound, it's actually misleading to children when confronted with the details of an important time in our history. The inaccuracies stretch even to the clothes that they wore— that being said I highly doubt Native American women ran around in mini-skirts. So what was Disney's angle? I'm still not sure! Grant it that it is a Disney film, and Disney movies more often than not miss the mark when it comes to historical facts, but this movie was more like a misfire. It seems that even though they had the help of Native American activists, Disney still couldn't avoid the stereotypes. Though the film shows John Smith as a ""Hero,"" I gave Disney a pass on this one because the young viewers do need a character with morals that they can aspire to be like. But historically Smith was manipulative, and his only interest was money, power and fame. In thinking about this movie I had a talk with a friend  and he brought up a good point. How the marriage between Pocahontas and Smith could have been a modern-day tabloid to distract from the horrid events that happened during this time in history. I think you can even take it a step further to say to make this movie a romantic tragedy with their wedding is added injury to insult.But damn, sorry for the rant I actually love Disney movies in all its glory. Yes, even Pocahontas, aside from the violence, the young viewers are exposed to characters with morals and strong constitutions. It teaches them about the greater good and the power of love. If I had to change something about the story, though, I would change the moral of it. I would change it from love conquers all to, people can change. This way the marriage wouldn't be the corner stone of the film, the fact that two different nations with two different languages can find a common ground would be the conclusion to this tragic tale.",Pocahontas
227,salehahoffman,Analysis of Pocahontas,7,5 June 2017,"Pocahontas is a charming story about two young people who fall in love despite the fact that the groups they belong to want to kill each other; much like Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. This one is a classic Disney movie that captures the audience's attention with unrealistically beautiful people, great music, and great animation that is characteristic of Disney. However, I don't think the climax lives up to the tensions in the rest of the plot. Also, after that there are no real negotiations between the Englishmen and the Native Americans about how they will coexist in Virginia. Finally, the whole movie is very historically inaccurate and should not be showed to a history class for educational purposes. The climax is the scene where both sides are ready to fight each other and the chief is about to smash John Smith's head in with a rock. This scene is over within a couple minutes and the movie is over soon after that. The entire movie leads up to the climax, like in any movie, but the scene itself is somewhat disappointing. Pocahontas throws herself on top of John Smith and just like that her father has a change of heart and so do the colonists. There is no internal conflict shown for anyone except Pocahontas about the killing of John Smith, and because of that the climax is lacking. In addition, there are no real negotiations between the Englishmen and the Native Americans after the war is avoided about how they will coexist in Virginia. After the war is avoided, Ratcliffe, the governor, attempts to assassinate the chief and because John Smith throws himself in front of the bullet, the potential repercussions are ignored and everyone suddenly gets along. This is entirely unrealistic because, as everyone knows, getting two different groups of people to get along can be very, very difficult. Also, for the entire movie each respective group tells their people that the other is terrible and out to get them. The colonists are told that the Native Americans are ""savages"" and to shoot them on sight. Alternatively, the Native Americans are told that the white people are violent and barbaric and call on other tribes to help them in the seemingly inevitable war. This kind of negative sentiment is not just given up in a matter of five minutes. It should have taken them much longer to work out their differences. This film should not be showed to a history class as it is very historically inaccurate and therefore cannot really teach students anything about the way life was when the English arrived in Jamestown, Virginia. In the movie, the character who falls in love with Pocahontas is John Smith. However, the person who really married Pocahontas was John Rolfe. John Smith did initiate friendly relations with the Native Americans, but it was John Rolfe that brought Pocahontas to England where she died of dysentery a few years after she gave birth to their son. Also, while it is not actually known when exactly Pocahontas was born, it is said that she was born around 1595. Assuming this is true, in 1607, when the English arrived at Jamestown, she would have been 12 years old. In the movie she was portrayed to be much older than this and falls in love with 26 year old, John Smith who was more than twice her age. Finally, in the movie, Ratcliffe is depicted as this rich, gold-hungry leader who wants to kill all of the ""savages"" and forbids John Smith from going to talk with the Native Americans to promote peace. Ratcliffe orders his men to shoot any Native American on sight and, as a result, sparks the beginnings of a war with them. He also refuses to accept the fact that the Native Americans have agreed to put down their weapons and live in peace with the Englishmen and in an attempt to shoot the chief of their tribe, accidentally shoots John Smith. Most of this is historically inaccurate. While it is true that many of the colonists didn't like him, Governor Ratcliffe actually asked John Smith to begin friendly relations with the Native Americans when he was in office and encouraged him to establish trading between them. These three are among the many inaccuracies in this movie that make it uninformative.In conclusion, although I enjoyed the movie very much, it is historically inaccurate and therefore can't really teach anything about history. Pocahontas is a nice story with a great soundtrack, however, the climax doesn't encompass the entire plot efficiently, there are no peace negotiations, and important aspects of the movie are historically inaccurate.",Pocahontas
228,hidenothing117,great movie!!,10,31 October 2005,i absolutely love the movie!!!! it is my all time favorite. i love watching it. i would definitely recommend this movie. the songs in it are wonderful. i sing them all the time. and john smith and Pocahontas are just perfect for each other. and their love is so alive and real. nothing will stop then from being together. as they do all the can to stay together many troubles get in their way but they work through it. when the movie is over it just makes you want to fall in love. the movie is beautiful. the drawings in this movie are so life like and real. it definitely is a MUST see movie. i think everyone should see this fabulous movie!,Pocahontas
229,amypoehler,"Beautiful movie, beautiful message about loving the earth",10,2 July 2018,"Pocahontas suffers from a dated depiction of native American tribes and the fact that it came out the same year as Disney's masterpiece The Lion King, but it's so much better than the Princess Movies that get more attention. Pocahontas feels like a real person with hopes and dreams and fears, the score is breathtaking and the animation is absolutely lovely. Yes, there are stereotypes, but on the whole it's not the most backward story from the 90s, and if you watch with a critical eye and a grain of salt, you can learn a lot about history and love and taking care of mother nature. Colors of the Wind is one of the best songs in the world.",Pocahontas
230,Marchchild24,"Not the Greatest, but great",8,9 March 2006,"Alright, the movie is not accurate. I understand the anger over the mistakes portrayed in the film. I have researched Pocahontas, and understand why some are upset. But I researched her life BECAUSE of the film. It inspired in me something my teachers (and public school) failed, the desire to learn history. Disney NEVER claimed to be doing a movie on the actual events. They said they were basing the movie on the legend of Pocahontas. The legend has always held that she and John loved each other, she saved him, and etc. Legends are never historically accurate. They are derived from true happenings, but they are part of folk lore. While reading the posted comments, I noticed this argument, ""The natives are stereotyped, the movie was racist"" and such. When Powhaten is first introduced, he is talking about a war his people were just in with another Native American village. His people were shown as entirely human for the first time in cinema. Here they are, they love the earth and each other. They war with neighbors, and make alliances. They misunderstand and jump to conclusions like EVERYBODY ELSE!!!!! They were shown as both wise and ignorant. In short they were not shown as tree-Hughes, because they war. They were not shown as ""savages"", because they protect their children. They were the first to call off the fight after Pocahontas saved John Smith. I do not believe this movie was racist. Parts of the movie was edited awkwardly, and John Smith did lack flavor. Otherwise the music was grand.",Pocahontas
