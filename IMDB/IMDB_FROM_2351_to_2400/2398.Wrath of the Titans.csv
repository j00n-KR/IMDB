0,TheLittleSongbird,Uggh!,3,9 April 2012,"I didn't think much of the 2010 Clash of the Titans, finding it visually spectacular but hollow. After hearing from people that Wrath of the Titans was better, I was intrigued in seeing. After seeing it for myself, I'm afraid I have to respectfully disagree, I actually thought it was worse. By all means it wasn't entirely disposable, but it suffered from a lot of things that hindered the 2010 Clash of the Titans.The sets and costumes do look spectacular, and some of the action sequences do look equally great especially the scene between the two-headed, fire-breathing demon(s), but while impressive in visual spectacle there wasn't anything completely thrilling coming across as emotionally empty instead. The quality of the special effects are inconsistent, the Cyclops was good but the Minotaur not so much.Fans of the 1981 original Clash of the Titans(I'm not a fan as such but I am somewhat fond of it) will enjoy the appearance of the mechanical owl Bubu. The camera work often felt awkward, part of the reason why the action sequences didn't thrill me was because of the choppy way the camera work and editing was constructed perhaps. Jonathan Liebsmann's direction is marginally better than that of Battle: Los Angeles, but still felt bland and characterless.Other components don't work either. The dialogue is stilted, the story is tediously paced, one-note and uninteresting overall, the music feels generic and the characters seem as though any personality they had potential to have was swamped the visual spectacle. Of the acting, Sam Worthington looks uncomfortable and is an uncharismatic lead. Any film with Liam Nesson and Ralph Fiennes promises much, but here they don't have much to do and seem as though they are phoning in. Only Bill Nighy seems to be having fun, and compared to everything else actually he was pretty good.All in all, a soulless and hollow film that sacrifices any credibility to writing, story and characters for visual spectacle. As impressive as it looked, I rarely found that it thrilled or even engaged me. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Wrath of the Titans
1,Leofwine_draca,Spectacular,6,12 February 2018,"WRATH OF THE TITANS is another 3D blockbuster and a follow up to CLASH OF THE TITANS. I enjoy these movies, even though the storytelling is little more than a joining of dots in between the next CGI action set-piece. This one sees Perseus retired to live the life of a peaceful fisherman, until Hades and Ares concoct a plot to unleash the father of the gods, Cronos, from his underworld stasis. It's another simple effort about the hunt for a magical item and a race against time, and it feels very much like an updated Ray Harryhausen movie with CGI replacing the old stop motion effects. I've never been a fan of Worthington but you get plenty of familiar faces fleshing out the cast here, from a returning Neeson and Fiennes to Rosamund Pike's warrior woman and Toby Kebbell as the comic relief. I saw this in 3D and the effects are fine, not quite top-tier, but there's plenty of depth and a few 'duck' moments. The CGI is very good and culminates in an excellent pitched battle against Cronos, who could have come straight from a mega-budget kaiju movie.",Wrath of the Titans
2,SnoopyStyle,wall-to-wall CGI overwhelms the movie,6,13 October 2014,"After defeating the Kraken, Perseus returns to the quiet life of a fisherman and the sole parent to his son Helius. Zeus (Liam Neeson) warns Perseus (Sam Worthington) of a coming battle. Mankind has stopped worshiping the Gods and they are weaken for it. Titans are fighting their imprisonment and Kronos himself could rise. Kronos is the father of brothers Zeus, Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston) whom they imprisoned long ago in the Tartarus. Hades double-cross Zeus along with Zeus' son Ares (Edgar Ramírez) aligning themselves with Kronos. They drain Zeus' powers to release Kronos. Perseus goes to Olympus and finds Poseidon who dies leaving him the trident. Perseus must battle the monsters and rescue Zeus with the help of warrior Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), Poseidon's son Argenor (Toby Kebbell), and fallen god Hephaestus (Bill Nighy).The story is complicated especially if you don't have a degree in Greek mythology. The movie doesn't waste much time explaining things before they start spending the big CGI bucks. And they spend a lot of it in this movie. This is wall-to-wall big CGI. It wears me out. Then I start to be stunned by it all and then I started to admire the audacity. As a story, there is some interesting daddy issues on display. Sam Worthington remains one of the most wooden actors leading big budget blockbusters. Rosamud Pike is an odd and unlikely choice for a Greek warrior queen. It's not just the English Rose looks but also the fact that she's not usually an action star. This is a movie where all consideration is made for big CGI action and not much for everything else.",Wrath of the Titans
3,Prismark10,Gods and Monsters,6,3 August 2013,"I think the producers knew there was an element of camp and tosh with the first film. They even knowingly repeat the line, 'Release the Kraken' with a wink.The sequel is actually better than Clash of the Titans.It very much gets going as soon as the films starts. The Greek gods are waning as people stopped praying to them and there is skullduggery going on which has little to do with the Greek Myths.The action takes place about 10 years after the events of Clash. Perseus is living a simple life as a fisherman with his son before he is called into action.
Sam Worthington who has racked up a series of hit films in recent years does his bland best here with some good special effects, very good set pieces which keep things moving along. There is the odd duff line here and there.Bill Nighy, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy lend respectability and Danny Huston plays a rare good god role.",Wrath of the Titans
4,claudio_carvalho,When the Sequel is Better and Better,7,17 June 2012,"Perseus (Sam Worthington) and his son Helius live as fishermen in a small village. One night, Zeus (Liam Neeson) visits Perseus and tells that the gods are weaker since the humans do not pray for them anymore. He tells that the walls of Tartarus are falling down in the underworld and all the demons will be released on Earth and Kronos will escape from his imprisonment. Zeus goes to the underworld with Poseidon (Danny Huston) to join forces with Ares (Édgar Ramírez) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes) but they are betrayed and Zeus is captured. Poseidon escapes deadly wounded and encounters Perseus in the Zeus' Temple. He gives his trident to Perseus and advises him to meet his son and also demigod Agenor (Toby Kebbell) in the kingdom of Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and ask him to guide Perseus to find the fallen one. Together with Andromeda, they begin their saga to release Zeus and avoid that Ares and Hades unleash the ancient Titan Kronos. ""Wrath of the Titans"" is a sequel of ""Clash of Titans"" that is better and better than the first film. The story is engaging and full of action, with a great cast and magnificent CGI. ""Wrath of the Titans"" is not a masterpiece but fans of the genre will certainly not be disappointed. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Fúria de Titãs 2"" (""Wrath of Titans 2"")",Wrath of the Titans
5,nogodnomasters,MORE TO LIFE THAN GODS AND TITANS,8,19 April 2018,"All hell breaks loose (literally) in this non-mythological based sequel to ""Clash of the Titans."" This story bridges the time of the gods and legends to the time of men. The gods have been losing their power because people have stopped praying to them. Hades, the god of the underworld (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares, god of war (Édgar Ramírez) join forces to release Kronos from Tartus and destroy the gods. Zeus (Liam Neeson) is taken captive and held prisoner as his power is slowly drained from him.Perseus, son of Zeus (Sam Worthington) teams up with Queen Andromeda(Rosamund Pike), Hephaestus (Bill Nighy) and Agenor (Toby Kebbell) to enter the ever shifting labyrinth of Tartus and free Zeus. Apparently ordering everyone to pray to Zeus to give him power is no longer an option. Alexa Davalos played the original Andromeda...just pretend you are watching ""Bewitched.""The movie gives you a brief intro, but there is no real character build-up with an assumption that you have seen the other film. The action hits the screen from almost the moment the movie starts and continues until it ends. There are a few brief scenes without fighting and killing, but they are designed to set up for the next action scene or action game as the case may be. The special effects were superb. The plot was good in keeping in line with the mythology, however the dialouge could have been better with less phrases designed to be truisms and with more funnier quips. Worthington, still living off his Avatar success, gives us his typical less than stellar performance.No f-bomb, sex, or nudity. Plenty of killing, monster horror, and violence.",Wrath of the Titans
6,kosmasp,Wrath of the audience,4,31 May 2012,"Actually this is far removed from the mess that was called Clash of the Titans. 3D mess, story mess, no real comedy in sight and quite a lot of other things that went wrong in the first one. Although as I have stated before elsewhere, the first one would have worked a lot better without the 3D (still wouldn't have been a much better movie though). 3D isn't a problem with this oneA more straight movie, that works better but still has some issues. Technically this seems really good. Maybe the story could have done with some tweaking. But then again it came only 2 years after the original (read remake), so what could you expect from it? Exactly!",Wrath of the Titans
7,jboothmillard,Wrath of the Titans,3,27 May 2019,"Clash of the Titans, a remake of the 1980s movie, was okay, it obviously made a good amount of money at the box office, otherwise there probably wouldn't have been a sequel, directed by Jonathan Liebesman (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Battle Los Angeles). Basically Perseus (Sam Worthington), a son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), lives as a fisherman with his young son, Helius (John Bell). Zeus visits Perseus and asks for his help, humans are not praying to the gods, and as a result the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal, and the walls of Tartarus are crumbling, but Perseus refuses to get involved. Zeus meets his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Édgar Ramírez) in Tartarus. He asks for Hades' help, but the lord of the underworld rejects and attacks Zeus, and Ares betrays him, they plan to make a deal with Kronos to remain immortal, and they unleash monsters onto the world. After killing a Chimera that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father. Instead he finds Poseidon dying, he tells him what is happening, and to find his Demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) who will lead him to Hephaestus (Bill Nighy), who knows the way into Tartarus. Perseus, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), and Agenor travel to find Hephaestus on a hidden island. On the way, Agenor explains three weapons: Zeus' thunderbolt, Hades's pitchfork, and Poseidon's trident, can jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. After defeating a Cyclops (Martin Bayfield), the travellers manage to find Hephaestus, and they reach the entrance of a labyrinth leading to Tartarus. Hephaestus sacrifices himself during an attack by Ares to allow Perseus, Andromeda, and Agenor to enter the labyrinth. Inside they encounter a Minotaur, but Perseus manages to kill it, and the group eventually enter Tartarus. Zeus has been almost entirely drained of power as Kronos awakens, he apologises to Hades for banishing him to the underworld and asks his forgiveness, and he forgives Hades for his actions. Hades decides to help Zeus and stop Kronos, but Ares wants to proceed. Perseus arrives and frees Zeus, and challenges Ares to a duel, while Hades revives Zeus, and together they defeat the creatures. Kronos appears and attacks Andromeda's army, Zeus and Hades hold off Kronos while Perseus fights with and eventually kills Ares with the thunderbolt. Combining the gods' weapons into the Spear of Trium, Perseus destroys Kronos by throwing the spear into the heart of the monster. Zeus reconciles with Perseus and dies of his wounds, while Hades tells Perseus that he is powerless and leaves, in the end, Perseus kisses Andromeda, and gives his sword to son Helius. Also starring Lily James as Korrina, Kathryn Carpenter as Athena and Freddy Drabble as Apollo. The acting is okay, there is nothing wrong with the special effects, there are some exciting moments, and there's a small appearance from Bubo the mechanical owl from the original 1980 Clash of..., but it is pretty much the same as the previous film, a predictable story, a slightly boring and below average fantasy action adventure. Adequate!",Wrath of the Titans
8,paul_haakonsen,This movie was spectacular...,8,16 June 2012,"I found the 2010 ""Clash of the Titans"" to be adequate, but this 2012 ""Wrath of the Titans"" far outshines the first movie. So chances are if you enjoyed ""Clash of the Titans"", then you will definitely love ""Wrath of the Titans"".The story was more thought through in ""Wrath of the Titans"" compared to ""Clash of the Titans"", and there was a profound more depth to the storyline and the events that was portrayed. It is not really a story that requires much thinking from us as viewers, it is basically just sit back and enjoy the ride. Perseus (played by Sam Worthington) is living with his son Helius (played by John Bell) after his wife died. Mankind have stopped praying to the gods and that is about to bring about a cataclysmic event, as the deities are trying to awaken the father of gods, Kronos. It is up to Perseus, Agenor (played by Toby Kebbell) and Andromeda (played by Rosamund Pike) to stop the end of days. Along the way they get help from the eccentric Hephaestus (played by Bill Nighy).Something did puzzle me, was why people in ancient Greece spoke with a very distinct British accent, well most of them did anyway. That was just a little bit odd. But of course, this being a massive Hollywood production, they had to speak English and not Greek. Just saying that Greek would have added much more authenticity to the movie.The CGI effects in ""Wrath of the Titans"" were off the charts. I enjoyed this movie from start till end, especially because of the CGI effects. But also the details and touches the production staff had added into almost every single scene. Lots of really nice details to be seen here and there. The cyclops were really awesome, and they were brutal and savage, but also had a gentler side to them, which was interesting to see. The chimera that ravaged Perseus's village was also really nicely made; very aggressive and destructive, and once you got to see the creature up close and personal, there was a lot of great touches in details on it. Then speaking of Kronos, well his manifestation was amazing, as a huge molten lava/rock elemental, that looked just amazing.In my opinion, then the acting was really nice as well, and they had put together a great cast of well-talented actors and actresses. However, the ones that put on the most memorable performances and carried most of the movie (acting-wise) was Liam Neeson (playing Zeus) and Ralph Fiennes (playing Hades); they were just spectacular in their roles.""Wrath of the Titans"" is a great action movie from start to end, and all the amazing CGI really helps the movie along quite nicely. This movie is just pure testosterone and clearly aimed for a guy audience.If you enjoyed ""Clash of the Titans"" then you owe it to yourself to sit down and watch ""Wrath of the Titans"", because it just that much better.",Wrath of the Titans
9,hitchcockthelegend,"Feel that wrath, err, where?",5,18 May 2013,"Wrath of the Titans is directed by Jonathan Liebesman and written by Dan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson. It stars Sam Worthington, Rosamund Pike, Bill Nighy, Edgar Ramirez, Toby Kebbell, Dany Huston, Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson. Music is by Javier Navarrete and cinematography by Ben Davis.After the financial success of their remake of Clash of the Titans, it was inevitable that Warner Brothers would usher out a sequel. Amazingly it happens to be better, though that is not really a guide to quality since the first film was so distinctly average.This time the story actually has a story instead of an excuse to just throw an action scene after another action scene, and Worthington has had a haircut that at least passes for Greek mythology times! In fact the production design all round is much better. Though again, it didn't take much to improve...However, it's all very sluggish in execution, the director unable to garner dramatic suspense as we wait for the beasties and baddies to offer up their challenges. At times it feels exactly like it is what it is, a cash cow being milked to death, where even great thespians like Neeson and Fiennes have that look about them that says ""this one is paying for my new Rover next week"".That the film does exactly what the paying customers expect, you know – lots of machismo, bangs and crashes and CGI tomfoolery – is no reason to beat it down, but you would think the studio would want a bit more adventure for their bucks? To maybe entice new film watchers interested in the fantasy genre? Sadly that isn't the case.Still, I have been in lust with Rosamund Pike since forever, so her being prissy in this works well for me. Bill Nighy and Toby Kebbell are bright spots in amongst the beards and skirts, while Pegasus and Cyclops are joyously bought to life for our beady eyes to feast on. 5.5/10",Wrath of the Titans
10,Scarecrow-88,Wrath of the Titans,5,1 April 2013,"Well, I have to say that at least Wrath of the Titans was quick and didn't overstate its welcome. Certainly the story left me dubious: the gods have lost their mojo because the mortals on Earth have quit praying to them. No longer acknowledging the gods, in particular Zeus, weakens them to the point that they're penetrable and killable. There's an underground ""prison"" that contains the evil, powerful god, Kronos, the father of Zeus and Hades, who will be freed if the powers of the gods diminish. The god of war, Ares, has forged a partnership with Hades to release Kronos and have the Earth to themselves. Hades, to tell you the truth, was just miffed Zeus confined him to the prison to keep watch over fiery pops. Ares is just upset with Zeus because he was partial to half-god/half-mortal Perseus. Ares, a god, all jealous because his father showed Perseus a bit more attention: you kind of have to be prepared for a storyline and characters that seem designed with little importance other than to service a LOT of special effects. Kronos is this ""lava god"" and when it is finally released from a volcano, sweeps its arms to and fro decimating the land in front of it. There are even these fighting creatures that seem to create from the lava that falls from Kronos' arms to the ground. The film has plenty of monsters like one-eyed giants, a three-headed, fire-breathing dragon with venomous saliva, and a two-horned beast that greets Perseus when he and his mates descend into the labyrinthine prison designed to keep Kronos in and others out (besides the gods who enter in easily). Poseidon and Hades (along with Ares who is basically a very powerful infantile punk) are the other popular gods who accompany Zeus to give the sequel some clout. You even actually see Zeus and Hades joining forces ""to have some fun"" as they try to hold Kronos in check while Perseus attempts to fly in winged horse into the heart of the major god using a certain ""triple sword"" made by a certain craftsman (Bill Nighy, consummate scene-stealer he is) (Poseidon's triton, Hades' spear, and Zeus' lightning bolt) who was also responsible for the underground prison. You have Poseidon's son, a thief and vagabond who has never lived up to expectations (he's considered a disappointment), found in the prison of Andromeda (played this time by Rosamund Pike, getting to participate in a lot of action), leader of a great army hoping to fend off Ares and Kronos the best they can. Andromeda and Poseidon's son, Agenor (Toby Kebbell) will accompany Perseus (Sam Worthington) on their destination to rescue the imprisoned Zeus (attacked by Ares viciously), too weak to escape on his own, his power being drained by Kronos without Hades (Ralph Fiennes, not mining the cold-blooded villainy he can typically muster even while sleepwalking through a role) helping his brother. Ares (Edgar Ramirez) and Perseus duke it out a few times (as Andromeda and Agenor come at him with intentions of besting him and not succeeding, along with other soldiers), with the latter often on the bad end of a good throttling. This time Perseus has a son, Helius, he aims to protect and father, but not without (no surprise here) Ares using the kid at the end to get under the skin of his brotherly rival. There just wasn't much heavy lifting intellectually going into the script; it is designed to cater to an audience who doesn't want to dwell on dialogue, narrative of any heady consequence, or multi-faceted characters. Almost from the get-go, the film has Perseus having to scurry about his seaside village hoping to find a way to kill the dragon destroying whatever is in its path. Then Zeus is captured and raped of his god powers while Hades slowly becomes guilty and sorrowful of his participation in it. Soon Hades sees the errors of his ways and tries to combat Ares who seems just as strong as his elder gods. Gods reduced to humans seemed rather odd to me; I had a hard time imagining Zeus could be so reduced. It is ultimately about a son rescuing his father and embracing a side of him he hadn't quite appreciated or admired that much before, handy when in battle with a brother who is angry and bitter, with an ax to grind. Worthington ably and athletically does as his hero role demands, playing to the special effects screen when required, occasionally moving about exteriors as needed. I guess you could look at this similar to Jurassic Park III, in that Wrath is an overproduced 90 minute popcorn movie made to excite audiences not looking to be fed intellectually.",Wrath of the Titans
11,zardoz-13,"""Wrath"" Tops ""Clash of the Titans""",8,8 April 2012,"If you applauded the larger-than-life heroics in ""Clash of the Titans,"" you'll probably embrace the derivative exploits ""Wrath of the Titans"" delivers in less time than the original. Greek mythology tales have never really gone out of fashion. ""Wrath of the Titans"" qualifies as an above-average entry in the CGI special effects laden genre where gods, men, and monsters scrimmage. Don't confuse ""Wrath of the Titans"" with last year's similarly themed ""Immortals."" Comparatively, the two PG-13 rated ""Titans"" spectacles are considerably less savage and sadistic than ""Immortals."" While ""Clash of the Titans"" served as an origins epic, ""Wrath"" concerns most of the same characters about ten years later. In ""Clash of the Titans,"" the infant demigod Perseus was condemned to die with his mother in a casket plunged into the sea. Miraculously, Perseus survived. A humble fisherman, Spyros (Pete Postlethwaite), rescued Perseus and adopted him. As he grew up, Perseus shunned the gods until Zeus recruited him to save the city of Argos. Hades, the cruel god of the Tartarus, loosened the legendary sea monster the Kraken with Zeus' blessing to destroy the city of Argo if the citizens didn't sacrifice Andromeda. Defiantly, Perseus and several Argos soldiers embarked on a quest for anything which would enable them to kill the Kraken. Ultimately, our resourceful hero tangled with the malevolent Medusa. Half-woman and half-snake, this deadly dame had scores of vipers sprouting from her head rather than curls. A mere glance at Medusa's face would petrify any mortal. Ingeniously, Perseus found a way to decapitate Medusa without eyeballing her. Perseus saved Princess Andromeda from a fate worse than death and defeated the enormous creature with Medusa's head.""Battle Los Angeles"" director Jonathan Liebesman's ""Wrath of the Titans"" emerges as a polished but predictable fantasy that imitates its predecessor. Everybody who made ""Clash"" doesn't show up for ""Wrath."" Happily, Sam Worthington returns as Zeus' rebellious son Perseus who wants little to do with his all-powerful patriarch. Instead of a boot camp cut, Perseus has a perm that makes him look like Gordon Scott of ""Goliath"" fame. Perseus prefers to fish on the seas instead of parade around Mount Olympus. Despite the tragic death of his wife Io (Gemma Arterton) in ""Clash of the Titans,"" Perseus has a son, ten-year old Helius (John Bell of ""Battleship""), to raise alone. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Danny Huston reappear respectively as Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon. Rosamund Pike replaces Alexa Davalos as Andromeda. This time around Andromeda is more pugnacious. Decked out in combat regalia, she leads her army into battle against the Titans. The biggest difference now is that the gods are losing their power because humans aren't praying to them. Places of worship lay in ruins. When humanity doesn't offer prayers to the gods, the power of gods wane, and ""Wrath of the Titans"" marks a turning point in the franchise. If the third entry in the ""Titans"" movie franchise—""Revenge of the Titans""--materializes, Zeus and company may appear only as memories. Presumably, Hades won't be able to summon another colossal beast from the bowels of the Underworld. Like its predecessor, ""Wrath of the Titans"" concerns fathers and sons as well as brother versus brother. We learn that Zeus and company endured quite a family feud that ended with them imprisoning their evil father Kronos in Tartarus. Essentially, Kronos constitutes the equivalent of the Kraken. Since all blockbusters try to top each other, ""Wrath of the Titans"" pits Perseus against Kronos. Kronos doesn't want to demolish a single city, but wipe out mankind. Whereas the Kraken was a giant sea beast, Kronos is a towering fire god. Basically, Kronos is a volcano come to life as a monster. Greek mythology, like most mythologies, tried to make sense out of the mysteries of nature. Scenarists Dan Mazeau, David Leslie Johnson, and Greg Berlanti make Kronos the equivalent of a lava-spewing volcano. A Kraken is a pretty formidable creature, but a glance at Kronos is enough to make you change your underwear, ancient or contemporary, a couple of times. Imagine what Hellboy would look like if he were the size of Optimus Prime from the ""Transformers"" movies and you'll have a good idea about how this fiend stacks up to our ordinary mortals.Perseus sets out with Poseidon's illegitimate offspring Agenor (Toby Kebbell of ""RocknRolla"") and Queen Andromeda (Pike) to save the world. Meanwhile, Hades double-crosses Zeus and imprisons him with the help of Ares (Édgar Ramírez of ""Domino"" in the Underworld. Our heroes embark on a scavenger hunt for items. Along the way, they confront the Cyclops and take a beating until they befriend them. Agenor helps Perseu find the fallen god Hephaestus (Bill Nighy of ""Underworld"") and he shows them the best what to enter Tartarus since he designed it. Eventually, Perseus learns that he must synthesize Zeus' Thunderbolt, Hades' Pitchfork, and Poseidon's Trident as a weapon to defeat Kronos. In ""Star Wars"" fashion, our protagonist must ride Pegasus down Kronos' gullet to dispense the fatal blow. ""Wrath of the Titans"" is hokum of a high order. The special efforts are stupendous. Perseus cuts his teeth on the Chimera, a two-headed, airborne beast with a multi-fanged snake head on its tale, and then tackles a couple of lead-footed Cyclops. The maze that Perseus blunders through is more interesting than the Minotaur that he dehorns. Liebesman does a good job of staging these battles and never lets the pace lag. Perseus looks pretty woebegone by the time he delivers the death blow to his adversary. ""Wrath of the Titans"" is marginally better than ""Clash of the Titans.""",Wrath of the Titans
12,Boba_Fett1138,Really nothing too bad.,6,2 April 2012,"It's normal for sequels to be inferior to its predecessors but I must say that the last couple of years sequels are only getting better and better and every so often also pass the original.That's also the case with ""Wrath of the Titans"", that is a sequel to the 2010 movie ""Clash of the Titans"". ""Clash of the Titans"" had all sorts of problems in it and while ""Wrath of the Titans"" is far from a flawless movie, it still is an improvement over the first movie.This movie was at least more focused with its story, which made it a more pleasant movie to follow. It's still not like I has a solid story in it and I didn't even really always knew what was going on exactly in it but it at least flows well and helps to make this movie a fun and mindless, action packed, blockbuster. It has a bigger budget than its predecessor but yet it doesn't look bigger or more expensive, which is only a positive thing to say really. It means that this movie has less tendencies to show off with some big action set pieces or CGI created creatures. Everything that happens in this movie fits better into its story and more often than not, serves a purpose within it as well. Besides, it looks as if this movie spend more of its budget on its set designs and other visual aspects, beside its special effects.Nevertheless, it remains still obvious that the foremost reason as to why this movie was such an expensive one to make was due to its special effects. But it all paid off! The special effects for the movie are simply great and help to make this movie often a spectacular and entertaining one.It also still would had been so much better if it actually was a more involving movie to watch. It never gets you a true sense of excitement or tension because you don't ever feel involved enough with any of its events or characters.I like that Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes get to do a bit more in this movie at times and don't just show up randomly every now and then, like still was the case with the first movie. They serve a more important purpose but still their roles aren't much bigger really. It's still somewhat disappointing seeing Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in this and the movie doing far too little with those two. Especially when you have an actor such as Ralph Fiennes playing a villainous role, you should definitely exploit this as a movie and do something more and better with it.The movie besides Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Sam Worthington, features mostly new characters and actors in it. And some of the actors and characters are a true welcome addition. Rosamund Pike and Bill Nighy are being the most notable ones.Really, it's not a bad movie or one that I hated watching. I still can't rate it very highly, simply because it's just nothing too great or involving to watch either. Anyway, chances are you will probably still end up liking it more than not.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Wrath of the Titans
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Nope, this one actually has Titans in it! I think?",7,2 April 2012,"Io has died off-screen, having fulfilled her role as the love interest for the first(and departing right after, as per the rules for the genre), leaving room for a romance(? right? I mean, it isn't actually present for most of this, if it is obvious that it will be there) between Andromeda(yup, that was why she wasn't the one in the first, so she'd be free to be it in this one) and Perseus, who is also left with a wimpy-looking(when doesn't he look scared?) son, Helius(there for emotional stakes and nothing else... early on, Mr. P dreams that they will both die, thus making this sequel that people are already wondering if they want to be watching a partial rip-off of Matrix Reloaded, one of the biggest follow-up letdowns in history... bad call). Humans are still not believing in the gods, and with them losing their power, Zeus is captured(his powers being drained, in order to help free Cronos), so our hero has to travel to and through the maze of Tartarus with female lead and Agenor(fellow halfdeity, son of Poseidon, starts out with personality(an obnoxious one, you think he might be the comic relief), soon after loses it, presumably to fit in with everyone else, since no one but Hades, his royal brother and the offspring of last-mentioned, Ares, have anything interesting in the way of character... actually, those three have good drama between them)), on a rescue mission. This is a thoroughly enjoyable mindless popcorn flick, well aware of what it is. There is some humor from a little of the dialog(when it isn't average and forgettable) and the role Hephaestus, played by a crazy Bill Nighy(so, nothing new there), who, as a hermit, has lost it completely. But what really works is the action, with several badass supernatural creatures, including cyclops', this two-headed firebreathing wolfthing, twin-torso swordwielding humanoid ones and this massive one made from lava. Heck, even the Olympus-dwellers get into it, and they are clearly far more powerful than the men. With only one exception, they are all established, built up and get as much screen-time and awesome combat as they should. This is paced remarkably well, it's never boring nor does it overwhelm you. The 3D is excellent, used in the right moments, when it wants to be epic. There is violent and disturbing content in this.

While there are a few more monstrosities including an island of Cyclops; a two-headed wolf-like creature and a mountainous cloud monster resembling the fire & brimstone creation in LORD OF THE RINGS & Disneys' ""Midnight on Bald Mountain"" demon the film is weighted down with very little 'thrills' nor any memorable dialogue or frivolity to add to the gloom and doom mix concocted by Dan Mazeau, David Johnson, Greg Berlanti and Dan Mazeau's screenplay and leaden direction by Jonathan Lliebesman outweighs the less-than-stellar (SIGH again!) 3-D employed (or rather lack of on screen!)",Wrath of the Titans
15,neil-476,Wrath or Clash? Only one can win...,7,5 April 2012,"After I had got over my irritation at standing behind young people asking for tickets for Rath Of The Titans (here in England, we pronounce the word ""Roth"", or at least we did until that poxy American-announced TV trailer appeared), I went in to see the sequel to the Clash Of The Titans remake from a couple of years ago.The plot concerns Perseus being drawn once more into some godly feuding, and serves no more purpose than to provide a vehicle on which to hang lots of CGI spectacle. Perseus is played, once more, by Sam Worthington, and I'm beginning to think that, as an actor, he looks hunky and that's about it. His Australian accent is particularly pronounced in this one. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes reprise their roles as Zeus and Hades, and Rosamund Pike takes over as Andromeda (poor old Io died between films). Harryhausen's Bubo - or rather an inanimate copy of him - puts in a cameo.This is big, noisy, flashy, undemanding fun and nonsense. The visuals are brilliantly put together, but there is nothing of real substance here. I enjoyed it though, and the 3D was quite good.",Wrath of the Titans
16,anaconda-40658,Wrath of Harryhausen!,6,29 May 2015,"Wrath of the Titans (2012): Dir: Jonathan Liebesman / Cast: Sam Worthington, Rosamund Pike, Edgar Ramirez, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes: A far superior film than that remake crap that proceeded it although it still pales in comparison to the 1981 original. This one follows the emerging presence of evil as the gods clash with Hades and his army, which leaves Zeus with his powers draining drastically in an effort to awaken the fire giant known as Kronos. This is an impressive and overwhelming creature that strikes fear into villagers with its charred and fire figure destroying more ground than any forest fire. There are numerous other creatures that enter the chaos that will prevail where the film becomes corny but the climatic showdown packs a mean punch. Sam Worthington redeems himself after the previous spectacle and portrays Perseus the demigod who has a son but must face off new obstacles. Like Lynn Collins in John Carter, Rosamnund Pike plays Andromeda as some sort of warrior in what comes off as some sort of gender joke that becomes forced as oppose to believable. Edgar Ramirez plays Ares, Zeus's other son who is jealous of his affection for Perseus. This results in a strong villain responsible for the chaos as well as provide a worthy adversary for Perseus. Liam Neeson displaying Zeus's weak side may be a mistake but it does bring more emotion to the role. Ralph Fiennes plays Hades but he isn't much more interesting than he was in the pathetic film that proceeded it. Visually superior sequel where the wrath comes from following a piece of crap to begin with. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Wrath of the Titans
17,FlashCallahan,You look ten thousand years younger.....,3,5 April 2012,"Perseus is attempting to live a quieter life as a fisherman and parent to his son, Helius.Dangerously weakened by humanity's lack of devotion, the gods are losing control of the imprisoned Titans and their ferocious leader, Kronos, father of the long-ruling brothers Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.The trio had overthrown their father long ago, leaving him to rot. Perseus cannot ignore his true calling when Hades make a deal with Kronos to capture Zeus.Enlisting the help of the warrior Queen Andromeda and Poseidon's son, Perseus bravely embarks on a treacherous quest into the underworld to rescue Zeus, and save mankind.....Like he did last year, Liebbesmann or however you spell his name, starts the blockbuster year off with an almighty whimper. Battle: Los Angeles was awful, and this is just as bad.The cast are mostly back, but some just look embarrassed, and the main character is played by someone who is devoid of any talent, but has starred in some of the biggest films in the last three years.The man cannot carry a movie, and whenever he isn't on screen with Neeson, Fiennes or Kebbel, the film just falters and becomes boring.I was hoping for a film that would just consist of walking, fighting monsters, walking, fighting monsters and so on, but nothing could prepare me for the awful script and the lack of plot.People should know now that no , matter how good the effects are, or what seasoned British actors are in it (Nighy does an excellent Davy Jones again), it doesn't make up for the lack of interest the story or narrative has.On the plus side, the 3D is better than the first.....And you just know that wooden sword will be included in the finale.A waste of time.",Wrath of the Titans
18,phd_travel,Terrible story - the Gods must be spinning on Mount Olympus,1,30 March 2012,The story is absolute rubbish. Anyone with the slightest knowledge of mythology would cringe at the terrible things they made the Gods do. There are so many bad things about the plot.1. How could they make Ares and Hades fight against Zeus and then make Hades change sides for hardly any reason? 2. How could they make Zeus die? 3. Why is Perseus speaking with an Australian accent? Come on Sam at least fake something neutral! 4. Since when did Andromeda become some tomboy warrior amazon? 5. Why would Ares be jealous of that silly little fisherman Perseus when all he was doing was fishing? What pointless animosity. Since when were the Gods thugs?6. Why is Pegasus so dark?I thought the 2010 Clash was a terrible remake of the 80s version. The 2010 Clash had no charm romance or dignity of the Gods. But Wrath is worse. The story is so rubbishy and the dialog so terrible that it's gone light years away from the right direction. The acting and casting aren't good. Rosamund Pike isn't appealing enough for a princess. Her cold blank expression is annoying. Sam Worthington looks even more nondescript let alone heroic than before. He isn't even 1 percent God. And why did he start speaking in his native accent? Are the Gods from Down Under? And the sudden kiss at the end is so out of place even Andromeda looked shocked. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are too good to be in this bad movie.Don't watch this one - it's an example of silly people just throwing money away on effects when the plot stinks.,Wrath of the Titans

I probably should have just stayed home. This sequel is perhaps just a tad better than the previous one. The 3D is at least not post-converted (though it's not very good, either). Sam Worthington is still one of Hollywood's dullest actors. The special effects are again pretty good. The Chimaera battle is actually quite good, as is the sequence with the Cyclopes. The finale isn't bad, either, though the Minotaur sequence is a huge disappointment. There are occasionally good images. I especially loved the design of the Labyrinth.

Just kidding, but everybody agreed that Clash was all about the effects and a hollow script. Here we do have a bit of the same but we are two years further into flicks about the Gods and Greek mythology. There's more action going on and there's even a spot of the red stuff to notice here and there. Due the success of Clash they add millions more here towards the CGI and story but it still doesn't work completely. I don't know what the real problem is, there's a lot of action, in that part I agree but maybe the script failed again. The acting was mediocre and again I wasn't into any of the characters. An epic movie with great action and bad script. It's slightly better than it's predecessor. But still it's a mess with a lot of faults against the ancient Greek mythology.

21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Wrath of the Titans,7,29 March 2012,"Once bitten, twice shy. I suppose the really bad 3D effects in the Clash of the Titans remake two years ago made me steer really clear of yet another post-production 3D conversion effort in this follow up sequel, and going by the looks of it, there isn't really much to provide that depth of field, nor effort in the way it's shot to exploit the 3D format, other than to rake in extra dollars since the 2010 version did so to have green lit this total imaginary Greek mythology scribed by Greg Berlanti, David Johnson and Dan Mazeau, who between them have written stuff like Green Lantern, Orphan, and Red Riding Hood. But one thing's for sure, gone is the direction and focus on pure action, and in comes a semblance of a stronger storyline.The theme about fathers and sons cannot be more pronounced in Wrath of the Titans, set 10 years after the first film, that harks back to the Greek mythology origins of the splitting of powers between Zeus (Liam Neeson), Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston) when they condemn their father Cronos into the depths of Hell, and Zeus having to play Hades out by making the latter lord of the underworld. So the balance of power has remained as such, until Zeus walks into a trap as planned by Hades and Zeus' son Ares (Edgar Ramirez) the god of War because of his jealousy of Perseus (Sam Worthington), the new favoured son of Zeus. With Zeus entrapped to sap his life force and powers for Cronos, the plan is to release Cronos back into the world to destroy everything in the known universe.The saviour is of course demi god Perseus, who now is a father to Helius (John Bell), his son with now deceased wife Io, conveniently written out because of Gemma Arterton's non participation, and to steer the romance in this fable back to between Perseus and Queen Andromeda, who's now Warrior Queen and played by Rosamund PIke. And Perseus can't save the world alone because he's only a half-god up against the might of Ares, Hades and Cronos, so he has to team up with another demi god, the son of Poseidon, Agenor (Toby Kebbell), who will lead them to Hephaestus (Bill Nighy), who holds the key to safe passage to the Underworld where Zeus is imprisoned. The quest this time, as you can see, is kept quite linear and straightforward, which makes it extremely easy to follow as the dots get connected in the most simplest of fashion, keeping in constant reminder of the theme that deals with the squabbles between family members, and fights between envious siblings.And not only is the story kept simple, the battle scenes here were also cleanly designed without complication, unleashing new beasts yet to be seen in the Clash of the Titans film, involving ugly two-headed hounds from hell, battles with one eyed cyclops, and of course, big daddy himself who seemed more smoke and mirrors, especially since the strategy involves something that's very close to Star Wars' destruction of the Death Star. I can't fathom why there are so many complaints about the big minotaur fight unless you're watching the film really close to the screen. Some easter eggs continue from the first film, such as the presence of mechanical owl Bubo, and Pegasus having a little bit more personality though still sidelined as being nothing more than air transportation.Sam Worthington looked like he's enjoying much of the adventures of Perseus this time round, playing the man who walked away from his new found fame as the Kraken slayer, to return once again from his life of being a simple fisherman, and taking up arms and fight to save the world against the titans in the film (collectively inclusive of the other monsters in the film). With the gods severely weakened because nobody prays to them, the role of Perseus and Agenor, for slight comic relief, may pave the door to follow up films that deal more with demi gods than those residing in Mount Olympus. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes had a lot more to do here also in expanded roles, with the final act providing the opportunity for one last hurrah that is surprisingly moving.Perhaps the miscast here would be Rosamund Pike's Andromeda, with the idea of a Warrior Queen being a departure from Andromeda's usual role of the damsel in distress, but this film still being more testosterone suited instead. She doesn't get to do much given her very human abilities, and is there as token romantic interest with a romance that isn't strong to begin with, coupled with a sagging mid-section that involves hallucination en route to the Underworld that got abandoned before it even begun for her character. Her troopers too in the final battle scene didn't get to do much despite much posturing for nothing, and were relegated to mere cheer leaders for the most part, grateful that someone else had stepped up to the plate and did their fighting for them instead.Still, if compared to the rather disastrous Clash of the Titans 2 years ago, Wrath of the Titans is a leg up in terms of storytelling, and didn't have an albatross of the superbly nostalgic 1981 version hanging around its neck to be compared to. The fights also didn't get obsessed with wanting to be bigger, faster and more CG-laden, and the combination of a more focused plot and theme, with better designed battles that adhered to the mantra of keeping it simple, proved to be a winner for this follow up. Recommended for being that far out, imaginary modern take on Greek mythology that played on the what-if scenario.",Wrath of the Titans
22,siderite,A big disappointment,5,15 July 2012,"I never thought of Clash of the Titans much, but I liked it. It had a story based on Greek Mythology, many interesting characters, great visuals. I thought Wrath of the Titans should be as fun, but I was wrong. There is Greek myth, but almost all of it has already been used in the first film. There are some interesting, but only a few; most of them are part of the godly dysfunctional family and are pretty cardboard. There are great visuals, but grand in scale, rather than subtlety; you could have actually see where they skimped on the budget.So all in all, instead of another movie based on Greek mythology, you get a film based on the previous film. Add more American bravado, a lot of useless violence and then cut a bit of the costs and make it a franchise and you have a win. A shame.",Wrath of the Titans

24,Rainey-Dawn,Action Packed Sequel - It Is A Little Better,7,17 January 2017,"I do agree that this sequel is better than the 2010 Clash of the Titans. I find the special effects better, acting better, the story better (*1981 Clash's story was a bit different than the 2010). I am surprised I like this film a little better than the 2010 Clash. Even the overall look and feel to this sequel is somewhat better. It's dirtier and gritter. I will admit that I'm not fond of those double sided monsters though - they were a bit goofy looking lol... but I am pleased with the rest of the creatures for the most part. It seems they took more a little bit more time with this film... but maybe it just appears that way to me.Anyway, I like the 1981 best, this film is seconded on my rating list and 2010 Wrath takes third place. The 2010 Clash and 2012 Wrath does give me something different to watch.One more note: to me, Kronos is very much like the Balrog from LotR. I kept expecting Gandalf to yell ""You shall not pass!"".

25,KineticSeoul,Hands-down better than the previous one,6,4 June 2012,"When I first saw ""Clash of the Titans"" I thought ""man Hollywood is running out of ideas"" although that though crossed my mind multiple times before. But this sequel is somewhat fresh and a bit innovative, at least compared to the 2010 version of ""Clash of the Titans"". Which for some may not being saying much but to put it simply this is what the first one should have been, especially with the hype and all. It's not a amazing movie or a very epic one but it's still watchable and at least entertaining and not boring all the way through like the previous movie in this franchise. The CGI is better this time around as well even if the previous movie was alright but had some crappy CGI parts as well, the scorpion scene for one. This time around Zeus actually sides with Perseus and his cause and for good reason for Zeus though. The scene with the combining of opposites is just really cool to watch. The plot in this is basically Hades and Ares team up to release Kronos because of what happened in the previous movie the mythological gods are very weak and is capable of dying. What really stood out to me about this movie is the unpredictable nature of the characters and even the ending was unpredictable. Overall this is a worthy sequel that is better than the previous one.6.8/10",Wrath of the Titans
26,OllieSuave-007,Wrath is ordinary.,6,8 May 2014,"A sequel to 2010's Clash of the Titans, Perseus (Sam Worthington) returns on a quest to save the world from the Titans, who have been unleashed by the treacherous Ares (Edgar Ramirez) and Hades (Ralph Fiennes), and rescue the betrayed Zeus (Liam Neeson).This movie is filmed in non-stop adventure and action, with some great visual effects and spot-on acting. In addition to Zeus and Hades, other Olympian Gods were given more screen time in this film than its prequel, including Ares, Hephaestus, Poseidon and Athena, which I think contributes more to the mythology element of the film. However, I thought this movie suffers from a more concrete and significant story. Much of the film is consumed in CGI action, leaving few room for an original story that would actually compel an audience. While the action is good, the simple plot about Persesus trying to rescue Zeus and then trying to battle the Gods and the Titans on the side is pretty ordinary, leaving us with an average film.If you want a movie full of nothing but battle scenes, than this film is for you. If you want a movie that has a unique and original plot with more substance and drama, you wouldn't find much of that here. Overall, I didn't find the movie boring, I just wasn't blown away by it.

27,Hellmant,The Wrath of the Boring Filmmaker!,5,1 May 2012,"'WRATH OF THE TITANS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 2010 hit remake of the 1981 cult classic fantasy film based on the myth of Perseus and his battles with Medusa and the Kraken monster. This film is set ten years after the original and once again pits Perseus against evil gods and monsters. Sam Worthington returns as Perseus and Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes and Danny Huston all reprise their roles as gods. This one was written by Dan Mazeau and David Johnson and directed by Jonathan Liebesman (who also directed such B Sci-Fi and horror films as 'BATTLE LOS ANGELES', 'THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING' and 'DARKNESS FALLS'). The movie looks great but other than that it's a bore.The movie is set a decade after the original when demigod Perseus is trying to raise his son alone, after losing his wife (but it's never explained how). When Perseus's father Zeus (Neeson) is imprisoned by his other son Ares (Edgar Ramirez) and brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) it's once again up to Perseus to save the world. The two plot to unleash the evil Titans and due to lack of faith the powers of the good gods are once again weakened. Zeus must of course go on an epic journey in to the underworld and do battle with the evil gods again.The movie is excruciatingly slow paced and devoid of any emotion or involving plot points. The characters are developed to the bare minimum and I could have cared less what happened to any of them (I found my attention drifting often). Still it looked great.

28,thesar-2,Laugh at the Titans,2,1 April 2012,"On a side note, Wrath of the Titans stars the hunk of a man, Édgar Ramírez, whom I first noticed, albeit briefly, in The Bourne Ultimatum.That's it. That's pretty much all I have to say positive about this 1970s adventure made with today's technology.Okay, fine, most of the graphics and cinematography were pretty well done – not the 3D, mind you, which sucked, as usual as of late. And I would be lying if I didn't say, for the majority of the time, I was impressed with the technology. It sure as hell beats the crap out of the first one, the 2010 remake. (God – ironically enough – I remember laughing my arse off at Zeus's Glow-in-the-Dark dress.)The movie seemed rushed, the script all over the place, the actors bored and confused and the point of the film sprouted in so many directions, even the Titans, themselves, never knew when they were supposed to make their entrance. I'm probably not too far off since this was most definitely rushed into production the minute the remake made some good bucks in its opening weekend.If you look at the movie from a distance, it would be unfair if I said it was the worst I've seen, this year or any. And even though barely any scene actually worked, or hardly any character was minutely interesting enough to give a more positive review, one could do a lot worse. I say ""hardly"" as Hades (Ralph Fiennes,) this time, that is, was a bright spot. Go on, give me hell for that one.Let's see if I can sum up the experience I just had: Fairly weak gods to begin with are now even weaker because despite everyone (in this universe) knows they exist, no one's praying to them. If their power reduces further, bad demons may/may not – depending upon what version you see of this – roam the Earth and that's the end of man/god-kind.Meanwhile, the so-called powerful god of gods, Zeus (the disappointing Liam Neeson) gets locked up in Hades and his power is needed to release his dad, a baddie of fire and arm motions. Meanwhile, Perseus (the bored Sam Worthington) is trying to keep his incredibly, and unintentionally, hilarious son close while fishing. Meanwhile, he needs to go somewhere to pick up another half god/half loser to venture to get someone to guide them to hell and back while hell comes back on its own.Oh, and there's a queen, an army and out-there jealousy and hatred. Did I get most of it at least?Blasted. I forgot the threesome of giant Cyclops that literally looked like enlarged white Shreks on the screen. Thatmade me burst out into laughter.The movie is just not worth it. Again, it's not the worst I've seen, it's thankfully short, although it feels longer, and it matches (minus special effects) any 70s throw-way adventure/fantasy sequel you might have grown up with/loved. I wouldn't even wait for home video. Just watch the trailer and know (SPOILER) good prevails.I saved you money and time. You're welcome.",Wrath of the Titans
29,bowmanblue,Land of beards and accents,6,6 December 2014,"If you watched the remake of Clash of the Titans then you should know what to expect. I.e. your expectations of its sequel, Wrath of the Titans, should be suitable lowered. And, baring that in mind, you may just enjoy it... may.After the events in Clash, Perseus has finally succumbed the fashion of the day and let his hair grow out. Sadly his wife has died and he's left to bring up his son alone. However, when your dad is the most powerful God in all Olympus, then adventure is never far away. Zeus, played by Liam Neeson, despite being all powerful... gets taken. Instead of going on a killing spree around Europe he finds himself being chained up in the underworld by his evil (other) son and his evil brother so that they may bring back his evil father to power (Zeus has a lot of evil relatives). Therefore Perseus, being the only man in Greece without facial hair, must rescue his dad before he's turned into Father Christmas (see the make-up on Zeus near the end).It's nothing new, but it ticks along okay. Every fifteen minutes or so we're treated to another big monster for Perseus to fight. Every character plays their part well enough (and with a different accent - who'd have thought there were so many different accents in ancient Greece? Special mention to Bill Nighy who has the thickest Yorkshire accent in all times past). Perseus is naturally helped out by a tough, hard-as-nails fighting woman (Rosamund Pike) and a cheery comic relief-type character who is the long lost son of Poseidon.After watching Wrath, I found it hard to actually hate anything about it. It ticks all the boxes. It has action, monsters, a bit of love interest and that's that. However, it just felt like an 'action film by the numbers.' Just like I couldn't think of anything bad to say about it, I couldn't really find anything good to say about it either. It simply exists as a film. When it ended I didn't really feel any emotion at all.Not a waste of ninety-five minutes, but hardly the best use of my time.

30,g-bodyl,Unnecessary But A......Fun Sequel!,8,24 November 2013,"Wrath of the Titans, the sequel to 2010's Clash of the Titans, joins the ranks of most unnecessary sequels/prequels, but I feel this film is not necessarily a cash-grab. While not really improving on the first film, this film still offers up some goodies that would satisfy any Greek mythology fan or even any action-fantasy fan. The story is decent, the acting is decent, but the special effects are a vast improvement over the predecessor.Jonathan Liebesman's film marks the return of Perseus, son of Zeus. After a fallout with his father and a vow to retire to raise a family, he gets called back into action when both the immortals and mankind are being threatened by Kronos himself.The acting is not too bad, but nothing special. It's relatively on par with the first film. Sam Worthington is okay even though he seems a bit wooden at times. The real deal goes to Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes who are great in their respective roles as Zeus and Hades. I also like how then add some successful comedy in the nature of Toby Kebbell.Overall, I would like to call this film a guilty pleasure of mine just like Clash of the Titans. While not a bad movie like everyone else said it was, I thought it was a fun ride and something you won't have to think about. There is plenty of old-school action mixed with some cool CGI. I kind of hope they make a third film, because I find these kind of films interesting. I rate this film 8/10.",Wrath of the Titans

I say B+,8,12 June 2012,"""The time of the Gods is ending but the son of Zeus cannot hide from his destiny forever."" Perseus (Worthington) is doing is best to forget his old life and make it without the help of any of the Gods. Perseus is not the only one trying to make it alone and the Gods are beginning to lose control of the Titans. When Zeus' (Neeson) other son Ares teams with Hades to take control and kidnaps Zeus and imprisons him in Hell there is only one who can rescue him. I have to start by saying I have never been a fan of movies like this. I couldn't get into ""Clash Of The Titans"", ""Immortals"", or even ""300"". I say that so I can say that this was very entertaining and I really enjoyed this one a lot. Not only was this action packed with great effects the story was actually entertaining as well. There is enough mythology for purists, but not too much to scare off people like me. Another amazing thing about this one is that it is a rare sequel that is better then the first one. While this is not really a movie you have to pay attention to the entire time or you are lost it is still a very entertaining movie and it is fun and relaxing to watch something like this every once in a while.

33,ironhorse_iv,"This movie got a lot of wrath from movie goers, but not from me.",6,4 June 2013,"In my opinion, this movie is a lot better than the 2010's Clash of the Titans. Left watching it thinking it was alright and wasn't too angry by it like the previous movie did. It was little bit more entertaining. Not as bad as the last movie, but not as good as the 1981's Clash of the Titans. At less, this movie finally had an Clash with a Titan. Where are the other titans in this movie? Where is Atlas, Prometheus, or Oceanus? That would be cool to see them. I didn't like the titans portray as a mindless monsters. The plot read like this, a decade has passed since the events of the last movie, and now Perseus (Sam Worthington) is living his days as a local fisherman after the death of his wife Io (Gemma Arteton). I know Gemma Arterton wasn't available to return, but the movie does little to no explaining why Io is dead. She was cursed with agelessness, so she had to meet her demise somehow and why couldn't her death fit into the plot. They could have use her death as a reason for Perseus to fight against the titan. However, I think the writer were smart to write her off as in the true mythology, Andromeda (Rosamunde Pike) was Perseus's wife. I think they were trying to correct that mistake they made with the first film. The character Io was already major deviation from Greek mythology. Anyways, Perseus is once again, call for arms when war with the titans is coming and there is no more Greek Gods to protect them, because no one is praying to them anymore. Hades (Ralph Fiennes) ever the cunning, has come up with a plan to keep immortality: team up with Ares (Edgar Ramirez) and make a deal with Kronos and sacrifice Zeus (Liam Neelson). Perseus must enter Tartarus and bring together Zeus' Thunderbolt, Hades' pitchfork and Poseidon's trident to make the Spear of Traim to defeat Kronos once and for all. The action in the film was pretty good in my opinion. The 3D post converted for the most part, better than 2010's Clash of the Titans. Still, the 3D doesn't add anything to the story. Nothing really jumps out. The acting was mediocre at best. Sam Worthington seems to care less if his Australian accent is showing on screen, as most of the time, you don't see him give any genuine emotion. I don't really care about his hairdo, like some critics do. I think it's just nitpicking. Rosamund Pike's Andromeda is hot and okay, she was a lot better than Alexa Davalos in my opinion. I didn't mind the Xena like turn to her character as much as the others. Still, they didn't really pump out the romance with Perseus and Andromeda throughout the movie, but I was pleased we at least got a kiss at the end. I don't like how Poseidon is downplay (Danny Huston) to the point, that Zeus doesn't care about what happen to him in the beginning, and toward the end of the film, teams up with one of the people that help killed him. That was pretty sappy. Poseidon was a big villain in the original Greek myth and seeing him misused is horrible. Toby Kebbell as Agenor was pretty funny, and his character work out. Bill Nighy, of all people, playing an madman Yorkshire accent version of Hephaestus. I would have love him in a more sinister role. The music soundtrack was alright. Overall: It's a way improvement from Clash of the Titans. Nothing about the film stood out for me, but at less, the fight with Kronos last longer than that horrible short fight with the Kraken in the last movie. I'm probably thinking too much into this film. Its popcorn flick fantasy film. It doesn't have to be historically accurate, its not Greek mythology class. In my opinion, if you like Greek mythology, but not too crazy about it. Then go see this movie.",Wrath of the Titans
34,The-Sarkologist,"Watchable, Enjoyable, but not really necessary",6,1 April 2012,"I sort of wonder whether it was really necessary to actually make a sequel to Clash of the Titans, particularly since in Greek Mythology there was really no sequel to the story of Perseus and Andromeda. Well, at least in this movie we see Pereus get together with Andromeda as opposed to Io (though we discover at the beginning of the film that Io had died, though in the previous film she had been cursed with immortality).In a way it seemed like the filmmakers watch Immortals, realised that it was absolute rubbish, and decided to show them how to really make such a film. However, my comments on Immortals applies equally to this film. First of all it is not based on a Greek myth. There is not story about how certain gods wanted to release the Titans back into the world. It might make an entertaining Hollywood movie but it is hardly something that a lover of Greek culture is going to appreciate.This was an enjoyable film with great action and good special effects. In a way it was much better than Immortals, if only for the better use of scenery and a more realistic approach to what Greece looks like. They even go for a journey into Tartarus, and once again this Tartarus was much better than the one in Immortals. However there is also the question of the God's dying. Pretty much every god that appears in the film either dies or becomes mortal. However we only see the male gods, I have no idea what happened to the female gods.Then there is this silly idea that humanity is turning their backs on the gods. I'm sorry that is simply not what the Greeks would have done. The Greeks were very religious and superstitious people. They would be forever offering sacrifices and libations to the god, and forever seeking guidance from them. The city of Delphi, known as the naval of the Earth, was an incredibly religious place, as was the island of Delos. This does not sound like a people who where turning their backs on the gods.Maybe it is because we are trying to appeal to a Western audience, one that many of the Hollywood liberals believe are seeking to live without a spiritual world. This is annoying and in a way I can understand the accusations of liberalism that the Christians in the United States level at them. This is also something that we are seeing in Europe as well, however if you travel to the southern parts you will find that the people are still incredibly religious.As a film though it was enjoyable and watchable, however I am unlikely to want to look much beyond it. Personally, now that I have watched it and commented on it, I feel that I can now put these two movies behind me and move on to some bigger and better things.",Wrath of the Titans
35,paulclaassen,WRATH might just be better than CLASH.,6,23 January 2021,"Chaos and mayhem from beginning to end result in loads - and loads! - of action. 'Wrath of Titans' delivers non-stop action, thrills, adventure and excitement. Despite near universal negative reviews from critics, I found 'Wrath' rather entertaining. (And, as it turns out, was a box office success).Just like 'Clash of the Titans', 'Wrath' is heavy on CGI, but the action sequences are mind blowing. Blending CGI with real life blends seamlessly. In 'Clash of the Titans' it wasn't believable why the gods needed help from the humans. However now, with the gods losing their powers - and even dying - due to lack of prayers from humans, it is more credible why they need humanity's help.Narrow-minded Christians - and other religious people - might view the film as blasphemous, but keep in mind this is set in a time when people believed in gods (not God or Jesus), so they should consider this when going into the movie.The underworld - and labyrinth - is an impressively designed spectacle, and in my opinion the film's highlight. Regarding the characters, I enjoyed the different characteristics, views, opinions, and beliefs. Bill Nighy - although in a fairly small role - is excellent as always. Sam Worthington is once again worthy of being the protagonist, Perseus, although at times he is overshadowed by the many other protagonists in the film. Nevertheless, 'Wrath of the Titans' scores high on an entertainment level. The film's score is also beautiful and dramatic. The finale features spectacular action and incredible visuals. I loved it!",Wrath of the Titans
36,filipemanuelneto,"Lots of action and CGI, stinking fake, without any good plot behind.",3,27 December 2017,"I'm always afraid of sequels. I'm not the only one, there are even several actors who don't like it. This film explains the reason: the're almost always worse than the previous film which, in this case, wasn't particularly good. And although I realize that the title is a reference to an older film (that is, this is a sequel to a remake), it remains a poor choice for a title, but that's the least relevant criticism here. If the first film seemed insipid and filled script failures with a CGI avalanche, it had at least the virtue of having a history closely related to Greek mythology. This movie lost that, preferring to create something new that gave continuity to the previous story. It's a legitimate choice... but it failed squarely.The plot takes place ten years after the events of ""Clash of the Titans"". Perseus lives a mortal life with his son when he's called by his father, Zeus, the king of the gods, to aid in a problem with the instability of the walls of Tartarus. Soon after, this problem disappears, no one ever talks about it, and the gods turn against each other in an internal war, when Perseus will participate to avoid the return of Cronus, a primordial god, father of Zeus, and basically prevent the end of the world. I found this highly predictable plot plodded like a bad patchwork. A disaster completed with insipid and uninspired dialogues, several cliches reused from other action epics (the use of slow motion in battle scenes, for example), and such an amateur editing and post-production work which seem to have been done by trainees, in their first fifteen days of office! It's perfectly clear, throughout the film, a brutal pace difference, with moments where everything happens very quickly and others where the action creeps like honey in the Summer. If we cannot blame editors for these pace differences, we can only point the finger at the awkward director Jonathan Liebesman, who perhaps did better by dedicating his time to filming home movies with puppies. It should be noted that neither he, nor the scriptwriting team, had any part, as far as I could tell, of the previous film.About the cast I can say that there are great actors who manage, with great talent and dedication, to make the film not a total waste of time. Liam Neeson is flawless and delivers clean service to the audience; Ralph Fiennes did a good job, perhaps even better than in the previous film; Sam Worthington seems to have learned from the mistakes he made in the previous film but remains stupid and presumptuous; Bill Nighy was very good and gives some light moments and situational comedy; Alexa Davalos gave way to Rosamund Pike, who made a nimble and brave queen, something that I really enjoyed because she's a talented actress who only used to do unemotional and cold characters.The film reproduced the formula ""if the script does not work, drown it with CGI and action to make it work"". When will filmmakers realize that CGI has become ordinary? It's no longer possible to build a good movie only with lots of visuals and brutal action scenes. There needs to be a good story behind all that, and this movie just doesn't have it. I could tell about the unrealistic way I watch the fight scenes, as this seemed to me totally choreographed... but even that loses relevance if script's not there. It's a movie that isn't worth watching more than once, just to see how bad it is.",Wrath of the Titans
37,digitalbeachbum,Hollowood will never learn,1,8 August 2020,"Taking classic characters from ancient stories and then warping the meaning of those characters and the moral lessons that are supposed to be learned, is a lost art and Hollowood isn't ever going to learn the lessons.Wrath of the Titans is a sequel to Clash of the Titans, which was a remake of a classic from the 80's, which sucked only because the special effects were not so good (except for the classic stop-motion of Harryhausen)Wrath isn't worth my time any further. It sucked on all levels.",Wrath of the Titans
38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Like a purposeless, poorly written video game",3,21 August 2012,"""Wrath of the Titans"" really captures the spirit of its 2010 predecessor — that spirit being uninspired and underdeveloped. If the goal was not to work on improving the quality of the sequel, Warner Bros. succeeded.While the action improves in the hands of director Jonathan Liebesman (""Battle: Los Angeles""), the sequences are still equally as contrived and shallow. New writers Dan Mazeau and David Johnson also appear to use the script of ""Clash of the Titans"" as a bible of some sort for constructing their film, using overly grandiose dialogue much like the first did to convey horribly obvious foreshadowing and to bash us over the head with themes relating to our hero's journey.Even those who did enjoy the first film will find ""Wrath's"" story to blatantly disregard the events that preceded it. The film takes place several years after ""Clash"" and we find Perseus (Sam Worthington) has been raising a son he had with Io, who definitely died before giving birth to anything in the first movie. Anyway, Perseus, who the series continues to play as this annoyingly reluctant hero, has determined to live life as a fisherman and ignore his demi-god power. When Zeus (Liam Neeson) comes to Perseus and warns him the gods are losing their immortal power due to humans not praying to them anymore, Perseus tries to push it out of his mind. Then all hell breaks loose, rather literally.Zeus is crossed and captured by his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and son Ares (Edgar Ramirez). The plan is to offer him to their father, the imprisoned titan, Cronos, in exchange for assured immortality. This starts a chain reaction of monsters being unleashed from the Underworld and upon the Earth. The god Poseidon (Danny Huston) charges Perseus with traveling to the Underworld and saving Zeus, though he must arbitrarily seek out some people and things to get there.""Wrath"" essentially makes up the rules of its Greek mythological world, creating a situation in which gods are mortal yet can't seem to just obliterate each other. It's a grittier portrayal than ""Clash,"" in which the gods wore shiny armor and came off as theatrical, but with the PG-13 rating, they comically slug each other (and humans) with their transforming weapons.Most video games are more exciting and entertaining than ""Wrath of the Titans"" — and their story lines make more sense too. Although even the dialogue clearly states Perseus must go from Point A to Point B, the story creates all these intentional roadblocks that feel like obligatory stops on the way to the grand finale vs. Cronos rather than points along the journey that develop the story and especially the characters. We meet up with Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and Agenor (Toby Kebbell) to make things more colorful, not out of necessity. Pike is clearly above this material yet is polite enough to do everything she can to make the dialogue convincing. At one point she passionately pleas that Hephaestus (Bill Nighy) help them enter the prison Tartarus to find Zeus. It would be a nice speech in a film in which anyone cared about what was going on, or was actually convinced Hephaestus might not eventually have a change of heart.Kebbell is meant to provide comic relief as Agenor, son of Poseidon, who is painted as a lazy liar — a Jack Sparrow-type character — yet despite plenty of warnings in the script, never turns on our hero and never appears to pursue his own interests. In terms of the humor, it works in touches here and there, but almost all the jokes in the film completely backfire, especially an awkwardly self-aware reference to Neeson's famed ""Clash"" line ""release the kraken!""Liebesman's on-the-ground, guerilla style works in the first major action scene in which Perseus fights a three-headed, winged take on a chimera, but it doesn't work as well in the more fantastical set pieces that follow. The CGI works well and there's interesting stuff to look at, but it's all meat and no bones. The cyclops fight scene has some great in-your-face qualities, but for some reason Liebesman is fond of really hammering that quality home by having all the monsters drooling on each other or the human characters. Most of the battles are random, especially a scene in the labyrinth of Tartarus in which its unclear whether or not Perseus fights the Minotaur, a beast that resembles Lou Ferrigno with horns. He's dispatched quickly and the quest to find Zeus continues as if nothing happened. Again, like a video game, the fights come off like mini boss battles at best.""Wrath of the Titans"" mostly comes off as apathetic. Scenes, characters and sequences are rolled in and out without any concern for being convincing, yet the dialogue is written as if all of it has in fact been convincing. In its defense, ""Wrath"" is a quick and painless exercise, but even its most basic entertainment value can't overcome its absolute purposelessness.~Steven CThanks for reading!

I mean the effects are great, but the characters and story(or lack of) was so bland to the max. How does Wrath of the Titans hold up.Sam Worthington is as wooden, has he was in Clash, I wanted to scream, show some emotion. Rosamund Pike, who I always enjoy watching, but seems very miscast as Andromeda, she looks more like Andromedas daughter or kid sister.

40,freemantle_uk,A massive improvement upon the original!,7,27 July 2013,"The 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans was a critical failure but it made money, which resulted with the big wigs at Warner Brothers to produce a sequel no one wanted. It was made even worst when Jonathan Liebesman, the director of the awful Battle Los Angeles, was hired to make this sequel. But Wrath of the Titans is a much better film to the 2010 version and solves some of the problems of the original.10 years after the events of Clash of the Titans Perseus (Sam Worthington) lives a simple live with his son Helius (John Bell) after the death of his wife Io. But problems are occurring in the world of the Gods as they are losing their powers due to humans no longer worshipping them and many of them have died. Even worst the walls of Tartarus, the prison holding the titan Kronos, are crumbling and when Zeus (Liam Neeson) and Poseidon (Danny Huston) seek Hades' (Ralph Fiennes) help they are betrayed Hades and Ares (Edgar Rameriz) betray them and plan to let Kronos loose on the world. It is up to Perseus, Queen Andromeda of Argos (Rosamund Pike) and Poseidon's demi-god son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) to save Zeus and stop Kronos.Wrath of the Titans is a by-the-numbers fantasy film, but it does have a scene of fun and a solid adventure into Greek mythology. Wrath of the Titans does follow a similar path of to Clash of the Titans as our group of heroes have to go on a quest to find a weapon to stop an impending threat, the writing and progression of the sequel was a lot more natural. It could easily be argued that Wrath of the Titans has a video style plotting of the characters having to a bigger and harder level but there are no real deus ex machina this time round where are characters are saved in the nick of time.There is a general improvement across the board and the film has a greater scene of fun. The comedy relief is an upgrade with Agenor basically being a Jack Sparrow esque rogue and Bill Nighy was highly entertaining as Hephaestus, a fallen God who has become insane and argues with himself, using his Davy Jones voice. There is also an update in the acting for the most part, with Neeson and Fiennes actually seem invested in their performances and there were given a little more depth compared to their previous incarnations. This is especially the case with Fiennes' version of Hades who is someone who felt betrayed and feared death and was more then just the de facto villain he is normally in modern versions of Greek mythology.Liebesman does show great competent with the CGI and he has improved a lot with his action direction. Whilst his hand held approach is not the most suitable and he does have a tendency to over edit his fight scenes, you can at least comprehend what was happening and there was creative creature designs throughout the film. Some action sequences were better then others, the worst being a fight in the labyrinth into the underworld where Perseus fights a Minotaur in a scene that was too heavily edit and too dark to see anything. The action is solid for the most part, particular the first fight scenes and the final battle and the fight with Ares in massive presence simply for being a God and there is very little that could stop him. He was a solid villain.Worthington was sadly wooden as ever and his performances in Terminator Salvation and Avatar seem to be flukes at this point. Wrath of the Titans also brisks along a very pace and only has a 90 minute running time; there is no time to fresh out the world and there are problems with the army scenes because the army looked a lot smaller then it was meant to be.Wrath of the Titans is not going to be a film that will set the world alight but it is a solid enough fantasy adventure which is worth checking out if you are already interested in seeing it. It is much better then a sequel to a poor film should have been and its IMDb score of 5.7/10 is a little harsh. A 6.5/10 would have been more fitting.",Wrath of the Titans
41,strong-122-478885,"It's A ""Been There/Done That"" Titan-Style Wrath",3,30 September 2013,"(Yawn!) Well, here we go again!Yep. Here's yet another badly reworked, uninspiring tale-of-the-gods (ha!) that's only worth watching for its fantastic CG visuals (and nothing else) - And, to be completely honest here - After just a short while these extraordinary images got mighty tiresome to look at, as well.I don't know about you, but, I, for one, am pretty damn sick and tired of movies that deal with the ancient gods (and their bastard, demigod sons) and all of their sheer pettiness, resentment, hatred and bitter jealousy that they all seem to hold towards one another.I am so completely fed up with how utterly uninspiring these adored and respected ones are and how nauseating and so very-very ""human"" (that's right - Human!) that these revered gods, and their likes, turn out to be.I literally despise them in all of their entirety. Their personalities all suck to the 10th power and their interaction with one another is contemptible beyond words.And, on top of all of the above complaining - I also thought that the magnificent winged horse, Pegesus, was (from a practical point of view) a truly ridiculous creature.I mean, if you really had such an animal, with a set of massive wings that this creature had, it would be impossible to ride on his back without being repeatedly hit by the fierce beating of its incredible wing strokes. Nope. There's no way on Earth that any rider could remain on Pegesus' back for very long.You know, the reality is that that grossly overblown tale about grossly overblown egos fighting grossly overblown battles against grossly overblown monsters really isn't worth taking the time (as I'm taking here) to actually write a review about it. It really isn't.And, so, with that, I shall now close this frustrated review with this final and fitting statement - I thought that actor Sam Worthington made for a really terrible and easily-forgettable Perseus. He was nothing but a drab and dreary little wallflower of a demigod whose run-of-the-mill performance (which was on par with everyone else's) was of no consequence, whatsoever.",Wrath of the Titans
42,JoeB131,Actually a better film than the original...,4,25 July 2012,"but that's a ""leper with the most fingers"" kind of praise.So we pick up with Perseus left off, where his apparently immortal girlfriend died of ""not wanting to be in the stupid sequel"" disease. Meanwhile, he does hook up with the princess he had absolutely no interest in during the first movie, so there's that. (I really thought this was the biggest problem with the first film, if the hero doesn't care if the princess gets eaten by the monster, why should we?) So the Gods have been betrayed and Kronos is about about escape from Taterus, and that would generally be a bad thing. And we get long sequences of CGI goodness with Liam what's his name calling it in. And it's usually a bad sign for your movie when you are checking your watch wondering how long the CGI sequence you don't care about is going to continue.",Wrath of the Titans
43,robfollower,Wrath of the Titans(2012),9,12 September 2020,"""Wrath of the Titans"" is a step up from its predecessor ""Clash of the Titans"" in just about every way. It's also the best of what's become a slew of sword and sandal epics recently including Tarsem Singh's incomprehensible ""Immortals"" which shares some of the same characters as Wrath of the Titans. This film's saving grace is the story's simplicity. Make no mistake, this is a special effects movie and if there's one thing that screws up a special effects movie its a labyrinthian plot. Wrath of the Titans story is straight forward and easy to comprehend even if you don't don't know the difference between a god and a titan.It's 10 years since Perseus (Sam Worthington), the demigod son of Zeus, slayed the Krakken and he's been frittering away his life catching fish and taking the kid to school. One evening his father (Zeus, played by Liam Nesson) pays him a call with a dire tale to tell. The gods - who depend on human prayers to sustain them - are losing their grip. People have lost faith and are abandoning the temples in droves. This by itself is not such a bad thing but, as Zeus tells Perseus, the withering of the gods means they no longer have sufficient power to contain the titans, long imprisoned in Mount Tartarus. Said titans, now with a substantial bi.t.c.h. to pitch are beginning to escape and soon Kronos himself may find a way out. That would not be good. Kronos is the father of the gods and not someone to be trifled with. This isn't the place to go into his whole backstory but if you're not familiar with him, well, let's just say that he and his spawn (including Poseidon, Hades and Zeus) don't have a loving history. Zeus needs all the help he can get to try and stop the titans from taking over and destroying the world.Zeus' pleas to Perseus fall on deaf ears and so he goes to the underworld to try and recruit his wayward brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to the cause. Hades, with the help of Aries (Edgar Ramirez) captures Zeus and offers his power to Kronos in exchange for Kronos' word that, once free, he won't attempt to strip them of their immortality. In the meantime all hell is breaking lose (literally) on the surface and the reluctant Perseus finds he has no choice but to dust off his Krakken-slaying self and join the fray. He needs to find his way into Tartarus itself to free Zeus if he's to have any chance of stopping Kronos and Co. The second hour of the movie plays out this scenario and culminates in Perseus' big showdown with a rampaging Kronos.Wrath of the Titans is pretty much what I expect (and want) to see in a special effects blockbuster. It's strong in all the right places (mind-bending creatures, spectacular environments, lively pace) and weak where I pretty much expect a movie like this to be weak; namely dialogue. As I said earlier the story doesn't get needlessly bogged down in minutia and useless dead end plot lines ala the second and third ""Transformers"" films and, unlike Michael Bay, ""Wrath"" director Jonathan Liebsman doesn't hate women. There are no obvious reasons to tune the movie out and lots of reasons to tune in. It's fun, well executed, spectacular to behold in parts, easy to understand and doesn't take itself too seriously. Also, Kronos is one baaaad dude and watching him emerge from Tartarus and run roughshod o'er the landscape was worth the price of admission all by itself.",Wrath of the Titans
44,XweAponX,"Tougher, Grittier, than CLASH",10,26 September 2012,"The Gods are all missing, or dying. Years have passed since Perseus lopped off Medusa's head and used it to kill The Kraken. Io is gone, finally released from her tortuous never-ending existence, and now Zeus has a Grandson, Helius (John Bell), whom Zeus Visits while asleep.This is a dirtier, grittier, Greece compared to what we saw in Clash of The Titans. The Gods are not sparkling like they did in that film. All of the Gods are gone except for Zeus, Neptune, Hades and Ares-And Hades wants to wake up Cronus, in order to get a few more years of ""immortality.""And so Zeus once more asks Perseus to help him. But Perseus still won't have much to do with his forlorn Father. Sam Worthington reprises his role of Perseus and tackles it much the same as in ""Clash.""This is a Zeus who has lost everything, all he has left is Perseus. In a last ditch attempt on patching things up, Zeus and Neptune (Danny Houston) along with Ares (Edgar Ramírez) visit Hades (Ralph Fiennes) in Tartarus- Where Hades promptly injures Neptune and Kidnaps and Enslaves Zeus.It is only after two-headed devil dogs from Hell attack Perseus' Village and endanger his son that he decides to take Ol' Pegasus up to the mountain where Gods are Worshipped, but he's too late. Neptune shows up, gives him his Trident and a name: Agenor (Toby Kebbel) who is his son and has to be found in order to find Hephaestus (Bill Nighy).But Agenor is in Andromedas' jail. Andromeda has magically changed from Alexa Davalos to Rosamund Pike, but I could give two poops about that, both were good in the role. In fact, Andromeda has her whole army out in front of the mountain where Tartarus is. She elects to go with Perseus and Agenor to find the Missing God.What ensues is almost the Spaghetti-Western version of a Greek God story, and there are some very cool things, Cyclopses, Minotaurs, even the great Labyrinth into Tartarus Itself. The Titan Cronus is lodged into the side of a mountain, draining Zeus' power in order to get loose so he can destroy the world.This film, not being ""pretty"" like Clash was, depends more on the 'Fathers and Sons' meat of the tale, Perseus is a son of Zeus, who has a son Helius, Agenor is son of Neptune, and Ares is Perseus' Brother. The Journey to Tartarus and the Battle with Cronus is a family affair for Perseus, and he must needs ride Pegasus once more into the gaping maw of potential death.And as this movie showed a world that was mostly collapsing dirt, volcanoes, and gods turning into Dust, the CGI aspects were rendered that way. What surprised me is how much I liked this compared to the first one, which I did like a lot. But as that movie was akin to a far away fantasy, this movie shows how it would look if Titans and Gods indeed battled on the face of the Earth.Most satisfying was the interactions between Liam Neeson (Zeus) and Ray Fiennes (Hades) - A relationship so much like our relationships with our own brothers.As this film had basically a ""crash and burn"" ending, I suppose there will be no more movies in this Milieu. So I say Farewell to this short Franchise, it lived well, and it died well.",Wrath of the Titans

I thought maybe he was under contract to do a sequel if ""Clash"" did well enough? As it is Worthington is soulless & wooden as ""Persues"" & i thought in the first film he was fairly wooden but was fine because he was just playing an angry scowling warrior & didn't need to really act but here he's boring & extremely dull to watch & i can see why he faded as quickly as he became ""Big"" or ""Hot property""
Anyway it's lost any magic or sense of Adventure & fun fantasy from the excellent first film, this ""Wrath"" is abit darker i suppose but very dull because of it & there's weird trying to be funny characters here & there & it's a weird tone that never really works, feels too forced from everyone on screen.
There's lots of c.g.i fx & a few creatures but all done very unexciting & just put in boring sequences & there's no excitement or tense scenes just dull really.

47,3xHCCH,Way Better Than the First One,6,15 April 2012,"At first, I did not really have any plan of watching this movie since the first film in its series, ""Clash of the Titans,"" was so dismal. However today, since we were in the mall and my wife and daughter needed to get some shopping done, I brought my two sons to watch this. Hey, it was not as bad as I was expecting!This film follows the story of Perseus 10 years after he killed the Kraken. He is a poor fisherman in a small town, a single dad with a son. When his dad Zeus was taken hostage by Hades and Ares in order to restore the powers and release the Titan Kronos (father of Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) from Tartarus, Perseus reunites with Andromeda (now queen) to embark on a rescue mission. Maybe because the director thought we all know how this will end, he throws us a preposterous surprise at the end.On the debit side, their Greek mythology is mixed-up! What is the Minotaur doing in the Tartarus maze? It's like the writer was also inspired by the revisionist mythology by the Percy Jackson books instead of classical mythology. The supposedly immortal gods can even DIE here! The acting is not that important here. Sam Worthington is still a bland lead actor. Rosamund Pike does not convince as a warrior queen. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes (as Zeus and Hades respectively) were rather cheesy, as they appeared and acted more human than godly really. Overall though, this film is okay on the level of a CG action adventure. The visual effects are breath- taking, especially how they fiery way they envisioned Kronos! The creatures that battled Perseus and company during his quest, as well as the labyrinthine structure of Tartarus, are excellently executed.

Subsequently, the bulk of its mistakes have not been corrected here, in fact some of them have gotten worse. If Clash of the Titans seemed dumb, you might find the sheer absurdity of this sequel, with its hokey applications of Greek mythology, to be almost unholy. Worthington was one of the worst things about Clash of the Titans. Arguably one of the most lifeless performances of that year, he has since grown a bit as an actor (a bit). For his second time as Perseus, there seems to be a little bit more merit in him, although the character remains pretty paper thin. Once again, Perseus has little to do but run, ride Pegasus and fight. I have a feeling that we see more of Worthington's stunt man in the movie than we do of Worthington himself. Director Jonahan Liebesman keeps the audience in their seat by ramping up the spectacle, and to some degree, his efforts are impressive. There are times when Wrath of the Titans looks as daunting and mesmerizing as anything in the fantasy genre, but unfortunately it's also very noisy. After an expository first fifteen minutes, Wrath of the Titans turns into an over rushed parade of loud action sequences, accompanied by titanic clouds of dust, painfully cheesy dialogue (with lines like ""let's have some fun"") and confused character motivation.Yes, there will be people out there who will be entertained by the relentlessness of Wrath of the Titans, but it was too much noise for me.",Wrath of the Titans
50,jadepietro,Wrath of the Moviegoer,3,6 April 2012,"This film is not recommended.The Kraken has been released and is now dead and gone! But there are still other monsters afoot in this flat-footed tale called Wrath of the Titans. Loosely based on Greek mythology, Wrath of the Titans again has those irate gods and evil demons creating havoc upon us mere mortals. To call this film a Greek tragedy would a breach of honesty, giving over to the misconception that this odyssey is an important and stirring drama of epic proportions. But it truly is a tragedy, in the sense that it wastes the talents of all the actors and filmmakers involved in this project. One can however say, in all honesty, that this film does fill one with awe, in the sense that it is awful, and that is certainly a more accurate assessment of this movie fantasy.In this worthless sequel to the unworthy Clash of the Titans, Perseus ( Sam Worthington ), son of Zeus ( Liam Neeson ) and a mortal mom, is now a peaceful fisherman and loving father. He is called to duty to protect his godly dad from his sinister Uncle Hades ( Ralph Fiennes ) and Zeus' other son, Ares ( Edgar Ramirez ) who want to take over his kingdom and throne. Revenge and jealousy runs rampant up this genealogical family tree.That's the basic plot with plenty of action sequences, middling special effects, and other slight of hand tricks at work. The script by committee is mediocre and dull, lacking any excitement, energy or wit. The dialog is just plain dumb. Any moviegoers' wrath should be aimed directly at the film's writers: Dan Mazeau, David Johnson, and Greg Berlanti. ( One howling example of bad dialogue: Hades says to Zeus: ""You look 10,000 years younger!"" )The direction by Jonathan Liebesman is nearly non-existent as his film plods from one set piece to the next with no real pacing or rhythm. The editing is clumsy and pieced together at such a frenzied rate that it is sometimes impossible to really see the action or special effects properly. Battle scenes are awkwardly photographed and staged. The photography is dimly lit by Ben Davis with some scenes just plain ugly and seemingly out of focus, shocking inept, especially coming from a major motion picture studio and their larger budget. ( Beware the Gods, Warner Brothers! ). None of the actors, who have all done better work elsewhere, are believable or credible in their roles, but they are all laughable in their grim serious tones and hammy theatrics. Worthington, usually a charismatic actor, is puffy and bland this time around, Neeson and Fiennes pontificate rather than speak and delivery their lines without any true sense of passion, and Ramirez looks pouty more than angry. He also talks sporadically with a thick Spanish accent that clashes with the mostly British cast, and he's not Titan either. Also on hand in this version are: Rosamund Pike as Andromeda who fills her battle armor well, Bill Nighy as a crazed Hephaestus who seems to have walked into the movie thinking he was part of a Monty Python remake, and Toby Kebbell as Agenor, son of Posideon and, perhaps, the illegitimate child of Russell Brand. So, I guess, on that issue of acting, it may have been a more difficult feat of acting given their one-dimensional characters and their hysterics. At least, they manage to keep a straight face in all this goofiness. But on second thought, the outtakes may have been more enjoyable. A fantasy film that relies heavily on its CGI needs to make sure its creatures and make-up are top-notch if the audience is going to believe in its cinematic power. The effects here are of the hit-and-miss variety ( the good: the Chimera, the Cyclops, and the maze-like walls of Hades; the bad: Pegasus, the Minotaur, and practically everything else, especially Kronos the Lava Man ).I know what you're thinking...It's only a kiddie fantasy adventure movie. Give it some slack! No, I can't! I will continue to fight the Battle of Banality that is being served as entertainment nowadays. My quest to rid the world of dreck like this is an on-going battle lately. ( Remember I was served heaping helpings of John Carter and Mirror, Mirror in these past weeks! What a dismal start to this movie season so far. ) Wrath of the Titans is an absolute waste of your time and hard-earned money. Avoid it like the Kraken! As the movie tagline states or warns us: ""Feel the Wrath!"" Oh, on that you can be sure! How true, oh Great Zeus, how true!

51,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Wrath of the Titans (2012),5,10 June 2012,"I really wanted to love this film. After getting the remake out of the way, this had the chance to really explore new areas of this mythological world. Instead, they just decided to make a big monster mash with once again little character development. Perseus has lived a quiet life for 10 years, but must now travel to the underworld to save his father, otherwise Cronos and other Titans are going to destroy gods and man. He must meet people, collect specific items, travel through mazes, and of course battle monsters. The monsters are great. They really look fantastic, and all are consistent as opposed to the last film. The cyclops looked amazing, and made me crave more films about giants instantly. The films repetitive pacing soon wears thin, and I wished I had been playing a computer game with these graphics and creatures. The script does try hard in places, mostly with the relationship between Hades and Zeus. But when you hear the terrible attempts at comedy from Kebbell and Nighy, it's clear the film wanted a broader audience. May as well stick it on in the background and pay attention every time it gets loud.",Wrath of the Titans
52,rgkarim,Should you see the Wrath,6,30 March 2012,"Hard to believe that two years ago we were watching Sam Worthington Playing the role of Perseus and attempting to stop the gods' tyranny over the human world in Clash of the Titans. That movie was mediocre at best, but had some decent mythological adventure that got many people back into the Greek culture. So when I saw a sequel coming out I thought, ""Hey Wrath of the Titans looks like it will make up for what its predecessor lacked."" Today I gave Wrath of the Titans a try and well it's pretty much like the first one with a few improvements. Read on to find out more about this sequel.The premise of this story is quite ironic to me, as instead of trying to destroy the Gods Perseus is instead trying to help them from obliteration. A lack of praying by the humans has left the Gods weak and as a result their imprisonment of the Titan Kronos is slowly fading. Perseus is thus charged with the task of finding a way to stop this from happening, even if it means venturing to the underworld itself. I know the quest sounds promising and combined with the trailers, I was thinking this adventure was going to be full of fast paced action that the other one lacked. The good news is the directors managed to improve a bit of the action, a few of the scenes through the quest were actually well planned, coordinated, and full of Greek against monster action. I'm happy to say that the ending battles delivered the action I was looking for, with many of the human vs. Titan minions mimicking Lord of The Rings style action. Most of the scenes were even well captured, the camera work for once not being too jumpy to avoid showing off the detailed battle. Unfortunately, the planners decided to once again insert a massacre scene where a good portion of the party gets whacked in a matter of seconds; though I will say this scene was much better than the Medusa hunting scene in the previous movie. Now I've mentioned a lot of monsters, creatures, and fighting scenes so far in this review and you may be asking, ""Hey Robbie, how was the CGI surrounding the action?"" The answer to that question is pretty good, as the designing team managed to make the various Greek monsters come to life in terrifying ways. Environments and battlefields were well detailed from the gritty dusty plains, to the dark filled caves of the underworld, and were not the polished, clean, artificial worlds that we've seen in countless Star Wars films. The editing with the CGI was also well done and flowed smoothly with little if any choppy animated movements, with the extras also interacting well with the artificial environment. Perhaps it's here I will mention that the musical score was excellent. Every scene in this movie had the right touch of music to help spur the emotion and pull you further into the scene. Albeit it sounds like all the other orchestra works in countless movies, I was still impressed by how well the score and scenes went together. As for characters/acting purposes, well there really isn't that much of a change from the prequel. Worthington plays the exact same role as the first film, and essentially performs the same way he did two years ago, with the exception of he has more action this time. Liam Neeson still knows how to play Zeus, and has that same monotone, deep, smooth voiced delivery of his lines that has made him famous in countless movies. The leading lady for this movie is not Io, but instead Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) who has a little more fight to her despite the fact that most of the emotion and lines are delivered in the same manner. However, I think the best characters for me in this movie were Agenor (Toby Kebbell) and Hephaestus (Bill Nighy). Both of these characters brought comedic relief to the movie, yet still had other qualities about them that separated them from the typical fool sidekick. Kebbell is kind of like the Russell Brand in this movie, except not drunk, while Nighy had more of the eccentric and crazy humor at his disposal. I do admit there were a few times in his dialog where he brought back his Davy Jones accent, which had me laughing. Other than the rest of the cast was fine, but nothing to really brag about other than maybe Ralph Fiennes who showed off his ability to be dark, gloomy, and cunning, and this time without the cheesy scream.Overall Wrath of the Titans was an improvement over its predecessor, but it's still nothing to brag about. While the action was better, it still didn't live up to what I had gotten from the trailer, at least not until the end. The simple plot was also very predictable and linear, with not too many surprises happening along the way. I also felt that the trailer had set up a lot of other mythological legends, but when it came time to deliver them well they weren't that exciting to experience. So my scores for this movie are the following:Action/Adventure: 7.0 -7.5 Movie overall: 6.5I would say this movie is worth a Netflix or rent, and definitely not worth a 3-D ticket price. However, I would say that fans of Greek mythology will probably not be disappointed with the latest Titans installment. Check back soon for my review on Mirror Mirror and as always keep enjoying the movies.",Wrath of the Titans
53,p-stepien,"Louder, bigger, more ludicrous",4,19 February 2013,"Living the life in his self-proclaimed heroic retirement Persues (Sam Worthington) now leads the life of a simple fisherman, singlehandedly caring for his son Helius (John Bell) after the death of his wife. Despite a yearning for peace and quiet godly affairs still meddle into the lives of men. This time with potentially tragic consequences, when Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares (Édgar Ramírez) aide the titanic almighty fiery Kronos from him hellish prison. To do this they capture Zeus (Liam Neeson) to draw his life-force. With dark forces already invading the surface Perseus is forced to once again take up his armour and attempt to rescue his father, accompanied by only a handful of comrades, including Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) and the goofish son of Poseidon, Agenor (Toby Kebbell).Now detaching itself almost entirely from ancient lore, we are thrown into an epic waste of a budget into a charmless and nonsensical venture thrown the depths of Hades, featuring minotaurs, labyrinths, cyclops and other mythical creatures. Whereas the action itself brings about some inkling of satisfaction, the build-up and plot borders of humiliating. As Perseus takes on the remnants of gods (not many have been left, as most other gods have been disposed of off-screen under unknown circumstances) the significance of his journey is ever in doubt, not helped by some twisting incoherence of certain key characters with some ill-advised Shakespearesque betrayals and dramatic twists. It is somewhat cringe-worthy watching two great actors Fiennes and Nesson exchanging sentimental gibberish and donning ridiculous expressions to an attempt to convey sincerity, but they do a passable job nonetheless. It must be said that Sam Worthington gets passing grades, arguably the most convincing actor out there, but only truly hitting home when in good acting company. The worst offender here is Tony Kebbell, whose utterly useless kooky fool character is at best a tiresome distraction, at worst an outtake character from the Hercules series.",Wrath of the Titans
54,lewiskendell,A better effort on the second try.,7,1 October 2012,"I was thoroughly disappointed with the Clash of the Titans remake. It was a dull, uninteresting slog of endlessly plodding action scenes and tons of unmemorable CG effects being thrown at the viewer from every angle as a poor substitute for excitement.Thankfully, Wrath of the Titans manages to be a better movie than Clash in nearly every area. The story is basic but serviceable, with the father of the gods threatening to escape his prison and take out his vengeance on the earth. The gods themselves, weakened by lack of worship and divided by old conflicts, are powerless to face the danger. It falls to Perseus (Sam Worthington) and a small band or warriors to set things right. The major improvement Wrath makes is that the action scenes and set pieces are much more exciting this time around. Whether chimera attack or the shifting, crushing walls of a labyrinth and the dangerous beast inside, I was never bored by what was happening on the screen. At the very least, this is a watchable fantasy action flick, which puts it above the first film. Greek mythology is so rich and dense that so much more could be done with the gods, monster and locales that Wrath of the Titans mines for material. Even as flawed as Immortals was, it certainly wasn't generic, which even this improved sequel doesn't totally escape until near the end. Still, whether you enjoyed or loathe the Clash of the Titans reboot, this one is better.",Wrath of the Titans
55,moviexclusive,"A marked improvement from its predecessor, this sequel offers thrilling action sequences but is still let down by a thin plot and weak characters",6,28 March 2012,"The Gods indeed deserved better than the 2010 remake of 'Clash of the Titans', a wholly ill-conceived attempt at revisiting the campy Ray Harryhausen sword-and-sorcery epic that instead replaced the original's stop-motion visual effects with second-rate CG effects. And certainly, the producers seemed to have heeded the call with this sequel, retaining the fine cast from the original- Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes- while opting for fresh writers and a new director.It's still as important however to keep your hopes down for 'Wrath of the Titans', especially for those expecting a sweeping mythological epic. Taking over the reins from French director Louis Leterrier is Johnathan Liebesman, and going by his previous works- 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"" and ""Battle: Los Angeles""- the man is at best an efficient but uninspired director who pays more attention to visceral pleasures than to anything resembling depth.That is certainly true of his work here, which vastly improves the action sequences of the original but little else. As if singularly devoting his time to create mind-numbing big-budget sequences, Liebesman invests little in the story and in his characters- God, demi-god and human alike. Both are mechanical at best and engineered with a specific purpose of taking his viewer from one jaw-dropping sequence to another, never mind the inconsistencies or the leaps of logic along the way.So despite the exposition, the plot of the entire movie can be summed up in a one line- to save Zeus (Neeson) from his conniving brother Hades (Fiennes) and jealous son Aroes (Edgar Ramirez), the demi-god Perseus (Worthington) leaps back into full battle mode since retiring ten years ago to a quiet life in a small fishing village. Before facing the worst of them all, Perseus will have to go up against a host of hideous- looking monsters- a fiery-mouthed Chimera with two heads at the front and a snake's head at its tail; a trio of towering Cyclops giants; a Minotaur; and a band of half-man, half-rock soldiers with four arms and two bodies that twist around on a pair of legs.There's no denying that the creatures this time are much more inventive, and the action sequences choreographed much more skilfully, adding up to a much more thrilling time than what its predecessor offered. Saving the best for last, Liebesman also crafts an epic finale with a gigantic lava-spewing monster known as the Kronos that also involves a whole legion led by warrior-queen Princess Andromeda (Rosamund Pike). The victory call at the end may be a tad overdone, but the climax alone is worth the price of admission and surprisingly impressive even in post- converted 3D.Pity then that the rest of the movie often pales in comparison- and perhaps the most jarring of all is the poorly defined interfamilial conflict between Zeus, Hades and Aroes. Screenwriters Dan Mazeau and David Leslie Johnson (working off a story that's also credited to Greg Berlanti) give Aroes little motivation behind his father's betrayal other than his envy of Perseus, nor do they manage the sibling tension between Zeus and Hades convincingly. Worse still, they try to turn Hades into a less straightforward character by casting him as a reluctant pawn in Aroes' scheme midway into the movie, and the subsequent reconciliation between Zeus and Hades is laughable even with the considerable acting talents of Neeson and Fiennes.Certainly, both thespians are well aware of the thin material here, but kudos to the pair for trying to imbue their Godly characters with the gravitas they usually bring to their roles. Among the more interesting additions to the cast are Bill Nighy as the loony weapons-maker Hephaestus whom Perseus approaches for help to gain entry to the underworld labyrinth Zeus is held captive, as well as Toby Kebbell as Poseidon's son Agenor and the only other character besides Hephaestus to have a sense of humour in the entire movie.Indeed, the movie takes itself too seriously for its own good, ignoring its own campy origins in favour of a self-serious sensibility to its storytelling that only further exposes its plot and character flaws. This is, and perhaps has always been, about watching Gods, demi-gods and monsters go at each other with sound and fury- and thankfully, this sequel easily betters its predecessor on this regard alone. That's not likely to be enough to make the Gods happy though, but for those of us mortals looking for big-budget mind-numbing spectacle, this will do just fine. www.moviexclusive.com",Wrath of the Titans
56,saadgkhan,Wrath of the Headches,4,16 April 2012,"Wrath of the Titans – CATCH IT (C+) Wrath of the Titans is all about action, action and action. Sadly in action movies its interesting only if the cause of the action makes some sense. In this movie Hades captures Zeus with help of his son Ares, and now its Perseus responsibility to save his father and humanity. The story is really thin and especially when Hades even doesn't want to kill Zeus so I don't understand why he cannot order his underworld's Titans to just stop it? Anyway its useless to use your brain in this movie, simply watch the movie and get headaches in 3D.Sam Worthington is boring compare to the first part, Rosamund Pike is alright, she has not been able to touch stardom since her high profile Bond girl role on Die Another Day 007. Tobey Kebbell is funny but I don't find him very talented. Bill Nighy, Edgar Ramirez, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes were fine, there was nothing they could have done with mediocre script.Overall, it's a time pass forgettable movie, and who thought Clash of the Titans was bad will think again.",Wrath of the Titans
57,MR_Heraclius,Not bad,6,15 February 2020,"I personally felt that the sequel to the remake of Clash of the Titans was much better movie than the remake itself. What made this film work more than the 2010 film was that it a better story, better performances and overall a bit more engaging action. The remake was a mess because the action was all over the place, and you simply lost interest after a while. With Wrath of Titans, they seemed to take a step back, and focus more on a writing a better story, with effective action that would please fantasy fans. The film is far from perfect, but overall it's a satisfying movie that might surprise viewers that hated the Clash of the Titans remake. The run time is shorter, thus it gets to the point fairly quickly and in the case of this film, it's a big plus because, the original just tried too hard at being grand, ambitious and epic, and in turn it turned out to be a tiresome mess of a film, one that wasn't worth investing your time in, and it showed plenty of weak points instead of strengths because it copied the 80's original, instead of trying to come up with a new angle to tell the story. The filmmakers have succeeded at crafting an entertaining movie with lots of action that is not boring or dull, and it's got a good story as well, maybe not the best, but far better than its predecessor. This is not great cinema, but it's a fun, entertaining popcorn action fantasy film if you're in the right frame of mind to watch. The film won't get any awards, but it's not bad either. I was very much entertained by this follow-up, and considering it follows-up a remake, they managed to make it better than its predecessor.",Wrath of the Titans
58,Troy_Campbell,Fails to deliver.,4,30 March 2012,"Although Clash of the Titans was universally dismissed as an overwhelming disappointment – and featured the worst post-converted 3D ever – it raked in the big bucks and a sequel was naturally green-lit by Warner Bros. With a new director (Battle LA's Jonathan Liebesman replacing Louis Leterrier) and an extra $25m to toy with, Wrath was given the opportunity to learn from its predecessor's mistakes. Alas, this loud and sporadically entertaining mess largely fails to deliver; Sam Worthington's acting again doesn't cut the mustard, the action is well-choreographed but repetitive, and the CGI remains below par considering the dosh thrown at it. However, it's the lack of imagination and unpredictability in the plot department that truly stifles the proceedings. If you get to the end of the first act and don't already know how the rest of the movie is going to play out, you're probably sleeping. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes spice things up as Zeus and Hades respectively, and Toby Kebbell's comic sidekick is a successful ploy to inject the humour sorely missing from Clash, but it's not enough to make this misfire recommendable.",Wrath of the Titans

Following the events of the first movie, Perseus wants to live the quiet & carefree life of a fisherman along with his son. However, Zeus warns him that his brother Hades(Ralph Fiennes), wants to unleash the ancient Titans upon the world. After Zeus is dragged into the underworld by Hades & a traitor it's Perseus' job to save his father & stop the terror of the treacherous Titans. This is the summary of the movie.A note on the story & the 3D effects. A humongous improvement for the better from Clash of the Titans(2010). You can actually feel the 3D in this one when all the mythical creatures(Cyclops & the likes) come menacingly close to you. The first one though was poorly converted to the 3D format. It was 3D just for the sake of being 3D. Not the case with this one though. Kudos! A note on the performances. Sam Worthington is impressive as Perseus. Liam Neeson & Ralph Fiennes are both brilliant as Zeus & Hades respectively. Edgar Ramirez is menacingly good as Ares. Toby Kebbell as Agenor, Rosamund Pike as Andromeda & Bill Nighy as Hephaestus are effective as well. So, I would like to conclude by saying Wrath of the Titans is worth your time & money.

61,fernandoschiavi,"As in the previous film from 2010, the script is shallow and full of flaws. Uma resounding disappointment",5,8 November 2020,"And is not that the sequel to Clash of the Titans was even released? The only explanation for a sequel to a film's success at the box office where producers seek to raise more money with a story that attracted an audience before and may well attract the same people and many others, or when the studio and producers have legitimate aim of correcting errors grotesque and give a new focus to the plot. Wrath of the Titans seems to have gone out paper with the two goals, but only managed to reach the first mentioned.Louis Leterrier, director's previous film, back only as executive producer, and makes room for the arrival of South African Jonathan Liebesman (the good The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-The Beginning (2006) and Darkness Falls (2003)). Liebesman can print this style more visceral and raw to long. Yet the most curious is that Leterrier became famous just for scoring this visual aspect dirtier and realistic in his acclaimed work The Incredible Hulk, who managed to get away from the more fanciful version of Hulk director Ang Lee, 2003.Liebesman, as already said, can the goal of visual long, but your choice confirms the choice made by Warner. Instead of correcting the previous film, exploring the most and with the highest possible fidelity, the vast Greek mythology and the fascination she causes us to today, to develop a web of epic action with numerous battles, interesting monsters and spectacular effects.The director films the action scenes in close-ups, with the camera always moving - he had already used in virtually every scene of the World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles - and cuts super-fast and in random directions, the best style scenes of Michael Bay in his films, especially the films of the series ""Transformers."" It is also clear that Liebesman is lost in space in the back for chroma-key despite having had a previous experience with the technique, damaging several sequences in the film as a simple fight scene between four people, the warriors clash with Cyclops ( that after many minutes we realized that, in fact, were two Cyclops), in the fight with the Minotaur (where we realized that this was the Minotaur after it is dropped) and the final confrontation with Kronos, where notions of distance, perspective and proportionality are simply ignored. In a few moments plan sequence (when Perseus attacks chimera or when Makhai encroaching on human army), we can better follow the action on stage without getting bewildered by the excessive changes in plans of filming.But the big problem, as in the previous film, 2010, the script is shallow and full of flaws. Uma resounding disappointment, since one of them is David Leslie Johnson, the good thriller Orphan (2009) and some episodes of the series TV worldwide hit The Walking Dead). Dan Mazeau now makes its debut in the script on this adventure. Following the same style as the previous script is an absolute lack of personality. Your biggest problem is to underestimate the viewer wondering just be young people who are looking for action scenes, and being full of phrases and passages self-explanatory. At one point, Ares (Edgar Ramirez) says ""Tartarus, the underworld of the big prison"" at the exact moment when the characters arrive to the location (as if they did not know where they were going). Another example is the conversation between Perseus and a lady who takes care of their injuries or when Hades tells Zeus: ""My brother who banned me so I take care of my father now wants reconciliation."" Or worse: at the beginning of the movie when the Chimera breathes fire on all sides, Perseus says something like: ""Caution! She eaters! "".In addition, there are the famous holes and unexplained situations. At various points of the film, the characters speak different Perseus things like ""You must travel to the underworld"", ""You are the last hope of mankind"" and ""And do not forget, the hand holding the spear should be your"" giving to understand that he can only and exclusively face the Titans. What the writers seem to forget is the reason for this. At another point, a character says that Hephaestus should get closer to the sky. The reason once again we did not know. What about Perseus flying through the lava or Cyclops appearing out of nowhere and attacking without reason. The only apparent reason is cause stunning scenes of action on the screen in both cases cited. Not to mention the fact that the characters constantly act as if everything they witness that universe full of creatures and monsters were the absolute novelty - as when Perseus, who after facing Medusa, the Kraken, giant scorpions and chimeras two heads, is incredulous when he meets a cyclops giant in the forest, with the sole purpose of trying to further magnify the scene and cause a greater expectation and fear in the audience.Other failures can be better perceived in the synopsis and motivations. Liebesman and writers do not bother to make any presentation or contextualization of history. With a few minutes of the film are already played the on-screen action scene. Another basic flaw is: Why, if the gods are fading because people do not pray anymore, why not Perseus convinces to pray?Instead of being further explored, we again see very few gods, who are represented by the brothers again original and Ares. The rest of Olympus is absent in the plot. Another inexplicable mistake is to show that weakened Zeus and Hades needs prayers even less popular remains strong. Already Ares, with all hands immortality, can afford to feel jealous brother's half-human being that his father had had numerous other children. But that is not the worst. Is never explained the real reason that led Ares betray his father or even justifying the actions of Hades. What about a titan who fought for over ten years before being imprisoned and is easily defeated by a demigod mounted on a winged horse immune larvae issued by Titan recently released.Clash of the Titans 2, despite being a sideshow in effect, proves very deficient in the edition of Martin Walsh. We see a show scenes disjointed and not behave so as to fit the loose ends of the plot. The scene is an example of the maze, with plans that do not complement each other in a logical order. And waves of Chimera? When she attacks everyone at the beginning of the film, we see clearly the son of Perseus being burned by the creature and then in the next scene we seem crazy and imagine everything. It is a glaring error. How Perseus and his partners left the enterprise Tártato supposedly a place impossible to enter and exit? After releasing Zeus, the protagonists just are already in the army camp. A spark caused an effect on the sword that ""teleported"" to the camp. Until now seek an explanation for the escape magic spot.The new script and Sam Worthington character at least bother to present Perseus a hero more sympathetic, and finally give hair consistent with the time and do not show all the hair shaved of yore. Fatherhood did well to the protagonist, with one goal, to protect someone, with this having a better understanding of Zeus. Danny Huston and Liam Neeson are fine as ever, even with the first having a short appearance. Ralph Fiennes also can prove more powerful and less submissive, even with the crisis of sudden awareness of his character seeking the forgiveness of sins. Edgar Ramirez as Ares, strives to bring out the character in god of war, but not enough time in aempolgar algum. Bill Night (barely tapped) and Toby Kebbell be borne by the scenes of humor, a la Jack Sparrow, but Most scenes are dull and do not take spontaneous laughter from the audience.Already Rosamund Pike is just replacing Gemma Arterton as the pretty face of production (but is still far less beautiful than Gemma) because her character is poorly built, lost and ridiculous actions. The Queen Andromeda abandons his troops as to follow Perseus. Despite seeing an evolution in character than before princess became a queen strong ahead of the battlefield, this change is forced and she is very badly exploited as a warrior. But even worse is the forced relationship with Perseus, especially in the scene where he steals a kiss from her. It seems that the writers tried to fix the error in the previous movie did not follow the legend, trying to finally join the famous mythological couple. Interesting is to see are beautiful hair and clean skin in full battlefield. Many women wonder what the secret of the queen.One of the big attractions of Wrath of the Titans are the monsters and fantastic creatures. This time we see the chimera, minotaur, cyclops and titan Cronus himself. The special effects are what save and elevate the movie to an acceptable level in the category Entertainment. The construction of the bizarre and interesting characters is realistic and menacing, especially those involving the creation of Cronus and his attacks, extremely realistic and menacing. Their slow movements merging with acute attacks of places and show his power and majesty before others. The 3D, unlike the fiasco rushed from the previous film, works great if using debris and particles to try to immerse the viewer in the scene.Wrath of the Titans lacks credibility. It is clearly all an excuse for another quest for salvation of mankind.

However, the action is much superior than previously and the pacing is more trimmed making it more enjoyable, it's still not a good film by any means, it has hammy and poor dialogue but it is a lot more fun and better structured overall.4/10: An okay film that has nice action scenes",Wrath of the Titans

I felt like I could be a bit more forgiving of ""Wrath of the Titans"" because it was a sort of fresh start unlike the senseless retooling that was its predecessor.Thankfully, ""Wrath of the Titans"" did provide haters of the remake a jumping-on point to give this new tale of Perseus a chance. I choose to think of this movie as a sequel to the original 1981 movie. I know it seems ridiculous, but it's what I have to do to come to grips with this follow-up.""Wrath of the Titans"" Blu-ray is perfect for fans of Greek mythology and fantasy films. The movie itself is a step above the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake. It's full of action and the special effects are effective.",Wrath of the Titans

But what it has in visuals, it lacks in story. Wrath's first problem is that it isn't a Greek Mythology story. Another problem is the fact that it's a made up mythology story that isn't even necessarily a good one.Perseus(played again by Sam Worthington) is called back to action to save his father Zeus(Liam Neeson) from Hades and Aroes, who are going to give Zeus to Kronos, the big fire guy. So it's basically up to Perseus, Poseidon's son(played by Toby Kebbel) and Andromeda(played by Rosmund Pike) to save him.I liked the 2010 remake. It was almost the same as the 80's film, but with a vast improvement in visuals. But Wrath isn't anything special. It doesn't really follow mythology, and doesn't really serve a purpose. But it's not that bad. But could have been better.C+",Wrath of the Titans

Zeus also tells him the walls of Tartarus are crumbling and the imprisoned Kronos will soon be free, but valuing his family's safety, Perseus refuses to get involved. Zeus meets his brothers Hades & Poseidon, along with Ares, Posiedon's son, to find a way to rebuild Tartarus' walls, but instead is attacked by Hades. He and Ares make a deal with Kronos...drain Zeus's power in exchange for remaining immortal. When Perseus learns of this, he is sets out, along with Queen Andromeda, to stop Kronos before it's too late.Not many sequels better or surpass their prequel, but Wrath of the Titans is one film that does that, and does it well. Oh, and just to inform you...if you're expecting exact accuracy of Greek mythology then you'll be disappointed, but to be honest you're a bit gullible if you DO expect a Hollywood adaptation of Greek mythology to be exact. This is, after all, an Action/Fantasy film...not a Documentary.Reading some of the criticism this film's received is a bit bewildering with one saying ""lacks inspiration or zest in storytelling, performance or action"". Lacks action?! Really?! I must have seen a different film because there is action-a-plenty. Anyway, the film may lack real depth for a story, but with a movie like this, I can't really see how it can be a mutli-layered story. It's Greek mythology, not a film adaptation of War & Peace.The action is excellent and the special & visual effects are absolutely stunning, especially for Kronos, who, thankfully, had more screen time than the Kracken in Clash of the Titans. Some of the acting's a bit wooden but it's still a very enjoyable mythological romp that is FAR better than tripe like Legend of Hercules and John Carter.Ignore the critics on this one and judge for yourself.

68,billygoat1071,Lifeless Explosions,5,1 April 2012,"The 2010 version of Clash of the Titans replaces the magic from the original film to a more epic tone. It suppose to be cool but it spends most of the time explaining things and making some senseless drama. Wrath of the Titans tries to be bigger than the first film. It can be fun, but it gets boring when we go to the characters. The script didn't give any depth or life to them. Some performances saves it but it still feel lifeless. The action is exciting but we don't get much of it and it's pretty shaky in a clumsy way. Wrath of the Titans tends to improve the mistakes, but some of its flaws just got worse.Weak character development is one thing that troubles most in this series though it's an action film and nobody is here for the characters, but sometimes it kind of enervates the joys of fighting giant monsters and senseless explosions. The cast sort of improves the characters. Sam Worthington may not give his character a lot of personality but his physicality works best. But I still think he is a miscast as Perseus. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are predictably good. Bill Nighy is just delightful to watch.The action is pretty good but it gets boring when there's not. The film itself is totally lifeless. The action just brought some of it to life. The film still suffers with bad drama and subplots that are definitely unavoidable. The story doesn't make any sense though. The best is the CGI. It makes the movie big and exciting. Excessive explosions and flames is what all action movie lovers came here for. Unfortunately, not all the action were well played. Shaky camera is suppose to bring some momentum but it's too close and it doesn't have a decent shot. There are also pointless fight scenes especially the Minotaur. The monster looks good though. We get to see a lot of awesome giant monsters. The climax here is longer than the first movie. It's all fun but it ends up making no sense. This is usual in action films these days which is sad.I guess people are going to enjoy this for the action. Greek Mythology fans might find it interesting by the visuals and portrayal of the setting but the story and the script are weak. It could have been so much better but the awfulness of its flaws kind of ruined the enjoyment. It's not entirely bad but it's just unsatisfying and lifeless.

This may sound like something to go queue up and see, but it wasn't anywhere near good.Plans to make a sequel to Clash of the Titans has been around from the shooting of the first film. The producers were hoping to rake in enough cash from the movie and then use that as a good lead to shoot Wrath of the Titans. Although Clash of the Titans was a waste of film reel, it still made 3 times its production cost from the box office, and therefore Wrath was done.The only good thing in the movie was that, I did not fall asleep I give them that. The movie isn't that bad, it just wasn't worth making.Shooting was done mostly in Europe in areas of vast land so that the scenes of destruction would have room to be done. The movie had pointless chaos all due to the script and unwarranted emotions, displayed by the actors that will keep you wandering if the director was actually watching.The plot is as simple as what I said above, Perseus goes on rampage into the underworld to save his father Zeus and save the world from the hands of a mighty.and Ares the god of war.Planning to thrill the movie watches with stick like acting and scenes warranty you to wonder if the director was actually sleeping during shooting, is what Warner Bros tries to pass on as a movie, I shake my head in disapproval and disappointment.Directed by Jonathan Liebesman, a South African director who was responsible for the movie Battle: Los Angeles",Wrath of the Titans

73,kirk-246,You Love it or you Hate it. Simple as that.,7,30 March 2012,"All right, I agree with most people when they say 2010's Clash of the Titans was not a great movie, but I didn't hate it. I didn't walk out of the theater with a feeling like ""OMG, that movie kicked ass!"". It was OK, I thought the film had pacing issues and the 3D was, well... about as bad and pointless as people made it out to be. So is the sequel, Wrath of the Titans, an improvement?I'm happy to report that yes, Wrath of the Titans is better. It's not a great film by any means, it is flawed, but if you're looking for 99 simple minutes to kill by looking at some pretty darn impressive action sequences, then you are in luck. Also, if you thought the 3D in Clash was bad, that's not the case with Wrath. Don't expect anything along the lines of Avatar, but I gotta say, the 3D was used pretty nicely and didn't come off as a total gimmick.My biggest issue with the film, however, is one that I had with the previous film. The film sometimes feels a bit slow and that it takes a while to get started, and there's not really much investment in the story or the characters. Some of the characters are mostly there to provide comic relief, but even that is very hit-or-miss. For the most part, Sam Worthington played his role pretty good, a fine example of under-rated acting. It's nothing great, but it's far from abysmal. Liam Neeson was also rather enjoyable to watch, but hey, it's Liam Neeson. Everybody else isn't particularly interesting, but they're not unforgivably boring or useless. There's also a small romance in the film between Worthington and a female side character, but it comes off as pointless and un-needed. I just don't see why the majority of popcorn action flicks require a relationship when we go to see explosions and amazing special effects, it's just not necessary.Flaws aside, I enjoyed Wrath of the Titans. I am aware of the hate that this movie is receiving and I can understand some of the quibbles that one may have against it, but hey, at least it's better than it's predecessor.",Wrath of the Titans
74,nickmesafilms,Wrath of the Titans (2012) - 99 Minutes of Boredom!,5,5 July 2012,"Set as a sequel to the remake of ""Clash of the Titans"", which was really quite unnecessary, ""Wrath of the Titans"" continues the story of Perseus and his everlasting battle with the Titans. I honestly feel like there's no use into talking about the plot, because honestly, there is no plot to talk about it. But I will say that Liam Neeson's Zeus has been kidnapped by Ralph Fiennes' Hades, and now Sam Worthington's Perseus has to team up with an army to go rescue him. Oh God, I just said the plot! Now, during the first 20 minutes, I started to become impressed with this movie. The effects were cool to look at, and the story started at an interesting point. But afterward, the story just plummeted after those enjoyable first 20 minutes. The rest of the movie is just uninteresting, slowly paced, and incredibly boring. Not even the giant ""special effect"" action scenes could save the film. Sam Worthington is still pretty likable, but still needs a little more help in the ""line delivery"" department. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are pretty well-suited for their performances, but they look embarrassed to be here. As for Rosamund Pike, no way! I don't really think she can actually act, then she can kick butt! So, the acting is average, the writing is ridiculous, the pacing is slow, and the overall action is not that memorable. Now, I only saw pieces of the first movie, so I can't really try to compare one movie between the other. But here's what I can say, ""Wrath of the Titans"" is not an awful movie to be exact, because I enjoyed some scenes, and the first half was pretty entertaining.

76,Chris_Pandolfi,Now We Know What Happens When Gods Die,7,30 March 2012,"I think what I appreciated most about ""Wrath of the Titans"" is that, unlike its 2010 predecessor, I wasn't forced into making comparisons between versions. ""Clash of the Titans"" was, of course, a remake of the 1981 film of the same name. Many people thought I was insane for liking that film. Many more were angry that I had the gall to say the remake was better than the original. As much as I don't like to fan flames, there's really no getting around this: It was better. It utilized actors capable of real acting, thereby giving performances that were decent. Its plot, while silly, was vastly more entertaining. And there's absolutely no convincing me that Ray Harryhausen's crude, amateurish claymation effects can even remotely hold a candle to the slick, smooth CGI available to us today. The 1981 film was thirty years too early.Now we have ""Wrath of the Titans,"" and because it's a sequel and not a remake, all the pressures that come with distinguishing one version from another have been taken off me. I was free to enjoy the film for being no more or less than what it was: A fun and fast-paced action and special effects extravaganza. In 3D, of course. What I find both strange and amusing is that, although it was converted in post production from a 2D celluloid negative (which was also the case with the 2010 film), the 3D effects are surprisingly decent. They're not, however, anything to get worked up over – which is to say there's no real need for you to spend the extra money at the box office for a pair of 3D glasses. Follow my usual advice and see it in standard, noticeably brighter, and more affordable 2D.Ten years have passed since the events of the first film. The demigod Persius (Sam Worthington) now has a son named Helius (John Bell), whom he wishes to raise humbly as a fisherman despite his victorious reputation the slayer of the Kraken. As this is established, we learn that it's a dark time for the gods, as humanity's devotion and belief in them is rapidly waning. It seems that when you no longer believe in a god or goddess, he or she loses his or her powers. When all powers are drained, he or she dies. And unlike a mortal, who possesses a soul that can be transferred to the afterlife upon death, a god will simply disintegrate into oblivion. Unfortunately, this lack of faith is weakening the walls of an underworld fortress known as Tartarus, which imprisons all manner of giant, evil creatures. Should they escape, they will wreak havoc on humanity.Persius' father, the god Zeus (Liam Neeson), descends to the underworld to reunite with his banished brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), and his other brother, Poseidon (Danny Huston), in the hopes of reconciling their differences and rebuilding the cracked walls of Tartarus. But Hades has other plans. So too does Zeus' other son, the perpetually angry Ares (Owen Wilson, Jr.), who hates his father for preferring Persius. In exchange for guaranteed immortality, Hades imprisons Zeus and slowly begins draining him of his powers, which are then transferred to Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon's evil father, the god Kronos, a hellish monstrosity made of lava and volcanic rock. His dramatic escape from Tartarus paves the way for the final battle, a visually spectacular sequence if ever there was one.But before that happens, the initially reluctant Persius must leave his son behind and go on a quest to rescue his father. He will gain several sidekicks along the way. These include: Poseidon's son, the demigod Agenor (Toby Kebbell), a seafaring, wisecracking liar and thief; Agenor's mother, Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), who, despite being a cunning warrior, wears her dangly earrings in battle; and the fallen god Hephaestus (Bill Nighy), a weapons-maker and the architect of Tartarus. His years of isolation have made him certifiably insane. In fact, he frequently has arguments with the metal owl from the 1981 film, which appears to be deactivated. Is it possible for a robotic bird, active or otherwise, to take a stance on any particular issue?The journey will inevitably include appearances by gigantic monsters and creatures of myth, including a family of hulking cyclopses, a two-headed fire-breathing beast with a snake-like tail, and the winged horse Pegasus. Persius will eventually have to gather Zeus' thunderbolt, Hades' spear, and Poseidon's trident to form the ultimate weapon: The Spear of Triam, apparently the only device capable of defeating Kronos. And, of course, he and his companions will eventually find their way into Tartarus, which is fortified by a mindbending yet surprisingly solvable labyrinth. You see what I mean about this movie being fun? Like its predecessor, ""Wrath of the Titans"" is not intended to be taken too seriously. It was made strictly with entertainment in mind, and entertained I was.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Wrath of the Titans

I knew going into this that these movies are catering toward the ""Transformers"" crowd, but I have to disagree with those that say this one is an improvement.2010's ""Clash of the Titans"" was ripped apart by almost everyone, and off course the original 1980 film was heaps better. I'm not going to say that the 2010 effort was great, it wasn't. But I wasn't too sorry to have spent a couple off hours watching some modern takes on some iconic scenes (such as the Medusa scene). This sequel has to stand on its own two feet a bit more, and it just doesn't cut it. Oh at first I thought it was to a similar standard as number one. But the more I think about it, the more I didn't like it.Spoiler alert ahead! Off course the plot wasn't going to be the best, but it starts out convincing you there's going to be one, before throwing in a bunch off other crap involving fathers, sons, more fathers, more sons, and then doing the most unlikely off things with its characters. I mean, I'm no expert on Greek mythology, but isn't Zeus indestructible? and Hades? Isn't he the evil God? ""Wrath of the Titans"" seems to avoid these things in a lame attempt to surprise us. But it just comes off like they've not even bothered looking into the history off these characters. As they're too busy coming up with ""action scenes."" What's not surprising is the films unforgiving and non-stop in this way, and I suppose that's what most will want/expect from this movie. There's a fight with two giant Cyclops which looked promising in the trailer. But everything else seems totally random, and there seems to be more sword fights and such, in an attempt to step away from the ""too much CGI"" complaints that people had first time round.Sorry guys, but you've tried too hard, and in the wrong direction.

Looks like they got the title itself wrong!! While stories of Greek gods, heroism and legends have long inspired movie makers, here, we have twisted tales that beat usual logic and that too for no good reason! For starters, we're told that Gods aren't immortal and are dependent on human prayers to stay so and are constantly in a mess. And, their only saviors are half-human, half-god 'heroes' who are to save the Olympian Gods. And then we have gods fighting one another for supremacy. Family drama in the heavens, Ouch! The story begins in the most clichéd manner with the hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) retiring to a quiet life of a fisherman. His immortal half- god consort, 'Io' in the first film is shown to have died. Turns out that Gemma Arterton who played the part then didn't have dates for the sequel. And he has a son Heleus. You see, in the movies, having a son or a lover means that the baddies can use them as pawn; how convenient! Back in the heavens, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), the lord of the underworld and Zeus' adversary has now teamed up with Ares (Édgar Ramírez), the god of war. The Gods are in trouble with the treacherous duo maim Poseidon and trap Zeus (Liam Neeson) in Tarturus so that they can use his power to revive the Kraken, a titan. The Gods pin their hopes on Perseus who is unwillingly uprooted from a peaceful life into the thick of the battle. Sam Worthington looks tired and seems disinterested. And then we have Queen Andromeda (bond girl Rosamund Pike) who looks her part as a queen but not too well suited for action sequences. Joining them is Agenor (Toby Kebbell) who like Perseus has one godly parent; in this case, Poseidon. While the trio head into Tartarus, mythology too is sent for a toss! One wonders what the part-man part bull Minotaur was doing in Tartarus and getting killed by Peresus instead of Thesus. While the digression is not a problem in itself, the battle lacks the punch and is over within seconds, that too under poor lighting! The key selling point of the film was supposed to be its special effects. While its 2010 predecessor had the alibi that it was converted to 3D later, this entrée was supposed to have been better. But then, the special effects are nothing awesome.At best, 'Wrath of the Titans' can be described as a half-baked but expensive outing for the young director, Jonathan Liebesman.

They were just rushing towards the final scene. Things like these make me sick. I already knew that the film is bad and I will regret my time after watching. But on the positive side the action sequences like the previous one are again good to watch at least once. It's like you should just scroll the film just to see the action sequences and you will never feel like you are missing anything special from the film i.e you will get the story even if you see the action scenes only. Well there are a lot of things that we can identify are bad in the film. The first ones are the dialogs which were, believe me irritating.

83,RichardSRussell-1,Daddy Complex of the Stereotypes,5,30 March 2012,"Wrath of the Titans (1:39, PG-13, 3-D) — 5 — fantasy: sword & sorcery, biggie, sequelHere, in response to no obvious demand, we have Sequel of the Titans. What follows is less a coherent review than a collection of observations.(1) The plural is misleading. There's only 1 titan, Cronos, and he's off-screen for 90% of the film. He's been imprisoned in Tartarus for eons, which explains why he's wrathful. What is never satisfactorily explained (or even addressed) was how this mountain-sized lava monster ever procreated, since he's supposed to be the father of much smaller and more human-like gods like feuding brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades.(2) Don't go in with any pre-conceived ideas based on actual Greek mythology. It's a 2011 story featuring characters left over from 2010's Clash of the Titans.(3) Warner Bros. threw a lot of money at this, and most of it shows up on the screen.(4) It's pretty much non-stop fighting (vs. chimeras, cyclopes, a minotaur, and assorted gods and demigods), not entirely at the frenetic pace of Transformers, where things are flying by too fast to figure out who's doing what to whom, but too much so for my taste.(5) The story is not going to win any Pulitzers, Nobels, or Hugos, but it's not entirely predictable, and anything that contemplates the total extinction of the gods gets a big plus from me.(6) Despite having some pretty good actors in here (Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Danny Huston, and, yes, Sam Worthington), they don't really get much chance to practice their craft, but they're not just phoning it in, either.(7) Based on the damage he absorbed, Perseus should have been dead or permanently crippled on over a dozen occasions. Absence of credible consequences makes it difficult to establish serious threats or build suspense.(8) Psychologists who are fixated on the idea of daddy complexes will love this. Normal people will spend a lot of time rolling their eyes.(9) Rosamund Pike is along for the ride as Queen Andromeda, and she gets in a few licks, but mainly she cleans up real good.(10) I'm fonder of 3-D than most, so FWIW I thot it was put to good use here in the swooping shots thru the burning villages, labyrinth, and pits of hell. Mercifully, no pokey-outy sharp things, but I had to duck the occasional flaming boulder.(11) This will not tax your intellect, but it's a well-paced, semi-interesting, action-packed ludicrously unbelievable adventure. They could have done worse, and so could you.",Wrath of the Titans
84,achyutaghosh,Spectacular yet uninvolved,7,1 April 2012,"Wrath of the Titans ushers the summer crop of mindless blockbusters of 2012, in moviedom it is a rarity for the fact that it is a sequel that is way better than its predecessor, Clash of the Titans. While this task was not too hard to accomplish given how bad the Clash of the Titans was, class leading 3D visual effects ensure that the sequel provides a decent way to kill an hour and a half.So Perseus, (played woodenly by Sam Worthington), after having vanquished the Kraken and saved the world, takes up voluntary retirement from his violent ways. 10 years down the line, he is leading a life of peace as a fisherman with his son Helius when his father Zeus decides to pay him a visit to enlist his support to face the coming calamity. The gods are getting weak as the humans have stopped praying to them, this weakened status is making them mortal, and also pre-empting the release of the Titans from their captivity. For those not well versed in Greek mythology- the Titans were the predecessors to the modern Olympian Gods, who overthrew them in a bloody conflict known as the Titanomachy. Kronos is the father of most of the Olympian Gods, including Zeus, and is imprisoned in Tartarus, a labyrinthine jail the size of which can put entire planets to shame. Perseus unwisely declines to help his father. But Hades- lord of the underworld and Ares- the God of War, connive together to capture Zeus so that they can sacrifice him to Kronos, on which Kronos will regain his powers, and destroy the world, yet ensure immortality for the Gods that side with him. Zeus's capture begins the countdown to chaos, as monsters begin descending on earth, and Perseus finally unsheathes his sword. To prevent the world coming to an end, he has to travel to the underworld to rescue Zeus, but then he is only a demi-god, so he will need a team to achieve this objective- which includes the demi-god Agenor, son of Posiedon, played comically by Toby Kebell, the banished God Hepheastus, played excellently by Bill Nighy, and warrior Queen Andromeda, played by Rosamund Pike. The rest of the movie is a slam-bam nonstop action, with visual glory being its USP. Wrath of the Titans has some of the best use of 3D since Avatar- i was literally dodging boulders at times, literally breathing the embers and dust of Tartarus, and actually turned my head back and marveled to see brave Perseus flying in on Pegasus from somewhere behind me to take out Kronos. There is monster mayhem which includes a three headed chimera, a trio of Cyclops, even a minotaur, and two headed four armed creatures. And then there is the depiction of Tartarus- a giant, shape shifting labyrinth of sorts that requires well timed jumping, and running. At 90 minutes, the movie is thankfully short, the depiction of Greece is spectacularly original and earthy, and the overall camera-work is suitably frenetic. And therein lies the movie's biggest weakness- Gods, demi gods and monsters bashing each other, smashing through stone and ravaged by fire, flying horses, the father of the Gods depicted as a massive mountain of lava- everything in this movie boiled down to little more than a visual spectacle, it is like a video game, with no real sense of involvement or feeling.And then there is the small matter of the cast- mind you, all big names here, but almost everyone is in a permanent state of coma, awakening only to utter some banal one liners, and then going back to sleep. Sam Worthington is only 35 but has the entertainment world at his feet- he gets to play characters as diverse as a Terminator, Avatar, Perseus and yet he plays them all with the same expression, he has failed to be more than just a pretty face. Rosamund Pike looks mighty fetching in leather skirt, but has a wasted role, and their chemistry is so bad that it feels like almost a shocking twist of sorts when we get to know towards the end of the movie that Andromeda and Perseus have romantic feelings. Liam Neeson as Zeus goes about manfully on his current preferred role of fighting for his child, while Ralph Fiennes as Hades seems to have reserved his venom for Harry Potter only.Will this movie rake in the moollah at the box-office? The answer is YES- if its shoddy precursor made USD 500 million, this should easily better it. Will I remember this movie 3 months down the line? The answer is a solid NO. Was I entertained? The answer is a YES. Because at the end, whether you like any movie or not will depend upon what expectations you take in with you when you enter the theater. With a name such as the Wrath of Titans, the horror of its first installment, and the general trend towards graphic, high body count features, i did not expect an award winning, heart touching experience, just some solid popcorn entertainment. I got something more than what I expected, and hence came out smiling and satisfied.7/10 for a spectacular though uninvolved ride- hop on if you have nothing better to do this weekend.",Wrath of the Titans
85,mgruebel,Wrath over Clash!,5,9 February 2014,"Sam Worthington reprises his role as Perseus, and Liam Neeson gets a meatier role as Zeus in this follow-up film to the 2010 remake of ""Clash of the Titans.""This is a rare case where the sequel is actually better than the remake it is based on. In the latter, the legend of Perseus was distorted into a mish-mash of copies of Ray Harryhausen special effects and unnecessary liberties with the Greek legend.""Wrath"" on the other hand is an original script, and not bad for an action adventure venture, if you give up on the idea that it has much to do with recorded Greek mythology.Instead, you get a story of father-brother-son redemption between Zeus, Hades, Ares (Mars to those who prefer Latin), and his half-brother Perseus. It brings up themes of forgiveness and redemption, at a level where they contribute to the story's development, but without being too heavy-handed. This is a teen action flick, after all.Another interesting element is the mortality of Gods: they really exist only as long as men worship them. This hints that they are a creation of man more than man is a creation of them. Although nothing could be more different in style, I had to think of an old Star Trek episode from the 1960s original series, ""Who Mourns for Adonis."" (Adonis = Apollo) Star Trek does a better job in much less time, but then, it is classic Star Trek for a reason. ""Wrath"" still nicely explores this theme.The backdrop is Hades' desire to seek revenge against his brother Zeus by freeing their colossal father and ur-God Cronos (Crown in Greek). Ares is drawn to the wrong side, Perseus to the right side. Adventures ensue with cyclops, fire-breathing double-headed giant hyenoids, Janus-abdomen warrior beasts, gigantic labyrinths that change shape around you, slobbering Satyrs, and finally Cronos himself, who emerges as a volcano-sized fire-spewing elemental.It's better than ""Wrath,"" but it still sits solidly in 5-star B-movie territory: wooden acting, lots of very un-Hellenic one liners, gratuitous stealing from Lord of the Rings memes (like the famous 'the fellowship traverses the ridge scene,' but without Howard Shore's great score), the obligatory female along on the quest for political correctness, and oodles of inconsistencies (Poseidon's son is also a half-god, but would die if he falls out of a tree-hung trap, whereas Perseus can be slammed by Ares through marble columns with nary a scratch on his face, etc etc).The action is solid, the story is more original and with interesting themes, the CGI is fine, and the 90+ minute length befits a good B matinée.",Wrath of the Titans
86,SpoilerAlertReviews,Wrath of The Review: ONLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN IT!,4,18 April 2012,"Wasn't particularly a fan of the first and sadly couldn't see any improvements here. Boasting to have long, good action scenes I found it to be a little more than a worthy try. Thought the plot messy and weak and just didn't pack enough punch. Didn't notice much of a score and casting... well... Sorry Sam, there's just something missing, I can't put my finger on it, but you don't portray the action hero for me. Maybe in essence you are more true to form because there seems to be a lot of luck involved and happy accidents as oppose to actual heroics. Really, You got lucky with the Chimera, your son helped you and to be brutally honest, no wonder Pegasus dislikes you, he actually won the day!Great fan of both Mr Kebbel and Mr Nighy, but was left on tender hooks awaiting for them to do something big screen worthy. There was that moment Hephaestus was going to attempt to kick-ass and you know what, I think it would have been an excellent twist if he did. Nice touch with the ""release the Kraken"" reference, echoing a nod to Mr. Nighy's previous Davy Jones role. I would love to see Rosamund Pike more, but I also greatly miss Gemma Arterton. As for Neeson and Fiennes, I can't help but think considering their recent bouts, both Gods have gone to character counselling. Emotional stuff Hades and Zeus! As for the direction, there was plenty of opportunity to awe the audience but it came across rushed and anti-climatic. Not the epic I was expecting to see. Having said all this, I need to remind myself this is fantasy action flick possibly for the younger audiences and isn't trying to be a 300 or Immortals, but it's own adventure and I think it succeeds at that. Yes, lacking something new but at least it wasn't trying to be something it wasn't. Very much like the previous, was a good effort, just not quite there yet. Oh.. The labyrinth pleasantly reminded me of Krull, thumbs up for that!",Wrath of the Titans
87,julian-mumford,"Nobody takes it too seriously, nor should you",6,27 July 2012,"After a worldwide take of nearly $500 million, a sequel to the critically panned reboot of ""Clash of the Titans"" was perhaps inevitable, taking around $300 million the usual ""law of diminishing returns"" has applied here.When we left Perseus, demi-god son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) he had defeated the Kraken, won the girl and all was well. He has now retired to the simple life of a fisherman, enjoying the company of his young son Helius, following the death of his wife.Of course, the simple life cannot continue if we are to have an action movie and sure enough, he is soon called upon to rescue his father from the evil clutches of Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares (Edgar Ramirez) who is using Zeus to retain his own immortality by appeasing his father ""Kronos"". Kronos for his part, has reduced power as the ordinary folk move away from worshipping the gods.Kronos, a mass of fire and stone, is understandably a bit peeved at being cast into the dungeons of Tartarus, part of the Underworld, following his earlier overthrow by Zeus, Hades and Poseidon.If you think this all sounds like one big ""Greek Tragedy"", then yes of course it is, the original in fact and yes there will be a test later.Following an attack on his village and a quick bit of Chimera slaying, Perseus flys off astride his trusty Pegasus to see Queen Andromeda. Andromeda is now played by the shapely Rosamund Pike clearly having fun ordering Centurions around whilst speckled with fresh fake blood.A quest is what is needed and Perseus is tasked with locating Hephaestus (Bill Nighy), the maker of the trident, lightning bolt and pitchfork with the help of Agenor (Toby Kebbell). Following an encounter with some rather large and angry cyclops, they locate the weapon maker who also incidentally designed and constructed Tarturus. This huge maze like structure, with of course a Minotaur thrown in for good measure, has a secret back door entrance left for Hephaestus to use during it's construction.The party continue to be dogged by Ares who pops up at will to decimate the troops, seemingly whenever he is prayed for or too.The dwindling group move ever onwards until the inevitable massive climax which aims to outdo the previous film's Kraken encounter. Whether that is achieved is debatable but the ending leaves everyone looking rather tired which does not bode well for the third and completing film, if there is to be one.It is difficult to criticize a film that sets out to be daft, mocks itself at every opportunity, with actors and filmmakers having fun and puncturing any pomposity with a modern slang put down. Nobody actually says ""whatever"" but you get the idea.Bill Nighy's character and scenes come across like ""Monty Python and the Life of Brian"" and there is no gravitas or sense of heft to any of the scenes or characterizations, despite the acting talent on display. Half an extra star added as no one actually asks, ""what have the Romans ever done for us?"".You can imagine Greek scholars gnashing their teeth as this mash up of mythologies pays fast and loose with classic stories and ""facts"". Is this the worst type of Hollywood blockbuster, probably but you should be under no illusion when you buy the ticket.The very definition of popcorn film-making, lots of it but lacking any substance whatsoever.Summary If you enjoyed the first film you will know what to expect and should not be too disappointed.For those new to the series, this is a sword and sandals epic with lots of fighting, monsters and collossal amounts of CGI, with actors and film maker tongues placed firmly in their cheeks.Nobody takes it too seriously, nor should you.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",Wrath of the Titans
88,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film review: A Titanic smack down.,8,30 March 2012,"The Wrath of the Titans came with action right out the gates of Tartarus. I was a little surprised that the fun began so quickly, but it didn't last. We get this great battle as Perseus (Sam Worthington) faces the Chimera, and then we are taken to school for a Greek mythology lesson. This film does look deeper at the Gods, specifically the relationship of the top brothers. The three major Gods seen in the Clash of the Titans have returned, including Liam Neeson as Zeus. Fortunately, his role is so much more expanded this time around and not completely defined by one catch phrase. Releasing the Titans was exactly what takes place in this story and it is pretty spectacular to witness. Practically every mythical creature ever conceived in Greek mythology was on display and in some battle with Perseus. Since he pretty much lost everyone who fought beside him the last time he now teams up with some new comrades, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) who is leading the Greek army into battle and Agenor (Toby Kebbell) who is a bit of a scoundrel. The entire film took a very somber serious tone, I kept thinking man this is dramatic. It wasn't until well into the 99 minutes running time that we get some comic relief from Hephaestus (Bill Nighy). The tone lightened up for a minute, then Ares (Edgar Ramirez) makes a really cool entrance and then into the labyrinth we go, which was absolutely stunning. I was very impressed by the special effects in this film. Aside from how realistic all the titans appeared, a few other things crossed my mind, one that I really liked and the other I considered must have been for realism. This series is the first time that I have seen Pegasus as a black beauty, which coordinated very well with how dirty everyone stayed throughout the entire film. In battle who has time for a shower before, 'action'! Good thing Perseus is a demi-god otherwise he would have never survived all the times that he was hurled into a rock or a stone pillar. This story is not plot driven, it's not character driven and with all the different accents in Greece, which were a bit distracting, but if a film could stand solely on the special effects and the realism that you would expect in the chance that you meet a Cyclops then this it that film. It was entertaining, I'm a Greek mythology fan and I give it a green light.",Wrath of the Titans
89,BigWhiskers,Basically Waterworld of The Gods,2,18 April 2012,"Remember Waterworld. Bloated budget Mad Max goes to sea type movie . Well this is definitely similar in bloated budget and a bomb to boot. This movie plays like a tongue in cheek Golan Globus movie. The special effects aren't all that good, for the 100 million plus price tag this is more about paying Liam Neeson and Fiennes the 10 or 20 million a piece as well as others . The story itself is boring and is a plodding mess. The whole plot of Zeus and Hades being brothers and their father this 100 foot tall lava giant trying to destroy the world looks as if someone wrote it in a day and probably shot some scenes on the fly. Neeson tries to ham it up in a really badly written role of Zeus who has nothing more to do than laugh defiantly or get string up to hanging rocks and look beaten.Fiennes as Hades is even worse , the fake beard , the boring dialog and wooden acting need I say more. Worthington tries but he is also boring to watch and the so called Titans ? Where are they , we have a chimera, weird looking giants with 2 bodies in one and the 100 ft tall fire guy thing- none of them are Titans. And of course the HarryHausen type Cyclops - really look fake and superimposed but again where are the Titans?.... 2/10 and thats being generous",Wrath of the Titans
90,ksj870,Return of the Titans,8,28 June 2012,"Wrath of the Titans, which of course is a sequel to 2010's Clash of the Titans, is one of those rare examples of a follow-up which is superior to the original. The plot is still very much secondary to the action and special effects, but the screenwriters at least take the basic ideas from Clash in some novel directions, while likewise bringing certain aspects of the Perseus myth back into line with the classic story both movies are based upon.As Wrath of the Titans opens, the god Zeus (Liam Neeson) visits his half-human son Perseus (Sam Worthington) to seek his help. It seems that people have turned away from the gods, denying them the worship that feeds their immortality. Given the fickle nature of the Greek gods, this may not sound like such a bad thing, but there is a catch: as the gods lose their power, so too do the walls of Tarterus, the underworld prison where the most powerful of the titans, Kronos, is chained. If Kronos escapes, the entire world could be destroyed by his vengeance.It's an epic plot, and one the film more often than not manages to live up to. The special effects are incredible, and the various mythological creatures that the script calls for are brilliantly realized in all their glory: fire-breathing chimeras, multi-armed demons that mow through ranks of human soldiers like buzzsaws, giant one-eyed Cyclopes, the beautiful flying horse Pegasus, and of course the massive Kronos, a walking maelstrom of volcanic wrath.The cast isn't half bad, either. Worthington is given a much more sympathetic version of Perseus to play this time, as opposed to the sometimes annoying, self-righteous youth he portrayed in Clash of the Titans. Perseus is a bit more mature now, as is only befitting since he is now a father. Young John Bell acquits himself honorably as Helius, Persus's son, while Ralph Fiennes reprises his role of Hades, Zeus's scheming brother, with obvious relish. Bill Nighy and Edgar Ramirez join the cast as Hephaestus and Ares, respectively, with Rosamund Pike replacing Alexa Devalos as Andromeda, whose relationship with Perseus hints at turning full circle despite the platonic friendship established in the previous film. It's a surprisingly well-acted film, and the script takes advantage of Perseus's own paternal love for Helius to explore his strained relationship with Zeus to good dramatic effect.Generally better written, acted, and plotted than Clash of the Titans, Wrath of the Titans takes the formula from its predecessor and improves upon it in most respects. Though not as good as last year's Immortals (for my money the best movie derived from Greek mythology yet produced), Wrath of the Titans is a highly entertaining fantasy showcase.",Wrath of the Titans

One of them is definitely the one where the main character is portrayed as powerful at one moment and not so much at another, so the next scenes like those are certainly the fights of people with the titans against whom they have no minimal chance.

However the sequel, WRATH OF THE TITANS, suffers more-of-the-same weaknesses -- cardboard characters, weak plot and erratic pacing.

Sam Worthington outdoes himself in this one, as the most bland lead actor of all time - including even Bill Paxton. The FX are BIG but what exactly does that do for a film? Hot air balloons are big too. I saw this in 2D (thank goodness), which might have been the saving factor. 3D is such a headache and blurry irritation, that the already blurred and hyperactive monster animations would have been a mess.The only thing that saves this movie from being utter **** is the promise of some big fiery guy (Chronos) being unleashed to wreak havoc. When he does, it is a bit of a disappointment but not too bad.I saw this with my 6 year old son. Not recommended for adults.",Wrath of the Titans

95,chaz-28,The Titans have daddy issues and humanity pays the price,3,10 April 2012,"The ancient Greek mythological realm is ready made for Hollywood script writers. There are seething rivalries, petty jealousies, jilted lovers; pretty much every conflict known to man is already pre-packaged with at least a few immortal deities to go along with it. Even with all of this rich material, Wrath of the Titans chose 'daddy issues' as its central conflict and plot instigator. When you are dealing with names as powerful as Zeus, Hades, Ares, and Perseus, daddy issues cannot be the first story idea which jumps to mind.Oh, where to begin to describe this ridiculous story. Perseus (Sam Worthington) and his son, Helius (John Bell), reside by the sea as fishermen and seem to be living an enjoyable, yet isolated, life. Perseus's dad, Zeus (Liam Neeson), drops by seeking his son's help warning of dark days to come. Perseus, ever mindful that daddy did not pay him very much attention as a child, refuses and sends Zeus on his way. Zeus meets up with another of his sons, Ares (Edgar Ramirez), to go and meet Hades (Ralph Fiennes) in the underworld to see what is making all of the trouble. Oops, Zeus's poor parenting strikes again. Ares, jealous of his father's love for his half-brother, Perseus, teams up with Hades, also jealous of Zeus, and starts torturing Zeus and tries to wake up Zeus's daddy, Kronos.This script received thumbs up from the green lighters? This is Hollywood's big budget mythological movie this year? Daddy didn't pay attention to me; daddy likes my brother more than me, so now I feel like destroying half of the world. Oh, and the Gods are starting to lose their powers. Why, because humans do not prey to them anymore. It turns out that the Greek Gods are like fairies in Peter Pan. If you do not believe in them and clap your hands, they fall down and die. Here comes Perseus to save the day. First, though, he must put together an ad hoc band of heroes to travel down into the underworld and set things right. He picks the beautiful Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike) who is required to look good with some dirt smeared on her cheeks rather than to provide any useful qualities to the group. Perseus also picks up another demigod, Agenor (Toby Kebbell), a son of Poseidon. Agenor appears to be an ancient Greek version of Russell Brand. Together, this disparate group encounters Cyclops, the God Hephaestus (an annoying Bill Nighy), the Minotaur, and evil creatures which have two torsos wielding four swords but share the same legs. There are plenty of technical special effect achievements to marvel at though. The Cyclops are very well done as is Kronos who after being turned to stone for so long lets the lava flow. Those leg-sharing double torso guys are also pretty intriguing to watch as they swivel around chopping up tiny humans. The editing process would have benefited from a bit of a leash though; Perseus's fight with the Minotaur is almost impossible to watch and as a result, the audience never gets a very good look at the monster. There are just way too many cuts in that scene to make it seem incredibly frantic. Wrath of the Titans is a misleading title. It should be called, ""The Titans' Offspring Cannot Move Past Their Childhoods and as a Result, the Puny Humans Must Suffer."" Last fall's Immortals is superior in comparison because the character's motives are more understandable and the Gods seem almost normal instead of caricatures inside a soap opera melodrama. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from Wrath of the Titans.",Wrath of the Titans
96,jacklmauro,Next: Therapy of the Titans,4,15 August 2012,"Yes, 4. It flows along briskly and Sam is nice to look at. The effects - and I cannot believe anyone still gets jazzed up over effects - are fine as well. The problems, however, include cutesy humor that falls flat (Pegasus whacking Sam with a wing, moments of hip chatter) because Worthington is too damn dull to make it work. Then, there's the really, really big problem of no logic or continuity in these things. As in - ALL the gods except bitchy Ares ""fled"" when trouble began? Ares is suddenly jealous of a demi-god? Cronos is a volcanic mountain, while his sons are awfully human in form? Best of all: Hades claiming that mortals get to go somewhere after dying, but gods just vanish, which begs the question of the real value in godhood. Yes, have fun with mythology (although why, with thousands of great Greek myths to choose from, they have to invent a story or drag in a Scandinavian beast, as in the 'Clash', is beyond me). But, really, you've got to have some damn logic. If Ares can pop out of the sky and kick ass, why does a stone labyrinth door seem to stop him? Anyway. Worst of all is the Oprah-esque dad/son bonding issues shoved down your throat. As I said about the first one - just make Sam naked. A little.

98,s_campanale,Not a great film but better than one would expect given the original,6,25 April 2012,"My first thought when I saw the trailer was surprise: Surprise that this film had been made at all! Unlike the 2010 remake, this does not carry the baggage of either the 1981 original nor even of actual events from Greek Mythology. It stands and falls on its own merits. While not a great movie, it is however an entertaining one, with some excellent use of 3D that had us all ducking from rocks and lava and feeling breathless on roller-coaster rides down tunnels and caverns. Plot-wise it follows on from the 2010 films universe rather than actual Greek mythology, so we still have the silly ""Gods will die without prayers"" idea fuelling the narrative. The most interesting thing I found about this film is how it attempts to repair some of the worst errors of the 2010 film, and in that it reminded me a lot of ""The Mummy Returns"", the 2001 sequel to the 1999 ""The Mummy"". That movie also took an established narrative, mythology and characters and played fast and loose with them often in a way that made any fan of them uncomfortable. The sequel then took that films worst mistakes as a starting off point, and reworked a new narrative that made them look like parts of a larger, more sensible story slowly unfolding rather than script gaffs. So too does ""Wrath"". Sam Worthington, who in the original was a meat-headed, stubborn idiot motivated only by hate and anger who has to effectively be carried by every other friendly character in the movie, here seems older, wiser, and calmer, a more mature Perseus who seems to be painfully aware of just what an asshole he used to be. His main antagonist, Ares god of war (a very good Edgar Ramirez) is made in the image of the ""Clash"" Perseus, a stubborn angry fool blindly motivated by petty hate, jealousy and rage, so in a way he is fighting the shadow of his former self, repeating his own tragedy, which is an interesting way to put a little drama into the story. Andromeda is also better served here. Perseus' great love of legend and 1981 movie, she was relegated to plot point in the 2010 film as newly created Io took her place. Gemma Arterton, flavour of the month in 2010, didn't come back for second helpings, so her character is killed off-screen, a quickly glimpsed grave all the reverence she is given, which allows Andromeda to now retake her rightful place at Perseus's side. Many have complained at Rosamund Pike's casting, but it's spot on. Being set 10-12 years after the first film, it would make sense to have an older actress play her, and she also bears a reasonable resemblance to Alexandra Davalos (2010 Andromeda). Her role as tough warrior and capable military commander actually fits in well with what we saw of her in the 2010 film, a smart and intelligent woman in a court full of idiots who is dumped by Perseus on a beach to become the great future hope of Joppa. The Andromeda we see here IS that hope become reality. Director John Liebsman also realises he has Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes to hand, and rather than using them as stunt casting actually makes them act, no great strain but enough to infuse the Zeus-Hades relationship with some actual feeling and pathos and again add a little sorely needed dramatic weight to the proceedings. Bill Nighy is also excellent as the half-mad recluse God Hephaestus, avoiding his usual stately menace and snobbish sneer for an Earthy ""working man"" heavenly metal-smith. Toby Kebell is the comic relief, played in Russell Brand mould, and brings a little humour to the film. The monsters are also a step up from the 2010 film. A Chimera (one of a whole force of them apparently) tears apart Perseus village effectively. The trio of Cyclops on Hephaestus island are well made, going back to the ""big fat man with one eye"" look rather than the scaly reptilian-bull style of the classic Harryhausen creation, and their fight with the heroes is exciting and well-shot. The Minotaur (or maybe it's just A Minotaur, one of a production line like the Chimeras) however looks awful, and its fight with Perseus is impossible to follow or understand. The ""double soldiers"" at the end are excellent, hacking and slicing their way through Andromeda's army like giant buzz-saws, and the big-bad, Kronos himself, is excellently realised, moving with real menace and power, dripping in scalding hot lava, pumping out black smoke and uttering fearsome cries in its ancient tongue. OK. So he doesn't last long, but he makes more of an impression that the Kraken did at the end of ""Clash"". All in all ""Wrath"" is an enjoyable little mythological B-film in the old ""Peplum"" traditions of European cinema, bearing little resemblance to actual Greek mythology and having a very simple ""get the mystical weapon – kill the bad guys – save the world"" storyline. The acting is good for this kind of film with a little drama and comedy as well. The effects are good (especially fiery Kronos) and it goes a long way to repairing the many ills of its disastrous predecessor. For a film which never needed to exist in the first place and for which there were no expectations whatever, these aspects alone make it a small but pleasant surprise.",Wrath of the Titans
99,austin-takahashi,Wrath of the Titans - 1.5 Stars,3,11 April 2012,"You don't have to observe real hard to notice that there's actually just one titan in ""Wrath of the Titans"". That would be the fearsome Kronos, a monstrous being who can be best summarized as a walking volcano with arms, legs, and a face. In the film's latest moments, smoke, ash and lava violently erupt from his crevices, which is exactly the sight you'd expect from someone who had just risen out from the hellish underworld.Before we get into anything else, let's do a quick background check. Kronos is the father of Zeus, Hades and Poseidon. Zeus (Liam Neeson) has a son named Ares, who like his father is also a god. Everything seems rather normal until Zeus decides to get in bed with a human. The woman then gives birth to Perseus, a half-god half-human fisherman. So this would make Kronos the grandfather of Perseus? But what about Helius, the son of Perseus? Can he be considered as one-forth god? You know what would have been a lot more interesting than this movie? A documentary about these characters having a family reunion.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/wrath-titans-movie-review/",Wrath of the Titans
100,joshua-303-92778,"Glitzy, noisy, and dumb",5,12 June 2012,"In this film, the Greek gods are reduced to GI Joe style characters.Much of the movie is: people falling down rock caverns, giants trying to kill people with rocks, and rocks coming alive and trying to kill people.Sam Worthington physically suits the role of Perseus, but as usual he has no range as an actor.The story is practically non-existent. What story there is, is pretty much 100% predictable.By the way, why are Greek temples always shown as ruins? This *is* ancient Greece. The temples were nice and new back then. (heh) Clearly they focused all their energy on the effects and sound, which *are* impressive. They save this movie from getting a zero.They lay the groundwork for another sequel at the end.

101,pepe4u22,fun popcorn movie,6,8 April 2012,went to this movie and had a good time. the movie takes place years after persesus has slain the kracken and after the death of his wife as he struggles to raise his son as a single parent. well of course there is a visit from his father zeus foretelling of a loss in faith of the gods and how evil in the form of kronos rising from there the movie takes off and it wonderfully entertaining. The movie has a fine pacing and the characters are quite good with wonderful turns by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes and as for the lead Sam Worthington does an acceptable job though he does have very limited range. The movie goes on another voyage to mythical place and meets mystical people like the cyclops and the world of hades and that is part of the appeal of these movies but only problem was Perseus's hair way too modern but that is just nitpicking. Enjoy the movie and eat your popcorn.,Wrath of the Titans

It had a good story to it, but there could have been a bit more action sequences.Kronos is supposed to be the ultimate God of Gods. He is the father of Zeus, Hades, and all of the other Gods. But similar to what was done in the first one with the Kraken, Kronos was only around for a few minutes at the end of the movie. So once again, all that hype throughout the movie to only see Kronos for a short moment.The Makhai were actually super extreme craziness. The Makhai is a humanoid demon creature that has two upper bodies connected by their backs. They were present during Kronos' attack, and they were ruthless. But it would have been better if there were more of them.",Wrath of the Titans
103,edwbur,better than the first. but thats not much of an improvement,5,16 April 2012,"wrath of the titans is the sequel to the box office hit clash of the titans starring Sam Worthington, Liam neeson, and Ralph fiennes. the three actors return for wrath of the titans. the plot is Zeus (Liam neeson) has been captured by hades (Ralph fiennes)and trapped in the underworld. chronos a volcanic villain type monster who is the father of Zeus and hades is weak and needs Zeus power to become what he one was. it is Perseus (Sam Worthington) job to go to the underworld and rescue his father. Perseus has a son but he in it for two seconds so he not worth discussing and not worth putting in the film. anyway Perseus leaves his son in the village and heads on a trail with the recently deceased Poseidon's son who's name i cant remember. once again he has no need to be in the film because there's no development to him at all, just like Perseus son. another problem with the film is it seems rushed. it was an hour and a half long, ninety-nine minutes to be exact and they rushed threw the whole movies. each scene felt cut and edited at times. it didn't seem to care much about the plot. the plot was there but the movie often forgot they had a plot. there was no character development to chronos who i thought was an interesting character. had a scary look, but thats it and they thought that would carry the film and make him important, but his final battle was also rushed and there was no need for him in this film. on a positive not they focused more on the relationship between Zeus and hades. and Liam neeson and Ralph fiennes had fantastic chemistry together and the two star performances. plus Liam neeson and Ralph fiennes are two of the greatest actors of all time, and the two actors that bring real acting and scene stealing moments in this film and all films. there two great actors. two very special people in the acting world. Sam Worthington is an actor i have mixed feelings about. i know hes trying to show audiences he doesn't need special effects to carry his films and have successful films but he does. he hasn't proved he can have a successful movie without the special effect. hes going to have to stop with the big budget movies and go smaller, like man on a ledge, which tanked at the box office and a critical flop. but it doesn't look like he'll be stopping with big budget films because hes got another titans movie and two more avatars. good luck Sam Worthington, your going to need it. but this film has great effect but thats it. Liam neeson and Ralph fiennes are the only two actors that brought real acting to the film. and the two actors were the best part of the film. there scenes i knew i would love and i did.for this film wait for it on DVD.",Wrath of the Titans

105,elliott78212,Awesome & Popping 3D go see it,7,30 March 2012,"OK as many have said the movie is vastly improved from the first one most notably the 3D here is excellent I was ducking, dodging it was great. The CGI was in a word Dynamic, the Cyclops, Chronos oh how I loved it and I'm a child of Ray HarryHausen Era this movie is a must see. There are so many improvements its hard to tell you all of them without spoiling it so I'm not gonna go there. The acting is much better everyone delivers most of all Sam Worthington's performance has more depth I did miss Gemma Atherton or the appearance of Apollo thats so minor in the greater scheme of things the pacing is perfect I was thrilled from start to finish.",Wrath of the Titans
106,JamesIan2021,Epic Sequel,8,12 May 2015,"Mighty and magnificent, Wrath Of The Titans is the ultimate battle against men and Gods, this is a powerful and epic sequel. From monstrous fights with deadly creatures to heart pounding sword fights, the action is fierce and doesn't stop. Sam Worthington returns as Perseus and he is joined by a whole new cast including the gorgeous Rosamund Pike as Andromeda, who really kicks ass. Toby Kebell and Bill Nighy join in the excitement, and also add humour and a few dark laughs along the way. But who can forget Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. What I love about the first film and this sequel is the brilliant cast. Although the Kronos sequence doesn't feature an epic roar like the Kraken did in the previous film, its still a mighty finale as is the fight between Ares and Perseus. Wrath features some stunning 3D, the action shots are incredible and the pop out moments are insane. I think the best 3D effects are seen in the maze, the depth is astounding and the environment stretches far away. Even simple shots of actors standing amongst backdrops of the Tartarus covered in lava and collapsing structures look breathtaking. Wrath is a fantastic sequel, I find it just as good as the Clash Of The Titans, except this time around the 3D is so much better and adds to the experience making it so much more immersive.",Wrath of the Titans
107,DJRMewzique,Another Potential Epic is Yet Another Epic Failure,3,30 March 2012,"Two years ago, I eagerly anticipated the release of the remake of one of my favourite films of all time, ""Clash of the Titans."" What I was given was a mess of a film in bad post-production 3D which needlessly messed with the original story of Perseus and his defeat of the Kraken...and turned my beloved Pegasus black.When a follow-up was announced, being a huge fan of all Mythology, even if it is tweaked for Hollywood's sake, I felt they could only improve on a second attempt after the epic failure of the first go-around.I was wrong.""Wrath of the Titans"" picks up a decade later with Perseus raising his only son alone after dismissing Zeus' offer of riches and power after his heroic defeat of the Kraken and the unexplained death of his wife (who I would have thought would have been Io but should really be Andromedabut remained unaddressed). As mortals lose their faith in the gods, the gods in turn lose more and more of their power and, consequently, the walls which imprison the Titans in Tartarus are weakening and the end of days is imminent.Zeus turns to his son to warn him of the threat and ask his help, but Persues declines.That is until he learns from Poseidon that Zeus' other son, Ares, turned against him and led him into a trap in Tartarus and Zeus is imprisoned by Hades , transferring all Zeus' power to Kronos, the leader of the Titans and Zeus' father, in exchange for immortality.And thus, Perseus learns that in order to save humanity, he must rescue his father and defeat Kronos and teams with Poseidon's demi-god son Agenor and Queen Andromeda who, as I mentioned, by all accounts and purposes, should already be his wife.The story itself has much potential, but sadly, the execution just falls flat. With far too many convenient twists and escapes, even by Mythology's standards, I found the events extremely difficult to swallow, the narrative being even too ridiculous for the likes of me. The whole film just sort of stumbles along like an adventure in special effects, with the actual storytelling as somewhat of a secondary element. Something which is becoming far too common these days.Even though it has just been a couple of years since Sam Worthington was thrust into the spotlight in ""Avatar"" and the last Titan film, he looks like he has aged two decades, having lost all of the sexy, hard-bodied spunk that is befitting a demi-god. He was a relatively unconvincing Perseus the first time around, and the sequel just confirms the notion.Everyone else's performance, including the return of Liam Neeson as Zeus, Danny Huston as Poseidon and Ralph Fiennes as Hades, are just fine, but acceptable performances in a mediocre film hardly lessen the disappointment.After having been so mortified by the disrespect ""Clash of the Titans"" showed the original production, one wouldn't think it could get worse. But at least that film aroused some sort of emotional reaction in me. The sequel didn't even manage to do that. It simply disappointed. No doubt I may be first in line for the third installment, already currently in pre-production, as hope always prevails...but that may be tentative while what will most assuredly be mediocre box office could throw a spanner in the works.But hey, at least the 3D was better.",Wrath of the Titans
108,aaronjbong,Being a Demigod Ain't That Fun,7,29 March 2012,"Perseus is back in this sequel to the 2010 poorly received remake of the 1984 classic, ""Clash of the Titans"". A decade has passed since his heroic defeat of the Kraken and things have changed a bit for Perseus and friends. However, just when he was about to have a good life, evil calls him back again to fight once more in an attempt alongside the gods to defeat the evil Titan lord, Kronos, from devouring the gods and obliterating all of mankind. ""Wrath of the Titans"" takes place a decade after the conclusion of the 2010 remake, so there's a slight change in life. Perseus is now a father and due to the death of his wife Io, a lone parent of 10-year-old-soon-to-be-hero Helius. After refusing the offer to given a rank between the gods of Olympus, he lives a quiet life as a fisherman with his son. Besides Perseus, Princess Andromeda is now Queen Andromeda and a fighter. Meanwhile, the gods are facing a crisis. Hades (god of the underworld) and Ares (god of war) have teamed up with Kronos, leader of the Titans. They had made a deal with him and to release him from Tartarus. To power up Kronos, they captured Zeus and drained him of his energy to feed Kronos, thus awakening him. If they successfully awaken Kronos, Kronos would then proceed to kill Zeus and his friends, and obliterate all of mankind in an attempt to rule the world once more. Just like its predecessor, this movie offers a lot of intense action sequences. This is one improvement from its predecessor, having more intense fighting scenes. There are many fights here, conducted between Perseus and many different creatures from the Greek myths. There's a fight between Perseus and the Minotaur in the labyrinth, a battle with a gigantic Cyclops, and many more battles with two-headed winged creatures, two-body-in-one monsters, and of course, the lava-fueled gigantic debris-coated Kronos for the climax. And add in the outstanding visual effects to enhance the action sequences. Anyone who's looking forward to violence will be pleased with this perfect blend of exciting action scenes and sophisticated visual effects. Talking about effects, let's talk about the 3D. The first film, being heavily marketed as a must- see 3D event, had dreadful 3D effects. Added as an afterthought, the 3D is just painful and does nothing to the film except charge the viewer some extra bucks. I was skeptical of watching it in 3D for this movie, but it seems the producers and crew have spent more time and paid more attention to the 3D effects of the film. The 3D here is a vast, massive improvement from the dreadful 3D effects of the first film. Occasionally, some of the items shown pop out of the screen. If you hated the 3D of the first film, reconsider before deciding to watch this film whether in 3D or not because the 3D here is just excellent. When it gets to story, this movie lacks at it. It has a simple plot that the movie rarely hangs on to. But that's not a problem, the movie does not aim to be a film with an intriguing, complex, sophisticated, mind-boggling plot, it aims to be a spectacular, eclectic mix of special effects and action scenes. The dialog is fairly simple, the acting was fair, and the plot was just not complicated. Nevertheless, ""Wrath of the Titans"" is a considerable improvement from the horrible 2010 remake of the 1984 classic. It has plenty of action sequences accompanied with dazzling visual effects for teenage boys to enjoy, excellent 3D effects for enhanced excitement, and a little bit of focus on the storyline to get things going. If you're anyone of the people who want to have some fun watching countless violent scenes and dazzling visual effects, have this movie a go. But if you're anyone who's more interested in seeing a movie with an intriguing plot and some more focus on the storyline, give this film a miss. Rating: 7/10Final Verdict: ""Wrath of the Titans"" is a vast improvement from the poor remake of the 1984 fantasy that offers plenty of action sequences, dazzling visual effects, satisfying 3D effects, and a little bit of storyline to get things going.",Wrath of the Titans
109,freydis-e,Incredibly annoying and lame,2,21 May 2017,"Why do people want to take the characters from Greek myth and make up different stories for them, particularly stupid and unoriginal ones like this? It's understandable in series like Xena, which run on so long they run out of sensible story ideas, but in a feature film?? Of course movies do change stories around, even with historical subjects, but this plot makes as much sense as having George Washington, trying to rescue Queen Elizabeth I who's been kidnapped by the Emperor Nero. Yes, it's that stupid.Almost nothing is good here. The casting is ridiculous, from Liam Neeson as a kind of Irish Zeus, who's been living in the USA a bit too long, on down. The acting ranges from bad to appalling, with even the likes of Edgar Ramirez as Ares (a ludicrous god to choose for chief bad guy – someone's been watching too much Xena, where at least they had Kevin Smith who could almost act) being way out-hammed by the ghastly scenery-chewing Rosamund Pike. Oh yes, and why did they take Andromeda on the adventure when she couldn't do anything at all (except over-act)? Of course – to have someone around to rescue – silly me! Even usually reliable folk like Bill Nighy seemed to have given up trying on this one.The story managed to be both silly and clichéd at the same time and contained nothing remotely of interest. The script was ghastly, mixing fantasy-speak: 'I am he!' with lines like: 'You gotta be kidding me.' The one good (well, not too bad) thing here was the effects. Lava-monsters are pretty easy to do, but winged horse Pegasus was actually quite impressive, though his colour-scheme was odd. This would have been a rock solid one star, as much of a waste of time as you're likely to find, but the effects get it up to two. It's a shame so many film-makers nowadays seem to think effects are all that matters. They must have spent a fortune on them here, surely enough to pay for a decent lead actor and a whole host of writers with better skills and ideas than this. Come to think of it, despite Clash of the Titans, no-one's ever done a really decent version of the original Perseus story, which is about a million times better than this rubbish.",Wrath of the Titans

To the reviewer who said all the main actors were waving their arms around looking dirty - Hahaha so true.The CGI was pretty amazing but obviously that alone can't carry the film.

In fact, I tend to get bored, when everything is falling apart in movies (like the finale of 'Prince of Persia'). It's like: OK, here we go again...I get so bored that I ask myself these questions during fight scenes (Perseus vs. Ares): If they can be stabbed, how come they can throw each other through stone columns and they stand right up again? Right.What I do like are the little things like humorous scenes or well-drawn characters. 'Wrath' has a few of those moments. Like when Pegasus punches Peseus for criticizing it's landing.I think that movies would profit from focusing on these little things instead of trying to be the biggest, most sensational movie ever made.Should I be worried about The Avengers?...",Wrath of the Titans

The special effects were phenomenal. OK, the script wasn't Academy Award winning but I think it conveyed the movie's message. Sam Worthington - what a dreamboat (but his character's dialogue was probably the most poorly written of all the actors)!!!! Rosamunde Pike - already has distinguished credits but absolutely has the potential for a stellar career in the movies. I kind of wish they had given Pegasus a little more face time but only because I am an animal lover! Liam Neelson put in a great performance as one would expect from a professional. Chronos - AWESOME!! My only objection is when the hero(s) entering Tartarus and what seemed to be an endless procession (and boring) of concrete slabs dropping or shifting. But I would unequivocally recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yes.",Wrath of the Titans
113,RyanEberhart,Excellent!,10,5 January 2014,"If you haven't guessed by now I am attempting to connect one movie to another in some way or another. Connecting the previous movie to The Wrath of the Titans is actor Sam Worthington. Although I could have connected using Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes, I chose to use Sam Worthington.Worthington reprises his role from Clash of the Titans as Perseus. Liam Neeson reprises his role as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes reprises his role as Hades. In Wrath of the Titans Hades teams with Ares (Edgar Ramirez), the God of War, to take down Zeus and Poseidon (Danny Huston) and release Kronos.In order to save Zeus Perseus must team with Agenor (Toby Kebbell) and Queen Andromeda (Rosamund Pike). Agenor is Perseus' cousin, a son of Poseidon. Queen Andromeda was saved by Perseus in the previous movie, she became queen when both her mother and father were killed.Just like the last movie I liked the mythology of it all. Although it is completely different using creative license by the writers. Since the writer wrote Io as deceased, Gemma Arterton did not reprise her role. However, Rosamund Pike is an equally beautiful substitute.The graphics are awesome and spectacular. Especially when Kronos is released from his prison and brings his wrath down upon Zeus, Hades and all human-kind. Perseus saves the day after killing his brother, Ares. The action scenes are pretty cool. The labyrinth is pretty cool also.I give this 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!",Wrath of the Titans
114,unemployedvirgin,it was good but i wanted MORE,5,4 November 2012,"I'm probably in the majority in saying that the first film took itself too seriously in projecting character development. Whilst Wrath is a visually stunning piece of work in 1080p, it didn't leave much to the imagination.Don't keep your hopes up for the action as much as I did since the trailer pretty much gives away all the best parts. That was a real downer to say the least. I felt that their could've been more CGI monster scenes than actual storytelling since this is one of those types of movies. The soundtrack gets old real quick as the same tones are repeated when contrasting from one characters journey to the protagonist's. This downplays the continuity of screenplay as the minutes trail.Just my opinion but the creatures looked kind of goofy, in terms of their presentation. Not something that insights fear but more comical than aggressive. I did however appreciate the story revolving more around an action flick than to have dragged out making-out scenes to kill time and make your girlfriend feel welcome at the theatre. From the looks of it this seems to be the build up for another sequel. Which isn't a good feeling to figure out when your half way in without a cliffhanger. Since that sets up any anticipation level to dip severely low.It had a good cast, great camera work, smart budgeting with its production and editing. Yet it missed out a lot of the visceral intensity most mythical epics have. For that reason I down-rated it to a 5. With the stand alone story on it's own? probably a 7. To sum it up in 6 words:Wanted more violence, got more drama.",Wrath of the Titans
115,ivo_shandor,Uggghhh....,1,30 March 2012,"I have never in my life seen a sequel that destroyed itself before it even opened in theaters. That's the sign of one of the worst film sequels ever made to a film that was terrible to begin with. First of all, it is said that in the remake, the titans were killed by the Kraken. As stupid as that was to begin with, why are the titans in this film then? Oh right, because the writers can't write. Clearly no one in this film knew what continuity was. Why is it called wrath of the titans, when there are no titans in it, only one? Wow, you even got your title wrong, Wrath of the one Titan, and the others we couldn't afford. How bad is your film when you can't even get the title right. That thing called the Chimaera is not the chimaera, you know how I know? I studied something called, oh what was it....Oh that's right, Greek mythology. I have no clue why Andromeda is in this at all, she didn't do anything of any significance whatsoever in the first film. Why is she here? Why is she played by an even worse actress? Isn't it sad when the only true film to Greek mythology is Disney's Hercules? Granted some flaws, but nonetheless. Why does Perseus go to Andromeda at the end, they never had a previous relationship? I have never seen a film fail so miserably, never....Why is it now I am witnessing the worst, the dumbest films in the history of cinema? Apparently gods can die in this series, really? Then why are they IMMORTAL....I think someone needs to look that up in the dictionary. And why is it that gods can't do anything with their powers? In the remake, Hades said, ""I must regain my powers."" When did you lose them, you idiot? Why doesn't zues just strike down everybody? I don;t know why the gods keep dying when they're supposed to be immortal? How bad is your film if you destroy your own mythos?

Its not going to blow you away with its script or acting but I would never go into this kind of filming thinking that, what it does is grab you and pull you along on a good old action fantasy film. Better than the first film in both scope/effects/and wow factor. The story is all it needs to be, good vs bad blah blah. Looks wise the film is very good, its all done very well and no real ""oh dear did they run out of money"" moments, in fact I am a bit shocked at how much they put in, I mean normally its action/talk/action/talk....big end fight, but this time once the film gets going the action is almost none stop and if not wowing you with action then is giving you great spectacle of the underworld and the beautiful landscapes they travel along. I think if you take it for what it is this is a very good movie, it gives you action and entertainment by the bucket load. I gave it 9 out of 10, high for me but I score a film on what it has achieved, it does not set out to try and be something its not, its just a simple straight in there action fantasy film.........and a bloody good one at that. Oh one thing I did not like....the music is great but there is one fight where you can hear some electric guitar ahem! not really fitting.",Wrath of the Titans
117,ticket_for_one,Wrath of the Titans removes any memory of the hideous first film.,8,3 April 2012,"This is one of the rare occasions where the sequel is far better than the original. And guess what? THE 3D ACTUALLY WORKS!!! Again I had my doubts because the first film was dreadfully poor, but Wrath of the Titans delivers and puts its predecessor in the shade. Most of the original cast return and Sam Worthington does even better this time round than his last outing as demi god Perseus. Liam Neeson again does no wrong in my book and continues to deliver another solid performance as Zeus, likewise with Ralph Fiennes. I thought Hades was the highlight of the first film and here Fiennes continues where he left off. Also support from Rosmund Pike, Esteban Ramirez and Toby Kebbell is most welcome. They too put good performances and contributed immensely to my enjoyment of the film. I really had a good time with this. This is the second Johnathan Liebesman film I've had a great time watching, the first being Battlefield: Earth. Liebesman's film is action packed and special effects laden feast of fun. He does a good job of focusing on the story as well as filming great action sequences and because of this the film doesn't drag one bit. From start to finish, from the off the adventure starts and doesn't stop until, well the end. The fight scenes against the giant Cyclopes and the labyrinth Minotaur are standouts, as is the finale. The only problems I had with Wrath as the Titans was the dialogue wasn't great and Bill Nighy, who makes a cameo playing Hephaetus the weapon forger of the Gods, was terrible comic relief. He totally ruined the dark tone I thought the film was trying to create. He puts on a northern accent and sounds rather like Frank Gallagher from Shameless, just without the cigarettes and six pack of Stella Artois.All in all, Wrath of the Titans removes any memory of the hideous first film. Great action, muscular set pieces and good performances. Is this worth a trip to your local movie house and a Blu-ray purchase?Yes it is!",Wrath of the Titans
118,xtian_durden,Let Thy Wrath Be Mine!,5,10 August 2012,"""Wrath"" made no improvement from the first movie's futile effort to retell the story of the Greek mythology. I'm ashamed for veteran actors Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson for participating in another Hollywood fantasy gimmick, but they played their part well, though a better director should've been involved, I still can remember them together in a masterful film, Schindler's List. It might be grand for its target audience, but for people who can recognize the difference between a bad movie and a good one would get bored with it. It's too soon and too short, just like the first movie. Persues (Sam Worthington) the demi-god and the main character, to play out the plot of the movie, he follows orders from other characters and also gives orders to them too, they follow it with some difficulty (perhaps to extend the movie and to give the audience the entertainment they're after for), and when it's done, it's done, the movie is over.

120,Parks,What did you expect?,6,22 December 2012,"It's a sequel to a remake of a cheesy 80's sword and sandal adventure movie. We were never talking ""classic"" here.What we are talking are decent special effects, lots of action, a cliché- heavy script, some fairly wooden performances and a Greek demi-god with an Aussie accent like Yahoo Serious. The plot is one of those dumb, ""we have to get to the place to assemble the thing that can kill the monster"" type stories. You can fill in the blanks yourself - the writers sure did.It's actually pretty good fun. I'd rank it alongside the lesser Marvels like Fantastic Four or Thor and certainly way better than Harry Hamlin's original.",Wrath of the Titans
121,zterrell,All action...I think??,3,2 April 2012,"For characterization this should get 0 stars. For camera work, it should get dumped in the trash can. For action and fight scenes... from what the normal eye can see, it is endless battles that are mostly wasted celluloid because the camera never stops to focus on the action. I think we should take all of the idiots, who thought a shaky camera was somehow an improvement of 80 years of excellent work by film directors, and draft them into becoming mine sweepers for our troops...using real brooms!I dragged my wife to this saying it couldn't be as bad as it sounded, because we actually enjoyed the first Clash of the Titans. Now she won't trust me to pick our next movie. In a word the film was boring. The writer must have thought Sam Worthington was John Wayne and this was his last picture, so everyone would love him without any reason whatsoever. He has a son...except there is no real bonding. Oh, and he and the Queen...well, it's understood they are an item. No need for romance or bonding there. And the show makes a statement about fathers and sons...but not one that makes much sense. So if you love mindless actions with closeup unwatchable action, with lots of explosions and an occasional glimpse of a creature, this is for you.Finally, the cyclops were quite well done, but not worth the price of admission.",Wrath of the Titans
122,CinemaCocoa,"Just ninety minutes of massive CGI monsters and ""epic"" battles.",6,4 May 2012,"The old gods, Zeus and Hades find their powers and influence waning as mortals cease their prayers, and in a desperate act Hades opens the Underworld prison of Tartarus, freeing the titans and their ancient father Kronos. Now every immortal and demigod must choose a side, and Perseus must fight for the mortal life he chose. All this talk of titans being released might remind you of last years Immortals, and there are plenty of similarities (except for Mikey Rourke in a silly hat) only Wrath feels slightly more in keeping with the mythology. Slightly. I was a little saddened how the titans themselves were still underdeveloped or non-existent, the promotional images for Wrath suggested more diversity between them, yet most focus was given to the colossal Kronos battle. Cinematography used that irritating shaky camera once more, making the Minotaur fight a particularly lukewarm experience! The story's surprise focus on Perseus' brother Ares, yes, the God of War, was gratifying and hammered home (no pun intended) the concept of mortal prayers empowering and weakening certain gods. It almost felt like there was underlying subtext at this point!I could have used twenty minutes more though, to solidify some of the characters further and make it less like one long action sequence.

A lot of the fight scenes could have been treated with slow motion for example the movie ""300"" combined a lot of slow and fast motion fight sequences.

126,amahlanand,Titanic Failure,3,9 May 2012,"Most mythology with a modern twist, particularly if it adheres to formula, just does not work in cinema and 'Wrath of the Titans' is proof as to why. Older films drawing influence from ancient times have at least seemed more in tune with the world 'ancient', devoid of flash CGI and special effects, rather choosing to drive the film through contextual acting and reasonable story telling. 'Wrath of the Titans' unfortunately does the exact opposite. It contained uninspired, somewhat overdone acting despite boasting some of the best actors in the business as well as drab, cringeworthy dialogue, both of which plagued the film being more overbearing than contextual and appropriate. The visuals shone at times, the special effects had a 'wow' factor at other times, but the disjointed plot was the shortfall which truly ruined the production from being a mythological spectacle to a hastily constructed mish mash which borrowed bits and pieces from mythology without truly embodying it. At times, you are kept enthralled by the prospect of an exciting adventure only for each juncture to end anticlimactically eventually resulting in the film's rushed resolution. Ultimately, you realise that you would rather watch the older movies with people dressed in Minotaur and Cyclops costumes than see laughable renditions of these mythological creatures through special effects, particularly if the plot is woven properly and the acting stands out.Somehow, gods dying just does not seem to strike a chord. How and why remained one of many plausible questions left begging.",Wrath of the Titans

I thought it was a fun movie to watch. I saw it with my friend, and we both found it enjoyable. But the sequel, Wrath of the Titans, is definitely an improvement over it's predecessor.Wrath of the Titans starts off a few years after Clash of the Titans. Perseus has decided to live like a normal human, and he's got himself a son. But when he finds out that Zeus, his father, and all the other gods are becoming mortal and weak because the humans have lost their faith in them, he literally goes to hell to put things back into place.Just like the previous film, the story is crap and just an excuse to have some epic battles shoved in. The battles were cool, the characters were likable and the special effects were brilliant.Now one of the coolest things about Wrath of the Titans is the 3D, and how it's handled. Things pop out at you, you go through tight corners while you feel like you're really there. There's one shot were I literally jumped because something just literally came out of the screen.Overall, Wrath of the Titans is a good movie to watch, and it's entertaining to watch in 3D.",Wrath of the Titans
128,zenjunkie,"Messy, Messy, Messy...",1,31 July 2013,"What the hell were they thinking of? This film makes 'Clash' look good. Visually, I must say the film is very good - most of the time, although somewhat over the top. BUT... The dialogue is crap. The scripting is abysmal. The actual mythology was all over the place. The writers should NEVER be allowed to script a movie again and be made to work at McDonald's at minimum wage. The characterisation was all over the place, you couldn't care less about any of them. Sam Worthington was way too Aussie. Liam Neeson was just going through the numbers. So for that matter was Ralph Fiennes. Rosamund Pike was emotionless. Cold as a fish. Bill Nighy was, well Bill Nighy - with a very northern accent for some reason. What's with the regional accents? Very mythological indeed! The movie would have worked better with more care given to the dialogue, less modern phrases and treated a bit more classically. I almost expected a rap song to play through the end titles. So, if you want an adventure movie this might work for you. If you want something with a bit of intelligence - give it a miss.",Wrath of the Titans
129,FFman-847-460126,"Great Visuals, Bad Script",5,31 March 2012,"Epic movies have been around for several years now. Simply throwing action and graphics at a movie can no longer make it great. Epics have been pulled down to the level of an average movie. We must care about the characters. The dialogue must be worthwhile. The storyline cannot be linear and bland. Wrath of the Titans, although enjoyable, did not get the memo.Wrath of the Titans follows a linear storyline. Any person who has any knowledge of Greek mythology with grow bored of the overused story of the labyrinth, Kronos, and how being part human makes you stronger than a God. The storyline has absolutely no originality. It's almost like the screenwriter read Percy Jackson and the Olympians and decided to turn the series into a more adult movie.Luckily, there are several aspects that save Wrath of the Titans from being horrible. For one, the dialog worked. Mix that with the fantastic graphics and you have a movie that you can sit back and enjoy— so long as you don't think too much. At the heart, the original Greek mythology about Gods overthrowing Titians is quite intriguing. It's just been done far too oftenI must note that this movie should have been longer. The opening was far too short. You barely see the town in which Perseus and his son live before it gets ripped apart. With no buildup, it is impossible to care for the characters. This makes the movie little more than Greek Myth brought to life with no depth. It is truly unfortunate. A movie like this has so much potential. It was all wasted with a horrible screenwriter.If you like Greek Mythology or enjoyed Clash of the Titans, this is a movie you might want to see. If that is not the case, it's not something you will want to see in theatres (or at all). There have been much better action/adventure movies so far this year—The Grey and Chronicle are two. Wrath of the Titians is a movie with potential. Unfortunately, the makers of the movie forgot to turn that potential into gold.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",Wrath of the Titans
130,kdorsey321,Wrath incomplete,6,19 April 2012,"This movie review is on the movie: ""Wrath of The Titans,"" starring Sam Worthington(Perseus), Liam Neeson(Zeus), and Ralph Fiennes(Hades). This movie came out on March 30, 2012. I actually was able to watch this movie in the movie theater. When I saw the previews to this movie I was a little skeptical. I was skeptical because the first movie of its kind (""Clash of The Titans 2010"") also looked great when it came to the previews, but it ended up being a little disappointing (my opinion). The previews to ""Wrath of The Titans"" look great! Despite my doubts due to the first of it kind, I still decided to give this movie a honest fair shot to be great and rated fairly.To my misfortune, this movie ended up basically giving me the same feeling the first of its kind gave me. This movie was a little confusing to me. I thought they could have done a better job of clearing up what was going on in the movie. At times I wasn't even sure who Perseus was fighting. I'm not a genius, but this movie shouldn't have been to complicated for me to figure out. There were times were I just wasn't sure what exactly was going on. I also felt like the story/plot could have been better. After I read the description of the movie, I was finally able to piece everything together. I felt like I shouldn't have had to do that to know what was going on in this type of movie. Usually, when there is a second coming of a movie that involves action like this series, there is more action in the second movie. I look for that. I felt as though the action level was pretty much on the same level as the first movie (Clash of The Titans). I wanted more action. When that big lava creature came out at the climax of the movie, I was just praying it wasn't going to go down as easy as the ""Kraken"" did. My prayers was answered....but only just a little. This big lava creature lasted about five seconds longer than the Kraken. What's the point of having a creature that huge if its not going to last long?? I also thought the acting was average at best. This movie was a subpar action/fantasy movie all the way around to me.There were some things that I did like about the movie. I thought some of the action scene that we received wasn't too bad. I really like the creatures in the film. I thought the creatures were pretty cool! The big one eyed monster that was in the forest was interesting to look at and two headed beast seemed like a creative monster to be induced in the movie series. The two head monster (Chrimera) had a horn on one of its heads, wings, and an incredibly long, for no reason tail and it was cool! Overall, I'm not going to say it was the most horrible action/fantasy movie I've seen, but wasn't good enough to get pass a 6 on my radar. I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10. I wouldn't see this movie in the movie theater. Its still in the movie theater and I'm telling you not to see it! I wouldn't buy this on DVD unless you are a huge fan of the series. I would say its worth a shot to see this when it comes out on Netflix if you have Netflix. If you have Netflix, wait for it to come out on Netflix. If you don't have it on Netflix and your really curious to see for yourself if it was good or not, wait for it to come out on Redbox for a dollar.",Wrath of the Titans

The CGI is stunning, and though I am not a big fan of 3D, it is very well done from start to finish. SPOILER ALERT!! Well...... sort of. This is loosely based on the Greek Mythology about Zeus and his father. My issue is the lack of female characters in this movie particularly Hera. Any movie that is based on literature, to me, should be as accurate as possible. So, if your knowledgeable about Greek Mythology, you'll be scratching your head at the choice of characters in this movie,the casting, and the storyline.

132,TheXeroXone,Too many clichés taken from too many better sources,5,18 May 2012,"The powers of the gods are dwindling and the gods are slowly fading into oblivion. Monsters are being raised from wherever. Buildings are sliding all around the place. And there is no reason to care about ANY of it. Ares and Hades are villains just as we've seen in nearly EVERY Greek mythology based storyline. I just want to pound my head against the wall every time I see this cinematic flatulence.The love interest from the first movie is gone and instead of recasting the part, they just kill off the character. Bobo the Owl makes another cameo in this movie, playing the role of Wilson the Volleyball from Castaway. The blue ents are gone... I guess the action figures must not have sold that well.When the Titan emerges (and it is the ONLY titan in the movie), he looks like the lava Titan from Disney's Hercules. The Titan shouts a lot, but hell if I could ever understand a word he said.At least Perseus doesn't look like he came from the Jarhead Clan anymore. But he is still an idiot. Zeus comes to him in the beginning of the story to tell him that the world is coming to an end and he needs his help. Perseus refuses because... get this... he refuses to leave his son. Apparently despite having god blood in his veins he is still unable to think far enough in advance to realize that if the world comes to an end, he'll be leaving his son permanently.The roles of Hades, Zeus and Hephaestus were really good, but three good performances just could not save this turkey from its bad writing and a dreadfully boring plot riddled with clichés.",Wrath of the Titans

134,paperback_wizard,"All Plot, No Characters",7,4 April 2012,"Now, I actually liked the remake of Clash of the Titans better than the original, as I've written before. Though the plots were very similar, I felt the characters had better development and motivation in the remake. Unfortunately, Wrath of the Titans takes a step backwards in that regard.Take Perseus, played again by Sam Worthington. In the 1981 Clash, he was sort of a generic hero who sort of generically decided to save the world and marry Princess Andromeda. In the remake, he's given actual motivation for his actions. He's a half-man, half-god whose adopted human family was just killed and blames the gods for their deaths, and must reconcile his divine heritage with his desire to live as a man. Whatever you may think of Worthington's performance in the remade Clash, the effort was certainly made to give some depth to his character.In Wrath, however, he sort of falls back into his generic role as the ""demi-god hero"". Not for lack of trying, mind you. They do give him a son and a half-brother (Ares, played by Édgar Ramírez), but neither they nor he spend much time on screen developing themselves past their surface traits. That's a shame, too, because Ares, the God of War, could have been such an impressive character, especially since he betrays his father Zeus (Liam Neeson) to the Titan Kronos. Instead, the God of War comes across as more than a little ... whiny as he berates Zeus for being a bad father to him. The rivalry between Ares and Perseus is never really explored, but you can't imagine there being much to explore given that Ares actually lives with Zeus on Mount Olympus and Perseus lives as a human with his son and didn't even like Zeus all that much in the last movie. Why does Perseus seem so devoted to his father now? Why does Ares seem to think Zeus has grown so close to his half-human son? Those are two questions the movie never even tried to answer, but should have.Next on the list of underdeveloped (and underutilized) characters is the demi-god Agenor (played by Toby Kebbell), the son of Poseidon (Danny Huston). We first meet Agenor in an Argos prison. Apparently, he's something of a master conman/thief/liar, but his father, the God of the Sea, trusts him and sends Perseus to enlist him in the fight between Olympians and Titans. Agenor could, potentially, have been the most interesting character in the movie, as charming rogues with hearts of gold have a tendency to be. However, we're not given much of his backstory, which leaves us with the vague clichéd assumption that his father abandoned him, he turned to a life of crime and cons to survive, and the news of his father's death has shaken him so that he's decided to give being a good guy (for a price) another shot. To be fair, hearing that a god has died would make anyone stop and think; and it gives us one of the better exchanges in the movie: Agenor: Gods don't die.Perseus: They do now.You see, it's not that this is a bad movie. The dialogue, for the most part, is actually pretty good. The plot, while it's more akin to epic fantasy than traditional Greek myths, is an interesting one. And the settings and special effects are, quite frankly, spectacular. The labyrinth that leads into Tartarus, where Zeus is being slowly drained of his life force so that Kronos can be freed of his prison, is an incredible shifting stone maze. The creature effects, especially the Chimera and the Makhai, are stunning and even fairly realistic. But the movie revolves entirely around the plot, which is a fairly basic one and even mirrors the plot of the 2010 movie. The characters are just going through the motions, like a puppet show with really good visuals. I understand that, at nearly two hours in length, it could hardly take more time for character development, but there are ways they could have gotten around that.I'd recommend this movie, personally. It's exhilarating, and at times quite hilarious. For all that it has very little character development (and only one Titan), it's still a good movie.(This review originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/ )",Wrath of the Titans
135,Pycs,Why God? Why?,1,30 March 2012,"'Clash of the Titans,' which graced silver screen in April of 2010, was reviled by critics and fans of the 1981 original a-like. The script was a mess and the converted 3-D looked, well, converted. It'd only make sense that such a travesty was met with poor results at the box office?Nope. 'Clash' was one of the highest grossing movies of 2010 and, inevitably, launched a sequel in the hopes of duping a few more simple minded people into making a buck.Now, to clear things up, I had not seen the 2010 version, and don't plan on it based on what I've heard. So I went into this sequel without much of a back story. This shouldn't ruin my movie-going experience, as I had seen movies like 'Terminator 2' and 'Aliens' without viewing the originals beforehand.The story was a mess. Plot elements didn't add up or happened too conveniently. Characters traveled places that weren't well explained (sometimes barely at all) and I was often left scratching my head, wondering where they were or how they got there. Most of the plot points that I felt perplexed on, I figured it was because I hadn't seen the first film. But these moments kept repeating while I was watching it, until I finally gave up all thought of making sense of the story.Nothing irritates me more than clichés piling up and, oh boy, did this movie have it's share. Perseus (a dull Sam Worthington, which is a nearly a cliché in its own right) has left his heroic days behind and become a fishermen in a local village. Of course, just like every other story ever written, the would-be pacifist is called back into arms for the greater good. And, what's that? There's a child as well! His son! How convenient! But I doubt they'll us him in the climatic fight, as a emotional weakness for the bad guy to exploit. That would never happen! Oh, and the over-the-top hostile, misunderstood criminal at the beginning story is magical transformed into a hero by the end. How creative! The more I think about this movie, the more my anger swells inside me, like a hurricane of hatred being forged in the deep depths of the ocean, ready to explode into a fury of rage and destruction over all in it's path. So, I'll leave it as this, if you somehow (and I use that term very lightl) enjoyed the 2010 'Clash of the Titans,' you might want to check this turd out. Other than that, don't waste your time or money on this pile of junk.",Wrath of the Titans

And the film pulled a miracle, for me at least: it held my attention, made me chuckle a couple of times, and I liked it. The only excuse I have: the film didn't let me down like the first. The one thing I kept telling myself: please don't let me down, and what do you know? It didn't.

The plot is atrocious, based around father-son relationships and tired conspiracies amongst the Gods. Sam Worthington mumbles his way through terrible dialogue that none of the cast can bring alive. Agenor, played by Toby Kebbell is intended to bring some comic relief but fails to do so. The only humour comes from John Bell's (Helius) unintentionally hilarious facial expressions, his 'scared look' had audience members laughing out loud. Veteran actor Bill Nighy plays Hephaestus with a Yorkshire accent for some reason, and is the best character only because he resembles something out of Monty Python. The Gods were the best things in the first film, their bickering was well performed and an interesting plot element. Here they loose all that appeal coming across as one dimensional caricatures.

140,arginnon,It's not that bad.,5,4 May 2012,"One other thing changed along with the hair of our beloved demigod, Perseus, and that is the composer. Clash of the Titans had a godly soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi, but Wrath, instead of the heavenly horns and ""vunderful"" violins of the Olympus, utilized the gruesome guitars and killer keyboards of the Tartarus, making a barely bearable background noise for the fight scenes. A film score needs to stand on its own! It's awesome if it can support the scenes in the film, that's what the primary function is, but if no-one wants to listen to it after watching the movie, then it's no good. Just take Star Wars for example.Clash had a great track by Ramin Djawadi. It had everything: heroic themes, suspense, action and emotions. The filmmakers should've just re-used the score of the first film, if not re- hiring Djawadi. I even found myself playing the old soundtrack in my head over the constant pumping of the beat and it would've worked so much better. Anyway, the movie was fun. Nothing much, entertaining, action packed and a great spectacle. The story and the script weren't very strong, though I didn't expect them to be any good. I saw Clash of the Titans, ya know.The best thing in Wrath of the Titans didn't last long. I'm talking about Bill Nighy. Him as Hephaistos and the way he performed his role was a delight. Nighy is one amazing actor, godly in every bit (especially in this particular picture), with his entertaining acting and that distinctive way of speech. It was just kinda sad he didn't have bigger role in this movie.I might be one in a million, but I liked Clash too and I gotta say, in some aspects, Wrath was even better.

I didn't want it to be because I enjoyed Clash of the Titans and thought the sequel, though unneeded, could be interesting.This was a pretty weak movie. The editing is pretty horrible as it jumps from one scene with one group of characters with no segue and then jumps back in only to show us that they are somewhere else in their conversation (or in some cases, another place). The dialogue was horrendous and full of every cliché word in the book. The action scenes were short and oddly placed.The worst part was Andromeda. In my opinion, Andromeda served her purpose in the first movie. To bring her back as a warrior princess who yells commands was embarrassing to watch. I couldn't take Rosamund Pike seriously in the role as she tried too hard to be both tough as a leader but soft enough to be Perseus's love interest - something Gemma Arteton did effortlessly as Io.All in all, it was a typical sequel that tried to outdo the first (which was a remake to boot) and failed. It goes in the category of: forgotten sequels.Not even Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes could save it. In fact, their story lines were the most confusing to me.

Persius goes through a lot in the story only to have Zeus die on him anyway right that is a kick in the sack big time. Other than that the film romped the first one in terms of story and style. The main antagonist lasted at least more than a minute this time round and it was a far more elaborate battle scene. The visual effects were mind-blowing and done with such profession for that I commend you guys very good job.

Terrible terrible script, and possibly the most tedious film i have seen in ages. I have avoided transformers after the first as i guessed they would be just as tedious. Seriously how many battles do you need to see against a seemingly impossible foe to then get defeated by the most stupid means until you fall asleep. Every foe is like an end of level bad guy in old school computer games but at least you could decide to just die and end it all by your own actions, whereas here you are dragged through a hundred more pointless fights that all end the same way.....Terrible abuse of a great great story, albeit not anything like what ever written and there is good reason for that. How the hell did this even get on film? Well obviously as its another mindless director and producer backed by financial big shots that don't care one bit for film but see this as another way to pocket millions.Seriously one of the worst films i have seen and shame on them all. tripe",Wrath of the Titans

The script is dreadfully boring, stakes are not really established and there is no emotional pull .. the relationship between the three generations of men is not explored anywhere near enough. Also, like a lot of these films, it's completely devoid of any fun or humour, which is a shame.No doubt a nice little earner for all involved. But please, please don't make another one, or if you do, have the good grace to call it ""Cash of the Titans"".Lastly, I'm Australian, and I can barely understand a word of Sam Worthington's dialogue.

148,antoniomagallon90,The Gods are unhappy with this film. One of the Worst Films of 2012,1,17 April 2012,"Wrath of the Titan takes place ten years after the first film. Perseus (Sam Worthington), who is a demigod, now lives as a fisherman again. He now has a son name Heleus (John Bell). One night Perseus father Zeus (Liam Neeson) visits and informs him that the gods are losing power because people are no longer praying. He asks for help, but Perseus refuses. Afterwards, Zeus travels to Tartarus to meet with his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Edgar Ramirez). Zeus tells Hades that he must forgive the past and must rebuild Tartarus, but he instead attacks his own brothers and Ares betrays Zeus. Perseus hears his voice and must save his father again and save the world again. Where do I begin this review? When I originally reviewed the remake version in 2010, I gave it a C-. Two years later, Warner Bros. release the sequel and I have to say that this version is a lot worse than the remake. There were couple of things that were going through my head. One is that why would these good actors: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes, signed on to make the sequel. When first hearing that the sequels was on development, my immediate thoughts that it was a bad idea and I was right. Since there's lack of character development, why should I care about them? Some even had lack of screen time, which we hardly got to know them. The plot was poorly executed. None of it makes any sense whatsoever. For example, if they were gods, then why didn't Zeus regenerate himself (keep in mind they're immortal) or save himself? For crying out loud he is a god and he must have the ability to do that. Although I am glad that the ""mechanical owl"" from the original 1981 classic makes a cameo, but it was still not enough to save the movie. At times the dialog was laughable because of how poorly written it was. If I was one of those actors and read the scrip, I probably would have thrown it away. My favorite line was when Hades gives half of his powers to Zeus and said, ""Brother, you look 10,000 years younger."" When hearing this I wanted to laugh really hard. None of the action scenes didn't matter because it doesn't deliver intensity and moments as they're suppose to. Like its predecessor, the film was converted in 3D. Although it isn't as blurry and poorly developed as the previous, it still lacks of depth and feed to it. The problem with 3D conversion is that it doesn't feel the same way as shooting in 3D. The only successful way to achieve 3D experience is to shoot it right. Wrath of the Titans neither has that. The only good thing about the film is that special effects weren't amazing as oppose to other films, but there still good. I kept telling myself ""When is it going to end? When is it going to end? When is it going to end?"" and my wish came true. Wrath of the Titans is one of the worst films of 2012. The only way I would enjoy the movie is if Kratos (from God of War video game series that deals with Greek mythology) was to kill everybody and the movie ends. Looks like the gods are going to hate this movie as much as I did.",Wrath of the Titans
149,vladtopliceanu,A sequel which improves the series,7,1 July 2013,"They did it again! Although the action scenes were improved since its predecessor, they still confused me. Again I had a scene, where out of nowhere, I had no idea where the monsters came from. Last time it was scorpions, this time it's cyclops! There is an action scene where they are fighting a cyclops and a second later there are two of them! Fortunately, the action in this film, overall, has improved. This is probably due to the different type of directing provided by Jonathan Liebesman, which I have to mention is the director of The Killing Room, one of my all-time favorite movies. He decided to not play with the camera while actually filming this movie and it clearly brought a certain degree of clarity to the action.Unfortunately, I think that this film was worse from an acting point of view. First of all, I hate re-castings! So they replaced Alexa Davalos with Rosamund Pike as Andromeda and it didn't work for me. At first I thought they purposely replaced her because in this film Andromeda is more of a warrior than a helpless princess like in the other film, but actually she just dropped out because of scheduling conflict. I consider this to be a loss for the film. Second of all, in Clash of the Titans, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes commanded the screen not only when both of them shared a scene together, but individually too. This time around they didn't inspire me that much. They were great if compared to the quality of the film, especially with some touching moments, but overall nothing that spectacular as in the previous movie. Sam Worthington was, and I have to use this word again, as hollow as always. The stand-outs in this film are Bill Nighy as Hephaestus and maybe Edgar Ramirez as Ares.The script was again really uninspired. It made the film feel really chaotic and it was like it didn't know when they wanted to get from one moment of the movie to another. It almost felt like the movie was in an inexplicable rush, maybe due to the fact that this movie is actually shorter than Clash of the Titans. Also the really important action scenes felt really anti-climactic because of this ""rush"" of the film.I guess the reason this movie gets a higher rating than the previous is because of the interaction between characters. Although they could have made a couple of moments more awesome, but failed once again due to the lack of quality of the script, overall, they managed to make me feel something for the characters in some moments, and not just disdain. I should also mention that the production design was pretty nice and the visual effects were cool from time to time. All in all, a 7.",Wrath of the Titans

Perseus returns 10 years after defeating the Kraken raising his son after the death of the boys mother. A war between the Gods & The Titans rages on as the humans have lost faith in the gods resulting in all manner of horrors on Earth. When Zeus(Neeson) is taken and has his powers drained by Kronos, Perseus is thrust back into a battle to restore balance alongside Andromeda(Pike) & fellow demigod Argenor(Kebbell). It just comes across as very rushed & a desperate attempt to get people paying back in to the cinema & cash in on the 3D bonanza. This means the film suffers from little attention to plot or character depth. The effects again fail to really compensate for this and it leaves you feeling it was all a bit pointless & worried that there more of a similar level will follow.",Wrath of the Titans

152,micahbosarge,There's actually Titans in this film and they kick ass . (awsome!!!),7,29 March 2012,"First let me say that this is no 300 or Lord of the Rings epic as the multiple trailers would have you believe but it definitely surpasses the first one in every way. Plot,acting,action,F/X,and 3D are all what you should expect from a popcorn movie like this the only thing that would have made it more entertaining would be blood and gore added to all the hacking and slashing that goes on or at least more decapitations and dismemberment's but then the movie would have lost millions due to limited viewing .My review on the plot. (NO SPOILERS PRESENT) Many people including my-self complained about the paper thin plot clash of titans had so when I heard that Wrath of Titans was being directed by Jonathan Liebesman the directer of (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Beginning,and Battle:Los Angeles) I was skeptical that the plot was going to be any better because as good as Battle L.A was in the action,and F/X, the plot was almost as thin as Clash of Titans was but i,am happy to report the plot is a lot better in depth and they actually included Titans in the plot.My review of the acting. The acting is a lot better than the first manly because of the writing and the script and I think Sam Worthington in maturing as an actor and as a result he gives a fine performance rivaling avatar,the only one i had any problem with was Rosamund Pike her performance as Andromeda the worrier princes was a bit wooden and not very believable but the rest of the cast was at their very best.My review of the action and F/X. The action was top notch and non-stop and far better in every way than the first one the only thing missing was blood after the blows.The F/X was amazing nothing looked fake the creatures,the set pieces, every stick and stone, looked amazing perfect eye-candy can't wait to see it on bluray.My review of the 3D. The 3D was applied in post production just like the first one so I was scared the the 3D was going to be a bust but to my surprise the 3D was good but no comparison to avatar or transformers 3 but all in all the 3D was good.It gave depth to the movie most of all in the action scenes when the cyclops popped on screen he literally popped out of the screen and that was amazing.All in all this is a perfect movie to kick back relax with a large popcorn in one hand and a large coke in the other with your feet prop up on the seat ahead of you unless occupied and forget your problems for 99 minutes and after the movie you will fill as you can conquer the gods so i give it a 7 out of 10",Wrath of the Titans
153,yamaguchi-victor,"Better than the first one, but don't expect anything extraordinary",5,31 March 2012,"Usually, the first film of a series is the best one. However, we have the opposite here. 'Wrath of the Titans'(the sequel) was much better than 'Clash of the Titans'(the first film) for several reasons.The first of them is the technical aspects. 'Wrath of the Titans' presents us thrilling action sequences that really involve the audience. Director Jonathan Liebesman used his camera in a similar way that he did in his last film Battle Los Angeles to make us feel part of the action – actually, pretty close of it. Sometimes his camera shakes and shows a wide view of what is happening in a particular scene – like the final battle when 'Cronos' is coming out of the underworld and everything explodes (just fantastic!) Unfortunately, I didn't see it in IMAX, but it must be a visually stunning experience.The other aspect is the plot. In the first film, the writers seemed to want us to take the story too serious – in fact with such a silly plot, it was almost impossible. Wrath of the Titans has a much more pleasant story with some humorous parts – just one or two, but it really breaks the ice. Also, we feel that it was written for pure entertainment.However, just the fact that it is better than the first one doesn't make it spectacular. We still have the same silly plot – which can be told in a couple of lines – and an unconvincing performance by Sam Worthington who just doesn't look like a semi god. The role need much stronger not only in physical appearance but in personality too (Henry Cavill, who has recently done Theseus in 'Immortals' would be much better for this kind of role).Between these pros and cons, we have a film aimed purely for those who want an enjoyable time with friends or boyfriend/girlfriend. Not the biggest hit of the moment – but not as bad as expected.",Wrath of the Titans
154,rachel-673-19946,"Oh, dear.",3,27 April 2012,"There is much that could be said here about the egregious scholarly inaccuracies with which this movie abounds. Admittedly, mythologies are, almost by definition, very, very old, and the Ancient Greek myths on which our story is somewhat based exist in many different forms, coming to us through the millennia from only a few surviving sources, all of which are inherently unreliable and invariably contradictory. Also, we're dealing with matters of lowercase-g gods here, actual personifications of nature use their great powers not for any grand purpose but merely to enhance their own prestige—and though Science Fiction has long speculated that the old pantheons may actually be based on some form of advanced life, be it alien or otherwise, there is not even a scrap of evidence to suggest that this might be the case in the realm of science fact. Therefore, to be caviling at this film for its flagrant abuses of known, though ever-speculative, legend is probably taking even my mythology-geek nitpickery a little too far.Instead, let me tell you why it's a terrible film, all of that aside.Just before viewing this in IMAX 3D I sat down to watch the 2010 CLASH OF THE TITANS, thereby making for myself one of the most dissatisfying movie double-bills of all time. So, having concluded the largely forgettable earlier effort mere minutes before commencing the latest installment, I was in a good position to compare and contrast the two movies, and before long I had to wonder: had anyone who worked on WRATH done the same thing? Because in the continuity stakes, nothing here makes any sense. None.You may recall from the first movie – though I hope, for your sake, that you don't – our hero, Perseus (Sam Worthington), son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and unwitting champion of Princess Andromeda of Argos (Alexa Davros), is forced to go head-to-head with a fearsome beast called the Kraken in order to save the city, and the woman, from the consequences of human hubris. You see, the Argosians had decided that the gods did not exist, nor deserve their worship, which has to strike one as pretty stupid in a world in which capricious beings who can control the weather and such will often show up in person to prove their cruel divinity. Zeus, outraged, allowed his resentful brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to go and put the fear of the gods into the people and bring them back to the fold. Perseus, meanwhile, goes on a quest, defeats assorted monsters, and along the way falls in love with the slightly-creepy Io (Gemma Aterton), who is surpassingly beautiful, brave and wise, but who is semi-immortal and has basically been stalking him since he was an infant – and who, we learn in WRATH, died after having his baby, presumably to a) make way for a new love interest and b) showcase the good sense of Gemma Aterton in not signing on for this film.So now Perseus and kid are merrily living the life of humble fishermen when Zeus arrives and asks for his help. At some point between the last movie and this one, Perseus has become Zeus's favorite son (as opposed to someone he was prepared to kill with a Kraken; yeah, thanks, Dad), and now people everywhere have stopped believing in the gods, which means that the world is beginning to unravel. In particular, Tartarus, the prison to which Cronus and the other Titans were exiled after being overthrown by the Olympians, is growing weak, soon to allow monsters to roam the world. Turns out, of course, that Hades is helping this along, as is Ares (Édgar Ramírez), God of War, who has major Daddy Issues and a big problem with Sibling Rivalry. So, to recap: new gods losing power, old gods getting more power, humanity in crisis, and only one man can save us. He, unsurprisingly, does—with a little help from his godly family. Also, he learns to love again. The End.Now, it could well be that there is a deeper truth to be found in here, among the over-the-top CGI, bombastic score, direful dialogue and incessant over-acting. Something about self-determination, and how the only gods that exist are those we create, or how our Creator is prepared to die for us – there really is a little something in here for everyone, whether atheist or devout, if you're prepared to search hard enough. The question is: are you? And if so, why? I mean, I am as inclined toward over-analysis of film as the next person, but any search for true meaning in either of these wretched TITANS movies is fruitless, and I intend to stop it right now.Essentially? This movie, as little as I expected of it, delivered even less. If it weren't for the 3D, which really is very well done (unlike its predecessor's, which has become a byword for bad post-conversion), I would count this the biggest waste of my time since well, since I saw CLASH OF THE TITANS. I will say, however, that at the very least I got a few moments of amusement out of Bill Nighy as Hephaestus, broad Yorkshire accent and all. In fact, it is in the variety of accents evident in this film that I find perhaps my only overall positive comment. Australian, Irish, several varieties from across England, plus Spanish, Italian (Poseidon, it seems) and sundry forms of American. The reason I like this is because the characters would doubtless be speaking Ancient Greek here, and so why should it matter what form their audience-friendly English takes?Yes, that is the only thing I unreservedly liked about this film. A pretty sad indictment, isn't it?– This review first appeared in Geek Speak Magazine",Wrath of the Titans

Maybe it's because it was the first movie of it's kind that I'd ever seen. (Don't judge me lol). The Clash of the Titans kept me guessing. The Wrath of the Titans was more predictable and the graphics weren't really amazing. There was one fight scene that looked absolutely fake, the same goes for when they showed the lightening bolt.

156,MidnightMax,Wrath of The Titans= new levels of ineptitude...,4,1 April 2012,"At the Theater - ""Wrath of The Titans' - Every lame idea that didn't make it into 2010's ""Clash of The Titans"" was apparently spliced hastily together in this poorly conceived, annoyingly bombastic mess of a follow up. I didn't care for ""Clash"" much at all, but anyone who tells you that ""Wrath"" is an improvement is smoking some serious dust. I have it in a three way tie with 2012's cinematic dregs ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" and ""The Grey"" as worst films of the year.Forget coherency, structure and reasoning; there's very little of that to be found here at all. Trying to make sense of the on screen happenings is futile. It's a movie that was assembled without a discernible plot, seemingly making itself up as it goes along only to be later edited by a drunk monkey. Characterization is at a minimum, some characters coming into frame with little or no introduction whatsoever- you'll find yourself wondering ""Who the hell is that and where did they come from?"" quite often. Certain stretches of dialogue were apparently so bad that the filmmakers just drowned it out with thunderous original music or sound effects. The effects work is serviceable, though nothing really groundbreaking- an early showdown with a Chimera and the climactic arrival of ""Kronos"" would be amongst the few FX highlights. There's a scene involving a Minotaur which seems tacked on as an afterthought and reeks of ineptitude.Sam Worthington is more self aware here than in the first installment- he's at least trying. Rosamund Pike is cast as the obligatory eye candy, though I must say that I found myself missing Gemma Arterton quite a bit. Ralph Feinnes, Liam Neeson and Danny Huston return from the first film and put in small amounts of solid acting work, it's a shame to see them wasted in this way, though. Bill Nighy (in a brief appearance) and Toby Kebbell (""War Horse"", ""Rock N Rolla"") steal their limited amount of screen-time. Edgar Ramirez (IFC's Miniseries ""Carlos"") plays the central villain here and only conveys a minimal amount of presence.The film is 99 minutes long and I can only remember about 5 minutes of that being worthwhile. Needless to say, skip this mutha! 4.0 out of 10",Wrath of the Titans
157,primevalsoup,Standard stuff. Not as good as Clash,6,31 March 2012,"I think I represent a minority of people who thought Clash of the Titans was amazing, profound, incredibly exciting and had great graphics. Hopefully less people dispute the soundtrack to Clash, which was absolutely fantastic thanks to Ramin Djawadi.This film feels put together just to rake in sales from people like me who loved the first one, or people who probably didn't get out of the first one what I got out of it. Perhaps the studio, which perhaps (I like to think) saw some of what I saw in Clash realised that the market share I belong to was tiny (just me?) and that the market wanting to see big monsters fight Sam Worthington was worth investing in.Story: It's alright. Not as upbeat as Clash. A bit depressing. I'm sure there were more gods in Clash than Wrath, so not sure where the others went. The romance was... who's idea was that??? Done rather awfully. And I'm not spoiling anything to declare that Io (Gemma Aterton) wasn't in it, but why? She was good. Because she didn't sign a contract? Maybe she didn't like the script. And for anyone out there who got something special from Clash (this whole rejection of patrons/gods/gifts for some dubious moral principle, despite going up against ridiculous odds) - you probably won't find it here.Action: I recall Clash being well choreographed. Many action films rely on blurred/fast/over close up shots to give the impression of action and violence. At the other end is very slowed down fighting. My preferred (which I recall there being a lot of in clash) is fast paced, real time and followable action. I suspect this is a nightmare to direct, which is why it happens so infrequently in films. Matrix did it - and was amazing. Anyway, this film goes for close up and can't see what's going on action quite a lot, which is a waste of talent/resources (cool monsters) and money and doesn't look good. Maybe I should change careers and become a choreographer. They ought to be raking it in.Graphics: Fine. I preferred the monsters from Clash though. And what there was was often too close to see/appreciate properly.Music: Fine - but not special. Not like Clash. Clash music was AMAZING. I bought it and listened to it a million times and infiltrated it into most of my itunes playlists. This was what you'd expect for a high budget film of this sort when they had nothing left for anyone great, but not memorable or inspiring (I've forgotten it already).Acting: I'm not an acting critic. No one annoyed me. Sam Worthington was unashamedly Australian and I was fine with that. So perhaps they got another $25 million to spend, but maybe with inflation this was an equivalent budget? I guess someone decided to change the director and the music composer - why? Sounds like Leterrier was keen, at least from wikipedia. Changing directors might explain aspects of the plot - new male lion arrives and starts killing off what was done by the one before him.",Wrath of the Titans
158,hollo-peter,Zeus would throw the makers into Tartarus,4,1 April 2012,"There was no problem with the remake. Hell, after seeing the CGI Medusa and the Kraken I wouldn't watch the original. Changes were made here and there but overall the film was OK.There comes the sequel. More monsters, more CGI, more battles, and more Liam Neeson / Ralph Fiennes. More acting? No, scratch that out. New plot? Well, some places and names were borrowed from Greek mythology but this is the most the film can offer.The bad guy this time is Cronus who appears to be a giant lava golem capable of unleashing a lot of creatures to punish mankind. I wonder why it is necessary, after all, it's all about the gods arguing with each other as to which part of the world to rule. Perseus, now a father, is once again contacted by Zeus who warns him of the coming danger. We already know he'll reject but he'll be involved, eventually. It's a shame to see how these wonderful actors depend on money - why else would they have accepted their roles? Neeson, Fiennes and Worthington are joined by Danny Huston, Rosamund Pike and Bill Nighy. Shame, shame, shame. Avoid it if you can - stick to the original or to the remake (but consider the latter a casual one, too).",Wrath of the Titans
159,Thatguywiththeface,Crash of the Titans,1,4 September 2012,"This is what you get when you let bad writers, write a bad screenplay, for a sequel to a good movie, and put it in the hands of a bad director. All the good actors and special effects in the world can't save it. There's a lot I'd like to say about this, but, ah heck, there's not enough story to ruin. Here goes.One thing I liked was they brought the equivalent of Burgess Meredith's character into this one, played awesomely by Bill Nighy, but that sadly doesn't save the rest of this mess. For the rest, they go right back to the formula that bugged me in the original, (and that I liked that they did away with for the remake) a bunch of random events that kind of mix into a main story at some point.Opening scene, they take away the wife Perseus had at the end of the first one. They also make his motivation not that he doesn't want to be a god, or not have anything to do with the gods, but now it's that he thinks he's too human to be a god... So basically, EVERYTHING the first one does, this one turns on it's head. Basically, this should've just been its own movie, it was 100% pointless to make this a sequel. Something that really bugged me was, why not keep Perseus awesome sword from Zeus and shield from the scorpion in this one? Who would get rid of such great weapons? Aries is treated like a god even though he is only a half god like Perseus, which just makes no sense. In this one, they put the princess back into the action like in the original, which actually makes sense for this one and would be cool, if she ever actually did ANYTHING. The love interest is non-existent through the movie and then jumps out of nowhere in the last 3 minutes of the film. Where the first one had a lot of great characters and motivation in the team, and really felt like a buddy journey film, this one was just a bunch of red shirts that die off fairly quickly and are very forgettable anyway. The titans were very underwhelming, even boring. The only cool one was the first one that was on EVERY commercial and billboard. The last ""Titan"" moved so darn slow that I have no idea why they even had to hold it back, it would take the thing a freakin year just to move a mile. Then we get to the gods. They introduce weapons that are super important, yet were never even seen in the first one. Maybe a line or two of dialog as to why they didn't use them in the first one? They only use them on other gods? ANY bad excuse would've done! Also in the first one, the gods had freaking AWESOME war armor even though they never fought. So why in this one, where they DO fight, did their armor look like it was designed by Arnie Grape? The hardest part of watching this movie is trying to figure out which is worse, the writing, or the directing. Sequels like this should just not be made.",Wrath of the Titans
160,wolverinejmc,"Oh dear, here comes the yawn.",5,3 April 2012,"Well darn, at least Clash of the titans, while cheesy to a fault, entertained me. It was two years ago, and I left a theater mildly entertained but ultimately let down by horrid 3d effects and an underwhelming lead man in Sam Worthington. fast forward two years and here we are again, with expensive special effects and a two dollar script. it's not that Wrath is horrible, but it does not improve upon it's predecessor in any way, which is it's final downfall. Worthington seems more comfortable in the role this time(I spy a smile!) but the script denies him any time to flesh Perseus out.In fact, the script let every actor down. Ares, portrayed by Edgar Ramirez, is hopelessly sullen and Fiennes' Hades has by far the worst lines in the film. Liam Neeson phones it in, with his beard doing most of the work. Also, Bill Nighy randomly shows up as Hephaestus, the keeper of the labyrinth, and while his kookiness is most welcome, he is granted around ten minutes screen time. And finally poor Rosemund Pike, playing a tough queen, gets knocked down and around by both monsters and a two dimensional character arc. Wrath of the Titans' only improvement is it's special effects, which are indeed quite amazing. Kronos, while suffering from short screen time, is an awesome sight, except for when he stands( too much torso, not enough leg). His arms of molten rock spew destruction everywhere, and you can see the money on the screen. Other titans fair just as well, but the director seems unsure of the effects work, and keeps the camera jittering along. Overall, Wrath really did nothing that Clash didn't do, and failed to truly entertain. the only time my heart beat fast during the movie was when the Prometheus trailer came on in 3d. That was the highlight of the film.",Wrath of the Titans
161,doomas10,feel the wrath of the spectacle,8,30 March 2012,"Everyone knew and knows that i HATED with passion the first film. It was beyond terrible. It wasn't even mindless fun for my standards. The main hero was annoying to say at least who kept moaning "" i will do this as a man"", his choices were contradicting with the previous ones he recently made, the direction was faceless, the action utterly unexciting and despite the promise of a monster-gathering, it wasn't that interesting after all. The generic designs and the lack of an energetic direction or at least set pieces generated an incredible borefest. And let's not talk about the story. It made no sense and it wasn't that simple to follow even though the initial premise was ""A going to B to achieve C"". Only saving grace was the inspiring for the god characters cast which at the end was a wasted artistic opportunity.Thus, i am in the pleasant position to announce that despite the irrational story presented in the ""Wrath"", this sequel is ten million times better than the first. Of course it won't be given the title of a ""very good"" film, hell not even a ""good"" one, but the ""entertaining"" caption would be spot on. The talented hack Jonathan Liebesman (of the ""Texas chainsaw massacre: the beginning"" and ""Battle: Los Angeles"" fame) manages to bring actually some gravitas and nerve to the proceedings, more compelling (than the first attempt of Leterie) characters, flawless CGI and surprisingly witty creature design and clever production design.""Wrath"" feels actually closer to the spirit of Sony's ""God of War"" video game series. This can be seen when the Titan Cronos makes his well conceived and executed appearance. At this point the film reaches cosmic proportions, making the Kraken to look like a baby doll. While most films disappoint when they reach the long-awaited climax, ""Wrath"" offers more and more spectacle of biblic level. The special effects are stunning and i cannot take from my head the scale of awesomeness that was displayed in front of me. The whole screen was on fire and the lava effects looked undeniably...sophisticated! Just for the appearance of Cronos, the film deserves the price of admission alone. This was directed by the same dude of one of the most horrible horror prequels of all time and one completely forgettable ""B:LA""?Or maybe it was the fact that my expectations were so low that i ended up astonished by the effort seeing on screen. Hell, they don't even take themselves seriously. Americanised one liners and some small shots of humor make the whole experience more...fun. The cast is doing what they can with the unfortunately still weak material. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes (give awards to the casting director) are the standouts of the movie with more than i thought characterization and a bit more complicated relationship that caught me off guard. Edgar Ramirez as Ares is also awesome but he has limited screen time like Danny Houston's Poseidon. Maybe a director's cut will add a bit depth? Who knows. And yes Sam Worthingthon is actually DECENT in this rather than a whiny loser. He gets to kick some ass from one famous Greek monster to another unlike the first film where he did nothing (without the help of gods)Hence, there is not a single shot of sunshine acting, no room to breathe. The sequel moves with bullet speed from one innovative action sequence to another with thrilling fights and larger than life monsters. That's good but sometimes it may tire those who are not familiar to non- stop roller-coaster rides and hand-held camera-work. Additionally, some silly plotwists-gods can die, extra betrayals, other main gods are not present?! (Apollonas, Hermes, Aphrodite etc)- seem to be happening for the creation of more ancient Greek mayhem on screen. My main complaint though is that i still haven't seen a god fighting a god with devastating effects. Maybe the third time around?Despite knowing the mythology as a Greek inside and outside, this is not an adaptation of the famous myths but a damn entertaining film that knows how to pleasure film fans with non-insulting material. You just need to switch off your brain just before you go inside the theater and all will be fine. Mark my words!+ witty production design, larger than life blockbuster, epic in scale, good cast, brilliant action sequences - story could have a bit more depth, when are we going to see a god vs a god??8/10",Wrath of the Titans
162,shadow_matraa,Wrath of One Titan,5,18 August 2012,"I really wanted to like - and even loved this movie, because I love Greek Mythology and the whole cast. But unfortunately I didn't and came away unsatisfied. My first problem I had with the movie were the fight scenes. They were awfully written. So poor. Please watch it and evaluate it yourselves. If you find no error, skip to the end fight. You expect it to be a phenomenal bomb-boozzul, but Percy just goes into Kronos' spine and evaporates things. Okay? Umm.Secondly, like I said, I am a Greek Mythology geek! I really loved the casting and the portrayal of Zeus, Hades & Ares to be honest. That was good! But - I was appalled by the way they portrayed Hephaestus. I just couldn't imagine him being like that! And his lines were so clumsy and awful, which made it even worst for me to watch.The Mythology involved was lacking a lot. They left out 85% of the Olympians and made them go cleaning Mt. Olympus or on a holiday in Hawaii or something. I couldn't, wouldn't, won't imagine Athena, Artemis, Apollo, or Hera (mainly) to go slip away and hide while the Titans return. I mean, Athena is the Goddess of War. She's Ares' counterpart and equal and obviously, he didn't shy away. The monsters that 'returned' was a Chimera who looked like a rag-doll and those weird fighting creatures that looked like they were from God of War. (Not a bad thing, but they were the only two.) The Minotaur doesn't count. It/He just came out of nowhere and died a minute later. Most randomest thing ever.So, the movie lacked quite a lot. The only good things were the special effects! They were good. But it didn't add up at all. It was like the directors/writers and everyone else involved, wanted to create the movie for the sake of having special effects. 4/10. Someone needs to change the director/writer/screen-players/producers but keep the cast and the special-effect crew.",Wrath of the Titans
163,chascoop-04195,It's a Spectacle. It Does What It's Intended To Do,4,23 September 2021,"The original Clash Of The Titans was fun for its camp value. The special effects were simply, and clearly, claymation. It appealed to the youngest children because of its relatability to popular forms of animation prevalent in the late-1970's/early-1980's. It appealed to adults for its corniness and camp value.The modern Titans movies don't even attempt to pursue those values. They're simply intended as spectacles, and they achieve that goal. If these movies had come-out in the late-1990's/early-2000's, when CGI effects-driven spectacle movies were the newest thing, these movies would have been on par with the Lord Of The Rings movies.But in the modern era, when every movie can have, and/or does have, fantastic CGI effects, to genuinely hold the viewers' interest, something more is necessary- a plot and characters the viewers feel vested in. The modern Titans movies don't have either. They exist simply for the ""watch and be astounded"" effect. And they're fine in that role. The problem is that there are so many movies which simply serve that purpose now, that they're run-of-the-mill.If you're bored at 3am and there's nothing else on TV while you're playing computer games, Wrath Of The Titans is fine.",Wrath of the Titans
164,scottemery,Crash Bang Whallop (Wrath?) of the titans,4,2 May 2012,"Before I begin let me say I enjoyed the first film (6/10), I thought the action was pretty decent, the plot was wobbly of course, the acting was bad, but unlike most I liked the use of 3D in the film and thought it added something to it unlike most of the other 3D rubbish that year.This film really did what I expected it do though. The scriptwriters/100,000 monkeys with typewriters obviously used all there decent(if that) ideas in the first and now the sequel kinda feels like its outta ideas. I'll try not to spoil the plot here for you, though it is irrelevant to the course of the film, but there's a part where all the power gets sucked out of Zeus REAALLY SLOWLY so to allow Perseus to have time to beat up all the rubbish demons and traverse his way through the deadly labyrinth (which takes up about 5 minutes of screen time cause the writers can't really think of any ideas other than ""oh there trapped again for a bit"") so it's kinda like they can't come up with a decent way to thicken the plot.The main actor (Sam Worthington) annoys me a lot in this film as he can't even be bothered to get rid of his Australian accent for the film, which really kinda shows how much effort he actually put into it. Another thing is that there's about 3 characters in the film which are just there to thin things out, literally there's one guy who Perseus has to spend 10 minutes of screen time to get to it and then take him some where else. In the end this makes the film boring, that's the main difference between this and the last because of the three things I have just mentioned you just end up bored by the end because there was so much filler.Not to be to much of a stab in the gut to the this film the three British actors (Neeson, Fiennes, Nighy) add something to the film in terms of screen presence or comedy and the action scenes are pretty decent with some OK use of 3D (NOT enough to make the film worth watching in 3D may I add). Also the massive fight off at the end was pretty damn good, though look out for the final battle as my friend Adam did notice that it has a similar feel to a gaviscon advert4/10. Some decent shots, not nearly enough to make up for a bad film though",Wrath of the Titans
165,peter-sweeney,Belter,9,2 April 2012,"Totally really enjoyable movie and brilliant in 3d! Superb effects! Disengage your brain, take in the diabolical liberty taken with these Greek mythology characters. So much is given to perceived inaccuracies in the movie about the ""gods"" real roles. Nobody knows anyway. All we really know are their names and what they are Gods of....! These professional critics bang on about wooden acting - well really! The acting is secondary to the special effects, and I thought they all done a good job (with a slight reservation about Bill Nighy).Sam Worthington takes a lot of stick, so how come he seems to be in the films i've enjoyed recently ""man on a ledge""; ""the two titans""; ""Avatar"". To me he is an excellent action actor and can express humour e.g. his relationship with Pegasus. Pegasus taps him on the rear with his wing in a surly manner.So yeah, the action moves unabatedly and builds to several climax scenes.Have to say bit of a shame for Kronos that having been slumbering in the underworld for limitless years, his time on earth, actually on the ground, lasts approximately 10 minutes! - unlucky chap.",Wrath of the Titans
166,WydeOpen,Technolo,8,3 April 2012,"Wrath of the Titans (review by Jonathan McMillan) Studio: Warner Bros. Run time: 99 minutes.Plot: Perseus braves the treacherous underworld to rescue his father, Zeus, captured by his son, Ares, and brother Hades who unleash the ancient Titans upon the world..Cast: Sam Worthington, Liam Neeson and Rosamund PikeRating: Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and actionBottom Line: ***Review : I have to admit I was very apprehensive when I got the call to review the screening of this sequel to the 2010 lackluster remake. Although the first movie was somewhat entertaining, it didn't live up to the expectations of my 10 year inner-child who fell in love with the 1981 original. As a matter of fact in my review of that film I stated that remaking the cult classic was a classic example of not knowing when to quit while you're ahead.And to top it off, in an attempt to capitalize on the success that Avatar, the producers of 2010s remake added 3D effects in post-production which made the movie a visual train wreck that was absolutely torturous to watch. However after seeing the trailer to Wrath of the Titans, my interest was piqued by the scope of the special effects and the hopes that Warner Bros. studio learned from their mistakes.I'm very glad to say; my hopes were not dashed.Finally, movie making technology has advanced to do justice to the stories that the Greek storytellers captured our imaginations with for thousands of years. Wrath of the Titans is 99 minutes of 3D computer generated imagery that accurately projects on screen what the world of ""gods and titans"" must have looked like. Rather than the original intent of the Greek myths to serve as moral parables, the plot of Wrath of the Titans serves only to show the truly awesome capabilities of what Hollywood technology can do now-a-days. The cinematography renders astonishing beautiful landscapes upon which two- headed fire spewing monsters and the sort, wreck havoc and attempt to kill our Perseus (Sam Worthington of Avatar) and his crew.Technically the film is about Perseus' heroes journeys to save the Olympian gods Zeus, Possiden and Hades (respectively played by super actors: Liam Neeson, Danny Huston and Ralph Fiennes) from the wrath of their mythological father the titan Cronos.Nevermind the plot and it's stars though. The movie really is just a vehicle showcasing a world of amazingly ""realistic"" rendered one-eyed creatures 20 stories tall called cyclops' who attempt to smash our protagonists with towering tree trunks. A world where a half man/ half bull creature called a minotaur stalks our hero's in a bafflingly M.C,Escher-esque ever shifting labyrinth. I whole-heartedly believe scenes like these are what todays 3D technology is made for.Unlike the 2010 movie, the audience which will enjoy this movie will be broader than (as I said in my last review) ""a very specific target audience – those made of snips of snails and puppy dog tails"" because the CGI and 3D special effects are so awesome that this movie is overall, very entertaining. Don't look for it on the the list of Best Picture nominees during Academy Award season, however I wouldn't be surprised if it did win some Oscars in some of the technical categories.",Wrath of the Titans

Slightly better than par for the course in terms of movies and how they are made nowadays.I disagree with the many reviews claiming Sam Worthington did a lousy job. I found myself rooting for him at times throughout the film. Hes not some uber handsome shallow jerk and hes actually quite small.Audience members like to bash performances but couldn't for the life of them do it themselves. Audience members have no idea how hard performing is. Sam did just fine. So did everyone else in the film.The acting can only be as good as the writing in the end. And this movie is very short on the writing side. I think all the actors did fine considering what they had to work with.I recommend a watch if you got some time on your hands and its on cable.,Wrath of the Titans

The father of the three gods, is a head of monster. Zeus , Poseidon, and Hides fought against their father. What a brilliant idea! That is why myth is attractive.

The fighting sequences were significantly better than its predecessor. Perseus is a great character who is probably one of the only characters that actually has some depth to their acting besides Liam Neeson. I feel like this makes a pretty good story using Greek mythology except that they didn't provide enough background information on other important gods. The only real problem that i had with this movie was that I saw it in 3D. It wasn't used as well as I thought it might be.

I have never seen such a great movie bashed so much on its opening weekend since Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, and we all know why the media was so busy weighing in on that one. This is as good as Lord of the Rings- perhaps even better considering original source material. So it gets me wondering, why is the media machine taking a crap on this movie?

There's only one titan here. I was expecting titans as in the title. Cronos looks so dumb to father the so called gods of Olympus. But maybe that's because he was imprisoned in Tartarus for eons.

I was expecting a somewhat average film after the disappointing remake of the original. All the characters played their roles very well especially Zeus and Hades. The version I saw was 3d, and the use of it was much better this time around scenes with falling rocks, Pegasus flying, and other scenes had a strong presence with the 3d. A couple weaknesses I saw in my opinion were the character representations of Hephestus and Hades toward the end. Hephestus was seemed to be way scrawnier, too good looking, not serious enough, and too weak for a god. He was a solid character just wish they made him more represented to how he was in myth. Also without spoiling the character change of Hades toward the end was a little interesting, but felt it shouldn't have been done. The effects were in this movie were awesome especially for Cronus. It also has some great fight scenes that really get you blood pumping.

And that as a HUGE fan of Greek mythology, and a somewhat fan of the first movie, I really wanted to like this movie. Anyway, here goes, the good, the bad, and MY conclusion.The Good: 1. The CG! Most of the time and money was spent on this department, and it shows! 2. There were a few funny lines. 3. A lot of action (almost too much actually).The Bad: (this list could be really long if I wanted, so I'll just stick to the big things)1. This movie feels so rushed!!! They don't set up ANYTHING. It's impossible to care for ANY of the characters. The make the monsters so vast, but then they all get defeated so quickly. Even the ONE titan in a movie called Wrath of the Titans get's defeated in like 2 minutes time.2. Greek mythology in general get's butchered!!! The ways in which they depict the Gods are ridiculous. Zeus, you know that guy who overthrew his father, banished his brother, and snuck in your mom's bed impregnated her and then left without looking back. Oh yeah, he's basically Taylor Swift in this movie. Way too much ""I forgive you too"" in this movie.3. No consistency. Hades hates Zeus, and intends to destroy the whole world because of that hate, but then Zeus apologized, and now he's over it just like that. Perseus is weak enough in one battle that he takes a crazy gash from being drug in the back, and in another battle A GOD stomps his head repeatedly, and he get's cut slightly in his hair somewhere. There are so many instances it became really tough to ignore.4. EVERYTHING in this movie is just there to push the plot along. Things like Gods being powered by prayers, Gods who can only locate you when you pray to them, Andromeda having an army (someone has to die I guess), a friendly comedic thief sidekick (that's only been done a million times), ugh... I'm done I can't even finish this review. My conclusion is that this movie sucks tremendously. I was gonna rate it 4 stars because of the CG alone, and the few funny lines. But that just doesn't sound justifiable. There is just soooo much wrong with this movie. They tried to do too much, and spent all the money on the wrong things. This is no Troy, no Immortals, no Centurion... the action isn't that great, the storyline is miserable, and for a movie so big, it feels so small like they spent all their money on CG instead of sets.

Epic, over-the-top, and intense are some of the adjectives that come to mind when you think about the action and cinematography. You will be pleased visually with the Titans and epic battles. You will be tickled with a couple mythological surprises. You will leave like you left Clash of the Titans, wondering why you didn't feel completely satisfied.When I left the movie I remember thinking, ""Where is the passion?"". The realistic and unrealistic battles will keep you entertained, but you won't be as happy with the writing and acting. There was a huge absence of emotion in just about every scene. But do gods and demi-gods need to display emotion? The answer is: Yes! Most certainly! When entertaining us, wee little humans, we need to see anger, remorse, and unimaginable determination on our actors and actresses faces.One scene in particular that had lacked the emotion I was desperately seeking was in the labyrinth. Again very visually pleasing but another opportunity missed to show us character development and human struggle. It felt like I was rushed to see the action and pulled away from the story.It may sound like I beat the living tar out of this movie, but the truth is I enjoyed it quite a bit. I knew what I was getting into and it served its purpose.

You were dropped into the story and you had figure everything out. Especially if didn't remember much about Clash of the Titans, the 1st movie. The main character was not acting passionately: it looked like he had a very bad the whole movie: looked angry, looked cranky, didn't look like he was a half-god. When I am thinking about a half-god I am thinking about an enthusiastic, charismatic, passionate guy, etcetera. There was no romance. There was a kiss but it lasted a couple of seconds without any emotions or whatsoever, but especially it was not build up towards this moment! What the hell happened here? We didn't see it coming! The whole storyline expected from you to know more about the Greek Mythology: so if you didn't know that you were lost in the story.

Thank god. I did not spend the money on its theater because this film was not worth that much. It WAS better then clash, but for everything they put, it was a huge disappointment for what I expected but not bad a film. Espesially the final act. It wasn't bad and for what it was, you should watch it on DVD. What was interesting was that it was suppose to be May 18th and was suppose to feature more characters. Such as the Hydra, more of the Minotaur and a griffin. But they swithched a lot of it. Still, not a bad film",Wrath of the Titans
187,corsonb,"Well done, but disappointing",2,1 October 2012,"Let's get the compliments out of the way first: The acting and casting (minus the leads) was high quality as was the direction.Now for the important stuff... the writers should be shot. They never read the classics (or never understood them, which is more likely) and just put an action sequel on the page with no thought to the source material (which, to it's credit, the ""first"" ...and the remake... films tried to do).The casting for the first roles was horrible (the work/acting was very well done, and it wasn't Sam Worthington's fault because he is an excellent actor who is ""up and coming"", but the Australian accent was often incomprehensible and, of course, unbelievable in his role.) I feel so, so, sorry for all of the great actors who did so well but who (clearly) needed to make a few dollars by doing this piece of c*** script.For those who know something of Greek mythology (the minority), this film may be amusing. I hope the viewers will realize that. (But that's unlikely...)Nevertheless... kudos to Jonathan Liebesman for turning a garbage script into an interesting and entertaining stand-alone action film that has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Greek mythology.",Wrath of the Titans
188,harkanwar8,"A light, fun fantasy adventure with awesome 3d",8,30 March 2012,"the second installment the wrath of the titans was considerably more thoughtful then clash of the titans but that doesn't mean its brainy... some 3d sequences in the movie are actually so good that i actually jumped from my seat 2-3 times so yes the 3d was the best I have ever seen and performance by liam neeson ralph fienes were good, sam worthington as usual had a emotionless, bland look on his face the whole time and rosamund poke was not impressive either.. the overall movie could been much better.. it was a bit boring in do places and climax was kind of abrupt so the question arises that is it worth going to theatre and shedding extra bucks for seeing it 3d...

189,styujio,Wrath is better than Clash,7,8 April 2012,"I didn't even enjoy 2010s Clash of the Titans, it was a clunker and full of crap, and I think the script-writers did better in Wrath of the Titans. At least Wrath showed Bubo for a much longer time, also with a better cameo, talking with Bill Nighy! Wrath is better than Clash in the sense that its more serious and epic, although it still retains the stupid dialog and has some idiotic scenes. The idiotic scenes, actually I can only remember one, the most memorable one. That scene involves Perseus blocking the Chimera's fire with.....that's right! A wooden door!(If I'm not wrong) Guess what? When the door is hit by the flames of the demon, it simply turns black and charred! I doesn't turn into ash or whatever thing. Best scene ever. The most pathetic scene is the one involving the Minotaur, which has the screen time of less than two minutes. So, what should you do? Watch Wrath of the Titans cuz its awesome! Great movie, epic battle scenes, few touching moments (Don't even know if there's any), better script, good actors and good performances, and the best part: Monsters! Spoilers: Minotaur! Cyclopes! Kronos! Makhai! Chimeras! To sum up this review-Go watch Wrath of the Titans!",Wrath of the Titans

There is hardly any emotion, you don't really come to like the characters, it wasn't a good story, all i can really say is that it was just dry. It looks cool n everything but it didn't move me in any kind of way.

192,deltafire1972,Medusa's revenge: A decapitated action packed thriller.,8,30 March 2012,"Disclaimer: This review will not be one of the traditional ones. But following it closely you will see why I set it this way.Ah beautiful Medeusa. How dreadful you lost your head the last movie. Your spirit and body however live on. This movie is dedicated to you in many ways.Let's start with the body. Slender, sleek, muscular, full of action, little drama, and lots of lean muscle tone. The action scenes were done pretty well on the battles. The movie begins 10 years after the battle with the Krakken. In that time, it appears the Gods have been overthrown and Olympus has fallen. The only titan, besides Chronos (and i say that literally)is one two-headed manticore. There are others alluding to Chimera, but past that, most of the war happens underground.Hades and Ares join forces, overthrowing Zeus and killing Posiden. Ares apparently is deeply resentful of the love Zeus shows to Perseus. Like the jealous older brother, he sees releasing Chronos as the ticket to his revenge. After Posiden is killed, they kidnap Zeus and begin using his power to release Chronos. The only way to kill Chronos is by uniting the three weapons forged by Hephaestus.Perseus is joined by a second demi god Agenor (posiden's son), and Hephaestus, in their attempt to enter the underworld. After a fierce battle with ares at the doorway to the underworld, Hephaestus is killed while buying time for Perseus and Agenor to escape.Once in the Underworld, they encounter Zeus, and in trying to free him, Zeus is mortally wounded by Hades' pitchfork, which was lost in a fight with ares. The lightning bolt had been stolen by Ares, with Posiden's trident given to Perseus before he died.Now we come to the tail of this story. In the final battle, Perseus kills Ares and takes the lightning bolt, completing the spear. Hades has given Zeus his last energy in an attempt to save him, but in the battle with Chronos, he falls mortally wounded a second time, leaving Hades the only brother left alive. Hades has no more power and being the last God showing, leaves the earth in the hands of Perseus. This sets up the third movie and who knows what will happen.Now we come to the head. Ah yes remember the head? In this case the head is the introduction of the movie, filling in people on what happened that made Olympus fall. It also lacks a baseline plot and structure. Movie goers are left to make up their own impressions. As for the ""wrath of the titans,"" if you count the two headed sword things at the end of the movie and one manticore, they are non-existent. We were expecting to see a battle between the gods and the Titans, with mortals fighting in the fray as well. That of course was not what was shown. That portion of the movie, the head is why this one falls short of expectations.Overall, great movie, but needed a lot more storyline and development of the plot. Hence the analogy to Medeusa, a body and a tail. The head is lost to the seas. This should be a lesson to the movies that follow. Don't lose your head.",Wrath of the Titans
193,mmcca286,Should have been another movie,5,21 April 2012,"After watching the movie I had to tell myself why did I watch this? I'm not saying the movie was bad but they did the most of what they was dealt. In my opinion the first movie was average at best considering who's the main actor. for a movie to have some of the best actors they sure did ruin their rep. and Sam Worthington is about the worst actor i ever seen. if it wasn't for Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes surrounding Sam it would have been a bigger disaster than it was to begin with. and to kill off Gemma Arterton as Io was a big mistake, if you do that get a better replacement than Rosamund Pike, this movie is by far the worst of the two. the plot of the movie was bad, the 3D effects was the only thing that kept my attention other than that the movie was a bust.",Wrath of the Titans

When I hear new Clash of the Titans was made I became excite and run for cinema to see. It was disappoint. Not terrible but not very good. So Wrath of the Titans release and I think it must be greater than Clash of the Titans! I go to see at local cinema with my mother who is big fan of Liam Neilson. After watching movie mother shake her head. I ask about mothers condition. She say to me she love Liam Neilson as favorite actor and see this movie make her heart heavy. It is like she learned Liam Neilson paid money for secret time with ladies of night. I comfort mother and promise her to study English and make review of this movie! Then others with love for Liam Neilson can understand not to watch! So I do not recommend this movie! Story is not interesting. Effects are too much and not striking. Acting is poor especially of Sam Worthington!2 of 10 **,Wrath of the Titans
196,ruskaret,Lacking story,3,10 June 2018,"Good:
The scenery, cgi and costume design is great, and you could probably just cut a selection of random parts of any scenes and it'd be a great trailer.Not so good:
Now trailers usually don't give much story, and neither did this film. It seemed like all the storythreads they had, were missing bits and pieces. It was like they were trying to make the story as thin as possible, or as if the producer was afraid a story would get in the way of all the fighting and cgi.Annoyments:
* Perseus decides not to save the world with his father in order to protect his son? Oh yeah, he's just a semi god, so he's just semi-logical?
* Poseidon's great fear was to die, to become - nothing. His internal stuggle to overcome this fear and join Zevs again is given 3 seconds
* A labyrinth was built in ancient times that looked like it would take years to pass through. Luckily they have a map and a navigator. Unluckily the producer thinks there is too little fighting going on, so he decides the map is useless, and so is the navigator and swish, swosh, swish, five minutes later they are through!
* I could go on and on, but probably the most useless part of the film was the love story (all films must have a hero and a blonde who kiss in the end right?). If you decide to watch this film, highly against my recommendations, then please amuse yourself by following this exceptionally romantic love story that is entirely absent until the very end and, try to make sense of it.",Wrath of the Titans
197,dorothewatcher,Sci Fi Channel is missing a movie.,3,2 April 2012,"I tried to enjoy this for the mindless action quotient & I still found myself disappointed. The film had great CGI creations, but on a whole the CGI alone couldn't save this film from being a turkey. Bad acting, bad plot and poor performances from a cast that could have been stellar. I've seen virtually all of the actors in other features where they far outshine the performances that were given in this film. In my opinion I'd say that you should wait for Netflix...this is another in the long line of over hyped huge budgeted cash grabs that Hollywood has become known for lately. Things are certainly disheartening when the executives that green light these films keep their jobs & the art of great film gets shoved aside for profit.",Wrath of the Titans
198,pozzible,Worthy of a good time,8,30 March 2012,"Wow, I love it when Hollywood surprises me. Wraith of the Titans was a good movie, not great, not epic but good. Sam Worthington is much better in this movie, usually very stiff, he is definitely learning to express himself better. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are awesome as always, and their own story line was great. Now Rosamund Pike was under used however she did a great job, I just wanted more of her, who wouldn't? (wink) The story is good, straight forward and the special effects are great. I saw this in 2D and didn't think I lost anything, might see it in 3D. The main difference here as opposed to Clash was the characters were much more lively, more interesting and more enjoyable to watch. Toby Kebbell does an excellent job of keeping the mood light and funny, making this a very entertaining ride.",Wrath of the Titans
199,jmberkland,Better than its rating,9,1 July 2012,"I went to rent this from DirecTV.com and its overall score was 2/5 stars. I almost didn't rent it because of the poor review, and then remembered how the Denzel Washington starring John Q fared so poorly at its initial release in terms of how it was reviewed by critics and how it ended up being a tremendously inspiring movie.We went ahead and rented ""WRATH"" and within 20 minutes we all agreed it was already faring better than a 2/5 type of movie.The enemies were visually perfection-like, the action was continuous, and there were some ""spoilers"" i don't want to name but the climax has some team-ups that just make the movie epic and memorable.If you liked ""CLASH"" I think ""WRATH"" can pass your expectations",Wrath of the Titans

201,styxxoo1,Exactly what a story as ridiculous as one involving the Greek Gods needed.,7,9 March 2013,"I am honestly at a loss for the low rating this movie gets. And especially for the comments on it. This isn't a movie about Achilles or Hektor, or about any myth based on the actions of people These are supposed to be Gods and Demi-gods. Monsters and demons and Titans.. The way I see this movie is as the campfire stories that soldiers would tell each other. What the people of Ancient Greece thought their Gods were up to. I wasn't expecting much, but I was expecting it to be grand. And it was grand. Not much of a story, or any depth to the characters (though I did love the Zeus and Hades thing).Exactly what a story as ridiculous as one involving the Greek Gods needed. When Bay made Transformers all about the explosions I was mad. That is because the underlying story of The Transformers was already established and he actually chose to discard that in exchange for some fuzzy action and cheap laughs. But does anyone actually imagine a battle between Gods and Titans.. OK, one Titan To be anything other than ridiculously, mountain destroying grand? Maybe because I saw it from the comfort of my couch and not stuck in a theater wearing 2 pairs of glasses for some bull**** 3D. But I enjoyed it. Much better than it's predecessor.When I hear a story about a God fighting a Titan I care more about the fight, than any character history. It's like saying Shoot 'em Up is a bad movie because they didn't explain why the whore was a whore No, I want gun-play.",Wrath of the Titans

203,reloadandrevolt,"Well paced, good action!",8,6 April 2012,"I'll start this by saying, I was disappointed with 2010's ""Clash of the Titans."" Everyone was in their typecast roles, the script was hammy and flat, and the action scenes -- the most valuable element of a summer action blockbuster -- were hit or miss.HOWEVER, ""Wrath of the Titans"" does not suffer from those symptoms. It's an honest, to-the- point action film, that moves smoothly from action scene to action scene with great pacing. It's been a while since I've watched a film that feels like an ""adventure"" -- and you get that experience with a few of the film's larger set pieces, particularly the maze sequence. The adrenaline fun is balanced with good humor from Toby Kebbell, who plays Agenor, Perseus's cousin, and a reluctant hero with a vibrant personality.Get your candy and your drug of choice, and go into this movie looking for a good time. Don't go in with bizarre movie expectations. This is an action movie, it's not out to deceive you that it's more than that.

205,drunkndasoul,Why is there so much bashing?,8,31 March 2012,"K i'd like to start off by questioning, why is there so much bashing going on to Clash of the Titans remake?? yes , there was disappointing in which they should not have changed from the original. BUT it does not make it a bad movie or the fact that the first one had plenty of action and if you ask me a bit of the same dialog as the sequel.Also , i thought the Medusa scene and Kraken scene was amazing in that film.(thats my opinion though) With that said i thought the remake if you look at it as its own movie , was not that bad and completely underrated. Alright, with that said, the sequel is a def. B+ movie. It has a ton of action in it and yes the plot was not really that focused on as much as it should have been. Do i think the action was senseless? No, majority of the films action was necessary and went with it. (its Greek mythology people-there is tons of key and action points in it) A lot of the CGI was awesome, Chronos looked awesome as well and so did everything else. The story did go off a bit, but it did stay on course of what they were trying to do. I think the only problem i had was Aries and another part but i don't want to spoil. I think Aries was to light and not enough bad ass for me.All in all i'm not gonna sit here and use a lot of words that people will no understand anyways and try to look like a critic but for those that want a straight answer and rely on reviews as whether to see a movie. I'd say go see this movie, it is very action packed and good Greek mythology mixture.",Wrath of the Titans

The boys, the father, and a father's yearning for acceptance from his son. However, as the movie continued, it lacked imagination and was predictable. By the end, I met the 'cheesy' side of the movie and was uncomfortable to even bare. This movie started out well but lacked the complexity of keeping imagination alive. Plot weakened throughout and all that was left was fighting and a rated B movie. Acting was fine as these actors are experienced and believable. However, even great actors have their limits and felt that the whole story became unbelievable. Save your money, wait until it hits Redbox.",Wrath of the Titans

The reason why I gave the movie a 6 in the first place was because of the special effects which are pretty good. Aside from the visuals there isn't much to this movie at all which lends it to a 5 or less. The main problems boil down to bad writing/pacing, no character development, and predictability. The story could have used a lot more twists, or at least one we didn't see from a mile away. There are things that happen in the movie too that make you think ""okay that was random."" The WORST part of all is watching all of these amazing actors wasting their talent on a quick ""put-together"" sort of movie that could have been something great. It's pretty bad when some of the best actors around can't save a film from becoming completely meh. The action ain't bad but I can guarantee we've all seen better.",Wrath of the Titans
208,Duaneparker,A hell of a good time,8,1 April 2012,"I have read the reviews on here and I am convinced people are reviewing this film without actually seeing it. I think people are still angry about the post 3D conversion of the first film and are looking for ways to recreate that drama on blogs. This film is not meant to be an Oscar contender, it is merely an action packed entertaining popcorn flick and on that front it delivers hard and fast.The plot is basic, Zeus (Liam Neeson) is imprisoned by his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes)and the only one who can save him is his son Perseus (Sam Worthington). But I don't want to use this review to write the plot which is available everywhere. What I do want to do is let people know that this film is far superior to it's 2010 original.The action and special effects scenes are fantastic and they are what really elevate this film from other sword and sandal movies. The scenes with Kronos are possible some of the best special effects I have seen in an action/adventure movie and I found myself having a few WOW moments, something that I rarely do.I saw this film in 3D and it is beautifully rendered, I honestly think those complaining about the 3D have not seen it in 3D because the conversion is flawless, the depth is great and really stands out during some of the major action sequences.One let down was the acting, Sam Worthington doe's not seem remotely worried during the entire movie, even during scenes when his son could be in danger he has the same expression on his face, during a scene when he tells his son he loves him the line is delivered so badly that people in the theater laughed which took away from the tender moment it was supposed to be.All in all we had a great time though and really enjoyed the film for what is was, an over the top special effects driven adventure movie, and on that alone I would highly recommend it to others",Wrath of the Titans
209,ian-edmonds,My name is Gerald Marshall,6,1 April 2012,"Let me start by saying that I loved this movie. Those who are complaining about the story are just being overly critical. That is the critics job. The story is easily enough understood. Perseus is trying to stop the titans to protect his son. Simple as that. The action scenes and CGI are fantastic and the final battle will blow you away. There are many references to Greek mythology and this movie lets you see more of the gods and their awesome powers. The only reason this gets a nine is because the 3-D kind of sucks, but who cares?

210,BluRayChase,Well....Ummm....The Battles Were Cool,5,30 March 2012,"This movie is almost identical to its predecessor, albeit a larger emphasis on WOW factor in the fight scenes. If you hated the repetitive mythology references, acting that lacks conviction and emotion and a plot with more holes than a sponge then you will be returning to familiar territory with Wrath Of The Titans. The casting in this movie, was its biggest downfall. Not a single actor was convincing in their roles. Worthington, at best, was monotone and offered very little emotion in times that needed it. Don't get me wrong, i think he was great in Man On A Ledge. Even Liam Neeson looked like he walked off the set of Grey and straight onto this one :)The battle scenes, apart from one, are awesome. The two-headed hound wreaking havoc through their shanty town, the trio of Cyclops, the sword wielding demons who are joined back-to-back, are all scenes which keeps the viewer genuinely interested. The Minotaur scene however had garbage lighting and camera work and all you saw was a blur of bodies followed by a ""hills have eyes resemblance"" face of the dying beast. The final fight scene, saves the movie from a 2star rating. The CGI is nothing short of spectacular, the acting is adrenaline fueled and you start to feel like your there...BUT..then the credits roll....",Wrath of the Titans

In this one the gods fly through emotions entirely too quickly for the watcher to get a grip on any of them. One second they're angry and wanting to kill each other and the next all is forgiven and they're working together. I also don't like that that the gods were killed off and turned to dust...that just didn't sit well with me. Clash of the Titans was a much more visually stunning and adventurous film than Wrath...still if mythology is your niche I would suggest seeing it.

It is definitely the worst movie I've seen all year, I can only imagine very young children finding it enjoyable and even their mental capacity might be too great for this one.The characters are unconvincing, Sam Worthington was terrible in contrast to his performance in Avatar and the screenwriter should be taken out to pasture. The worst part is that you never really care about the story or any of the characters at all.Toward the end we were actually laughing at some of the lines and the direction that the story went!

But there are a lot less varieties of monsters in this movie. I have to say the part I like best is within the first 10 minutes, i.e. the fight with the dual-head dinosaur. After that there is not much left to see. Actually, there could have been more fights and outlandish creatures in the Labyrinth, besides the Minotaur. On the other hand, if I were the director I wouldn't give that much time to Zeus, Hades and Ares. You can not explain to the audience in five minutes why gods suddenly lose their power and become mortals anyway. I also find it a little odd when Zeus was cured by Hades for a moment only to be followed by his death in the fight with Cronus in one blow. It reminds me of other movies when characters relived with no reason or died in obscure ways.",Wrath of the Titans

219,liveactionman1,Gods are like Santa when you stop wishing they DIE!!!,4,31 March 2012,"Wrath of the Titans is directed by Jonathan Lebesman, you know the guy who made that god awful 'Battle L.A', Lebesmen has seemed to of caught Transformers syndrome where in the recipe to make a movie he seems to have forgotten the all too important part..a STORY, which since i last checked is quite a important part of a movie.This movie only seems to exist because the directors thought since they already made a first movie with character development,interactions and relationships that they could skip that and go straight to the action. The only problem with this is that the first movie was completely forgettable, ask anyone what they remember from the first movie and they will say ""uurrrm RELEASE THE KRAKEN, and they f-ing killed the kraken to bloody fast"", and that's all. The whole movie is based on the fact that when people stop praying to gods they lose their power, and that kind of reminded me of all those bad Santa movies were when children stop believing he would lose his power. Anyways, the story revolves around Sam Werthington's character Perseus, which luckily enough happens to live in a small fishing village just outside where all the action happens. Zeus played once again by Liam Neeson, requests Perseus to help him, because the gods are having a cry that people don't believe in them. As a result of this, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), attempts to steal Zeus' power which for some reason would waken kronos. The only way to stop this from happening YOU GUESSED IT, is to go on a quest to find three fragments that when put together would could stop Kronos, and that's about all I could get before my brain stopped functioning properly.The movie plays out much like a video game going from one set peace to another, only changing after Sam Werthington has killed something big and loud. He is joined by Toby Kebbell's character Agenor who is there only as comic relief BUT ISN'T FUNNY, and .... okay let me just rant about this for a bit, Rosamund Pike, the only female character in this movie, for no f-ing reason is the leader of a large army, she only exists as a love interest for Perseus, she apart from that contributes nothing to this movie her acting is terrible, and he character is ill- written. And for her army They are merely things to kill for the various monsters that Sam and his merry men happen to bump into on there quest. Some action sequences are cool I guess, but with no real understanding of why any of this is happening kinda feel deflated. As i watched the movie i began too realise, how much alike this movie is with the 'Immortals' (story wise), and how much I liked the 'Immortals'. The acting was solid, the story while no God Father was decent and the action scenes were so over the top, bloody, balls-to-the-walls fun that even a 90 year old philosophy teacher would shed a smile. Too summaries, if you want to go watch this movie i suggest going to the store and buying Immortals. It is just superior in every way, thanks for reading.",Wrath of the Titans

221,therealjuansanchez,"""Gods don't die."" They do now.""",4,1 April 2012,"""Gods don't die."" They do now."" Wrath of Titans, the latest entry in the jumble of CG dominated sword and sandal films that have spilled from Hollywood over the past few years, is unsurprisingly littered with prosaic colloquy throughout its 99-minute runtime. Sadly, these uninspired exchanges represent some of the film's stronger writing as Wrath is dominated by dialogue consisting of characters simply yelling each other's names in various states of distress. ""Perseus!"" ""Andromeda!"" ""Helius!"" ""The Navigator!"" I could have sworn I even heard someone yell out my name. ""Cutter! Go home and watch The Immortals on Amazon Video. You'll enjoy it more!"" It's a shame I did not listen.Wrath picks up where its predecessor Clash of Titans left off, with Perseus (Sam Worthington), son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and slayer of the Kraken, now living a quiet life as a village fisherman, father and widower. He is reluctant to join the latest fight to save the world, but is soon forced back into action when poppa Zeus is captured by his sinister brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and hell beasts, presumably Titans, are set free upon the Earth to reek havoc. So what is Hades' end game? That is where the story takes a plunge toward the absurd, even for this film. Hades, realizing the Gods are now facing extinction due to man's eroding worship, plots to kidnap Zeus and transfer his power to their evil father Kronos, imprisoned in hell stone by Zeus and Hades years earlier, in the hope that Kronos will, after freeing himself and destroying the very beings that give the Gods their power, be merciful and somehow help him secure his immortality. Uhokay.Adventure films need not be entirely plausible or coherent to be successful, but they must, in the immortal words of Maximus Decimus Meridius, answer the question, ""Are you entertained?"" There were two headed dog beasts, giant Cyclopes, spinning minotaur infantry and enough thunder and fire to squat brimstone and yet my answer is emphatically no. In fact, I prefer the messy, murky Clash of the Titans to its latest offspring, which speaks volumes since I slept through most of it.

222,cricket10,excellent movie,10,17 April 2012,"Wrath of the Titans was probably the most anticipated movie of the year 2012. But is it any good? First of all, The movie is merely based on the book. It features most of the same characters and a couple of the same locations, but the story is completely different. The only actor to come out with any real credit was the irreplaceable Bill Nighy as Hephaestus, the creator of the labyrinth that holds the father of all Kronos and the Minotaur. It is one of the quirks of modern cinema that people do find it hard to name a part in which Bill Nighy hasn't excelled at.The visuals and effects are the real saving grace of the film and whilst to older fans of the original films they lack the warmth and sincerity of the previous work, it has to be said they add a certain quality and depth, even if at one point some of it does look borrowed from an episode of Doctor Who.It's a real shame that the actors were possibly given second thought in the film over the effects and especially in Rosamund Pike, let down in a script that could have offered much more.If you enjoyed the Clash of the Titans the sequel demands to be seen, if you're a lover of Greek mythology then it will be an interesting distraction but otherwise it's a film to miss.",Wrath of the Titans

I came to this movie with the knowledge that the director had learned his lesson and can only improve the scened time, but boy was i wrong. The plot first of all is even worse then before, and the effects just can't make up for the plot. Although the cast is very rich and full of well known and great actors, none can really save one of the worst films of the year if not the Melania.I am sorry i went to see it and promise you no more.",Wrath of the Titans

225,elromal,The best 3D experience yet and a completion to a tale we've all hoped to find an ending to.,8,30 March 2012,"And finally the story continues!For those of you who grew up watching several reruns of Clash of the Titans (1981), the story of Perseus has always been an incomplete one — so Andromeda is saved, the Kraken destroyed and then what? The Wrath of the Titans answers that question and how! Yes, it's complete chaos in terms of the how the original Hellenistic myths and their portrayals have been mixed up, but at least an attempt is made to satisfactorily complete a cinematic tale that began more than two decades ago — and thank God for that! Wrath of the Titans is a sequel to Clash of the Titans (2010) and outdoes that movie by leaps and bounds. The cast remains the same with Sam Worthington as Perseus; Ralph Fiennes as Hades; Liam Neeson as Zeus; Danny Huston as Poseidon and Rosamund Pike as Andromeda. The new characters to look for are however Édgar Ramírez as Ares; Bill Nighy as Hephaestus; and the talented Toby Kebbell as Agenor, imprisoned thief and demigod son of Poseidon who joins Perseus on his journey. This tale begins a decade or so after the last tale ended. Andromeda is now a queen and Perseus has fathered a son, Helios. A war rages in the heavens and the underworld between good and evil and the gods are extremely weakened by the lack of faith and prayers from the people on earth. Taking advantage of this weakness, a pact is formed between a god and demi-god to take revenge for all the inequalities meted out to them. The plan involves releasing Kronos from the impenetrable prison Tartarus created for him in the underworld by Zeus and the other gods, after the first battle of the Titanomachy. The movie is rich in amazing CGI effects and quite vividly and intricately tells the tale of the increase in power of Kronos as he gains power within Tartarus and unleashes terrifying monsters on earth as they escape from his underworld prison. Quite incomparably the best 3D experience we've seen till date, don't be surprised if you find yourself ducking debris thrown at you from the screen! Perseus is called to action again as Zeus is betrayed and Poseidon killed. The age of the Olympian gods is on the verge of ending and hope lies in the hands of two demi-gods, one Perseus and the other the hilarious, Agenor. Perseus goes to war once again only to save his son Helios and in a wonderful change of events is taught a lesson or two in the journey. Watch out for an amazing gripping narrative stuffed with high-octane action sequences, which simply do not allow you to leave the edge of your seat. Sam Worthington has not changed much from the previous installment, he's still as dull as ever, but the gorgeous Rosamund Pike shows you a side of her as the warrior-queen Andromeda, a side we'd love to see several times again. Édgar Ramírez as Ares is however the true star and stands out even though he's not much of a hero in this tale. Much needn't be said about Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson who do fabulous jobs with the restricted characterisation they are given. The film may not go down in history as a classic and be revisited as much as the 1981 original was, but it's definitely one of the best 3D experiences yet and should be watched on Real 3D or IMAX for the optimum visual pleasure.",Wrath of the Titans

Why did I find I'd lost interest in what was going on (If indeed anything was going on) very early on. Most of the actors went through their paces with a kind of ""ummm, getting paid big bucks,better do something"" attitude, ""Big"" Liam and Mr Fiennes were pretty much strolling along and I found myself not caring who was off to find what,who had to help who to defeat whoever or who lived or died or how many times they died.Even the super eye-gouging CGI had me yawning by the end...P.S.

Save yourself some pocket money and do the following instead: lie on the ground and pour a mixture of soil and skittles slowly into your eyes whilst mumbling the names of Greek Gods. This will have the same entertainment value as the film, and a considerably better plot.Having seen the remake of the original, I went into Wrath of the Titans with my expectation level pretty low. Five minutes in, I quickly lowered it further. Ten minutes in... I buried my expectation level under my seat and stomped it into the ground - hard. But however low I set the bar, the film went lower. It's unimaginably dire.There's simply nothing redeemable about the film at all. Even the impressive effects are ruined by awful direction that renders them no more engaging than watching a ten year old playing video games through a kaleidoscope.Everyone involved in making Wrath of the Titans should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves; and to be fair Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes clearly are as they show it on screen. They both look embarrassed to be a part of it. I'm embarrassed that I bore witness to it. Please don't be a statistic and join us.

Perseus is called to help in his dying father Zeus under captive in the underworld.Perseus must find a way to reach the underworld on the course he finds help in the form of Andromeda possibly an ex love interest and Perseus's cousin Aggenor(son of Poseidon) on their way they face a wide variety of monsters big and small. Does Perseus rescue his father from underworld how does his defeat Kronos thats the USP left for u to see.What worked for me is the 3D used it is far better than what u have seen in clash of the titans but if you are expecting something the likes of avatar the this is not the movie for you the are amazing thrilling scenes.One particular scene made my actually cover my face as a reaction to an actually boulder falling on my face which wasn't in the reality.What didn't work for me is the story telling and acting Liam Nesson is the only person worth of being called an actor in this movie the others are sloppy and not able to express themselves most of the side characters are there just to add a comic sense Sam Worthington need to prove himself as an actor so does Rosamond Pike who is somewhat useless in this film Ralph Fieness as well seems to be missing his usual niece in this film.Toby Kebbel and Edgar Ramirez are OK with their performance.the film somewhat seems to start late with the actual story and end it soon as well i feel the film could have been better had it been 2hours long 99minutes was not enough to explain the film properly.Final Verdict :If u are looking for some serious story adventure the likes of LOTR the this film is not for you and if u just want be amused by some 3D awesomeness this is surely for you.",Wrath of the Titans

The movie has a lot of action and amazing CGI but there is no particular story or character development or even emotions. Here u will sit just using ur head and yes. There is no involvement of the heart to feel for the loss of anyone dying. The movie is gud if ure just into mindless action. But i feel at times the camera moves so fast that it becomes difficult to seen the clear picture of the monsters unless its in slow motion. I have seen it in 3D and some of the scenes were really good and in ur face type. but overall, not much of 3D. It makes it kinda dark. The story is quite simple as you know that the titans want to rule the world and over throw the Gods and its upto Perseus to save them. ( well, in the end you just have no Gods left). The movie is much better than clash of the titans ( though I hardly remember what that was about) and sometimes while watching Wrath of the titans, i keep thinking of Immortals, similar setup. overall, its a gud action movie. don't crack ur brain about whether to watch it or not. Its always upto u. so just put everything aside and spend ur weekend with a nice action movie. Its much better than the other junks out there. u wont come out with a headache unless ur a total Greek mytho guy and want every details. Movies are to be enjoyed, not analyzed.

There are just those films that you know are going to be cheesy morsels for the CGI gluttons out there. Now...when I go into a movie and I know it's bad, like everyone else, I go in not expecting much. This movie...however...went below that. Like everyone can probably guess, the story is terrible and predictable, so I'm not going to elaborate on that. Acting is also bad. Everyone just looked bored out of their minds making this film. The only people that seemed to be a little engaged were Bill Nighy, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Edgar Ramirez. Everyone else was just filler. So, by now I'm hoping that at least the battles will be impressive, like Transformers. WRONG! There is just so much crap before and after the big CGI scenes to the point where even those don't interest me. Plus the Minotaur just looks like an obese Gollum with horns. Here's my advice...if you want to see heroes and gods battling it out, go get the video game God of War and go play it. Or play Age of Mythology, if real-time strategy is your thing.

The action was for me most of the time mind-blowing, especially the last third of the movie. Story is much better, even though dialogues are weak, it's more light- hearted. The 3D (and I'm pretty much a 3D lover) is great, lots of pop out, great depth, works really well with the scenery, creatures, action scenes.

237,ylnot,Good action flick with great CGI,6,29 March 2012,"It was better than the first movie (Clash of the Titans - 2010) but it wasn't epic like you hope befitting of the title about Greek mythological gods. Hollywood typically likes to keep their films moving along by cutting short on story depth and character development, both of which afflicted this movie. The plot is simple and follows 10 years after the conclusion of Clash of the Titans. They kept the same cast in this sequel; Of noteworthy is Perseus, the half-god, son of Zeus, and protagonist, played by Sam Worthington (Avatar and Man on a Ledge).In sacrificing depth and char dev, the movie had a lot of action. At the heart of all the action were special effects. The CGIs were impressive and, essentially, what made the movie. A scene of fiery rocks hurling at the screen in 3D made me dodge before I caught myself. Lol The music complemented the action well and added to the visceral experience. The bass and horns were almost as loud and deep as in the movie Inception.If you dig deeper though, you may find flaws, poor logic and mythology that isn't true to Greek mythology but rather loosely based. For example, the audience can see plenty of wrath from Kronos (Greek, Cronus), but its fury translates into little substance in the battle as he was seemingly too easily beatable. You learn that the gods' powers are dependent on human prayers. W/o prayers, their powers wane and their immortality fade into dust. So Zeus isn't the immortal and all-powerful Greek god you had envisioned reading about growing up. In conclusion, if you can watch with an open mind and are OK with a shallow storyline, then the action and visual fx are worth the price of admission. It's a good action flick with great CGI. I give it a 6 to 6.5 out of 10.",Wrath of the Titans
238,andreas-biehl,Great ancient legends made into sausages,1,15 July 2012,"After having watched a rather entertaining popcorn remake of the 1981 ""Clash of the titans"" with Sam Worthington a couple of years ago, I was looking forward to getting a similar fun experience with the sequel ""Wrath of the titans"". What Hollywood ""delivered"" instead was most likely the biggest ""spoiler"" of great ancient legends ever produced. Or as we say here: Greek Myth made into sausages, i.e. an awful blend of different stories into one.On his ""odyssee"" to rescuing his godfather Zeus, Perseus teams up with a group of 3 Cyclopes to guide him to Hephaestos - with a bit of good will a reference to Hesiod's Theogony (where Zeus releases three Cyclopes, the sons of Uranus and Gaia, from the dark pit of Tartarus. They provide Zeus' thunderbolt, Hades' helmet of invisibility, and Poseidon's trident, and the gods use these weapons to defeat the Titans). However, here more a way of indulging in CGI rather than telling a story... Next spoof: Hephaestos, according to the original myth the god of fire, a master smith and due to a lame leg ""of grotesque appearance"", but a mediator during quarrels of his parents Zeus & Hera; in this movie appears rather schizophrenic while talking to one of his creations - once again the owl of the original 1981 movie. During Perseus' brawls ""filling"" the way to Zeus' prison, Perseus also kills the Minotaur in a maze, ""complicating"" the entrance to Zeus' prison a bit... (Originally the Minotaur dwelt at the center of the Cretan Labyrinth, a maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. The Minotaur was eventually killed by the Athenian hero Theseus)....The peace seeking and emphatic Andromeda Kathrine Heigl was replaced by the ""warrior queen"" Andromeda Rosamund Pike. IMHO not a good choice, as she appears more to be flirting with Perseus (or Sam? ;)) than actually making us understand and believe the severity of the danger at hand. The goof to give Roman war insignia to supposedly Greek warriors has already been mentioned above...Edgar Ramirez as Ares - the god of war - known to a wider public so far only by ""the Bourne Ultimatum"" here fills in an application form as the ""new Chuck Norris"" for complete lack of expression. A good example as to what the difference between ""acting"" and ""portraying someone"" is.To summarize: definitely a CGI festival but story-wise PAINFUL to watch!",Wrath of the Titans

241,jrubinthomas,Feel the uhh... What the heck?,1,7 July 2013,"I was exited first but found the movie to make no sense at all. Like gods dying. There was also a plot that was thinner than air. This film was actually pretty anticipating for me but then, it turned out to be garbage. I liked Liebsmans Battle LA but not this one. This was my least fav movie of this year. It was kinda fun though. The remake of ""clash"" was good but not this one. My brother is a fan of action so he gave it a 10/10 and made it his 2nd fav movie. He is the only person I know who liked it so much and I disagree with that. If this film were a student, I would give this a c+ Hope the sequel's better. It should be or I will explode into pieces.",Wrath of the Titans

This film in all honesty was poor.There is not much left to be said. The story was poor i was confused at times, scenes moved very quickly, no character development just a lot of noise & FIRE! FIRE was everywhere.I guess that is not a surprise as the title poster shows this. I can see where they spent the budget. Shame because gods, Greek mythology and all that are good subjects to make a movie about. Sam Worthington slept walked through the 1 1/2 hours and Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes characters were useless.Rosemund Pike no better.",Wrath of the Titans

244,justin-matthews-1,"It was simply okay; nothing more, nothing less",7,21 July 2012,"I went into watching this film with low expectations. The first one was pretty bad and I was hoping they stepped it up a notch. They did, in fact, they did a great deal. The story is pretty basic, a man living an average life with his family who just so happens to be a half- god is pulled into a war between good and evil. There is a main evil, and a henchman who does all his work. I know, the story does sound basic but they manage to pull it off smoothly. The visual effects are spectacular, but I think that was just the directors way of masking the mediocre acting and dry story. The movie did have its ups though, for example the fight scenes were impressive. My main problem was that the movie tried to use some comic relief, however it failed as the relief was NOT funny. Watch this movie if you're looking for a way to pass the time, but otherwise, just skip it.",Wrath of the Titans

There is no comedy, not a very good plot.But I went for this movie just for the good action and good graphics. I am more than satisfied with what is presented. Also 3D effects are very good in this movie. I like LOR and Matrix series very much and I like this series too unlike Harry Potter ,Twilight,Narnia and Transformers where only one or two parts are good and all remaining are very boring.

OK so i'd read a few reviews and seen a few ratings for this movie before going for it. was forced to go really after the sad reviews. expected it to be as bad as its predecessor. was i wrong. this movie is brilliant in your face action. some story in the middle. enough to keep things connected. its sad when people go for movies like these expecting a masterpiece like 'the godfather'. hey if stupid action movies are not your thing then please don't go for such movies. let people like us who watch movies to be entertained and not give us a lesson on life watch them. i especially loved the 3D in this movie. a lot of times i come out of a 3D feeling dizzy and ripped off. but not this time. the scenes in the underworld are too damn cool in 3D. not to mention the awesome demons from the chimera to the cyclopses. and please respect the premise of the movie and enjoy it rather than thinking ""why did he do this and not that?""

It didn't seem like an afterthought (like so many other movies) & I genuinely flinched in places.Now the bad... In Irish Zeus, an Australian Perseus, a Spanish Ares, a VERY posh English Andromeda, a broad Yorkshire Hephaestus & a country-bumpkin Agenor (sun of Poseidon)It was a Godawfull mix of accents that really didn't gel & were an affront to my ears. OK, so I wasn't expecting everybody to be speaking with Greek accents but I would have expected some kind of consistency through the characters. This mishmash of accents detracted somewhat from the film... that & Sam Worthington's monotone & somewhat stilted performance.Overall it was an OK film, but I won't be bothering to get the DVD to watch it again.",Wrath of the Titans
250,wee-steeve93,Turn off your brain and you might enjoy,3,5 April 2012,"Not a good movie. Here's what happens:Zeus asks Perseus for help yet again and Perseus says something along the lines of ""Noooo, I'll never leave my son"". So five minutes later after a random demon attacks his village, what does he do? Yeah, you guessed it. After he leaves his son, he rides his trusty steed, Pegasus (who appears out of nowhere, for no reason) to a military camp. Meanwhile, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades are meeting in the underworld, along with Zeus's son, Ares. Surprise, surprise, evil Hades betrays his brothers and teams up with Ares, who is jealous of Perseus for having his father's admiration. Zeus is captured and his powers are sapped, to allow his father Cronos to escape imprisonment in Tartarus.Anyway Poseidon escapes and dies shortly after giving Perseus his trident and his next epic quest: to save Zeus.An irrelevant quest follows, with the introduction of some pretty undeveloped and pointless characters. They head out on a boat, with the son of Poseidon to find the person who forged the Gods weapons, and also Tartarus. Pegasus is apparently left with the other horses in the military camp, his only purpose: to have Perseus fly to the camp instead of walking, because walking a long distance is not interesting.The crew reach an island and after walking a pretty long distance through a forest, run in to a Cyclops. Confusion ensues as he seems to be doing two things at once... turns out there's two of them. Perseus does what he does best: survives when he would clearly die, and they all become the best of friends.The Cyclopes lead them to Bill Nighy, he tells them all about the prison Tartarus. It's so intricate and complex to stop Cronos escaping! Remember that at the end when he gets out no problem. The squad make there way to the prison and are attacked and outmatched by Ares; Bill Nighy and Sam Worthington couldn't care less.They travel through the labyrinth, entrance to Tartarus, we've been told it messes with your mind. This is shown through the friends being angry at each other like schoolchildren for a short while. Perseus is separated from the group and encounters the most pathetic Minotaur, which of course throws him around for a while instead of killing him. It charges and gets it's horns stuck in the wall. Instead of killing the Minotaur while stuck, he breaks off its horns... Our hero defeats the monster of course and is somehow reunited with his friends, even though he fell pretty far away from them and it's a huge labyrinth.Zeus talks his brother Hades in to being good, with two sentences, even though he's pretty evil. The gang turn up for the rescue.The only way to defeat Cronos, it seems, is to join Zeus' lightning bolt, Hades' pitchfork and Poseiden's trident (all powerful, which would have came in handy in the first film) in to some super weapon. Ares should probably be aware of this, since it involves his close family, but decides to throw the pitchfork at Zeus, now Percy has the trident and pitchfork. He might have thought to throw it in to the surrounding lava, and they could never beat Cronos, but oh well.Now something happened which completely broke the movie: dying Zeus is taken to the military camp and left alone. If only Zeus' power relied on prayer and there was thousands of soldiers around, Zeus would be pretty darn powerful. Nope. Nobody thought of this. Not even Zeus. Hades shows up though and gives most of his power to revive Zeus. Didn't the first film show us that Hades gets his power from peoples fear? Hades should be pretty powerful if everyone knew Cronos was coming to get them. Nope. Either everyone is pretty fearless or Hades is on a diet.Anyway, while this is happening, random monsters (Lord knows where they came from) attack the soldiers, who die in the hundreds. They could have just said a few prayers for Zeus and they'd be fine, he dispatches the monsters easily after being revived, with a few prayers the soldiers might as well have gone for a lay down.Perseus rides Pegasus to meet Ares for a fight. Even though he has Perseus' son hostage, he doesn't even make him drop his weapons, just starts fighting. Just the kind of fight you would expect, Perceus is thrown around instead of just killed, and of course ends up winning because of the bad guys overconfidence. Ares of course brought the final piece of the super weapon puzzle for Percy to use. He could have left it literally anywhere else and the weapon couldn't be finished.Zeus and his new BFF, Hades team up to kill the demons, apparently they're all killed within two minutes. Cronos emerges. Apparently the labyrinth was no use for restraining him, only there because somebody wanted a Minotaur in the movie. So Cronos kills people, in as boring a fashion as any massive volcano man. We're supposed to be impressed. Perseus flies in on Pegasus with the finished weapon. flying through fire and lava but not being harmed, not even acquiring black ash on the face like you would expect. he flies in Cronos' mouth for some reason and drops the weapon. Before it explodes to kill Cronos, he seems to blow Zeus against a rock which is apparently fatal.Percy rides back and Zeus stands up, he looks fine but for some reason he's going to die, Percy could say a prayer and he wouldn't, but whatever. Zeus dies, Worthington shows no emotion.Movie ends with an awkward father-son chat. Looks to be setting up a sequel about the kid. I can hardly wait.The one lesson this film teaches, is that you should pray to Zeus and you wont have to get yourself killed.",Wrath of the Titans

The story is really poor and the characters are ridiculous and too simple, and the acting is very weak, specially Tobby Kebbell. The film doesn't put you into the action and you are one hundred minutes wondering what you will do the next weekend. The mythology is terribly documented and there are a lot of incredible mistakes. Okay, there are some cool action scenes and incredible monsters and creatures, that's why I put a 4 instead of a 1.I saw Clash of the titans and I've seen Wrath of the titans.

The film follows Perseus as he embarks on a quest to save his dad from Hades, Ares, and Kronos. All of the actors in the film appear to have hardly put any work into their performances especially Sam Worthington who, just like in Clash of the Titans, is completely boring making Perseus a character that no one cares for. The storyline is almost nonexistent and seems to only exist as a way to set up the next action sequence. Clash of the Titans was an absolute disaster but its campiness was hilarious and it was extremely entertaining watching Liam Neeson yell ""Release the Kraken"". Wrath of the Titans on the other hand is basically the same with decent visual effects and without any campiness at all making it an unnecessary sequel to an unnecessary remake of a decent film that was made several years ago.",Wrath of the Titans
255,kostas167,Simple plot but nice visual effects,5,4 April 2012,"----------------SPOILER ALERT--IT CONTAINS SCENARIO INFORMATION ----------------------------- PLOT: A decade after the kraken was defeated , Perseus(Sam Worthington) is called to arms once again in order to rescue Zeus( Liam Nelson),who is imprisoned in the underworld.Wrath of the Titans was a lower-expectation film than its predecessor Clash of Titans.The producers made clearly that it was not gonna be epic like the first movie(which failed). i think that is the reason why it is a little bit better film than its predecessor, because no one expected much from it.Indeed its harder for a movie to let you down , if you go to the theater with low expectations.Starting with the visual effects ,i think that they were slightly better than its predecessor.The fighting scenes had great visual effects( The fight with the Chimera was thrilling and so was the fight with the Cyclops. Also the environment (underworld etc) was very good filmed too.Its 3D was generally good ,but the effects were too few (only some rocks falling down and some smokes). Although i would like to see more effects ,i must admit that watching Wrath of Titans in 3D was a pleasant experience.The weak part of the film though was its scenario. It was way too simple, linear ,almost childish. The characters were way too simple, with no deb th at all,no vices and virtues,nothing.The acting was generally good,but with no scenario and character deb th you couldn't get thrilled of them. The whole movie was action-battle oriented and nothing more. Also it had a lot of inaccuracies like (SPOILER ALERT ) MINOTAUR in the underworld (why would it be there? it was supposed to be in Minoan Labyrinth). Also there was unrealistic. THere was a scene in which (SPOILER ALERT) Perseus gets inside the burning Kronos and when he comes out he doesn't get a single burn, while Zeus(who was a god after all) was killed from a single lava burst . I have to remind that a beast made of lava would have had like 10.000 c heat inside him.To conclude, the film was a decent 3D ,had nice fighting scenes but it had no scenario at all. It is good for childs to watch, or for an adult who can afford time and money to see something simple and relaxing. Don't watch this film if you are interested in acting and scenario more than the visual effects.",Wrath of the Titans

259,hardlyhedda,"Wrath was no Clash, but Love those Bubo burns!",7,4 April 2012,"From my review at www.hardlyhedda.com Wrath of the Titans opened to audiences across North America this week. Although it isn't touching the Hunger Games numbers, there are still massive amounts of people drawn to Greek Mythology, lots of CG Effects and of course the ever so hunky Aussie actor Sam Worthington.Ever since Avatar, Worthington has shown movie audiences world-wide that he is a leading man to be reckoned with. He can hold his own in the action genre (carrying both Titans movies), Sci-Fi (Avatar of course), and Drama (in The Debt he is thoughtful and sensitive with his portrayal of David) The movie opens telling us that Perseus (Worthington in all his shaggy haired glory) is raising a son and has lost his wife in his quiet little fishing town (his love interest from the previous Clash of the Titans (2010) Gemma Arterton was going to return to do Wrath but scheduling conflicts prevented her from returning), but trouble is brewing in the underworld and his father Zeus (Liam Neeson) needs his help to restore order among the Gods. Peace and quiet never last long when you are a demi-god! Perseus, given no choice but to save humanity once his Father Zeus is kidnapped by his brother Ares (Édgar Ramírez) and his uncle Hades (Ralph Fiennes), sets off on an action packed crusade to save the world from the titans that are being unleashed at a dizzying rate. So the movie keeps a fairly fast and captivating pace, strong performances are always given by Neeson and Fiennes who play their larger than life god characters up to the nines. Throw in a believable love interest for Perseus (British beauty Rosamund Pike) and some comic relief by way of Perseus's demi-god cousin Agenor (Toby Kebbell) and you've got yourself a fairly entertaining movie night out! Yes there were cheesy bits of dialogue, yes there were completely implausible plot points but accepting it for what it is, a sequel to a mediocre remake at best, with the sequel not even being quite as entertaining as it's 2010 predecessor. (One of my fellow movie goers pointed out that on an island with no one around why would 3 giant cyclops men take the time to shave for each other (ref: cut to close up of cyclops's face for a full stubble shot)? Speaking of stubble, the photo above shows a very life-like doll of Worthington (wonder if he owns one, that would be very Seinfeldesque-remember Mrs. Costanza's doll). If I was reviewing the doll I would have to give high marks to the sheer creepiness of its realistic traits, right down to its stubble.A highlight of Wrath for sure is the reference to Bubo, the incredibly annoying mechanical owl from the Harry Hamlin version of Clash of the Titans (1981), which incidentally was also one of the highlights of the 2010 version when they referenced that little menace.The 3D was so-so, nothing compared to the 3D trailer to Prometheus, but still better than the 2010 Clash with its one sword coming at you in the middle of the movie being the only memorable 3d effect.Run to the theatres, stroll half heartedly, wait for DVD or run away screaming? I would stroll into theatres, make it 3D, get the whole experience and don't expect too much, just sit back and be entertained mildly, because that is what Wrath of the Titans is going to do for you.",Wrath of the Titans

Consider this a success if you look for action, because that is all you get; there is poor dialogue, a story line (that could have made this a classic) that is told cumulatively within 5 minutes and acting as if it were a love story - You're Demi-Gods, not some lads on holiday looking to beat the thief that stole your dads' wallets (Toby Kebbell) ! Cerberus (guardian of Tartarus) was not even to be seen, even though the unraveling of events took place on his porch! Kronos, the much feared and anticipated Titan who was frequently mentioned baring dread throughout the film, only lasted 5 minutes while free!This film is a disaster; it controls a masterpiece, and amazingly ripped it to shreds - somehow. Was Jonathan Liebesman trying to sculpt his reputation in the form of Kronos? It's certainly as dead as him after this one. Liebesman could have made a classic; the storyline would have held with a great degree of entertainment for 2:30hrs at least, which would have explained the history of the tales in the film and the purpose of the evil perspective as well as the good, but instead quick action was preferred, or was this because of the incapabilities of Sam Worthington to perform like an actual actor, rather than a hero who knows he's a hero but doesn't live like a hero (idiotic I know) every minute of the film.

THEY WILL TRY TO STOP THE TITAN CRONOS!!! wew! what a stupid thing to do which is to stop a giant monster bathe in fire and lava! Just Stupid!..... But on the other hand, this is also fun to watch, just like watching perseus and ares fight using their weapons, which has great effects and their brute strengths, and also the part were zeus and hades fought together with the spartans and showing their inner powers which is very cool and fun to watch.So, if you are a type of person who does not have any knowledge about Greek mythology and stuffs like that, YOU WILL FEEL THE WRATH WHEN YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE, but if you do, You'll love it like me, but I just want to clarify how the director made this movie.",Wrath of the Titans

For example, when Perseus retrieves Zeus's bolt, the fight was very difficult until he caught Ares in a headlock, and it just seemed too easy after seeing how much Perseus was being beat.The acting was fairly unconvincing, and the only actors that I think did their role well was Liam Neeson, Sam Worthington, and Ralph Fiennes. Speaking of Ralph (actor of Hades), I feel that he was way too easily swayed.However, I don't regret seeing the movie.

After watching this movie, I was left feeling unsatisfied. For one, the characters seemed to be very 2-dimensional. Everything that happens within the story does not seem to truly affect the characters, they seem to just live in the situation and then move on. Perseus was put into many situations which should have really hurt him, and yet he got over it fairly easily. For one, He fought the Minotaur, which, compared to the Greek myth should have put a greater toll on the character but Perseus just seemed to kill him and move on. Perseus was also threatened by Ares and yet, the fear seems to leave Perseus soon after the incident happen. This especial irked me because that was the reoccurring theme in the book. Overall, I liked the movie and the take that the directors took on Greek myths but I feel that they should have spent just a little more time on character development.",Wrath of the Titans

I was warned by many people that this movie was one of the worst things ever written and that I was going to hate watching it. I was surprised to find that it was not as they said it was going to be; it was worse! I found the creatures in the beginning to be just nothing more than a wild card thrown in just to make it seem a little bit more appealing. The chimera was disgusting to look at and nothing at all what I imagined it would be like at all. I figured it would much more picturesque and menacing at the same time. However, the cyclops' were pretty awesome and much more what I imagined. I thought Zeus was much too relaxed when he was being overthrown. I mean come on, your brother is basically throwing you into oblivion, I would be pretty mad. I thought they tried too hard with the comic relief from Agenor. He was a good jokester for a while but the act quickly became old and I grew bored with it.

It's light entertainment and often that's all that I need. However, this snorrer is just plain dull. Even seeing it in IMAX 3-D didn't help.The characters were dull; even the comic relief was dull! The only good notes in the thing was Liam Neeson and Ray Finnes (no surprise there) who have one or two good moments. Kudos also to Bill Nighy who has fun with his now patented goofy wacko character. Otherwise it's hard to have any fun with the rest of them. If Sam Worthington was any more wooden he'd win the Steven Boyd manikin award for acting. Who wrote this thing and what group of knuckleheads thought it would be a good idea to finance it? Save your money; save yourself. Wait for May.",Wrath of the Titans

I can't complain, I don't see the point why people hating on this movie, it was just a good movie. WHO THE HELL CARES IF SOME GIRL IS FIGHTING IN THE NEXT SEQUEL......................... I would say go hate on real bad movies and not on quality movies :/. oke here are some points I loved. - It looked very good - The monsters were just awesome - the story was a lot above average - I saw no bad things - I didn't really care if you saw other things than in Clash of the titans - It was just a perfect movieQuote: Go watch this movie, you will not regret anything!!!",Wrath of the Titans
271,ghandour-abdulaziz,Nothing like the Previous Sequels !,6,15 March 2014,"Despite the common controversy on the failure of the previous sequels of this movie , this one proved not to be as bad as its predecessors . This remake of the sequel was actually appealing whenever it came to visuals and effects ; however , the problem this movie had , along with the previous sequels was with the scripting .The movie takes place in ancient Greece , a time when the gods flourished and the titans and demigods roamed earth . Continuing from the previous movie , where Perseus , the movies main character , passes on an offer of immortality offered to him by his father , the head of gods Zeus , to live a normal life with his son as a fisherman . Later , his wife dies and he is left alone to raise his child .Years later , the walls of Tartarus begin to fall apart as Hades and Aries make a pact to betray the gods and awaken the fallen titan Chronos , who would not be able to strife without the powers of the mighty Zeus . Zeus is then captured by Hades in the underworld and then was taken to Chronos , who began to slowly drain his godly powers .Perseus then ventures on a journey to find the three god weapons with the help of queen Andromeda . Perseus then gathers the weapons and prevails in building the ultimate weapon with the help of the fallen god Hephaestus . Perseus then uses the weapon to battle the now rising Chronos in an epic battle of Titan and demigod , with the absence of godly powers . Perseus and his allies then prevail in defeating the mighty Chronos ; however , it was a costly victory as all the gods have died and were banished to eternity .The movie features a set of great actors such as Sam Worthington and Liam Neeson , who all were amazing assets that improved the flow of the storyline .The visuals of the movie were quite stunning , considering the great companies that were put together to assemble this movie ; however , once again , the script of this movie was a major letdown because of its cliché dialogue and lack of reflection on the past and future .Despite the script , the movie served to teach its audience a valuable lesson on how betrayal can cause problems even between family members and brothers ; it also shows how with great determination , comes great consequences and outcomes .All-in-All , the movie was far better than is predecessors and was actually quite amazing when it came to graphics and content . Many people would push back from watching this movie ; however , I strictly encourage people to watch the movie as it succeeds to convey a perfectly executed idea in 99 minutes .",Wrath of the Titans
272,rizaldi-ilman,not really good,3,8 April 2014,"I think this film is Boring..why Hollywood always inadequate for showing the power of a character.. in this film, Hades and Poseidon described like a normal human being with the light power that can crush rocks.. not enough.. because basically they are God.. a God that still walks as human? fight like human? and have a son that as strong as human.. oh come on.. Leonidas from 300 was stronger than that..please look at Japanese, when they are describing Greek Myth like Hades and the other Gods.. in anime film Saint Seiya - Lost Canvas.. the Gods really really strong.. they really cruel, despising on human.. thats the character that I wanted to see..not humanly weak God..And Fight scenes are so below my expectation.. lack of troops, God's fights seemed weak, Human and God seems equals.. the only good thing is only 3D effects..",Wrath of the Titans
273,mysticalanarchist,oh my titan balls....,3,15 July 2018,"Never has something been so poorly made, so badly executed, so terribly sick, that it seems someone became sick on the ground and decided to make a film out of it.
Watch it for Rosmund Pikes screenshots (the beauty) only or do not watch at all would be my recommendation for this sorry mess of an all over the place with no real atmosphere film.",Wrath of the Titans
