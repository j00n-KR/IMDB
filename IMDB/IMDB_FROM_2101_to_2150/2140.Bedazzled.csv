0,SnoopyStyle,Elliot annoying,2,19 December 2015,"Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is lovesick, desperate, oblivious, eager to please, lonely and a doormat. He works at IT support. His coworkers avoid him. He's obsessed with Alison Gardner (Frances O'Connor) but she doesn't know him despite being in the same company for four years. The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul.I really dislike Elliot right from the start. I wouldn't prank the guy but I can understand his workmates. I couldn't get away from him fast enough. Right from the start, this movie annoyed me and it never got me back. I find none of it funny. Brendan Fraser does a lot of fake makeup. However I never find any likability about his character. Even at the end, he goes nuts on his annoying workmates. From start to finish, I never like Elliot. I like the Devil more.",Bedazzled
1,jboothmillard,Bedazzled,6,24 June 2005,"This is quite an amusing comedy about the life of an ordinary guy who has his life changed. Ordinary and unpopular Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) does not have any real friends, and now he is in love with a work mate Alison Gardener (Frances O'Connor). He tells God ""I would do anything to have that girl"", and instead, he gets his wish from The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley). She says he has seven wishes (like seven deadly sins) if he sells his soul. He also has a dialler to phone 666 (the Devil's sign) if his wish isn't going the way he wants. Throughout, he wishes to be many different personalities, including (unintentionally) a powerful Spanish drug dealer, an overly-sensitive nature lover, a professional basketball player with a ""little"" problem, a great book writer who turns out to be gay and President Abrham Lincoln, all wishes certain to have something go wrong, it's the Devil, what do you expect? When he gets to his final wish he does not want it and he eventually gets let off after a non-personal wish. In the end, it turns out it is not Alison that he was to be with, but a lookalike with dark hair named Nicole (yes, it's still O'Connor). Also starring Orlando Jones as Daniel, Paul Adelstein as Bob, Toby Huss as Jerry and Gabriel Casseus as Elliot's Cellmate. It may be cheesy at times, and not have the biggest laughs, but it's still fun to watch. Good!",Bedazzled
2,ccthemovieman-1,'George Of The Jungle' Meets Satan,8,28 January 2007,"Here's a fun film with a number of good laughs. It is stupid? Yeah, in parts. Is the theology sound? Hardly, but there was more truth than fiction uttered in this film, believe it or not. Is the Devil made to look attractive? Well, yeah, I'd say Elizabeth Hurley is pretty attractive!The beginning is the best part of the film, and the end - with a dumb New Age message - is the worst. Along the way, the dumb Brendan Fraser's ""Elliott Richards"" learns some valuable lessons in his battle with the Devil. For selling his soul, so to speak, he gets seven wishes and we witness how he handles, or mishandles, these wishes. Much of it is pretty funny. Fraser is not a bad. He can play these goofy roles (i.e. ""George Of The Jungle"" and he can get serious and be effective, too, as in ""The Quiet American."")Overall, it's good lightweight entertainment. Don't expect much, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. At least, that's the way I found it.",Bedazzled
3,Tweekums,Liz Hurley is one sexy Devil,6,21 November 2016,"Elliot Richardson is not the most dynamic of protagonists; he is the sort of guy who tries too hard to be popular making him more annoying than likable and the woman he loves, co-worker Alison, is barely aware that he exists. Then one day he says he'd do anything if she would like him the next thing he knows a stunning woman, who claims to be the Devil, offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. He doesn't take much persuasion. Unfortunately while his wishes are granted they aren't quite granted how he'd hoped; for example he wants to be rich, powerful and married to Alison he becomes a drug lord, she is having an affair and hates him. The other wishes are similarly disastrous and ultimately he realises that perhaps making selfish wishes isn't a good way to get what you want.Having not seen the original version I can't say how this compares. Brendan Fraser is decent enough as protagonist Elliot; unfortunately the character is neither particularly likable nor memorable. Liz Hurley stands out far more as possibly the sexiest version of The Devil on screen helped by costumes that show off her attributes without going beyond what is acceptable in a 12 Certificate film. The story is fun enough but very episodic; each wish leads to what is effectively a short sketch. There are enough funny moments spread throughout the film even if some of them are a bit obvious. The ending is a bit twee but not enough to spoil the film. Overall this was fun enough but not really a must see.",Bedazzled
4,BA_Harrison,"Get thee in front of me, Satan.",7,8 January 2016,"Elizabeth Hurley, still best known for her '90s relationship with Hugh Grant, and Brendan Fraser, star of Furry Vengeance, team up for this 2000 remake of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook's acerbic 1967 comedy Bedazzled: it sounds like a recipe for disaster, but even though the style of comedy is far removed from the original, Bedazzled 2000 succeeds in delivering its fair share of laughs, as well plenty of sexiness courtesy of Hurley.Fraser plays social pariah Elliot, who finds it hard to make friends and can only dream of a relationship with the apple of his eye, work colleague Alison (Frances O'Connor). When Elliot says that he would do anything to have Alison in his life, the Devil (Hurley) seizes the opportunity and offers the luckless loser seven wishes in exchange for his soul. What follows is a series of comedic episodes that see Fraser adopting numerous different guises, allowing the actor to surprise the audience with his versatility (Fraser is almost unrecognisable at times), while Hurley is predictably wooden, but distracts the viewer by slipping into several very sexy outfits for the connecting interludes.Of course, the devil being the devil, none of Elliot's wishes go according to plan, which leads to some very funny situations for the hapless dork, all of which are confidently handled by director Harold Ramis. This being a Hollywood film, it all works out well in the end for Elliot, who beats the princess of darkness at her own game thanks to his selfless heart, before finding love, not with Alison, but with her dorky doppelganger who just happens to have moved in next door.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for giving me the phrase 'small, wet, salty badges of emotional truth' and for Hurley's amazing array of hotter-than-hell get-ups, which include sexy nurse, sexy traffic warden, sexy cop, sexy teacher, sexy cheerleader, sexy bikini, sexy angel, sexy lawyer, and, in the deleted 'rock star' scene, sexy maid.",Bedazzled
5,paul_haakonsen,The Devil's trickery...,6,21 January 2016,"I haven't seen the 1967 original version of ""Bedazzled"", so I can't compare this 2000 version re-make to the original. With that in mind, I can say that this 2000 version is actually a fun and entertaining movie.The story is about Elliot (played by Brendan Fraser) whom is an overlooked guy desperate for attention and acceptance. When he runs into a very charming woman, who turns out to be the Devil (played by Elizabeth Hurley), he is given 7 wishes by trading his soul to the Devil. Can Elliot manage to find happiness, love and respect through his wishes? What works for ""Bedazzled"" is the hilarious situations that Elliot ends up in through means of his wishes, as the Devil tends to put a wicked twist on each wish, resulting in something other than what Elliot had hoped for.The cast were doing their part to make the movie work. And the two lead parts as played by Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley had great chemistry together and they both lifted up the movie quite well. Brendan Fraser was well-cast for the role of a dweeb character. While Elizabeth Hurley was no menacing Devil, she sure had the charm and sales pitch to pull off the role. And the supporting cast of Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein and Toby Huss were also hilarious in their various roles throughout the movie.Director Harold Ramis had a great sense of comedy touch and ""Bedazzled"" bears witness to that quite well.""Bedazzled"" is a fun movie and a movie that can be watched more than once. I am rating it a solid six out of ten stars. If you enjoy comedies, then ""Bedazzled"" is worth sitting down for 93 minutes to watch.",Bedazzled
6,Quinoa1984,Not as good as I thought,6,24 October 2000,"Harold Ramis' Bedazzled wasn't as I expected, and I don;t mean that in a totally good way.  The plot follows the 1967 version somewhat as a goofy yet charming computer geek (Brendan Fraser who makes this film almost watchable) who wants a girl more than anything.  So, he meets the devil (played by a somewhat miscast Liz Hurley) who will give him 7 wishes, for one soul, but unfortunately, each one backfires (even if each one has a couple of laughs). Overdone too much and while there are some good parts, they are overshadowed by an overall bad quality.  Which is unfair coming from the comic veteran Ramis (of National Lampoon, Animal House, Vacation, Stripes, SCTV, Ghostbusters, Groundhog's Day and Analyze This fame). C+",Bedazzled
7,wes-connors,The Devil Is in The Details,4,23 May 2009,"""The Devil's never been so hot or hilarious! Brendan Fraser is a hapless, love-starved computer technician who falls prey to sinfully sexy Elizabeth Hurley when he agrees to sell her his soul in exchange for seven wishes. But the sly Princess of Darkness has more than a few tricks up her sleeve. And before you can say Fire and Brimstone, Elliot's life becomes a hysterical hell on earth,"" according to the DVD sleeve. The best thing that can be said about ""Bedazzled"" is that Ms. Hurley is, indeed, as hot as hell.This is a comedy version of Faust's legendary deal with The Devil. In return for Fraser's soul, Hurley grants him seven wishes. These are played out in repertory company-style sketches. Instead of making me laugh out loud, they made me think: Where did Mr. Fraser lose his eyeglasses? Why would kissing Frances O'Connor suddenly make you remember you are gay? Why would being President Lincoln be a good way to meet babes? What brand of cigarette does God smoke, and can an Angel get hooked? **** Bedazzled (10/19/00) Harold Ramis ~ Brendan Fraser, Elizabeth Hurley, Frances O'Connor",Bedazzled
8,Hey_Sweden,Pleasant if unremarkable comedy.,6,24 December 2014,"Elliot (Brendan Fraser) is a nerdy office drone who his co-workers try to avoid as often as possible. He adores another of the employees, Alison (Frances O'Connor), and more than anything would really like to be with her. One night, a sinfully sexy Satan (Elizabeth Hurley) comes to him with a proposal. If he promises to sell his soul to her, she'll grant him seven wishes. He wishes for some of the obvious things - wealth, prosperity, knowledge, physical prowess - but she's sneaky enough to give all of the various scenarios an unfortunate catch.As co-written and directed by the late Harold Ramis, this 21st century update of the fondly remembered Dudley Moore / Peter Cook comedy never generates any great comedy fireworks. At its best, it's just sort of mildly amusing. It can't really sustain itself for a full hour and 33 minutes, with the more entertaining gags weighted near the beginning. At least it espouses some reasonable themes about selflessness and the idea that life is what we make it.What really drives the 2000 version of ""Bedazzled"" is an engaging star duo. Fraser, who'd proved his comedic chops in the past, does his able best to sell the material from sequence to sequence. You could say that he gives 110%. Hurley is extremely enticing, especially with the constant costume changes. She looks especially fetching in the cheerleader and cop outfits. O'Connor is perfect as the object of Frasers' desires, while the supporting cast - Miriam Shor, Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, Toby Huss - gets to strut their stuff in multiple roles. Ramis casts his repertory player Brian Doyle-Murray as a priest.Overall, this is likable but never really inspired.Six out of 10.",Bedazzled
9,lastliberal,Do you think your mommy and daddy just made me up so you'd be a good boy?,6,31 August 2008,"If Satan really did look like Elizabeth Hurley, I would probably sell my soul too. I enjoyed this comedy the first time I watched it, and I revisited it because I knew it was worth another viewing.Now, I am not a big Brendan Fraser fan, but he was perfectly cast for this role. He was the perfect dupe for the slick Hurley, who always looked absolutely fantastic in every appearance.The make-up and costuming were marvelous, and the movie was truly funny throughout. Wow! A comedy that is continuously funny. How rare.Although his part was small, I really enjoyed Gabriel Casseus in the cellmate/angel role.",Bedazzled
10,zardoz-13,"""Bedazzled"" proves great comedy need not offend to entertain.",9,13 July 2007,"""Bedazzled"" proves great comedy need not offend to entertain.Writer & director Harold Ramis, who co-starred with Bill Murray in the ""Ghostbusters"" movies and called the shots on last year's crime comedy ""Analyze This,"" surpasses himself with this frothy, first-rate, Faustian fable about a love struck lad who sells his soul to the Devil to win the heart of his dream babe. Not only does ""Mummy"" hero Brendan Fraser deliver a hilarious, Oscar-caliber comic performance, but also he displays his incredible versatility as an actor, impersonating a wide variety of sympathetic nincompoops, including a goofy NBA superstar, a gay literary sensation, a mustached Colombian drug lord, and a hopelessly sensitive guy. Sexy Elizabeth Hurley relies on her devilish charms as ""the Barbra Streisand of evil"" to tempt Fraser and does her best to sabotage his plans. The chemistry sizzles between Fraser as the disaster-prone dweeb and Hurley as titillating temptress. ""Bedazzled"" benefits from intelligent, witty scripting, top-drawer thesping, and Ramis' inspired helming.As a cubicle-confined, computer-support technician at a huge, faceless corporation, Elliot Richards desperately struggles to fit in with his office cohorts who feel nothing but contempt for him. Worse, shy, lonely, immature Elliot has idolized from afar for four-and-a-half-years a gorgeous co-worker, Allison Gardner (Australian actress Francis O'Connor of ""Mansfield Park""), who doesn't know he exists. When he catches his callous office mates at an after- hours bar, they get rid of him by goading him into striking up a conversation with Allison. Meantime, as the Devil searches for her next victim, she overhears Elliot say he ""would give anything to have that woman in his life"" as Allison dismisses him without a second thought. Presto, the Devil materializes in a red cocktail dress and offers Elliot ""seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddly little soul,"" so Allison will find him alluring. Basically, ""Bedazzled"" unfolds as a series of funny episodes with Elliot changing from one character to another to woo Allison. No matter how many times Elliot reinvents himself, he always finds a loophole he overlooked and discovers that the Devil is out to sabotage his best laid plans. When he requests wealth and power, the Devil turns him into a cuckolded ""Scarface"" wannabe, and when he asks to be the emotionally sensitive guy Allison yearns for in her diary, the Devil makes him so sensitive he cannot control his tears and alienates Allison. Scenarists Larry (""Tootsie"") Gelbart, Peter (""My Fellow Americans"") Tolan, and Ramis have penned arguably the year's most sophisticated and insightful comedy with clever dialogue and wacky-things-can-only-get-worse complications. Moreover, this wish-fulfillment farce boasts a lesson that goes hand-in-hand with its laughter. Ostensibly, Elliot learns he should be satisfied with his own unique identity and refrain from trying to be somebody else. ""Bedazzled"" qualifies as another top-notch comedy Harold Ramis can add to his resume that includes ""Stuart Saves His Family,"" ""Multiplicity,"" and ""Groundhog Day.""",Bedazzled
11,Boba_Fett1138,It's fun!,7,8 November 2005,"This movie is a delightfully, simple, fun one. It's a good modern Hollywood update of the 1967 British movie with the same title starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook.The movie is perfectly written by Harold Ramis who puts some good and fun typical Ramis dialog in the movie. The movie consists out of several separate sequences that are all totally different. Every wish brings us to another world and another Elliot Richards, the main character played by Brendan Fraser. The first wish, where he becomes a Columbian drug lord is the best sequence. Unfortunately after that the movie never becomes as good as that but it's still fun enough all to regard this a good and successful comedy.Elizabeth Hurley is perfect as the devil, with the emphasis on perfect. She plays her role with lots of profession and class and looks better than ever. Brandon Fraser shows his comical skills and he plays a diversity of different character but he plays them all very well and is good and believable as every character.The movie most certainly isn't the best or most memorable comedy but it simply is great fun to watch. It doesn't make ""Bedazzled"" a must see but it certainly is a perfectly watchable movie for perhaps on a rainy afternoon.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bedazzled
12,anaconda-40658,Satan Must Have Tampered With This.,5,19 December 2015,"Bedazzled (2000): Dir: Harold Ramis / Cast: Brendan Fraser, Elizabeth Hurley, Orlando Jones, Frances O'Connor, Brian Doyle- Murray: Title represents disbelief when expectations are not met but it falls short on its knowledge of Satan. As played by Elizabeth Hurley he is likable particularly when Hurley expresses affection for Brendan Fraser in the conclusion. Satan loves nobody and delights in seeing humanity fall apart. When a female co-worker ignores him he says he would give anything to have her. Hurley appears and willing to grant three wishes in return for his soul. Deceit infects plans as when he asks to be rich and she turns him into a drug lord. Conclusion is no surprise with bogus setup and repetitious storytelling. Inventive directing by Harold Ramis but this is a set back in comparison to his Caddyshack, Groundhog Day or National Lampoon's Vacation. Fraser is funny and given challenging material as he struggles to find the catch to each wish. Hurley gives faults impression of Satan in the film's biggest flaw. Frances O'Connor as the fixation is seen in different setups for which wish Frasrer makes. Orlando Jones is also featured in this visual lunacy. This is not a pleasant comedy like some of the other ventures that Ramis has done. The Bible teaches that in God's presence Satan flees, which is what viewers should do at the screening. Score: 5 / 10",Bedazzled
13,whpratt1,Elizabeth Hurley was a Hot DEVIL!!,10,18 February 2004,"This film was very entertaining and lots of laughs, and you can hardly be critical of a film which is meant to be UNBELIVEABLE!!! Stories about the devil and the wishes he or she grants is always an eye catcher, the struggle between Good & Evil.  Elizabeth Hurley (The Devil),""Bad Boy"",'02 was very sexy as a devil and almost kept Brendon Fraser(Elliot Richards),""Monkey Bone"",'01 from meeting his true love Francis O'Connor,(Alison Gardner),""Book of Love"",'04.

But I thought this ""Bedazzled"" was very good. Elizabeth Hurly makes a great devil. She's sexy, funny, and intelligent. Brandon Frasier does a good job as well with his stereotypical roles. Caveman, tough guy, and now a nerd. Nothing oscar material. But he always does his best, despite that I think he'll never get out of these roles. ""Bedazzled"" has some funny moments. I would recommend this if it's a rainy day. Other than that, it's nothing too special you'd make time for. But I would recommend it.7/10",Bedazzled
15,=G=,Hurley and O'Connor in the same movie? There must be a God!,7,17 May 2001,"""Bedazzled"" tells of a tech support geek (need I say more?) who sells his soul to the devil (Hurley) for seven wishes which he attempts to use to get close to a girl at work (O'Connor). The flick is a situational comedy which takes the audience on a fun ride as Fraser's wishes turn him into one exaggerated comic-book-type caricature after another. A cute flick sans slapstick, pratfalls, and jokes, ""Bedazzled"" offers lots of outrageous situations, some sentimental moments, and a whiff of philosophy. A fun watch with a cute ending, lots of eye candy for the guys, and Fraser doing what he does best playing a big, naive, smiling guy.",Bedazzled
16,Red-Barracuda,Fraser is funny and Hurley is sexy as hell. What more do you want?,8,21 December 2016,"This Harold Ramis movie is a remake of a 60's cult movie which I have never actually seen. It's based on the Faust legend where we have a terminally annoying man who is in love with a girl who works in the same office as him but who barely knows he exists. After a humiliating encounter with her he inadvertently casts up the devil who grants him seven wishes in his quest to win the girl over. The set-up in this one results in a film with a very episodic structure. With the central character wishing to be different in various ways which leads him to be reincarnated as a South American drug lord, a man intensely in touch with his sensitive side, a colossal basketball player, a respected writer, and the President of the USA. The fun comes from the fact that the devil has sneaked in a catch to every new persona and this inevitably leads to disasters for the central character and some hilarity for us. And that's the thing, it's actually a genuinely laugh out loud funny movie on several occasions, some standout moments being the over-sensitive man unable to avoid crying at a sunset or the half-witted giant basketball player who can't seem to string a sentence together without saying 'pretty good' while sweat literally pours from his head. Brendan Fraser is key to the comedy here. He puts in a genuinely good comic turn in a role that allows him to play a variety of characters with the help of some amusing make-up.So far so good. But I thought I would devote the whole final paragraph to the actual best thing about Bedazzled and that can be described in two words - Elizabeth Hurley. Honest to goodness, her performance as the devil is so incredibly seductive its bordering on being criminal. This astronomically gorgeous woman pops up throughout the course of the movie in an array of mind-bogglingly provocative costumes (proving conclusively that it isn't just gay men who can appreciate excessive costume changes). Hurley puts in an extremely sexy performance without stripping off at all which was quite an achievement all things considered. I really like girls with English accents and Hurley's posh voice was simply the icing on this particular cake for yours truly. She isn't a gifted actress but she does all right with comedy roles and this one, needless to say, suits her down to a tee in every conceivable way. Despite its other good qualities, if you made the decision to watch this film for the sole reason of watching our Liz in full throttle, I would understand.",Bedazzled
17,cherold,painful,2,17 September 2008,"Wow, there are people who actually find this funny? To be fair, I didn't make it too far through this one, so maybe something funny happens eventually. First you see Fraser playing an unlikeable loser, which is more sad than funny. The devil turns up, acts outrageous but not funny, so I figure, maybe it gets better when we get into the wishes. So I fast forward to the first wish, and there's a long thing about Fraser discovering he can speak Spanish which isn't remotely funny. So I fast forward through that to an inept version of a gag from the first movie. Then there's Fraser as another annoying unfunny character. Then I gave up.So maybe the rest of it is brilliantly funny. But I doubt it.First off, while Fraser is a very charming light comedic actor, I don't think he's any good at this Saturday Night Live-style character sketch comedy. He's not funny, he's just annoying.Even if I hadn't seen the original film I would consider this abhorrent, but it's also striking how this film changes things in ways that are inevitably worse. In the original, the Fraser character, played by Dudley Moore, was shy and awkward and miserable, but he wasn't someone you felt you wouldn't want to be trapped in a room with. Fraser plays the role as an insufferable bore with no redeeming qualities.As for Hurley's version of the Devil, well, it's the sexy bad girl thing, a concept of Satan a guy would get after striking out with a hot girl in a bar. The original movie's devil, Peter Cook, was a very distinct and well thought-out character, a friendly bloke fond of cruel practical jokes who acted like the best friend Moore so needed. And Cook's performance was sharp and brilliant. Hurley doesn't seem to have thought anything about what the Devil would be like, she's just concerned with seeming sexy and a little bad. It is weak on its own; compared to Cook's performance, it is pathetic beyond description.But I want to emphasize again that I am not saying this is a terrible movie compared to the original. This is a terrible movie compared to other comedies of this and every other era.",Bedazzled
18,bowmanblue,Not as bad as it could have been,8,11 October 2015,"For most people, the conversation goes like this... 'Have you seen Bedazzled?' 'No, what's it about?' 'It's got Liz Hurley in it.' That would be where the conversation normally ends. It's fair to say that Ms Hurley is hardly known for her acting abilities. And good reason for it. Yes, she's a pretty face, but her looks don't always translate to talent on screen. However, in Bedazzled, she doesn't come off too bad. No, no one ever said that her failing to win an Oscar for her role as the devil was a travesty, but the whole package is watchable enough if you're in the mood for something lightweight and frothy.Brendan Fraser is the star – playing a socially awkward geek who's desperately in love with a girl he works with. Naturally, he has no chance, until Ms Hurley (or the devil, but without the trident and horns) shows up and offers him seven wishes (for the minor price of his soul). He accepts and we're treated so a kind of extended clip show of what his wishes would be like. Of course, by dealing with the devil, nothing really goes how he would like.It's hardly deep and meaningful. Every time Fraser makes a wish, the devil makes it go wrong. Rinse and repeat. Yet it's still pretty good fun to watch. Fraser is as good as he ever is and naturally endearing for the role. Hurley still struggles to portray real emotion, even with the limited script she's given, but this is truly a case where her looks win us over. She really looks like the devil (might, if the devil was a hot woman) and so can be forgiven for her acting shortcomings.If you're in the mood for something daft and reasonably amusing to watch together on the sofa, this is definitely worth an hour and a half of your time. I wouldn't say buy it on Blu-ray and keep it forever, but if you're in the right frame of mind, it's not a bad way to waste time.",Bedazzled

20,slightlymad22,Hurley in a school girl uniform is only lasting memory,6,9 August 2014,"In Bedazzled (A remake of the 1967 Dudley Moore & Peter Cook movie of the same name) Elliot (Brendan Fraser) is granted 7 wishes by The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) so he can win the woman of his dreams, in exchange for his soul. Brendan Fraser seemed to have been around forever without making an impact in anything till ""The Mummy"" but as shown there, he is a very capable leaving man. Despite the fact it had been 13 years since her acting debut I still think of Hurley as the girlfriend of Hugh Grant. Who stole all the media attention at the premier of his movie Four Weddings and a Funeral in ""that"" black Versace dress held together with gold safety pins. I'd only seen her in the first ""Austin Powers"" movie and as the media hungry man eater in EdTv. (Art imitating life, if I have ever seen it) but here her acting is OK, and she is very attractive (especially when she dons a school girls uniform) probably, the most attractive I have seen her. None of the rest of the cast were memorable or stand outs, including the woman of Eliot's dreams whose face and name I could by even remember an hour after the movie ended.It's a tad predictable, the devil doesn't play fair, the hero does some soul searching before his final wish, and it's all wrapped up nice and neatly at the end A pleasing way to spend 90 mins, but I doubt I'll have a real desire to revisit the movie ever again.",Bedazzled
21,johnnyboyz,This doesn't really work for me,6,4 January 2004,"Bedazzled is a strange film. It's based on an office nerd who suddenly has a couple of wishes to play with after being granted that power by the devil. The nerd is played by Brendan Fraser who delivers quite a good performance early on but as the wishes progress, the performances decline. Hurley plays the devil and is now where near as good as she wants can be. We see her in a string of tight outfits which seems to be the main attraction of this film for some people and as the film progresses, her voice and acting just becomes unbelievably annoying and poor. The film reaches its climax and the content just couldn't get any more cheesy. The script is predictable and all though the wish element is fun at first, you can see its just one long, pointless joke nearer the end as he becomes president of America and just the speed at which the later wishes are dealt with adds to the utter farce and stupidity of it all.I suggest you avoid this one.",Bedazzled

Honorable mention: the jail cell scene.",Bedazzled
23,Anonymous_Maxine,A crash course in wish making.,6,11 July 2001,"Okay, we all know that this re-make was made for no other reason than as an excuse to get Elizabeth Hurley into some ridiculous number of skimpy outfits, so there's no need to discuss that here. It's just a given. Brendan Fraser plays the part of a painfully geeky guy that gets no respect at the office and has a lonely life because he is so hopelessly nerdy, until one day when he shows up uninvited to the brewery to hang out with his work buddies and runs into the tremendously sexy Devil. She offers to grant him seven wishes (it just seems like a good number) in exchange for his useless little soul. And of course, there is a substantial romantic element to the story, which is universal for movies like this. Anytime you have a total dork like Elliott Richards (Fraser) in a movie, there is ALWAYS a girl that doesn't give him the time of day but with whom he works magic during the film.And now the nonsense begins.Elliott obviously starts off with all of the clichés  I want to be rich, powerful, married to Allison (the girl that doesn't ever notice him), yada yada yada. Being granted by the devious Fallen Angel, of course, all of Elliott's wishes seem great at first but then soon go horribly wrong, which leads to the dumbest thing about the whole film. After returning from each wish (by dialing `666' into a pager that the devil gave him and that has 9 other useless numbers on it), he regroups, comes up with a tremendously over-compensated wish, and then tries again, only to have everything go wrong again. The obvious question is this, why didn't Elliott use any of his wishes to modify his previous wishes, rather than just starting all over and hoping all goes well? He seems like a smart enough guy, however unpopular he is. You would think it would be easier to just say I wish that Allison was married to me AND loved me, and that I was not a Colombian drug lord (and by the way, Elliot, specify your desired profession, you ARE dealing with Satan here). Can I say something here? My father is an immigrant from Colombia, and the portrayal of the super powerful Colombian drug lord in this film is completely untrue and very disturbing. Clearly, the production team for Bedazzled was too dim to realize this, but Colombia is a third world country, and what you have there is a lot of poor farmers who are harvesting some crop to feed their families. It's AMERICANS who are spending billions of dollars a year to shoot this crap into our veins or snort it up our noses or whatnot. The drug lords aren't filthy rich Hispanics living in the jungle in Colombia, people, they're Americans living here.Despite the fact that the actual wish-making procedure in the film was just poorly presented, it made for some funny situations. The badly mangled Spanish-speaking portion of the film went on for WAY too long, but some of the later mishaps were pretty funny. I don't know why, but I just about fell off the couch laughing when those smart-ass guys came up and kicked sand at Elliott on the beach when he was the most emotionally sensitive man in the world (what kind of an idiot would wish for something like that, by the way?). Actually, that's the only funny thing that I can think of right now, but trust me, the move is not a total waste of time (it's still pretty dumb, though). Don't rush out to the video store for this one, but it's worth sitting through once.",Bedazzled
24,Vartiainen,Doesn't really live up to its potential,4,24 August 2012,"I kind of like the premise here. Usually movies are bound by their basic settings. If the movie starts with certain characters and tones, chances are that those basic building blocks will not change all that much throughout the course of the movie. Which is why I love adventure films so much as they're usually full of exotic locations, ever-changing situations and there's always something new to marvel at.The same principle applies here. The seven wishes granted to Elliot (Brendan Fraser) allow him to go through many different scenarios and locations, from Columbia to the 19th century America. The problem is that some of these scenarios brought by the wishes are not that creative and usually depend on a singular joke to be made. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. The first few wishes and the various problems that occur are pretty funny to follow and I found myself chuckling from time to time, but the novelty wears off pretty quickly. The scenarios don't repeat themselves that much, but when you know that Elliot still has wishes left to be used, you can pretty much expect that something will go wrong with the first six, which kills the excitement. All that is left is the wonderment of how the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) will screw up this particular wish for Elliot. Though admittedly the last few wishes manage to dust off the formula to a certain degree, but I still feel that the writers could have been a bit more creative. Of course this is a remake, but they already changed some things, like the gender of the Devil, so why not go a bit further.On the technical side of things, the three main actors (Fraser, Hurley and O'Connor) play their roles pretty convincingly and I enjoyed their performances. They weren't anything spectacular, but the comedic timing was there and I especially enjoyed Hurley's portrayal of the Devil as a vindictive, petty and mean-spirited, yet surprisingly sympathetic character. She was evil, sure, but the malice just wasn't there. It's her job to be evil, so she is. Strange take on the classic character, but for the purposes of the film, it actually worked quite well.Final thoughts: I cannot really find it in me to call this movie bad, though the rating I'll give it is quite low, mainly because it's just so cheesy and doesn't really explore its possibilities. It's still enjoyable if all you're looking for are some cheap laughs and a way to spend an hour and a half.",Bedazzled

27,meeza,COme On Watch This One You Little Devil!,8,1 May 2001,"`Would you give up your soul to the devil in exchange for seven wishes?' That is the question Brendan Fraser's character has to decide on at the beginning of `Bedazzled.' His answer is a quick `Yea! Baby!' When he sees that the devil is played by Elizabeth Hurley. Fraser is hilarious in his wish sequences that includes: a colombian drug lord, an extra sensitive romantic, a playboy writer, a way-too-big basketball player with all-too-small private parts, and the president of the united states (too bad for Fraser that he did not have sexual relations with that woman devil played by Hurley). This Queen Elizabeth reigns all over actresses in the looks department. She might not be the best actress around but who cares? Who sees films anyways for good acting? Sorry, I did not mean to say that- I guess the devil made me do it.  So dazzle yourself with `Bedazzled.' **** Good",Bedazzled

I thought that Alison (Frances O'Connor) was a beautiful lady... especially in the ball gown she was wearing during the wish where Elliot (Brendan Fraser) wanted to be an articulate writer. Also, I thought that Satan (Elizabeth Hurley) was a beautiful lady as well... especially in the sexy red dress she was wearing when she first appeared to Elliot. One of the quotes which amused me the most was, ""Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk."" That was really funny! In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent knock-out comedy to all you Brendan Fraser or Elizabeth Hurley fans who have not seen it. You're in for a good time and a lot of laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",Bedazzled
29,Spleen,Lacklustre,5,20 July 2001,"The credits include the following line: `special thanks to Stanley Donen'. For what?  Not complaining?  If this film hadn't been released, Donen's original ""Bedazzled"" might have been re-released, and I might have got a chance to see it.  I'm sure it's better.Peter Cook's devil in the original was (by all accounts) not just a plot device, but a character.  Elizabeth Hurley's devil is no more than a granter of wishes and a changer of costumes.  All the same I think I preferred her to Brendan Fraser, because I at least had SOME idea what kind of character she was meant to be playing.  She was playing the Devil.  She may not have had much personality, but at least she didn't CHANGE personalities whenever she changed costumes, as Fraser did.There's a scene at the end where Elliot (the Brendan Fraser character, the dupe) finally stands up to the office workers who had been making his life hell.  You can only buy that scene by forgetting the start of the movie. They didn't make his life hell - HE made THEIR lives hell.  He continually forced himself on all of them with his inane blather and his almost sickening craving to be accepted; and while they all loathed him, they were never openly rude or hurtful.  (Until the end, when one of them made fun of him simply so that he could be punished for doing so.)We're never sure if Fraser is meant to be a geek, a doormat, or an everyman. If he's meant to be all three at once, the script fails to establish this, either.  When he's thrust into strange situations it's never as funny as it might have been, since don't know where his reactions are coming from. Treat the disjointed story as sketch comedy, though, and it fares little better: the jokes aren't imaginative enough.  Take that opening sequence, in which the devil ""freeze-frames"" randomly chosen individuals and we see tags like ""good"", ""evil"" and ""drinks from the carton"".  Unfortunately, ""drinks from the carton"" is about as clever as it gets.",Bedazzled
30,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A standard production and nothing more or less,5,7 June 2020,"Hollywood through the decades has been fairly consistent in how it makes movies. Or at least, the more recent decades so it seems. The usual complaint is that studios keep remaking films and rebooting franchises from the past. Whether this be just to hit people with nostalgia who know the original(s) already, or to introduce a new generation to the story, the tendency for them to be successful is very unlikely. No matter the case, it happens all the time. Perhaps what's more disappointing is when the end result is middle of the road. If it's good, it's something people will talk about. If it's bad, it's possible even more people will talk about it. However, for this film, it's just average, which makes it forgettable at best.The plot is about an insecure man by the name of Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) who tries to be friendly, but only comes across awkward to his co-workers Dan (Orlando Jones), Bob (Paul Adelstein), Jerry (Toby Huss) and Carol (Miriam Shor). One night after running in with them at a bar, Richards sees Alison (Frances O'Connor), a girl he is very interested in. When he realizes he will be avoided after he tries introducing himself, he asks god for ""anything to have that girl in his life"". This leads to the entrance of the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley), legitimately the devil. There Richards is given the proposition, to sell his soul to the devil in exchange for seven wishes of anything desires. Of course, that may come with some strings attached, of which Richards may not be thinking of.Written by Peter Tolan (Analyze This (1999)), Larry Gelbart (Tootsie (1982)), and Harold Ramis (Ghostbusters (1984)), the script for this remake is nothing to be bedazzled over. The story itself is one that has been depicted before - the nerdy and ignored protagonist can't seem to cut a break. Only to find something that sounds better than it really is. Audiences enjoy seeing the underdog being given a chance at redemption. Here though, it seems all too easy to know the execution of the story. It's a story that tries to push boundaries by adding more sex appeal with the change in the devil's gender, but all it does is come across half invested. This is unfortunate seeing that Ramis also directed this movie.Not to mention that this film draws similar parallels to that of another one of Ramis' films from earlier, that being Groundhog Day (1993). While Fraser's character doesn't fumble over the same day again and again, he instead makes several wishes not realizing the impending side effects. This is majority of the comedic elements of the film. And while at times it produces a chuckle here and there, it is not that clever either. Sometimes the coincidences that occur throughout the story are truly just eye rolling. As the old saying goes, ""what are the odds""? The odds are just about the same as Elliot Richards' colleagues also being by his side in every wish that he makes as well. What can be said is that the actors do try, with Fraser and Hurley doing their best with the material given.There's even appearances from Brian Doyle-Murray and Gabriel Casseus. The visuals are okay for the most part, but when CGI does get involved, it isn't very good looking. The cinematography shot by Bill Pope was competently handled. Being that Pope had also worked on Darkman (1990), Army of Darkness (1992) and The Matrix (1999), it's no surprise that his talent remains consistent here too. For music, the film score was composed by David Newman. However, since this is a comedy, much of the score is not audible as much of the comedic elements are replaced with other songs from other artists. Most notably Tone-Loc's Wild Thing, which is the theme for Hurley's portrayal as the devil. Adequate, but lacks character.As a remake is isn't bad, but it's not decent either. Coming from Harold Ramis, it would seem this would work out well. Instead, the music, special effects and execution of the plot is average. The plus side is, the actors do perform as best they can and the cinematography is well shot. But it's not memorable.",Bedazzled
31,raulfaust,What a nice find,8,4 August 2013,"Well, I start this reviewing saying how much I enjoyed this movie. ""Bedazzled"" has a very original story, in which a loser signs a contract with the devil in order to gain 7 wishes-- that are actually a curse in disguise. One thing to congratulate is the extremely professional way that Brandan Fraser portrays some characters; an actor needs to be very careful to perform such imitation. At some points I thought the story would go into a creepy stuff, and happily it didn't-- that wasn't the point of the movie afterall. It's also great that writers didn't appeal to any religion or lack of religion, allowing every kind of spectator enjoy this without feeling insulted.

38,jhclues,Hurley And Fraser Dazzle,7,5 November 2000,"A crash course on how to beat the Devil, or Faust played for laughs; however you want to look at it, `Bedazzled,' directed by Harold Ramis, is a diverting comedy, easy on the eyes (courtesy of stars Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley), extremely palatable, and just funny enough to be satisfying.  Ramis delivers it all with a steady hand and a straightforward approach that, while the story is not entirely imaginative (deals with the Devil aren't exactly anything new, cinematically speaking), finds a comfort zone that works and manages to garner some good laughs along the way. Fraser is Elliot Richards, a friendless, lonely young man whose life begins to heat up when the Devil (Hurley) seeks him out and offers him a deal he can't refuse; it's seven wishes, any one of which will land him the girl of his dreams, co-worker Alison (Frances O'Connor), who after four years of working in the same building doesn't know Elliot exists.  For Elliot, who demurs initially, it's just too good to pass up, especially when the Devil convinces him that a soul is something that is entirely overrated. 	Fraser gets a chance to showcase his versatility as an actor here, as each wish lands him inside the skin of a different character.  It's an engaging performance, with characters all over the map that take Elliot through a comedic journey of discovery that ends with an epiphany of sorts, about happiness and where you find it.  But then there's this deal he made; is it too late?  Hurley turns in a good performance as the ultimate seducer; it's not difficult to believe that a guy like Elliot could easily fall under her spell.  But what makes it so easy to swallow is that there's no attempt to make this out to be anything but what it is, which is fantasy played for fun.  It's obvious that Ramis knows his territory, and with the help of some clever, witty dialogue, he keeps a plot that is somewhat predictable fresh, and while it may not soar, he does keep the ship aloft and adds some nice touches, like the use of `dialogue bubbles' at the beginning of the movie to indicate some humorous traits of a number of randomly selected people from among the 6.2 billion that populate the earth. 	The supporting cast includes Miriam Shor (Carol), Orlando Jones (Dan), Paul Adelstein (Bob), Toby Huss (Lance), Gabriel Casseus (Elliot's cellmate) and Brian Doyle-Murray (Priest).  Perhaps not one of the more memorable films of the year, `Bedazzled' nevertheless is pleasant entertainment that provides some chuckles and even a bit of a moral.  All in all it's good comedy that stays above much of the base fare being offered today; it's a fun movie that works, and well deserving of a look.  I think you'll be glad you stopped by. I rate this one 7/10.",Bedazzled
39,Stampsfightclub,An enjoyable evil comedy,8,22 September 2006,"When looking at the poster and the title the connotations of the film are pretty simple, a film about a confused person who is under the control of an evil devil, but never did I ever expect it to be as good as it was. Brendan Fraser (George of the Jungle, Crash) stars as ugly geeky suck up Elliot and from the very start you can tell the whole film is centred around him and his personality. With many films this narrative device is often a bad way to go for example Shallow Hal was focused solely on Hal and his own issues but this 2000 film from Ramis differs because it is more funny and intelligent. Fraser does well as the poor character Elliot and his relationship with Elizabeth Hurley (Austin Powers, Edtv) is outstandingly funny. The two act very convincingly in-front of the camera the whole was through and enjoy many memorable scenes together. Perhaps many stubborn people will argue that the story is too basic with not much to it, and they are correct to an extent. I believe this film is very good for what it is. It's a comedy fantasy romance film, you know what I mean. I believe this film had to be basic because audiences are therefore appreciative of the genre and the many different types of jokes involving Satan, sex, relationships and character personalities. It's a very understanding plot moving at a quick pace with very light-hearted scenes. The whole idea of having the devil as a woman was also an interesting concept as Elizabeth Hurley dressed in very attractive clothes and presented a very sexual iconography. Having stereotypes in the form of Propp's hero: Brendan, the geeky guy and Frances O'Conner who plays Alison acceptably as the goal for the lead character. There are many predictable jokes but this is one of those films which is enjoyable for what it is, a perhaps corny romantic comedy with different types of jokes and expressing views about the after life. I recommend this film for anyone who likes a consistent plot with funny characters who jokes about relationships. 8/10",Bedazzled

But Peter Scott and Dudley Moore turned this idea on its head and into an irreverent laugh-fest. It still routinely appears in repertoire theaters for midnight showings a la ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". So how to set your new version apart from the original?

As everything in life has a price, he's going to find out that eventually he must pay for his wishes and tries to revert the contract.It's a plot which overall sounds very interesting and appealing, but as you're about to find out, badly executed. The main actor acts as a retarded schoolboy and with every wish he has, he's put into very embarrassing situations from which he doesn't seem to understand anything. Instead of being funny and entertaining, it gets dull, boring and loses interest right from the beginning. Unfortunately for me, the finale isn't good either. Although pretty unpredictable in a way, it doesn't do much to save the overall impression of this movie which is not to be seen by anyone, regardless of reasons.It had a good idea but as it happens with many films, especially comedies, it fails miserably when it comes to putting it into action.

It has it's laughs and some of them are jokes taken verbatim from Moore and Cooke but the timing and crafting are off.

He repeats some of the jokes. In the original the shy Dudley Moore asks for a popsicle to prove the devil's powers, he obliges but only after taking a bus and making Moore pay for it. It is a gut bursting laugh because of the sheepish Moore. The joke doesn't work in the remake because of the remake's leads. Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Fraser think they are in a cartoon.If I had to place the blunt of the blame it would be on Hurley and the way the interpretation of the devil is written. Cooke's interpretation of the devil is dry and cynical and totally unimpressed with himself. He treats his job as if he were bored by it. This is funny. It makes the outlandish torment he inflicts all the more effective because it's loudness clashes so well with a dispassionate prince of darkness. Hurley is funny but there's nowhere she can really go with the character because she's so outlandish already. It doesn't really add anything making the devil female either because they don't play with the sexual attention you'd assume would be there. Fraser's Elliot is a boy scout.Brendan Fraser has a certain B-movie charisma but as a comedic actor he leaves a lot to be desired. I think he could have done more with the character but he plays some of the scenarios like Leslie Nielson-esque spoofs. For a Faust scenario to work we need to fear somewhat for our hero because we identify with him and kind of want him to get his wishes fulfilled. Fraser's rubber face antics are off-putting and don't get the laughs because there isn't any real sincerity. I didn't really think any of the wishes landed except for one brilliant sequence that plays exactly like the original film. I couldn't help but laugh when Fraser's wish to be President is granted when he becomes Lincoln at Ford's theater.For what it's worth I think the movie wraps up the story quite well when Elliot makes a selfless wish that saves his soul. It ends the story in a more convincing way than Cooke's original.",Bedazzled
51,FlickJunkie-2,Mildly amusing,6,3 March 2001,"This is an innocuous and mildly amusing remake of a 1967 comedy formerly starring Dudley Moore.  Since I haven't seen the original, I will comment on this film on its own merits.  The story is a lighthearted Faustian parody where a geek named Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) sells his soul to the devil (Elizabeth Hurley) in exchange for seven wishes.  Consistent with the maxim, `Be careful what you wish for', Elliot's wishes bring him numerous unintended and droll consequences.Harold Ramis has written and directed some classic comedies (`Animal House', `Caddyshack', `Ghostbusters', `Groundhog Day'), but this material comes nowhere near the standard set by his earlier films.  The film is a showcase for Brendan Fraser, who is funny, but not hilarious.Fraser's performance is hit or miss.  Some of his portrayals are very humorous and some fall flat.  He is better when he is playing the sincere buffoon than when he is trying to render some bizarre caricature.  Not much is asked of Elizabeth Hurley by this screenplay.  She needed to be beautiful, sexy and naughty, which isn't much of a stretch for her.  Frances O'Connor has an equally undemanding role as Elliot's love interest, being more of an object than an integral part of the film.  Some of the funniest performances are given by the supporting actors especially Orlando Jones and Paul Adelstein.This film is good for some light entertainment.  I rated it a 6/10.  There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",Bedazzled
52,LebowskiT1000,"Fun movie, good comedy.",9,8 February 2003,"No, this isn't the best or funniest comedy in the world, but I certainly enjoyed it.  There is a fair amount of really good comedy in the film to keep you entertained.  ...And of course there's Elizabeth Hurley...need I say more?The story is a fun one and quite the fantasy, but nonetheless, it's entertaining.  While not being anything terribly profound, this film definitely has a point to make, be happy with yourself and only you can make things happen, don't rely on others for your happiness.The acting in this film is very good.  Brendan Fraser struts his acting talent in this film quite nicely, playing virtually 5 or 6 characters throughout the film.  Brendan really is a talented actor and should get some notice for his role in this film.  Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss also deserve a great deal of notice for their work in this film, all three of them play various types of characters in the film and do it quite nicely.  Elizabeth Hurley and her ever-changing wardrobe should be reason enough for any guy to watch this film.  She looks nothing short of fantastic in every scene.  Frances O'Connor was a nice choice for the part of Alison / Nicole (also playing more than one role very nicely).All in all, this is a fun, cute movie with some really good comedy.  I would recommend this film to anyone that likes those types of film, or is just a fan of one of the actors or director Harold Ramis.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris",Bedazzled

Like the sensitive guy that crys a lot, the big basketball guy with a little weiner, the Spanish millionaire, the guy with the big penis but who was gay, and the abraham lincoln president. All of them were extremely funny but the best one is the sensitive guy who crys a lot. The songs he sang and the words he said to his girl was hilarious.

Very episodic indeed, but some of these episodes (the wishes) were very entertaining and none of them were boring. Too bad that the scenes in between weren't as fun to watch.Elizabeth Hurley has about as much acting talent as she has fat on her body, and it *so* boring to watch her trying to act. Brendan Fraser though, is great playing goofy characters like this one (look at e.g. the delightful romcom Blast from the Past).In short, Bedazzled is a good film. Nothing more, nothing less. (6/10)",Bedazzled
57,DavidSim240183,Hardly dazzling but not bad for a chuckle,5,6 November 2007,"There is a common theme that runs through Harold Ramis' films. That of people taking different directions in their lives, and seeing what possibilities are opened up as a result. Such as Groundhog Day. Bill Murray relived the same day endlessly and got to see how many variations he could get out of it. A superb comedy. Ramis' finest work. Then with Multiplicity, Michael Keaton was cloned several times, and a different person was created each time over.And now its Brendan Fraser's turn in Bedazzled, the remake of the 1967 black comedy. Fraser plays Elliot Richards, a socially inept tech support worker. This is a man who lives a horrible life. His co-workers head in the opposite direction the minute they see him on the horizon. Life seems determined to frustrate his every move. And worst of all, the love of his life doesn't even know he exists.Allison (Frances O'Connor) works with Elliot but he doesn't really register with her. And on the night she walks away from him, completely none the wiser to his feelings, he wishes to God Allison would love him as much as he loves her.And Elliot gets his wish. But not from God. From the other side of the cosmic tracks. The Devil himself. Or herself! The Devil (Liz Hurley) offers to give Elliot seven wishes. Wishes of his own choosing. He can be rich and powerful. Handsome. Intelligent. Anything he wants. The only thing she asks in return...is his soul.As soon as Elliot's used up his wishes, he's contractually obligated to sign over his soul to Satan. Since he's not really doing anything with it, he agrees. But every wish he makes backfires in some way, because he's a little careless with his phrasing. His life becomes more miserable now than it was before. And he's still no closer to wooing Allison.I've got to be honest with you. Bedazzled hasn't got much of a plot to it. Its gimmicky. Slight. And it's a one-joke film. Something that's becoming a worrying habit for Harold Ramis. I suppose Groundhog Day was a one-joke film, but the inspired casting of Bill Murray allowed it to transcend its origins and surpass all expectations. It instead became a comedy classic.But with Multiplicity, danger signs were beginning to show. The film's slight premise got out a reasonable amount of mileage for three quarters of the way through, and then stalled before the end. The downward spiral continues with Bedazzled.Elliot makes a wish. And then the Devil subverts it. There is always a catch. A sting in the tale. And gradually Elliot whittles his wishes away, bringing him one step closer to Satan's clutches forever.That's it. That's the film's structure. And each of Elliot's wishes follows the exact same pattern, unwaveringly. To the point that it becomes repetitive.The film is just about saved by Brendan Fraser, who brings his usual lunk-headed, good-natured affability to the character. Without him, Bedazzled wouldn't be worth bothering with.Fraser gets to show off a bit of range here. Because through every wish, he has to play a completely different version of himself. From a Columbian drug lord, to the world's most sensitive man, a lunk-headed basketball star, an articulate homosexual and even Abraham Lincoln.Fraser takes gags from the uneven screenplay and reworks them through his own charms. His use of the Spanish language sounds quite funny coming from him. Being a thickheaded NBA star comes naturally to him. Its a good thing Ramis had the sense to cast Fraser. This type of material is something he seems very in sync with.But I can't say the same of Liz Hurley. Nobody could ever accuse her of being a wonderful actress. She's downright terrible in just about everything she stars in, (although surprisingly she's never been nominated for a single Razzie award). She has zero charisma. No talent. Her delivery is stiff and wooden. And she's completely miscast in the role of The Devil.Granted she looks gorgeous. The film decks her out in a series of mini-skirts, catsuits and tanktops, but she never comes alive. The Devil should have been a comic whirlwind of mischief. And Hurley never gets off the ground. Roger Ebert put his finger right on it: ""She lacks abandon, risk and maniacal self-amusement.""He is so right. I know who I would have liked to see play The Devil. Claire Kramer. You may not know her, but she played the Hell God Glory in Season 5 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She played the part with all the reckless abandon she could muster. She's a wonderful actress. Hopping about with energy. A mischievous twinkle in her eye. And she looks great in a red dress. I can't imagine an actress more suited to the role of Satan.Hurley pales by comparison. Even when the screenplay provides her with witty puns, she has neither the delivery, nor the timing to make them fly. Like when Elliot asks her if there's a God: ""Yes there is. Most men think they're God. This one just happens to be right."" That line purred from the mouth of Claire Kramer would have been classic. From Liz Hurley's, its flat and unremarkable.And I hated the ending. The film arrives at a really contrived way to free Elliot from the contract. And he still gets the girl. Sort of. Its a weird ending, and left me feeling cheated for wasting my time on this film. A few chuckles here and there, but a big disappointment. Harold Ramis is really going to have to come up with something special soon. Otherwise his career will disappear faster than Liz Hurley's.",Bedazzled
58,AvidClimber,Bedazzled — Your basic comedy about the devil wishes gone awry,6,7 January 2013,"Bedazzled has a very simple premise and deliver a very simple comedy full of chuckles. Mix a sexy devil, a clueless anti-hero, some wishes gone terribly wrong, and voilà!It's funny, with each wish and consequences well devised. The dialogs are good and the script well thought out.Unfortunately, the movie over all feels a little cheap when you see it for the second time. It's not enough to stop me, but... What create that impression is that they reuse the same 5 actors to do different secondary characters. Also, some special effects are not as good as they could have been, and most scenes feel a bit empty. Lastly, Brendan Fraser's character is a bit too geeky at the beginning, but over doing it is a common flaw in Hollywood movies (as I've said many times).Still, it's worth seeing, especially if you like devil related comedies.",Bedazzled

Despite the obvious message and predictable end results, which any moron can figure out without watching this film, I come back to the ""Bedazzled"" every so often for Brendan Frasiers little parades and Elizabeth Hurleys sex kitten routine. This is a fun series of episodes that hit more often than they miss, which is something for remake comedies. The special effects seem to be tritely coordinated which was insulting, as was some of the over the top (and not funny) stereotyped humor involving the episode where our IT nerd is made into an intelligent homosexual. The basketball wish played out well, but our desired lady went completely juvenile in the penis references. For such a sexually driven movie, Harold Ramos certainly steered away from the vault of humor that could have made this a memorable comedy instead of a predictable gag film.",Bedazzled

Bedazzled is by the same director who directed Groundhog Day. Its one of those movies which only needs an idea to be a hit and succeeds in doing so. The film is narrowed down to an episodic series of sketches which are each as amusing as the next. Liz Hurley shines in her over-the-top performance as the devil. Brendan Frasier is much better in Bedazzled than he was in The Mummy Returns. The film takes a look at the lighter side of the devil and life. To sum it up, Bedazzled is a good idea which is smoothed out to make a great movie. 7.3 out of 10.",Bedazzled
62,tributarystu,A pleasant surprise,7,16 March 2003,"Bedazzled...enchanting title. Upside down story...one might sight something like ""anti-stereotype"" characters. It is so, I will not deny that. But these are not the ""strong"" points of this movie. You will have to look somewhere else to realize what this movie actually has to say.SPOILERSAs I said, the story is upside down: the devil, a very attractive lady interpreted by Elizabeth Hurley, meets a desperate guy, Elliot, who is deeply in love with a woman, called Alison. In his apparent desperate cause he accepts the devil's proposal to sell his soul for seven wishes. Despite what looks as an ""ideal to become"" life, the devil shows it's true face while fulfilling each of the wishes.Although the story might become boring for some, it really held me to my seat. I've actually seen it three times and I always had the chance to laugh, and most important of all to have the same feeling at the end of the movie. I was kept interested in what would happen next...what would happen wrong in a wish. The ""mixing"" was absolutely hilarious at times and this fact makes me affirm that this is a great comedy. The important thing is that laughing is not all there is to this movie.People might be a little outraged by how the devil was portrayed, but I say it was all done this way for ""the show"". An ""anti-stereotype"" would be the black savior( most certainly an angel in my opinion) who has an important, though short, part in the story. We can notice in each ""wish"" that Elliot's life is still influenced by the same people as in his real life. One might conclude after pondering on this fact that change doesn't come from the world around us, but change comes from within us. That is the message of this movie. It's not that important for the world to form itself regarding our wishes, but what is  of any relevance is the fact that we understand that many things in life don't came that easy. As Elliot comes to the conclusion, one can not wave a magic wand so that all things become as desired by an individual.This film conquered me through its charm and the way it actually sends us an important message. It's not even that much that the viewer has to really sense the message because we get it told right into our ears.
No movie is perfect though, but this one scores high where it has to. It's entertaining, the actors are, generally, funny and their actions and reactions believable and it has A MESSAGE. If anything in life doesn't have a real purpose, that is if a work of art doesn't have a real purpose and doesn't carry a message, then it can often be a waste. There is of course a difference between the delight of the human eye and the delight of the human intelligence. Anyone can see that. I would dare to say that this movie offers both delights. If there ever were a comedy I would recommend it would be this one. It makes you laugh, it makes you think and it makes you feel good. What else can you ask for from a good movie? Not much in my opinion. There are few movies which carry you into a state of exaltation at their ends, and, at least in my case, this was one of them. This film earns, in my opinion, a well deserved 8/10",Bedazzled

64,Jerique,A devilishly funny film!,7,28 July 2010,"Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley have incredible chemistry in an adaptation written by genius comedic writer Harold Ramis in this hilarious comedy about a lonely, desperate man (Fraser) who is enticed by the Devil (Hurley) to give up his soul for seven wishes.Frances O Connor co-stars as Alison Gardner. As Elliot struggles to win her affections with each following wish, the Devil finds clever ways to make us laugh and ruin Elliot's wishes.It's not necessarily the special effects, costumes or make-up that win you over. However, they are all top-notch and saves a ton of money re-casting new actors for each individual wish. The plot alone is just something so interesting in its own right. Plus, you add in the comedy and the chemistry, you've got a great film.There are a small amount of laugh out loud moments, but the movie is over run with small chuckles most of all. Elizabeth Hurley has never looked hotter and as a viewer, you're rewarded with a huge number of skanky outfits. She delivers each line with a sexy vibe that sends a tingle through your body.Brendan Fraser plays Elliot as desperate and pathetic perfectly. Other than Jay Burschel, I've never seen an actor pull of the role of awkward. Brendan can play it well and he's very versatile and shows it off.It's not exactly a movie for kids, but it's not entirely for adults. There is a scene of profanity and mostly mild profanes. There's not blood nor violence that is disturbing so it's mostly a family movie. I would recommend it to anyone to watch it, at least once.",Bedazzled
65,GirishGowda,Enjoyable Movie,5,27 November 2013,"Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is a socially awkward, geeky, over-zealous man working a dead-end technical support job in a San Francisco computer company. He has no friends and his co-workers are always avoiding him because of his banal and embarrassing attitude. He has a crush for more than three years on his colleague, Alison Gardner (Frances O'Connor), but lacks the courage to ask her out. After Elliot is again ditched by his co-workers, at a bar while trying to talk to Alison, he says to himself that he would give anything for Alison to be with him. Satan (Elizabeth Hurley), in the form of a beautiful woman, overhears him and offers to grant Elliot seven wishes in return for his soul. If his wishes weren't going the way he wanted, then he could give her a call by dialling 666. Obviously, it doesn't go his way.Brendan Fraser plays a Mexican drug lord, an overly sensitive guy who cries watching sunsets, a dumb basketball pro, a suave and smart gay gentleman and Abraham Lincoln among others. He brings some charm to his multiple roles which in another actor's hands would have been completely insufferable. But, there wasn't enough consistency in the writing where the laughs were few and far in between. It was fun to watch Elizabeth Hurley's Satan who was smoking hot and helped the movie from getting too boring. Her assortment of jobs involved a teacher, nurse, night club owner and others. From a prurient perspective as well as from an entertainment point of view, she was great and looked more like an embodiment of Lust rather than Satan. Though I do empathize with Elliot wanting the love of his life, one can't help but imagine how much more awesome it would have been to have Satan, especially one as ravishing as Elizabeth, as a girlfriend. Frances O'Connor doesn't have much to chew scenery with other than being the standard pretty girl here, though she did make me laugh with her 'I just want a guy who pretends to be sensitive' scene. The special effects are surprisingly not that bad. Bedazzled runs on a one note joke and it gets lame very fast.

Possibly because of all the widely divergent characters he is playing he is not truly great in any of them  though he is hysterically funny  due primarily to the superb script by Larry Gelbart (of television's M*A*S*H fame), Harold Ramis (who also directed) and Peter Tolan from the original screen play by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.The Devil's demons (which appear in nearly every scene in one form or another) are great supporting roles played by Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein and Toby Huss.  They provide just the right touch of devilish humour, charm and wit.  Another bit of casting genius and writing is Gabriel Casseus as Elliot's cellmate who expounds on the soul and is later seen playing chess with The Devil (who cheats, of course).In fact all of the supporting characters were perfectly cast and brilliantly executed.The script was so tight and well written that it was almost actor-proof.  It was even able to carry a moral message without slamming the audience in the head with it.To paraphrase an idea from the film you get out of life [and this film] what you put into it.This was an all-around good film with good direction, good jokes, good acting, excellent make-up (especially on Brendan Fraser by Ben Nye, Jr.) and a good yet unobtrusive score.

69,richspenc,A few amusing parts but a couple dumb parts too,7,7 March 2017,"There are good, a few bad scenes, and some copying from other films. Brendan is someone here who at first I wondered why he was such an outcast at work, but I started to see why after a few scenes. His co workers are definitely snobs but I started to see that when you're the kind of person who just cannot take a hint, and you keep leeching on to people no matter what they say, they will grow to dislike you. Also true in today's society that if you're always too cheerful and nice all the time, sadly people will start looking at that as bad. You need to show that you can sometimes be grumpy, critical, and a little bit of a jerk occasionally (just not too much) as well as happy and nice to make a whole picture look good to people on the social front. Brendan was also a doormat, and that's not good either. Brendan meets Elizabeth Hurly at a bar after being scorned by his co workers (seriously, I would've told them to go to hell if they kept treating me like that) and after failing to attract Alison, the girl he's been yearning for who has not been yearning for him back. Hurly is, bum bum bum bum, the devil, with a card to match. We get the whole charade of Brendan not believing her at first, her little visual tricks, and the sample wish, the big mac and coke (""I even had to pay for it"", Brendan whined) to start convincing him, then we get the contract and seven wishes speech (of course she doesn't mention then that one of the wishes has already been used up, the big mac and coke. That revelation comes later, with Brendan not taking it too well). Branden gets to work on his wishes and we get the twist of every wish coming with a big problem. There is a definite copying of both the 1960s version of Bedazzled and Twilight zone episode ""Man in a bottle"". The first wish is wishing to be rich, when is that not someone's first wish in a wishing movie. The Columbian drug lord was a nice touch, the film makers in that scene did a good job making Brendan look like a different kind of person, and taller. The wish has him married to Alison, but her not exactly turning out happy about it and cheating on him to be with suave jerk Raul. Wouldn't any hot Hispanic girl pick Raul over him over Raul. Then Raul takes over the business and orders Brendan killed. Brendan barely escapes out of that wish with his life. The ultra sensitive guy wish scene was hilarious, with the way he cried harder every time he saw that sunset (""when is that darn thing gonna set!?""). This scene (and the ending with Alison ditching the crybaby to hook up with the beach jocks) again goes with my point that a girl will like a nice sensitive guy if he has a limit to it and can sometimes be a bit of a jerk, and tough. I liked the inbetween wishes scenes with Brendan and Hurley. I liked the scene right after the sensitive guy wish with him pointing out to her that he sees how she's ruining his wishes, the lines from Hurly in the scene where she's an exceptionally easygoing teacher, the scene in Alison's bedroom (Hurly to Brendan: ""this is a place you would've never seen without my help""), and the scenes where they're arguing about how many wishes are left, and then where they're arguing about the last wish. There were a few not very good scenes though, such as the basketball wish (with Brendan flying through the air like that. Please. And his protrusive sweating was gross. And he says ""you gotta give 110%"" too many times.), the articulate wealthy guy scene is OK until the ending with the gay partner, and the Abraham Lincoln wish was stupidly made (Brendan looked ridiculous as Lincoln). That president wish was copied from Twilight zone ""Man in a bottle"" where the main character became Hitler (the character of that episode looked ridiculous as Hitler). There's also a copy from ""Oh God, you devil"" with Brendan going into the church and wanting to talk to God, the actual person, and then getting in trouble being considered crazy. ""Bedazzled"" all in all though was OK.",Bedazzled

I have to say though that the worst scene is the one where Fraser becomes a ""sensitive guy"" and turns into a wimpy fruitcake. Actually, almost every character he plays is painfully pathetic. You find yourself wondering how the next wish will screw him up, and hope you won't hate the character he becomes. But you will. 
Elizabeth Hurley cannot act. Not that she needs to in this movie, all she really needs to do is put on tight clothes and talk in her annoying accent. As hard as she tries, she is NOT sexy.There are hardly any good points I can make about this movie. I gave it a 2/10 for some reason, perhaps because it ended.",Bedazzled

Anything ?  Here comes the devil (Elizabeth Hurley) to offer him the oldest bargain ever written: the Faustian sale of his soul to the devil for his wish.  Only she gives him seven wishes (and her pager), and each of his wishes lends to some mildly funny results.  Such is the premise of Bedazzled, a remake to the 1967 comedy starring Dudley Moore, Peter Cook as the Devil, and Raquel Welch as Lust (who else ?) As a whole, Bedazzled is a disappointing movie.  To his credit, Brendan Fraser is an excellent comic actor, and he works hard throughout the film with his different looks and accents, and successfully embodies the physical comedy required.  Likewise, O'Connor is terrific and beautiful, and stands out in several scenes.  One of the problems, however, is the casting of Elizabeth Hurley as Satan.  While certainly beautiful, playful, and fun, this film needs a devil who is actually evil, and who could scare both Fraser and the audience.  In addition, while Bedazzled boasts Larry Gelbart and Harold Ramis as co-writers, it simply doesn't achieve its comic goals. Slightly better the average.Vote: 6",Bedazzled

He really pulls off doing all those characters, which gives the movie a more fresh feel. Each time he is a different person, whereas in the original he was the same guy and only thought himself as somehow different.  But other than that, this is just a poor remake of a great classic marketed for more laughs to make more money. Not really worth seeing except for Brendan Fraser. The original is still worth seeing though.",Bedazzled
81,FilmFan777,"Funny, Entertaining...The film as well as Brendan Fraser",8,8 July 2001,"I can take the good from what a film offers yet I really respect one that carries most if not all components to make an all around good film. This light hearted take on selling your soul is based on the 60's film with Dudley Moore yet Harold Ramis brings that distinguishable touch of his own, to make it his own. Beside the creative situations Brendan's character finds wishing himself into in exchange for his soul, the humorous script and good pace of the film, Brendan Fraser demonstrates again why for several years I've considered him one of the few truly talented actors today. From the meek and nerdy, to the suave intellectual, an overly sensitive dork to a happy go lucky drug lord, Brendan captures the true essence of every character he plays. Brendan has a true ability to facially express any emotion from pain to pleasure with convincing consistency. Slumped shoulders, ill confident bumbling steps or head high, shoulders wide with dauntless long strides, Brendan employs each detailed nuance needed to bring to life those he portrays. Be it The Godfather to Pet Detective...good acting is good acting. And the ability to convincingly portray characters as widely varied is truly a talent we don't see come around often. So at the very least, Bedazzled offers an example of those abilities as well as a good paced, well directed and written light hearted film ride you might consider enjoyingly worth your time. fc",Bedazzled
82,ogdendc,One of my guilty pleasures,9,6 August 2014,"This film is one of my guilty pleasures. You know, one of those films that you shouldn't really like but actually do. I guess it helps that I've always had a bit of a thing about Liz Hurley and her role here as the devil suits her perfectly, and her limitations as an actress don't really matter here.The other main character and another good looking woman is Frances O'Connor as Alison. She's lovely and a great actress here. In addition, Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss play a variety of characters very nicely.Brendan Fraser holds the whole thing together. He plays nerdy Elliot, who works with Alison though he is invisible to her. He says he would give anything to have her as a girlfriend. This is an invitation for the devil to offer him seven wishes in exchange for his soul... as long as he signs the contract.There follow five very funny cameos where Elliot takes different personas in order to win Alison. Each is doomed to end in failure. He asks to be (1) rich and powerful, (2) emotionally sensitive, (3) a famous athlete, (4) intelligent, witty and well-endowed, (5) President of the United States. Every scenario has a twist that he did not expect. The devil gives Elliot misleading advice in her own cameos between these scenes.Some reviewers have compared this version unfavourably to the Peter Cook & Dudley Moore version. It's best not to compare them. The films are sufficiently different to enjoy each one in its own right.There are many scenes here that are laugh-out-loud, even on a repeat viewing. If there's a weak point it's the final half hour. Yes it does sort of tie the whole thing together but the pace slows and it tries too hard for a 'happy ever after' finish. Maybe a darker ending would have been better. But overall, great fun, great dialogue and great acting.",Bedazzled

Some of the scenarios in which Fraser's character found himself are really very funny and work quite well at achieving their comic effect, even though a number of parts aren't all that funny or intelligent.The film is not without its valuable message, either, even though it is an ancient and very well-worn one. The whole point about simply trying to be who you are, not wishing for the world, riches, etc., is still relevant and meaningful, giving the film at least some additional depth.

He plays Elliot Richards, who at the beginning of the movie is a stepped-upon geek, annoying to his work colleagues and invisible to the love of his life, Alison (O'Connor). When he proclaims he'd do anything to be with Alison, the devil appears to offer him a deal.What follows is a string of scenes that mostly miss the mark, as the wily devil takes Elliot's wishes and twists them out of context. Naturally by the end of the movie Elliot has learned his lesson, and somewhere along the way he magically sheds his geeky persona and becomes a really cool guy. Oh dear lord.If there's a plus point to this movie, it's the array of fetish clothing that Hurley manages to appear in, running the gamut from schoolgirl uniform to red leather catsuit (the French Maid outfit is in the deleted scenes).

The trouble is each wish fulfilled somehow backfires so that the poor schmuck has to keep paging the Devil's ""666"" hot line to redo his wish.  On his wish fulfillment list (which is carefully worked around ""getting the girl""): Richest, Sexiest, Most Famous, Most Intelligent, Most Sensitive, and Most Charismatic.  The fun of it all is seeing HOW Fraser's wishes are going to get screwed up.The charming Fraser gets great mileage out of his meek geek,  getting a great chance to show off his comedic versatility with a variety of attitudes and accents as he morphs into each of his supposedly ideal characters . Gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley, who reminds me so much of a young Jacqueline Bisset in this movie, has a great time playing the sly, playful Deviless in disguise, whipping into smashing new outfits at the drop of a camera angle.Hand it to the producers and writers of this Faustian fluff in keeping the pace quick, the situations inventive, and not resorting to crass, predictable toilet humor to tarnish the comic luster.

Gone are the intelligence, wit, pathos, questioning of religion and disrespect for the divine ego that made the 1967 original so special, and all we have left is a set of thin gags stretched to the point of pain. Hurley and Fraser try gamely, but they don't have much to work with except a lot of costume changes. To top it off, the satisfying resolution of the original - Stanley Moon's maturing past the need for *any* sort of supernatural help-- is replaced here by a jaw-droppingly cheesy bit of divine intervention, a flurry of special effects, and a cute ending. Did they really think this denouement was covered by having Mme. Satan tell Elliott that heaven and hell are right here on earth after all, and gee whiz, life is what you make it? Gad.If they'd just called this movie something else it would just be another cute romantic comedy with a fantasy subplot and I'd have no problem with it.

This idea is that the devil, lucifer, beelzebub, whomever, is a sort of salesman (or woman) walking the Earth trying to close as many deals as possible. Everyone hates salespeople except salespeople. People like Elliott (played by the versatile Brendan Frasier) are the reason telemarketers exist: for every 10 wise people, there's always one sucker. Still, for the seller, the low percentage of success must be disheartening. I chuckled upon hearing the devil, played by Elizabeth Hurley, say ""this job sucks!""Unfortunately, so does the movie.This is the weakest work I've ever seen from Harold Ramis (at least as a director). Both uninteresting and unoriginal, `Bedazzled' fails at nearly everything it sets out to do: It should make you think about what you would do with seven wishes. It doesn't. It should make you laugh.

By now everyone knows the basic premise: a devil appears to a dweeby young man in the form of a beautiful woman and grants him seven wishes.This is Elizabeth Hurley's best performance ever, with her delightfully clipped British accent and stunning physical beauty coaxed along to perfection by director Harold Ramis. As another reviewer has stated, she deftly leads Elliot along like a puppy on a leash.The writing is also great in that it builds on the viewer's expectations. For a guy struggling along in a service sector job and pining after a cute girl who works for the same company, well duh...of course he's going to wish that he's rich and powerful and married to her. And the devil gives him exactly what he wished for, with hilarious results! When that wish blows up in his face (quite literally), of course he's going to re-work the wish so that Allison loves him and that he is a soulful, sensitive type. The devil grants his wish, with even more hilarious results.And so it goes for the rest of acts one and two.Congratulations to the makeup and special effects team because they transform Elliot into a Columbian drug lord, a freckle faced flower child and a seven and a half foot tall basketball star, among other things. The lead actress playing Allison also shows a variety of different looks and personalities in her embodiment in the wishes.While much of the action and situations is over-the-top, the movie cannot be considered a farce because it is all deftly resolved in act 3.

Perhaps she's Mrs. Satan and wants to work outside the home while Peter is off damning others to Hell?

Elizabeth Hurley almost cloned her character from Austin Powers into this movie. I'm sure it wasn't hard for her to be seductive and the range of her character doesn't extend too far. She is mostly charming however and is arguably the best character in the movie. Maybe the worst portrayal in the movie was Allison played by Francis O'Connor. She was not believable in the slightest and it would take a genius to understand why Fraser's character is madly in love with her.

97,timefreezer7,Entertaining comedy (and a decent remake),8,15 July 2003,"First of all I am a great fan of the original British version . This Hollywood modern remake is an enjoyable comedy with quite a few laughs . Without any reasonable doubt `Bedazzled' (2000) is inferior than the Dudley Moore film but this doesn't mean it should be left unnoticed. I am sure that most of the fans of the original will hate it and here's the reasons why . A) The remake has an entirely straightforward plot which focuses exclusively on the wishes the leading character makes . The 60's version included some great philosophical and existential insights , like when Moore moodily wondered `Why can't we choose our parents?' . It also contained some great satirical touches concerning the perennial battle between God and the Devil (like when Peter Cook recited the reasons which made him turn against God and ending up a fallen angel) . All these elements are absent here and the film suffers , but fortunately not severely . B) An abrupt ending . As aforementioned the plot rotates only around the wishes and as soon as the wishes end , so does the story . The 60's film had more story going on for it . There were specific reasons concerning the importance of Moore's soul for the Devil and why he was so special . We even got to see Heaven and hear God's voice !! The film lacks these things and just stops . Well I guess for the uninitiated the film will be more fun . As for me , I enjoyed the 2000 version despite these flaws . It is a professionally made comedy by the talented Harold Ramis and I believe it is slightly better than `Groundhog Day' (1993) where the script ran out of steam after the second half and the film just dragged on . Bedazzled (2000) is not boring for a single second and can be enjoyed immensely.
PLOT SYNOPSIS : The film opens with some scenes reminiscent of `The Mask' with Jim Carrey . Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) is a lonely guy who works in a big company . His colleagues deliberately ignore him or even avoid him in their social gatherings . Elliot is cute with a robust body and quite educated ,  but he belongs in the sad category of social misfits . As much as he tries , he can't make new friends . Every night he ends up in his small apartment , microwaves a `fast' dinner and watches TV until he falls to sleep . He is secretly in love with Alison (Frances O' Connor) a beautiful girl who works in the same company with him , but hardly knows he exists . After subsequent rejections Elliot is disappointed very much . Shortly thereafter he meets an ultra-gorgeous fascinating woman with a mysterious British accent who claims to be the Devil HERSELF (played by none other by Elizabeth Hurley) . The Devil offers Elliot a pact to make his life happier . She offers him a huge pile of paperwork , calling it a `contract' (which of course no one is going to bother to read) . The Devil tempts and eventually convinces Elliot to sign and sell his soul . The grant is 7 wishes where Elliot can literally have anything he wants . Of course as it always happens in movies with genies , things don't go exactly as planned . It is universally known that a deal with the Devil never pays off . Elliot 's wishes always turn sour and he has no other option but to return to the mundane reality . The Devil only wants his soul and always finds tricks to make the wishes go awry .This is the story of the film and despite the weakness of the script , the movie has two things going on for it . Firstly the performance of Brendan Fraser shows his great acting skills and his enormous comical talents . Fraser pulls off one successful metamorphosis after another , to the point he is barely recognizable ! Aside that , Fraser succeeds in the dramatic aspects of the character . Despite his height and broad shoulders which make him appear like a goon , he achieves being a likeable `everyday' guy with nice behavior whom you root for (something he succeeded in `School Ties' as well) . Elizabeth Hurley is also great in her role . She is a drop-dead charming , irresistibly beautiful woman . She is HOT ! (he he he). Hurley is convincing as a modern siren , the incarnation of a dangerous temptation whom you should never trust . Simultaneously she is likeable enough herself : she really can't harm you if you have strong will . The second asset of the film are the wishes . Most of them are well executed and offer some great laughs . The make-up is PERFECT and Fraser changes persona with great agility . Not since the `Nutty Professor' with Eddie Murphy have I seen so exceptional work in the styling department . My favorite wish was the first one , where Elliot becomes a Latin millionaire . Of course the wishes wouldn't be complete without the great talent of Fraser who unambiguously is a gifted actor and changes voices and looks utterly convincingly , like when he speaks Spanish . Now there is the little worm of doubt which bugs me and tells me that the dialogue could have been voiced-over , but even in this case I will have to give my deepest congratulations to the director and the editors for some perfect work of dubbing .
It is a great flaw that after the wishes the film ends up with a patchy cop-out and with a clichéd way . I was expecting more plot or at least more characterization on Elliot . I also found pointless the cameo of God (or was it an angel?) in the middle of the film and it should be explored more . Well , I guess we shouldn't be expecting much . `Bedazzled' (2000) is not innovative and will not be a classic . It is however an entertaining film and I recommend it for a boring evening with the video . If you want a good comedy with a decent script , some great laughs , good performances , some remarkable SFX and a few satirical hints (the homework that the Devil gives to the students is the proof of `Fermat 's Last Theorem' , a very difficult mathematical problem which puzzled people for centuries and there are legends about mathematicians in the Middle Ages wanting to sell their souls to the Devil to solve it) then do not hesitate and see it . Although far from groundbreaking (this honor should go to the 60's film) `Bedazzled' (2000) is one of the best comedies from the 90 's.BEDAZZLED (2000)                       8 / 10",Bedazzled
98,daved-3,see the original!!!,4,28 December 2000,"Bedazzled is a maddeningly flat attempt to remake a classic.  It isn't horrid, but I suppose people as talented as Harold Ramis and Brendon Fraser would really have to try to produce a really bad film.  The problem seems to be pacing--this version seems content to hit a so-so joke every couple of minutes, while the original was much more consistently funny.  This version is hardly trying--in the original, the magic words were ""Julie Andrews!"", here they're ""I wish"".  Does ""I wish"" seem funny to you? The big difference is of course casting Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil.  As an actress, Ms. Hurley has very nice breasts.  That's probably unfair, she's not bad and does bring a sense of panache to the role, but she raises a problem--why would the main character still be interested in his co-worker after getting a gander at Ms. Hurley's cleavage?  Fraser is sensational, and probably deserves an Oscar nod if people in comedies ever got Oscar nominations.  Fraser is just about the only actor who can go from drama (With Honors) to action (The Mummy) to comedy (George of the Jungle) and be credible in each.  He handles his various roles impeccably.  But the screenplay is flat and listless, and seemingly goes from set-up to set-up with no motivation.  The ending is straight out of the blue, although it does make a certain amount of sense.  Still, Bedazzled is a far cry from the original.",Bedazzled
99,spenrh,"Some stupid, but a few funny parts",6,27 February 2020,"The idea of being granted wishes in exchange for your soul is not a new idea. The idea was almost copied from the 1960s version of ""Bedazzled"". This idea was also used in several ""Twilight zone"" episodes, one being the TZ ep where the character Walter Bediker starts off as a hypochondriac with health concerns, then the devil appears in his bedroom and offers him the wish of permanent perfect health, invincibility, and eternal life, in exchange for his soul. Walter: ""My soul!!?"" Devil: ""You won't even know it's gone"". A near parallel exchange is said here in ""Bedazzled"" between Brendan Frazier's Elliott and Elizabeth Hurley's devil.Elliott is an annoying overlydesperate character who has no clue that his co-workers despise him, and he keeps pestering them desperately clinging on to them like a leech. And the way he continues to desperately leech onto them at the club made me cringe. I could feel how those people were feeling so overwhelmed and annoyed by him. And the way he hopelessly longed for Allison was also overly desperate.The movie got interesting with Elizabeth Hurley's introduction to the movie, but it sure didn't escape stupidity when getting into the 7 wishes and the whole devil/wishes/her wanting his soul parts. Alot of the lines exchanged have definitely been heard before in similar themed movies, as well as the types of wishes Elliott asked for from her. When is the first wish not to be very rich in these types of plots? And every wish then being ruined in some way by the devil? In another Twilight zone episode with the genie in the bottle, the elderly store owner couple wishes for a load of money, and that wish is ruined due to them finding out that the taxes they have to pay leaves them with almost no money again.Elliott as the Colombian drug Lord was a semi new idea, even though him wishing to be rich wasn't. The special effects team did a pretty good job of altering Elliot's appearances according to each wish of his. As the Hispanic drug lord, they made him look taller, more tanned and with a longer different shaped nose. The twist was that even though he wished to be married to Allison, the devil made her absolutely hate him so much that she was yelling at him to get out of his life and throwing things at him (it was sort of funny the way she simultaneously threw like 10
small light bulbs at him and seeing them all hit the door as he quickly closed it on them). Raul, the guy that she actually wanted, then decided to take the drug business from Elliot and have himself and his new crew try to kill him. So, this was the first sign that the devil wanted to ruin Elliott's wishes so horribly that she'd be able to claim his soul as quickly as possible (which really wasn't difficult to find out).Elliot's second wish was pretty funny actually, him wishing to be a very sensitive guy and then being so sensitive that he cried just from looking at the sunset (the way he cried the last time looking at it before leaving that wish was the funniest). Allison found him to be so freakishly sensitive that she jumped at the bully kicking sand at him and thanked him so dearly for taking her away from Elliot. And she expressed her enourmous relief to now be with a guy who would ignore him just to get in his pants, rather than to continue sitting there listening to Elliot's nonstop ultra sensitive poetry and sugary praising. And the way Elliot looked here, as this little whiny red haired kid looking about 10 years younger than the normal Elliott. That whole wish was comicalThe basketball wish was very stupid. The movie crossed over to being so ridiculous, even for a movie like this, when making him unrealistically tall, showing him jump literally 40 feet into the air to slam dunk a basket, and ridiculous levels of disgusting excessive sweating literally pouring from his hair (it was a little bit funny though the way he screamed when not being able to push 666 on his pager to change wishes). Then there was his wish to be intelligent, charming, and articulate, and of course, gay. The last part of that wish made me cringe again, not so much because he realized he was gay, but because of the stupid stereotypical gay partner and the way it played out. Then was Elliot's wish to be a powerful leader, and you'll never guess, Lincoln on the night of his assassination? Nooooo. That wish did parallel the same above mentioned genie Twilight zone episode where the store owner wished to be a powerful leader, and was then Hitler on the night of his death.The part of Elliott walking into the church beared similarity to the 1980s film ""Oh God, you devil"" where he asked to actually speak to ""the person God"" and then got branded as crazy.The same actors/actresses who were Elliot's dismissive co workers in his real world appeared as side characters in many of his wishes, which showed how this movie did have a cast which could convincingly play different types of characters (although not all of them in every wish were that enjoyable of a character). And, I liked the way Elliott finally stood up to one of his scorning co workers when back in his real world later in the movie. And some of the movie's special effects were good. But there were just too many stupid things that kept it from being a really good movie.SPOILERThe ending of the movie wasn't too bad. Allison still wasn't interested in Elliott, but he then met his real girl of interest, a new nextdoor neighbor who looked like Allison but personality-wise she was an almost complete female version of himself.",Bedazzled

101,blade-21,One Hell of a Movie,7,11 November 2000,"This has to be one of the better remakes of previous ""classics"". Elizabeth Hurley and Brendan Frazer seem to have brought a different perspective to the story although Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore were superb in the original.It seems that much of humanity finds the faustian theme to be fascinating regardless as to whether it is depicted gothically or humorously. This film plays with that fascination and implies the clichéd admonition to ""be careful what you wish for because you might just get it"".Hurley competently plays an alluring Devil and Brendan Frazer, at the outset, makes an excellent simple character - a type he played so well in Blast from the Past. His talents are however, given great scope with a string of characters that make up his various incarnations.The film ends in a fairly mushy way which may be a turn off for some people but overall I think that this is a mildly enjoyable way to spend some cinema time.",Bedazzled

This is a rather underrated comedy, great fun throughout and very often laugh-out-loud funny. Yes, the Peter Cook-Dudley Moore original is probably better, but this remake, by Harold Ramis, the genius behind 'Groundhog Day' and a string of other great comedies, has a lot going for it. I can't remember when I've laughed as much at a comparable mainstream Hollywood feelgood film. Fraser has a prodigious comic talent and basic likeableness and Frances O'Connor is good as the object of his unrequited love. Liz Hurley is gorgeous throughout, and contrary to received wisdom she can act and is perfect in the role. Bonus, there's a hilarious turn by the godlike Toby Huss (Jupiter from 'Nikki').",Bedazzled

So finally came the day I saw it and I must say that even after all these years it's quite enjoyable.I want to talk about a few aspects of the movie very brieflyThe story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, and you can't really predict what will happen next. It's a story about a regular guy whose life changes quite drastically after meeting the devil and accidentally becoming everything he never thought he could. Everything comes true but usually with a twist or two.
Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched the movie everything with music felt just right, just like you would expect.)
And that's it. This wasn't made to be the greatest movie ever and it's okay. It fulfilled its purpose of entertainment and I love it.Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and a few won't. Personally, after watching it this feels like not the greatest movie and not the worst one so it's somewhere in the middle around 7 out of 10.

I give it an 8 and the original a 10.  It was entertaining; and a pretty good update of the original for modern times.  These are really timeless themes anyway; but if this movie got people to check out the original or even other stuff by Cook & Dudley then more power to Ramis, Hurley, and Fraser.  I thought Fraser did a pretty good job and Hurley was excellent.  I hope she continues to get other comedy roles that let her do more stuff than just look hot and be a sidekick for Austin Powers.",Bedazzled
105,jeffpk,Surprisingly good update,8,19 March 2009,"I am a big fan of the original Dudley Moore/Peter Cooke film so I was surprised to find I really liked this version.Many times when a classic is ""updated"" all they do is change the setting and pretexts, but the update here is far deeper. Though amusing and rather irreverent for its time. the Moore/Cooke movie in the end sticks pretty close to the classic theology. God is distant, unknowable and terrible to anger. Satan is prideful and uncaring about anyone but himself.This film however updates the theology and with it makes it more applicable to the modern day. God is not distant, just hands off because we have to make our own decisions... but he does give us a whisper when we're ready to hear it. The devil is not really his adversary, but a sly sort of partner in the whole matter of educating humanity. And both are reflections of what is already inside of us, good and bad, and vice versa. In the ""man makes his heaven or hell"" moral it falls right in line with modern theology. In fact, an interesting seminary paper could be written contrasting these two movies and how the differences speak to the ongoing revelation of god in our lives.In short, whoever posted that the theology in this movie was not defensible is way out of touch with modern theology.",Bedazzled

In fact, I thought I'd probably end up turning it off after a half hour, as it looked in the trailer like it would be one of those silly, go for the gag-laughs Hollywood pieces of junk. What a surprise! This was an excellent, entertaining film that I thoroughly enjoyed. It's basically a love story, but far from a ""chick flick""(yeah, I'm a guy), it's a clever one that is well written, has a number of different subplots that are interesting to see played out, and deftly mixes comic overtones with a touching character study. I wasn't a particular fan of Brendan Fraser till now, but I was blown away by the way he perfectly captured the number of different personalities portrayed in the movie. Even the technical aspects of the movie are impressive: in one scenario the special effects wizards make Fraser into a 7'6'' pro basketball player that is totally convincing.",Bedazzled
107,nunyerbiz,Decent... but could have been much better,7,27 October 2000,"Bedazzled has a basic ""Be careful what you wish for"" premise. Brendan Fraser plays Elliot. He is a relatively annoying cubicle dweller who has few friends and no love life. One night at a bar he meets up with who else but Satan herself! Yadda Yadda, etc etc, and he signs away his soul for seven wishes. As you may expect, his wishes turn out to have some fatal flaw that is exploited by the devil and comic hi-jinks ensue.While this movie isn't going to blow anyone away, it was definately above average. Brendan Fraser did an admirable job playing multiple 'characters' during the wish sequences. Although his base character introduced at the beginning of the film may have been a bit over the top. I think it's his best performance since ""School Ties"". Elizabeth Hurley provides little more than eye candy as the devil. The supporting cast of Elliot's friends is also quite good as they too travel with him throughout the wish sequences.I only had two major complaints about the plot. First, Elliot never learns from his mistakes. He continues time and again to make very open-ended and generic wishes. By the third or fourth wish you can pretty much predict the outcome. Second, the love interest, played by Frances O'Conner isn't really defined enough early on. It seems the only reason she is the love interest is because she's a hot blond who happens to work at the same company as Elliot.If you take the movie for what it is, you'll enjoy yourself. However, I feel Bedazzled could have been so much better had Elliot not been so dumb. A battle of wits between Elliot (making wishes) and the devil (sabotaging the wishes) would have given the film a great added angle.",Bedazzled

As certain as Vivien Leigh was meant to play Scarlett O'Hara, no one could have done a better job playing The Devil...in this case a sly, brilliantly cunning, sexy devil who playfully torments Brendan by dooming each of his wishes with unintended, nasty surprises. She effortlessly leads him along like a puppy dog on a leash.Besides her comedic wit, (and some clever writing) I would be remiss not to mention that Elizabeth Hurley looks perfect, absolutely perfect, in every scene. Her clipped, refined British accent is the aural equivalent of a film shot on Kodachrome.Bedazzled exudes a positive, good-natured warmth, and is proof that comedy doesn't have to depend on silly sophomoric antics, pratfalls, or foul language.ADDENDUM January 10, 2008.

It is not one of Harold Ramis' best, but it definitely has his traits and in it own right, is a family classic. Fraser plays the unwitting fool perfectly; flirting between the lines of cringe and comedy. Elizabeth Hurley steals the show, playing the perfectly wicked devil. With class, sass, and punch, Hurley outshines every scene and makes Bedazzled memorable. The film ends on a cliché note, being cute, warm, and fuzzy.

The actual method of voiding the agreement (which I won't spoil) is suitable (and probably has literary precedent); unfortunately, the way in which this is demonstrated in the film is just boring  both visually and dramatically.Fraser is almost unrecognizable in many of his guises.

Brendan Fraser stars as Eliot Richards, a man whom nobody seems to like or want to know about. One day, in a bar, he declares his love for Alison (Frances O'Connor). Along comes the Devil('Mrs. Wooden' Liz Hurley) who grants him 7 wishes, and maybe a crack at finding his true love. However, they don't go swimmingly.

There's heaps more that could have been done with it.  Brendan Fraser never really got the chance to flex his comedic muscle as much as I would have liked, Frances O'Connor, in her first ""Hollywood blockbuster"" had little more than a passing role and was under-utilised.  The big surprise, for me, came in the shape of vampy vixen and she-Devil, Elizabeth Hurley.  Again she could have really camped it up (there was an element of restraint), but it appeared that she was really relishing her role as the Devil anyway.  I guess that really letting loose on this film would have meant that the PG rating wouldn't have applied therefore it would be open to a wider audience.

This film suffers from an awkward pace, very questionable and cheap effects, and a weak script.

The Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original had a cynical bite that is completely missing here.  It was also concerned not just with the schlemiel's wishes, but with what makes the Devil tick.  Why does he do what he does?  What's his relationship with God?  Unfortunately, that movie's viewpoint that God is generally far more callous and satanic than Satan is not even hinted at here.That being said, this version does what it wants to do very well.  Elizabeth Hurley is hot and Brendan Fraser again proves to be a likable and versatile actor.  He also convinced me: you can believe Dudley Moore as an unnoticed little shnook.  But Brendan Fraser???  Well, he does it.This is a good (safe) American version of an acerbic British classic.  It is well worth seeing (at matineé prices.)

118,PeterKurten911,too bad it had to have an ending,8,24 July 2004,"I find myself often intrigued by some vague piece of information about a movie's plot or ten seconds of footage & after the first viewing, my interest has been proven to be right once again : i thought i'd dig it, and i dug it. So was the case with Bedazzled, reading a rather spoiling review in a magazine when it was running its first week in theaters. (Allthough it wasn't until its DVD release that i sat down & giggled )The 7-wishes-in-exchange-for-the-soul plot immediately offers more possibilities to build a comedy on than, for instance, the classic triple feature used in every Aladdin movie. First of all, the number is greater and second, its not as much about wishes than it is about interpreting them & filling up the holes with satanic twists. The whole premise takes but a small quarter to develop, followed by the series of acts, strung together by the enthusiastic yet stylish performance of lovely Liz Hurley, in which we get some minor storyline development. That is where i locate my sole grief : i didn't really want to see Brendan Fraser get smart & apply the contract rules towards a truly 'happy' ending. Hurley was likable enough to let her win. But what are you going to do about it ? America requires it.For those who demand a critical note of weak points, i took a step back and noted some. One, Brendan Fraser is by no means necessary to this movie, even if he does a decent job playing the nerd. It just requires someone capable of playing the nerd. For instance Tom Hanks could have done it back in his Dragnet days. Two, not all portrayals of Frasers wishes are that good, the 'emotional man' being the most tedious yet luckily also the shortest of them all, possibly cause that two-word formula wasn't much to work with in the first place. Then again, it is nicely fitted between the strong Columbia opening & the basketball fantasy ( pay attention to that appealing instrumental piece we all know from the Full Monty's dress rehearsal, 'na-na-na-nah HEY na-na-na-nah' ). Three, that stupid hamburger-&-a-large-coke joke was far too predictable not to look stupid in the whole of the comedy.All in all, what have we got ? good story, good interpretation, rocking female lead and all that put together cleverly enough to cover the major weaknesses. Highly enjoyable, though owning the DVD would not be among my wishes - i would require several hundreds like that.",Bedazzled

The two dogs named Dudley & Peter was a nice little nod to the innovative original too.Hurley was surprisingly good in her role and having a Brit starring in it was a the right thing to do. Frazer is a very good versatile actor, always good at comedy. It's more OTT than the original and it didn't last the distance quite as well, notably sagging in the last third, I thought. The script is funny but not subtle and witty like the 67 film. That script had a lot of Peter Cook gems in and is worth watching just to see a different type of humour.The remake didn't murder it at all, like some have wrongly said. It was a quite different version of it for more in your face modern tastes. Stands up on its own well if you didn't see or want to see the original, making it a worthy remake project.

130,markbeardslee,Brendan Fraser is a god and a monster,5,23 June 2006,"Brendan Fraser never ceases to amaze me with the work he is capable of doing. How many languages does he speak? First he does the goofy stuff, straight out of Jerry Lewis, and then he plays the straight sideman like Dean Martin, and finally becomes the superhero in ""The Mummy."" No demands on his acting performance, whether as the confused but morally centered King George in ""George of the Jungle"" or the confused but morally centered Adam from ""Blast from the Past"" to his Oscar-worthy performance as the confused but morally centered Clayton in ""Gods and Monsters,"" seem to out-demand his capabilities.Fraser is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood today.Confused but morally centered may have been his shtick in several of his most popular films, but he is not typecast. Witness ""The Mummy"" movies, or his amazing work in ""The Quiet American"" and ""Crash."" This is a studious actor, who engages deeply in his homework and strives never to leave a scene flat. I would guess he would be the kind of actor a director would love, for his knowledge, his dedication and his willingness to push boundaries.All that said, this particular movie is rather lame and it is really only Fraser's genius that saves it. Proving capable of playing a cavalcade of characters, from a rich Latino heartthrob to a convincing geek and everything in between, Fraser saves this movie from the trash heap. Sure, Elizabeth Hurley provides eye candy and she delivers her cleverly written lines with ease, and she's even a little bit funny from time to time. But it is Fraser who remains funny, or troubled, or terrified, or bold, or whatever the situation demands he be, with a surprising sense of alacrity.Sure, this review is mostly about Fraser, but that's just the point. As with most every other film starring this chameleonic actor, Fraser somehow manages to come to the fore. He even gave the amazing Michael Caine a run for his money in his understated role as ""The Quiet American.""

131,monkeybone,"He's in love with a beautiful woman, but hasn't got a chance in Hell.",8,1 August 2002,"As the saying goes 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Many might argue the same could be said about Harold Ramis' modern remake of the 1967 classic starring Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Now with the multi-talented Brendan Fraser in the lead role as Elliot Richards, the socially inept nerd who doesn't fit in no matter how hard he tries and the one-dimensional Elizabeth Hurley as the sultry Prince of Darkness (""Well the Prin-cess of Darkness anyway""), Bedazzled is a good comedy despite its' flaws. In a nutshell, the premise is the same as that of the original but brought up to date with the modern movie-goer in mind. Elliot Richards is a computer technician who is secretly in love with beautiful co-worker Alison Gardener (Frances O'Connor). One night, he finally gets the chance to ask her out but blows it when she doesn't recognise him, much to the amusement of his fellow workers. Asking God for help, his prayers are inadvertently answered by The Devil who promises to help get the girl of his dreams in the form of seven wishes. Unfortunatley for Elliot, there's a catch. In return for aforementioned wishes, he has to give up his soul. It would ruin the film however to say what these wishes are as that would spoil the outcome of the movie. There are so many things that can be said about Bedazzled. With Ramis at the helm, it could be a far more superior film, but sadly, Groundhog Day it ain't. Like Brendan Fraser, Ramis is extremely talented but both are let down by a script that runs out of steam very quickly.The wishes that Elliot comes up with are met with humourous intervention by The Devil but aren't as jaw-achingly funny as they could be. Fraser's performances throughout the film are superb showing off his versatility as an actor alongside the ever beautiful and also extremely talented actress Frances O'Connor. Liz Hurley on the other hand is just there to look great giving only a tame version of Lucifer instead of being the ultimate incarnation of evil as he is so often portrayed. Overall, Bedazzled certainly has its' moments that will cheer you up and make you feel good. It may not be the greatest film ever made, but there are much bigger turkeys out there.",Bedazzled

Whilst not the best script, Brendan makes it watchable and even enjoyable. He plays about a dozen different characters, and each one different. I swear I cannot hear sports players or commentators now without hearing Brendan's voice over the picture saying... ""we wanna play good, and we gotta play good... and i think we played pretty good. But you know, there's no I in team and we had to go out there and play good, and I think we played real good tonight."" While he is sweating so much they must have had a hosepipe on his head and back. But, I really actually enjoyed Brendan, I think he saved what would have been an utterly dreadful movie.",Bedazzled

134,The_Vigilante,A Nice little remake,7,15 November 2001,"I was a bit reluctant at first to actually sit down and watch this film, the major off point being it stars Liz Hurly. As I have said in other reviews I do NOT like this woman, however she is the perfect choice for this film (I somehow cannot see someone like Liv Tyler or Gwyneth Paltrow playing the role in the same manner).This movie is actually quite good, ok it's not great or is it an Oscar winner, but it is enjoyable.Brendon Fraser plays the lead role of Elliot, a sad pathetic individual who is besotted by a woman at work called Alison. While out one night Elliot states that he would give anything to get her; enter the Devil (Liz Hurly).In exchange for his soul Elliot is given 7 wishes, to use as he deems fit, of course everything doesn't go according to what he hopes.Written by Peter Cook, the man who wrote the original 1976 Bedazzled, it is everything you could want in a family film. It's directed by Harold Ramis (Egon from Ghostbusters), so what else would you expect except good old fashioned fun.                       Marks out of 10, it gets a 7.",Bedazzled

Brendan Fraser is funny as always, with so many transformations he does so well, but Elizabeth Hurley steals the show. She never looked better, and never put on such a convincing performance.

I seriously considered turning it off halfway through (just as an aside, the only film I've ever actually stopped watching is Tank Girl). What seriously bothered me about this movie was that the devil was a nice, likeable person. Elizabeth Hurley, admittedly gorgeous, simply is too nice and playful. I liked her a great deal more than the guy I was supposed to like and feel sorry for, Elliot, and I doubt that's what was intended. The wishes were very predictable and some of them (Sensitive Elliot) were so annoying that I had to fast forward a bit to get through them. Avoid this one at all costs.",Bedazzled

The movie drags during the beginning introductions and the fantasy wish sequences are uneven, with some of them suffering from bad pacing and dialogue.  Even so this movie is an enjoyable little tale, with a cute little moral lesson.  There are moments of hilarity and Elizabeth Hurley flourishes in the role as the sexy unholy temptress who seems to just love her job (although she could have also done so much more with her role as well).  Fraser is decent in his role but it certainly isn't one of his best non-dramatic performances (for a similar but much better example of Fraser's talent, look at the delightful ""Blast From The Past"").

All that's left here is the boy wants girl window dressing, and some very smarmy messages about trust in God (totally perverting the original, btw).  No thank you.

He meets the Devil, or rather she introduces herself, and she gives him seven wishes, but he mucks them up. Seems a little like a rip-off of Gail Carson Levine's ""The Wish"" if you've ever read it.Brendan Fraser is all right, and the same goes for Frances O'Connor.

There were many times when I laughed out loud.And Elizabeth Hurley is a GREAT unconventional Devil.  It is really refreshing to see something other than the mustached, horned, caped figure that seems to have permeated our cultural mythology.  Ms. Hurley plays the Devil as seductive and inviting and yet devious and untrustworthy.

That's why he made the movie, he was probably tired of trying to write books.I just must say, I've seem all kinds of movies, my favourite movie use to be Forrest Gump and I didn't even know why. I still have just one thing I haven't figured out about Forrest Gump, a movie made for people who lived everything in their lives already. I still wonder how the soundtrack composer could do that music be so perfect. It tells all the movie story in just one song with no words at all. That's just another genius work.But, Bedazzled have that, and even more. I don't even know how many movies I've ever watched. I did missed some big names such as Schindler's List or half of Hanibal trilogy or even Dogville. But I've watched most of the big ones and a lot of small ones as well.I do watch animes, Full Metal is a work greater than Matrix. Azumanga Daioh reminds me of Seinfeld a damn lot. Ranma is the best anime comedy I've seem and Akira is almost childish, like Forrest Gump, but it's so nice.12 Monkeys, Brazil, Monty Python and all Terry Gilliam work is way too pessimist. I love all of them, but being pessimist make them incomplete to me, as I'm an optimist.I also have watched some European movies and most Brazilian movies.

154,FightingIrish,One of the most heart-warming comedies in years...,9,27 September 2001,"Bedazzled is a lovely remake of the 1967 film (unseen by me), and it shows the true emotion of  love in an offbeat sort of way. The movie stars one of my favorite actors, Brendan Fraser, as a complete loser and social outcast, who desperately yearns for the love of someone else. Brendan Fraser's nerd impression is actually quite amusing, albeit sad. We watch the people at his workplace constantly avoid him, when he thinks that they regard him as a friend. We also see his love for a woman (Frances O'Connor), and how he makes funny but pathetic attempts to introduce himself to her.  Elliot (Fraser's character in the movie) later meets another woman (Elizabeth Hurley), who has an incredible offer for him to agree to: She will put seven wishes in his possession if he sells her his soul. His soul, you say. Why would he give his only soul to this person? Because she's the Devil.
Now Elliot has some trouble with the mere fact that he must sell his soul to this person, just for seven measly wishes. Seven wishes, and no more. Just seven wishes that could alter his life forever, making him wiser, and probably a better person. So the Devil hands him the contract and he signs away, giving the only thing that makes us significant to the, as Hurley says, ""Princess of Darkness"". Throughout the remainder of the movie he will learn a lot. I'm not going to spoil any of his wishes, but he will find out more than he needs to know about people and life, which makes this a great movie.There was only one problem I had with this film, that is if Harold Ramis could have picked anyone for the Devil, why Elizabeth Hurley? He could of picked someone like Sandra Bernhard or Courtney Love, a real (something or other) in laments terms, and instead they get a sex symbol? But Ms. Hurley's performance, however, is a lot more keen than I expected, and she adds an entirely new edge to The Devil, making it a great film.Now I'm not going to give away the ending, either, but I must say it's one of the better endings that I've seen in recent years. It's good, it  makes sense, and it is very sweet and cheery. With all the depressing and vulgar crap in our film industry today, this ending is quite sure to please just about anyone (unless you enjoy morbid and depressing resolutions) , making Bedazzled a really great film.

157,mdholt,Wonder Bread Sandwich,7,20 October 2000,"This movie was like making a good sandwich with Wonder Bread.  The beginning is slow, and I didn't like the end, but the middle was funny as hell.It takes a long time for this movie to really get started.  Elliot Richardson is such a loser at the beginning that it is painful to watch. He isn't even one of those lovable losers like Rob Schneider's copy man.  He is a painfully annoying loser.  His office mates are probably the biggest jerks that anyone has ever had the misfortune of working with.Just about the time I was getting really uncomfortable watching such annoying characters the movie finally starts.  Once Elliot meets the devil the movie gets pretty good.  Parts are a lot like `George of The Jungle.' There are a lot of really corny lines, and site gags.  Brendan Fraser does those type of lines really well, and I really enjoyed them.Elizabeth Hurley has been panned for her performance, but I thought she did quite well.  She seemed a perfect fit for the devil, and I could really picture her as a devilish vixen toying with Elliot's mind.  A lot like Lucy holding the ball for Charlie Brown, the devil gets Elliot's trust only to pull everything out from under him.  The idea of the devil being a vixen works better than an old man, but Peter Cook is a better actor than Elizabeth Hurley.  Anyway, just being Elizabeth Hurley is worth a few bucks right there.The movie built well on itself.  Each wish was a little faster paced and funnier than the last.  Right as his wishes were coming to an end I was thinking he was close to a classic.Then the end came.  The last half hour of this thing turns from a corny comedy (a very good one at that) to a sappy fable (and not the greatest either).  It wasn't awful, it just was a bit cookie cutter and corporate. Everything was put into its nice little package, and everyone feels good at the end.All in all, not a bad way to spend two hours.",Bedazzled

The character is quite sad since I see too many real life people in him. Fast forward and Elliot gets a chance to fulfill his every dream trough seven wishes offered by the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) in exchange for his soul.
The movies is all about the wishes, the make up the comedy and laughs. It all ends happily of course (I don't regard this as a spoiler since it is a comedy without any claims for irony or dark twists) which is appropriate for the movie but not very unique. I must recommend the DVD version that contains deleted scenes since they cut out a whole wish episode that probably didn't fit in but it was quite fun and actually added to the movie even if it is watched after the main movie is finished.I would like to see the original movie that this one was based on, starring Dudley Moore whom I'm not very fond of but still this idea is a good one and it just might have something extra.Rated 5/10 for being fun and enjoyable to watch but nothing more.",Bedazzled

163,amck,A misbegotten complete failure. See the original instead.,1,11 November 2003,"Remaking the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original is a dangerous proposal at best and this one fails in so many ways. First, all the philosophical and wickedly delicious satire that grounds the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original are ruthlessly thrown out like yesterday's bathwater. There are no conversations, much less witty or intelligent conversations, about the nature of God, the Devil, and man. Either the writers were too dim to *get it*, didn't think the audience would put up with an intellectual dimension or most likely just couldn't top the original script.Second, I can't believe anyone would be stupid enough to cast a woman as the Devil, much less a beautiful one. The whole point of Fraser's character's bargain with the Devil was to win a girl he was too shy to approach. If you don't see the incongruity of conspiring with a woman who looks like Elizabeth Hurley to win some other woman, I can't explain it to you. Sure enough, even the writers of this dreck woke up one morning and realized, ""Hey, Elliot's quite likely to notice that the Devil is more attractive than any other option on his plate!"", necessitating a scene where Hurley changes into a HUGE DEVIL, complete with warts, yellow eyes, and the full range of big-budget Special Effects, to squelch THAT idea.Finally, as another reviewer has noted, Elliot's wishes are just scattershot semi-random stabs at getting himself into a situation he can live with. There's no successive refinement of the wishes to take into account what happened earlier, thus no true matching of wits (the traditional essence of Faust tales) between the Devil and Elliot.The sets are opulent and the costumes exquisite. Big production values all around.

167,coyote521,What were they thinking?,1,30 April 2001,"It's hard to believe that the director who made the terrific ""Groundhog Day"" and the clever, and sometimes very funny ""Analyze This"" , along with the wonderful actor from ""The Scout"" and ""Gods and Monsters"" could have made this mess. Not one joke (there really is only one joke here, misstated wishes) works, and nothing plays out. To make matters worse, there is the jaw-dropping performance by Ms. Hurley. Does she really think that bouncing up and down when she walks ( and even sometimes when she's supposed to be standing still) is funny or sexy?It's really not Brendan Fraser's fault, and it's not the first time that he's been seen over-playing in a desperate attempt to make unfunny material work (see ""dudley do-right"" for a textbook example of desperation), but what was going on with Mr. Ramis? Did he just give up on the project at some point?They should have burned this",Bedazzled
168,Joypunk-2,Somewhat disappointing yet slightly worth the money - Contains spoilers,8,28 October 2000,"After highly anticipating the release of this movie, I still waited a week before I went to actually see it in the theater. The previews made this movie out to be a slapstick humor with the sex-appeal of Elizabeth Hurley in her fascinating wardrobe.Unlike what others have said, I was fairly disappointed with the performances of both Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley. Although, I would blame that mostly on the roles that were scripted. No matter how good the actor is, they cannot do a good job playing a poorly written role. The character development was not thought out very well, the choices that Fraser makes are illogical (anyone would figure out that extremes don't work after two or three tries, not five), and Hurley plays too sweet of a devil. That's not all together a bad thing, the sweetness of her character adds to the seductive nature of Satan, but I don't feel like it fit. It almost seemed as though the film portrayed God and Satan as old chums, not enemies.If you don't want to spoil the ending, don't read on.I feel that the ending in this movie does allow for the fairy tale ""they all lived happily ever after"" feeling, but I'm still not happy with it. Having a clause in the contract that says truly benevolent wishes void the contract is a cop out. Well, perhaps not entirely, but how Hurley reacted to his wish was very disappointing. I'm sure Satan would have been furious that someone had escaped being damned into Hell. The ending gave you a feel that Hurley and Fraser would now be friends.Maybe it's just my religious beliefs that kept me from truly enjoying this movie. Despite all the disappointments, I would still rate this with 8/10. The guy in me tells me it deserves 10/10 just for the outfits Hurley wears, but the critic knocks it down to 8/10, mainly due to my disappointment in the script. Overall, spend your money on this one, you'll probably enjoy it.",Bedazzled
169,kingralf2003,Does what it is supposed to..,9,6 February 2019,I watched this film as I was a fan of Brendan Frazer and Liz Hurley. I hadn't seen the original which can often be a good thing. I loved this and laughed at all the right times. Liz Hurley looks delicious and does a very good job here but Brendan Frazer is excellent and I still laugh at him as the Columbian drug lord. The story marches on and keeps it from sticking anywhere. I thoroughly enjoyed it and like the title says. It made me laugh like a comedy should.,Bedazzled
170,maria-em1905,Nice comedy,10,3 August 2013,"I know I can't give you some insights about the movie that would mean a lot. Anyway, I think it made the best out of the story about the devil and even though it can't compare to Ma vie es un enfer, it was a nice comedy to watch. Elizabeth Hurley is a great comedian, really. I didn't expect something that good from a model. Along with Brandon, it was a nice dialogue to watch. I would also say each story had its unique insights that I found not too pretentious and just the kind that would make you think about some things in life, but not too seriously. I don't understand why that comedy wasn't unappreciated in its time. It served everything that a good funny movie ought to - nice laughs, fresh jokes, good acting and an interesting story. I enjoyed watching it and I recommend it to everyone, as long as they feel like watching a fine comedy.",Bedazzled
171,cheewrip,Almost fun,4,22 June 2001,"Elizabeth Hurley is hopelessly lost in her role, trying to spice the devilish flavour with ridiculously idiotic walk - I had no idea that Dark One hopped around like (not even a Playboy) bunny. Brendan Fraser, although somewhat intense with early geekish Elliot Richards, enjoys being there more as the film grows. Watchable from a rather aesthetic point of view - dramatic changes of scenery make it fast and sometimes even fun.",Bedazzled
172,Zman-23,A rare treat for comedy/action fans.,10,21 March 2001,"Very few directors have ever been able to maintain such a fine balance of humor, action & story as Harold Ramis has done with Bedazzled. I haven't had so much fun at the theater since Planes Traines & Automobiles. I enjoyed it so much, that the next day I rented the original ( its boring ) & then went to see it again the day after that !Aside from being chock full of lip ripping laffs, the story leads one to personal & philosophical insights without getting bogged down in overdone dialog . My compliments to all the actors also, who did outstanding work in bringing their characters to life .",Bedazzled
173,regenerating,Harold Ramis makes yet another great comedy,7,11 November 2000,"I didn't know what to think of ""Bedazzled"" when i saw the previews, but i trusted Harold Ramis's directing, so i went to see it.  It is a really great comedy.  I know some people would look at it and think ""oh great, another dumb Brendan Fraser movie"", but Brendan Fraser was cast perfectly for the lead role. As we know Brendan likes to take many different kinds of roles from movie to movie (School Ties, Airheads, Gods and Monsters, George of the Jungle, etc....)  Because his character in the film changes personalities every 15 minutes it is the perfect role for him. Elizabeth Hurley did get a little annoying after a while, but she didn't by any means ruin the movie.   i saw this movie alone and laughed out-loud many times, if you're looking for a good laugh, then see it.",Bedazzled
174,descolada99,Eye candy and good humor,9,20 October 2000,"I liked this movie alot. I went into it expecting just Elizabeth Hurley eye candy, but I was pleasantly surprised. I laughed alot in this movie, because they didn't dumb it down and make it full of fart/dick/scatological jokes (a.k.a. There's Something About Mary and the like).The drug lord sequence was great. The basketball sequence was hilarious. The commentary was so funny because it was just a little exaggerated, but not much.  The sequence where he wishes to be President is good too. I won't give that away.The end was nice. A story where he realizes he has to just be himself to be happy. I loved God in the movie, and God and the Devil playing chess at the end.Overall, a really good movie. Full of laughs.",Bedazzled
175,douglass3000,2nd rate remake of Peter Cook classic,5,21 August 2001,"If you have never seen the original 1967 film with Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, this movie would seem okay.  The premise is still amusing, but the execution here is lacking.  Ms. Hurley is nice to look at, but that's about all you can say for her.On the other hand, Raquel Welch was nice to look at in the original playing the part of Lust, PLUS Peter Cook with his sardonic smile and casual bits of deviltry was the perfect Satan, and Dudley Moore was great as the poor sap caught in his clutches.  It's still available at Blockbuster.  Please, please, please:  don't waste your time on the remake, which is inferior in every way; go rent the original!",Bedazzled

Probably isn't an 8 but it's an easy and fun watch, scores well for it is.",Bedazzled
177,vanladybug,How about fizzled...,6,1 March 2001,"Elizabeth Hurley is a goddess,yes and Brendan Fraser is somewhat amusing, but this movie is better to sit on the shelf than be on your screen. Bedazzled is a mix of an inconsistent plot, weak humor and very little character development. It's a good attempt to be named ""The Feel Good Movie of the Year"", but didn't quite do it. Perhaps next time Brendan Fraser should get some acting lessons prior to the shoot.",Bedazzled
178,wamba1,"Loopy humor, down-to-earth wisdom",10,7 June 2001,"Someone in Movie Heaven dropped a feather down on Ramis, the director of such good time romps as Ghostbusters and Stripes. His remake of this 1967 classic rides on the slumped shoulders of Elliot (Brendan Fraser at his best), a pathetically geeky loner who is so socially unskilled that he makes our skin crawl a little. When we first meet him, Elliot is trying to glom onto his co-workers' after-hours social scene by using such tried-and-true means as showing photos of his speakers (from all sides), a truly awful blue-eyed soul brother act, and plain old stalking.Even though he is the guy you run from when he lurches towards you in the hall - probably knocking over the water cooler at the same time - Elliot really does want to be different. One reason for this is his fervent secret crush on Alison (Frances O'Connor), a beautiful systems analyst who doesn't see him at all. Elliot is so smitten by her that he doesn't even realize until too late that she has given him a polite brush off at the local pub, where he is busy trying to impress his buddies.Now comes a simple but nifty transitional shot: a cue ball skips off a pool table and bounces down a flight of stairs and the camera follows as it makes a steady, inevitable trip across the crowded floor, pairs of feet yielding right of way as it goes on to finally hit Elliot's feet where he sits on a stool in silent yearning. He picks up the ball and looks across the room, up the flight of stairs to where destiny, in the form of Elizabeth Hurley in a slinky red dress, is beckoning him.Ms. Hurley is actually the Devil, although Elliot doesn't know it yet, and she will shortly be putting him through a series of transformative experiences. In the meantime, though, he isn't buying her story, even though she presents him with a card that reads, ""The Devil"". Contrasted with the heavy-handedness of recent 'Sign O'the Beast R' Us' flicks such as Devil's Advocate, this sequence is done with sly understatement and depends simply on giving Hurley a chance to play the vamp she was born to be.We begin to like Elliot here because, even though he is presented with a slew of vanity-pleasing enticements, it isn't until she serves up a batch of his grandmother's cookies that he believes the Devil is really who she claims to be. And when he is presented with the standard seven-wishes-for-your-soul contract, it isn't until he sees a giant video screen of Alison calling to him that he makes the deal.Although the real treats - the deliriously goofy incarnations of teeth, hair and clothing that Elliot chooses for his ideal self in his endless quest for happiness, success, and Alison's hand - are yet to come, I am just pointing out how masterfully Ramis has set the table. By the time he is plunged into his voyage of self-improvement, we already know a great deal about Elliot and have begun to move into his corner.We've also begun to feel a certain sympathy for the Devil, thanks mainly to the fine work of Ms. Hurley, with her elegant voice and her clear zest for the role. Although she is certainly not the scariest Lucifer yet to appear on screen, she is one of the most persistently sales-oriented and could hang with the toughest of David Mamet's phone scammers. By turns sultry, pitiful, and practical (""Have you ever even seen your soul? Do you even know what it does? It's really just like your appendix - you'll never miss it.""), she is always the ultimate Closer. Yet it's also never really in doubt that those with a glimmer of goodness can slip the bonds of her contract with no hard feelings on her part.Fraser's Elliot, who is almost always the dupe, is hilariously baffled by the persona the Devil has given him. Plagued in each adventure by the same guys who torment him at the office, he can never figure out what has gone wrong with his wish until it is too late. It's delightful to see this fine actor strutting the comic range he is capable of playing in all of his character's various selves, as well as the simplicity with which he returns to being the same old Elliot, wiser, at the end.Fine supporting work by Orlando Wilson, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss as Elliot's co-workers and karmic cast members. Great script by Ramis, Larry Gelbart of M.A.S.H. and Oh, God, and Peter Tolan (Analyze This, The Larry Sanders Show).",Bedazzled

To my surprise i enjoyed this film there are many funny moments the best when the workmates are involved. The basketball scenes were very funny, Fraser showed he is a capable actor and Hurley did not have to talk, just keep dressing up in the many 'turn on costumes' ( she still can't act).

(The release seems to have been pushed to the end of October, but I'm tired of waiting to comment... thanks to being bombarded with the trailer everywhere.)The cut was complete, other than the video based title sequence, lack of end credits... and a soundtrack that might not have been completely finished. But it does not matter.The movie, overall, is very disappointing.  The ending is dreadful.  There are a few humorous and entertaining moments.  I found virtually all of the ""drug lord"" sequence, which appears early in the film, quite amusing. (This must be common feedback, since the reworked final trailer uses large portions of this sequence.)  But it all goes down-hill from there.  It just doesn't work.  Hollywood garbage.  I'm a fan of the Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original film and I expected more.  Hopefully this remake will spawn a DVD release of the original film.  Save your money for that.If this ""comedy"" does extremely well, I'll lose all faith in the movie-going public.",Bedazzled

Elizabeth Hurley plays a gleeful devil and amply fills out every outfit she wears; but Brendan Fraser steals the show. His acting and characterizations were outstanding.

The script is excellently written.  (There's a painfully funny parody of ""Dawson's Creek"".)  Brendan Fraser is absolutely perfect as the social misfit.  Elizabeth Hurley, as The Devil,  is beautiful, as always, and has the most wonderful costumes and hair.

It has no really good funny jokes in it. It's stupid funny, not funny funny. You'd be better off watching a rerun of the TV show Will and Grace or of Friends. While watching this movie, my mind began to wonder because it was rather boring. The thing I found most interesting was looking at the women's make-up and what shades they used.

The entire movie follows his wishing for what he wants, and always having his wishes turn out badly. While the little wish sketches could have been funny if perhaps Brendan Fraser were say, Jim Carrey, Fraser certainly is not.  In fact, his mellowdrama, doofy guy smile only gets more annoying.  All his wishes are strung together with poor dialogue that first time director Pete Jones, the director of Project Greenlight's Stolen Summer, could improve. Elizabeth Hurly at least is pretty to look at.Overall, all I got from this was the feeling that I could have spent the last 90 minutes on the toilet and be more productive.

An amusing hilarious, motion picture starring Eliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) a sad pathetic bubbly, loser who works at Synednyne technical Support . Who has associates who he thinks are his friends, (Paul Adelstein) as Bob, ( Miriam Shor) as Carol, (Orlando Jones)as Daniel and (Toaby Huss) as Jerry. Eliot thinks that some day there will be a magic wand that will wave around and make everything better  it has come, as a Devil (Elizabeth Hurley). Who gave him only seven wishes for his soul? He is a desperate man, who wants to be with a girl named Alison Gardner (Frances O'Conner). Well he is so desperate for her he actually makes a deal! In his wishes, he wishes to be stronger, more attractive, and wealthy to attract Alison; he realizes it just doesn't work that way because every wish he has had, as became a total nightmare.The acting in this film is admirable. Especially the fact that Brendan Fraser and Frances O'Conner had to change there character about 5 or 6 times and pulled it off pretty well, is amazing I'd say they're talented actors. And since Elizabeth Hurley is in this film, looking her best ever there is no way for a guy to not want to see this film especially with her sassy ever-changing wardrobe. Which makes her look like nothing but, fantastic in every scene.

Liz Hurley then arrives (as the devil), she really is the sexiest woman on the planet and is a sight for sore eyes in this film. She grants him 7 wishes in exchange for his soul after he confesses he would sell it to be with the woman of his dreams. I wont spoil it for you if you haven't already watched this film but it really is a fun film and one which I would recommend you go and see.
