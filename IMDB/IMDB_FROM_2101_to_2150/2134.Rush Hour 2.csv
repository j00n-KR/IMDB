0,TheLittleSongbird,"Excellent sequel, just as exciting as the first!",8,23 June 2009,"This sequel is truly excellent, definitely one of the better sequels to come out, and elevates where the original left off to a greater level. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker return as the double act, and Chan actually does more than he did in the predecessor in terms of action, and consequently is as lovable and vulnerable as always. Chris Tucker is very funny too, yet again his mouth runs away with him. On the most part, the script was perfectly agreeable, though the jokes could have been more fresh, and the plot, while clever and simple, wasn't as involving as the one in the predecessor, though there was an action-packed climax that was very satisfying. Putting these discrepancies aside, the action and the spirited performances from the entire cast, make this a very entertaining sequel. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",Rush Hour 2
1,Leofwine_draca,This action-packed film is by far the best of the series,7,4 November 2016,"I have to say that I viewed the first RUSH HOUR movie as a typically average comedy, but I'm pleased to say that the sequel takes a no-nonsense approach to the action and as such is ten times better. Chan and Tucker are back and far more settled in their roles, particular Tucker who manages to be consistently funny here despite his OTT acting and outrageous dialogue. Chan is funny, too, and particular excellent in the frenetic fight and stunt sequences. To of my favourite moments involve him running up a diagonal bamboo pole and sliding effortlessly through a tiny little hole in a grille; these are classic Chan moments and fans of the actor will lap it up.The fast-moving plot involves a bunch of smugglers and a sexy undercover agent, played by Roselyn Sanchez with relish (perhaps a new Bond girl in the making?). Veteran John Lone (M. BUTTERFLY, and looking better than ever here) shares the criminal duties with newcomer Zhang Ziyi. The resulting pair presents plenty of sparky ego-action and acid dialogue, with Chan and Tucker on the receiving end at most points. The fight scenes take place in massage parlours, boats and there's plenty of fun to be had with parcel bombs and familiar supporting faces in the cast (Kenneth Tsang from THE KILLER, the judge guy from Ghostbusters II and a hilarious Don Cheadle to name but three). The denouement, in a Las Vegas casino, is absolutely brilliant, as Jackie infiltrates the hideout whilst Tucker proves an able diversion by his anti-racism speech at the blackjack table. A fine end to what is a very light and irrelevant, but nevertheless hugely FUN, movie.",Rush Hour 2
2,SnoopyStyle,Chris and Jackie still has some chemistry,6,22 January 2014,Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) invites Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) to vacation in Hong Kong except Lee can't seem to stop working. Then there's a bombing at the US consulate and triad leader Ricky Tan (John Lone) is the immediate suspect. Also they keep running into the beautiful and deadly Hu Li (Ziyi Zhang).Chris Tucker has some cultural fun in Hong Kong. The chicken is especially funny. There is some good action. The bamboo scaffolding is the most memorable. The duo still has some chemistry. Chris making fun of Jackie's English is always funny. However not all the jokes are funny. The constant Chinese conversations and the stone faced Hong Kong extras don't make for funny comedy. It's really only Chris and Jackie making the jokes. I think they need a third.,Rush Hour 2
3,lee_eisenberg,all on their honor,10,17 May 2006,"More of Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan experiencing a series of wacky situations, this time set in Hong Kong, where they uncover a counterfeiting scheme. But the whole movie is really hilarious, namely the mistranslations and the nude scene - not to mention the big showdown and the bloopers. They must really have fun making these kinds of movies. This is what modern classics are all about. Also starring John Lone, Ziyi Zhang, Alan King and Roselyn Sanchez.And to think that there was once a time when people only thought of entertainment as Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Thank God that those days are long gone!",Rush Hour 2
4,jboothmillard,Rush Hour 2,6,28 June 2005,"If you liked the loud mouthed trash talking black guy and the smashing stunt performing martial arts Chinese guy in the first film, then this sequel's good too. Detective James Carter and Chief Inspector Lee (Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan) return for a second rush, Rush Hour 2. A deadly gang are destroying buildings with bombs, and Carter and Lee (originally on vacation) are assigned to find the gang. Lee has the past haunting him during the process, because the gang leader, Ricky Tan (John Lone) killed his Dad. Carter is funny at being loud talking, and Lee is good at all his stunts. Also starring Zhang Ziyi as Hu Li, Roselyn Sanchez as Isabella Molina and Harris Yulin as Agent Sterling. Jackie Chan was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!",Rush Hour 2
5,Tweekums,More laughs with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker,7,21 October 2017,"As this sequel starts LAPD Detective James Carter is in Hong Kong visiting his friend Chief Inspector Lee, of the Hong Kong Police. There plans are interrupted when Lee gets a call informing him of a bombing at the US Consulate General; which killed two agents investigating smuggling. He soon establishes a link to Ricky Tan, a Triad leader who had previously served in the RHKP as the partner of Lee's father who he murdered. Lee confronts Tan on his yacht; it looks as though he is about to ask for protection when he is shot by Hu Li, a beautiful female assassin who worked for him. Carter notices a LA based billionaire hotelier on the yacht so assumes he must be behind whatever Tan had been smuggling. Lee and Carter head to LA, where events lead them to Isabella Molina, a secret service agent they'd first met in Hong Kong; she tells them that she is looking for printing plates for making 'superdollars'; near perfect forged hundred dollar bills. Further events lead them to Las Vegas where they must confront the smugglers.After the success of the first Rush Hour movie a sequel was fairly inevitable. Often sequels are a bit disappointing but thankfully this one was as much fun as the first. The Hong Kong setting for the first half of the film provided plenty of good excuses for amusing incidents as Carter misunderstands the culture or fails in his attempts to speak Chinese. The story is solid enough with a good twist towards the end. As well as lots of laughs there is plenty of impressive action; this is all impressively choreographed. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker have a good chemistry as Lee and Tucker; each bringing something different to the film. Zhang Ziyi really impresses as Hi Li; she may not say much but she is great in the action scenes. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the original film and I look forward to watching 'Rush Hour 3' I hope it is as good as the first two.",Rush Hour 2
6,paul_haakonsen,Great sequel...,8,16 December 2020,"Right, well the 1998 ""Rush Hour"" movie was pretty good and entertaining, so the 2001 sequel ""Rush Hour 2"" definitely had some pretty big shoes to fill.And director Brett Ratner stepped up and steered the movie safely to port. And while doing so in a manner that actually surpassed the 1998 first movie, believe it not. Yeah, I know, a sequel that turned out better than its predecessor.The storyline in ""Rush Hour 2"" was just more enjoyable and entertaining in comparison to the first movie. It felt like more effort had been put into the storyline to provide a movie that had more to offer than just rapid one-liners and impressive stunts. And ""Rush Hour 2"" felt like it was aimed at an audience that was also looking for a bit more than what the first movie offered.True to the first movie, you have an abundance of action, stunts and comedy all rolled up into one, and delivered quite well again by Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. And once again, they are bringing the laughs to the screen. I am very impressed with the chemistry that is between this duo on the screen.""Rush Hour 2"" also has a good cast ensemble, of course with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in the lead roles. But the movie also boasts the talents of Ziyi Zhang, John Lone, Roselyn Sanchez, Alan King, Harris Yulin and Kenneth Tsang. I must admit that I am surprised to see Maggie Q on the cast list, although I didn't see her in the movie.If you enjoyed the 1998 ""Rush Hour"" movie you most certainly will also enjoy the 2001 sequel ""Rush Hour 2"". This is a movie, like almost all of Jackie Chan's movies, that you can watch again and again. My rating of ""Rush Hour 2"" lands on a solid eight out of ten stars.",Rush Hour 2
7,Quinoa1984,Not really worth it,5,6 August 2001,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker (Chan making some of the greatest contemporary martial arts movies ever and Tucker being excellent in Friday and his bit part in Jackie Brown) and when the first Rush Hour came out, I thought it was a good action comedy by taking a winning premise and actors with a story that had in it some real seriousness mixed with great laughs throughout.  Now though, the sequel is out, and the film has made some big mistakes that make this an average movie when it could've been closer to a above average movie.They're are really two mistakes throughout the movie: 1) after a while, Tucker's racial slurs get tiring, not so much as they're not amusing but it's just, well, tiring.  In the first film Tucker had really good lines, but they weren't spoken in every minute of the movie.  It gets just plain stupid to hear te same jokes said even after the humor has been drained out. That movie had it right by giving Chan real control for the fight scenes and there were at least 15 minutes of Chan's unique and awesome kung-fu scenes.  Now though, 2) while they're are spurts of action that make you stand in awe for the moment, it's not enough and director Ratner gives less time for the fight and stunt scenes and more time for Tucker's jibba-jabba, so to speak.Sometimes funny (the out-takes are the funniest part), sometimes exciting, but it's a real downfall from the first one, to definately be sure. Grade: C",Rush Hour 2
8,michaelRokeefe,East meets West via Las Vegas.,6,22 July 2003,"L.A. cop(Chris Tucker)and Asian inspector(Jackie Chan)get together again to bust up a counterfeiting ring and bring chaos to Las Vegas along the way. Tucker and Chan really work well together and have fun doing it. The martial arts scenes are riveting. A worthwhile sequel full of action. Violence, strong language and sexual material are almost obligatory now days. This is fun and exciting to watch.",Rush Hour 2

10,zardoz-13,"""Rush Hour 2"" proves a hundred times more entertaining than its 1998 blockbuster predecessor.",10,8 June 2008,"Actor-comedian Chris Tucker cracks me up every time he tells a joke. He captivated me the first time that I saw him clowning around as the character Smoky in director F. Gary Gray's riotous 'N the Hood' farce ""Friday"" (1995) with Ice-Cube. Tucker attained outlandish heights with his unforgettable coiffure and his loose-lipped loquacity as the ridiculous Ruby Rhod in director Luc Besson's sci-fi extravaganza ""The Fifth Element"" (1997) with Bruce Willis. Anybody that supports the American Rifle Association should praise Tucker, too. In director Brett Ratner's ""Money Talks"" (1997), the Tucker hero, Franklin Hatchett, summed up his philosophy about guns. ""Guns don't kill people,"" Hatchett ranted, ""Stupid motherf*@kers with guns kill people!"" Probably the giddiest moments of director Quentin Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"" (1998) featured nappy headed Tucker arguing with villainous Samuel L. Jackson about climbing in the trunk of Jackson's car. Tucker has rejected movie offers left and rightly largely because nobody wanted to pay his asking price. No matter how astronomical Tucker's salary demands may have seemed, Ice-Cube definitely blew it when he left Smoky out of ""Next Friday."" As a result, ""Next Friday"" pales by comparison with ""Friday."" New Line Cinema, which produced the ""Rush Hour"" thrillers, learned it lesson from Ice-Cube's disaster. Mind you, Mike Epps is funny, but he isn't Chris Tucker funny! Nobody could possibly fill Tucker's shoes in either ""Next Friday"" or ""Rush Hour 2!"" They paid the Def Jam stand-up comic from Decatur, Georgia, a whopping $20-million so he would reprise his ""Rush Hour"" role as LAPD Detective James Carter opposite Jackie Chan in director Brett Ratner's turbo-driven sequel. Producers Arthur Sarkissian, Roger Birnbaum, Jay Stern, and Jonathan Glickman spent their bucks wisely. The comedian chemistry between Tucker and Chan, surely the oddest couple of mismatched cops ever, has lost none of its spontaneity. Altogether, ""Rush Hour 2"" proves a hundred times more satisfying than its tame 1998 blockbuster predecessor.""Rush Hour 2"" opens in exotic Hong Kong as a bomb explodes at the American Embassy, and two translators die. The Royal Hong Kong Police suspect Triad chieftain Ricky Tan (John Lone of ""The Last Emperor"") may have had something to do with the bombing. They send Chief Inspector Lee (Jack Chan of ""Shanghai Noon"") out to question him. Riding with Lee is none other than LAPD Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) who is trying to enjoy his vacation in Hong Kong. Lee tries to make contact with Tan at a karaoke bar while Carter decides to hog the microphone and croon Michael Jackson's ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough."" Carter thought they had entered the bar to pick up girls, and he isn't amused when Lee tells him that they are supposed to be undercover. ""We are in Hong Kong now,"" Lee reminds him. ""Here I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto!"" A disgruntled Carter corrects Lee's malapropism. ""That's Tito, fool. Toto is what we had for dinner last night!"" No sooner has Lee revealed his true intentions than Carter decides to roust the Triad gangsters with his fractured Chinese. ""You just asked them to take out their samurai swords and shave your butt!"" No matter where Lee takes Carter, they wind up surrounded by thugs out to kill them. The best scene in ""Rush Hour 2"" takes place in the Heaven on Earth massage parlor. Lee spots Ricky Tan as he strolls and goes to call for back-up. The impetuous, egotistical Carter decides he can handle Tan alone. He realizes what a dreadful mistake that he has committed when Lee and he battle an entire army of Triad henchmen. The Triads don't kill our heroes. They strip them naked and leave them to fend for themselves in Hong Kong traffic.Happily, not only does ""Rush Hour 2"" boast more cleverly kinetic kung fu combat scenes for Chan, but also ""Speed 2"" scenarist Jeff Nathanson's screenplay concerns an international smuggling ring rather than a child kidnapping case and the thief of Chinese cultural artifacts. Don't get me wrong. Nathanson has contrived an action comedy as formulaic as they come. Clearly, nobody wanted to tinker with the surefire hit so they have beefed up action, plot, and characters while keeping the same situations. When Lee and Carter aren't bickering, they are kicking the crap out of the opposition. We know nothing on earth will prevent our heroes from triumphing over the villains, but the situations are funnier than before. In ""Rush Hour,"" Chan's Chinese cop played the fish-out-of-water in Los Angeles. In ""Rush Hour 2,"" Carter is the fish-out-of-water in Hong Kong. Carter's run-in with a street vendor trying to butcher a chicken for him is a real hoot. Moreover, the adversaries pose a greater challenge. Actress Zhang Ziyi, who electrified audiences as the martial arts maiden in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" excels as a despicable dragon lady who enjoys kicking Carter in his jive-talking mouth. Urbane Jon Lone, who hasn't played a villain since he menaced Christopher Lambert in ""The Hunted"" (1995), registers strongly as the treacherous Ricky Tan. The plot twist is that Tan once served as a Royal Hong Kong policeman; in fact, his partner was none other than Lee's murdered father!""Rush Hour 2"" proves a hundred times more entertaining than its 1998 blockbuster predecessor. Director Brett Ratner keeps the action balanced between Chan and Tucker. Pitting Ziyi against Tucker was a stroke of genius. Ratner wastes no time getting things going at a gung-ho pace and never lets the plot obstruct the action with complications. The opening combat sequence with Chan scrambling up bamboo scaffolding and battling several bad guys lacks the energy that Chan himself might have given had he been at the helm. Ratner redeems himself with the massage parlor fight. This is the fight that they'll have to top in ""Rush 3."" At age 47, Jackie Chan seems half his age, performing front and back flips while using ottomans and trash cans as weapons.",Rush Hour 2
11,Calicodreamin,Funny from beginning to end,10,24 July 2019,"Chan and Tucker are back and better than ever. This is one of the funniest movies ever, the laughs never stop, from the very start to the very end. The storyline has depth but plot is still easily followed. Filled with action packed king fu.",Rush Hour 2
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,More of the same,7,21 November 2008,"Yes, this is a lot like the first. So how you feel about it really depends on how you felt about that. Well, it gets more caricatured some, in areas, but apart from that. The plot isn't bad. It develops fine throughout. The martial arts, and action in general, is fairly entertaining, and those who dig Chan and his style of fighting should find those parts of this quite enjoyable. Similarly, Tucker's mouth has all the silence of an explosion in a closed space. There's plenty of both, so if you go in with at least one of them being among what you hope for getting out of your viewing of this, you can probably count on being satisfied. The music is good. The new additions are mostly positive. Lone and Zhang both fall into that category. Sanchez... well, at least she's not as bad as she tends to be on Without a Trace. The pacing is reasonable. The writing varies, for jokes as well as other material. Again, if Rush Hour was for you, I could imagine you'll feel the same way about this. There is language, and sexuality in this. I recommend this to any fan of Jackie and/or Chris, and the original, and the sequel following this. 7/10",Rush Hour 2
13,view_and_review,Tucker/Chan much better than Wilson/Chan,8,27 June 2007,"""Rush Hour 2"" is one of those timeless classic comedies that I can watch over and over and still find it a riot. Chris Tucker is supremely hilarious to me, and his jokes are only made better with the addition of Jackie Chan. RH2 is one of those rare sequels that is better than the original.Interestingly enough, an Asian columnist (former columnist) used Rush Hour 2 to help support his argument that Black people don't like Asians. I'm sure he was referring to the numerous racially insensitive, or to put it more mildly, stereotype jokes uttered by Chris Tucker. Now, I'm not Asian, so it is not my place at all to say whether or not the jokes were out of line or offensive, but I'll be damned if they weren't funny.RH2 begins in Hong Kong with Carter (Tucker) on vacation while Lee (Chan) continues to work cases. Lee catches a big case when someone blows up the U.S. embassy and kills two secret service agents.The movie rotates back to L.A. where it all started in the first ""Rush Hour."" There, Carter and Lee continue their hunt for Ricky Tan (John Lone) and others. It's more action and more hilarity especially involving Carter and main henchwoman Hu Li (Ziyi Zhang, famously from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"").Chris Tucker is just such a damn nut case that he can say almost anything and it's funny. I've been a fan of his comedy and humor ever since I saw him do stand up on Def Comedy Jam. RH2 was a perfect blend of action and comedy that made the movie a smash and revitalized the buddy cop tandem. I just can't wait for ""Rush Hour 3.""",Rush Hour 2
14,ferguson-6,"Could have been titled, ""Rush Hour AGAIN""",5,5 August 2001,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Brett Ratner (""Rush Hour"" and ""The Family Man"") is back with this formulaic remake that utilizes memorable lines from the original by different characters.  Obviously this was made for the money.  Despite this fact, there are a few points of interest.  Most notably is the Ziyz Zhang in her first role since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  She has amazing screen presence ... if only she could speak English!  Hopefully more directors will find a way to utilize her talents in spite of the language barrier.  Also, the rarely seen John Lone is back as a villain. He may be best remembered from his stunning performance in 1985's ""Year of the Dragon"".  I must question the casting of both Don Cheadle and Alan King.  My guess is that Ratner owed King a favor and Cheadle owed Ratner one.  Relative newcomer Roselyn Sanchez has some intrigue, but her role was so poorly defined in this movie, one cannot jump to any conclusions regarding her talent.  Otherwise, much of the same from this one with the obvious exception that the decision was made to put Chris Tucker front and center and Jackie Chan as the straight guy.  A little too much of Tucker's ""in your face"" humor for my tastes.",Rush Hour 2
15,Wizard-8,Hated it,1,4 August 2001,"I only though the first ""Rush Hour"" was so-so, so after hearing the sequel was better, I went in with high expectations. Boy, was I let down.
First of all, only about a third of the movie takes place in Hong Kong - instead of staying with this new and fresh setting, the movie then takes us back to the U.S. Second, there is not much plot, and when there is, it's a bit murky. Some details (such as the explanation for the ""Snoopy"" tattoo) seem to have been lost in the editing room.But the biggest problem I had was with Chris Tucker. Somewhat overbearing in the first movie, here he grows to be thoroughly obnoxious, loud, and racist to boot. In almost every scene, his dialogue (and how he enunciates it) left me cringing. He is the true ""Ugly American"", and not the least bit funny. And unfortunately, there is more focus on him than Chan. Though since Chan isn't given anything funny for himself, at least he doesn't look as bad as he could have been.The only way this movie is better than the first is with the fight sequences - there are more fights, and they are better choreographed. Though they are still not as good as in Chan's HK movies. I can't wait for ""The Accidental Spy"" to be released this Christmas so I can get rid of the bad taste of ""Rush Hour 2"".",Rush Hour 2
16,anaconda-40658,Don't Rush Out To See This One Either.,2,11 August 2015,"Rush Hour 2 (2001): Dir: Brett Ratner / Cast: Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Zhang Ziyi, Harris Yulin, John Lone: Mindless noise bent on capturing the same success as the first film, which in itself wasn't that good. A bomb goes off at the American Embassy killing two agents and Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are interrupted on their Hong Kong vacation to deal with it. They seek out a gang called the Triads whose leader is apparently responsible for the death of Chan's father. Director Brett Ratner effectively combines action and humour within a screenplay that presents absolutely no reason to bother with it. He previously made such films as Family Man and Money Talks as well the the first Rush Hour. This is just a time filling waste. Tucker is downright racist with foul mouth dialogue that recites every racial slur within reach. Chan is exhilarating with the stunts but that pretty much sums it up. He kicks ass and puts up with Tucker's bullshit. Zhang Ziyi is unfortunately flat as the villain and that is unfortunate since she gave an electrifying performance in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It presents the stunts but never a screenplay worth filming. It is the umpteenth buddy cop movie like many others seen every year. Some are well done while others, such as this one, just plainly suck. It is the kind of film that should be tossed into the ocean in hopes that it will sink to far to be found.

It is at this point in the film when all kinds of problems start to take place, and the bad guy who is in on all sorts of rackets comes face to face with Inspector Lee and the stunts and all kinds of action is enacted through out the entire picture.

18,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I've seen it 4 times, and it still makes me laugh!",9,3 September 2001,"Rush Hour 2 is one of those rare sequels that turn out to be either just as just as much if not equally more hilarious than the first. This summer, I had several opportunities to see this film and of course took those chances because I just couldn't stop laughing at this film, no matter how I knew what would happen in the next scene. It has great humor and great chemistry that we haven't seen between two actors since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.Carter and Lee are back and starting off where the first Rush Hour left off and that's in China. Carter is expecting a dream vacation full of ""mushoo's"" a.k.a girls! Lee is standing in the way of that though taking on his old cases, including finding out about a counterfeit scam, and finding out who killed his father. He fools Carter several times, but together eventually team back to discover that you just ""follow the rich white man"" back to America and end up working undercover with the sexy Isabella Molina. But things get deeper as Lee finds out that the counterfeit scam and his father's killer might to be connected.Rush Hour 2 is one of the funniest movies I have seen, not to mention one of the best movies of the year!

Chan seems unmotivated and Tucker is downright annoying while stunts and fight sequences are ordinary, the plot silly and sophomoric, and the sentimental moments just plain don't work. The whole film smacks of a throw-together with the only possible motive being scramming the public out of the price of admission.

Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) and Detective James Carter (Tucker) are on vacation in Hong Kong, but Lee is distracted with police work and becomes embroiled in a counterfeiting case involving Hong Kong Triad Leader Ricky Tan (John Lone) and his beautiful but evil assistant Hu Li (Ziyi Zhang). Soon, Lee and Carter's vacation are spoiled and they end up in another rush to solve a high-profile case which involves the U.S. Secret Service.The hilarious game of culture clash, mismatch and quick humor of Lee and Carter continues. There is an endless supply of racial and racy comments coming from Tucker's motormouth and never-ending quick wit and action coming from Lee, but, like's its prequel, there is great chemistry between Chan and Tucker as they deliver another laughable and entertaining comedy. There are also more gags in this film than the previous, including the crazy scene where Chan and Tucker are stripped naked by the villains and are sent running around the streets in Hong Kong, and in the scenes where Tucker tries to speak Cantonese.The two female leads were a real treat in the film - gorgeous femme fatale Hu Li that is mercilessly evil and sly and cunning and the beautiful double agent Isabella Molina (Roselyn Sanchez) that is charming and no-nonsense. It was great to see them on screen together during the kidnapping and fight scenes; however, I just wished their one-on-one duel would have been longer.I especially enjoyed seeing many of the Hong Kong city scenes and the appearance of Hong Kong movie legends such as Kenneth Tsang (Captain Chin), John Lone (Ricky Tan) and members of Jackie Chan's stunt team.Overall, another great rush! Grade B+",Rush Hour 2
23,thesar-2,Rush to see this one 2,8,17 March 2010,"Though not as great as the original – they clearly knew the duo (Chan/Tucker) had some excellent chemistry in part 1 and thoroughly exploited it – Rush Hour 2 still was actually pretty darn good. And they up'd the ante by sending Tucker into Chan's territory, a reverse from part 1, but also dove deeper into the two's friendship & loyalty.Taking off immediately where part one left off – okay, a few days, LAPD cop Carter (Tucker) is vacationing with workaholic Lee (Chan) in Hong Kong where they unravel a plot of counterfeit money involving Lee's deceased father's ex-partner and crime lord, Tan (Lone.) This sends our newest/favorite buddy/cop duo across the globe from Hong Kong to LA to Las Vegas.Along the way, you still get Chan's impressive and original stunts, Tucker's humor still intact and wonderful guest appearances. Cheadle was wonderful but Piven had me rolling.Again, just as part one, it contained its flaws, including the widely unrealistic portrayal of Vegas and how far these two could go without so much as being immediately expelled from a casino, but if you sit back and enjoy, they kept it as fresh as the first and you will fall in love with these friends all over again.Highly recommended for fans of part 1, action/adventure and comedy enthusiasts and definitely for people addicted to both Chan and Tucker films.",Rush Hour 2

I'll admit Chris Tucker got annoying after a while with his high-pitched voice. But, Jackie Chan and the villains entertained me for the whole movie.This takes place when the two cops are having a vacation in Hong Kong. Then the American Embassy gets bombed and they get framed for it. Now they have to play a game of cat and mouse to catch the bad guys.Overall, this is a pretty solid action/comedy movie. I liked the third one better though. But this is good enough. I rate this movie 8/10.",Rush Hour 2
26,lesleyharris30,"Just as Good as it's Predecessor,",8,9 July 2014,"Rush Hour 2 is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a great comedic cast.I personally think fans of the first Rush Hour will not be disappointed,don't expect it to be much better,but it's just as good as the first.In certain aspects it has improved,the chemistry between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker seemed a lot more genuine this time around rather than just acting and Chan's comedy acting has improved,in the first one you could tell English wasn't his first language and he didn't seem use to delivering comedic lines either,but he clearly got use to it after doing movies like the first Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon and really is use to acting in comedies now.As it is with the first,Chris Tucker is the highlight,a lot of his lines are clearly improvised and that's what makes so many of his scenes so funny.Rush Hour 2 is a very enjoyable movie that fans of the first will be impressed with and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy or action. The LA cop and martial arts expert reunite once more to investigate an explosion at Hong Kong's US embassy.Best Performance: Chris Tucker",Rush Hour 2

29,The-Sarkologist,Don't expect classic Jackie,7,29 April 2017,"I probably should mention that if you are watching this film because you are a fan of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong films then unfortunately you are probably going to be really, really disappointed. However, since it is now (as of this writing) sixteen years since this film first hit the screens then you are probably already quite aware of that. Mind you, when I first watched Chan's Hollywood exploits I was quite disappointed, but then again that did have a lot to do with me expecting them to be a lot more like his Hong Kong films as opposed to them simply being another of the many Hollywood films that hit out screens every year.Anyway, this film pretty much begins straight after the previous film ends, though I wouldn't have picked it up if I hadn't watched the first film earlier today (the first film ends with Chris Rock heading off to Hong Kong for a long deserved vacation, and this film begins with him in Hong Kong on the said vacation). So, as is the case with pretty much every cop movie that has come out of tinsel town, our heroes simply cannot get a rest because they immediately find themselves dragged into another case. This one involves the US Embassy in Hong Kong being blown up, and Chan being dragged into the midst of the investigation.In a sense this film seems to focus quite a lot on Chan's (or should I say Lee because that is the character he is playing) backstory where we discover who his father was and what happened to his father's partner. However, for some reason, which we aren't given a backstory for Rock, neither of the films seemed to actually revolve around him – it felt as if he was simply the American element that was being used to bring Chan, a legend of the Hong Kong cinema, to the American audience.The other interesting thing is that the first time I saw this film I hadn't been to Hong Kong, so the place was basically quite exotic. However, having been there twice now, it suddenly gives me a new perspective on the film, and the names and locations are no longer alien. In fact I find myself, particularly in the opening parts of the film, noting where the various shots are being taken (and it seems as if little had changed between 2001 and 2011 when I first step foot on its shores).However, that is a bit of a side note, and as for this film all I can really say is that Rush Hour is basically your typical American buddy cop film. If you liked Lethal Weapon you probably will enjoy this film. Mind you, I did find that Chris Rock was trying to be too much like Eddie Murphy and as far as I'm concerned there can only ever be one Eddie Murphy, but then again that has a lot more to do with my 80s bias and my age as opposed to anything to do with the film. Hell, it does, and it does detract from it a lot.",Rush Hour 2
30,briancham1994,A bit better than the first,6,3 June 2020,This film is a slight improvement on the first Rush Hour. It has essentially the same elements but with a more engaging plot. The action is great as usual. Chris Tucker is annoying as usual.,Rush Hour 2
31,Anonymous_Maxine,More of the same,7,7 August 2001,"Rush Hour 2 is pretty much a continuation of the first Rush Hour, which is not entirely a bad thing. Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are back in Chan's latest east meets west action comedy, which is another goofball comedy interspersed with what is meant to be a relatively serious crime story. Structurally, Rush Hour 2 is almost identical to the first Rush Hour, which is bad in its redundancy, but good in that it is almost as entertaining and amusing as the first one was. As is almost always the case with comedy sequels like this (take the Austin Powers films as another perfect example), there is a lot of comedy from the original that is turned around or repeated in the sequel, either complementing on or feeding on the success of the original. One of Chris Tucker's lines from Part 1 (`Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?!'), for example, is now spoken by Jackie Chan, in an amusing scene that clearly makes good fun of Chan's English speaking skills.
The astonishingly beautiful Zhang Ziyi, of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fame, plays the role of one of the villains in the Chinese gang, and although she is a welcome addition to the film, Rush Hour 2 is clearly below her level of acting skill and presence. There are some excellent fighting scenes with her, which is good because even Jackie Chan's fast paced and often hilarious fight scenes seem to have met their match with the usually faster and often better moves seen in Jet Li's films. One can only wonder how long it will be before the two are in a film together. Now THAT I'd like to see.With action comedies like this, there is an almost universal lack of anything new. They are almost always formulaic, and it was a relief to see that there was some innovation here. I've seen a lot of movies like this, but I have to admit that I've never seen one that involves a Ying Tao grenade taped inside someone's mouth. That was a pretty good scene. There are some more smart-ass lines from Tucker about black people and Chinese people (`Don't ever get in front of a black man while he's standing at a buffet line!') that could have and probably should have been left out, but as a whole, it's a fun movie. And as s the case with most slapstick comedies and Jackie Chan films, the outtakes at the end were some of the funniest parts of the movie.",Rush Hour 2
32,elshikh4,Jackie Chan & The Buddy Formula !,6,7 December 2009,"I love this script. It provided us with non-stop action, new consecutive places, some twists, and more funny lines. I only hated the matter of ""They killed my father""; as that was corny! (Ziyi Zhang) and (Roselyn Sanchez) were fine. (Chris Tucker) seemed, and thank God for that, less annoying. (Jackie Chan), as he himself said in the bloopers, ""is always OK"", and always fun to watch. If only you love him from his Hong Kong movies, you'll be surprised with kind of serious feel, or let's say not so funny stuff, related to him. In one scene, the 2 leads go to talk to the hotel's reception, in Hong Kong (Chan) would have handled it comically, here, it's (Tucker)'s exclusive task. Yes, there are many amusing fights between the 2 partners, plus the amusing real fights of (Chan) apart. But you must notice; it's new ballgame. And you know what? This is the way to play it.(Chan) strived to be a star in Hollywood, but with so unsuccessful try after another. Since the early 1980s, and for more than 15 years later, he was forced to be Bruce Lee (The Big Brawl - 1980), Dirty Harry (The Protector - 1985), James Bond (First Strike - 1996), a spoof of himself (Cannonball Run - 1981) and (Cannonball Run II - 1984).. namely anything but himself. I bet they were afraid that his kind of comedy, which was working in the other half of the world, would not work in their market. Not to mention that when they already allowed him to be himself, in (Rumble in the Bronx - 1995), the movie didn't turn to be a hit. So through (Rush Hour) he, or they, brought the American (Tucker) to undertake the mission of comedy, throwing funny lines and acting as the fool; being the stereotype droll black sidekick, however too talkative this time to mantle (Chan)'s bad English. All of that while (Chan) does what not many American stars, rather no American stars, can do; the brisk kicks. It was like finding out the thing that was missing the most. Because this ""Buddy"" formula proved itself as the best indeed after the movie became a 1998 hit, well, (Chan)'s first hit in America to be precise.Thereafter he would repeat the same formula in different atmosphere (Shanghai Noon - 2000). Then in the sequels (Rush Hour 2 - 2001) and (Shanghai Knights - 2003). Strangely (Chan)'s movies - away from this - weren't a success; such as (The Tuxedo - 2002) and (The Medallion - 2003). Even when he returned to the buddy-movies again, however as the funny one in the dual, the movie (Around the World in 80 Days - 2004) flopped miserably in the box-office. So he had to make (Rush Hour 3 - 2007). You can see the whole picture when you notice how free the man is when he makes movies at his homeland between the breaks of working in America, such as (Xin jing cha gu shi or ""New Police Story"" - 2004), (San wa or ""The Myth"" - 2005), and the most serious (Xin Su shi jian or ""The Shinjuku Incident"" - 2009).Maybe I'm wrong, but that what can be read about the situation by reviewing the past 30 years. So, if you're a great fan of (Pao Pao), then surely you'll miss some elements from his old movies, like seeing him as a sole hero for instance, but this is another country, another rules. And he did it well. Especially in this movie where he wasn't forced to use the awful flying wires. So the size of concessions weren't that nocuous this round. And that's why I have a respect for this one more than (Chan)'s other Hollywood flicks. Another affirmation for the fact that (Chan) did it well: (Rush Hour 2) is better sequel than its original. Better sequel? Here's a new word for you!Angry P.S: Why there is a shot for a nude man's butt in this? I read in the IMDb's Parents Guide section that the nudity was for a comedic effect (Huh!!). Basically, how come that there is nudity while the movie is just PG-13?! Anyway, it's mean and disgusting whatever its justification was!",Rush Hour 2
33,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,1 August 2019,"OK, for those of you who, like me, liked Rush Hour, do yourselves a favor and stay away from this.What we have here is basically Lethal Weapon 4 set in Hong Kong rather than LA. And... it just doesn't work.Everything (save the stars) that made the first one funny is kind of out of place and forgotten. It's horrible. The fish out of water scenario fits well in Rush Hour, but set in Hong Kong, Tucker comes across as obnoxious instead of funny.It's horrible.",Rush Hour 2
34,dee.reid,Get Ready For Another Rush!,10,4 August 2001,"Rush Hour 2 opens up where the first Rush Hour left off with Inspector Lee(Jackie Chan) and Detective Carter(Chris Tucker) going off to China. When a terrorist bombing kills two American translators, the Chinese police offer Inspector Lee the case, who accepts, and Detective Carter, who is supposed to be on vacation, is reluctantly pulled into another wild adventure with Lee.  This time the bad guys are a group of counterfeiters led by Ricky Tan(John Lone), a former friend of Lees who has certain mob ties and who was also his late father's partner.  Now Rush Hour 2 is a lot funnier than I thought it was going to be.  I sat there and laughed my butt off.  Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker have terrific chemistry on screen and the two really make a good crime-fighting duo.  I would also like to comment on Ziyi Zhang(Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) who plays plays Hu Li, a beautiful, but deadly assassin.  She, I think she was pretty dangerous in this movie and she performs a lot of the cool martial arts moves she displayed in Crouching Tiger.  She and Chris Tucker have many encounters and up until the ending Chris says he won't hit a woman, but guess what, he does and I was also disappointed that (spoiler) Hu Li died in the end.  Another aspect that I was disappointed with was that I thought Clive(Chris Penn) the guy from the first film that Carter busted for having C-4, would appear in this movie, but he doesn't.Anyway, Rush Hour 2 surpasses the first film in many ways it is a lot funnier than the first one too. 8/10",Rush Hour 2

Reign (Alan King) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've seen this movie. I got really scared when the embassy was blown up at the beginning of the movie and when other unexpected thrilling things happened. To me, Carter (Chris Tucker) and Lee (Jackie Chan) were very tough and funny guys. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you like Chris Tucker or Jackie Chan films, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish.",Rush Hour 2

37,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Slightly more entertaining than the first,9,29 August 2012,"""Buddy Cop"" genre films require a lot of attention no matter if it's the first or third installment. The first Rush Hour (1998) I found fairly entertaining because of its relationship between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker's opposite like personalities. Of course, this is the defining element of these kinds of movies. But it worked so well for this franchise not just because Chan is Chinese and Tucker's American, but because how extremely opposite their version of negotiations are denoted as. Carter (Tucker) is more upfront, while Lee (Chan) is more diplomatic, that is until he's forced to be upfront when Carter drags him into trouble.The sequel to Rush Hour (1998) is just as entertaining if not slightly more because some of the bad things I mentioned in my review for the first film have been omitted for this one. Right after the first film, Carter and Lee are now in China, for vacation, and end up trailing on another bad guy's tail. The villain this time is Ricky Tan played by John Lone. Lone plays his character just as sinister as from The Shadow (1994) and that's good. It shows that he hasn't lost touch with playing evil characters.The stereotypical jokes are still in this film just like the last one but they seem to be funnier than before. Maybe that's because Jackie Chan's the one saying them? I'm not sure. Also the lack of communication between Lee and Carter are funny too. Too see both characters bewildered at the same time and have no clue what's going on is a total knee-slapper. I got more laughs than I did for the first and that's saying something. The action was great and music by Schifrin was still entertaining.The first installment to Rush Hour (1998) is actually more fun than the first but it still could be funnier without the constant crude jokes.",Rush Hour 2
38,PredragReviews,"""I'll kick you back to Africa!""",8,11 June 2016,"If you loved the first Rush Hour, you will love this one as well. This is an action pack movie with Jackie Chan's amazing stunt work and Chris Tucker's amazing comedic presence. This is a very very funny and entertaining movie. Movie also stars Roselyn Sanchez, and the gorgeous Zhang Ziyi of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon fame as a crazed assassin. Zhang is great in this movie and some of the action scenes are amazing as well as funny. The story doesn't matter because basically it's this - Carter talks funny to somebody while Lee is distracted, it then all kicks off and Lee does lots of fancy moves, it then moves to a different location and the pattern repeats again. Essentially that's it - but it doesn't matter, it worked the first time and it works again here. The story is better than the first film's, although the twists don't work as well as they think they do.The main improvement since the first movie is that there's more fighting action. In RH Jackie Chan's fighting was toned down to make room for Tucker's comedy. In RH2 Chan is allowed to have much more action and the addition of Zhang Ziyi ups the ante all the more. Tucker still gets to do his big-mouthed comedy and have plenty of banter between him and Chan, be sexual with girls and fight. It's not breaking new ground but it's quite fun. Chan and Tucker are very good, mainly because they're having fun and comfortable with each other. Lone adds class and menace as Ricky Tan and Sanchez adds spice as the beautiful Isabella. The best addition is Zhang Ziyi - she doesn't have any character but she can certainly move! The cast also has very funny cameos from Don Cheadle and Jeremy Piven - adding laughs and class. The only problem with the film is that it is so very formulaic and is just a simple crowd pleaser. Some of the banter is a few steps off racism and much of Tucker's ogling is borderline sexism. However, it's all so very polished that you don't notice.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Rush Hour 2
39,eric262003,Has The Same Laughs Like In The First Film,7,6 December 2015,"Even though the setting and the plot of ""Rush Hour 2"" makes no difference in the fun and excitement from the original 1998 ""Rush Hour"", starring the dynamic duo of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. After all they still convey awesome chemistry together the action and stunts are just as if even more fun to watch it'll make your heads feel dizzy. But like in the first ""Rush Hour"" movie, the action and the stunts usurp the storyline once again. The plot once again lack in anything original, however this time around, the villains and the supporting performers are lowered to more questionable purposes. In the sequel we find Detective James Carter (Tucker) and Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) are on sabbatical in China but are actually on a police investigation which are vital clues to Lee's father's mysterious death many years ago. In a vicarious situation, Lee and Carter have become involved in an American Embassy bombing conspiracy and have become focal targets to a diabolical faction called The Triad led by crime lord Ricky Tan (John Lone). This mystery leads our heroes from China, back to Los Angeles and then to Nevada to unravel the mystery behind this conspiracy. While Tucker and Chan are still equally dynamic as they were before, with Chan's high-flying and laid-back character that's contrary to Tucker's non-stop blabbering, the comedy and the action are are both handed out in equal proportions. One of the big differences is that in ""Rush Hour 2"" Carter is the foreigner here. One of the newer refreshing elements to this sequel is that Carter has now taken an interest for The Beach Boys and Lee has found a greater appreciation for hip-hop music. The same schtick involving racial barriers is continued here, more than before mind you, and Tucker's quick-witted one-liners will likely make you laugh till you wet your pants. Some of the more funnier scenes take place in a karaoke bar, at a massage parlour and some seductive interactions with Secret Agent Isabella Molina (Rosalyn Sanchez). While the jokes are pretty much still the same as before, it's still all in good fun, even if there's not enough material to spawn a sequel, let alone a trilogy like in 2007. While Don Cheadle and Jeremy Piven are amazing in their cameo roles, I found the primary weakness comes from the less than stellar supporting cast and villains. Sanchez comes across as playing an important role here as Secret Agent Isabella, but the subplots involving this sultry spy feels awkward and not very well received. Sure a strong female supporting protagonist would be a great addition to our heroes, however Isabella's role falls stale and lacks the integrity this role greatly needs. Zhang Ziyi as one of the Triad's villainous' Hu Li may provide some seductive evilness to the plot, sadly her scenes were few and far between and seems to lack in character development. Meanwhile John Lone as the leading bad guy here is just like the first villain in the series, very formulaic and clichéd and lacks the charisma to really hold one's interest. Even the fight scenes and the climax feels just like seeing the first installment without really offering anything new to the series. Even the bad guy's demises in the end repeats itself. ""Rush Hour 2"" is an exciting, light on the brains action- comedy that will surely entertain you for the next 90 minutes. The main flaw is a lot of things stay the same and very little changes. Still anyone who enjoyed the first film will surely enjoy this sequel but there is no need to watch the first one before watching the second film. Once the credit roll, don't leave your seats. The bloopers will surely make you laugh your heads off. It's like the dessert after finishing the main course.",Rush Hour 2

41,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Rush Hour 2"" suffers from a contrived script of clichés, conveniences and a lack of focus, but is salvaged by its charming leads and some decent doses of humor and action.",6,24 November 2013,"The original ""Rush Hour"" is one of the surprise delights of the 1990's- a fun, fast and well-made ""buddy cop"" film that charmed audiences with its humor and the great chemistry between leads Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. It was a big hit, so a sequel or two seemed like a no-brainer. And indeed two sequels (so far, at least) were produced. The first of which was 2001's ""Rush Hour 2."" And really, this film is indicative of the problems all three entries in the series face- an over-reliance on clichés, contrivances, coincidences and lazy storytelling. However, whereas the first film was able to rise above a fairly formulaic script and deliver a good film, this sequel isn't quite able to rise above it's almost embarrassingly by-the-numbers screenplay, and comes off as a much more average film than the original.Detective Carter (Tucker) is visiting his friend Detective Lee (Chan) in Hong Kong. While Carter is hoping for a few weeks of fun, food and women, Lee is hard at work on several cases. When a bomb goes off at an American Consulate building in Hong Kong, and it appears that Ricky Tan (John Lone), a man with a dark connection to Lee's past, is connected, Lee and Carter get involved in the case. And it leads to- you guessed it- action, action and more action.To give the film credit where it is due, the acting is uniformly great, much as it was in the original. Chan is given a slightly more personal motivation in the story this time, and it allows him to stretch his acting chops (and his martial arts and stunt work) moreso than the first film. Tucker is a lot of fun, though this film made him into too much of a cartoon character at times. Many people (myself included) have noted that he goes too far and comes off as a bit on the annoying side in this film. But still, he has some great jokes that land, and his chemistry with Chan is undeniable.Supporting roles by the likes of John Lone, Roselyn Sanchez and Harris Yulin are all played well. And Zhang Ziyi as a ruthless, silent assassin is great. While she is almost nothing more than a surrogate for the ""Sang"" character in the original film, she is able to give her own spin to the role and plays it well- coming across as savage, sexy and very, very cool.The production is also decent. Brett Ratner's direction is simple, concise and a lot of fun for the most part, although it feels slightly more formulaic this time around. However, the music by Lalo Schifrin is once again a revelation- feeling both old-fashioned yet also modern, giving it a timeless, fun feel. The set and costume design is nice, and the cinematography is fantastic. Setting this film predominately in Hong Kong did allow for some stunning visuals, and it does help.However, the script is where this film really starts to fall apart, and it's the main reason why I am giving this film such a lower rating than I did for the original.The script from the first film did have a problem with clichés, tropes and a formulaic nature, but the script felt creative and fresh enough to elevate itself past this problem, and bring the production to a good level. Not so this time around, sadly. The script by Jeff Nathanson is pretty darned foul. Yes, it's hard to believe that the same man who wrote Spielberg's very fun films ""Catch Me If You Can"" and ""The Terminal"" was also responsible for the unforgivably lazy ""Rush Hour 2."" (And ""Rush Hour 3"", but more on that in a later review)I don't know if it was fear on Nathanson's part to take any chances, or perhaps studio pressure to deliver a ""safe"", formulaic film, but the script is bad. Really bad. Jokes are often lowest-common-denominator. You can see every twist and turn from a mile away. Characters are completely undeveloped beyond being ""good guys"" or ""bad guys."" It spends too much time referencing the first film. It's just a lazy, lazy script. You don't even need to see the film to know what happens. Just think of any other buddy cop movie, and substitute in Chan and Tucker, and you have ""Rush Hour 2.""And it's a shame, because it's the one big problem in an otherwise decent sequel. Thankfully, the good performances and the chemistry between Chan and Tucker are able to pretty much make up for this issue. But just barely.""Rush Hour 2"" gets a slightly above average 6 out of 10 from me. Fans of the original should check it out, but don't go in expecting much.",Rush Hour 2

That is a song that Detective James Carter(Chris Tucker) and Chief inspector Lee(Jackie Chan) dance to throughout the entire Rush Hour trilogy. But what is Rush Hour 2 good for? It's a pretty silly sequel. With a contrived plot that doesn't really matter. Brett Ratner just tries to make the film big and give a lot of funny lines or moments. The only good funny moments are from Chris Tucker. Tucker is mostly the only reason to watch the series period. As I said in my original Rush Hour review, Jackie Chan can't act at all. In Rush Hour 2, he is given these awful lines that he just screws up. Just read this, this is a conversation that Lee and Carter have. ""You said it was a bomb!"" "" No I said she was the bomb!"" ""She was the bomb?"" If you've actually seen the film, then it's a lot more painful to listen to. Jackie Chan is the reason why this is the weakest film in the series. He is given so many lines like that and screw them up because he's not funny and can't act. I just think that Rush Hour 2 is a silly sequel that would be a solid 7 if it wasn't so silly. I did like Rush Hour 2, but it wasn't a great film. None of the Rush Hour films are great, but I like them.The Plot: In the sequel to the hit Rush Hour, Lee and Carter travel to Hong Kong right after the first film just ended. While there, they get caught up in a counterfeits scam which is behind Ricky Tan, a man who killed Lee's father.",Rush Hour 2
46,TheUnknown837-1,tremendous fun,7,27 January 2008,"I described the first ""Rush Hour"" as one of the best comedy-action flicks of them all and stated that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, when combined as a karate-kicking, speed-talking duo for the screen, force the audience into embracing the film. While ""Rush Hour 2"" does not perform the aforemtioned effect as effectively as the first ""Rush Hour"", the second installment in the series is, undeniably, still a lot of fun.What we see in ""Rush Hour 2"" is pretty much the same as what we were given in the first film. Lots of karate fights, amazing stuntwork, loads of funny jokes from comedian Chris Tucker, plentiful amounts of violence but not too an overpowering level, and above all, tremendous entertainment. ""Rush Hour 2"" is in no way, a masterpiece, but it's a barrel-full of fun that delivers and performs effectively.",Rush Hour 2

48,mstomaso,Fun film with big personalities and plenty of action,6,29 December 2005,"Action-comedy legend Jackie Chan teams up with the amusing Chris Tucker in this off-beat sequel to the 1998 hit, Rush Hour. Both actors create likable characters with slightly more depth to them than the average comedic archetypes. Tucker is a loudmouthed clown from the LAPD, and Chan is a quiet, methodical Chief Inspector from Hong Kong. Not just racial stereotypes, their characters are developed just enough to make you want more from them - particularly Chan's.The plot begins to develop in earnest about 1/3rd of the way through the film and takes a few predictable twists and turns until reaching a climactic conclusion. John Lone plays Chan's father's former police partner and the leader of the Triads - a huge Hong Kong gang. He plays his character like a Chinese Chris Walken and, along with Ziyi Zhang, his beautiful but psychotic partner, provides a nice dramatic balance to the lunatic Tucker and straight-man Chan. The story evolves to expose a counterfeiting plot in which the Triad, the US Secret Service, and others are all somehow involved.Chan and Tucker have great chemistry and, with a good supporting cast, they make this sequel work. Rush Hour 2 is a fun, lightweight action film suitable for teens on up.",Rush Hour 2

Just having watched them back to back now, this one was more fun and entertaining. The jokes are funnier and more polished, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker have found really good on-screen chemistry and action scenes are a bit more ""Jackie Chan"" than the first one. Maybe Hollywood gave him a bit more freedom after the success of the first one? In any case, I rate it a 7/10 like the first one because it's not quite an 8/10 but if I could I'd rate it a 7.5.",Rush Hour 2
50,vip_ebriega,Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker go for another 'Rush'.,8,22 June 2008,"My Take: Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is the very reason to see this hilarious action comedy. It's rare of a sequel to live up to its predecessor, and most especially if it's a comedy. Comedy sequels tend to rehash and reuse every gag from the original with no hint of originality. Now, I haven't seen the original RUSH HOUR as of now, but I'd bet it wouldn't be much of a difference from RUSH HOUR 2. But who cares? I liked this movie. It's the old cop-buddy formula to be sure, but the execution of the whole film is exactly what I have come to expect from it. Big laughs, neat stunt choreography by Jackie Chan and even neater wit, RUSH HOUR 2 makes good use of recycled material.After the events that I'm not aware of in the first film, Inspector Lee (Chan) and his American cop partner James Carter (Chris Tucker) are at their vacation in Hong Kong. Their vacation gets tangled up when they are assigned to investigate on an oriental crime boss Ricky Tan (John Lone) involved in a counterfeit money scam. Tan happens to be Lee's father's former cop partner, who also happens to be part of the reason for his father's death. Once again, Tucker as Carter quips more puns and lines, mostly during his confrontations with the silent but deadly warrior (played by Zhang Ziyi), wonderfully choreographed by the way.Director Brett Ratner is a real mess-maker, but he sure as hell has a lot fun with this wild and wacky comedy. Some of the jokes are borrowed material, but majority of it, thanks mainly to its deliverers Chan and Tucker, really work. The action scenes are fast-paced and great, but the film's pot of gold is the comedy, and it shines.Rating: **** out of 5.",Rush Hour 2
51,Bob-45,"Hilarious, Superior Sequel",8,9 January 2002,"Everyone associated with Rush Hour 2, but particularly Chris Tucker, deserves kudos for ""Rush Hour 2"", which is in every way superior to the first ""Rush Hour"". Ziyi Zhang continues to impress here as she did in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" both with her martial arts and acting skills, giving an edge to what could have been a two dimensional role. As Isabella, Roselyn Sanchez can best be described as ""awesome'.  She brings depth to a character that could easily have been reduced to abadge stuck on a great body.This is no retread, see it.",Rush Hour 2
52,jon.h.ochiai,Don't leave before the credits...,8,10 September 2001,"""Rush Hour 2"" is very derivative, and yet very entertaining. The re-teaming of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as Lee and Carter, along with great action and great looking women makes up for a retread of the first movie. Jackie Chan is very charming, and does some amazing action and fighting sequences. Chris Tucker is truly funny on screen, and is a great foil to Chan. John Lone is effective in the simplistic bad guy role. Ziyi Zhang (from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) as ""hench women"", Hu Li, is beautiful and deadly. What distinguishes the movie is the 5 minutes of out takes during the closing credits. Arguably this is the funniest, and best part of the movie. This is also an indictment of the writing. Chan and Tucker are talented performers who could have been served by a creative story and screenplay. The movie is fun, though it wastes the actors' talents. Something the producers need to remember before doing RH3.",Rush Hour 2

54,stamper,The 2nd Rush,8,19 November 2001,"Some might say, hearing about Rush Hour 2: Not another sequel! / Not another cop buddy film!' and so on. But with these kinds of films, it is not so much originality at all. It is about being entertained. I mean going to this film and wanting to see something original is like going to see The Bridges of Madison County and rooting for violence, massive shootings, flying body parts and intense profanity. Either way: THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN
Almost all things being equal, there were only two things that could screw this one up (actually three). The script or the actors. The third thing I was talking about is actually something that was in the original Rush Hour as well. Chris Rock. I have seen a handful of films with him now and find him a bit annoying at times. but this time I did not feel like that at all. Either I have become immune to his overdone behaviour all the time, it has become less worse or I'm simply getting to the point in my life where I'm accepting the fact that there are people like that in life. Either way, I thought he was better than in for instance Money Talks (and maybe even the first Rush Hour). Anyway the other two things that could have seriously screwed up this film were the script and the actors, but I must say that although the film was not too original, the story held up very well and so did the actors. The reason for that is probably that the tone of the Rush Hour films has (so far) been more comedic. It is not supposed to be serious, it is supposed to be more like Die Hard, with a couple of big explosions, a lot of fighting (less shooting than in Die Hard here) and jokes. Well as in the first one the jokes were delivered well, from beginning to end, including the bloopers. As far as the film went, I must say I thought the ending was great and I also enjoyed the last two bloopers very much. This film proves that, if the jokes and the acting are good enough they even can make up for small losses in story quality and other bad things, like action film clichés. It is kind of funny that there are films in which clichés can be really disturbing and ruin almost your whole film experience. In others however (like in this one) clichés are present, though they not ruin your experience of the matter at all. I guess it is all in the approach of the material and the cast and crew involved. 
Jackie Chan (as Inspector Lee) did was he is supposed to do in this film, be funny and do a lot of fighting. There were a few difficult stunts here but not one that really made my jaw drop to the floor. I  would never say this was due to the ageing of Chan like others do, because I do not know whether that is true and second of all, I did not mind that there were a few less jaw dropping stunts'. It did in no way hurt the film.
To finish it all of, I have to give credit to Roselyn Sanchez, who did a great job on this film. I could just not figure out if she was supposed to be one of the good guys', or the bad guys'. It had nothing to do (at all) with the fact that she is very pretty. By the way, was that really a Snoopy tattoo??? I could really not tell and it wasn't because I was looking elsewhere! No, it was just, that the cinematographer did not zoom in enough. I wish he could have brought things to my attention better! Anyway, I really meant what I said about Roselyn Sanchez, both that she could act (and fight!) well and that she indeed looks very pretty. Talking about pretty (yes, AGAIN), where the hell do those filmmakers get all those pretty women? I mean if I would have been in the same situation as Carter (Chris Tucker) in the film, when he was in the massage parlour, I would have probably done the same thing. My eyes would have popped out (and probably my jaw would have dropped and my tongue would have fallen to the floor as well). DAMN. Really good of (actresses?????) people. 
To get back to the film, I would really appreciate it, if the makers could bring back Roselyn Sanchez for Rush Hour 3 if they'll ever consider making another instalment. Although I don't think they have to consider, Rush Hour 3 will definitely be happening. So, Jackie and Chris: BRING IT ON FOR RUSH HOUR 3!

55,fernandoschiavi,"Rush Hour 2 takes the action to new scenarios, but maintains the scale and shallow level of the main plot, but manages to exquisitely amuse and satisfy fans of the first film",6,17 October 2020,"With the huge success of the original film, the second part of the series was commissioned with a triple of the original budget of US $ 90 million and an income also higher than US $ 348 million. For those who liked the first Rush Hour, you know very well what to find again. Its continuation, Rush Hour 2 follows exactly the same structure, after all, why mess with something that worked so well? This second part takes the action to new scenarios, but maintains the scale and shallow level of the main plot, but manages to exquisitely amuse and satisfy fans of the first film.After the events of the first film, Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) go to Hong Kong to enjoy their well-deserved vacation. But as soon as they land, a bomb explodes at the American embassy that kills two undercover agents, who investigate the falsification of a valuable ring. Hong Kong police believe the crime was committed by Triad leader Ricky Tan (John Lone), who was a partner in Lee's father in the past and was responsible for his death. Taking the crime personally, Lee decides to participate in the investigations together with Carter, who now feels totally out of place, since he had never been to Hong Kong before and is not used to local traditions.The plot of Rush Hour 2 is not the most original - but this is a basic characteristic of the genre 'police comedy': the most important thing is to create relatively tense and potentially funny situations for heroes (in 99% of cases, two policemen who fight all the time, but who like and admire deeply) can distill their good mood and make the audience laugh. In this respect, the film works very well, since Tucker easily assumes the type of rascal and debauched policeman (whose model was established by Eddie Murphy in the 1980s), while Chan returns to embody his classic cinematic persona: the good guy kind and heart and relatively clumsy who uses his knowledge of martial arts only for defense - occasions when he will turn any element of the scene into a weapon.While in the first film, American police officer James Carter (Chris Tucker) helps Chinese detective Lee (Jackie Chan) understand Yankee customs while trying to solve a crime, in Rush Hour 2 the roles are reversed. The duo begins the film on vacation in the city of Hong Kong, where Carter is the displaced foreigner. However, not even the language barrier prevents the police from Los Angeles from chattering all the time. The scenes in which he tries to speak Chinese, although extremely predictable, are very funny. After the aforementioned attack, Carter and Lee will come across guys like Tan's deadly henchman, Hu Li (Zang Ziyi - main protagonist of The Tiger and the Dragon), his partner, magnate Steven Reign (Alan King), and the beautiful Isabella Molina (Roselyn Sanchez), a sexy Latina whose position in the power game is unknown to everyone. The story is not at all complex, but it is what you expect from a film in the franchise, in which you wait for events to unfold and have a lot of fun along the way.In addition to the previously mentioned Zang Ziyi by John Lone, who is the absolute highlight once again is the duo of protagonists. Jackie Chan, keep doing the most incredible adventures that a human being is capable of. Surprisingly, Chris Tucker is also doing his very choreographed strokes in addition to, of course, his funniest performance since Ruby Rhod, the bizarre broadcaster for The Fifth Element. The scene in which he decides to show a crowded karaoke how to sing Michael Jackson is absolutely unmissable.Brett Ratner (Red Dragon) delivers a film that maintains exactly the same characteristics as the original film and prefers to remain in comfort than to innovate in some way. This sequence works best as it plays with clichés from police films and takes on a comedy tone that doesn't take itself seriously at any time. Certainly, the great thing about the script was taking the series to new locations, thus expanding the action. The film ends up taking place all over the United States, but all of its first act ends up taking place in China, in Lee's country, and ends up cleverly inverting some jokes made in the original, because now Carter is the stranger and is stepping on unknown soil to mercer of local habits. For example, in the original film, Carter tells Lee to never play on a black man's radio. Lee is the one who tells him never to play on a Chinese radio. We also see Carter embarrassing himself for trying unsuccessfully to woo Chinese young women in the language of the girls, as well as in the scene where he seeks information on where the massage parlor is and the street trader does not understand him, offering him a chicken.
Jeff Nathanson signs a script that knows how to get a lot of laughs out of situations like the ones described above, and all this with a lot of juggling and impossible scenes, and with a humor as refined as that of the original film. Seeing what worked in the first part of the franchise, Tucker gets more prominence in the spotlight and practically makes all the jokes with extreme competence, especially in the scene where he imitates Michael Jackson in the Mafiosi karaoke, when he watches the Secret Service agent Isabella by the window receiving a package and then when she asks to see the beautiful agent's badge.Incredibly, the film does not make common mistakes when action films are successful, which is exaggerating the action in the next part. The sequences of fights are not present in huge quantities, but the choreography, juggling and agility of the fights, especially on the part of Chan obviously, again lead the spectator to delirium, with emphasis on the scene in which he faces several opponents while searching a room or when performing brilliant maneuvers while climbing a scaffold full of enemies. One of the best scenes is that in which Chan pays homage to the opening scene of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, when he is forced to look for the detonator that could explode the bomb housed inside his mouth. As always, the action is in cartoon time, without excesses, with a lot of persecution, running (even without clothes on the streets they stay, although they are careful not to show anything too much) and good humor. Meanwhile, Chris Tucker demonstrates to be a faithful disciple of the humor developed by Eddie Murphy, assuming all the ways and the tone of voice of the veteran comedian. Even though he is not as hilarious as the hero of Um Cop, he detects the viewer several times with laughter (especially in the scene where he argues with a taxi driver and on several occasions when he falls out with Lee).Although all the sequences that take place in China are excellent, see the fight scene in the massage parlor or the chase by the scaffolding, Rush Hour 2 gains momentum and grows when the action leaves for Los Angeles, a place that shows the skill Chan to circumvent blows, bullets and handcuffs. The problem is that the conflict between Lee and Carter is diluted in relation to the original film. The clash with the place is what moves the characters, who understand each other better now. This difference in personalities has already been better explored in other films, such as ""Operation France"", ""Butch Cassidy"" or even ""Red Hell"". The curious thing is that Rush Hour 2 manages to overcome his supposed problems in a masterful way. By revealing geographical strangeness and despairing of resolving the plot on American soil, the film denounces the hypocrisy of globalization, which preaches a world without borders and ethnic distinction. And it is in this universe that Jackie Chan appears, who despises geopolitics and uses his creativity to make a small police comedy good and profitable entertainment.",Rush Hour 2

Chan does his fighting schtick with all the flair of a master craftsman, while Tucker - very funny in places as the proverbial 'fish out of water' - simply gets in the way of an already flimsy narrative. Roselyn Sanchez (CHASING PAPI) and Zhang Ziyi (HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS) are eye-candy characters from opposite sides of the law (Sanchez is an unlikely undercover agent, while Zhang is a high-kicking assassin), and there's solid support from John Lone and Alan King as a couple of heavyweight villains. Mindless, juvenile and relentlessly contrived, Ratner's film emulates the style and pace of Hong Kong cinema without ever matching its sincerity and charm.

60,FlickJunkie-2,Bigger but not better,6,4 January 2002,"This is a sequel that had to live up to a difficult standard set by the original.  Consistent with the rule of blockbuster sequels, this film is inferior to the first and increased the box office substantially.Brett Rattner reprises his role as director in the sequel, but he seems to have forgotten what made the first film so good.  The first RH had fantastic chemistry between Lee (Jackie Chan) and Carter (Chris Tucker) that is all but missing in this film.  The first film took every opportunity to hit us with hilarious culture clashes between Lee and Carter that gave the film a charming comedic nature woven into the action.  This film settles for worn slapstick gags like two men trying to exit a manhole at the same time.  The characters seem go their separate ways despite being in the same film, with each actor getting a lot of screen time without the other.  Chan is much more serious and focused on delivering better action, and Tucker seems intent on being even more outrageous.  Both succeed, but in the process they lose the magical synergy of the original.  There is a clear attempt to legitimize this as a real cop story as evidenced by the replacement of writer Ross LaManna with Jeff Nathanson (Bakersfield P.D., Speed 2: Cruise Control).  The dubious plot revolves around a counterfeiting ring with numerous twists and turns that leave the viewer more than a little skeptical (the U.S. government gives a currency printing press to Iran?  Come on).  Of course, the story is just a vehicle for Chan to perform his brilliant martial artistry and Tucker to open his mouth to see what pops out.  Thus, there are numerous plot compromises that are made to accommodate that end.  Hu Li (Ziyi Zhang) has about a half dozen opportunities to kill Lee, but can't seem to figure out how to pull the trigger.  As big a threat as Lee is, it seems incongruous that she wouldn't even TRY to snuff him.  At least take a shot at the guy for credibility's sake.The acting is quirky but entertaining.  Jackie Chan is very subdued and somber rather than being his playful self.  As always, he puts on a terrific martial arts and stunt show.   Chris Tucker spends much of the film doing solo standup, some of which is hysterical, but some of which just comes off as obnoxious.  I guess when your salary goes from $3 Million to $20 Million you can afford to take some chances.  Ziyi Zhang (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) is menacing as the evil Hu Li.  She does an excellent job with the martial arts scenes, but if she is going to get much farther in American cinema, she will need to learn English the way Jackie Chan and Yun-Fat Chow did in their successful attempts to cross over.  Roselyn Sanchez gets an opportunity to strut her stuff in various states of undress, but her character really doesn't have enough heft to determine whether she can really act.This is entertaining sequel that doesn't improve the franchise.  I rated it a 6/10.  While it has funny moments, the sizzle between Chan and Tucker is noticeably absent.  It is a telling sign when the outtakes that roll with the credits contain some of the funniest moments in the film.  New Line Cinema has already committed to producing Rush Hour 3.  Let's hope that the third time rediscovers the charm.",Rush Hour 2

63,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: a good action-comedy,7,30 March 2002,"Not the best of the Jackie Chan films, but definitely worth seeing if you like action movies.Like most of Jackie's films, while there is plenty of fighting and violence, there is a certain distance from realism, so that you can enjoy the action without blood, gore, or horror elements.The comedy is also strong -- I think the chemistry is better than the original Rush Hour. As I believe one of the other reviewers said, Jackie jokes more and Chris fights more. A nice balance.While there are no blatantly racist jokes, race is a recurrent comedic theme, which usually puzzles me (aren't people supposed to ignore race in our interactions and treat each other equally with respect for whatever differences remain?), but this is just the way comedy is done by many African-American comedians. Unlike with others, Chris Tucker's self-deprecating ""tough guy"" humor ultimately defused my discomfort with this, because it is clear we are not meant to take anything he says about race too seriously; he's just smart-mouthing us.Who should see this film:-- action movie enthusiasts: a must-see-- fans of Chris Tucker or African-American comedy in general who won't mind a lot of kicking and shooting. This movie is also somewhat safe for the action enthusiast to bring along the SO-- anyone who's always been curious about martial arts flicks but has been put off by stereotypes that it has to be deathly seriousI'll give ""Rush Hour 2"" a 7 out of 10.",Rush Hour 2

Michael Jackson's ""Don't stop til' you get enough"" and the beach boy's ""California girls"" are just some of the sounds in the film.I strongly suggest you watch this film! 9/10",Rush Hour 2

Chan and Tucker have a way of keeping you glued as their combination is mouth watering, but after I was done watching this film I enjoyed seeing the errors than I did seeing the film itself.Is not that Rush Hour 2 didn't have it's funny parts, because it did, it is just that from the set go you will know that the makers are trying so hard to make something out of nothing. At the end they achieved it all, they got us to go see the movie, got us to remember the movie for some also near death experience that makes you wonder just like in Rush Hour 1 and they somehow manage to create a story regardless of how weak it looked or sounded. Brett Ratner was called back to direct this film that was done 3 years after the first, so the choice is yours, do you think he did a good job? The movie plot stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker who respectively reprise their roles as Inspector Lee and Detective Carter. Now this time our duo starts their journey in Hong Kong and then found themselves back on American soil and in Vegas where they are all rolled up together with the secret service to bring down a counterfeit scam involving the Triads.The production cost for the movie is much higher than that of Rush Hour 1 mostly due to the success of the previous film Chris Tucker demanded a 20 million salary to reprise his role, at the end the movie was worth his pay at the box office. Rush Hour 1 cost $33 million and made $244 million, while this movie cost $90 million and took home $347 million from the box office and made massive cash in the home video sale.After the huge success of this movie, the production studio called the duo back for another Rush Hour run, although it took them six years to get the crew back together again so the movie was released in 2007.As I said this movie is nowhere as good as its predecessor, a lot of work and casting went into this one, but the final result didn't show that it cost 3 times more than the first but I will still say it is a fine movie to see.www.lagsreviews.com",Rush Hour 2

It has finally become mega profitable to put TV grade material onto the big screen, where people willingly pay to be intellectually circumcised.

73,TheHonestCritic,Does this sequel deliver the same rush of action and comedy of the first movie? Check out my review to find out!,10,7 December 2020,"""Rush Hour 2"" (2001), after watching the first movie, I was very excited to check out the sequel. Sure enough, it didn't disappoint! ""Rush Hour 2"" is every bit as good as the first film. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is structured similarly to the first movie, where it's a fish out of water story, in a way. Except this time, it's the other way around. Carter, played by Chris Tucker, is the new guy in town. He is on vacation in China with Lee, played by Jackie Chan. In this case, Lee shows him around for a change. That's a classic format for a film sequel, where the two main characters switch roles in the plot. Sometimes that can be a good thing, or a bad thing. The hazard with writing sequels like that, is that the result could be the same as the first movie, just with different characters or character switches. However, ""Rush Hour 2"" gets this concept right and then some. It retains the same idea, but it adds a fresh new twist and goes in directions you might not expect, both action-wise and comedy-wise. As I watched this movie, I was excited, invested and laughing all the way through. Which is what a great action comedy should do! As for the acting, it is once again stellar from all of the actors and actresses. Jackie Chan is phenomenal as Lee, Chris Tucker is hysterical as Carter and the other acting performances from the rest of the cast are just as strong as ever. All of the sets/locations are fantastic and give this film a great atmosphere. You cannot go wrong with filming your movie in China, Los Angeles or Las Vegas! All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up to this day. Finally, the film soundtrack is outstanding and sets the tone flawlessly for the story. Lalo Schifrin is one of my top 10 movie composers and this score is nothing short of a masterpiece. ""Rush Hour 2"" is a perfect sequel that definitely retains the fun and charm of the first movie and is every bit as exceptional. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Rush Hour 2"", or the first movie for that matter, go and watch them today. When you do, be prepared to laugh like you've never laughed before!",Rush Hour 2
74,dy158,Too funny and comical!,8,19 June 2006,"Maybe being Jackie Chan with one of the best Asian celebrities who really make it big in Hollywood and really brought honours for us here in Asia, I knew I was in for a great time when I first watched this movie. Also when I was growing up, his movies were those which are at times on the television here.It was like four or five years back I saw this on an projector at the school hall of my alma mater, as part of the school's post-exam activities. Really, I almost laughed myself silly as I was watching with my other peers then. Like many of us, we grew up watching Jackie's trademark kungfu moves and his amazing stunts which often made us all in awe on the movie screen.Jackie and Chris Tucker's chemistry just clicked with each other. And watching Zhang Ziyi playing a bad girl, it was like - whoa! Watching some of the movie scenes being played out in Hong Kong somehow brought back some memories for this person who grew up watching some of those Hong Kong TV dramas (with subtitles and Mandarin dubbing) on the television here. Looking at some of those scenes, at times I wondered how really the western world will see Hong Kong. But given many knew who is Jackie (he is from Hong Kong himself actually), I knew it's a relief.The two guys are just real funny between each other. But when it's time for those kungfu moves and the stunts, it always excite me. It's always like that.Definitely really funny. Prepare to laugh in stitches.",Rush Hour 2

I can happily say that 'Rush Hour 2' isn't one of these occasions. This movie picks off where 'Rush Hour' left and this film still stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. Both still are hilarious and share that amazing chemistry. The plot behind this film is well thought off and the characters were great! The acting is fantastic, the dialogue is well written and the visual effects look great! However, the main strength lies with Tucker and Chan! ***SPOILERS***There were many hilarious scenes in this film such as when Carter confronts Ricky Tan and goes all crazy and gets both himself and Lee into a fight. The part where Carter accidentally punched Lee in the face was hilarious and the excuse he made up was hilarious! The ending to the movie is great as it clearly hints a sequel was on its way.

81,mistoppi,Excellent for a sequel - just as good as the original,8,15 September 2016,"Watching sequels is a risky business. Sometimes your love for the original gets butchered because the quality of the sequels dropped somewhere along the way - writers changed, maybe even director changed. Luckily Rush Hour 2 shares the quality with the original, and is not clearly worse. And hey, how much originality do you want from action comedies anyway? Pretty much everything that was good and right in the first one is good in the sequel. Rush Hour 2 is still hilarious and entertaining, and makes you laugh out loud. The fight scenes are as amazing as previously, and now even Carter seems to have learned something. Still, Jackie Chan's skills are far more astonishing.The only thing that makes me feel a little disappointed is how you'd expect this movie to take place entirely in Hong Kong, but no, they go back to the US. There are enough movies taking place there, couldn't we have had this one in Hong Kong? The languages are pretty and the scenery feels refreshing compared to the tired streets of Los Angeles. The chemistry between the actors is still excellent. It might be even better now that the characters know each other better and aren't just two random people thrown into a same case - but it might not be as interesting to the audience. It was more interesting to see two strangers trying to get along and work together, but this works as well.Rush Hour 2 is still a decent action comedy. It speaks about the quality when a director is the same in the sequels and in original. Usually when the director changes into someone not as good, the quality drops, sometimes as badly as in the Hostel series. But Rush Hour and at least this second sequel seems to be just as good - predictable and stereotypical, but still entertaining.",Rush Hour 2

83,HenryHextonEsq,Boring to say the least,2,18 August 2001,"I'm surprised to see this film has attracted so many IMDB plaudits, but then tastes do vary. My opinion is that this was a nondescript, terrible movie. The ""humour"" of the film raised not a smile; the level of comic acting and wit was insultingly low. Jackie Chan was not impressive, even as the straight man of the duo. Chris Tucker was truly awful; high-pitched spouting of arrogant, irritating and moronic dialogue does not a comic performance make. The ""jokes"" were unbelievably crass on the whole; though what was more shocking was the amount of laughs they drew from an audience. I didn't think that facile, lazy racist type jokes were to be tolerated anymore; but hell, if they're spouted by a ""black man"", they're alright, brother. If Tucker's ""role"" had been played the same by a white person, there would, I suspect, be outrage. The action sequences were nothing special; nowhere near up to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" for example. The least said about the dire, dull plot the better. The only positive is that the film only lasts about 85 minutes, though it certainly seemed longer. That this film has been so praised shows just how little many people have come to expect from films.Rating:- */*****",Rush Hour 2

And you have the script of, like, 95% or the movies out there.And this generic movie gets a 7.5, while truly inventive films such as Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" get lower grades? That should tell you a lot about the values of the voters on the IMDB.Lets compare this movie to an american icon: GM. These guys create a platform, and then they spawn lots of look-alikes. Example: Buick Rendezvous and Pontiac (yack!!!) Aztek. Cavalier and Sunfire. You get the idea.

All the better for a 'fast mouthed' James carter to be, more women to get attention from!! Another adventure has already started, before they even know it. Lee is on the case again, in his town, but of course, James just wants to 'Par-tay' ""I want some moo-shoe man!"" Carter quips, ""Oh you are hungry?"" Lee inquires to his friend and guest. Nope! Carter is looking for some 'action' of the female species, again. Always. They are getting literally no where until, they reach The 'States' again, and it all takes off! On the trail off a cold-blooded mafioso killer. These two are to naive to be scared, well at least one of them anyway. The pressure is on and getting hotter, they take a lead that gets them through into a semi-truck all tied up. When they figure on their demise in this situation, thanks to Lee's insight, they work had and break-free!! Along the way of breaking from it, they accidentally stumble onto a load of C-notes hidden in some artistic statues. Carter sees them and picks up a coupleexclaiming ""H E L L O -B E N J A M I N !""As they roll into Las Vegas, they do an outstanding job of following, not without being seen though. When they head into the casino, Carter gives a brilliant diversionary performance all followed by dancing like 'Michael Jackson' on the craps table, with a big cowboy hat on, yes it's like Michael Jackson...at a ho-down!! James is impressive though at the 'craps' table. He takes quite a bit out with him in the end. Well, I mean he isn't going to retire on it but he does have a lot of fun with it. Before he makes it out, the evil-dragon lady attempts to kill him she lunges at him with a sword sticking it into his chest! As he recovers he realizes, after reaching into his jacket pocket that it was the 'c'-notes in his pocket covering his heart that helped to save him from being run-through and he gleefully exclaims, "" Thankyou -Benjamin!!!"" And with out a doubt, Carter and Lee are solid again, in this comedic tale of the Red Dragon lady and samurai warriors from the hood, in Las Vegas. I love these guys! Even my little infant son would like them because both Carter and Lee exclaimed that they love 'Snoopy' too (the Tattoo on the female agent 'Isabella' that they were watching) Can't wait for '3' I recommend this 'warmer' than even the first, East meets West comedy team.

Yet after reading through a bunch of overly negative reviews for it on here could I come to the conclusion that some people don't get out much. If you walk into some mindless movie expecting reality or ""responsible violence"" (what is that!?) you need to turn in your movie viewership badge and get your head checked. I'm laughing, but I'm also serious. Who goes into a movie, particular an action movie, and expects anything substantial to come of it? It's not meant to add depth to your life or improve upon society.It's escapist fare. You can debate it's quality, but what a waste of energy it is to sit at a computer and bang out such angry diatribes for something as trivial as Rush Hour 2 as some people have done. If this is where you make your stand, call it a day. Life is much harder than this. I went into this sequel hoping for a good laugh or two and an excuse to get out for the night and that's exactly what I got. Although it's the same fish out of water scenario as the original, I thought it was done better here. Brisker pace, more funny bits. Chris Tucker's racial jokes rode a fine line between offensive and funny, but in a sequel this hyped, you know everything is going to be bigger including Tucker's loud mouthed boisterous attitude. Like it or hate it, see it or don't, Rush Hour 2 is a harmless ninety plus minutes of escape not worthy of any real deep scrutiny.",Rush Hour 2

The addition of two seductive female leads, Hu Yi and Special Agent Isabella make this a very interesting sequel. In Rush Hour 2, Carter and Lee's friendship develops.

98,smashattack,Just as good as the first!,7,3 February 2003,"I was about to write down that Rush Hour 2 is better than the original, but I decided against it for a few things.  I'll explain in a minute.Rush Hour 2 is one of those rare experiences in which it is no worse a movie than its original.  Usually a sequel is hardly worth watching, or just less of a movie.  Rush Hour 2 is an exception.The comedy is even better this time.  Inspector Lee, played by the quick martial artist Jackie Chan, gets some of James Carter's egocentricity rubbed onto him.  He attempts to act more like Carter in this one, which produces some hilarious results.  Especially in the trailer.  I'd like to explain more, but I won't give spoilers.While the first one had a very continuous plot, this one seemed a little... askew.  Bits and pieces were flung in all directions, and the characters just seemed to be wandering into all the right places on accident.  Lee and Carter meet the Triads, a ferocious gang accused of smuggling valuable dollar plates, in a night club.  The next day they accidentally find Ricky Tan, the leader of the Triads, in a massage parlor.  Later that same day, Carter happens to find some of the Triads driving off in a taxi. Considering how large Hong Kong is, it's extremely unlikely that they would stumble upon these gangsters so often.Also, in Las Vegas, they come out of a sewer grate and immediately find the casino they are searching for.  A little too perfect, I think.Still, that one little flaw doesn't do too much harm to an already excellent comedy.  Lee and Carter continually get into strange predicaments and find themselves being sucker punched again and again.  It's also quite amusing how the officials above them are always attempting to keep them off the case.I can only hope that Rush Hour 3 continues the excellent predicaments and motor mouth jokes that Lee and Carter pull off.

But in this modern version we have to constantly hear about Nelson Mandella; oppression against minorities and we even literally hear a monologue about how whites are stupid and go run and hide.  Another quote says whites are always behind every crime.  Yes this is an action comedy but at times I felt as if it was just a disguised vehicle for some of the things raved about by professors in politically correct college classes. 
Also it did not have the real action of older Jackie Chan flicks .  It can not be put in the same league as films like Enter the Dragon when cool was cool.  Bring back Bruce Lee and John Saxon.  Unfortunately Lee the legend is dead.  And what remains is silly wimpy stuff.",Rush Hour 2

At least in this case, the original is one of the best movies i have ever seen. It is still a hilarious and action-packed. And it has Roselyn Sanzhez. In the sequel, Carter and Lee are on vacation in Hong Kong when a mad bomber blows up the police station. So they must find him and bring him down. Chris Tucker is one of the funniest people to ever walk the earth. Seriously, I'd watch anything with him in it. Jackie Chan hasn't lost a step, either. He still jumps of buildings, slides under everything, and kicking people in the face in between.The writing however is where the movie fails. Some of the jokes seemed forced, and the plot is kind of a throwaway. I know the plot doesn't matter much in these kind of movies, but at least in the first one they put forth an effort. Still, these are minor complaints and i love this movie and look forward to the third installment. 7/10",Rush Hour 2
102,RJBrez,One of the best action comedies ever.,8,8 May 2021,"Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2 still stand as two of my favorite action comedies ever. Chan and Tucker have incredible chemistry. It's so disappointing that Rush Hour 3 was terrible, but if you pretend that 3 never existed, the first two are awesome. I rewatched them the other day and I still laugh as hard as I did years ago. RH2 accomplished the rare feat of being better than the original.Face it, it's 2021 and the world sucks right now. Watch these movies and enjoy yourself for a while.",Rush Hour 2
103,Streetwolf,funny and entertaining,8,17 January 2002,"Jackie's English is improving and his movies are getting better once again. Carter takes time off and heads to China to see his friend Lee, who pretends to let Carter have his fun with the ladies so he can continue investigating a bombing at a US embassy, but it doesn't take the duo long to find themselves in deep water.My favourite part of all Jackie movies are the end credits where they show all the mistakes and goofs and in this there was one that entertained me the most. So the boys are standing at the airport when suddenly Chris Tucker's cell phone starts ringing. He notifies the person who called to call him back at 7 since he was shooting the film right then, but then the person on the phone starts getting stubborn asking what he means and Chris says he is standing in front of Jackie Chan doing the movie and suddenly the person on the phone wants to talk to Jackie and when Jackie gets the phone he's like ""What are you doing? We are making a movie and you're wasting our time here!"" It was funny! Best part in the movie: Chris Tucker singing at a bar! 8 out of 10 good movie and i hope there is a 3rd in the works.",Rush Hour 2
104,Mario64,A mixed bag and overall unfulfilling,5,20 April 2002,"I was overall disappointed with this movie. It's a shame with it's great stunts, nice action sequences and funny moments, the movie gets much overshadowed by Chris Tuckor's consistantly annoying comments. In the original Rush, which is a better movie, Tuckor and Chan were interesting and funny together, and you didn't cringe in annoyance at so many moments. This Rush offers nothing new, and it really didn't have to, but it certainly didn't need to go overboard. I'm a Chan fan but this one wasn't quite there. I give it 5 out of 10.",Rush Hour 2

106,Philaura,BEST COMEDY DUO since George & Gracie,10,14 August 2001,"What fun this film is. I say ""is"" instead of ""was"" because I am in the process of seeing it again and again.  So much talent on this screen you can't absorb it all in one sitting. I've watched Chris Tucker's career bloom for a while now, and he's really come into his own. The only thing he can't seem to do really well is sit still.  Jackie Chan is incredible. What an unbelievable imagination he is blessed with and coupled with the abilities of the finest athletes.  Together the chemistry between these two just explodes.  I had nothing but a ""GOOD TIME"".  They say he who has the ability to laugh at himself will be thoroughly entertained his entire life.  Some of these critics out there need to learn to lighten up and cut loose.",Rush Hour 2
107,Mike Astill,About as fun as you can reasonably expect.,6,9 August 2001,"Following on almost directly from where the first left off, this is about as fun as you can reasonably expect, with the added bonus of Tucker being less annoying than the first time round.  Marginally, anyway. That he got paid more than Jackie for his presence is a major insult, however.The plot is enough to make you drop off to sleep instantly, and is therefore unimportant. What IS important is that it leads quickly from one comedy action setup to another, so it works just fine. Like in the first film, it's Jackie's moves that steal the show, and although he and Tucker spend much of the movie hanging from high buildings, there are more than enough quality fight scenes to keep his fans (like me) content. The film's funniest moments are in the outtakes at the ends, which certainly isn't desirable but entirely expected. The gorgeous Zhang Ziyi has a welcome role as a high-kicking villain, and hopefully we'll be seeing much more of her in the future. Probably not in Rush Hour 3 though, which will undoubtedly to be heading our way in a year or two.",Rush Hour 2
108,Batkid1,A fun sequel!,8,3 November 2007,"The first one wasn't that great of a film to begin with, but was a fast-paced, action-packed and hilarious return to the buddy-cop formula and launched forward both former music- video director Brett Ratner ( ""Money Talks,"" ""X3: The Last Stand"" ) and hardly-known comedian Chris Tucker's careers as well as give foreign martial arts/action star-singer- comedian Jackie Chan a bigger audience.Anyway, this film has more laughs then the first, has more wacky secondary characters as well as an annoying villainous played nastily by former dancer Zhang Ziyi ( from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" fame ) and even has Don Cheadle ( ""Hamburger Hill,"" ""Ocean's 11/12/13"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"" ) as a half African-American, half Chinese martial artist who is in one of the most hilarious cameos ever in the history of film ( well, in my opinion at least it's a classic! ).The plot once again moves along to where it's not non-existent nor uninteresting, but not new either. Plus, if anyone isn't intrigued at all by the hilarious premise, it's at least worth one view for the ending credits which consist of funny out-takes and stunt mishaps. Heck, I already want to see this film again just to watch all my favorite scenes!Enjoy this and other buddy action-comedies ( ""BAD BOYS,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""Tango & Cash,"" etc. ) back-to-back and you will be in movie heaven!",Rush Hour 2
109,bedazzle,"triteness, convenience, puerility",4,4 August 2001,"I knew I would hate this movie before I even watched it. All reviews so far have been in praise; a perspective from the pretentious side will follow here.Spoilers:Triteness: In the environment of America's most powerful, evil, and openly communistic enemy, two Americans are murdered - oh they'll pay for this. This Ameri-bias and ignorance is further illustrated by the horribly ridiculous explanation of the origins of the elusive printer.  But they won't pay until Carter is able to overcome his excessive need for women and party through Lee's disclosure regarding the relationship between Tan and Lee's father - now it's personal. Where do our dual protagonists go from here? To California, as Carter has somehow grasped the surrounding triteness and used it to continue on the right track. Carter uses simple logic: All trite action movies involve a behind-the-scenes ""rich white guy."" Rush Hour 2 is a trite movie. Therefore Rush Hour 2 involves a behind-the-scenes rich white guy. In the end, Lee proves to be above revenge, and only ""accidentally"" kills his arch nemesis. He thus solves the conflict with his father and demonstrates this with his gift to Carter - though it would have been better if he had just thrown it away a la Top Gun; what does Carter want with a stranger's badge? Also, the beautiful belle is attained and the door is left open for another sequel. Triteness reaches perfection.
Yet we knew from the start that the plot would contain nothing of creativity. It is the action and comedy of this action/comedy duo that is supposed to carry the movie. It does not. The action is nothing but a series of conveniences stacked upon one another Hong Kong's skyscrapers and the comedy is markedly puerile.Convenience: It's ironic that the opening panning view of Hong Kong is used to show its large skyscrapers and technological innovation, while in its first action scene a building just happens to be being made of bamboo. Basically, each action scene consists of the typical outnumbering of the heroes, the heroe's triumph, and all the while the scene is chock full of conveniently placed objects and apparatuses. I find cinematic choreography only slightly less annoying than that of a music video. I just kept thinking, ""They spent so much time on the least important aspects of a movie."" With failed action, comedy is this movie's only savoir; it failed as well.Puerility: For me, the most humorous aspect of this movie was the fact small children were laughing just as hysterically as grown adults. I myself would be embarrassed if I found myself entertaining myself with the things I had as a child. The jokes were horrendously childish. Case in point, here are a few of the great laugh getters: ""I just got a chop stick stuck up my butt,"" ""You just told them to take out their samurai swords and shave your butt,"" ""You all (Chinese people) look alike,"" and ""I'll slap you back to Africa."" I was intrigued that this racist comedy went so well over, and also that scenes in which people are kicked in the face are so laughable. There are also a plethora of scenes in which Carter attempts to speak Chinese, with hilarious consequences (his attempts fall short in what he was trying to say, but conveniently he speaks prepubescent Chinese fluently). This does not fit my taste of comedy.:SPOILERS ENDIf you've enjoyed this movie then you've enjoyed at least one aspect of my stipulated triad. There is nothing wrong with that, I just do not prefer this type of movie.",Rush Hour 2
110,tbabe29,Love the Lionel Richie joke...,7,19 August 2001,"This movie is exactly what you expect.  It's a good time. It's slow in some places (the embarassingly dramatic attempts), but overall, it's worth your buck.My favorite line comes from Chris Tucker about Lionel Richie. I couldn't breathe because I was laughing so hard. I think I chuckled for about 20 minutes after that.  That is the best line I have heard in a long time in a movie. It's so true!!And of course...THE STUNTS ARE AWESOME!! JACKIE CHAN IS THE MAN!!7/10T",Rush Hour 2
111,LeThAlWeApOn389,Funny,9,4 July 2003,This movie was absolutely funny. I laughed throughout the whole movie. Chris and Jackie make a fantastic team of comedy. This was so much better than the first. Jackie Chan was awesome with his action moves. I can't believe how incredible he really is. I didn't know that anyone could do that. Chris Tucker was laugh-out-loud funny throughout the whole movie as well. It was a great movie and I recommend it to all viewers who like comedies.,Rush Hour 2
112,Pelrad,Turning the Tables on the Critics,9,8 August 2001,"Rush Hour 2, easily the best movie of the summer, had me in such stitches that I went and saw it again the same weekend. Consensus seems to be that it is better than the original with which I heartily agree.I was disturbed in noting how the general public has been responding to this film in comparison with the critics. Everyone in the cinema was rolling with laughter and on a high after the movie ended, unanimously talking about how great it was. In contrast, half of the critics seem to be giving it great reviews and half bad ones.Let's turn the tables on the critics.It is to be expected that some will love a movie and some will hate it; but what is startling is seeing the same movie on a critic's Ten Best List for the Year show up in another critic's Ten Worst List of the Year. This was the case for several movies last year. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly regarded ""Dancer in the Dark"" as the best movie of 2000, while Time Magazine listed it as the worst movie of the year. ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" was seen by Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune as the best movie of 2000, while EW's Owen Gleiberman regarded it as the year's worst movie. Gleiberman listed ""What Lies Beneath"" in his Ten Best List of 2000, while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times listed it as one of the worst of the year. The fact is that these people can't agree on anything.It is appalling also that critics obsessed with a paralysis by analysis end up contradicting themselves. The aforementioned movie critic Roger Ebert gave as his primary reason for disliking ""Rush Hour 2"", a scene where the Chris Tucker character distracts a small army of security guards, by making a big stink about being treated unfairly because of his race, so that the Jackie Chan character can infiltrate the back rooms of a casino. Ironically, this was EXACTLY the same tactic that the Danny Glover character used in a scene in Lethal Weapon 2, a movie which Ebert gave 3.5 out of 4 stars. Go figure folks.So ignore the critics and go out and enjoy Rush Hour 2.",Rush Hour 2
113,thehardyboyz2043,"Funny, but that good of a movie.",4,22 August 2001,"""Rush Hour 2"" has more laughs and action than the first one, but whenever it the action stops, the problems show. Chan is entertaining as always, and his stunts are still something to behold. But, as Roger Ebert said, ""The problem in 'Rush Hour 2' is Chris Tucker never shuts up."" Well I do agree with this statement, Tucker is a funny guy, ""The Fifth Element,"" ""Friday"" and ""Rush Hour"" are definite proof of that, but in ""Rush Hour 2"" he's way too hyperactive, which gets just a little bit irritating after a while. The story is also nothing special, in fact it isn't very clear most of the time, and if the film were just a bit more entertaining the lack of plot might not have been such a problem. But there is one bright spot, which is in the film's casting. Zhang Ziyi (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") is a nice addition to the cast even if she's given very little to do, other than kick Chan and Tucker around in almost every scene she's in. Well I felt she was a nice addition because she's a great martial artist and I think she looks pretty good too.  Well anyway, this is an okay movie, funny, but not great. ** out of 4 stars.",Rush Hour 2
114,Rhino Rover,Yahooooo!!,10,14 August 2001,"Hahahahaaaaa! I'm stilling laughing about this movie and I've seen it two times already. Whatever you do, do not read professional film critics' reviews. I've seen a few of them now and have no idea what movie they were watching. And the criticisms they had, don't know what they were talking about. I loved this movie! I may be the only one who thinks this but I think this movie was even better than the first one.Rush Hour 2 follows on the footsteps of Rush Hour with Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) and Detective Carter (Chris Tucker) joining forces again except this time, they reverse the `fish-out-of water' scenario. Carter is in Hong Kong on vacation but all that's happened since his plane landed is that he's followed Lee on different cases. Getting a little frustrated and wanting to get some `mushu', Carter threatens to head back to the US. Lee gets a last minute call on a new case (Carter doesn't know about this) and they head off to a nightclub to Carter's delight. And off we go on a wild, hilarious ride with these two oil and water characters.What was so funny about this movie?? Everything, but a lot of it had to do with the writing and the genuine liking these two actors had for each other. You'll see it at the end of the movie with the famous Chan outtakes but even without them, you can see that they really enjoyed making this movie together. The opening 10 minutes really sets the audience up as it is nonstop laughter and you can't but help feel good for the rest of the movie.
Jackie Chan is getting older. There's no doubt about that but he's also like fine wine. The older you get, the better you get. He has always been an incredible action/stunt actor but his comedic acting is no sack of potatoes either, especially with this movie. He seems to have picked up some things from Tucker and the two just go at it nonstop. There's also no doubt that Tucker is the comedic relief but Chan holds his own. But talk about letting the horses loose here with the material that Tucker gets to work with. I have to admit, I found Tucker a bit annoying at times in Rush Hour but in this movie, his outrageous behavior fits in very well. There are obviously going to be racist jokes in this movie and they don't reserve it for one race or the other. All races are fair game and that may be what some critics don't like. But if you take this movie that seriously, then you shouldn't be watching it in the first place. The humor goes beyond the quick quips and outlandish lines. It also falls into the physical realm too as they made sure that some of the physical comedy falls inline with the character too and you definitely see evidence of this throughout, especially towards the end. Ziyi Zhang is an up and comer. You saw her in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and as her English improves you will definitely see her in more Hollywood movies. She has a bit of a Lucy Lu quality and will definitely appeal to the North American audience.The one thing that I was really glad about this movie was that they didn't show too much of it in the trailers and commercials. You got a glimpse of the humor but they didn't give it away which quite often a lot of trailers do. If you put the best stuff in the trailer, the rest of the movie kind of seems anticlimactic but they didn't do that here.On a pure entertainment level, I give this a 10/10. It's fun, fast paced, well-written, well acted and just plain entertaining. Guys, this is a GREAT date movie. Take someone, she won't be disappointed. Gals, dittoand he'll think you're pretty cool too.",Rush Hour 2

116,Dark Eye,Only slightly better from the first one,4,8 June 2002,"I'll be one of those people who thinks that the first Rush Hour was a total bore, and I gave this one a go on the premise of more action than the last - and yes, I'm a big Jackie Chan fan as well. Indeed this sequel does pick up the pace a little more, but there's not much of an improvement. Most of the problems that plagued the first one is still here. Lousy camera work reduced Jackie Chan's sheer athleticism into those pathetic Tae-Bo ""one-two"" manouvres, and that annoying motormouth named Chris Tucker is STILL annoying as hell (although he is hilariously funny in the Fifth Element). He speaks too much like a chipmunk filled with helium. Can someone just please lower his voice digitally? It would ease our ears of so much aggravation.*****SLIGHT SPOILERS*****The jokes are a bit better this time, but unfortunately most of them are aimed at Jackie and not Tucker, which is unfair. For crying out loud, this is Jackie Chan's movie, and he's the star! I'm sure the audiences want a better balanced verbal punch-up between those two. While his english is not that great, it was funny nonetheless when Jackie gets to fight back with lines like ""I'll b**** slap you back to Africa"" we need more of those lines in this movie to even out their ""clashing"" buddy-cop dynamics! Then it occured to me when Tucker were ranting about slavery and Nelson Mandela on the crap table, in reality he is a movie star who gets $20 million (or something like that) to say those words. How's that for irony? Obviously the studio is using this movie franchise to appeal to the mainstream African-Americans, as the racial jokes were too one-sided. It shows just how undignified (or unimaginative) those Hollywood guys are.Rush Hour 2 is obviously more exciting than the first, and in this movie Jackie even gets to kiss the girl. The last half of the movie gets better as well, which is good. The outtakes are also better this time, especially when Tucker kept saying ""Jackie"" not ""John"" which prompted Don Cheadle to say ""His name is Lee godd***it!"" But I miss seeing old-school Jackie Chan action, and I have a problem not seeing enough of Jackie's character fight back at Tucker's insults, or even better, tell him to shut up! Oh, those high-pitched whinings ... how I wished it was Tucker and not Jackie whose mouth was strapped with a grenade!",Rush Hour 2
117,tripper0,Tucker never fails to make me laugh.....,8,16 August 2001,"Chris Tucker, as obnoxious and loud as he may be, never ceases to make me laugh.  He was hilarious in 'Money Talks', and excellent addition to a fine movie in 'The Fifth Element' and funny in the original 'Rush Hour'.  So in 'Rush Hour 2', shock shock, he kept me laughing for almost 90 minutes. And on top of that, Jackie Chan was as entertaining as always with classic Jackie Chan choreographed fights and stunts.  The movie never gets dull as either Tucker of Chan, and most of the time both, light up the screen.  They have great chemistry together, and this film is still as fresh as the first one. Zhang Ziyi is a fine addition as the villian, and she kicks some major ass. She not only looks fine, but she holds her own as well.  The plot and story are nothing special, but functional enough to keep everything moving along to the next fight scenes and jokes.  I didn't watch this for plot however, but for some excellent fighting and some good team work between Chan and Tucker.  There are some really excellent scenes in this film, and the classic Chan blooper reel is here again, at the end of the film, and it is one of his better ones.  I hope they make a Rush Hour 3, because they are on the verge of a very entertaining trilogy.  8.5 out of 10, and the best 'summer movie' this year.",Rush Hour 2

119,Darth_Stat,Yeah it's sometimes funny but mostly just weak.,10,15 October 2001,"Crouching Tiger's main problem is that most of it's duration is the overlong fight scenes, well guess what, this one is comparable. You can pretty much forget the jumpy story of this thing, if martial arts slapstick is what your after welcome to home. It's still pretty funny, most of the outtakes are misfires though and you end up feeling sick from Tuckers constant sqealing, he is almost exactly what Jar Jar would be in a tux (played by negro Ahmed Best), he walks around squealing and waving his arms and delivering some of the dumbest one liners and generally messing up the works for Chan. The veteran of Best Picture nominee Crouching Tiger, Ziyi Zhang looks fair dinkum like a kid that knows how to fight, ill placed as a triad henchwoman. You really dont pay much attention to the story but the sporadic laughs and stunts are watchable. I still dont understand however why this thing ranks even close to movies like 'The Lost World' or 'Saving Private Ryan' and it doesn't deserve to breathe the same air as 'The Matrix' or 'Gladiator'.I have heard people putting the Mummy Returns down as worst sequel (or perhaps even movie) of the year, well guess what, it just got toppled if they need to go that far.

I watched it and thought it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I was glad that it was something fresh and new as the Lethal Weapon movies (Which I also thought were excellent!!!!!!!) had finished and i thought that it was even better than them. Then when i heard that they were making Rush Hour 2 I couldn't wait until it came out, however i was worried that it might not be as good as the first as very few sequels are these days, but i was not disappointed in the slightest. I laughed all the way through this movie and even more than the first one. Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are perfect for the roles and both are excellent throughout the movie which has even more humor than Rush Hour 1. Rush Hour 1 is still excellent but i think Rush Hour 2 has to be funnier having watched them both hundreds of times.

Jackie & Chris are a great delight to watch, they give you many laughs and great fighting scenes. A slight step up from the first instalment of Rush Hour, It's more rush and better action. But what makes this movie so great? It's just hilarious, the plot again is simple but that doesn't take away anything from this film, and no one could of promoted the film in a better way then Jackie and Chris, a great team together, and i think we will all like to see them in future movies together. It's a massive step up from all these other action comedy's, as Rush hour 2 is truly a landmark. What more could you ask for from this movie nothing, it shows all it's quality's. But Brett Ratner is the unsung hero behind all this, he doesn't get enough credit after all he supplied us with this genius movie, and managed to carry the rush on for 3 instalments.

The plot is thin but that is not why you should see this film. It's the unique fight scenes and tongue-in-cheek humor. Never having seen a Jackie Chan film before, I was impressed by his physical talent and low-key delivery. While RUSH HOUR 2 has more fist fights than any in recent memory, it is extremely low in true violence. There are several explosions, but they are downplayed. This is a comedy, after all.
You absolutely must stay for the out-takes at the end!",Rush Hour 2
126,phantopp,Tucker and Chan still have it,5,4 April 2009,"""Hong Kong Police Inspector Lee"" (Jackie Chan) and ""LAPD Detective James Carter"" (Chris Tucker) are in a much needed vacation in ""Lee's"" homeland. However, their plans change when a bomb explodes at the United States Embassy which kills two customs agents who were investigating a counterfeiting ring.Hong Kong police assign ""Lee"" to the case. It is believed that the man behind the bombing was a man who not only turned to a life of crime after a career in law enforcement, but the man who was not only the partner of ""Lee's"" father on the force, but the person directly involved in the cause of his death as well.Now, the two unlikely buddies have to join forces once again to bring those responsible to justice.Let me say right off the top, the reason to see this movie is Tucker and Chan as an on-screen duo. Their comedic timing together is nearly flawless. If you ask me, it is nearly impossible to say who is funnier when the script warrants. Both have great comedic timing when they are by themselves. But, when they are together -- priceless.One thing I noticed is that some jokes, like one-liners specific to either ""Lee"" or ""Carter"" has snuck into this move. The good thing about this is that they don't go over the top with the jokes that carry over from the previous movie. They also don't really set up these jokes in an exact copy of the original scene.Another reason to see this movie is the fight scenes, and the stunts by Chan and his stunt crew. If you've seen other Chan movies, you will already know that the movies he's in are known for their stunts and fight scenes. Chan goes for spectacular, and memorable stunts, always leaving some of the biggest for the movie climax. And Chan, as well as his stunt crew, don't fail to amaze. There are some great stunts, which, in fact, have minimal safety percautions. And the fight scenes, which are amazing to just sit back and watch, are fast paced, and wonderfully choreographed. It is hard to believe that people can move that quickly. Some of the best comedic moments between Tucker and Chan come during the fight scenes, which even Tucker gets involved with.I was not too impressed with the supporting cast. Then again, I missed a lot of the movie due to commercials from TBS On Demand, which I watched this on. From what I did see, Roselyn Sanchez, who is one of the hottest women I've seen in a movie recently, played her character nicely. I just wasn't too impressed with the performances, including hers. She could just stand there as far as I am concerned though.The story itself is pretty good, but I would suggest that you watch an unedited version. I noticed that I paid more attention to some websites I joined while watching the movies, more than the movie itself.Unlike Chan and his stunt crew, this movie doesn't take advantage of their locations. I would have liked to have seen some scenery shots to set up the scene. I don't remember any in this movie.Also, now here is a must for this film, watch through the closing credits for the outtakes. If you think Tucker and Chan are hilarious when they get things right, then you have to see when they screw things up. Easily some of the best laughs are from the outtakes.I also recommend that you watch the previous film, as ""Cutter"" and ""Lee"" are well established already when they make their first appearance in this film. It will explain their relationship better to those who have yet to see the first film in the series.I have to give this film 5 stars out of 10.",Rush Hour 2
127,snow0r,fantastic fun,8,18 April 2006,"I've seen this film a few times now and it always makes me laugh. It's a great blend of action and comedy, and Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker seem to work really well together because they act total opposites and play really well off each other.The plot's fairly basic with the standard sort of Hong Kong police story about drugs and revenge, but the two fish out of water characters (Chan in LA and Tucker in HK) just make it really enjoyable. The fight scenes are pretty cool (I really liked the one with the locker doors in the casino) and Tucker's jokes with that high pitched voice are just really funny.It's just a really fun action-comedy movie that is really enjoyable. Can't ask for more than that.",Rush Hour 2
128,schmimic,"The sequel to Rush Hour, which doesn't bring us anything new, but still gives us a fun time.",8,23 April 2005,"Starring: Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker Really, when can Hollywood go without making a sequel if the original makes at least a couple of bucks? At least they picked a good movie to make a sequel of on this one.Rush Hour 2 picks up right where the first movie left off. Li (Chan) and Carter (Tucker) are out in Hong Kong having a good time, enjoying a little vacation. Unbeknownst to Carter, Li is still working on cases right now, so when they go to clubs or massage parlors or whatever, Li is on the job. And of course, Carter's big mouth keeps getting them into trouble. Just a note, yes, he is just as annoying in this movie as he was in the first one. If he drove you batty in the first one, avoid this one like the plague.Anyway, at the beginning of the movie, the American Embassy in Hong Kong gets bombed and two Americans are killed. We all know that Uncle Sam doesn't stand for that kind of crap. Americans getting killed? Oh, somebody has to pay. So the investigation is underway right away, and the Hong Kong police get Li to jump on the case right away.Just like the first movie, the plot is really just a vehicle for Jackie Chan's flying fists of fury and Chris Tucker's big mouth. One of the more amusing and accurate lines of the movie, I found, was when one guy asks Li what he's doing hanging out with 7-11. 7-11? Because his mouth never closes.Overall, I didn't like this one as much as the first. Yeah, it's still amusing, but it's been done. It's nothing new, and it basically feels like all it's doing is revisiting familiar territory in an effort to make a few more dollars. And it should feel that way, because that's really all it is.Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (probably worth a look)",Rush Hour 2
129,taikman,Unmemorable despite Jackie Chan's charisma.,6,21 March 2002,"I'm not going to spend to long on this, as there isn't too much to say. Rush Hour 2 is one of those odd-couple buddy-cop movie, with loudmouth Chris Tucker again playing alongside Hong Kong action genius Jackie Chan. The plot involves them chasing a gang of bad guys in Hong Kong and then Las Vegas, with a bit of romance, lots of jokes and lots of action. It's quite funny, and, as always in a Jackie Chan movie, the action scenes are good, particulary to the end, but it's not as fresh as the original and sometimes seems a little forced. Stay for the traditional Jackie Chan outtakes during the credits, as they're perhaps the funniest part of the film, and show some of the pain that man puts himself through while doing his own stunts. I recommend it if you're a fan of Jackie Chan, or if you want to see something light and entertaining. RATING: 6/10",Rush Hour 2
130,TexMetal4JC,The next Crouching Tiger?,5,11 August 2001,"First of all, Rush Hour 2 is not a bad movie. There are some amazing fight scenes. Jackie Chan is a terrific actor/humorist. The humor gets funnier as the movie goes along. But.But. Does Ruch Hour 2 deserve hype that includes one poster here saying ""best movie ever!"" and others claiming that it was better than the first? Sorry. No dice.Rush Hour 2 was a good movie, but it was nowhere near what it could have been. Chris Tucker's sometimes funny/sometimes irritating mouth both adds to and gets in the way of the movie. Cut his lines in half, and you'd have an excellent comedy. But for all the funny things that go on during Rush Hour 2, there is not that one funny scene. Indeed the funniest lines and scenes are during the outtakes, which tells a lot about the overall funniness of the movie itself.But the hype surrounding it threatens it to a fate far worse than the 5 I gave it. Think ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" a decent movie with shallow plot, average acting and incredible effects. But the hype is so disproportionate to the quality of the movie, to this day I will think of CTHD as a bad movie. RH2 is threatening to become another good movie given too much hype, and thereby leaving a bad aftertaste. So anyway, before I start downgrading the movie because of ludicrous overhype: Rush Hour 2 is a funny movie, with good acting and excellent directing. But it is a movie that is better seen on VHS/DVD. Don't waste money seeing it in theatres, you'll enjoy it just as much at home. Neither should you believe the hype: This is nowhere near as good - or as funny - as say, Shrek, the true comedy classic of Summer 2K1.Rush Hour 2 is simply an average comedy with good fight scenes.5/10",Rush Hour 2
131,amahlanand,A Worthy 'Blackinese' Comedy Return,9,12 June 2012,"If Chris Tucker's James Carter gallivanting in Hong Kong doesn't sound appealing to you, surely, you didn't see 'Rush Hour'. The dynamic 'Blackinese' duo return and they do so with a bite. We now have the situation completely reversed with Carter venturing into the unknown and Lee guiding him for the majority of the film. Carter's interactions with the locals and clashes with the more calm Chinese culture compared to his audacious, egocentric personality are really the highlights yet again. As I said, a hardcore African American making his way in Hong Kong is bound to be a laugh. Yet another stellar script and consistent directing from Brett Ratner help to ensure this sequel doesn't bomb out. A little less realistic, but then again, if you are familiar with 'Rush Hour', realism isn't the first thing on the agenda as much as action work and comedy play. The script was a little less compelling this time and seemed to be driven with a lighter direction in mind although it was interesting to learn a little more of the backgrounds of our two leads. Chris Tucker's loudmouth antics just about match up to his brilliant show in the original, his dialogue is as fresh, smooth, fast and excessive as ever. Oh, and did I mention as funny? He dominates the screen once again, takes charge and gives you his typical impulsive on-screen persona. Jackie Chan reaffirms his reputation as one of the world's best film stuntmen. His stunts yet again were terrifically executed and he was well supported by 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' star, Zhang Ziyi. The 'bamboo scene' was comparable in awe-worthiness to the 'convention center' finale scene in 'Rush Hour'. Again as the more sensible and sedate Inspector Lee, his partnership with Tucker is as good as ever and the interplay once again is just plain, good fun. We also saw a shift in the love interest angle with the introduction of the seductive, sexy secret service agent, Isabella Molina played by Roselyn Sanchez. Her allegiances mysterious, she really sizzles in her role. Now that the duo finally have a beautiful woman to fight over, any guesses as to who wins? If I don't give this 5 stars, it's simply because in some respects, it's a rehash of the original, in the same way in which you would deem Lethal Weapon 1 better than Lethal Weapon 2 or Beverly Hills Cop 1 superior to its successor. If you did however enjoy the original formula, look into this. As I said, it is the same old thing in some ways, but in others, the Tucker-Chan combination still find ways to surprise and entertain. And yet again, do not miss the bloopers.P.S. Also don't miss Don Cheadle in surely one of the strangest roles you will see an African American man play. But a credit to him for it, he was outstanding.",Rush Hour 2
132,duefiori,Not THAT bad but the screenplay is an insult to intelligence,5,21 April 2002,"Well of course i knew what to expect, so i was not disappointed. This is a hack-and-run movie, stuffed full of cop movie clichee. A basically useless movie; if you like the genre (which i don't) you will just pass two hours you don't know how to fill in elsehow. But man, do they have plot holes... not even holes - we are supposed to accept (swallow, better) the oddest turns of the story without saying a word? Like, people going up and down planes without booking, changing flight at the last minute? Or wild chases up and down buildings with people having dinner and barely having a flinch? Come ON! What marginally saves the movie (i gave it 5/10) oddly enough happens after the movie ends. The final goof credits are (almost) worth the ticket alone.",Rush Hour 2
133,kmberger,"Second verse, same as the first.",6,12 January 2002,"Here's my suggestion for Rush Hour 3:  Don't even bother with a real script. Just give Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan a bunch of odd dialogue and action sequences to block out, and when they finally get them right, throw the finished product out the window and just edit together ninety minutes of outtakes and gag reels.  There you go.  Instant blockbuster.They may as well take that tactic, because when by far the best part of Rush Hour 2 is the end-of-film outtake trailer, you know you have a problem.
It's not Tucker and Chan's fault, really.  These two have proven, unlikely as it may seem, that they have two things that Hollywood producers dream about at night - charisma and drawing power.  And the fact that they have a natural chemistry between them works beautifully for the buddy picture formula.  The first movie was a gigantic surprise hit.  The second one was very successful at the box office as well - it's the Lethal Weapon of this generation.But no amount of crazed stunts by the ever-flexible Chan (diving feet-first through the narrow slot in a cash window is just insane), and no amount of hyperspeed smacktalk from Tucker saves this sequel from a completely dreadful plot and script.  The plot, as it is, serves as the thinnest of excuses to move Chan and Tucker at lightspeed through Hong Kong.  And when the well runs dry on ideas for them there (all too soon), they jet back to LA on a sea of coincidences and conveniences that boggle the mind.
Basically, the film picks up where the first leaves off, with Tucker's LAPD cop spending a vacation on Chan's home turf.  They stumble onto a case involving a smuggling ring of Triads (it's always Triads) exporting counterfeit 'superbills' to the USA.  These bills are so-called because they're perfect replicas, and can only be differentiated from the real thing by burning them.  If the flame burns black, it's real. If red, it's fake.That's quite possibly the stupidest thing to come down the pike since the old method of trying accused witches - you dunk them in the water.  If they float, they're witches. If they don't, they're innocent.  Drowned, but innocent.  So if you want to prove if a bill is counterfeit, you burn it. Oh, it was black!  That was real. Too bad.  Just a prime example of the half-baked script on display here.In a role reminiscent of Jet Li in Lethal Weapon 4 (small role of badass bad guy primed to hit the big time shortly afterwards), Zhang Ziyi has her American follow-up to Crouching Tiger as an assassin for the counterfeiters with a penchant for explosives and wild fight scenes.  She's luminous, as ever, but limited to one word of English in the whole film - something she'll have to address should she desire more mainstream Hollywood success.
All told, it's not the worst film ever made, and Tucker and Chan salvage more than their share of fun moments just by working very well together. But it's an unnecessary film, as so many sequels are, and your time is better spent watching the original again.",Rush Hour 2
134,paulmamak,"Lacked the magic from the first film, but was still enjoyable to watch.",5,5 August 2007,"This did well to live up to the previous film, but it just did not have the same edge.The overall plot was good, it really brought much more depth to Inspector Lee's character. As well as including roles from actors such as John Lone, Ziyi Zhang and a brief appearance by Don Cheadle. The film provided some fun humour and the usual outstanding choreography brought about by Jackie Chan.What let the film down was Chris Tucker, he has, without a doubt, the most annoying voice and personality on screen in Hollywood and it was clearly present in this film. Ironically Jackie Chan is much funnier than Tucker, yet Tucker is supposedly meant to be a comedian and his first language is English. The outtakes like the previous film also were a great highlight.",Rush Hour 2

Once again, we are amazed and astonished at the incredible acrobatic fighting skills of  Jackie Chan and the hilarious hijinkes of Chris Tucker. These two make an excellent duo as they go and fight the bad guys(and girls) played by John Lone and the lovely actress from Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon. It's fun and action packed! Ok, there are some things that I didn't like. I didn't like the racial slurs in the movie which Tucker and Chan throw at each other. That could have been left out and the movie did have some predictablity,but other than those things, I do highly recommend this movie.",Rush Hour 2
138,helenaduberry,A bit silly,7,22 August 2001,"Jackie Chan is something special. Approaching 50, he still pulls off stunts with relative ease. Here he gets to do them a lot, but you can't help wondering how long he can keep on going. Here, Chan and sidekick Chris Tucker, who is still annoying, by the way, go around various locations trying to track down a Chinese bomber.   This film contains a lot of slapstick comedy, and has no genuine wit, which is a shame. However it's likeable enough, with some funny moments and well staged fights to keep the pace flowing. The middle of the film slows down a bit, but it's till fun. Although it borders on the juvenile, this is a crowd pleasing comedy well anchored by Chan, who is developing a talent for comedy. A step up from the days of Rumble In The Bronx.",Rush Hour 2

Sure, I can tolerateJackie Chan movies usually because of the awe-inspiring fightingscenes but the plots tend to lag behind.  Rush Hour added adecent plot and Chris Tucker at his loud, obnoxious best.  Thiswas a recipe for a great comic action film.  Unfortunately for thesequel they decided to make a overly twisted plot and poorlywritten jokes that basically play on the last film's humor.  Mysuggestion, just watch the first one again.",Rush Hour 2
141,kenvandenbussche-2,What a great rush of action and comedy this movie turns out to be!,7,17 October 2007,"Just like before, Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker join forces in a sequel that might be even better than the first one. This movie needn't bother with introductions of the main characters anymore and thus starts off immediately. That's why there is more action to be had and far more spectacular moves by the fastest hands in Hollywood. There is also more humor and the jokes only got better from the last time. Virtually every single time Chris Tucker opens his mouth he says something that'll crack you up. Clearly, they both enjoy playing their characters and seem to come off more natural than last time.The reason why this movie still feels pretty fresh, despite being a sequel and basically doing the same routine all over again, is because the environment has changed for the greater part. Whilst the first movie occurred in Los Angeles, the second one focuses mainly on Hong Kong. Both on a comical and action level, this important change provides new perspectives. And these new perspectives are of course used to the fullest of their extent which is why this movie is so very funny.The cast of ""Rush hour 2"" has a few interesting foreign women. Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang recently became famous for her beautiful performance in the film ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and repeats a similar role over here. Roselyn Sanchez is from Puerto Rico and plays a mysterious figure in this movie seemingly switching back and forth between both sides. Last but not least there's also John Lone who plays the part of Ricky Tan. Just like before: the cast is a colorful one which undoubtedly delivers. On a more comical side note: be sure to check out American comedian Jeremy Piven who plays the small yet hilarious role of a Versace salesman.In short: This is a same-old, same-old movie doing nothing really new and repeating the same formula all over again. But, amazingly enough, it still becomes one of the funniest comedy sequels ever made!",Rush Hour 2

Chan and Tucker have great chemistry in this film. The bad guys are more believable here than in the first. Chan and Tucker provide hilarious moments. The fight in the massage parlor is THE best fight sequence I've ever seen not to mention the funniest. We gets some new characters that provide some hilarious moments.

He's supposed to be this horny heterosexual guy, but is as camp as Christmas.The plot is simplistic and unreal, you get to learn nothing about Chinese culture, the jokes are weak and the most entertaining parts are when Tucker gets punched in his stupid gob. There's a tacked on romantic/espionage sub-plot that goes nowhere. There is no emotion, you don't care what happens. The US embassy bombings seem exploitative of current events.This movie really is mass-produced guff for the morons: why is it so popular? ""Shoot him Chan for talking like that about your daddy!""

We bought this movie years ago, and on a snow day from school[kids were out for a week here] we let our oldest daughter watchboth RH 1 and RH 2 back to back for a couple of days in a row.  Wewarned our then second grader about how there is bad languageand martial arts moves in this movie that were never to besaid/repeated in public.  She swore she would never do/say suchthings.  And then she went back to school.That first day back, she completed a series of martial arts kicks onkids [mostly boys] on the playground.

And she also was put on a""diet"" of G movies until she learned her lesson completely [about ayear].  This movie was excellent.  But don't be fooled.

I prefer subtlety, and I get easily bored if my mind isn't being activated. That being said I obviously did not think this movie was particularly funny. I did laugh at the out takes because there was some spontaneous humor. Chris Tucker makes an ass out of his character by making him shrill and asinine. He follows the current trend of comics, which is to throw as much manic stuff out as you can and hope some of it sticks. (Which, now that I think of it, is what Jerry Lewis did, and after I turned 18 I stopped laughing at him.) He's on speed all the way and not much of what comes out is sharp.

158,desol-2,"Top Stuff with Zhang, Chan and Tucker",9,3 August 2001,"If you didn't like Rush Hour then you probably won't like Rush Hour 2 but if like me you did like Rush Hour you'll probably love RH 2.  It's bigger, funnier more action packed and it's got the brilliant Zhang Ziyi as the extremely beautiful, mean Triad bomber.  Sure some people will moan that the plot is just an excuse for more funny or action sequences and that there's no character development.  But so what I'd rather watch RH 2 over the slightly overrated American Beauty'.  All RH 2 attempts to do is entertain for 90mins and that it does in spades so for me RH 2 slots in next to Con Air as the best of the action/Comedy's.  Zhang Ziyi is great as the nutter Triad bomber as is John Lone as the Triad Boss (where has he been).  But of Course this film belongs to Chan and Tucker who are both on top form.  My favourite moment is when Chan has the bomb in his mouth as he struggles with Zhang Ziyi.  9/10",Rush Hour 2
159,peeweehoglie,Funny,10,3 August 2001,I just saw this movie just today with my mom and we both laughed and we both enjoyed it. The outtakes at the end were very funny and we both laughed out loud. I would like to go see it again with my nephew the next time because he has seen the first Rush Hour and we like to go see this one. VERY FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!10 out of 10,Rush Hour 2
160,firedude440,Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are ten times funnier in this hilarious ride that won't stop you from laughing. (Plus the inside scoop on Rush Hour 3),8,15 August 2001,***SPOILERS*** This movie is funny. Chris and Jackie are way better in this one than the second one. The laughs start from the very beginning when Lee (Jackie Chan)and Carter (Chris Rock)are in the bar. Then intense action begins right away and you are introduced to China's most dangerous gang led by Ricky Tan. With a series of mishaps (including Lee thinking Carter is dead) they end up in Las Vegas for the last half hour. Between them being between just about them leaving Hong Kong and about five minutes when they were in Las Vegas you get some of the story and its plot so the comedy holts for about fifteen minutes. But when they go to a clothing store in Las Vegas they meet a very unique and different man that makes you laugh really hard then in the worlds biggest casino known as 'Red Dragon' Lee and Carter face a number of hilarious and awesome obsticles there is a big showdown that you won't be disapointed in. Then there is the out takes which are almost even funnier than the movie its self. Well Jackie nails his croch on thick bamboo stick and Chris can't remember a name of this food on a plane.The three funniest ones though were the one with (allright I'll tell you) the gay guy in the clothes store and he is absolutely hilarious in his own gay style. Everything about him was perfect. He was the perfect gay guy to do this role. His voice was gay. His movements were gay. He even said that he wanted Jackie Chan to go with him home. It was just great. Then the second was at the end when Jackie and Chris were talking Chris got a phone call (you don't know who. Probably a relative of some sort.) And the person wanted to talk to Jackie. He He. It's even funnier than it sounds. Then the third memoriable quote from the out takes was when a guy got pushed out of a window by Jackie and lands on a cab and is dead Chris says ' He's definantly not going to be in Rush Hour 3. And there is going to be 1 I saw an interview with Jackie Chan and he confirmed that a third Rush was in the works. Well I give movie an 8 cuz I liked every minute of it. It has good comedy and you shouldn't be disappointed.,Rush Hour 2

The story is better and the movie has more funny scenes. Especially the opening scene where Chris Tucker does an amazing Michael Jackson imitation is brilliant. The supporting roles are also better this time with Zhang Ziyi and John Lone. This film focuses more on comedy and less on action, but this movie still has a couple of good action sequences.

All that crap was not needed. It would have been a great movie without all that crap so why put it in there? There was JackieChan and that should have made the movie great in it's self but oh no we have to put sexuality and swearing in it and it's rated PG-13! I can handle swearing but using God's name in vain? no. I cannot abide that. For all you out there who hate this kind of stuff too, don't watch this movie. It's sad that Jackie Chan movies always have bad stuff in it. it's very sad. Because I love Jackie Chan. It's very sad. For the action and stuff I give it a 6.",Rush Hour 2
164,chainsmoker,Dead elephant,1,15 March 2002,"The most telling scene in RH2 comes during the outtakes that have become the most enjoyable part of Jackie Chan's Hollywood outings. Chris Tucker, the poor man's Eddie Murphy, who now pockets more than the real thing per picture, and Chan have just pushed one of the film's myriad baddies out of a window. The villain, or his dummy double to be exact, crashes into a taxicab below, shattering glass and splintering metal. Tucker glares down at the wreckage, turns to Chan and says, ""He ain't gonna be in Rush Hour 3."" Chan laughs (all the way to the bank) but it's a chuckle shot through with cynicism; RH2 is less a movie than it is a half-baked remake, just one more installment in what's sure to be an ongoing franchise bereft of novelty, invention or spirit. Chan, no stranger to sequels (the Police Story series) or moneymakers (the animated Jackie Chan Adventures) will have the last laugh but when do we get ours? RH2 provides only a few, most involving Tucker's inability to say ""gefilte fish"" during, again, the outtakes. Too bad we must wade through the tripe to retrieve such fool's gold.It's of little surprise that press notes for RH2 begin by mentioning how much its 1998 precursor pocketed in revenue: some $250 million worldwide. The current incarnation has no reason to exist other than to pick the pockets of those who found Rush Hour vaguely amusing; it does little more than rehash culture and kung-fu clashes, interrupting both with a mystery without a question mark, except maybe ""who cares?""**********WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD*************Once more, Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) and LAPD James Carter (Tucker) pair up to square off against a bad guy who exists only as plot point and prop. This time, the role belongs to John Lone as Ricky Tan, the head of the Triad and, just five years back, Lee's father's cop partner. Alan King also shows up as a greedy real estate developer, which makes me wonder if RH2 wasn't written during a nosh at the Friars Club. And the setting is a little changed. The movie kicks off in Hong Kong (three days or so after the ending of the first film), then moves quickly to L.A. and Las Vegas. It ends at the airport, with Chan and Tucker bound for New York. For $100, quick - guess where Rush Hour 3's gonna take place.Lone, once so striking and elegant (David Cronenberg's M. Butterfly and Bertolucci's The Last Emperor), is given little more to do than preen and posture as a man smuggling counterfeit money out of Hong Kong and into Los Angeles. Yet whenever he's onscreen, he seems dreadfully out of place - a Prada suit hanging on a rack of last year's GAP wear. So is Don Cheadle in an unbilled cameo as one of Carter's old informants, a Crenshaw brutha running a Chinese soul food restaurant. Cheadle looks as though he could crush Tucker with one squint; he looks less than amused to be slumming in his outtake, in which Tucker keeps calling Chan by his real name. ""His name is Lee!"" Cheadle reminds the squeaky-voiced Tucker, this time without the dismissive chuckle.But no one is more wasted than Zhang Ziyi: the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon co-star plays Tan's sidekick, Hu Li, yet she's asked to do little more than kick Tucker in the head a few times, slice an apple with a nasty-looking knife and slink around in black leather until her inevitable dispatching. In a film with little time for character development or sense-making, she has no more dignity than a poor extra trying to get her SAG card - a few lines of dialogue and nothing more. It's as if director Brett Ratner told her only, ""Stand there and look pretty."" That's what happens when you go from working with a visionary to biding your time with a hack: You stop acting and hope only you're not too terribly embarrassed by the final product.During these dog days of Hollywood cinema studio movies have become so dumbed-down they appear to have been written and shot on the bus ride to elementary school. The fans of the first Rush Hour film will wonder if it's as amusing as its predecessor. But it's only a slight diversion. The answer is no. It's never clever or smart, nor it is terribly thrilling or engaging during its numerous fight sequences, all of which are choreographed with pedestrian flair by Ratner, who helmed Rush Hour and last year's gutless It's a Wonderful Life rip-off, the Family Man. An early scene, which takes place on a scaffold made of bamboo, is so poorly shot (most of it in close-up), it's hard to tell who's doing what to whom. Jackie Chan could be kicking his own ass for all we know. Another fight takes place in a massage parlor that looks more like a converted basement game room; it's less a punch than a slap that misses.Ratner and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (responsible for bits and pieces of Coyote Ugly, Speed 2 and Twister, which should violate some three-strikes-and-you're-out law) seem to think that getting a funnyman deliver straight lines (they couldn't be jokes, could they?) warrants a hefty paycheck. In truth, all it does is demand that Tucker, who's already as subtle as a nail gun in the eye, turns up the volume to 11. Do earplugs come with that popcorn? Tucker spends damned near the entirety of the movie yelling, screaming and screeching at Chan and the audience. And still, he's making jokes about Chan's nationality and the way he talks, as though the two aren't even friends and Rush Hour never happened. If only.",Rush Hour 2
165,rogapol,See the movie at least twice,10,3 September 2012,"Carter (Tucker) is back as the ultra manic cop from L.A. and once again is the perfect mismatch for the conservative Lee (Chan) as they bumble their way through police investigations this time in Hong Kong. Zhang Ziyi is at her nasty best with one of the finest angry faces on the screen, she alone is worth the price of admission. The movie is fast paced with a simple plot and lots of trademark characteristics from Tucker as expected.This is one of those movies that you probably need to watch at least twice to appreciate the funny side of. I have to say I did watch it many years ago at never even thought of watching it again. However, now I quote lines out of it along with my other family members and that dosen't start happening until you've watched a movies at least a half a dozen times, as we have.Highly recommended for those who are fans of Tucker, Chan, Zhang and can enjoy a movie without having to check for all the technical errors.",Rush Hour 2

Touches of humour but didn't seem to be as much as in the original. A lot of it revolved round the goofy stupid American. I realise this was a deliberate feature of the formula but did he really have to be QUITE so goofy and stupid?? It passed the time, but no more than that. During out takes at the end, Goofy American is seen saying something like, ""Well he's not going to be in Rush Hour 3"". ANOTHER sequel?? Enough already. Two films on one formula is enough. No more.

168,TheHig,Fantastic,9,28 February 2004,"Forget everything you know.  Forget the well paced emotional dramas, the big budget action epics, the humourous animated extravaganzas.  Rush Hour 2, and I'm going out on a limb here, is one of the best films of the new decade.Laugh as you may, but Rush Hour 2 has just about everything a good movie should offer.  Jackie Chan doing impossibly clever fights.  Chris Tucker doing surprisingly good jokes.  Big stunts.  Funny fights.  Everything that is requisite to an enjoyable film.Jackie Chan has not been a huge success in his American film career.  Up until the first Rush Hour he'd made only several poor dubbed actioners, that could have easily been brought over from Hong Kong.  It wasn't until the first Rush Hour film that Jackie gave us something to admire, namely a good comic pairing with an actor one would expect to be incredibly annoying, and some of his usual innovative fights.  It was one of the better buddy cop films of the time, a theme he repeated with slightly less success in the decent Shanghai Noon.But it's Rush Hour 2 that really has unleashed his full potential.  Able to do comedy on the same level as Tucker, but wisely sticking to his own strengths, Jackie provides plenty of punch for his fee.Consistently funny and action packed, Rush Hour 2 is the best film of 2001, and you can quote me on that.Although I can't quite bring myself to give it a ten.My Rating: 9 out of 10",Rush Hour 2
169,R1OT,More of the same ... and that's a good thing. :),8,3 August 2001,"Just returned from ""Rush Hour 2""I went into it expecting a cheezy movie with non-original lines, second-rate acting, some kickass Jackie Chan moves, and a bunch of stupid Chris Tucker jokes (these are the reasons I liked the original..heh).The story/plot was nice and thin (just like I expected...but it doesn't really matter; no one was there to see a Drama unfold) with a silly story just like the original. It was, however, much funnier and there was a ton more fighting than ""Rush Hour"". I enjoyed this. Usually, when films try to cash in on the lines that made an original funny by repeating them in sequels, it tends to disappoint, but in the context of a ""buddy cop"" movie, you need to expect this since you assume they spend more time together than just the original 2 hours, and jokes and lines will rub off on each other. It works well.Chris Tucker is his usual crazy self; perfect timing is something he has a gift for. I don't think any other actor could pull off the stuff he does (and seeing as he was paid $20 Million for this one as compared to $2 Million for the original, you should expect him to be perfect).Jackie Chan was much better in this one. He has a lot more lines and he has the chance to ""cut it up"" with Tucker a lot more. His fighting style in this film will knock your socks off. Although it DOES appear scripted in a few parts, watching Chan move is like watching a trapeze act at a circus; it's very fun to watch.If you liked the original, ""Rush Hour 2"" will give you more of what you like. Go see this movie because it's funny, it's action-packed, and it's a nice way to spend a hot, summer day. No Acadamy Awards here, but you don't expect that from this duo. What you DO expect is a lot of fun, and that's just what you get.8/10",Rush Hour 2
170,gbalfour,I would have preferred rush hour traffic to this film,4,23 February 2002,"My Momma once told me that if I could not say something nice about someone, don't say anything at all.  That means that the section containing comments about Chris Tucker would be void of words.But, I never listened to Momma.  In the first ""Rush Hour"" Tucker's loud, obnoxious, bigoted, (did I mention loud?) character gets by because there is enough of a story line to carry the movie.  It seems that Director Brett Ratner thought this was what people wanted more of, and so they let Tucker be louder and more obnoxious and more bigoted and he stuck out like a turd on a birthday cake.  There were times you wanted the bad guys to win, just to be rid of him in the movie.Chris Tucker is not Eddie Murphy.  He never will be and should stop trying to be.  Jackie Chan is the only redeeming quality in this movie.  The has an innocent way of letting the humor of his character flow out with a subtlety and likeability.  Unlike Tucker who is like a comedian who tells a joke and then explains the punch line because he assumes the audience is to stupid to understand his joke.The movie has some entertaining moments, but they are few and far between.

I was pleasantly surprised, though, to find that Rush Hour 2 was not only funny (thanks to an odd kind of chemistry between Chan and Tucker) but also a pretty good movie. The buddy-cop movie has been done a million times but thanks to Jackie Chan's awesome acrobatics and Chris Tucker's, well...

173,Tyson1,'Rush Hour 2' is a horrible film.,1,29 August 2001,"How it made so much money is beyond me.  Absolutely no good dialogue to speak of here.  The plot is incredibly light the whole way through.  There is not one good scene, but a few nice stunts.  Chris Tucker only tries to make a dull, stupid, empty screenplay seem heavy and complete with his constant talking about nothin', but without victory.  This film does not leave a single cliché unturned.  The plot has been used in countless films. Ratner does not try anything new here, but he relies on the, supposed to be, flawlessness of the two leads.  The direction is so unbelievably by-the-book and uninspired I was dying for some neat music, interesting shots, or even just some cool voice-overs When it's funny it's insipid, when it's suspenseful it's boringetc.  This is one of the very worst films of the year, and it's too bad because the two leads are talented comedians (just not in this film).

Since Chris first caught my attention in the Bruce Willis vehicle, Fifth Element. He has proved himself to be a real comedy - action star.

175,RyeOfTheDead,Rush to see this,6,4 August 2001,"Why does hollywood feel the need to make a sequel to every movie these days? It seems like for every movie that makes a little bit of money, a sequel is inevitable.  What convinces them to do this?  I think it must have to do with sequels like Rush Hour 2, which match, and maybe even surpass the original. Rush Hour wasn't shakespeare.  It wasn't an Orson Wells epic.  It wasn't a Stanley Kubrick art piece.  It was a summer-buddy-kung fu-police-comedy. And in that regard, it was excellent.  Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker made an excellent pair, and the audience was wowed by Jackie's famous fighting, and they laughed at the humor of Tucker, as well as Chan's. And THAT is what the fans of the first movie were looking for in the sequel. And THAT is what it gives us.  Chris Tucker doesn't go through any major character development.  Jackie Chan doesn't come to terms with his place in the universe.  Tucker runs his mouth and Chan kicks some a**.  The jokes are funnier than the first movie, and the action sequences are more elaborate. So, if the comedy aspect is funnier, and the action aspect is more intense, what more can you ask for?Oh yeah, babes.  The first Rush Hour was lacking in females,  we had the kidnapped daughter, and we had Tucker's friend.  In Rush Hour 2, we have Zhang Ziyi, as a femme fatale that quiet frankly, cannot have enough time on screen. (I would like to add that I liked her better in Rush Hour 2 than I did in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Also heating up the screen is Puerto Rican beauty-queen Roselyn Sanchez, as a undercover agent with questionable motives.  To finish off my review, I will say that if you liked the first Rush Hour, you will like Rush Hour 2. If you are the sort of pretentious lot that can't fathom going to the multiplex, and just denies that movies created for our entertainment are still good movies, then why not just sit home and rent Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and keep a few more seats empty for those who WANT to see Rush Hour 2.",Rush Hour 2
176,itsclear,Rush Hour 2 is pure lighthEARted fun.,9,6 August 2001,"The plot, while not so deep and meaningful, is pretty good relative to other movies where you'd go in expecting poor plot. The comedy feeds off the chemistry of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. And the action, while doesn't surpass the original, Shanghai Noon, nor does it even come close to previous great Jackie movies, is still fun to watch.The movie begins just days after the first Rush Hour ends and from the first movie, we already know that the two detectives, Inspecter Lee (Chan) and Detective James Carter (Tucker) share a bond and there's no need to jump into character development. We know them and we smiled to see them together again singin' the beach boys down the streets of Hong Kong. There is some character development as the story progressing involving more off the fact that both parents of our two heroes were ""legendary"" police officers themeselves. But again, what's there to really know about the plot... it's a reasonable enough plot involving fake printed money and takes them from Hong Kong, to LA, and ultimately, of course, to Vegas within the span of 120 minutes.To help with the action, the movie casted Zhang Ziyi. I was hoping perhaps for a Chan and Ziyi fight scene, but was let down to see instead a floppy Tucker and Ziyi, with an horrible ending. However, she's impressive in the role as a villian and had no trouble with her lines which were all in chinese. John Lone plays our main villian man behind the whole fake money printing deal and is also the leader of the Chinese gang, the Triads. He is also Lee's father's partner and had something to do with Lee's father's death. And undercover U.S. secret service agent Isabella Molina, is played by relatively new comer Roselyn Sanchez. Male audience in attendence to last night's sold out show liked her a lot. Chan is wonderful carryin' the action in the movie. It's not his greatest nor is it even close as stated EARlier, but it's still fun to watch. He complained he had little time to do things the way he wanted it, a mistake on hollywood's rush to get it in theaters ASAP. Previous Jackie films leave you gasping and thinkin' ""AWESOME!"", this time we're just left thinkin' ""pretty cool.""What we really depend on for this movie to work is the comedy from the chemistry of Chan and Tucker. They have so little in common, yet they mesh so well. It's important to note that when you have a Chinese Guy who doesn't impress with his English, and a African-American who talks and talks... you're going to run into a lot of racial ""jokes."" A majority of them from Tucker about Asians, but I didn't really find them offensive. There are a few about white people, and Roger Ebert seemed a bit offended. But I found them to be very much light and unintentially harmful... and for the most part they aren't harmful at all. Try not to be serious about them, and you'll end up enjoyin' the movie. Aside from the racial jokes, a lot of the other comedy material were priceless: Chan trying to talk like Tucker, Tucker's Karoakin' Michael Jackson's ""Don't stop till you get enough,"" Tucker's endless persuit for ""Mushu,"" and Chan's great ability for physical comedy which should be more, but is less appreciated that any of the verbal comedy. But with all that material, plus the sure box-office success, Rush Hour 3 and 4 are inevitable.And for me, I didn't really want it to end. The movie is fun... it felt like we were the tourist and while others might complain about being in traffic, I didn't mind the rush hour with Chan and Tucker at the wheel.9 outta 10",Rush Hour 2

Don't get me wrong, there are few people who could do what he does, but I think we are getting spoiled. We expect more from him as time goes on, I guess.

Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan deserved ever penny they made because they earned it. And I really liked the casting of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Star Zhang Ziyi.

188,Counter-Strike,Not one of Jackie Chan's better movies,6,26 August 2001,"I'm a long-time fan of Jackie Chan, a real action star who does his own stunts. Unfortunately, he sinks in Rush Hour 2 mostly because the stunts in the movie pales in comparison to those he has done in his Asian movies. And that is the general problem of any of the Hollywood movies that he has done or will be doing.  In Hong Kong, Jackie is allowed to express himself more openly, which results in more daring and dangerous stunts.  In Hollywood, he is more inhibited because executives want their stars protected...safety first, no dangerous stunts, especially when you're doing it yourself.  A 3 out of 5 rating purely because the genuine chemistry between Jackie and Chris Tucker makes the movie watchable, as reflected in the out-takes.  A special mention must be given to Roselyn Sanchez who sizzles as Isabella. A much better actress in this movie than Zhang Ziyi who seems to have a permanent scowl on her face for the entire show.",Rush Hour 2

Jackie Chan has some of his most amazing stunts in this film.  Jackie and Chris together again make for a memorable reunion to continue the chemistry they had from the first film.  In fact, they seem to work together a lot better in this second film.  The plot, comedy, action, drama, and the women really make this a special film.  Buy it.

Maybe it's my hatred for ""buddy comedies"" (like that one with Owen Wilson and Mr. Chan-- ""A Not Funny Take on the West""...), but this movie sucks ballsacks. I first noticed this when Chris Tucker spoke, then the plot began to unfurl, yet Chris Tucker kept speaking. The crappy jokes didn't help it along, either. Usually, when you mix action and comedy, you come out with a quivering, inbred form of entertainment. I think you'll see what I mean when Taxi comes out. I know, it's harsh but it's true.

Chris Tucker is the most annoying screen presence since, well, Chris Tucker in the original RUSH HOUR.  Constantly hurling racial insults in a loud, high-pitched manner is not my idea of funny.  Jackie Chan is a good actor in search of a good script.  RUSH HOUR 2's plot, of course, is more of the same, a lame excuse to showcase Chan's stunts and Tucker's verbal assaults. Why Zhang Ziyi chose this vehicle as her follow-up to CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is beyond me.  The audience I was with laughed every time Tucker opened his big mouth.

Legendary Jackie Chan and motormouth Chris Tucker deliver, more effectively than the first. Jackie Chan uses some of his old tricks and some new, to make this a enjoyable film.The film takes place in Hong Kong (a beautiful part of China).  This is where Chan and Tucker leave off from the first film.  THe scenary was great, and gags including Tucker's lack of Cantonese (dialect of Chinese spoken in southern China) skills was just down right hilarious.  Great stuff.It's great how Chan has been able to share Hong Kong culture and martial arts to the American audience.Probably one of the best films released in the US of 2001.10/10",Rush Hour 2
194,Numero Uno,Highly Enjoyable,8,29 September 2001,"There was a lot of pre-release hype surrounding this movie.  Before I saw it I was anticipating that it may not live up to its expectations.  As it turned out I was wrong.  Rush Hour 2 is in fact very funny and works very well.In many ways Rush Hour 2 is better than its predecessor.  Unlike the first, this movie gets right into it from the beginning.  One of the things I found disappointing about the first Rush Hour was that it took a while before Chan actually started talking to Tucker and get the ball rolling.  The director, Ratner, obviously learnt from the mistakes of the first Rush Hour.Rush Hour 2 is very funny - the whole way through - which is quite an accomplishment.  It is fair to say though, that most of the laughs come from Tucker.  The action scenes are not too bad.  The scaffolding sequence is pretty entertaining.  It is clear that the movie focuses more on comedy than action, which is not necessarily a bad thing.On the other hand, there is a bit of recycling of the jokes and to a certain extent the plot as well.  In fact, the plot itself is nothing to call home about.I was disappointed at one stage with the special effects.  The end truck sequence - where it is blatantly obvious that Chan and Tucker are sitting in front of a blue screen for super-imposed images.  For a big budget movie I would not have expected that.I read that many people liked the acting of Ziyi Zhang from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  To tell you the truth she did not impress me.  Perhaps its because I despised the Crouching Tiger movie like the plague or perhaps its because of her impossible name or the fact that she can't speak a word of English.  Yet at 21 she still has a lot of opportunity ahead.  Enough about her though.This movie was really great and I have decided that I am going to buy the video when it comes out.  This was one of the few films I have seen where the cinema audience erupted in applause at the end.  Go out and watch it, if you enjoyed the first you will enjoy this even more - trust me. 8/10",Rush Hour 2

I'd reccomend a lot of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker movies to you, but this is currently the best, at least until Rush Hour 3 or Shanghai Knights come out. The charisma between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker is again amazing. Jackie Chan uses his keen Martial Arts and Foreign comedy to make his part action packed and comedic, although Mr. Chan gets a lot of the good jokes, the comedy still belongs to Chris Tucker. It just cracks me up to hear Chris Tucker funny high voice and fast mouth, and Jackie Chan's unclearness with words in this movie. They combine a lot of the old jokes from the fist rush into this movie that make it even more catching. I think that critics just don't like to laugh, because I have rarely heard a good review from critics who see comedies, or other movies that I seem to enjoy (Lord of the Rings, Count of Monte Cristo, Legend of Bagger Vance). I just hope that people can join me in saying this is a very good film.",Rush Hour 2

I'd read that Chris Tucker's nonstop glib insults were far more tiresome than in the original ""Rush Hour"", and in fact had crossed over the thin line between comedy and tragedy.  But the pleasant chemistry between he and Jackie Chan was still there, and the dialogue wasn't the disaster that I'd been led to expect by the ""wise"" movie critics. Sure, the plot had gaping holes, and some of the comedy seemed a bit forced, but hey, this is a Jackie Chan movie, not an art film, and I had a great time.

Jackie Chan's acting  was good but I think  he was a sideshow for his American colleague; I appreciate the fact that the director  has wanted Zhang ZiYi to be  the real protagonist and not only a guest star in this movie. Although I agree with those who say that it was unfair to make her play the role of the villainess, as it happened to Jet Li in Lethal Weapon IV; anyway she's still so young and she has got many chances to be the good girl the so-called Mrs. Nice girl (just to quote one of Jackie Chan's movies, Mr. Nice Guy) Now let's talk about Chris Rock . Is he better than Eddie Murphy ? In my opinion he must still learn a lot from his laughing ""sensei"" Eddie (just to quote martial arts) Roselyn Sanchez' s really a very beautiful actress, but she acted poorly, even though she uttered more words than Zhang Ziyi And it's perhaps  Zhang Ziyi herself  the one who makes  the whole movie worth to be seen more times.Her sexy and lethal  looks hurt more than her venomous kicks",Rush Hour 2

There were a few relatively slow moments that seemed a little wasted other than as pure exposition, but everything else was superb. The fight scenes are good...nothing to compare with some of Chan's crazier battles, certainly, but still inventive.  Tucker's mouth is as hyperactive as ever (the karaoke bar bit is a riot...as are his attempts at speaking Chinese.)The ladies of the film are not exactly the type that make you want to look away either...Ziyi Zhang looks great and plays a wonderful psychotic (even though she doesn't speak English) and Roselyn Sanchez is, despite a relatively small and only semi-defined role, quite...impressive in her own right.

It was a nice twist that it was set in Hong Kong with Tucker being the one 'out of place' however I was dissapointed that the action was moved back to the U.S.A for the finale'. Overall, it is an excellent sequel if you take it for what it is - a Hollywood buddy/cop comedy, with some slap-stick martial arts elements thrown in.

Now being an adult they're not my cup of tea anymore, but this was a funny movie. Both Chan and Tucker were acting better than in the first one in my opinion and overall it was a nice and entertaining movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon. I liked the plot and it had enough twists to keep you interested. Ziyi Zhang is also there and she's a very beautiful actress to watch and she is a plus in the movie.

If anyone can get a laugh or a kick out of this load of garbage they must not have seen any movie for the last 20 years or so. Every scene in this movie is so predictable. You just know that now there is going to be a joke about black people, now one about Asian people, now one about gay people and now this pole, which our 2 ""heroes"" hang on to, is going to break, so they will both fall down!!! Who wrote this junk. A five-year old child could have written a more interesting story. I totally lost interest in the plot of the movie at a very early occasion and almost fell asleep midtime, but I doubt that I have missed something at all.The only part of the movie which is remotely funny, is the ending where you get to see some of the mistakes made during the making of the movie. The best part is a scene (also shown on Letterman some time ago) whereChris Tucker's cell phone rings during a filming session. Jackie C is amazed how a professional actor like Tucker has not learned to turn off his gear while working. Tucker has probably just realized that this movie is not worth spending any serious time on, so he has not even bothered turning off his phone.Take my advice and save your money for anything else than this.",Rush Hour 2

While the plot is as much as one might expect, the explosiveness of Chan's fighting sequences and the uncanny and sheer quickness of Tucker's humor does this same formula right once again.I entered the theater expecting one thing...to laugh.  And to that, I and 350 others in this theater did too.  The audience in the theater I was in loved the movie so much that there was a standing ovation, clapping, and cheering at the end of the film.While some may say Chan is getting too old and while others may say Tucker's ""motor mouth"" is getting a bit too much, I say, if you enjoyed Rush Hour I and the combination of Chan and Tucker, go see this movie at all costs.

Tucker is still the loudest mouth in the west as he constantly blurts out hilarious jokes in his unique high-pitched voice, and Chan as ever is still the fastest hands in the east and has some astounding fight sequences. This movie is so much better than the first because of the mix of behaviour, in the first film it would be Chan does the fighting, Tucker does the jokes. However this time Chan has his fair share of jokes and Tucker has some cool fights which combine to form a creative duo. There are also nice references to the first film such as when Jackie tells Tucker to ""Never touch a Chinese mans radio"".

Some parts were so funny and the angle that it was shot made me laugh like crazy. One part of the movie that I always like the best was the last part of the mo vie where the mistakes that they have made were shown.

Most of us are just there to have a good time and some laughs and not to psychoanalyze the film. When I heard several of my friends saying how great it was, I was determined to go see it.  It did not disappoint in the least bit.  I laughed just as much as the original if not more.  Tucker and Chan still have a great on-screen chemistry and it shows.  I think they could've spent a bit more time in Hong Kong because it would have made for more interesting scenery than the typical LA backdrop, but it's a small gripe.  Truthfully, with the fast paced action and antics, it could have taken place anywhere and been just as great.

The viewers that give something like this fluff 10/10 crack me up.  Even 7 or 8/10 is reaching!  Are American audiences that dumbed-down where this tired plot filled riddled with holes rates as high as such classics as ""Star Wars,"" ""The Maltese Falcon,"" and ""The Godfather""?! Maybe it isn't fair to compare ""Rush Hour 2"" to those films.  Ok, Compare it to ANY ""Die Hard"" film, and it comes up short.  I think ""Lethal Weapon 4"" may have even been better.  Chris Tucker... what can I say about him that hasn't been said before.  He's a poor man's Chris Rock (who himself is a poor man's Eddie Murphy).  The man's voice is grating and his humor (if you can call it that) is non-existent.  Oh- I found something I liked: he's good at pratfalls and physical comedy (he can take a punch and fall down nicely).  I cannot take the credit for this quote (it comes from the reviewer of the San Francisco Examiner), but it sums up Chris Tucker to a tee: he is the ""human Jar-Jar Binks"".  Too true.I wish American studios would let Jackie Chan do more on his own, rather than strapping him to such deadweight like the wailing Tucker.

217,zigmund,Supporting cast steals the show.,10,29 September 2001,"I have to say I absolutely loved the first Rush Hour, so I was eagerly anticipating this sequel when I first heard of it's impending arrival. I wasn't disappointed either... the movie is even more entertaining than the first one. Granted, the Chan-Tucker relationship doesn't go much further than the cultural-differences jokes so prevalent in the original Rush Hour, but it's still hilarious. And the action scenes are again well-choreographed, perhaps even moreso than those in the first movie, which were quite good in their own right.However, the big difference between Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2, and therefore what makes the sequel better than the original, is the quality of the supporting cast. Whereas the first movie offered villains with very little conviction, and the usual bunch of clueless FBI agents, this movie features three superb performances from John Lone, Roselyn Sanchez and Zhang Ziyi.Ah, Zhang Ziyi. I haven't yet seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but I will definitely make a point to do so after seeing her in this movie. Gorgeous, spunky, and incredibly incandescent despite a relatively limited role assigned to her character, her presence really sets Rush Hour 2 apart from not only the original Rush Hour, but also most other films in the action/comedy genre. Watch out for her fight scene with Tucker towards the end... it's the best moment in the film.There's a third Rush Hour on it's way I gather, which can be good or bad. Assuming the exponential growth in terms of overall quality between the first Rush Hour and this second installment can be continued, Rush Hour 3 should be brilliant. If, however, it follows the pattern of the pitiful third chapter from other previously great movies (Jurassic Park is a good example), then forget it, and savour the laughs and thrills provided by Rush Hour 2 instead.9/10",Rush Hour 2

In this way, the film plays a lot like American Pie 2: both took what was popular with the original and really stuffed it into the second.  But ""Rush Hour 2"" does work well--unless you didn't like the first one.  (I didn't like American Pie 2, although seeing it in the theater on opening day with people who DID like it was fun.)  ""Rush Hour 2"" makes Chris Tucker's character louder, the plot even more non-existent (and yet somewhat confusing), and there's even a heavier dosage on the relationship between Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.  If any of this rubbed you the wrong way in the original, my advice is to stay away.However, I did enjoy the first one.  And, as far as laughs and action go, I did enjoy this one more.  Still, I'll give this one the same score I gave the first one (7).

This film was a cultural delight as the writers mixed east with west with hip-hop with the beauty of Spain (courtesy of Rosalyn Sanchez). One of the greatest elements was the ability of both Tucker and Chan to perform well through all of the many fighting sequences, displaying in full the characters that many have grown to love.  Tucker depicted the same funny man of Friday, his stand-up with Def Comedy Jam, and the original Rush Hour. Chan packed the same punches as he has in all of his countless films. Chan was funny; Tucker was hilarious! From the opening scene to the courtesy outtakes Rush Hour 2 delivered.",Rush Hour 2

But in Rush Hour 2, the plot is better(In Rush Hour it was a little slow to start, but i understand since they had to develope the main characters), it's funny throughout the whole movie.  If you're a Chris Tucker fan or Jackie fan you'll love it. Even if you're not you still might think it's good.  For once the people took time on this movie(the first came out 3 years ago) Instead of rushing it( Scary Movie 2) and the result is great.  Can't wait for Rush Hour 3( considering this sequel will do better at the Box Office than the original, which has a VERY HUGE chance of happening).  *** of ****(even though i can't think of anything bad about this movie...but no movie is completely perfect).",Rush Hour 2

Luckily, RH2 serves up a double dose of action and comedy that may have even outgunned the original.Overall viewpoint of the movie may be whether or not you mind Tucker's ranting mouth, but (as always) Jackie Chan is always a charmer. Only heavy flaws may be a few forced jokes and a slightly contrived story. Still, a great summer getaway.",Rush Hour 2

I love Jackie Chan, but this movie had nothing to offer except boredom and offense.  It was like a giant blanc mange with a vague flavour of foot odour.  The only 'jokes' were one liners about how black Chris Tucker was, or how Asian Jackie Chan and everyone in Hong Kong were.  Chris Tucker's shrill, constantly hysterical delivery grated severely.  The fight scenes were even uninspired, which is inexcusable in a Jackie Chan movie.  This can be blamed less on the choreography and much more on the director/cinematographer.  This was one of the most poorly shot movies I have seen all year.  The shots were ambiguous and too many were mid-range, the pacing was poor and the ""establish the excitement of a casino by showing shots of chips, money and dice"" segment was so hackneyed it looked like a cheap travelogue from the 70s.  Characters were flat and predictable.  'Oh, black guy on screen:  he will make some comment about how black he is, then perhaps comment on the Asian-ness of his friend.  Oh, pretty girl on screen, let's watch her undress.  Here comes a homosexual, let's have a few jokes at his expense and watch his performance be forced and too heavy-handed even for camp' (at this point we left, and complained bitterly all the way to the car that each of us had not told the other that we wanted to leave earlier.)  This movie was so bad it has me wondering if I was giddy the day I watched the first Rush Hour, because I remembered enjoying it. It's a sad day when a show is so bad that you feel ripped off after paying $2.50 (CDN!)to see it. Save your money and your time.",Rush Hour 2

234,nemalichandu,Ever green and ever best,10,25 May 2018,"If you're looking for an action-comedy packed movie, well this is one of those movies. Jackie Chan and Chris tucker making one of the greatest and funniest combinations with seemingly brotherly relationship has made the movie a world wide success being the sequel to the movie Rush Hour. Brett Ratner beautifully makes up the symmetry for both the movies and presents before us, an excellent piece of movie, whose every ounce is filled with hilariousness. 
Lee and Carter are off on vacation to Hong Kong where the former suddenly gets to know that the antagonist, Ricky Tan is involved in a suspicious bombing of American Embassy. But knowing Carter, who always wanted a mu shu even if there's a catastrophe, tricks him into a bar disguising the issue to him as a big party and that's where starts the ""revolution"". Lee and Carter are on to catch Ricky Tan and are always on the loosing side, sometimes getting stripped butt naked but also sometimes getting to enjoy the pleasures of Chinese massage. 
The Kinetic energy of Lee and the dynamic mouth of Carter, which can also thank Benjamin , always gets you off the chair , both for laughing and for a wide opened mouth to the stunts of Jackie. All the way through the movie you can see why one can't separate the comedy in Jackie's heroics and Tucker's blasters while they seriously chase Tan. This movie is a complete ripper of stomachs and an ever green classic without an 'F'.",Rush Hour 2
235,ayakoholic,Much better than the original.,9,5 December 2001,"I went to the first Rush Hour, and for the most part, I enjoyed it.  But something bugged me:  Rush Hour was a movie with Jackie Chan in it, but it wasn't a *Jackie Chan Movie.*Rush Hour 2 was, and it made all the difference.  It's all about fight scenes and physical comedy, and Rush Hour 2 delivered.  Sure, the plot's a bit weak and some of the jokes are dumb, particularly the tragically misused Jeremy Piven sequence.  But from the moment Jackie starts climbing up that scaffolding, you know you're in for a great ride.",Rush Hour 2

When I heard there was a sequal, I thought ""bad idea"". My hopes were lowered when other sequals this year have been dreadful. After I saw Rush Hour 2 my thoughts were ""better than the original"". The plot may be thin and if you don't like Chris Tucker you won't like this film because he is in every scene. Chan is showing his age but he can still pack punches. But the real star is Zhang Zihi, she is the best, she is gonna be the next big thing. Action - great. Comedy - great. Film - Excellent.Overall, this movie was great, this movie has even made me think that there is enough steam left to make a Rush Hour 3 or 4. Bring 'em on!",Rush Hour 2
237,zebradawn,Better than the first,10,8 August 2001,Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker do it again.  Found this one better than the first.  More action and way funnier.

The plot is wafer thin, occasionally nonsensical and most inconsequential, but...Jackie Chan is incapable of being dull and even when he's not in the midst of his trademark hi octane kung fu fights and stunts, he has more than enough charisma to lift the film above it's so-so plotting.Chris Tucker is also rather amusing (note to certain critics: his character is supposed to be annoying/funny, not a commentary on inter-racial relations!) and has several fall about lines.The best way to approach this film is to put your brain in the refrigerator, head for the cinema and prepare to be entertained!PS Do not head for home until the credits finish - one of the outakes is one of the funniest yet in a Chan film.",Rush Hour 2

Only net is Tucker shoots his mouth off too much.  If I were a cop, I would have shot him.  Chan stunts are good.  From the first ""Rush Hour"" won him a little more American fame.

245,ecarbo2001,Good buddy movie and decent follow up,6,5 August 2001,"I had always looked forward to seeing Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker get back together to make a sequel to the movie ""Rush Hour"".  The second time around was a successful mix of action, martial arts mayhem, and comedic moments but I don't think that it lived up the previous movie.  Jackie Chan is up to his usual tricks with martial arts acrobatics and Chris Tucker is the biggest mouth the East has ever seen.  There is definite chemistry between these two, though still, not as much as in the original.There were good comedic moments and genuine laugh out loud segments but I felt that many of the jokes were forced and too obvious to really elicit a full guffaw on the laugh 'o meter but this will probably be one of the funnier movies of the summer.  Chris Tucker's energy is always evident in his bravado, arrogance, and obnoxiousness.  Someone somewhere felt that the secret to movie success in a sequel was to have more of the same, although louder and more of it.  It didn't work for me here as it bordered on tiresome.The action sequences as genuine Jackie Chan with furniture manipulations and environmental happenstance while mixing in speed and good technique.  In that way, the martial arts fight scenes are superior to ""Kiss of the Dragon"" because the viewer is more able to see what is actually going on, who gets hit where, and how.  Of course, having the fantastic talents of the lead from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" can only help and up the ante. Appearing small and fragile, she hides incredible talent behind evilly intense eyes.  She really seemed to enjoy beating the crap out of people in this movie.  Gotta love a person that gets into their role.  Hopefully, she will branch out and work on more varied and emotionally demanding roles and avoid being type cast as a martial arts maiden that can act, rather than an actress with physical skills.Over all, not one of Jackie's best movies, or funniest.  While inferior to the original ""Rush Hour"", still a worthwhile movie and I don't regret losing two hours out of my life for this.  Jackie Chan is slowing down in his movies but he still knows how to take a cup of martial arts, pour in a pack of physical and verbal humor, and serve up 2 hours of an entertainment quiche that is light, yet filling.",Rush Hour 2

I didn't think that a sequel would work well with a movie like Rush Hour.  Boy was I wrong!  I remember walking out of the original Rush Hour saying, ""that was pretty good, but it could be better.""  I walked out of Rush Hour 2 saying, ""wow, what a great movie!"" Rush Hour 2 has everything you want in a movie -- action, comedy, and beautiful women!  This is my favorite movie.  I don't see how anyone cannot like it.

Chan and Tucker are a great combo, combining both the martial arts moves of Chan's and the comedy stylings of Tucker.  Not only that, but the two are quite good at changing roles: Chan can be a comedian and Tucker can do some martial arts of his own.There is a chemistry between Chan and Tucker that hasn't existed since the Odd Couple's Jack Lemon and Walter Mathow(?).  These two work great together!Not only that, but they stand out individually as well.  Tucker is a laugh a minute - from the beginning to the end of the movie, there wasn't a thing he says that wasn't funny.  And of course there is Jackie Chan's masterful martial arts moves that I believe are up there with Bruce Lee and Jet Li.This is a must see movie.

I was hoping for a fast-paced comedy/action, but unfortunately the movie failed to deliver on either. It's a tired and dull rehash of the first Rush Hour.For an action movie, it is very slow moving, and what little action there is, it does not look good. Most of the comedy is the same jokes from the first one ie: Chris Tucker being a loudmouth and the Chinese/Black culture jokes.If you're a fan of Tucker's comedy, you might like this movie, but otherwise it's best to avoid.3/10",Rush Hour 2
254,shyamali108,The student film maker's approach to Rush Hour 2: Movement,8,18 January 2006,"Rush Hour II""It's all your fault we're going through all of this. Man, I just wanted to take a break and get some mushu!"" That's exactly what Detective Carter had in mind as a perfect vacation. Rush Hour II. . . . Where action is fast and tempers are hot. Our heroes, Insp. Lee (Jackie Chan) and his partner Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) are in Hong Kong, Lee's home town and Chris's dream opportunity to get some mushu. One day into the trip however, the detectives face adversity. Someone has exploded a bomb at the U. S embassy and the Insp. Lee is ready to take up the case. Carter is not. The FBI have had enough of the antics of the two 'crazy' detectives but the Chinese government are concerned that this may be the latest crime along with a huge counterfeit scheme of Ricky Tan (John Lone). They plead with Lee to take up the case; Ricky was a close friend of Lee's father. Lee accepts the case and explains the situation to his partner, Detective Carter. Carter is outraged that Lee has spoiled his idea of a true vacation, but accepts anyways. The detective duo get into some comical situations, especially because of Carter's hot temper, his attempts to speak Chinese, and his downright inability at kung-fu, Lee's specialty. Director Brett Ratner's usage of movement is spectacular, with excellent usage of dolly shots, kinetics, and conventions. As Detective Lee becomes more and more involved with the case, his colleague Carter is unable to resist becoming embroiled along side him. Both get into crazy situations simply out of concern for one another. In one hilarious scene, the duo, on a look out for Ricky Tan get tipped off by the Chinese government about his whereabouts. He is said to be at a posh salon called ""Heaven on Earth"". The detectives go to the salon, while Lee briefs Carter on their mission. As they are trying to blend in, Ricky Tan walks into the salon and Lee points him out to Carter. Carter's temper gets completely out of control and the scene becomes violent. Both detectives are stripped of their clothes, and they run for their lives. Dolly shots are used as the duo weaves between the heavy traffic. The camera is placed on a dolly and the director moves in, out, or alongside the actors. As the actors run towards their office, the camera moves with them, through the traffic, on to the sidewalk, up the stairs, while Carter yells at Lee for not listening to his ""martial arts advice."" Detective Lee's action skills are tested while he is trying to deal with Carter's temper and a murderous gang, the Triads. Carter's reaction to Lee's concern and anxiety? Lee: These men are Triads. The most deadly gang in China. James Carter: You think they scare me? I'm from Los Angeles, man. We invented gangs! Lee's kung-fu scenes are choreographed with considerable kinetic grace. He is forced to use his kung-fu skills through most of the movie, owing to the fact that he is facing a brutal gang leader- Rick Tan and a beautiful assassin- Hu Li (Ziyi Zhang). He fights considerably well, despite being nearly butt-naked or helpless. He escapes sticky situations simply by the superb choreography of Jackie Chan. Conventions are the usage of symbolic expressions to portray emotions and feelings. In Rush Hour II, many conventions are used before the true action surfaces. Carter and Lee soon find out that they aren't the only ones assigned to nab the criminals. Isabella Molina (Rosalyn Sanchez) has been put to the task by the FBI. She informs Carter and Lee about a truck that is filled with counterfeit money. As the camera enters the truck, the detectives' absence becomes obvious with the ominous silence. The camera focuses on one statue after another and one is left with the thought that the detectives may be in one of the statues. Sure enough, they are tied to the back of the statues and we find out later that the statues are relatively important; they are filled with the counterfeit money. Thus, before we can find out anything about the detectives or their whereabouts, the camera has placed a symbolic importance on the statues. Rush Hour II is a comedy of movement. Beginning in Hong Kong and ending in California, the detective duo get lesser mushu and more action then they had expected. The movie is great, with its major spots being dolly shots, kinetics, and conventions. It is, after all a Jackie Chan movie, so ""Get ready for a second rush!""",Rush Hour 2

Chris Tucker did great in The Fifth Element, but seeing him freak out like a frantic drag queen for 90 minutes is more than I can appreciate, even on a good day. I don't think the action sequences are impressive, good old Mr. Chan has done so much better in the past, and his acting skills are questionable to say the least. The humor is best suited kids, shame about all the violence.",Rush Hour 2
260,thaistar,Same tired old formula lacks humor or imagination.,1,19 August 2001,"Roselyn Sanchez is the only redeeming feature of this movie. Her undercover role, or was it her underwear, made her stand out as the best actor in this flick. I think we'll be seeing a lot more of her. Jackie Chan should hire some real writers and come up with something better than just turning the crank with these tired old chop suey acrobat B-movies. Many failed attempts at humor with the exception that Chris Tucker's performance was a joke throughout the film. It seems arrogant that they shortened this film to 1:45, must be in a rush to whip out the next stinker in an hour.",Rush Hour 2
261,areynaldo,"Lots of fun, but supporting actresses given short shrift",7,6 August 2001,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rush Hour 2,"" as I did its predecessor.  I would have liked to see more of Jackie Chan's amazing stunts, though. The two women in supporting roles, playing Isabella and Hu Li, had some good fight scenes, but we knew next to nothing about these women (in contrast to, say, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""). Perhaps ""Rush Hour 3"" will make room for more female character development, and for a little more romance.  The ""Lethal Weapon"" movies were buddy movies about a pair of cops too, but managed to flesh out the guys' love interests nicely. And why was Jackie Chan paid so much less than Chris Tucker?  I think they should both have been rewarded equally, as each is equally responsible for the movie's success.",Rush Hour 2
262,Spendant,chris and jackie kick butt,10,3 September 2001,"This is one of the best films I've seen in my life, It's definitely in my top ten list. I loved the first rush, it ruled, but this one is off the hook, as good as the first one is this one is ten times better if that's possible. Chris gets the comedy and jackie gets the action and they mix it up and it blends out perfectly. I recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor, because everybody in the audience (including me and my brother) laughed until the end. I give this movie 10 out of 10 stars because it's funnier than hilarious. I think one of the funniest things they said is were lee tells carter that he was going to slap him back to africa, do yourself a favor go see this if you go to a movie, THANKS.P.S. don't forget to watch the hilarious out takes at the end.",Rush Hour 2
263,smartytiff,funnier then i thought it would be,10,5 August 2001,"This movie is hilarious! i loved it. it was better than the first one. if you wanna decide if you wanna see it or not, i totally would say ""YES!"" i totally recommend this to everyone. there's more action and it's more funnier. so please see this and i know you will enjoy this as much as i enjoyed it!",Rush Hour 2
264,stevenxx88,good movie but not so good special effects!,7,29 October 2006,"Well, i watched this movie after i saw rush hour. i knew that rush hour was a big hit, even though i didn't see it till i was about 10 in 2003. So, after i decided to rent the sequel, rush hour 2. I figured since the first one was great, i figured the second one would be good to. I was right but wrong. the plot for the first one was sweet and to the point, no crappy punchlines or anything, it was just easy to comprehend. whereas the second one confused me and all of my friends. I mean come on! first its that huli girl and the triads, then somehow that Ricky tan guy comes in, then one way or another that Steven reign guy comes in. If you ask me its kinda fricken stupid. and not only that the special effects suck. the blood and guns were okay. but the fighting was a joke. the punches were about 2 feet away, the sound effects were terrible, and when the best part of the fight scene in the massage parlor comes, to finish it off, when lee and carter lock hands and do the kick thing (from the first one), the kicks clearly go behind their heads because they go past behind, so it almost looks like its going through the heads, i mean come on! And one part, where carter so called hits the Chinese guy with the metal box, its like 3 feet away, almost like the godfather punch! And to make it even worse, if you look closely, the Chinese guy, as he gets hit by the box, he at first turns his head the wrong way! im 12 almost 13 years old and i could do better special effects. Anyway i recommend the first one definitely, for action and comedy, but the second for just comedy, though they try to make it actiony by doing the fight scenes, though they sucked, so it truly isn't action, just comedy.",Rush Hour 2
265,knjsmith,Every bit as good as the original..,10,3 August 2001,"Fans of the first Rush Hour will NOT be disappointed. The action is first rate and the humor is abundant. Jackie's stunts don't seem to be as death-defying as they were in his Hong Kong era movies, but they are still amazingly choreographed. I don't know what you might be looking for in a cop/buddy movie that this one doesn't deliver.",Rush Hour 2
266,Moofpocket,"On par with the original, maybe even better!",8,3 August 2001,"A movie like Rush Hour 2 isn't worth too much intellectualization and analysis, but here are a few things that I think are worth noting.1)  This movie is just as good if not better at times than the original!  It doesn't suffer from much ""sequelitis"" as only a few of the lines/gimmicks from the original are used, and it's done well so that it's funny and not annoying.2)  A much better villain set in this film.  I won't give anything away, but surprisingly it kept me guessing all along.  The female villain (who was also in Crouching Tiger) is excellent.  The female leads are both quite appealing to the eye as well.  :)3)  I liken Tucker & Chan to be a great team.  They could possibly do another sequel or two a la Gibson and Glover from the Lethal Weapon series. A different relationship between the characters, but I think it works just as well!If you need a good laugh go and expect a good time.  If you liked the first one, you should definitely love this one.  If you didn't see the first one, still go and check this out.  I look forward to more Chan and Tucker hopefully.  :)PS:  Make sure you watch the outtakes during the credits too!",Rush Hour 2
267,Johnts,It's not Rush Hour,7,2 September 2001,"This is not as good as the original and I wish I had waited for the video to see it, I saw it a discount time.  There was no real plot, it was very noisy, and the action scenes were to much like a copy of the original. The out takes were great!!!",Rush Hour 2
268,Fettmaster,A better than average sequel,8,5 August 2001,"My expectations for Rush Hour 2 were very low.  The previews were simply jokes from the first film, and didn't excite me at all.  However, being the devoted Jackie Chan fan that I am, I saw this one anyway and was surprised at how often I laughed.  The jokes in this film are at the very least 80% original and almost all of them work.  As a matter of fact, the only ones that really fail are the recycled jokes from Rush Hour 1.  This movie is no Scorcese, Coppola or Bergman, but it is a really fun, stupid good time.",Rush Hour 2
269,jhhurst,Action with good timing,7,12 August 2001,This movie has lots of action and laughs with good timing. The actors were well suited for their parts although I felt at times quit over intense. The story is good but predictable. I left the theater smiling.,Rush Hour 2
270,le_singe_etrange,Worst.Jackie Chan movie. Ever.,1,10 August 2001,"I really enjoy Jackie Chan. He's a great martial-artist, and funny too. I was then thoroughly mortified to have  paid $6.75 to go watch this horribly unfunny, unwatchable movie. I dont want to sound full of myself or that im better than other people, but this was so full of bathroom humor and complete nonsense that i had my hands over my face the entire time this movie was going on. All the rest of the Baltimorons behind me laughing and choking behind me made me want to cry. Chris Tucker is the worst caricature of a Black man since Leroy Brown from the Charlie(not Jackie) Chan movies. The bug eyes, the high pitched voice, that plucky young Black man always after a piece of tail, i was so saddened. I felt like i was watching a 1930's movie, he was SOOOO the stereotype of that era. I'm white, but i was ashamed to sit and watch as the other white people in the theater laughed at this picture of Blacks. Don't see this movie, im warning you. If its on tv, or u see it over a friends, fine. No harm. but please, please dont buy or rent this yourself folks, or see it in the theatres. $6.75 is not worth the trip.",Rush Hour 2
271,mswindale,even better than the first,7,4 August 2001,"this film was hillarious from the opening scene to the final scene. Probably better than the first which is a task in itself.Chris Tucker is getting funnier by the film and ... well ... Jackie Chan is Jackie Chan !  Chris Tucker learning a bit of martial arts helped the film as well.
I look forward to Rush Hour 3, 4, 5 & 6 !!!!",Rush Hour 2
272,rhenkel,"Simple, silly, predictable fun",7,4 August 2001,"If you want to see an aging but agile Jackie Chan kick butt once more, Chris Tucker of the machine gun mouth and no discernable plot, this is 90 minutes of escapist entertainment not at it's best but worth the time.One doesn't expect an intelligent script, but what is missing is the lack of plot twists or, for that matter, a plot. The only twist, involving the movie's only real actor (John Lone), is all to predictable.
It is lamentable that Ziyi Zhang, a wonderful presence in Crouching Tiger, is pretty much a fluff piece. I realize she is not a true martial artist but a real director was able to make her look like one before. The little she is used exploits none of her talents except beauty.That said, one must judge a movie on it's ability to execute to it's goal. In that respect, RH2 is a success. It will put cheeks in seats and make money. It has lots of action with reasonably well choreographed fight scenes, it has beautiful girls (2 does make it plural) and the heroes live to sequel another day, given adequate grosses.",Rush Hour 2
273,bbmovie,Great movie!,7,7 August 2001,"It surely is a great movie. Jacky and Tucker are so funny. People including me and my friend were laughing all the time, especially the last part after the formal one was done and before the cast came out. I suggest everybody should go to see it. You won't regret it.Only complain is Zhang ZiYi was somehow stupid as an evil character, although she was beautiful. But wait, I like the way how she made her hair-do, that was cool... Well, if you don't know what I am talking about, go see the movie!!",Rush Hour 2

Trust me GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!",Rush Hour 2

Not having any preconceptions may have helped in my enjoying the film as much as I did. I laughed quite a bit and left the film feeling very entertained. The plot is rather thin, but the action scenes are fantastic. The combination of Tucker and Chan still has the same comedic flare as the first film. Don't go in this movie expecting cinematic art, but if you are looking to be entertained and have some laughs, ""Rush Hour 2"" is definitely for you. Be sure to stay through the end credits, the out takes shown during the credits are great!",Rush Hour 2
277,tater11,They're back and better than ever.,10,7 August 2001,"I don't know how the critics can put this one down.  But who can blame them? I guess they have a pretty boring and dull life to not be in hysterics by the end of this movie.  Now the original Rush Hour continues to be one of my favorite movies, but I think Rush Hour 2 will move up there pretty soon. Basically all of the most hilarious jokes from the first one have been ironically modified to make them even more funny in the second one.  And who can look past the fight scenes?  Jackie Chan has created some of the most intense and entertaining fight scenes for this movie.  So my basic verdict is this:  the ""professional critics"" are wrong--this movie is awesome.  I highly recommend it.",Rush Hour 2

I was thoroughly depressed after having wasted money and time by watching Swordfish (possibly the worst movie after Battlefield Earth), so I needed cheering up.  I decided to watch Rush Hour 2 the day it came out, and I was surprised as in my opinion it was better than the first! It even had better stunts, more suspense and a less predictable storyline than Swordfish....(sorry i'm thrashing it). I went out of the cinemas and I couldn't stop talking about the out-takes at the end - which proved all(?) stunts were genuinely done by the man himself, the king of slapstick kung-fu, Jackie Chan!!! However one minor gripe was that it had nothing to do with the title ""Rush Hour"", but that's about it for this hilarious movie that made me laugh out loud for the most part of the movie.I rate it 10/10 for non stop gags, one liners which don't make you want to groan out loud (ie Swordfish...sorry), and for cheering up my summer big time. Hmmm I might even buy this one on DVD...",Rush Hour 2

Did it revolutionize the comedy genre? NO. Did it give me more respect for Tucker's comedy or Chan's martial arts abilities??? No........... ......but it did do something far more important than all of those things up above. Something I believe that critics can no longer understand. I WAS THROUGHLY ENTERTAINED....Isn't that what's most important about a movie that you see, anyway! You get what you pay for.When I went to the theater to see RH2, I wanted to laugh. And laugh I did throughout 90% of the film. In fact at some parts I almost hurt myself. I wanted to see something to amuse me. Not take me to some fast, far away place or have  some deep plot with 3/4/5-dimensional characters....... PLEASE, if I wanted all of that, I would attend film school, or make plans to see a Broadway play.Yes, the critics are right the plot of this film is thin. Yes, there is hardly no character development at all. Yes you can probably tell how this movie is going to end by the first 45 minutes of the film. BUT WHO CARES!!!! It was funny. PERIOD. I laughed and I enjoyed myself.There is no need to talk about what happens in RH2. The bottom line is this. See the movie if:You can get into Chris Tucker's comedyYou like Jackie Chan's stuntwork/comedyYou want to be entertained and have a good laughYou aren't trying to take a movie too seriuoslyYou want to escape another boring or cheap eveningThere you have it plain and simple. Do you want to watch a fun and light-hearted comedy that's hillarious and silly; yet not so silly that it becomes ridiculous and stupid...then go see RH2. So go and enjoy a evening out with a dinner and a movie. If that movie just so happens to be RH2, then you'll probably get a good chuckle of laughter during the procees.",Rush Hour 2

Why do i say this?!  because im a huge fan of both Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker.  I believe this time around, they(jackie and Chris) had more freedom in this movie.  Rush Hour 2 is one movie that couldnt get enough hype.  So do yourself a favor..Forget Final Fantasy,Dont waste your money on Tomb Raider and wait for JP3 on video...Go see Rush Hour 2!

I walked out of the theater after seeing Rush Hour 2, and there was not a doubt in my mind that this movie was worth every penny I spent, and then some!  It's very rare that I feel a movie was really worth going to the theaters to see, but this one put a grin on my face for the rest of the night!  I had trouble remembering a specific funny scene in the movie, simply because it was THAT funny!  Chris Tucker is one nutty character, but teamed up with the excitement and chaos of Jackie Chans martial arts, makes this movie a non-stop action-packed laughter ride! I have a hard time deciding if it was even funnier than the first movie! If you're up for some wild excitement and hilarious comedy, this is the movie to see!

291,porchia,Great Tandem,10,15 August 2001,These guys work great together.  Great Tag Team.  In my opinion you can't get enough of both of them.  The big improvement from the last film was that Chris Tucker didn't over act as much this time.  Not only was that refreshing but if made the movie better.  He actually looked comfortable in what he was doing on screen.  Wouldn't mind seeing a Rush Hour3.  But most importantly I wouldn't mind seeing these two teaming up for other projects. Danny Glover and Mel Gibson were good together.  Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan are Great together.  In my opinion there isn't a better tandem.I hope we get to see them together in other projects.,Rush Hour 2

And what try ! The second movie is just far better from the first, the action never stops and the duo (Chan and Tucker) works just so fine !!! It's a movie I would strongly recommend for everybody, even older people, everybody can have fun with this movie, it is not bloody, bad or scary, it is just funny !!!",Rush Hour 2

Although, the storyline wasn't so bad (in fact, all story lines are good and bad). Throughout the movie, I dosed off a few times. I know that Jackie Chan is a great martial arts expertise, but not a good actor in Rush Hour 2. Chris Tucker, too, wasn't good. And Zhang Ziyi, what can I say, a few lines, terrible acting (But that's based on her script). All the characters there were not that good. But, some of the things I like in Rush Hour 2 is always the action and less sex scenes. I know that Jackie Chan doesn't do those things which is good for him.",Rush Hour 2

The action is, as always, superb, with even Chris Tucker getting in on the action. However, when the credits started to roll at the end of the film I was left questioning the wisdom in making what is essentially a Hong Kong movie with a Hollywood crew. Jackie Chan is an artist when it comes to stunts but in this movie I felt that he was being held back by the limitations of the studio/producers/director/whatever. If the powers that be behind Jackie's US movie career were to give him more freedom over his action then I think that between them they could produce some truly amazing movies. Having said that, this is still a good film and definitely one worth seeing.",Rush Hour 2

It's perfect for the whole family, or just a movie night with friends, or even a bored plane ride. They go to china and America. They go to Las Vegas. The part where they go to the casino is funny.
