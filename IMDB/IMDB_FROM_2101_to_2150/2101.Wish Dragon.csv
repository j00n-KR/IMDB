0,Hitchcoc,Nice Film,8,11 August 2021,"Though I am not much for modern animation, my grandkids talked me into seeing this. It is a delightful romp as it takes a young guy who was in love as a child and connects him with a dragon/genie, who can grant three wishes. The girl in question moved away from humble roots and the young man began to search for her. The fun in the story is that the dragon has a great personality. Reviewers say it's not Aladdin but it really is. Obviously, there are other plot elements (it takes place in China), but there are way too many similarities. It's a cure movie that moves along and stays engaging.",Wish Dragon
1,view_and_review,Uniquely Unoriginal,4,18 July 2021,"This movie was very unimpressive. I felt like I was watching a bunch of much better movies all rolled into one.The main character is Din (Jimmy Wong). He and Li Na (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) were best friends until Lina had to move out of the area. The movie skips ahead ten years to Din and Lina being nineteen-year-olds and living their separate lives. Din is a food delivery driver in his old neighborhood while Lina is a famous model. Din has been stuck on Lina for the past ten years and wants to meet her again, but they are no longer in the same geographic area or social circles.Then Din received a magical teapot with a magical dragon that could grant him three wishes. Stop me if you've heard this before. Not only was it a blatant copy of the genie in the lamp, the dragon reminded me of Disney's ""Raya and the Dragon"" that came out earlier this year.Din's first wish was a spontaneous wish for fighting skills to fight off the bad guys who were trying to wrest the teapot away from him. If that wish could be forgiven, the next one couldn't. Din wanted a way to see Lina, but he was a poor delivery boy while she was a rich model, hence he had no way of entering her presence. He wished to be wealthy for twenty-four hours to give him the opportunity to join her social gathering. This wish was a Netflix attempt to show the rest of us how selfish we are and how altruistic and pure Din was. Because while most of us would simply have wished to be wealthy, Din didn't want wealth, he only wanted what would gain him access to his crush. What was supposed to be a move to show his nobility only showed his naivety. Yes, wealth gives you access to certain places, things, and people; that's why so many people want it!The movie further frustrated me when Din got that coveted meeting with Lina. She didn't recognize him, which is understandable, but instead of simply saying he was her childhood friend Din, he pretended to be some rich guy named Dan because perhaps she wouldn't be interested in her simple childhood friend.1. That's super cliche.2. Why would you want to be friends with her if she's now too good for you?He further made an arse of himself when they went to lunch and he couldn't even be himself because he was taking dating instructions from his dragon as if it was Cyrano De Bergerac. The dragon, named Long (John Cho), was giving the worst advice. Din would've been better off going to a fortune cookie for dating tips.When we finally got past the absurd charade and Lina found out who he was, the movie trended upward. Din sat on his last wish for dramatic effect and then used it in a way that would make him a hero. But he wouldn't use it before we saw the bad guy Pockets (Aaron Yoo) make the incredibly dumb wish of turning everything he touched into gold. Yes, that is a King Midas reference. I don't know who wrote this, but it was asinine and played out. Pockets didn't strike me as being stupid, yet he made a stupid wish. How about wishing for a pile of gold instead of the burdensome, dangerous, and limiting wish of turning things to gold with a touch? Ugh!This movie was trite and tired. It was unique in how unoriginal it was. I struggled to watch and only did so because my daughter wanted to see it, but what does an eleven-year-old know?",Wish Dragon
2,briancham1994,Wholesome and funny if derivative,7,18 June 2021,"As the reviewers have pointed out, this film is a clear derivative of the Aladdin folktale with a setting update to modern Shanghai and some comedic shades of the Disney adaptation. However, it transcends its roots with memorable characters, a compelling emotional storyline, exciting fights, a wholesome message and expressive animation. In particular, the realistic depths of the setting and main personalities were very lifelike and totally immersed the audience in the story.",Wish Dragon
3,matthewssilverhammer,my favorite 2021 Netflix kid's film,7,6 October 2021,"The comparisons to Aladdin are apt. A funny genie, a lower-class guy and upper-class girl connecting on similar emotional state, inability to wish for love, wishes to be a prince(ling), the villain has been looking for genie for a long time, themes of trust and lies. It gets away with it, though, by recognizing the connection and finding ways to subvert it. Long the Dragon's arc is strong, there are several very funny moments (traffic scene is excellent), and the animation is beautiful.",Wish Dragon
4,RosanaBotafogo,"Good message for children, reflection for adults...",7,21 June 2021,"How cute, the action scenes always seem boring and tiring, but except for this detail, which all good animation has, the film manages to inspire and conquer, Din and the Dragon, cute, perfect chemistry, but what won all my love were Din and Li Na children, so highly enthralling, nice to watch, good message for children, reflection for adults...",Wish Dragon
5,lisafordeay,Nice film with a familiar storyline from Disney,5,11 June 2021,"Wish Dragon is a 2021 Sony Pictures Animation and Netflix animated fantasy starring Jimmy Wong and John Cho. The film is about a young boy named Din who's best friends with a girl since he was a kid. But when Nina and Din part ways,a few years later he decides to track her down. However all is about to change when Din stumbles across a mysterious teapot that unleashes a magical dragon who helps Din with his wishes.Will Din find Nina and romance may spark between them or does he have to pretend to be something his not.Now I know what your thinking hey this is Aladdin only set in China. And your correct it is a knock off of Aladdin. We've got a boy who's somewhat poor,we have him falling in love with a rich girl,he gets help from a magic dragon Long (voiced by John Cho)instead of a genie,and we have an evil dude who wants the mystic teapot. Oh and did I forget to tell you that dragon used to be a human(just like Will Smith's Genie from Aladdin 2019)who was transformed into a dragon.Overall if you love Aladdin and How To Train Your Dragon then do check it out. I liked it despite the unoriginality of the plot.",Wish Dragon
6,GiraffeDoor,"Unlike the Aladin remake, I COULD wish for more",7,6 August 2021,"Chic and appealing adventure that makes one think of Aladin more than once but does have a very different story to tell.The depiction of Asian technocracy living right next door to the ghetto is very immersive and the visual humor is well polished.To be honest, I liked these characters best as kids; Dong is still OK but the other one just seems to have lost her personality in puberty. The plot is somewhat confusing because he appears to squander his wishes and is way too suggestable to the dragon.He's the best character and he's fun to watch.The most impressive aspect of this movie is that they were able to create a villain that was formidable and yet still no less comedic for it.",Wish Dragon
7,yusufpiskin,Netflix & Sony,6,12 June 2021,"Jackie Chan, John Cho, Will Yun Lee, Ian Chen and Max Charles. One of the fruits of the Netflix / Sony collaboration. It was a very satisfying production, both script and technique. It is good that Sony side gets out of the American stories and gets their hands on global stories.",Wish Dragon
8,andrewchristianjr,ALADDIN MADE IN CHINA.,7,20 June 2021,"This film is literally an Aladdin made in China, with one or two ""wow"" moments. You'll discover who is the antagonist on the first 10 minutes. It's the most predictable animation since The Secret Life of Pets (which one I liked).",Wish Dragon
9,rannynm,"Great Animation, Unique Plot, Lots of Fantasy!",10,16 June 2021,"Wish Dragon is an animated film sure to entertain family audiences. This new movie, similar to Soul, has a unique plot with plenty of fantastical ideas. A combination of wonderful acting, animation and plot makes for a delightful movie.Wish Dragon follows Din (Jimmy Wong) as he struggles to find his long-lost childhood best friend, Li Na (Natasha Liu Bordizzo). A green teapot then shows itself, and Din soon realizes that it's not your average teapot - there's a dragon inside. The dragon, Long (John Chu), informs Din that he can make three wishes. With the challenge of finding his friend, avoiding the goons that are trying to steal the teapot and keeping the secret of the wish dragon from the rest of his friends and family, Din's quiet life soon becomes a flurry of activity and excitement.The film has some of the best animation I've ever seen. Characters, objects, settings and beings are flawless, aside from when they need to be flawed. Colorful, detailed animation creates a vivid world that's full of life. Everything seems to pop off the screen and I feel as though I've been transported into this world. Along with the animation, the stunning performances by the actors add so much to the film. The voiceovers match the characters and the animated expressions change with the actors' tones. John Cho, voicing Long (the wish dragon), is one of the performances that seems effortless. The dragon's superb appearance mixes nicely with the deeper voice of the actor. Natasha Liu Bordizzo, as Li Na, and Jimmy Wong, as Din, also deliver excellent performances - the voice acting is true to the animation. These two high points are enhanced by its strong plot. In fact, the storyline of Wish Dragon is detailed, relatable and perfect for a family movie. Unique ideas, as well as thoughtful messages and themes, are all here. The characters are strong, enhanced with interesting backstories about their noteworthy pasts. Events throughout the film are well-timed and make sense. There aren't any scenes that seem forced in order to keep the plot going. It all flows well. The only shortcoming that I found is that it is a bit predictable at times. Some of the primary plot points, such as the three wishes and epic battles against the bad guys, are a bit repetitive and predictable. However, it's nothing a little popcorn can't help.The message of Wish Dragon is to understand the importance of relationships and don't be greedy. The film does a noteworthy job of making the messages noticeable without being completely obvious. There are some action scenes, but they are definitely appropriate for kids.I give Wish Dragon 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18 plus adults. Wish Dragon is currently available for streaming on Netflix starting June 11, 2021.Reviewed by Kyla C., KIDS FIRST.",Wish Dragon
10,Aktham_Tashtush,"Even though it would look somewhat familiar, The movie still has its own lovable and enjoyable identity ...",8,14 June 2021,"The movie is as some reviews say a modern era Chinese Aladdin .. and there were actually a lot of similarities in the story of the Dragon/genie but still it felt so enjoyable and the story does feel promising and purposeful with an adequate amount of genuinity.The animation is very well done ,, not like some of the last animations I've watched last year ,, it does look professional, glamorous and easy on the eye.The plot is familiar but again entertaining and put in a modern way, the script is very quick, very connected and definitely very funny which what added that bit originality of movie.The movie is very recommended.",Wish Dragon
11,brookenichole-98054,Really?,3,21 June 2021,"I thought this movie was going to be spectacular, and it's a rip off. A rip off of a very famous movie called Aladdin. Almost every scene is a direct rip off. This movie was super intense for a kids film. Although, I did love getting to see the Chinese heritage.I don't think the dragon was needed, he was kinda dull. Also, I think it should have just been Din finding his childhood best friend and they fall in love.Hopefully they do the second movie right. Now I just want to watch Aladdin.",Wish Dragon
12,Sir_AmirSyarif,A really fun wholesome family film,7,21 June 2021,"While it rehashes a similar fairytale formula from Disney's 'Aladdin' (John Musker, Ron Clements, 1992), Chris Appelhans' 'Wish Dragons' offers enough new elements, charming characters, and gorgeous animation to be entertaining and sweet. Silly at times, but definitely a really fun wholesome family film with a whole lot of genuine heart and good vibes to it.",Wish Dragon
13,Movi3DO,Aladdin coming to China,7,13 June 2021,"Aladdin has come to China, sort of.Based on its own folk tale that is similar to Aladdin, a young man trying to reconnect with his childhood friend acquired a cup that spawned a dragon that could grant him 3 wishes.Even though the premise sounded like an Aladdin copycat, the style and tone were completely different from the classic Arabian tale. The best aspect was the humor, which came mostly from the dragon, voiced by John Cho, experiencing the modern world. For the first half, I was laughing at the silly moments. The jokes weren't fancy or elaborated, but I'm a simple man, so goofy jokes were enough to get my facial muscles going.The animation was pretty typical like the modern Disney animations. The dragon was fluffy and pink, which looked goofy.The relationship between our main boy, Din, and the wish dragon was also another fun part. Again they were goofy and annoyed each other, which provided more funny jokes.The weakest part was the story, which followed many tropes of a Disney-like animated movies. The theme follows a common yet valuable lesson that money can't buy happiness, and that people should cherish those around them. I did like the theme, but I didn't feel a lot of impact because of the predictable storyline and the theme itself, which was told a hundred of times before (but it's still important and relevant).Overall, a simple, enjoyable, and funny story despite the predictable story and theme. 7/10.",Wish Dragon
14,legobuilderpro,Dragon wishes,7,11 June 2021,"The animation was really pretty and has really funny scenes involving Long the wish dragon, also a good voice cast.I liked the main character and his funny dynamic with Long the wish dragon.",Wish Dragon
15,djurrepower,no,3,13 June 2021,"The first and second act are almost exactly like Alladin, beat for beat. The only faintest hint of originality comes in the third act, but at that point you really have to put in effort to keep paying attention.Not to say it's a knockoff. Some chinese culture was well implemented, but the whole modern spin seemed very superficial.There is some hint of critisism on modern chinese culture, but the movie doesn't adress these directly, wich is a lost oppertunity.The only thing directly adressed is materialism, but that isn't really that profound coming from a genie movie.The animation was really bad, with uninspired character disign and juvinile animations.The conflict in the story seemed not very well thought out. And character development felt rushed and unimaginative. So the story was not engaging and predictable.All in all, this is a classic example of how some movies feel like they were made by an algorithm. (thank you tencent)3/10: uninspired and boring.",Wish Dragon
16,raybennetthays,A missed opportunity,3,15 June 2021,"This movie was filled to the brim with potential, but it was brought down by minimal character development and real rough dialogue.It doesn't help that the story barely even makes any sense, and they just phone in other unnecessary additions to the nonsensical story.It's also so unoriginal and the animation looked very poor for Sony, and the ending? Why'd that guy and the dragon turn into gold?",Wish Dragon
17,trinaboice,Aladdin-inspired but so much more,10,24 June 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Sony Pictures Animation combines efforts with a Chinese animation company to introduce a more modern, Chinese spin on the Disney classic Aladdin. In fact, the protagonist's name is Din, shortened from Alladin. This is Sony Animation's second Netflix exclusive movie after the hit The Mitchells vs the Machines, which is a super cute movie I recently reviewed.Writer and Director Chris Applehans explained that he was inspired by Aladdin but then wanted to veer off with some unique Chinese mythology and settings. He is best known for his animation work on movies like Coraline, Disney's The Princess and The Frog, and more recently, WONDER PARK.THINGS I LIKED:
One of my sons married a lovely girl from Hong Kong and they now have their own sweet baby boy. I've been to Hong Kong and mainland China many times and absolutely love the Chinese culture. I love that this movie does a great job teaching Americans and others more about that amazing country and culture. The movie captures so many little details of Chinese life and I'm so glad that Asia has been in the spotlight lately with quite a few movies on Netflix and elsewhere.The Wish Dragon is voiced by John Cho in the English version, but the Mandarin version uses legendary Jackie Chan as the dragon's voice! Jackie Chan is also the film's producer. John Cho also did the voice acting in the cute Netflix movie OVER THE MOON.The beautiful Constance Wu from Crazy Rich Asians voices the mom in the movie.Other famous voice talents included in the cast are Jimmy Wong, Will Yun Lee, Bobby Lee, Natasha Liu Bordizzo, Ronny Chieng, among others.There's a quick scene that shows how fast Shanghai has grown. No kidding. I love that city. It really celebrates the ancient with the modern.The animation is simple but very colorful and sweet with great textures and depth. Lots of purples and pinks are used. The film also incorporates different styles of animation to illustrate specific things.There is a lot of humor for all ages. Lots of cute visual humor that made me laugh out loud. Pay attention to the writing on signs and the body movements.It's really fun to watch the Wish Dragon discover technology and all the magical things that exist in our modern world today.The backstory of the Wish Dragon is revealed slowly but when we learn more, it's concise and extremely powerful. The conversation about what the dragon had learned about humans during the hundreds of years of his life was really profound. Ironically, capitalism is huge right now in China. The entire country is focused on money and fortune. I wonder if the Chinese will actually take notice of this important life lesson in the movie about money and what's truly important in life.The Kung Fu action and kicking sequences are hilarious. One of the characters fights only with his feet while he's wearing a suit and his hands are in his pockets. So funny.The movie's focus wasn't solely focused on love and romance, offering so much more.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
A lot of American viewers might be turned off, thinking this is yet one more thing China has stolen and copied, saying The Wish Dragon is a complete rip-off of the genie in Aladdin and not give this film a chance. While there are a lot of similar elements in the two films, this one really does offer something unique that is worth a watch.Some of the voices didn't quite match the characters' faces.It's really hard to feel sorry for a rich, young, famous, and beautiful girl.There are some endearing side characters that I wish we could have had more time getting to know. Two of the villain's henchmen really didn't blossom until the last few minutes of the movie.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Toilet humor. In fact, American kids won't understand the bidet joke because the typical home in America doesn't have a bidet in the bathroom.There is a nod to the King Midas story that younger children might not be familiar with.Lots of animated violence.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Wish Dragon
18,daisukereds,Much much better than expected,7,14 June 2021,"This is what happens when another company gets Aladdin right better than Disney did with their unnecessary Remake. They understood the structure and how not to mess it up. They also knew what changes to make to make it fresh (with a small change that makes it) on a beaten-to-death story. And even spiced it up with a lot of fun! Was surprised how much I enjoyed it, specially after I watched the trailer. With flowing animations, good characters and an emotional conclusion (and as a whole) that serves as a fine wrapping to an overall great present.High praise and recommendation.** If I had any complaints, I'd say that John Cho just does NOT fit the role of Din. Not with that look of his. His voice is just not ""mature"" enough. Jimmy Wong, on the other hand, is serviceable but doesn't stand out. He is a little old to sell this teenager. It might be his lack of talent (I remember forgetting he was even in Mulan). But unless you know or care, the casting for the 2 main leads works because everything else does and you won't even think about it.",Wish Dragon
19,AdrenalinDragon,If Aladdin was below average,4,12 June 2021,"To nobody's surprise, Wish Dragon was basically a poor man's Aladdin. The jokes for the most part are super basic and a big chunk fall flat. Kids would probably find them alright though. The plot beats are pretty similar, although I did like the change of environments and some story differences. Not the worst thing you could watch, just a bit bland basically. Some of the Animation is decent, but most of it is clean and simple. Voice performances are fine, but the villain was very weak and lacking any depth. Characters have predictable arcs and emotional scenes. Nothing special and below average.4/10.",Wish Dragon
20,sirwillisiv,Harmless fun but could've been more profound...,6,13 June 2021,"Wish Dragon is serviceable, middle-of-the-road fare. The story is highly derivative of Aladdin but also mocks it and I found a handful of the jokes to hit, surprisingly so. I respected the more platonic take on that type of story. It's about someone who just wants to see their best friend again after so many years apart and I find that much more relatable and endearing than ""love at first sight.""I enjoyed the animation. It's snappy, colorful and the environments are stylish and welcoming. With that said, I don't think the characters were strong enough to deliver its familiar but essential message about life's importance in a thought-provoking fashion.I was really into Wish Dragon for the most part, like almost on a Pixar level. About 70% of the film is effectively character-driven but sadly it goes a formulaic, exposition-heavy route upon the third act and it ultimately works against the message it's trying to convey. With a redundant villain throwing a wrench in the works, too, it was kind of a letdown.At the end of the day, though, despite its missed opportunities, Wish Dragon is harmless. The message is still relevant even if it wasn't told in the most profound manner. See it if you'd like, but I'd recommend watching Soul for a more grounded ""meaning of life"" story.",Wish Dragon
21,atractiveeyes,Lovely,7,16 June 2021,"Its main idea is taken from Aladdin and his genie so it has nothing original or special to deliver but it's still a very good enjoyable family movie.

23,witra_as,Easy yet deep animation for all ages,8,10 July 2021,An easy yet deep animation for all ages.

25,daisyisabaker,META! (Stories within stories),10,12 June 2021,"A lot of audience members will unfortunately only see this as a ""knock-off Aladdin"".But the only similarity is that the story involves a boy who finds a ""genie"".--------I'm so happy that Chinese culture is finally getting mainstream representation.There's a lot of hidden jokes that ""laowais"" won't understand, with lots of fun nods towards what you could typically find, whilst roaming through the districts surrounding the Pudong area of Shanghai. There's also Easter Eggs and references to other tales & myths such as the story of King Midas. The main plot point shares a similarity to Boys Over Flowers (amongst many other Korean Dramas too).--------Fabulous voice cast, including those attributed to Crazy Rich Asians.

26,quiqueperezsoler,Already an underrated masterpiece. Modern take on Aladdin featuring Shenlong and Master Roshi,8,13 June 2021,"Many would see this movie as a ""copy"" of Aladdin with hints of Dragon Ball elements (like a wishing dragon and a funny oldman character), however, the brilliancy of this movie is that not only does it acknowledge these similarities even though the story was possibly inspired by an old chinese fable more than the actual 1992 classic; but its refreshing and hilarious take on it makes for a completely new and amazing story worth telling. Yet nobody seems to be talking about it....Sure, it's only been released a couple of days ago but in this day and age, there's always some mention of it (if only in meme format..). Yet, I've scoured the internet.. too little for such a great movie that I hope doesn't fall under the radar like other animation masterpieces out there. Anyways, here's my review:We have seen over and over again the tropes of classism in romantic movies, however, none of them featured such a modern take on them (one we could relate to it so much and with the new backdrop of China's modern culture) and a modern development of a culture like in this one. We go from almost rural Shanghai to super metropolis Shanghai with a leap in technology that allows for many funny scenes and interactions between some of the ""out-of-date"" characters. Not to mention the spot-on screenplay with witty, perfectly timed dialogue.The layers the story displays make the movie so much more enriching and lends for a lot of more rewatches. The subtleties found in the animation and story elements makes the film so fulfilling and enjoyable. And the fact it takes all the similarities with other franchises or media in such a light-hearted and amusing way makes it so much better. If they had ignored or not addressed the current similarities everyone would have reacted more negatively, accusing it of being a rip-off of other works.The modern insertions to a pretty ancient-inspired story makes it so much more realised and blend in so smoothly I had no cringing moments of social-media-referencing or other modern elements that could be a bit on the nose.I have more to say but it'd get into spoilers or possibly reveal elements that, at least when I saw it, were unknown to me. I just want to reiterate that the Chinese backdrop, spanning several settings of China (rural to urban) was very well realised in the animation and felt whimsical and, at times, soothing. Like Studio Ghibli's portrayal of rural and urban Japan (food included, very mouth-watering). And this takes me to the animation, which I would give a 10/10 is just that the removal of spines and any bone in the humans that is so characteristic of Sony Animation feels a bit off-putting, as for the rest: great action sequences, humor, expressions, textures and lighting. 9/10, which is still prety good, is just that I don't share this ""cartoonized take"" on animation, I appreciate it and see the value of having a different style from Disney's and Pixar's, but, at least in 3D animation it's still a little wonky to me. (Had the same complain with Hotel Transilvania)IN CONCLUSION, the story, the dialogue, the action, the humor, the characters (ALL of them), the romance, the Dragon... There's not a weak aspect in my eyes. I don't know if it's because I enjoyed it so much this first time but, I think even though it features so many well-known plot elements: modern take on classism, the be-careful-what-you-wish for, the greed's redemption, friendship and innocent love; all these slice-of-life themes that feel like we haven't seen in its ""purest form"" in a while, they return in this well-realised Chinese-angle-themed refreshing story that opens the eyes and the culture to the rest of the world. Themes that will never get old as they govern our everyday lives, sure there aren't any wishing dragons but we all wish we had a friend like him... ;)",Wish Dragon
27,mailtaskservice,A REGRETTED TO WATCH MOVIE,6,20 October 2021,"I cannot give more than 6/10 simply because this is a lousy made story especially the conclusion although the idea is good.Its a pity that this is just only an average standard movie but below standard animations.

29,pronitmallick,Definitely packs a punch,7,15 June 2021,Wish Dragon is a movie that starts with a vibrant and charming feeling. The pacing of the film seems alright from start to finish with no bumps. The way the elements in this movie flows it feels like this movie has some predecessors and it kinda gets confirmed when things get easily predictable. The direction and screenplay has packed enough punch to make you laugh and emotional from time to time. The story would have been better but even without that this movie emits a beautiful charming vibe that will soothe your mind at one point. Overall it's definitely a movie you can enjoy on the weekend with family. In terms of watching it will be one time for some people and the others can watch it as many times as they want.,Wish Dragon

33,cyberknight,1001 Chinese Nights,7,8 November 2021,"First thing, this is a retelling of the tale ""Aladdin"" (circa 1703). That means it has a lot of elements similar to other adaptations of the tale (spoiler alert!):* The djinn is replaced by the titular wish dragon from the Chinese folklore.* The lamp is replaced by a teapot.* The original text place Aladdin's story in a ""Chinese city,"" while the film is placed... In a Chinese city! Sure, the original used ""Chinese"" as a metaphor for ""far away,"" while this one actually happens in contemporary China (minus the oppressive government.)It also borrows from other sources:* ""The Monkey's Paw"" (published in 1902) sets a magical item which grants three wishes (and most wishes backfire or don't produce the effects as imagined.)* The dragon looks and feels a lot like Mushu, from Disney's ""Mulan"" (1998).The bad:* Lack of consistency: Laws of Physics affect characters differently depending on irrelevant factors, like some villains fall from the top of a building and... nothing happens, they are fine, because they are comic relief, while another character falls from a similar height and, oh my, he's dying, because of drama-needed-insert-here.* Parts of the plot don't make much sense, like, why didn't Li Na's father seek the teapot earlier (he, obviously, thoroughly believed in its existence and powers), or why the teapot stayed lost for a thousand years and, out of nowhere, it's handed by a god (literally) to a Mr. Nobody? Good guys only show up every thousand-and-something years?* The last few minutes feel rushed: the Midas Touch gimmick is nothing short of dumb (even if the villain was a complete moron, what he doesn't seem to be, so it feels completely forced and out of purpose, except, let the villain kill himself, keeping the protagonist's hands clean.)The good:* It has a good balance between drama and humour.* Voice acting (English version) is very good and makes the flaws in the script less annoying.* The side stories are very interesting, fleshing out the characters.All in all, it's a nice film to watch and, in the end, I thanked it for not being a ""Chinese version of [Disney's] Aladdin (1992),"" as many reviewers have (pro)claimed. Personally, I found it way more interesting than ""Aladdin"" (that was an awful waste of Robin Williams' acting talent.)",Wish Dragon

35,andrewtisler,"Sony Pictures Animation's version of Disney's ""Aladdin"", but with a smart, well-subverted twist and stylish animation",10,10 November 2021,"This year, Sony Pictures Animation has been releasing three animated movies on Netflix in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Wish Dragon"" is one of them. Although Chris Appelhans' first animated feature film contains some similarities to ""Aladdin"", it also surprisingly subverts a lot of these similarities to be unique, especially with the story being about a teenage college student named Din wanting to reunite with his childhood friend Li Na Wang. I also love how we learn the dragon Long was once a human emperor from long ago, thus separating him from ""Aladdin""'s Genie. The humor is quirky and full of gags, and Din and Li Na's relationship is so sweet. The animation is also great too. Very stylish and crafty.""Wish Dragon"" is honestly a very fun animated feature from SPA, even if it's a tad similar to ""Aladdin"" with some of its storytelling. Definite recommend!",Wish Dragon

The characters are quite relatable, and Din is a wonderful role model for anybody and everybody. I quite liked the beginning, they connected the dots quite well.Is it similar to Aladdin? Short answer, yes. Long answer, not really. It has its differences and the best part is here the protagonist isn't a thief (and all the other things we choose to ignore - liar, manipulative, etc.) The movie is filled with moments that make you stop and smile. And it's great to see a different culture.",Wish Dragon
39,h-62007-26888,"Yes, it's an Aladdin ripoff",6,19 July 2021,"But does that make this garbage? Well, it certainly ain't good, but it didn't do enough to make me cringe, so that's a blessing in itself.The film is about an amatuer poor boy named Din, who lives in modern day Shanghai in the poor homes. After coming across a magic teapot that contains a wish dragon, he and the dragon are on a personal mission to fulfill their destinies and the boy to win the heart of the girl. When people look at this story, many suspect that this is a ripoff of Aladdin, as it does have a similar plot structure to that story. However, since the folk tale is speculated to have originated from China, this could be considered as an Aladdin adaptation more than a copycat. But does that mean calling it a ripoff is inaccurate? NO. In fact, this film copies SEVERAL plot elements from the original source material shamelessly. Think about it. The guy with a crush on the rich girl. He finds a guardians who can grant him three wishes. There's also villains who want control of the teapot that try to kill the boy to get it. The girl has feelings for the boy before discovering he was lying about his identity. And more. Before you ask, no. I did NOT come into this movie trying to search for these similarities. I tried as HARD as I could to look at this as its own thing instead of a copycat of someone else. But these similarities are so noticeable that it's just MIND-BLOWING how an executive would think that this script was passable! Anyhow, there are good things this story did that make it work. For one, it does have some solid pacing, moving quickly to make sure it can effectively get out as much as possible in such a short running time, on top of also having some surprisingly effective action scenes in order to help elevate the intensity. Also, the heart is in the right place, especially when Din (Aladdin) wants to get together with Li Na (Jasmine) in order to reconnect with his childhood friend after years apart. So there is a touching side to things despite the lack of originality.In general, I'll admit that what Sony did with the animation is pretty good. It's kind of like what Sony is known for doing mixed with a hint of a Dreamworks style, but it does look good and does use rubberhose effectively for playful moments. On top of that, I'll give credit to the scenes with Long that do look very nice, playing a lot with colors and giving full life onto the effects and his moments whenever they would occur. It's kind of like what they did with Soul but otherwise with a more pink color nature instead of a turquoise-blue mix. Nonetheless, even if it does have generic backgrounds and the style can feel more like it's taken off of Aladdin, but the animation still does a good job on its own.Another credit I'll give this movie is the voice acting. At least for the most part. In general, most of them did fine like Jimmy Wong, Will Yun Lee, Natasha Liu Bordizzo, Aaron Yoo, and John Cho. They do try their best with the materials they were given and it is nice that the film does have an all asian voice cast. Despite this, the others are clearly problematic. Some I guess are trying but are also having problems with the microphone quality, and others clearly needed TRAINING to be better. That and there's also Constanance Wu who I guess is not used to being in a recording studio.Conclusion? Story that copies from Aladdin + terrible comedy + very nice animation + meh voice acting + China + a teapot + Sony Pictures Animation + Netflix = Wish Dragon.",Wish Dragon

42,JoelAlexanderr,The Aladdin remake that the world didn't realize it needed,9,28 June 2021,"WISH DRAGON is the Aladdin remake that Disney wishes they had made instead of their mediocre live-action film. Even though it contains a plot we've all seen before, this movie brings a fresh perspective to the same story and provides a hilariously grounded look at wealth in modern-day society.This is a very simple animated movie -- it never tries to be a groundbreaking piece of cinema -- yet what it does with the material at hand far outstrips any expectations. It updates practically every aspect of the classic Aladdin story for the better: the characters are more fleshed out and are easier to empathize with, the dragon (the genie in Aladdin) isn't the only memorable character, the romance is believable because the two have a history together, etc. However, my favorite update is how they adapt the story to fit into modern-day Asia, including Chinese culture and the class divides that come with our world today. The characters are reflective of people that permeate day-to-day life and the struggles are universal, which makes it a movie any kid and their parent can watch and find meaning in.Most importantly, WISH DRAGON is hilarious throughout. Each character brings their own level of comedy and heart to the movie as a whole, and the film never disappoints at bringing immense joy to any viewer. Obviously, the dragon (voiced by John Cho) is the funniest part of the movie, but the entire narrative has wit injected into it that doesn't go away even when the dragon is not onscreen. This film may seem derivative or trite to some, but I think that it delivers one of the more enjoyable animated experiences of the year, which is saying a lot given the tough competition it has so far (Raya and the Last Dragon, The Mitchells vs. The Machines, Luca). 2021 is an amazing year so far for animated film, and I cannot wait to see what comes next!

45,julianmarku,A good wish story but not a better than Aladdin story,7,20 June 2021,"Let's get this clear, I am not Asian, so cut me some slack that I don't understand how harsh the social norms and inequality is these days. But I do know inequality and the unfairness of the world.And for this movie, it is honestly a very weak version of Aladdin. By the end of it you can forget everything by tomorrow.Here is a question: how does Li Na's unnamed father know about the pot? It was supposedly carried by a god for at least 100 years. How would he know where it is or what it looks like? Outsmart a god?Li Na's father is losing the company? Really? Why did you have all those events? Why don't we see the staff leaving and laughing at him? Why not sell the house? (Maybe if I was Chinese I would understand why that is not possible but your movie is 100% English with American Actors. You're not exactly trying to tell anyone about China)This movie has a good background artists. Most imagery in the background shows you the inequality of society with if you're rich you get an empty house that could fit 100 and if you're poor you live in a small apartment building full of 100 people. Now THAT WOULD be a good message IF the people living in that house actually showed ignorance and pride or joy of living in such luxury. But the very first thing they do is show that the girl hates all the wealth and presents... like you would ever see that from a movie trying to say something about inequality and social messaging.My point is: This movie is so vanilla about the story or messages that it can't do anything memorable. It doesn't commit to anything really.Lastly, the ending doesn't pay off at all. Let me tell you about it: So it is suddenly revealed that Din's mother is a great chef and what do they do with it? They start a famous chain of dumpling food! Now I assume that the Li Na's father sold everything he had left and invested in it. The conclusion: Din is still delivering food, Li Na is now a restaurant organizer, her father is still running the bussiness and his mother is now head chef to a student or something. All those other character you see in the building are no where to be see. The conclusion is: money changes lives, poverty is an easily solvable problem as long as you know the right people to invest in you...I may be harsh about this movie but it kept flinging this message of : ""wealth is not everything"" only to spin around and say: ""Okay gold is not everything, it's how you invest in it.""",Wish Dragon

The animation quality and visuals are very very good compared to disney movies from 2018 and 19. But wasn't promoted in the US and Netflix at all. Like is it a form of racism or what?I love the movie with such an awesome message and focus on the beauty of friendship and family. The beautiful depiction of childhood friendship and hardship of a poor family. It sums up the Asian lifestyle pretty well. The movie also focuses on the beauty of community and love in-between them even the jokes about neighbors being nosy was hilarious.The animation and visuals were the best I've seen in a while. The quick frames and movement of objects are astonishing and quite amazing. I love the visually pleasing bits like smoke and sparkles glittery glows at different times.

Also, it taught a bit of a different lesson than most kids films.My only complaints would be that some moments were a bit predictable and the animation could've had a bit more detail, not to mention in a few scenes the lip syncing was a bit off.But at the end of the day, it's a nice family movie that your kids will love.

The animation was terrific but everything that happens is totally giving me Aladdin vibes even when I watched the trailer and the movie itself. First is the characters, come on we got the main character who is ( Aladdin) then the girl who is his best friend ( Jasmine) the dragon who grants wishes ( The genie ). The bad guy ( Jafar) who is literally trying to steal the tea pot ( Lamb). Soo many similarities just a matter of time before this movie will be know as, "" Hugest rip off of Aladdin.""

62,karolinecelis,How do you want to be remembered? Not bad animated film,7,12 June 2021,"When I first watch this animated film with my dad. I recognize some things as an adult and most adults would notice. Funny thing is the creator of these characters, the story, and ideas exposes what adults, and older people doesn't want us to know. You know money and materialism won't make you happy. If it does good for you, however it won't make you a better person especially acting rebellious, or having an attitude you'll feel disappointed, and unhappy trust me. I am turning 23 this year and no matter if you're materialistic or not people has something to feel about. If you stole something or took without permission don't blame yourself harshly, and learn your lesson. No matter if you don't or not there's much more to life.The reason why I titled, 'How do you want to be remembered?'. While watching the film it made me recall watching a YouTuber's video he goes by Ali Abdaal he talks about how you want to be remembered. Here's the point. How does everyone want to be remembered? No complaining and negativity allowed. For me I wanna be remembered and tell this to my future family, ""Take care of yourself first before you take care of anyone else or you let anyone into your life."" To keep it short, life is short and pain is temporary they come and go. Because no matter what you're going through be there for yourself, and people who cares about you.The film is not too bad I won't rate it highly. At first thought it was an average animated film, and I have fascination for fantasy, animation, and reminded me bit of Mulan, and Disney's Aladdin. As Asian American I recognize some funny and relatable things Asian parents would say. And to be clear I am not Chinese I am Filipino, so some of the things I may not relate with.Until later in the animated series I didn't see it coming. The girls father almost fell to his death, and consequence of the man who was fighting the main character. Not to mention everything about greed and evil the root of materialism, and money. In real life there's still evil in this world, and people who cares too much about money. We need money to afford anything when it gets out of hand becomes problematic, and we all know when it comes to handling money, and materialism it needs to taken under control not let it control you.The main characters wishes weren't great, and was selfish of him, and feels unhappy. Because he rarely understood his childhood friend. Why doesn't he consider listening to her? This is annoying because in real life relationships aren't easy to handle. To be in a relationship you need to take care of yourself. Because narcissism and acting narcissistic towards others.If this animated series were to end. It could have ended when the main character let's the man who was king of royal pass, or free him, and destroy the magic/wish tea brewer.Some solutions the main character could've done is listen, and understand the experience of what it's like living as wealthy person, or son or daughter of family which became wealthy. So what caught my attention and made me remember the video I watch on YouTube regarding Disney Pixar doesn't want children, and kids to watch only animated movie about soul music, and the history of soul music, and so on and so forth. He explains Disney has problem with exploiting topics kids, and children shouldn't know, and I understand why. Because adults and the older people doesn't want the younger people, and generation to know why we are alive on earth, and why our purpose in life doesn't align with your spark, and future dream job, and so on and so forth.I am unsure if the creator of this film are going to keep doing the same as the creators of Disney Pixar soul. Because of the issue with exploiting and in censoring topics, and children, and younger people should know. I am also spiritual person after watching this. First of all our spirits have reasons why we humans are alive on earth there's many reason, and one reason is to create a reality, and move humanity or the world forward. Also, please don't come at me I am no expert in spirituality I am combination of beginner, and intermediate.When we humans leave this world and die. How do you want to be remembered? Life is short no matter what you have, and no matter the pain you're going through pain is temporary, and they come and go. Don't take out your pain onto others because you're in pain or feel stressed.Overall, this animated film not too bad. If it were any better the main character needs to recognize what he's doing to himself, and how he's behaving towards himself. Because this took me a long time to figure things out. Psychologically your behavior towards yourself is a reflection of how you you behave towards everyone, and affects all relationships. And stop lying to yourself. Because I learned our subconscious don't lie because there's no humor, and our spirits know better many celebrities discussed about law of attraction, and lying to your subconscious regarding your dreams you want to come true. So don't only be careful. Listen to your subconscious and spirit. Do not lie to yourself because your subconscious doesn't take any humor, and jokes you make regarding your dreams.Before this gets any long.

72,Shadow2442,What a wonderful movie,10,20 June 2021,"First, this is not Aladin... this is based partly on chinese mythology and represents the gap between poor and rich in China pretty well and how people behave in China, comparing more like what people own and represent instead of their live experience and happiness. Life in China during these times is pretty hard if you are poor and have nothing to show and it's very rare that a couple coming from a poor and rich side, can come together and are ""allowed"" to fall in love. Some wealthy families will not allow here daughter / son to marry someone poor. That's a fact.Back to the movie.... i was very pleasantly surprised of all the work which was put into this, story, characters and of course the special effects... this movie has more spirit (pun!) than most of the Disney stuff of today.Heartful, enjoyable storyline which concentrates on the good in people.

Definitely worth a try.It has a great plot, many funny moments that got us laughing a lot, beautiful characters and character dynamics and wonderful lessons.

It's very funny and made me laugh so hard. Then, I started to watch this whole with my family and found that it has many funny scenes in there. The chemistry between Lin and Tin was so good btw.And the most importantly, I feel related to the Asian culture and values in there, like how neighbors would always want to know about you, the connection making in the business party, and how you should find your lover who has the same rate of income as yours.

I still watched the movie for the sake of it, and I was blown away by how riveting it was and how many tears it made me shed. It has a great, engaging story full of memorable scenes, a couple of plot twists that make your heart drop, and emotional moments that pull on your heart-strings VERY hard! I love many of the jokes and there were several times where I burst out laughing, although the emotion stood out to me a lot more than the humor did. The film's entire storyline is a joy to venture through, and you gradually learn more about the characters as it goes on--There's more to them than what meets the eye. I don't think the trailers do this film justice whatsoever. Prepare yourself for an entertaining tale about true friendship, family, and the sacrifices you're willing to make for those you love.The only complaint I have with this movie is that many of the backgrounds appear dull and bland. I noticed this when I just watched the trailers as well. But the characters are lively and nicely animated at least.",Wish Dragon

Well, the only reason why they say this movie is an Aladdin rip-off because of the plots being the same and copied everything. But for me, this movie is pure amazing and a blast! I saw that 3:09 am in the morning when it came out and I was surprised! Not only that, but the plot sure has a lot of detail and action into it. And learning to be realistic is the important lesson.The movie has the perfect protagonist and antagonist also. Ever since I watched Aladdin when I was a kid, it was so inspiring for three wishes. So, I don't think this is an Aladdin ripoff at all, which means it's a modern-day version of a Chinese fairy tale.It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, you are who you are. Money like between those two words are not important. What's important is believing in your heart and yourself top the whole world.

119,RubyMowzRulez,Almost reaches Pixar quality,7,27 June 2021,"This film was certainly better than I anticipated (granted, I did not expect much) and had some genuinely touching moments and strong character arcs throughout, but certain other elements such as the villain and how many elements I've seen in stronger movies let it down.While it does use many of the clichés and tropes Aladdin uses, it often subverts many of them at the same time, or explores sides of the idea of having wishes in ways Aladdin doesn't. Not all of these ideas land or fully work, but it certainly makes it feel mostly like a totally different film. The main characters are genuinely likeable and well voice acted, with clear and believable arcs throughout.On the other hand, it fires off gags and jokes pretty often and while they usually aren't awful jokes, there's only a handful of really funny ones. Combine this with the cartoonish villain but more realistic main characters and storyline and it feels like a mashup in tone of a Pixar movie and a very average Dreamworks film.Still, even the rather pointless villain shows some interesting creativity in the way he moves and fights, so even the parts that don't work glimmer with flashes of brilliance.You'll probably never watch this more than once, but I think it gets a lot right and was so close to greatness and dripping with little things to like it's worth that one watch if you are into animated movies.",Wish Dragon

The main character is literally named 'Din', after Alladin, Din is't even a Chinese name.And second of all: why is nobody talking about how the movie adresses the gap between poor and rich and the fast developing Chinese society (namely Shanghai)? Not only that, but also about how the Chinese society is nowadays all about money and material?This movie has so many depths, but most people will never know this, because they don't know China.

123,raenier_r,"It's kinda like Aladdin, but not really",7,30 September 2021,"Yes, the movie follows the premise of Aladdin, a poor boy pretending to be rich to get a chance to meet with a rich girl, and a bad man who's been a servant all his life trying to use the wishes for nefarious deeds, but that's where the similarities end. The movie presents real life problems (like poverty, money, debt, business failure, loneliness) albeit in a more light-hearted and child friendly way, but it also presents the good sides of life (love, family, compassion).Sure, the movie does leave some ends unresolved (Why present MC as a smart guy when he acts like an idiot for most of the movie? Couldn't they have utilized his supposed intelligence more, even in the ending? Long is basically magic, so why did he allow himself to turn fully into gold? The god speaks of learning compassion, yet refuses to let Long back to save a friend unless he redoes his punishment, yep very compassionate. Etc etc), but the way it presents the values of family and love really hits home (which may depend on how close you are to your family, to which I'm fortunate enough to be really close). And I'm not gonna act like the scenes with his mother don't hit really close to home and didn't make me tear up a bit.Is it a flawless movie? No. Is it like Aladdin? A bit yeah. Will this movie be a timeless classic? Probably not. But is it good? Yes, and that's what's really important.",Wish Dragon

In the spirit world, the dragon now a human, begs to be turned into a dragon to grant the boys final wish. Back to the earth, he is turned into a dragon again and grants the boys final wish and returns to the spirit world. But this isn't the end of the story, the dragon goes back to earth to serve 10 more masters again. He probably wanted to keep doing it infinitely.

These are completely different characters that are more relatable than street rat and sultans daughter. The villain isn't some Wiseman magician with a parrot, and the female lead's father isn't a doting sultan but is instead a busy man that hasn't the time for his daughter because he wants to make a future for her. The only true similarity is the 3 wishes and the jade teapot which could be replaced by a lamp in Aladin and that the wish dragon like genie assumes the only thing someone would want is wealth. This movie is not just a boy winning a girl's heart, but a moral journey that teaches that there are more important things than wealth. It is more wholesome of a story and if people only look past the similarities between this an Aladin, they might actually like this more. Sure there aren't any snazzy songs and dances, and yes, it has its similarities, but even if this were just Aladin retold, it is done tastefully artistically and has more wholesome value. Every character is likeable, the context and characters are more relatable, the visuals are stunning and the messages are beautiful. (Yes, im aware this a moderately unorganized review)",Wish Dragon

However i noticed towards the end of the story the movie began to slip away from it's main focus. The movie was meant to focus on the lost friendship between Din and Lina, however, after very little screen time together, Lina discovered who Din really was. That was sort of it for the focus of their friendship. The movie switched focus from Din and Lina to Din and Long. It was implied that their friendship was restored at the end but you never actually see Lina get emotionally attached back to Din. It felt like their friendship was forced back together solely because the father's company died. I wasn't expecting the two to fall in love with each other.

Take West Side Story and Baz Lurhmann's version of Romeo and Juliet as examples. Both are well appreciated and studied media set in more modern times, yet inspired by the same source.I watched this movie without any expectations, with my interest soley due to its modern asian setting.

I know that some cultures do this more than others, but corporal punishment is frowned upon where I live, and I found it very off-putting, especially in a movie aimed at kids.",Wish Dragon

150,mhencan,Poor copy of Aladdin,3,1 July 2021,"Just seems like everything the Chinese do, copy someone else's great work and try to make it theirs. I am also kind of amazed that Sony would support this project but I guess like the rest of Hollywood they just care about making money from the Chinese market.",Wish Dragon
151,angelaonyin,Too much like Aladdin,5,19 June 2021,"The story is not bad, but it is too similar to ""Aladdin""............. It's just a fusion of Chinese elements.Mom and neighbors are very cute, I like them.",Wish Dragon
152,gettygg0040,Chinese Aladdin,1,13 June 2021,Literally the same thing. They copied everything. There's not a single thing original in this movie.,Wish Dragon
153,johanna-de-bellio,Go watch it!,10,16 June 2021,Absolutely loved this movie! I hope it gets the attention it deserves!!,Wish Dragon
154,ediyang,A well executed Aladdin inspired story - Just watch it.,10,12 June 2021,"I was skeptical about this movie being so obviously similar to Aladdin. Whoever watch the trailer of Wish Dragon will immediately think of Aladdin and be like ""now Chinese copying Aladdin. So original"".To be honest, it's really hard to find anything original nowadays. And who cares about originality when they can execute the story very well into something different?It's a simple story about the meaning of life. Another reminder of what truly matters in life. Wealth isn't always the answer but being realistic is important too.I love how they created this character Long Zhu. The dragon is so lovable. It gave me a good impression.I really enjoyed this movie. Everything is predictable but in a good way. Very enjoyable. Watch this with your family and kids.",Wish Dragon
155,rahilshah-138-299413,Beautiful movie!,10,1 July 2021,"If you are looking for meaning in this world where people are just running behind riches and not enjoying the moment or beautiful things which are for free, you will love this movie. Not a copy of Aladdin! I love the concept wish dragon being someone who had to learn things about this world.",Wish Dragon
156,sgfwinters,An entertaining feel-good film,10,18 June 2021,"Think Aladdin based in modern day China, but the genie is a dragon, and the dragon's character is more like Emperor Kuzco than Robin Williams' Genie.Throw in some good old cartoony Kung fu slapstick, engaging running gags, and copious character growth and it's fun for the whole family.",Wish Dragon
157,taitkelly,BLOODY BRILLIANT,10,15 August 2021,"My 9month old baby boy absolutely adores this movie! Great watch, lovely story line and great sense of humour I loved it!",Wish Dragon
158,hishamkhan-89784,Most funny and epic movie of 2021,9,15 August 2021,My 7 and 6 years old kids love this movie so much that they have watched it more than 15 times. They are desperately waiting for the part 2 of this movie.,Wish Dragon
