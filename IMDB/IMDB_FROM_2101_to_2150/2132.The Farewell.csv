0,SnoopyStyle,the big lie,8,30 March 2021,"Billi (Awkwafina) is a 30 year old pianist in New York City. She's struggling after being rejected for a scholarship. She and her parents moved to America when she was young. She is mostly Americanized. News come that her grandmother is dying of cancer. Her family agrees to go the traditional route of hiding the diagnosis from the dying grandma. They are going home to China to fake a wedding celebration. Billi is reluctant to go with the lie.This is a great cultural story. It's the Chinese culture but also the influence of Western culture. It's a family story. It's also Awkwafina's best acting performance yet. Her inner conflict and her family conflict are both very compelling. There are funny little insights. It's a very touching film. I would modify the ending a little. Looking back at Nai Nai as they drive away is such a powerful scene. The movie should probably end there. The scream is not a good way to end especially with the text reveal in the closing credits. If they want to go back to Billi for the ending, it should be something more positive considering what Nai Nai tells her during the banquet.",The Farewell
1,boblipton,Family Is Where The Heart Is,8,18 August 2019,"Shuzhen Zhao's hospital report says she has terminal cancer. She has perhaps four months to live. They don't tell her. Instead, the family rushes the marriage of Awkafina's cousin so that they can gather with one one last time, without letting her know anything is wrong.It's been many years since a good friend insisted I look at Ang Lee's THE WEDDING BANQUET and EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN one after the other. When they were done, he said ""Well?"" and I said ""They're so Jewish!"" With his comedies of manners about an emigrant culture that sustains itself willy-nilly, rejected by and rejecting the mainstream, both groups are similar in their reliance on family and the dinner table as a means of staying together. Writer-director Lulu Wang's movie is of a piece with these two, with some very entertaining performances, and insight into what family means to people who are forced to be apart.",The Farewell
2,Horst_In_Translation,"It did not turn out as emotional for me as I hoped it would, but still a pretty good movie",6,26 December 2019,"""The Farewell"" is an American/Chinese co-production from 2019, so a pretty new movie and fittingly with the countries that it is from it is also a healthy mix of English and Mandarin language from beginning to end of these 100 minutes. The writer and director is Lulu Wang. She has a made a handful short films and this is her second full feature movie and definitely her biggest success so far. This film has really achieved a great deal of awards recognition and most notably this includes Golden Globe nominations in the Foreign Language category as well as a nomination for lead actress Awkwafina. But there is definitely a lot more. I wonder if this film can get in at the Oscars too and the best bet is perhaps the screenplay. Can't really see Awkwafina getting in, even if she was considered a frontrunner earlier this year, but we will see. Foreign language it was not picked by China, so no chance there. Now as for the film itself. I mentioned Awkwafina already and her character is at the center of it all as she plays a woman in her 20s who goes back to China for a while as her family visits her grandmother there and the old lady is terminally ill, but doesn't know about it, so they create a fake wedding in order to have everybody unite around the old woman again that they all can see her one last time. So to watch these characters pretend there is an actual wedding makes for some awkwardly funny moments, but at the same time with this background it is of course also a sad film, even if like I said in the title it did not touch me as much as I hoped it would. I want to talk a little bit more about the comedy though. A definite contender for funniest scene of the film is included in the trailer already (unfortunately, yes there can be spoilers like this too that don't take away any of the film's action) and I am talking about the moment when the grandmother says something to herself or a friend about the soon-to-be spouses how they (do not) get along in the bedroom when she is not there because they seem to be pretty clumsy. There are other funny moments like for example also a scene that has Awkwafina and her character's father sing a famous Fugees song and then in the next scene we hear the most traditional song ever performed by the two who will marry soon. This scene also really illustrated nicely the contrast between modern USA and traditional China, which is referenced here several times, also when we hear an explanation about how it depends where you are from if your life belongs to yourself or to your family.I want to mention the music specifically. I really liked the soundtrack, such as the tune that gets repeated several times during the film (it's pretty simple, a bit funny, but also melancholic like the movie itself), but also at the end we get a decent cover version of a song by my beloved Leonard Cohen and the song used during the closing credits was pretty nice too. I thought this one fit in very well too with the tone of the movie overall. As for Awkwafina, I am curious how far she can go this awards season. Mentioned that earlier already. I must say I don't like her music at all, but she played her part well all in all. Still even if she made the character her own, I thought something was really missing for me that I could say the awards recognition is justified. The actress who plays the grandmother, Shuzhen Zhao, was at least as good and I liked her portrayal and it is even more impressive because she has not acted in film before it seems despite her age. But really the entire cast was good down to those who don't have too much screen time. For example I also quite liked the father of Awkwafina's character. They were all good. There is also another scene with him and his brother and Billi that stayed in the mind for me, namely when she catches him smoking and the brother reacts like she should not tell her father what to do (which would be the traditional Chinese approach), but these character are really Americanized already considerably because they have lived there for like 20 years. Another scene I struggled with a bit during my screening was the one when we have Billi tell her mother that she wants to stay in China. I thought this was unrealistic and came out of nowhere, but really the more I think about it the more it does make sense. She has no boyfriend (even if she has friends as we see briefly on one occasion), her application was declined and she wants to spend as much time as possible with her grandmother before she passes. So thumbs-up for this scene I say now. This film never really was about the question if the old lady could survive or not, for me at least. It was much more about the question if the old lady knew she was sick. I mean she is clearly smart, seems to be a good observer when it comes to both her family, but also her own body we should not forget that. Sometimes it feels as if it was not just her family playing a role, but also her playing along and both sides could not talk about it, but the truth is she knew she was dying, or at least that she was really sick. I will just mention two moments that made me think so, namely the one when she says goodbye to Billi near the end and as we see her there with so many tears in her eyes, this was the most touching moment of the film for me. So sad. There I guessed she really knew what was going on. The second moment, much lighter, was earlier when they visit her late husband's grave and the old lady says many many prayers there and the words sounded funny no denying because of the language and how often she said it and also how one character complained about physical issues from the bowing down, but I also felt she wanted to get it all off her chest now that she still has the chance.Writer and director Lulu Wang made this film based on her own family. She is the real Awkwafina you could say, or ""the real Billi"" is more accurate. ""Based on an actual lie"" or so was what it told us right at the beginning, so we can be glad Wang has filmmaking and writing talent to put her story on the screen here luckily. And the real ending was a happy one because the old lady this is about, in real life Wang's grandmother, is still alive 6 years after her diagnosis. A little miracle that will get you in a bit of a better spirit again, even if you don't know if the same is going to happen to the character in the film. But yeah it did surprise me a bit as like I said earlier, the film in my opinion never really questioned that she was going to die. And maybe this way it is another reason why they should not have told her, so she would live her life to the fullest and not be depressed in the face of her dying rather sooner than later because that is now how things went it seems. There was just this one moment when they said something like cancer always means death in China, namely death from sadness. So I thought perhaps it does not have to mean 100% death from the illness itself. But maybe I am just grasping at straws now I don't know. All in all, I want to say that I did like this movie, even if I hoped it could still be a little better, but there are many nice culture clash moments that feel really very witty and authentic nonetheless and I think given the fact that Wang is not really a very experienced filmmaker the outcome here is pretty impressive. It is a film that will make you smile a lot (the groom was hilarious too with his face expressions how he really could not hide that he could not deal with the situation), make you sad occasionally and this is also thanks to the cast ensemble that should be getting way more (awards) attention. 2019 is a really strong year for Asian movies. Everybody is talking about Parasite of course, but it is not just high-quality films from Korea or Japan being released when it comes to this particular continent. I have seen at least two other Chinese films this year already and they are also pretty good. This one here sets the bar really high. I think you should check it out. It's a good watch on your own, with your family, with your significant other etc. because the film just offers so many facets that no matter how you are seeing it, it will always be a success. As long as you see it. Do not miss out. I was occasionally close to giving it an even higher rating, but in the end it is just a good, not a great film I'd say.",The Farewell
3,lee_eisenberg,all families should get understood,10,3 January 2020,"Among the most interesting movies that I've seen are ones focusing on families from a culture unlike my own. ""The Farewell"" is a perfect example. Lulu Wang's movie focuses on a young New Yorker of Chinese descent (Awkwafina) who goes to Changchun to visit her dying grandmother. The contrast of US attitudes towards cancer and Chinese attitudes towards it provides much of the context, but there's also the look at the family gathering amid China's continued development.The movie manages the right balance of humor and pathos in depicting the bittersweet reunion. Having turned in comic performances in ""Ocean's 8"" and ""Crazy Rich Asians"", Awkwafina shows her dramatic side here. It's definitely one that you should see.PS: Tzi Ma, who plays her father, played one of the group members in ""The Ladykillers"" and the general in ""Arrival"".",The Farewell
4,jboothmillard,The Farewell,7,7 October 2019,"It was after this was chosen a couple of times as ""Film of the Week"" on BBC News - The Film Review, by Mark Kermode and others, so I looked into it, it definitely sounded like something worthwhile. Basically, aspiring Chinese-American writer Billi (Awkwafina) has a close relationship with Nai Nai (Shuzhen Zhao), her grandmother. Nai Nai (meaning 'paternal grandmother' in Mandarin) lives in Changchun, China, they maintain their relationship communicating online. Billi has recently received a rejection letter for a Guggenheim Fellowship, then discovers from her parents, Haiyan (Dante's Peak star Tzi Ma) and Jian (Diana Lin), that her grandmother has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and may have only a few months left to live. Through deception and manipulation of medical test results, the family decide to keep Nai Nai's diagnosis a secret from her. Billi is against the decision, but the family reason that they would rather she lived in good spirits, and not in fear. The family instead tell her a ""good lie"", that her recent doctor visits have only revealed benign findings. Hao Hao (Han Chen), Billi's cousin from Japan is getting married in China, this serves as an excuse to unite the family to spend what is expected to be one last time with Nai Nai. Haiyan and Jian fear Billi will expose the lie to her grandmother and tell her to remain in New York City. Shortly after the rest of the family have arrived, Billi, having disobeyed her parents' orders, also arrives Changchun. Billi assures her parents that she will not reveal the cancer diagnosis to Nai Nai. Throughout the trip, however, she clashes with the rest of the family, including the doctor treating her grandmother, over their deliberate dishonesty towards her grandmother. Billi feels guilty and conflicted about the decision of her parents, but Chinese cultural beliefs go against disclosing such a life-threatening disease with the matriarch. One night, Uncle Haibin (Yongbo Jiang) says that lie allows the family to bear the emotional burden of the diagnosis, rather than Nai Nai herself, and acknowledges this differs from values common in Western culture. Billi later learns that Nai Nai also did the same thing for her husband, he was terminally ill and never told him before his death. On the day of the wedding, Haibin and Hao Hao both break down in tears on separate occasions but Nai Nai's suspicions are not raised and they manage to proceed through the rest of the banquet. That night, Nai Nai gives Billi a hóngbao (a red envelope containing money as a gift), encouraging her to spend the money as she chooses. Billi reveals to her grandmother about the Guggenheim Fellowship rejection, and Nai Nai responds by encouraging Billi to continue following her dreams. Billi keeps her promise to maintain the lie and shares a tearful goodbye with Nai Nai, as the rest of the visiting family members return to their homes in Japan and America. The end credits reveal that the real woman Nai Nai was based on is still alive, six years after her diagnosis. Also starring Hong Lu as Little Nai Nai, Aoi Mizuhara as Aiko, Hao Hao's girlfriend/fiancée, Li Xiang as Aunty Lin and Hong Lin as Doctor Wu. Awkwafina gives a terrific performance as the young woman struggling to keep the big secret that everyone says is for the best, all the actors give good performances also, but it is definitely Zhao who shines as the kind old lady who speaks no English and maintains a positive attitude with no idea of her terrible condition. There are two sides to the argument of a diagnosis as featured in this film: most people would want to know if they are dying, but the other side is that the person would remain positive without knowing. This subject is handled very well, the nearest and dearest gathering and staying close works well, you can enjoy their gatherings also to see the tasty selection of foods they eat together, and tragic element is lightened along the way with some humour, an interesting and worthwhile drama. Very good!",The Farewell
5,Quinoa1984,"the lies we tell others, and the lies we tell ourselves - beautiful film",10,29 July 2019,"It can be argued, as I will, that, wherever Shuzhen Zhao came from (it is her *only* screen credit to date), she delivers one of the sweetest, warmest, most equally profoundly and simply human performances this decade. Holy moly! I don't care whether she was a professional actor before this or not, she gave me all the feelings.Lulu Wang's film explores how this family, this culture in China and the East, have to be deceiving when it comes to not delivering the news of a fatal diagnosis (as someone says here, it isn't the cancer they think kills, it's the *fear* that is connected with it), and at the same time it explores how we lie all the time in small ways. Lies in family can be tricky; if you're married to someone, lying to them is wrong, or at least should be seen that way. But little lies to a parent or grandparent (for example, ""Are you alright?"" ""I'm fine"" or ""Did you get the news about the Fellowship?"" ""Still waiting"" or ""Do you need money?"" ""I'm fine"" or this or that here). those don't seem to matter so much, since it's more about protecting oneself. It may be a selfish act, but more often than not we as people have to balance how much or how little we say when keeping bits and pieces of information (even, especially even, when it's about our well-being) from those who may, oh I don't know, worry a bit more.In other words, we're all kind of messed up in that way, and at the same time it's seen as something acceptable - hell, sometimes we can just tell when a family member isn't being truthful, but why say anything about it. Indeed early on here, with this story being about how the family of a Matriarch Nai Nai (Zhou) come together for what on the surface is a wedding but is really not deeply felt and is actually about them coming together for a long goodbye as Nai Nai has been diagnosed with terminal cancer (even the doctors don't tell her, or if they might, the family intercepts the info to not tell her), I wondered if Wang might go in the direction that Nai Nai *knows* that she is dying, but is putting on a kind and brave face since that's just how she is. But then she says one thing to Billie (Awkwafina) about seeing her marry one day, and it becomes clear she truly doesn't know.What's the saying though, ignorance is bliss? One of the major strengths of this film is that it is deeply philosophical about life and death - I spent a lot of time during and after watching the film thinking about if I would want to know if I was terminally ill, or if I would tell someone close to me like my own mother, or visa-versa - while at the same time being a very warm and inviting film. This isn't a film about how the end of one's life impacts those around that person like, say, Michael Haneke's Amour; this isn't something where you feel the filmmaker being so rigorous that, regardless of quality, once it's done you never want to go near it again. The ideas expressed here are largely anchored around Zhou's performance who, I must say this again, is a total dear, but at the same time isn't someone exactly depicted as naive, she has an emotional intelligence that carries so much, and makes one think about (if one has them) of those times an elder in a family brought people together (a key point, and this is a minor spoiler but it's OK I think to share - she had to do something similar of this lie to *her husband*, so she knows the tradition herself).If anything, the tenor of this movie reminded me a lot of Yasujiro Ozu's work. Not so much in the direction of compositions, as I think Wang is a bit less formal in style (there's one part that even made me think of Wes Anderson), but in the writing and acting it's there, the subject matter and how the parts move along. Or, let me be more specific, it's like if we had a new Ozu, but it was more from the POV of someone who, via Billi (who is playing a version of Lulu Wang), is and isn't of the culture, so the conflict is the main one but it's also there in family dynamics. What isn't said is as important as what is, maybe more-so (that scene at *dinner, where what's expected of one's life is brought up and rolled about), and in nearly every beat we we wonder if Billi might break and just SAY it (or, at one key point, the groom at the wedding).The emotions that comes from these conflicts and the questions of how to live one's life and face a death and if we are connected to the rest of the world... it never feels forced upon us because it a) comes from being gentle with the observations, and b) Wang finds a perfect balance with sweet humor and achingly raw pathos. There may be one or two points that don't so much not work but feel familiar - a panic run Billi has near the end to stop something from happening, and a song as they leave that does feel sentimental - but I don't care. This is a great, great film about so many things, and if nothing else it's about having someone you love in your life and what that responsibility, cancer or not, entails. It's intimately and at times painfully connected to the troubles of the human condition, and (not but, and) it does so with things like a father and daughter at the wedding doing karaoke to The Fugees ""Killing Me Softly"".One more time, give Shuzhen Zhou a round of applause, or just a giant hug!",The Farewell
6,tavm,The Farewell is a fine slice-of-life drama about a sensitive subject,8,22 April 2020,"Having previously appeared in the very popular Crazy Rich Asians, Awkwafina then starred in this Lulu Wang film about a young adult woman who decides to visit her grandmother in China after finding out from her immediate family about her having only a few months to live. That family decides to not tell the matriarch, honoring Chinese tradition which Awkwafina disagrees with. I'll just now say this is not a heavy drama, just a matter-of-fact telling about something that happened with Ms. Wang's family. Awkwafina herself handles the drama concerning her character compellingly and deserved her Golden Globe award. This film certainly got my own mom-who's Filipino-to reveal that her own sisters ended up never telling their own mother about her condition before her untimely death. Makes me wonder how different families from various cultures handles such sensitive revelations...",The Farewell
7,BandSAboutMovies,Emotional,7,17 March 2020,"Turns out award shows can have a positive result on my movie watching. I wouldn't have known anything about this film if Awkwafina hadn't won the Best Actress - Musical or Comedy Golden Globe for her work here.Luckily, the movie lived up to my expectations and then some.Based on director Lulu Wang's real life - which she first publicly discussed on an episode of This American Life - The Farewell proves that the foreign may not be so foreign. Billi (Awkwafina) learns that her grandmother Nai Nai (played by Chinese theatrical actress Shuzhen Zhao) is dying from cancer, yet her family refuses to tell their matriarch. Instead, an elaborate wedding ruse is invented so that they may all see her one more time.The truth is, six years after the real life diagnosis, Wang's grandmother remains alive. She still didn't know that she even had the disease until this movie. Incredibly, Wang kept the secret from her during and after the making of this movie. She would only discover the true story when she discussed the movie with her sister Lu Hong, who plays herself in the movie. The fact that the movie was released in China as Don't Tell Her was not lost on the real life Nai Nai, who remarked, ""...that's why you didn't tell me, because I am the ""her"" of the Don't Tell Her.""The way that families deal with aging is strange. My father had a stroke last year and often worries so much about the shaking in his hands - which he can't understand and needs an explanation daily - that the rest of my family told him that it was all because one of the knives he uses isn't balanced properly and that the shaking isn't really his fault. Much like the lies in this movie, that simple explanation makes things easier for him. Is it right? I'm not entirely sure.The lesson here comes from Nai Nai's farewell. She warns Billi of being ""the bull endlessly ramming its horns into the corner of the room"" and tells her that ""life isn't just about what you do, it's more about how you do it."" Certainly this seems like no great revelation, but this movie is all about the way the story and the advice and the emotion are told.",The Farewell
8,studioAT,Deserving of hype,3,19 March 2020,"An excellent bittersweet film that was well deserving of the acclaim it received around award season.I can't say I'd rush to watch it again, but it was certainly worth seeing.",The Farewell
9,view_and_review,The Farewell was Well Done,9,13 August 2019,"Billi (Awkwafina) is a mopey young Chinese woman living in New York. Her clothes, her posture, and her face scream, ""I need a hug!"" She gets a shock when she finds out her Nai Nai aka grandmother (Shuzhen Zhao) is dying from cancer and only has three months to live. She's even more shocked to find out that the family is keeping this news hidden from Nai Nai as a means of freeing her from burden. The family claims that Nai Nai's grandson is getting married as a pretext for going to China and being with her one last time.I thought the movie was wonderful. I like cultural movies as it is and this movie was very much about the Chinese culture--or at least one aspect of it. Be forewarned, the majority of the movie is subtitled. I prefer subtitles to English dubbing as it gives the movie a more authentic feel.The very concept of keeping a terminal illness a secret from the one that is ill was fascinating to me. As one of Nai Nai's sons put it: the family was collectively bearing the burden for their matriarch. So, they devised this elaborate beautiful lie in order to conceal the ugly truth. The only bogey was Billi.Billi and her family had been in America for years and weren't necessarily on board with this custom, and Billi was especially torn. The family was desperately afraid that she would give away the secret with her sad face. The family was gathering for a ""wedding"" and a distraught Billi would certainly betray that ruse.In some ways this movie was an East vs. West and at times it was an East merges with West. I found it all beautiful: the story, the characters, the music, and the dialog. The Farewell was well done.",The Farewell
10,evanston_dad,One of the Year's Best So Far,9,6 September 2019,"Awkwafina the comedienne is an acquired taste, one I'm not sure is for me. But I was quite impressed with Awkwafina the dramatic actress, who plays a Chinese woman who's been raised in America but returns to China for a faux wedding. The wedding is just an excuse to get the family together one last time before the death of their mother and grandmother, who isn't told she's dying. This apparently is a common practice in China, the rationale being that since she's going to die anyway, she might as well not know it and live the rest of her short life in ignorant bliss.This idea is really hard for an American to wrap her head around, and I first identified with Awkwafina's character, who struggles with her family's decision to concoct this ruse and their demand that she go along with it. Not only does it seem disrespectful to the person who has a right to know about her medical condition, it's also something that would be illegal in America. But as the movie progresses, what first seems like a no-brainer decision becomes much more complicated, and we start to see the family's point of view. As they see it, keeping the matriarch in the dark is one of the most selfless things they can do, since they're taking on all of the emotional grief and angst for her.The family's secret is the biggest cultural hurdle Awkwafina's character must surmount, but it's not the only one. The movie is about the purgatory immigrants can find themselves living in, not entirely part of either their native or adopted culture. It's a quiet, thoughtful movie, not full of big showy Oscar moments. It's exactly what liberal progressive America is saying we need more of, stories about and featuring people of color, so of course this movie has a tiny audience while something glib and ridiculous like ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is a monster hit.Grade: A",The Farewell
11,ferguson-6,Yay Yah for Nai Nai,8,25 July 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. A twenty-something New York City millennial is having an other-side of-the-globe phone conversation with her Chinese grandmother. It's immediately clear that, despite the geographic gap, these two share a close bond. We also witness the stream of lies each of them cheerfully spouts off within a few minutes. This is the opening scene to writer-director Lulu Wang's semi-autobiographical film ... a film we are warned is ""based on an actual lie.""The millennial is China born and New York raised Billi (Awkwafina). When her parents (Tzi Ma and Diana Lin) tell her that her Grandmother (Nai Nai) has been diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer and has only months to live, Billi is stunned. More shock follows when Billi learns that the family has decided not to inform the family matriarch that she's dying, and even more shock when Billi's parents inform her that they are going to China for a final visit, but Billie is not invited, given her American tendency to wear her emotions on her sleeve.To tell or not to tell? That is the question. If you were terminal, would you want to know? Well evidently in China, that's a question the family can answer on your behalf. Philosophically speaking, is this a cultural or personal question? Your background likely determines your answer. Billi is experiencing a true Yin-Yang ordeal. Is it selfish on her part to want to be able to say goodbye to Nai Nai, or is it selfish on the part of the family to avoid that pressure? We are informed that in China, each person is a part of the whole - the family and the community.Since all of that sounds so ominous and depressing, you should know that the film does a marvelous job of balancing the dramatic with the comical. Laughs are aplenty. The comedy comes from both old and young characters. It's fascinating to see how director Wang explores Chinese family dynamics while also exploring cultural differences - never offering judgment on right and wrong. She often has multiple people in her shots - the frame is typically filled with many faces, making it a challenge for viewers to take in all of the nuances and reactions.With so many characters, it's crucial that we quickly understand the make up of each. That said, the ensemble cast is deep and terrific. The most surprising comes from the hilarious, touching and grounded performance of Shuzhen Zhau as Nai Nai, in what apparently is her first ever on screen appearance. She can be the warm grandmother poking fun at her granddaughter's independent life, or the fully-in-charge woman demanding satisfaction from a local vendor. Her scenes with Billi are the true heart and soul of the film. Awkwafina was fun in CRAZY RICH ASIANS, but here she flashes talent that no one saw coming. It's a textured performance worthy of awards consideration.Despite how personal the story and the characters are to Ms. Wang, her film never dips into sentimental overload or cultural preaching. She also avoids the farcical nature of a film such as DEATH AT A FUNERAL. Instead, she maintains a nice balance between drama and comedy, grief and guilt, and love and respect for tradition. The clichés are lacking, but heart is prevalent. Little wonder this was an Audience Award winner at Sundance. It's a film that's going to touch many.",The Farewell
12,phd_travel,Serious movie not a comedy,6,21 December 2019,Interesting in parts for the insights into Chinese culture and values. This isn't as enjoyable or touching as Joy Luck Club. It won't make you laugh and cry much. This isn't a pretty movie with attractive parts of China and an attractive glam cast. Rather it shows the not terribly attractive industrial town of Changchun. and real looking people and apartments. There are some interesting insights into the Chinese immigrant experience and the East vs West culture differences especially the way the family deals with the illness of their matriarch.Awakfina of Crazy Rich Asians looks very different with a morose expression. Her acting is suitably sad. Grandma acts feisty and well.There is a message about attitude and surviving an illness.Worth a watch but not very enjoyable.,The Farewell
13,siderite,A biographical anecdote about a dying gran,8,17 March 2021,"There is a lot to be unpacked from this film, but you have to be in the mood for it. The details are relevant, but only if you pay attention to them. In the basest of ways, this is a film about family dynamics. The entire family gets together and interact and talk to each other and then the film ends. But it is also about alienation, as so many of the members of the family have found life in other countries, with vastly different cultures and languages and at their deepest, they miss home. It is also about saying farewell to a beloved relative. It is also about cultural clashes. It's also about the whole spectrum of human life.Thankfully, this is an autobiographical movie, so the script is very personal to filmmaker Wang, the plot is carefully crafted, but still everything is rooted in reality. There are no violent melodramas, there are no artificially funny scenes to push boredom away, it's just an honest snapshot of a wedding/farewell party in a Chinese family.Bottom line: I was not in the mood, so I appreciated it much less than it probably deserved. The film is categorized as comedy, drama, but it's not that funny or that dramatic. You will probably connect to it more if you are an expat or have had relatives die of cancer. Very well acted and directed, though.",The Farewell
14,blanbrn,"A secret, a family struggle of emotions like love and pain, it's relative a heartfelt and touching watch.",9,18 August 2019,"""The Farewell"" is one film that as you watch entertains you with thought, and fun laughs and has the drama of pain and emotion all wrapped up in one. It has themes of trust, love, and most of all secrets something that all families can relate to. It involves a Chinese American woman Billi(Awkwafina) who leaves New York City to visit her family and homeland of China and the purpose for this trip is that of a gathering with family as a wedding is about to take place. However this is a wild card and subplot as the real reason is to see the family backbone and leader their grandmother. Grandma has been hit with stage 4 cancer yet she doesn't know it and the family sticks to their country's culture and decide to keep it a secret!The film still entertains with love, laughs, and proves that family and attachment is important this picture is important as many immigrant families can relate to struggle and little things that stick out like Billi doesn't speak the best of Chinese language after being raised in America. Still it proves thru hope, love, and looking the other way from the truth that happiness and emotions can come out in the open for any family.

16,MOscarbradley,Not so much a farewell as a long goodbye...,4,18 September 2020,"A comedy about dying but coming from the Chinese-American director Lulu Wang, less maudlin than it might have been. Nai Nai, (an excellent Shuzhen Zhao), is the Chinese grandmother with only three months to live, so her American family come up with an excuse to fly to China to visit her; they plan a wedding which gives them a reason to celebrate rather than to mourn, (and the wedding itself is superbly done).This is a sweet-natured, sentimental film that still feels like it's strung out way beyond its expiry date and is ultimately redeemed by Zhao's performance. As the granddaughter who wants the family to tell Nai Nai the truth, the much vaunted Awkwafina is so laid back as to be almost horizontal, (she still won a Golden Globe), and yet a lot of people love this film, (maybe they're Chinese and 'get it'). It's at its best when it points up the differences between East and West but that's not enough to make a movie and ultimately this is less ""The Farewell"" as something of a long goodbye.",The Farewell
17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Go and see your grandma.,7,20 September 2019,"'The Farewell (2019)' is proudly based on an actual lie, one told (and apparently maintained to this day) by director Wang's own family. It's perhaps no wonder, then, that the film feels so thoroughly realistic, despite its somewhat outlandish central conceit. It's, essentially, a slice-of-life drama concerning a worldly Chinese family's attempts to grieve in secret, focusing specifically on Chinese-American Billi as she tries her best to conflate her 'westernised' ideas with her family's 'eastern' wishes. This theme is delicately explored and its conclusions are wonderfully accepting, but it sits firmly as the backdrop for the sometimes strained, yet always loving, family dynamics on display. Everything just seems so grounded, with relationships that feel so lifelike you could almost swear they were real. This makes the experience subtle yet stirring. Often, it mirrors everyday life all too closely. The piece isn't always riveting, or ever conventionally exciting, but it's always enjoyable and often emotionally resonant. By its end, it's hard not to have been moved. In fact, you may not realise just how much it has touched you until just before its credits roll. 7/10",The Farewell
18,dromasca,emigration and family melodrama,7,7 March 2020,"I'm not a big fan of melodramas, but there are themes for which the genre of melodrama is very appropriate. In 'The Farewell', written and directed by Lulu Wang we find some of them. It is the director's second feature film, a film about emigration and family, about the cultural differences between the country of origin and the adoptive country and about the confrontation of the second generation of emigrants with this conflict. The distance that emigration creates is not only geographical between the members of families dispersed throughout the world, it exists in many cases inside the souls of those who have left one country to build a new life in another.'The Farewell' succeeds, in my opinion, to be both a very Chinese film in its approach to traditions and social aspects, and a very universal film in describing the sometimes drama-filled relationships and the personal crises in families scattered around the world by emigration. Some of the most memorable scenes in the film take place around copious meals, shared in Chinese style, in which the family spread around the world gets together for the first time after many years of distance. These scenes have resonated for me and I think for many other viewers who have experienced emigration and separation from part of their families. Dramas, quarrels, joy mixed with nostalgia but also with old tensions resurrected or with new frictions created by distances and the different realities in which the family members live - these are all common to many families scattered around the world, be they Chinese, Irish, Jewish, Italian , East European, Latin American, African, or of any other origin. The other theme of the film, that of the confrontation with the terminal illness of a close relative, will also be familiar to many viewers who have encountered such situations in life. The dilemma faced by the heroes of the film, whether or not to communicate to the mother and grandmother remained in China the news of the fatal malady that is likely to kill her in no more than three months, is presented by Lulu Wang as a cultural dispute between the Western and traditionally Chinese approaches in such a situation. However, many other families in all corners of the world have encountered it.""The Farewell' demonstrates the merits and the limitations of the genre. As it is structured, the film could be distributed in China as well, which is fine, but the differences between China and the rest of the world are not just cultural, and the film completely avoids any direct political reference. On the other side, the family drama is played with sensitivity and finesse, cultural differences approached with discretion, humor and respect for tradition. Awkwafina is one of the singers who are launching actresses' careers, others have done it, among them Björk and Lady Gaga, but each time they have disappeared after outstanding but singular demonstrations of talent and well-deserved success. I hope that it will not happen and with her. The role of the young American who came a child from China, keeping in mind the memories and nostalgia for the country of origin, living her American life without breaking with her roots, is perfectly suited to Awkwafina and this year's Golden Globe Award shines in my eyes. as strong as the Academy Award. Chinese actress Shuzhen Zhao plays the role of grandmother, and she is excellent as well. The whole cast is actually very good, and towards the end of the film we have the feeling that we were adopted into this family. I do not know Chinese realities well enough to comment on the authenticity of details, situations, sets, but they all seemed interesting and well drawn. 'The Farewell' does not completely avoid stereotypes and common places, but uses them with finesse and places them in the right spots. Recommended viewing.",The Farewell
19,ThomasDrufke,Perfect Blend of Drama & Comedy,8,7 August 2019,"Much like Wild Rose earlier this summer, I've been waiting for The Farewell to hit a theater near me for quite a few weeks. And unsurprisingly, it does not disappoint. The Farewell is both an incredibly unique story to Chinese culture, but an endearing & relatable story for almost everyone no matter your background. There's so much originality to this story and a poignant sense of loss within a family dynamic. It went in directions I certainly did not expect, but dramatically and comedically. When you realize this is based on an ""actual lie"", the story only becomes that much better. Also, it's worth noting how good Awkwafina is here, especially being that I haven't been her biggest fan in other films. If there's any good in this world, The Farwell will be around come awards season talk.8.8/10",The Farewell
20,gbill-74877,Powerful,9,29 July 2019,"Awkwafina is fantastic in this film, and she's so easy to relate to because she doesn't give off any other vibe than being real. It's a great cast overall too, and it's hard to imagine one that feels more natural. The plot is tightly focused, but at the same time, the film manages to touch on a broad spectrum of things, e.g. immigration, family, parenting, sacrifice, the cultural differences between east and west, and of course, death. There is quite a bit of humor in the script, and even more if you recognize similarities in situations or behavior from real life, so don't be too put off by what may seem like a depressing premise. With that said, bring the Kleenex. There is more than a little poignancy to the young woman talking to her grandmother over the few days that make up the film, because we know with each interaction what she knows, that it may be the last of its kind. Loved the direction from Lulu Wang and some of the images she captured, in addition to the mood she set. Among other things, she gets a good snapshot of China as it rapidly changes. I thought my only complaint was going to be the very, very last shot before the credits roll which seemed to undercut the fabulous shots before it, but as it's based on a true story and that's actually her, well, that's not really valid.My favorite quote is when the uncle says to his American niece ""You think one's life belongs to oneself, but that's the difference between the East and the West. In the East, a person's life is part of a whole."" He then goes on to say that while it may seem wrong not to tell the dying grandmother, they refrain from doing so out of ""duty to carry this emotional burden for her."" That was a brilliant moment.",The Farewell
21,Cineanalyst,An Actual Lie,9,14 December 2019,"""The Farewell"" is a thoughtful piece of filmmaking. Yes, it's touching and handles the Chinese-American culture clash with sophistication, but it's also cleverly self-referential of the process of telling and, inevitably, fictionalizing a true story. It's ""based on an actual lie,"" as stated from the outset. A pet peeve of mine are movies that claim to be ""based on a true story"" but are obviously dramatized in many ways without any acknowledgement, thus negating any intelligent investigation into the fundamental dichotomy of motion pictures, or, to an extent, storytelling in general, as objective recorder and manufactured illusion.The story of ""The Farewell,"" on the other hand, is all about lying, characters arguing whether to tell the truth and, ultimately, constructing stories of various degrees of truthiness to tell each other. The shifts between languages--mainly English and Mandarin--play into this. Besides the main secret and the connected mock wedding, there's also the protagonist's rejection letter for a Guggenheim Fellowship, her mother's and everyone else's display or concealment of emotion, hiding smoking, where one is or what they're doing during a phone call, and even the birds motif gives the lie to symbolism--to how one sees themselves and the world. That is to say not only how one perceives the character's illness, but also extends to the theme of American individualism in contrast with Chinese values placing family and society first, as well as to how the spectator views movies, as reflected reality or fabricated fiction. The movie itself is authored by the ""real Billi,"" writer-director Lulu Wang, who already told a version of it on the radio program ""This American Life."" The picture is entirely told from the perspective of Billi (as portrayed by Awkwafina), who is an aspiring writer who will one day tell this very story and, indeed, is the on-screen surrogate for doing so within the picture. Interestingly, the character who decides to conceal Nai Nai's terminal lung cancer from her, her sister, is played by the real woman, Lu Hong, the part is based on. Thus, we have an actress pretending the part of the truth-telling author and the real woman as herself telling the lie. This is not simply a sappy story.Having seen many classic Hollywood films, it seems that hiding one's illness from them (especially if they're female) used to be a common practice in America, too. Much of the time, if I recall correctly, such incidents served as melodramatic twists in these films--hence why I'm hard-pressed to think of a title I can mention without spoilers. One stars Bette Davis, and that's all I'll say. Regardless, the point I'm building up to here is that ""The Farewell"" is as remarkably restrained from histrionics as its characters often are in hiding their feelings from Nai Nai. Sure, it's an emotional experience, but it's a remarkable job that this isn't overly melodramatic. In fact, it's quite humorous at times.Visually, this is a well-made picture, as well. It's no easy task to make appear interesting lots of talking scenes with intermittent moments of silent, wistful looks. The rhythm of wide-shot framing, often in long takes, with the few intimate close-ups here is exceptional, as is the occasional exploration of space out of frame, as with the opening shot of a hospital painting that reveals no visual information as to who is talking. We never discover the secrets of birds entering and exiting interiors, either. Even the slow-motion and spinning-camera tricks later on work. It's as though photographically, too, the picture is both being honest with the spectator and withholding secrets from them. Awkwafina and Zhao Shuzhen (as Nai Nai) heading a terrifically expressive cast also helps, as does the camera's focus on them, who are mostly actors playing characters who are acting out the lie, while Nai Nai stages the central deceit of the wedding--a sort of play-within-the-play supposedly for her own benefit. Even the farewell itself, it's revealed, isn't the final goodbye.""The Farewell"" is so excellent I'm hesitant to compare it with ""Crazy Rich Asians"" (2018), which, despite some rave reviews by others, is a trashy rom-com. Such couplings of the two movies by the media made me somewhat reluctant to see ""The Farewell"" in the first place. Granted, however, they are two popular American co-productions about and starring Asian-Americans, which has traditionally been rare (but will not continue to be given the growing market importance of China, as well the increasing population of Asian Americans). There's the resulting culture class of the characters traveling from New York to East Asia--both for a wedding. Awkwafina is in both. The similarities end there, though. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" is a soap-opera celebration of conspicuous consumption for its own sake and is otherwise obnoxious and formulaic. It's a lie told to us. ""The Farewell"" involves what appears to be a more middle-class family and is in every way more restrained, reflective and even honest. It's a movie that actually matters.",The Farewell

23,eddie_baggins,Awkwafina shines in this lovely family drama,8,11 December 2019,"Based on director Lulu Wang's real life experiences, The Farewell has become one of 2019's most beloved surprise hits and for good reason, as Wang's lovingly crafted and passionate family drama is a truly heart-warming tale.Featuring a breakout performance from rising star Awkwafina, who shows a completely different side to her acting self as the lost yet likeable Billi, in what's a role far removed from her notable turns in the likes of Ocean's 8 and Crazy Rich Asians, The Farewell is the type of deeply personal and soulful human centric film that can only come from a place of love and respect.Based on what we're told is a ""true lie"", The Farwell see's Billi and her mother and father Haiyan and Lu Jian (played wonderfully by Tzi Ma and Diana Lin) traveling back to their hometown of Changchun in China under the guise of a wedding banquet event, that masks the fact they are actually back home to spend time with their cancer ridden family matriarch Nai Nai, of whom they are keeping in the dark about her diagnoses.It doesn't exactly sound like the premise for a funny, truthful and emotionally rich narrative but Wang's ability to respectfully acknowledge Chinese tradition and beautifully capture the strong family ties and Chinese ways of life, ensures that The Farewell feels like a fresh and unpredictable piece of movie-making, in what's usually a by the numbers family drama fair.In many ways The Farwell has the intimacy and true to life nature of a documentary, as we very quickly begin to feel like a fly on the wall to Billi's life at this time as she try's hard to deal with feeling like an early life failure and a bad granddaughter to a person she respects and it's in this respect that The Farwell well and truly unearths the true talents of both Wang and Awkwafina in what's likely to be a busy awards season run and future establishing project for the two industry figures.We've often been gifted in times past to comedians genuinely surprising us all with their abilities to turn funny and manic persona's into seriously impressive dramatic turns (think Jim Carey in The Truman Show or Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting) and it's no different here with Awkwafina, who dials her established brand right down to ground level to create a thought-provoking and awards calibre turn around an ensemble that makes for one of the year's best. On the back of this effort, she's announced herself to the world as a seriously diverse talent.Final Say -It may not break any new ground but The Farewell's abundance of heart, soul and great performances makes it a highly enjoyable dramatic treat, that firmly places Lulu Wang and her star Awkwafina on the path to super-stardom in the process.4 karaoke performances out of 5",The Farewell
24,Red-125,"""In the U.S. that would be illegal.""",9,4 August 2019,"The Farewell (2019) is a Chinese movie written and directed by Lulu Wang.It stars Awkwafina as Billi, a young woman who was born in China but who now lives in New York City, and Shuzhen Zhao, her grandmother (Nai Nai) who lives in China.In the opening minutes of the movie, we learn that Billi has failed to win a Guggenheim fellowship, and that Nai Nai has terminal lung cancer. For the remainder of the plot the film moves to China, where Kai Kai's family has gathered to say farewell.The problem is that no one wants to tell Nai Nai that she is close to death. As one of her children says, ""In the U.S. that would be illegal."" However, according to the movie, in China that information is withheld from people until the few days of their lives.The problem is that when all the family comes to Nai Nai's to say farewell, she will realize the truth. The solution is to have a fake wedding for Nai Nai's other grandchild, who lives in Japan. The plot continues from that point.The two lead actors are excellent, and the supporting cast is just as strong. Some reviewers wrote that the movie is too melodramatic, but I thought the opposite. We are watching portrayals of real people, each of whom has come to a point in their lives when they have learned many things about themselves, but are still able to learn more. None of them is evil, but none of them is perfect either. There's room for improvement, and many of them are trying to improve. That's not melodrama. It's a depiction of life.We saw this film at Rochester's great Little Theatre, but it will work as well on the small screen. It has an amazingly high IMDb rating of 8.2. (This rating doesn't come from a handful of raters. As I write this review the movie has been rated by over 2,300 IMDb members.) It's a wonderful film. Don't miss it!P.S. The lead actor, Awkwafina, wasn't born in China. She was born in New York City. In the movie, she apologizes for her imperfect Chinese. I wonder if she really does speak imperfect Chinese.

25,TheMovieDiorama,The Farewell waves goodbye to clichés and welcomes humanistic endearment.,9,21 September 2019,"Death. A significant part of life. For if one must live, they also must decease. The natural order of existence. But what if you acknowledged the inevitability of your demise? The apprehension that one night you will never wake up. Would knowing that your health deterioration, in this case stage four lung cancer, has granted you a finite amount of time change the way you spend your last months alive? In China, it is tradition for family members to withhold this information. To suffer with the emotional burden and make the remaining days as optimistic as possible. Naturally, the conflict of emotive responses becomes difficult to balance, with bursts of sorrow frequently overwhelming falsified happiness.In this personal directorial feature, Wang's own ""actual lie"" includes a family preparing a pseudo-wedding in order for their ""Nai Nai"" (paternal grandmother in Mandarin) to see all family members one last time. The marriage of cultural particularities, exploring the moralities of upholding a lie that is deemed illegal in western nations, with relatable earnest themes to create a stunningly honest feature that revolves around family. Wang has essentially created a film about death. Yet achieved this by masterfully balancing sharp humorous dialogue with melancholic tones, alluding to a light dramatic comedy. For every laugh, there is a tear. Exhuming the tight embrace that family has to offer, rarely releasing from its grasp.Whilst Wang courageously traversed familial love at a time of substantial loss, she also permitted an introspective look into an American immigrant rediscovering her traditional roots. A long forgotten heritage differing in ideology and principles, providing a formidable transition that offers sentimentality without resorting to melodrama. It all stems from Wang's ingenious screenplay, merging conscientious humour with dramatic power, charging at the audience's hearts at maximum velocity. A prime example of the sheer beautiful longevity that Wang tonally constructs, would be ""Chinese people have a saying: When people get cancer, they die."". An adequate amount of subtle humour whilst tackling the heavy subject matter at hand. It's stunning. Absolutely incredibly stunning. And when Wang wants you to cry, she'll hold you down til you do.This is mostly down to the nullified performances that purposefully felt restrained. Awkwafina, proving herself as a formidable dramatic actress, commanded the dialogue with her simplistic yet nuanced delivery. Her facial expressions, glistening eyes and dysphoric spirit resulted in her character resembling our western perspective. The clashing of cultures. The moral dilemma. The perfect performance. With Wang supplying elongated sequences with the members staring at the camera against the eloquent symphonic score provided by Weston, to harness the sorrow of the situation. However, it's Shuzhen's benign role as ""Nai Nai"" that truly squeezes at the heart. The fragility and innocence she conveys will force you to cry during every scene. Whether it be happiness or sadness, her matriarchal role proved powerful. That final wave goodbye? I'm still recovering.Occasionally certain scenes felt too restrained for their own good, unable to emanate the raw emotional response Wang was striving for, which hindered the overall desolation by the smallest of degrees.However, small criticism aside, Wang has produced an intimate portrayal of cultural contrast. A luminescent feature that is illuminated by an earnest screenplay that deftly highlights the talent of everyone involved both on and off screen, cementing this as one of the best films of the year without a doubt. I want to conclude by leaving a poignant line that summarises the film perfectly. ""Life is not just about what you do. It's more about how you do it."".",The Farewell

As the movie opens, thirty-something Billi is on the phone when Nai Nai, her grandma back in China. (We later learn that Billi and her parents moved to America 25 years ago when she was 6.) Nai Nai is at the hospital with her sister for some tests. Turns out that Nai Nai has terminal cancer with only 3 more months to live, but her sister tells her instead that the tests went well and that Nai Nai ha a lean bill of health. Billi's parents are informed of this, but everyone agrees to keep the bad news from Nai Nai. Instead, the family takes the upcoming wedding of Billi's cousin as an excuse for one final family gathering presided by Nai Nai... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie. Will someone spill the beans to Nai Nai? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the second feature-length from writer-director Lulu Wang, and bringing the true story of the lie told to her real life Nai Nai. The movie is mostly set in Changchun, China (where Wang's family hails from) and plays out over a period of less than a week. Wang lets us experience the different cultures and collective thinking that exists in China vs, the US (""in the West you think your life belongs to you, but in the East your life is merely a part of family, of society""). If you have been to China, you know that meals are an important part of the family culture (and business world), hence no surprise that meals are featured prominently in the movie. The role of Billi is played by Awkwafina, who has with this film yet another trophy on her belt (after ""Ocean's 8"" and ""Crazy Rich Asians""). Yet for all the great stuff that can be and already has been said about this movie (more on that later), I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed, in that the movie plays out EXACTLY as one would've suspected it.

Its a real shame too because 'The Farewell' is a very good film. It's simple in nature, but also beautiful and thoughtful at the same time.

At first it was horrifying to me, but as the film went on to explain, this is actually quite normal procedure in Chinese culture. I'm glad its not a part of my culture, but I can at least understand where they are coming from with wanting it as a part of theirs. The film does an excellent job of explaining Chinese culture and why it so different from western culture.I loved the music in this film. It is used perfectly to both set the tone the film is trying to convey, and also to show just what a wonderful family this is that we are following.

30,Turfseer,Heartfelt Chinese Grandma death watch has nowhere to go,4,10 September 2019,"The Farewell is second feature director Lulu Wang's Sundance project which has received almost universal acclaim by the critics. Wang, a Chinese-American, came to the US as a child, and developed her stories based upon her own experiences.
The story involves Billi (based on Wang herself), whose paternal grandmother, Nai Nai, has been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer back in mainland China where she has always lived. The family, following cultural traditions, decides not to tell her, and creates an elaborate ruse (a wedding for Billi's cousin who resides in Japan) as an opportunity for all the relatives to get together and say their final farewells.
Billi is played by the comedian and rapper Awkwafina, most recently seen in Crazy Rich Asians. When Billi learns of her grandmother's diagnosis, she decides to fly to China from NY on her own after her parents have already arrived there. Awkwafina unfortunately has a thankless role, with Billi portrayed as constantly dour (as well as angry and sad) throughout the narrative.
Despite all-around good performances from the rest of the cast, beautiful cinematography and a welcome peek into Chinese middle class culture, Wang's premise is a one-note idea. Some of the machinations involve the comedy of the family members keeping the diagnosis from the grandmother. After a while, this one note idea of hiding the truth becomes stale.
We do learn from Billi's uncle the reason why the family prefers not to inform the grandmother of her illness (they feel it's more honorable if others shoulder the burden of knowing and not ruining the rest of the time the grandmother has left). There are also some very nice heartfelt expressions of emotion from both Billi and her uncle at the wedding reception, at film's end. All of this is still not enough to save The Farewell which ends up as an exercise in almost continuous sentimentality.
Without giving away the twist at the very end of the film, suffice it to say it's not always a good idea to rely completely on the medical profession's diagnoses.",The Farewell

35,kluseba,Spend as much time with your loved ones as you can while you can,8,5 September 2019,"The Farewell is a bittersweet Chinese tragicomedy that has the potential to become an Academy Award winner for Best International Feature Film. The movie revolves around an elderly Chinese lady who suffers from an incurable cancer. Her sister however hides this information from her and instead tries to bring all the family together for one last time. A hastily arranged wedding between a grandson and his Japanese girlfriend serves as purpose for the family members abroad to come back to Changchun. However, the burden of this lie is heavy and conflicts, confusion and misunderstandings soon occur.The most interesting question about this movie is how you would deal with a situation such as the one portrayed in this film if someone close to you were concerned and how you would like to be treated if you were in a similar situation yourself. The family members in this film try to carry the burden together and decide to not tell the aged grandmother that she is dying. There is no right way to deal with such a difficult decision. If you hide the truth, you might prevent the other person to live every day as if it were the last day and to say farewell. If you tell the truth, you will cause an immense emotional burden to the concerned person who will live in fear of dying every single day. The Farewell offers much food for thought and also shows how differently Western and Eastern cultures approach such a scenario.The acting performances in this film are outstanding. Every character has its own identity from the drunk war veteran who was in love with the elderly lady over the chubby grandchild who is addicted to technology to the deaf housemate who is the only one to mind his own business. Lead actress Nora Lum convinces as concerned granddaughter who disagrees with her family's strategy of hiding the truth from her grandmother and who also has some financial and social problems of her own. Shuzhen Zhao steals the show in her very first movie as headstrong elderly lady with a heart of gold.The movie portrays the differences between Western and Eastern cultures cleverly and also portrays how the Chinese society is changing. People have become greedy capitalists looking for financial opportunities abroad but also try to embrace their ethnic heritage at the same time. Changchun has developed from a rather small city with less than a million citizens to a gigantic city with close to eight million citizens in only fifty years. The movie shows how gigantic buildings and monuments have replaced small houses and gardens.The Farewell also has alight-hearted side and manages to cheer its audience up despite numerous heartbreaking moments. The subtle humour works very well and includes drunk war veterans declaring their romantic feelings, hilarious karaoke performances during the wedding and several running jokes in form of the careless deaf housemate and the disconnected overweight grandson.In the end, The Farewell is an emotional tragicomedy with a profound message: to spend as much time with your loved ones as you can while you can. As someone who is living abroad and far away from his family, I can truly empathize with the movie's meaningful message. Give this movie the chance to inspire your brain and warm your heart.",The Farewell

I love how there are no sad songs or grandma lying in hospital bed images, the movie is only focused on relationship between grandma and her granddaughter and her whole family.

Awkawfina is in limbo awaiting to hear if she got into a fellowship (she receives a letter that she didn't) but her own personal issues are put on the back-burner when she hears her grandmother (whom she is very fond of) has late stage cancer. Her parents decide to head back to the mainland to put on an elaborate charade (the whole family is in on it) to keep the grandmother occupied w/the planning of some cousin's wedding instead of giving her the news outright. As put forth by the film, the Chinese believe its better to lie to the doomed family member because the news can be just as devastating as the malady itself. The parents, fearing Awkawfina will fess up to the truth, leave her behind in the States but she soon comes along putting the extended family into a proverbial pickle. For the remainder of the film, we get a push/pull effect as we see the grandmother at her happiest even though her health belies her feelings.

40,truemythmedia,Best Movie of 2019,10,26 November 2019,"""The Farewell"" is in the running for my top film of 2019. It seems crazy to me that I am writing those words, considering that ""The Lighthouse,"" ""Parasite,"" and ""Midsommar"" all released this year but here we are, living in a strange reality where a PG rated movie rivals the R-rated high-concept pack. I can't honestly say that I saw this one coming.""The Farewell"" is a rare find because while it is a small story with only a few characters that feels monumental and important. It succeeds in waking the heart from a slumber it doesn't even know it is held within and raising it to embrace those we do not understand or necessarily agree with and learn something completely unexpected yet incredibly real and familiar.From the outset, most people who see this film will be drawn in by the premise. In China, apparently, they do not always inform their elderly when they have a terminal disease in order to help maintain the ill persons quality of life and peace of mind for as long as is possible. They go so far as to actively hide the fact of their disease from them, and in this film, since her family live all over the world, Nai Nai's family decides to hold a fake wedding ceremony in order to allow them all to return to China and visit with her without raising suspicion.At first, in ""The Farewell,"" the only one who has a problem with this is Billie (Awkwafina, ""Ocean's 8"") since she was raised in America for the most part and thus has the least amount of Chinese culture built into her way of doing things. She is appalled that they intend to lie to Nai Nai (Shuzhen Zhao) and most of her family actually leave for China without Billie since they suspect she will just spill the beans. Of course, it wouldn't be much of a movie if she didn't hop a plane and surprise them all by showing up and playing along, though begrudgingly.There are a couple of things in this movie that I found especially delightful, on top of the cultural exploration aspect, which is really not that strong considering that the premise makes it sound like you may be finding out about ""one-crazy-custom-after-another"" (read in a ridiculous over the top voice). You really don't.Instead, you get a continually unfolding exploration of the various family members personal views on the situation and the opening of everyone's eyes to understand each other better. I won't spoil anything about the end except to say that I found it satisfying since the internal movements of characters is more the focus of the film than the external journey of whether or not they tell Nai Nai about her cancer. This exploration of people's assumptions and revelation of hidden emotions and events which make up each character lead to wonderful realizations when people's prejudices are brought up against the ways that they are wrong about what is actually going on.On top of the deft way that this film navigates its themes are some really special performances. Awkwafina delivers a performance that straight up establishes her in my mind as an actor to watch. So much of the film turns on her relationship with Shuzhen Zhao that if their chemistry had been off, the whole movie would've lost its soul. What we actually get are complex internal emotions playing across her face like the slightest reflection of light in a rippled pool, barely perceptible, yet immediately recognizable not just by the eye, but by the heart as well.The same could be said for Shuzhen Zhao who, though she knows in real life that her character has cancer, has to play it all as if she does not. Occasionally this leads to delightful humor but also heartache as we see someone speak with confidence that is unhindered by the truth yet does not feel tinged with a tragic subtle foreknowledge.This is truly a remarkable film which I hope people will add to their queues because it really does deserve a watch. In a world dominated by mistrust, assumption, dissidence, and rancor, people need a truly heart-opening story to balance themselves out from the constant stream of ""fighting"" movies in today's cinemas.",The Farewell
41,jadepietro,You Had Me at Hello,8,13 January 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A well-acted family drama that wholeheartedly entertains while avoiding the serious subject of cancer and death.JIM'S REVIEW: These days, most films claim to be based on facts. Lulu Wang's intimate little film, The Farewell, takes the exact opposite approach. It begins with a title card stating that this film is ""based on a lie""...which is true...and the primary source of inspiration for this writer/director.This domestic drama involves a family in crisis. Nai Nai (Zhao Shuzhen) has stage four cancer. Hiding the reality about her medical diagnosis from their grandmother is a group decision that impacts every family member. Especially hard hit is her devoted Chinese-American granddaughter, Billi (Awkwafina), whose has been relocated with her parents in New York City as a small child and does not agree with this deception. However, this tragic news reunites the family as they gather together and visit China under the guise of a cousin's wedding. The family will share the emotional burden and shield it from Nai Nai, as Eastern culture demands.Ms. Wang's highly personal screenplay avoids sentimental traps and tells her tale with an open and direct vision. The subject matter may be sad and depressing, but the film treatment is not. She layers her story about death, cultural differences, and family dynamics with a rare sensitivity that becomes the film's major asset.Another strong point is the cast. They all create characters that are totally convincing, with the aforementioned Ms. Shuzhen and Awkwafina delivering delightful performances. Tzi Ma and Diana Lin as Billi's parents are also very memorable. As Billi's uncle, Jiang Yongbo has some fine moments as well as Lu Hong as her great aunt, Little Nai Nai.The film itself continually underplays the dramatic situation, more than it needs. One wishes there were a bit more conflict on view. Just as the characters avoid any real emotional gravitas, so does this talented filmmaker. It's all so sweet and unassuming, yet devoid of any genuine pathos. Despite the film's high entertainment value, the end result becomes a thesis on death-lite and a bit too sanitized and simplistic for this reviewer.The Farewell remains an earnest and well-acted drama. Like many family reunions, everyone wants to leave a positive impression and show off its best behavior, never wanting to overstay its welcome before it bids goodbye. On that matter, the film does that. It plays it ""relatively"" safe, yet fully succeeds with its many inherent charms.",The Farewell

43,rannynm,A Story That Millions of American Families Can Relate To,10,17 July 2019,"The Farewell, directed by Lulu Wang, played tug-of-war with my emotions as I felt a constant push and pull between crying and smiling! I became a part of Billi's family, empathizing with the family members because they reminded me of my own.Based on an actual lie, The Farewell tells the story of Billi (Awkwafina), a Chinese immigrant in America, and the relationship with her grandmother, Nai Nai (Shuzhen Zhou), who lives in China. When Billi finds out that her grandmother only has a few months left to live, Billi must grapple with the fact that her family doesn't wish to tell Nai Nai. Along with dealing with Nai Nai's imminent death, Billi struggles with her Chinese and American roots.The power of The Farewell comes from its simplicity. The most powerful scenes are those without music or dialogue, just Billi alone with her emotions. These scenes last several seconds and act as a window into Billi's heart. Awkwafina fully transforms into her character, letting her eyes convey Billi's indescribable pain to the audience. The cinematography by Anna Franquesa and Solano assists in amplifying the effect of the actors' emotions. The camera often frames Billi in the center of the screen, whether she is amongst a sea of people or alone in her room. Each time the camera does so, I felt how the sorrow forms a small bubble around her that is only visible to the audience, especially if she is pretending to smile or laugh. Once again, there is a simplicity in the cinematography that carries power. This simplicity even extends to the music by Alex Weston. The music is comprised of only a few string instruments and a simple melody. However, every time it plays it reflects the emotions of Billi, giving me goosebumps.My favorite part is how this movie depicts immigrant families and their struggles. Being Indian, but born and brought up in America, I found several similarities between Nai Nai and my own mother and grandmother. At certain moments, I was laughing out loud because Nai Nai says something that I have heard countless times in my own family. In this way, The Farewell brings a story that millions of American families can relate to, that is not often found in Hollywood movies.The message is that family is precious. I give The Farewell 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18. Be sure to check out The Farewell which opened in theatres nationwide July 12, 2019.Reviewed by Sahiba K., KIDS FIRST!

44,martimusross,"Quite Charming, Quite Slow & Quite Entertaining.",6,16 September 2019,"The FarewellThis was a very gentle comic movie with no pretence at profundity. It sought to examine the foibles of a large Chinese family as they tried to come to terms with the imminent demise of a much loved grandmother.It was built on two contrived dilemmas, firstly the impulse to be truthful when the very truth might hasten death and secondly the stoic ability not to grieve in front of someone that is not dead yet. I think the director achieved her goal in relating these very real inner conflicts ciphered through very different personalities and experiences.It was slow, very little happened, and the emotional situations seemed forced, so this movie is not for everyone and is instantly forgettable.However, I enjoyed this movie immensely, the cinematography and editing kept our interest, it was warm and very much dwelt on the frailty of the human condition. Shuzhen Zhao, as the grandmother, was perfectly cast and dominated every scene. The other actors were merely a foil for her expression.The Granddaughter played by Awkwafina tried to excel with what she was given, there was just insufficient for any real nuance or definable character development, perhaps an opportunity missed here.",The Farewell

46,blott2319-1,Great look at family life differences in China,9,26 September 2020,"The Farewell is a tribute to family and an exploration of what sets Chinese culture apart from our own. Writer/Director Lulu Wang drew upon the true story of her own grandmother to inspire this film, and the authenticity of the story shined through. There's something special going on in The Farewell, because I went through an emotional journey with the main character. It's strange how you can start the film feeling that this entire idea and the pretense of their trip to China is so wrong, and then end up seeing the value of it to the point that you don't want the charade ruined. I can't even point to a particular moment or event that was the tipping point which changed my mind, and I don't know if our main character could either. She is clearly transformed by this time with her family, and begins to see that the way of life in China is different, but that doesn't mean it's wrong. The other thing that was magical about The Farewell is that it managed to find humor in the darkness. It's not a big goofy and hilarious comedy, in fact I probably shed more tears than I laughed, but considering how this whole film could feel because of the subject matter, the fact that I was able to find joy in some moments was great.There were a number of great performances in The Farewell. I absolutely adored Shuzhen Zhao as the grandmother Nai Nai. She has such a delightful joy in her performance that you instantly fall in love with her. I think Awkwafina did a fine job as Billi, the protagonist. I did question some times if she was capable of portraying the layers of emotions that would be going through her character's mind, but she was good enough that she didn't take me out of the film. I also thought that Tzi Ma and Yongbo Jiang were marvelous as the two brothers who are trying to be the emotionless rocks for their family, and sometimes find that they too can't hide their feelings indefinitely. The Farewell also has a beautiful visual aesthetic, and I loved the way some of the shots were framed. There are a few scenes where just the staging and the way they cut to a shot made me laugh out loud. It's one of those movies where I felt there was a lot of thought and intention in the way things looked. Perhaps that comes from Lulu Wang visualizing these events so vividly from her past, and knowing how they needed to look and feel on the big screen. The Farewell is a heart-warming film that made me think about what I would do in the same situation, and made me cry a lot too. Getting me both emotionally and logically invested in the plot is an impressive feat.",The Farewell
47,proud_luddite,Outstanding Screenplay by Wang,9,30 September 2019,"Billi Wang (Akwafina) is a young aspiring writer in New York whose family had immigrated from China when she was six years old. She maintains a happy telephone relationship with her paternal grandmother, Nai Nai (Zhao Shuzhen) who still lives in China in the city of Changchun. Billi's family has received news from another relative that Nai Nai is dying of lung cancer. The extended families travel to Changchun to celebrate the wedding of Billi's cousin although the collective intention is really to say goodbye to Nai Nai - while withholding the news from her that she is dying.Throughout the film - and especially by the end, it is very clear that is biographical and based on the experiences of the film's talented writer/director Lulu Wang. The story is rich for various reasons including its unique take on the universal theme of dealing with the impending death of a beloved elderly relative.Billi is also a stand-in for many ""new world"" North Americans who would find it terribly wrong to withhold from anyone the fact that they are dying. Her points are well expressed but so are the contradictory replies from her elders and those more in line with a Chinese cultural tradition of such secrecy. The reply to the question ""who's right"" is answered in Nai Nai's laid-back, content demeanour (when not coughing), totally oblivious to her diagnosis. This is one of the fascinating surprises of ""The Farewell"" in its acquiescence to old-world values in subtle ways. Here, Wang must be given credit for her humility. She seems to have nodded to a sarcastic quote attributed to Oscar Wilde: ""I am not young enough to know everything"".The main story is powerful enough; yet Wang adds to the wealth by delving into the immigration experience - for those who left their homeland as well as those left behind. Here again, she takes on a universal theme. In conversations and monologues, the viewer hears what it is like to lose all of one's children (two sons in this case) as they leave the homeland (Nai Nai's other son emigrated to Japan). Billi also has a powerful monologue of what it was like to leave behind an extended family and community when she was six. While intelligently avoiding platitudes, the film asks: is there really a 'better life' somewhere else?The fine cast does justice to Wang's eloquent story. Awkwafina fits well in the lead role and Zhao's Nai Nai is so loveable that she makes it very easy to see why so many would grieve her impending death. One particular scene stands out even though it is brief: Billi's mother (Diana Lin) quietly avoiding eye contact in a taxi while fighting back tears. In less than a minute, Lin conveys an experience of every adult at least once in our lives. - dbamateurcriticRATING: 9 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Screenplay by Lulu Wang",The Farewell

However, her Family doesn't tell Nai Nai that she's sick, that she's dying.Her Dad Haiyan, played by compassionate Tzi Ma, and his older brother Haibin, played by gentle Yongbo Jiang, construct their narrative: The family would return to Changchun, China for the wedding of Haibin's son Hao Hao, played by Han Chen, and his Japanese bride Aiko, Aoi Mizuhara. They will all say their ""Goodbye"" to Nai Nai, then. 25 years ago, Haiyan's family immigrated to New York. While Haibin's family immigrated to Japan.In Chinese tradition, a person is part of the whole, of family. Consequently, Chinese culture deems it far kinder not to tell family members that they are gravely ill, that they are going to die. So that they may live out the rest of their lives in peace. At least that's the noble intention.Yet for Billi, controlling the narrative occurs far more than unkind: It's just wrong. During Nai Nai's emergency medical visit, Billi outs the narrative speaking in English to Dr. Song, played by charming Jim Liu, ""It's a lie."" He replies, ""It's a good lie."" Not understanding English, Nai Nai then inquires if young handsome Dr. Song is single. Because, her favorite granddaughter Billi is still unmarried. Yeah.That's the ironic beauty and poignancy of Writer- Director Lulu's ""The Farewell"". It's based on the lie she lived in her own life. So watching ""The Farewell"" is like watching life unfold. Will the ""good lie"" set you free?Awkwafina is the revelation. Her Billi loves her Nai Nai, so. She remembers fondly catching dragonflies with her as a child. Back in New York, she calls Nai Nai daily, just to talk. Billi is the former piano prodigy, now aspiring writer applying for the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship. Billi acutely discerns people. Awkwafina possesses the wondrous gift of letting us know what's going on inside in her glance, in her silence. She's amazing.Shuzhen as Nai Nai is total authenticity. She's a genuine character whether she's commenting about Hao Hao and Aiko's possible lack of sex life or teaching Billi morning Tai Chi, ""Ha. Ha."" She's so full of life and joy.Awkwafina and Shuzhen's screen partnership in ""The Farewell"" is truly something special to behold. Billi's own family apparently has suffered in their trials and tribulations. Haiyan is a good man, a recovering alcoholic. Her Mom Jian, played by subtly strong Diana Lim, seemingly had to prove herself to Nai Nai. Jian warns her Billi that she must participate in the ""lie"" on their visit to Changchun. This is tough for Billi, who wears her emotion on her sleeve, especially when it comes to Nai Nai.Paradoxically, Lulu freely invents her narrative about unconditional love, about family. As Awkwafina both laughs and cries, I got it: Nai Nai was really the only one who truly gets her Billi, who she is. Billi could be her authentic self with her. Nai Nai always loved Billi, always had her back. In the touching confession, Nai Nai tells Billi, ""It's not what you do, it's how you do it..."" She's so proud of her granddaughter. She always sees the greater than within her.I was in tears in the final scenes of ""The Farewell"", but not for what you might surmise. Life is in the surprise, the unexpected. Yes, cultures may occur as different or foreign, yet humanity is essentially the same. Lulu Wang, Awkwafina, and Shuzhen tell their very personal story of family, of love that touched my heart. ""The Farewell"" is my favorite movie of the year.",The Farewell
51,RforFilm,Awkwafina makes The Farewell an interesting character piece that explores families and Chinese tradition,7,11 September 2019,"It's an old saying, but it's true when people tell you that we don't really know what we had until we lost it. This is usually the case from people that have lost a relative. A grandparent, cousins we rarely talk to or even a parent we're estranged from. Perhaps we would tell ourselves ""we'll do more things next year"" or ""their not going anywhere soon"", only to get the news that they were hit by a bus or succumbed to an illness they never disclosed. The people that experience this feeling of being too late will often feel guiltier and thus grieve a lot longer.Because I'm close with my family, I'm usually ready when one is about to leave life. But I've had friends that have felt like they could have done more. Their not bad people and haven't done anything wrong, but it does remind us that there's a lot of value in something we can see anytime. So when we get the world that one of them is dying, do we spend time trying to keep them alive or do we carry on like everything is normal. Chinese tradition within death is explored within the new comedy/drama, The Farewell.An aspiring Chinese American writer Billi (played by Awkwafina) is struggling to get her work made as she's rejected from a Guggenheim Fellowship, but tries to keep her life going. She has a lot of support from her grandmother Nai Nai who she talks to consistently. While visiting her parents, her father gets the word that Nai Nai has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and has been given a few months to live. It's also revealed that the extended family won't tell Nai Nai about her own illness and are even planning a quick wedding in Changchun, China as an excuse for everyone to see her one last time.Billi is encouraged to stay home as her parents feel she's too emotional to keep the secret, but ends up flying out there on her own. Though she's clearly wants to tell, the rest of the family puts up a happy wedding act. When she asks why, her father, mother, and extended family admit it's because of Chinese tradition and that most families will do it to enjoy the time left. This puts Billi in a position that not only questions her own peoples traditions, but figuring out just what just who she is now that she's back in China for the first time in years.The Farewell may seem like a depressing subject matter...and it can be. But at it's core, it's a character piece and a really good one to boast. I had no idea that this was an actual Chinese tradition, but it makes for an interesting one to discuss; this idea of whether people should know when their going to die. I myself would be at a crossroads. I guess it would depend on the person, but for Awkwafina's case, I can understand her struggle. The movie makes it clear that her grandmother was one of her last ties to her original country and how much she meant to her.Speaking of which, Awkwafina turns in a surprisingly great performance, considering she's known for comedy. Though she's written as a bit of a stand in character, especially for a western audience, she's still a fleshed out human as someone whose also going through depression. With the death of her closet family member close, this can't be good for her. The Farewell does well to explore all these territories while trying to fill in on the rest of the family.In a story like The Farewell, with a large cast, it's likely that some people are going to get lost in the shuffle. Though the wedding does go through, I did realize that I didn't care for these characters because I barley knew them. It would have been nice if the movie had gone further into some of the other family members besides Billi and her parents. You'd think this would put some of the other, younger family members on the spot. I respect the script for trying to keep the dilemma focused on one person, it's usually the rest the family that's going to add a lot.I'll give this seven Chinese wedding invitations out of ten. The Farewell is a really good character piece, but I still think other avenue could have made it even better. Though there's a hacking plot, my favorite example of this kind of story is the anime, Summer Wars, which has similar subject matters. Nevertheless, I still recommend it as it kept my interest throughout a story that normally would have boarded me.",The Farewell

This is between the comically reluctant grandson Hao Hao (Han Chen) and his new Japanese girlfriend Aiko (Aoi Mizuhara).Faced with seeing Nai Nai face-to-face, and being forced to ""celebrate"" together, can the family - and the emotionally attached Billi in particular - hold it together and keep the secret?You might naturally assume that given the subject matter that this was going to be SERIOUSLY heavy going. And in many ways you would be right. Most of us over 50 will have lost an elderly relative. And, unless it was a sudden event, you have probably been through the mental pain of having to drive away from a nursing home certain that that will be the final time you will see your loved one alive. If you are therefore not affected by this film, you are not human.However, the film is so beautifully put together, and the comedy - albeit some of it very dark - so brilliantly inserted that the film is an UTTER DELIGHT from start to end. There are truly insightful scenes that get under the skin of the well-developed social approach in China to family. (Like my wife they love big family dinners around a round-table!) Although there is always the teen - Bau (Jinhang Liu) in this case - with his face permanently in his phone!There are also scenes familiar to anyone who's visited China. The gaggle of ""helpful"" taxi drivers outside the airport made me laugh out loud.Also (unintentionally) funny are the multiple company logos at the start of the film. (This is reminiscent of a classic ""Family Guy"" scene).For such a 'small' film, the scale is sometimes truly cinematic. Director and writer, Lulu Wang, achieves some gloriously memorable movie moments. A stony-faced, determined march of the key players towards the camera - which could be subtitled ""The Magnificent Eight"" - is slo-mo'd for about 30 seconds and is utterly mesmeric. And a scene at a cemetery is a comic masterpiece of Chinese tradition. Bau of course still has his face in his phone throughout!This is only Lulu Wang's second feature, but it makes me now want to check out her first film (""Posthumous"").What I found particularly interesting is that the film is truly multi-cultural. It's not an American film with some local content crudely inserted to cater for the Far East markets. The film is an almost equal blend of American language and Mandarin language with subtitles.Lulu Wang is also not afraid to upset officials in either country. Which is better: US or China? The question keeps getting posed to Billi and discussed among the family. And - as you might expect - there are positives and negatives on each side. The film doesn't really take sides. It's a really balanced position to take.The music is by Alex Weston, and its one of the stars of the film. It's truly quirky with everything as diverse as a vocalised version of Beethoven's Sonata No. 8 ""Pathetique""; a karaoke version of ""Killing Me Softly""; and a hugely entertaining Chinese version of Niilson's ""Without You"" over the end titles.It's a brilliant ensemble cast (SAG awards, are you listening?), and everyone pulls their weight. Even the minor members of the cast are superb: Aoi Mizuhara in particular displays acute awkwardness brilliantly!But leading the charge is Awkwafina. She was in the disappointing ""Ocean's 8"" but much more memorable in ""Crazy Rich Asians"" as Rachel's wacky Singapore friend. Here it's a bravado performance that is genuinely moving. She IS the slightly sulky but emotionally crushed teen.""Sub-titles? I don't do sub-titles"" - Get a grip! Yes, this is a film that has sub-titles. But it uses them when required (unless you happen to be fluent in Mandarin that is!). There is also a large percentage of the film that is in English. It's all eminently watchable, even for ""sub-title-phobes"".This is a feelgood film about a tough subject. The ending of the film pulls off the trick of being both devastating and uplifting at the same time.So get yourself to the cinema and see this film! Without question, it gets my ""highly recommended"" tag. It's also firmly placed itself very high up in my ""Films of the Year"" list.And it's all ""based on a true lie""!(For the full graphical review, please go to One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

54,kjproulx,A Great Indie Gem,9,5 August 2019,"A24 is a studio that knows how to pick and choose their films wisely. Truthfully, I believe them to be the greatest current film studio, as far as releasing consistently great content. I will always back them as a company, so when I say one of their films is terrible (if the day ever comes), it must be a pretty bad movie. The Farewell is one of their latest theatrical releases and while it may not strike a cord for everyone like it did for me, this is a genuine film from start to finish, not straying away from the characters and story it's showcasing.Directed with a lot of care and effort by Lulu Wang, The Farewell follows a family as they travel to China in order to attend a wedding, simply as an excuse to bring the family together as a goodbye for a dying family member, who they refuse to give truthful information to. The fact that this is an actual things that goes on is kind of odd, seeing as most people usually know when doctors have given the information, but this ""based on a true lie"" as the film states, and it really did make for an emotionally compelling narrative.I've only really ever experienced Awkwafina as a comedic actress in films like Crazy Rich Asians or Ocean's 8, but she has now proven that dramatic work may suit her even more than comedic. The focus is on her throughout the majority of the film, as the broke, kind of immature young adult of the family, and the fact that she disagrees with this whole scenario is what brought this film home for me, making it feel relatable. The Farewell does many things right, but the number one thing is the characters surrounding the premise. This movie would have collapsed without them as the backbone.Lulu Wang is absolutely a director that I will be keeping an eye on after her work here. Only having done one other feature film in Posthumous, The Farewell feels like a giant leap forward and I can't wait to see how her career expands. The way she has delivered such a stellar cast of characters here feels more authentic than most films out there today, especially this year. With so many big budget films hitting cinemas, this movie feels like a giant refresher and I loved nearly every second of it.In the end, as always, hardly any films in history are flawless, but The Farewell definitely comes close. If anything, I found the movie to be a little too short, as I would have liked to explore more about what what said in the credits of the film. With that said, this is an exceptional drama that I will gladly revisit in the coming months/years. The performances alone deserve to be seen more than once. If the Oscars were being held soon, I would say Awkwafina definitely deserves some recognition. The Farewell is a great indie film that deserves more attention.",The Farewell
55,tm-sheehan,Average but not as good as Crazy Rich Asians,6,4 February 2020,"My Review - The Farewell
My Rating 6/10
Of course I'm interpreting customs of the Chinese population through Western eyes but this film which the titles explain is based on a true lie when the family decide to withhold the true medical prognosis of a terminal disease from their Grandmother is no ""Crazy Rich Asians "" .
It has a few similarities the same actress Akwafina who was hilarious as Peik Lin the cure and crazy best friend of the Bride Rachel and this film also has a big Crazy Rich Asian wedding but it's no where near the fun.
The family I found annoying and the movie itself just average Akwafina is a fine actress and it was interesting to see her in such a different role much more subdued and emotional but I didn't really engage much in this film.The music score drove me crackers I love Beethoven's Sonata 8 Pathetique but not sung acapella pop style especially when it's not even credited to Beethoven but composer Alex Weston ? Even the end title music was just as plagiarised its Harry Nilsson's Without You titled Senza Di Te by Fredo Viola .I suppose it fits in with the lie and deceit plot line of the movie but it didn't impress me much . The Farewell is ok has some fun moments ,especially the family visit to Grandads grave and maybe it's a lack of cultural understanding on my part but I was glad to say Farewell to this movie and can understand why it's not nominated for Best Movie in a Foreign Language at the Oscars .
Cultural understanding shouldn't matter if it's a great script I don't know much about Korean culture but I loved Parasite.",The Farewell

58,MrDHWong,"An honest, touching story about the importance of family no matter what part of the world you are from",8,30 December 2019,"The Farewell is a drama film written and directed by Lulu Wang. Starring Awkwafina in the lead role, it is an honest, touching story about the importance of family no matter what part of the world you are from.In New York City, Chinese-American Billi Wang (Awkwafina) lives in an apartment by herself while maintaining a close relationship with her grandmother Nai Nai (Zhao Shuzhen) over the phone from China. One day, Billi is told by her parents that Nai Nai has been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, leaving her with only a short time left to live. Rather than reveal this to Nai Nai, her family decide to keep it a secret to save her from the severity of hearing about such a life threatening illness, much to Billi's annoyance. As a means to see Nai Nai for one last time, the family decide to schedule a wedding as an excuse for all of her loved ones to visit her in China, hoping that Billi does not let up and reveal the truth.With a compassionate approach to its subject matter, The Farewell succeeds not only as a nice family drama, but also as an interesting discussion point about moral judgement. Throughout the film, Billi constantly questions whether or not it is the right thing to tell Nai Nai about her cancer, which makes her wrack her mind with guilt over such a dilemma. This puts her at odds with the rest of her family, who believe that withholding information like this prolongs life and that it is not necessarily the illness but the fear itself that ends up causing death. The constant culture clash between Billi's American-raised ideologies and her traditional Chinese beliefs makes for great dramatic tension and should provoke viewers into pondering on how they themselves would react in such a situation.Director Lulu Wang wisely decides to use an all Chinese cast with a large percentage of the dialogue spoken in Mandarin, adding an air of authenticity to the whole story. Considering that this film is based on Wang's real life experiences, it is easy to see how she can approach it so naturally without too much outside research on how a family in China would deal with this predicament. In spite of this, the themes of familial respect and dealing with grief remain universal, as one does not need to be of mixed race origin to understand such important things to enjoy the movie for what it is.Rapper-turned-actress Awkwafina gives a decidedly melancholic performance as Billi, as she almost feels like a fish-out-of-water in her home country of China due to her being raised in the United States most of her life. Her changing between speaking English and Mandarin at certain times serves as a reminder to the audience that she had roots in both countries and her internal battle between the two has her conflicted for most of the film. Unfortunately, the film does not touch upon Billi's American lifestyle enough to leave the impact it should. I would have preferred if we had seen her hanging out with her American friends and working her American job to get a better sense of how ingrained she is in her adoptive land. However, I believe true praise is deserved for the elderly Zhao Shuzhen as Nai Nai. She is such a sweet old lady that it is impossible to be annoyed at her whenever she does something wrong or is ignorant of her obvious cancer symptoms. Surprisingly, this is her feature film debut.Regardless of your ethnic origin, The Farewell will resonate with anyone deeply rooted in their own family traditions and personal beliefs. While we still may wish to question such things, sometimes it is for the best to just trust the judgement of your loved ones and simply go with the flow of life.I rate it 8/10",The Farewell

More often than not the scenes and the characters will feel more like a sit com than anything else - silly jokes and ridiculous people. But this film manages to ring true. The set up is simple, but it is all the little things that make it special. Every character is relatable, even if the culture or situation feels distant. Every little interaction along the way feels lived in. And those little moments add up. In the end, this movie is more than the sum of its parts. It is funny and real and touching in a way that few films manage to be.

61,ronakkotian,I feel homesick...,8,17 February 2021,"There are films out there that you watch for entertainment purposes and there are some which make you feel something inside emotionally. The Farewell is that kind of film.The Farewell follows a Chinese family that find out their grandmother has a short time to live and decide to organise a fake wedding to see her one last time.This film is clearly a very personal one to Lulu Wang and it's a beautiful film that I was also able to relate to a lot. It's interesting how Wang sets up these characters and to see how differently each person approaches this situation. All the way through I didn't feel like I was watching actors play these characters. The set up and execution of the events was handled so meticulously and felt like I was watching real people in this tough situation. It's a film that really spoke to me and I related especially with Billi. I also live far away from most of my relatives and The Farewell made me want to visit them more often, learn more about the culture in my home country and to essentially rediscover my roots.Lulu Wang approaches this story with a nice, healthy blend of comedy and drama. Her script is filled with funny moments but there are also plenty of scenes that will tug at your heartstrings. I wasn't aware of this tradition in China where people would not tell a loved one they're gonna die soon. I found it fascinating to learn about this practice and the actors do an amazing portraying the feelings they're going through. Awkwafina really surprised me here as I'm used to seeing her in comedic roles but with The Farewell she showed me her capabilities and range as an actress. Another standout was Shuzhen Zhao as Nai Nai in her feature film debut. She brought so much energy and life to the film making it all the more emotional.The film is certainly not perfect. There were some issues with pacing and the continuity during one dinner scene wasn't right but aside from that, The Farewell is an excellent film. There's so much heart to it and managed to make me feel homesick by the end. I'm definitely excited to see what Lulu Wang makes next!",The Farewell

Each character reemphasizes that they are larger than a sum of individuals, and instead that each of their lives ""is part of a whole."" Awkwafina does a good job as the lead, with a quiet but sad performance that consistently showed her internal struggle in how best to care for her grandmother. The Eastern and Western cultural comparisons were well done, and the movie was very funny. It's a strong script, though I did find a few moments where the transition from humor to seriousness both in the script and music was too abrupt. For such a short movie, it did feel a bit tedious by the end as nothing really beyond the basic paradox of helping your grandmother be happy by lying to her was developed. It's a good movie helped significantly by its funny script and strong emotional lead performance from Awkwafina.",The Farewell

65,sweidman-28016,The Most Impacting Film of the Year,10,8 August 2019,"The Farewell Review:The Farewell is written and directed by Lulu Wang and stars Awkwafina as Billi, a young woman who finds out from her parents that her grandmother is sick and only has a few months left to live. In Chinese tradition, it's common that the family doesn't tell one that they will die so they lie and say she's fine. In an act to all say their final goodbyes to Nai Nai, they plan a fake wedding to bring the family together. I love A24 films but I was especially interested in this. It seemed like a good story and the fact that it's based on Lulu Wang's life made me more interested in it. This film went to places emotionally that I did not expect. Based on the plot description I knew it would be sad, but I didn't expect it to also be a comedy to warm my heart. Surprisingly it's a pretty good comedy. There were scenes where everybody in the theater were laughing so much. Most of the comedy came from Shuzhen Zhao as Nai Nai. From my knowledge this is the first film she's ever been in and I hope people can recognize her talents as an actress. The whole film it did even feel like she was acting. It felt like she was the actual grandmother just thrown in the film. If she is not nominated for any awards I will loose it. She has the best performance of the year I've seen so far. Speaking of award winning performances, Awkwafina was stellar. It just amazes me that she wasn't really popular until last year. She starred in Ocean's 8 and that where most people discovered her. Then she's in Crazy Rich Asians and everybody knows and loves her. Now she's in her first drama film and getting Oscar buzz for her tragic performance. Behind Shuzhen Zhao, she's the second best performance by an actress that I've seen this year. Her contrasting mood throughout the film with Shuzhen made for an array of emotions. Their chemistry is perfect and for all that I knew that could've been her actual grandmother. I just didn't want the film to end because then I wouldn't see them together again. The emotions created with their scenes made me feel something that I haven't felt in a while. Yes, during Avengers: Endgame I did sob several times, but I wasn't really afraid to show it because everyone was feeling that way and we waited 10 years for that. With this everybody wanted to sob but we all held it in. There's no doubt that everyone at least shed a tear during it. I cried. It's films like those where it's a struggle to hold in emotions that I think do the best tonally. There were two scenes in particular that I think got everyone. There is no way to hold in the tears at the end. I won't spoil anything because everyone should go into this only knowing the main idea and nothing else. We should keep in mind that this is really a biopic about Lulu Wang just with different character names and they have differences within their lives. This is a film that a filmmaker needed to write out and show the world. Those films have the most meaning. We need more of those. It had so much to say about family and how different cultures live. There's even discussions about the differences between living in America vs China and what's better. In the end though we all have to remember our routes. Something I thought was pretty cool was the score by Alex Weston had a mix of traditional Chinese with a little bit of American styles. It was very good and I think one of the best recent scores. What's very surprising to me is that a film like this is rated PG. When I think of PG rated films lately I think of animated movies or a few adventure kids movies. This is technically a family film that has so much to say. I could just talk about the emotions, meaning, and just everything it has to say for a long time. There's absolutely more I could say but I would rather not spoil anything and just leave it at this. The Farewell is one of those films that impacts both the highest level of cinema and us in general. There is no way to go out of the theater and not feel somewhat changed with this. I have one recommendation and that is to watch this film with your family. I was lucky enough to see it with my grandmother, which I was planning on watching this for the first time with her, and I think that is a good way to view it.My Grade: A+",The Farewell

72,jayjaycee,Absurdly heartwarming tragicomedy,9,12 January 2021,"""The Farewell"" is a 2019 directed by Lulu Wang starring Shuzhen Zhao and Awkwafina.
⚪
All in all, Lulu Wang's unusual drama bids adieu to genre stereotypes and clichés and welcomes an unconventional approach instead by constructing a tricky tragicomedy that knows to strike the dramatic and the comedic keys equally sensitively, as well as to give a deep inside into the cultural differences of the family, and even if there is not really much of a twisted plot, the likeable characters, an always superbly balanced narration and excellent performances (especially by Awkwafina), make for a weirdly touching and absurdly heart-warming genre mix that knows to approach its difficult subject matter extremely carefully.
⚪
Since many of my fellow cinephiles seemingly appear to love this film and I wanted to watch more foreign films in general, tackling this highly acclaimed Chinese drama was some sort of inevitable. As I expected it no differently, this film was indeed an unconventional experience, and the only reason I am shocked it that it was completely snubbed at the Academy Awards that year. Like, why? This drama is anything but ordinary and hence doesn't fit the taste of everyone, but on the other hand it was downright refreshing, simple because you haven't seen something like that before (well, at least I didn't). The famous independent film company A24 (that now has made a lot of uniquely entertaining flicks) produced yet another title as unusual as most of its other works, but like with its other movies, I adored it so much. What makes it so special, though? After the family matriarch Nai Nai is diagnosed with cancer, the entire family returns to China to meet her for one last time before she passes away, but as unthoughtful as it sounds, it is anything but this. Apparently, it is some sort of Chinese tradition to not tell people that they are terminally ill, so as an excuse for the family to suddenly visit the grandma, an impromptu wedding is scheduled summarily. The thing is, there isn't much happening in this film, there is no actual plot and no unexpected events. They all come visit her, have some fun with her, than there is the fake wedding, and then they already leave again. Sounds boring? In general, it would definitely be dull as hell, but it is how the minimalistic plot is dealt with what is nothing short of utterly amazing. All members of the clan are scattered all around the world: protagonist Billi and her parents have taken up residence in New York City, her uncle and her wife have settled in Japan and the rest of the family are still living somewhere in China, but most of the time Nai Nai was alone (except for her supportive sister and the caretaker). So, it has been ages since the whole family has been sitting at the same table, and everyone evolved entirely different. Aside from communication problems, the clash of cultures is the main problem of the film, since every household adapted to their respective society. Even if it does sounds macabre to Billi (and to me as well), it is some sort of custom to keep the dying person in the dark about their fate, and the struggle to accept this bitter truth is what makes this film so utterly interesting. Albeit being a drama in its core, there is still this superb poise of emotions that defines everything. In an extremely careful manner, director Lulu Wang manages to balance between moving drama and heart-warming comedy. Seriously, even though it felt sort of inappropriate to do so, I laughed multiple times, as the situations really allowed it (hint: grave visit). It gives a deep insight into the traditions of China, and with enormous respect, it points out the importance as well as the hilariousness of some things - and it is just touching all the time. What makes this film even more affecting are the main characters. Despite not being masterfully elaborated, it suffices in every single case, and in the end, I surprisingly ended up liking them all. Furthermore, in terms of performances the movie is pretty solid as well, with only one exception. Awkwafina, who I have previously known by name only, is nothing like the rest of the cast ... because she is absolutely amazing. The emotional range she displays is undoubtedly mesmerizing and astonished me out of nowhere. She plays her character Billi, a strong and independent woman, with such genuineness and ease, it is a shame that she wasn't considered for any acting Oscar. Seriously, she is that great! In the end, I have had an enormous pleasure watching this film, and I am glad that everyone recommended it to me. Yes, the plot isn't really the crucial factor as to why it works out so well, but the sensitivity it displays in everything it deals with. Not many dramedies manage to sway between sad and funny like this film does, and that deserves my respect. An absurdly touching and heart-warming gem, indeed.",The Farewell
73,WalkdenEntertainment,Saying Farewell is Never Simple...,8,14 January 2020,"Billi (Awkwafina) is a Chinese woman living in America. While failing to pay her rent and being turned down for a Fellowship, Billi finds out that her Grandma is dying of lung cancer. Billi also discovers that Grandma (Nai Nai) is unaware that she is dying. Her family have made the decision to keep Nai Nai in the dark in regards to her health and sickness. Now Billi's family will travel to China to see their Grandma for one last time, but Billi is told by her family members to never reveal the truth. Billi is to pretend that everything is normal in regards to her Grandma's health. As you would expect, Billi's biggest challenge is to confront Nai Nai and pretend like nothing is wrong. Billi's Grandma is also surrounded by many other family members who also know the truth.The Farewell has a number of actors playing the family surrounding the Grandma. The performances for each character are rather strong and believable, in particular from Awkwafina who plays the character of Billi.The film's plot is extremely touching, even more so when the film claimed at the start that this movie is based on an ""actual lie"". It didn't take me long to get invested in this film and for the whole duration I was hoping certain characters would make the right choices or that the Grandma would discover the truth about her sickness at some point. Once I started this film, I had to see it to the end.While The Farewell personally showed me many emotions, I couldn't help but think about my own family, past and present. When a film makes you feel and think like that, it's an extremely positive experience. I will also confess to fans, I even teared up unexpectedly at one point too (that's the power of actress Awkwafina- well done).Overall, The Farewell is a touching story that was able to grab my heart strings. With wonderful performances from all actors (especially Awkwafina), this film had me invested from the start. Not only that, this film was even able to get me thinking about my own family members, past and present. When a movie can make you feel and think about family and feel emotions, it's an extremely positive experience. Recommended.8.5/10

74,dommercaldi,A Beautiful Delve Into Identity And Familial Dynamics,9,22 July 2020,"Pros:
1. The beautiful score, with its distinctly Chinese flavour, packs heaps of emotion into the film and it really helps the viewer to feel said emotions.
2. The scaled-back cinematography allows the viewer to focus in on the events taking place, as well as providing for some beautifully simplistic shots.
3. The comedy is dry and witty, it feels organic, and is well-timed.
4. There are incredible performances by Awkwafina (Billi), Shuzhen Zhao (Nai Nai), Tzi Ma (Haiyan), and Yongbo Jiang (Uncle Haibin).
5. The movie presents compelling commentary on the importance of ethnicity and identity, especially between the native Chinese and the Chinese-Americans, which is summed up in the heated debate around the dinner table, as well as the comparisons made between Eastern and Western philosophy.
6. The tender and heartfelt moments are delivered powerfully which mean they land tremendously, as well as causing you to analyse your own familial dynamics.
7. The dialogue is thought-provoking, mesmerising, in addition to being grounded and raw.Cons:
1. Some of the scenes are prolonged a little too long.",The Farewell

76,TheVictoriousV,In loving memory of Nai Nai.,8,14 February 2020,"Like the cinematic nincompoop I routinely accuse others of being, I missed out on Lulu Wang's family drama The Farewell when composing my 2019 list, although since its theatrical release in my country was last month, I am confident I will mention it in some capacity on my 2020 list. I don't know that I responded as strongly to this story as others did, mainly due to sharing little in common with its Chinese and Chinese-American main characters. However, things have been happening in my family life that make me understand ""the lie"" quite well.Some have complained that one understands the message of The Farewell pretty early, but this needn't be a problem. I have a friend who loved Parasite even though they already knew ""the point"" beforehand - because, y'know, the movie is very entertaining. Although, the alleged problem with The Farewell is that the theme (whether you knew of it beforehand or not) already feels fully punctuated somewhere around Act 2.Awkwafina (again, what a name) plays New York-based aspiring writer Billi Wang. She is told that her beloved grandmother, her ""Nai Nai"" (played by Zhao Shu-zhen), has been struck with terminal cancer - something that the rest of the family has elected not to make Nai Nai aware of.Sort of a black sheep within her tribe, Billi is ordered by her parents (Tzi Ma and Diana Lin) to remain in America while they go to Changchun, where the entire family, Nai Nai included, is soon to be gathered for the wedding of Billi's cousin. However, Billi soon makes it to the assembly as well. And bear in mind, she is not as on board with the lie as everyone else. You can imagine what sort of tension rises.I will say, for starters, that the movie looks great, with lovely color schemes for the sets, costumes, and props (there is quite a bit of blue, which I initially assumed was a mere beauty preference, although it isn't irrelevant to the central questions that the color is often used to represent loyalty and truth), all of it well-shot. The actors succeed in creating believable persons, Awkwafina being the most strikingly natural of the bunch.The movie was distributed in America by A24 and they continue to supply the more original stories of the year. And as Bong Joon-ho was taught by Scorsese (see Bong's Oscar speech), it is the most personal stories which are the most creative. Sometimes writers of fiction cannot compete with true stories, and The Farewell is based on Lulu Wang's real-life experiences - as it turns out, sparing the old and infirm the burden of knowing their demise (dishonest as it may seem) is common practice in China; it is seen as an act of kindness.So then, this is both a personal tale and a funny-yet-poignant showcase of a culture I know little about, yet it's also the sort of movie I think anyone will relate to. Most of us have had, or met, a granny like Nai Nai. What would we do if only we knew her fate?I do take issue with a few inessential moments (so they seemed to me, at least) and continuity errors during a dinner table scene that wouldn't be a bother if they weren't so in-your-face. The teleporting items are in full-view and the conversation is long; this could have been avoided. And sure, perhaps the movie drags a touch after we get to what seems like the ""in conclusion"" section. What of it? The movie remains touching (when it isn't relatable in more comical ways) and nevertheless leaves us with something to think about. Even this guy (who, as one might grasp from my article ""A layman's thought on Objectivism"", ain't the biggest fanboy of pro-collectivism edicts).",The Farewell
77,carlos37andre,Awkwafina is a star,9,2 January 2020,"The movie is great. It feels real (probably because it is), the directing, the screenplay and the acting is amazing all throughout. And it's an awesome experience for people in the west, to kind of get to know a little bit about China's culture, and how it is drastically different when you compared it with any western country.But man, the star of the movie is Awkwafina, she is fantastic, I had only seen her in smaller roles so far (Crazy Rich Asians and Ocean's 8), but man, here he is the magnet that holds the movie together beautifully. Fantastic performance. Chinese actress Shuzhen Zhao is also really good as Nai Nai here, and their chemistry together is perfect, since the first scene in the movie you buy their love for one and other, and it plays out great throughout the movie as the plot goes on.If I had to say something I didn't like about it, even though the cinematography is gorgeous, some style decisions made on a fell scenes feel... weird. And there are a couple of extra minutes that probably didn't need to be there in the third act. But that's about it, the movie is short anyways, so it doesn't affect the experience at all.To wrap up, The Farewell is a powerful and touching story, with amazing performances, and a great screenplay. Definitely one of my favorites 2019 movies to date.",The Farewell

80,stimpy_tr,Weak screenplay...,5,30 January 2020,"I had some expectations after seeing the rating of this movie. It is classified as comedy and drama. However, I had difficulty distinguishing the genre of this movie while watching it. Frankly, I had difficulty understanding the Chinese humour. The jokes and dialogues are shallow and not funny at all. The acting is below average.Generally, the importance of family unity in the eastern culture was underlined. But this is not sufficient to make a good movie. The behaviours of Billi and Nai Nai are irrational. You cannot mourn for someone that you have last seen when you were 6-years old. Nai Nai, on the other hand, looks healthier than anyone else in the movie. Screenplay is so poor, I was dragged into boredom. Stop pumping up the rating and nominating it to awards. I believe there are much better Chinese movies.",The Farewell
81,PotassiumMan,Subtly anguished portrait of a family coping with tragedy,8,18 August 2019,"Awkwafina stars as a young Asian-American professional woman in this down-to-earth, insightful film about a Chinese family that confronts the discovery of an aging grandmother being diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer. The family is determined to not tell the grandmother about her condition so as to allow her the best state of mind as she lives out the remainder of her life.Tremendous performances make this film, which would not be the same achievement without the acting that makes these characters utterly real, without judging them or resorting to weepy melodrama. In addition, there is the theme of a clash of views between Asian-Americans who have learned western values and the long-standing traditional values of Chinese families. There is also a contrast in backdrops, with Awkwafina's protagonist's laid-back lifestyle at home in New York compared to the sterile, concrete character of China.Although the film has a comedic element with Awkwafina at the helm, this is more a slow-burn film about the psychological toll of impending family loss. It is never overdone and there are no cheap tears here. This film, in the end, earns its emotional impact. I don't cry watching a film, but I came close here. For patient viewers, this will is a must-see. Gladly recommended.",The Farewell

The whole family decides to not tell her that she is going to pass away soon. She has troubles doing what the family wants to do.I enjoyed this film. It was a really solid and enjoyable film. It was funny and also hit you in the heart. The acting was the key thing that helped make that happen. Akwafina gave a performance I didn't think she could give. I have only seen her as a person that make a joker or two but in this picture she was funny, but also she had some pretty solid emotional scenes. The whole family I thought did a solid job as acting. The thing that helped that out had to be the story. It gave all of the characters depths that made them feel relatable and like real family members. Also, the story was really fascinating. I never knew that most families in China don't tell one of there family members that they are getting towards the end of there life. I thought that was a little weird because I don't know how you won't figure out that you are going to die, but it did teach me something. The only thing I didn't like was this one wedding scene that felt like it wasn't ending. They just kept doing many things and it kind of got boring after a while.Overall, The Farewell was a fantastic film and probably one of the best of the year. I would definitely recommend it.",The Farewell
84,Golden_Hope,It Will Break Your Heart but Will Leave You Wanting More,7,21 May 2020,I don't really know how I can describe the feeling I felt at the end of the movie. It is heartbreaking especially one of the later shots but you kind of feel like you need more resolution or more of an end.And I know films don't always need a clear cut beginning and end but I just felt like the characters didn't really grow or change. Like I felt we ended exactly where we started the film. Like nothing changed.One more negative thing was the tone seemed a bit all over the shop. Very sad scenes would play out and then it would drop the dramatic effect for comedy and it just didn't seem to flow very well into each other. And some sequences just seemed like they belonged in entirely different movies like The Hangover or something. It was kind of strange.I actually enjoyed this movie believe it or not. You could tell it was lovingly made and was so personal. Awkwafina was great and so was Shuzhen Zhao. The films was best when them two were sharing scenes together. They made you feel how much the characters cared for each other.The score was also quite haunting. It fit the sombreness of the movie.So I would say you could watch it but you need to be in the right mood as it can get pretty sad.,The Farewell
85,bastille-852-731547,Thoughtful Analysis of the Intersection of Eastern and Western Culture,7,10 August 2019,"This bittersweet comedy follows a Chinese family to throw a surprise wedding as a means of trying to hide from their grandmother the fact that she has terminal cancer. It's a very well-made and often beautiful film, but it's not quite as great as some of the critics praising it to the high heavens are saying. On the positive side, the film's ensemble cast is incredibly strong. Viewers are able to genuinely feel for and relate to the different members of the family, who each also manage to break down negative American stereotypes of Chinese people. Their interactions seem uniquely genuine, and they are all developed as characters on a level that most viewers--irrespective of personal cultural or ethnic background--should be able to relate to almost universally to some degree. The grandmother, Nai Nai, is an outstanding character, and Awkwafina's portrayal of her granddaughter (who lives in New York City) is also quite stirring. First-time director Lulu Wang also shows a potent and commanding vision for the technical aspects of her craft, with superb cinematography of urban China and such associated sights and sounds. The film is often funny in a bittersweet way without ever feeling overdone or trying too hard, which I also appreciate.While the main plot of ""The Farewell"" is interesting and serves as a sort of superglue to hold the narrative together, it is also (regrettably) somewhat of a limiting aspect of the film. While the film is well-paced and the juxtaposition of the various scenes of the family attempting to conceal information about Nai Nai's expected fate never seems problematic, it also begins to make the story seem a bit more contrived. The film does a good job at comparing the differences in values and society between the West and China, but I feel that the fact that the plot gets somewhat more contrived as it goes on ends up mildly harming the impact that such commentary on cultural differences could have had in the film. Despite those concerns, however, this is a generally well-made film and most definitely a strong directorial debut from Wang. 7/10",The Farewell
86,eelen-seth,A tragically beautiful story that makes you homesick,8,10 September 2019,"Lulu Wang's story of an independent Chinese-American woman returning to China when her beloved grandmother is diagnosed with terminal cancer, is nothing less but captivating. From the very first shot inside a hospital, the director invites you to tag along with this Chinese family, while they struggle to keep the truth from grandma and decide to stage a wedding, just to see her one last time.Billi (Awkwafina), a twenty-something millennial, lives her life like most New Yorkers do - barely able to pay rent and on the lookout for a new job, she still goes home to mom and dad to do her laundry, knowing well enough she'll have to endure the parental comments while under the same roof. When her mother (Diana Lin) announces the imminent wedding of Billi's cousin, she realises something isn't right. Pressured by Billi's suspicion, her parents quickly confess to the terminal state her grandma Nai Nai (Zhao Shuzhen) is in. Shocked by the news, it doesn't take long before they all end up around the dinner table at Nai Nai back in China, faking their true feelings around the clock.Wang knows how to direct this tragically heartfelt story in a way not only Chinese families can relate. I, for one, could definitely look back at how my family used to keep secrets from certain relatives, just to ""protect"" them. Billi's family has problems of their own, with underlying tensions waiting to rise to the surface, and no one is holding back.Anna Franquesa Solano's cinematography is a beauty. Most of the time, it's as if you're walking through an art gallery - strolling past one lifelike portrait after another. Truly exquisite is the way she captures the feelings of each individual. The vulnerability and sadness in their eyes, conflict with the constant ""joie-de-vivre"" the old Nai Nai still has going for her.Everyone knows how good Awkwafina is at comedy, but who knew she'd be able to peel off every layer of that mask, to get to the core of her vulnerable emotions? She and Shuzhen are two peas in a pod, when it comes to giving groundbreaking performances. Shuzhen touches you in a way you can't imagine. An old lady with a big heart and a big mouth, keeping traditions alive while holding her own family together. The gloominess of her diagnosis lingers like a storm, which transcends into a mostly ominous score by Alex Weston.With The Farewell, A24 can add another classic to their collection, which will go down in the history books as a turning point for Awkwafina and Lulu Wang's careers. A tragically beautiful story that makes you homesick and wants you to hold on to what we sometimes take for granted. Coming home has never felt more therapeutic.",The Farewell
87,cadillac20,"A Heart Wrenching Story of White Lies, Culture, and the Importance of Saying Goodbye",9,22 July 2019,"The trailer for The Farewell immediately struck a cord with me because it dealt with a topic that resonates with me emotionally, that being the subject of goodbyes. There's something about the act of saying goodbye to someone or something that often goes unnoticed, but I think is relatable for everyone. Even more so than loss, we are all touched possibly more by not being able to give off a proper farewell. Whether it's a story we never get the ending to, or someone we never get the chance to say goodbye to, being able to say goodbye to someone or something is possibly one of the most important actions we can take. The Farewell deals with this subject, as well as others, intimately. This could have been an ultra serious, sappy, melodramatic affair that manipulates it's audience emotionally, but the film turns into a surprisingly humorous, grounded, and natural film that uses it's comparisons of culture to great effect.Billi, as played by Awkwafina, is a young Chinese woman living in New York who finds out her grandmother is possibly terminally ill. Making the trek to China under the guise of a wedding, Billi, along with her family, attempt to put on a happy face while keeping their matriarch's illness a secret from her. Billi finds herself struggling with this aspect of her family's culture, versus the traditional, western way of dealing with impending death in the family. Awkwafina shines here as Billi, doing an excellent job of not only conveying profound emotion, while at the same time having to hide that emotion, but also of giving us a character that has other troubles. She struggles at home, struggles with her parents, and struggles financially, all of which she tries to put on a brave face about. While we're used to seeing Awkwafina play more comedic roles, from her early career as a comedic rapper to her more energetic and playful film roles, here she completely flips the usual script as a down to earth, highly relatable young woman trying to make sense of both the situation with her grandmother and her own life. She is surrounded by a great supporting cast, most notably by Shuzhen Zhou, who is spirited, funny, and charming, despite her families mopey nature.While the film could easily delve into topics of mortality, death, and other slightly morbid subjects, it instead chooses to focus on things surrounding the topic of death that are less explored. It is through these topics that the film branches into the larger subject of the lies we tell each other for fear of troubling those around us, or perhaps to simply keep from having to take on an emotional burden. It's biggest story stems from the cultural difference between what we might do here in the U.S., or in western culture, versus Chinese culture's understanding of death and how it's treated. Billi struggles to reconcile with the idea that the knowledge of death is withheld from her grandmother so as to alleviate the emotional burden, which is on the family, until a time close to death. It's an emotionally powerful idea because it asks questions about the importance of goodbye and whether or not it is better for someone to live in ignorance of their impending fate, or if it is better for them to know so that they may say their farewells to others. While we're quick to judge, the film makes a case for the opposite side of the argument.The film also deals with the topic of lying, and it isn't just about the subject of death. From the first scene, amidst a phone conversation between Billi and her grandmother, the two lie to each other in small ways. It's clear these are white lies in an attempt to keep the other from worrying, but lying happens throughout the film between various characters. It's never examined implicitly whether these lies are good or bad, a lie is a lie, and the film argues for bother sides. But it is interesting that the film examines just how often we might lie to each other, whether it's about needing help, quitting smoking, or even death. Whether good or bad, big or small, these lies can have an impact not only on our own lives, but on the lives of those around us. These ideas the film conveys are wonderfully supported by technical film making that feels intimate and muted. It's cinematography tends to focus on close ups, making us feel close to our characters and their emotional struggles, while the music channels the somber mood.The Farewell is a beautiful film showcasing a stellar performance from Awkwafina, who makes her leap into being a leading lady and dramatic actor. For anyone who has ever had to say goodbye to someone, or has ever missed the opportunity to do so, the film should resonate with them. It's emotionally charged, but not overpowering or cheap. It, thankfully, doesn't manipulate them into feeling the way they do, coming across progressively naturally and bringing up thought provoking questions for it's audience to ponder well after the credits.",The Farewell

I say that because many people praise the script for some reason, despite it being very basic and familiar. This isn't a bad movie, just very ""been there, done that"" (the premise of a family keeping a secret from their matriarch reminds me of 'Good Bye, Lenin!', a German movie a thousand times better than this), with very little, if anything at all, to distinguish it from your typical run-of-the-mill Edward Yang or Ang Lee family soap opera. The plot is very basic (American returns to ancestral homeland and bonds with extended family) and the wedding scene vaguely took me back to Crazy Rich Asians (a movie I can't stand). There. I covered all the bases. It's a movie so bland, I seriously struggle to say anything about it.

The title of the film in in the italian version is flanked by the phrase ""a lie for good"" and everything is explained in this sentence. Lulu Wang's work revolves around a lie and the psychological consequences of the characters and their first characterization followed by a second and final one that the lie itself causes. Everything is directed with simplicity and skill, capturing the nuances of a well-rooted culture in a casual chinese family where there is also the theme of immigration and their values absorbed and merged by other cultures. The film succeeds in this message, manages to convey emotions and fictitiously by its own representation of the farewell. A masterpiece of a lie.",The Farewell

There was a particular line about the difference between the East and the West as families operate -- how Easterners prioritize the greater good while Westerners are more selfish. The lie that this whole story is based on (a funny opening line to the movie) is suffering the family endures to appreciate their last moments with an authentic Nanay.
I loved the many raw family moments in this movie. They never felt forced nor too scripted. The awkwardness and discomfort is just how a lot of families are when they get together after a long period of separation. Everyone is off making a way. This film is a pleasant reminder of the duty we owe our families and the unavoidable, indelible mark they will always have on us.",The Farewell
95,manuel_medeiros,"It's dramedy done right, one of the best movies of 2019",9,7 July 2020,"The Farewell was one of 2019's film vintage best surprises. The premise of Lulu Wang's second feature film is triggered by the oldest member of the chinese family, grandmother Nai Nai, receiving a cancer diagnosis, with the doctors estimating she has only 3 months to live. Most of the family agrees to hide the diagnosis from their matriarch, thanks in part to a Chinese saying - ""when people get cancer, they die"" - suggesting many people die not necessarily from the disease itself, but from the fear of living with it.The film focuses on one of Nai Nai's descendents, granddaughter Bili - played brilliantly by Awkwafina - who isn't particularly convinced that lying to her grandmother is the best course of action.Why is the movie so great?It is a great take on family and griefBased on ""real lie"", as the movie puts it, the plot launches a discussion about what is the best course of action when faced with an impending death, but equally exposes the importance of family and looks at the different ties between these family members.
The different relationships are very moving and built on believable characters, rather than cliches. The same goes for the depiction of grief, which ranges from denial to emotional outburst - and not one resorts to the easy tear-jerking moment we have seen many times againIt nails comedy when it needs toComedic moments come only from very pertinent conversation or family interactions, in a way that's incredibly natural to the narrative. There's a particular scene - let's say over a family drinking game to avoid spoilers - which is genius, and hilarious.
But throughout the movie, the dialogues are very well constructed, and even when discussing US vs. America (as some family members live in the US) it does not get in any way political. It portrays well the discussion in a informal settingAwkwafina's and the overall cast performanceShe was a very worthy winner of the Golden Globe for Best Actress. After a career as an hip hop artist and on the screen with wackyer roles - Nora from Queens, Crazy Rich Asians - Awkwafina really nails the more nuanced role of Bili. Not only because she opposes somewhat the family's decision to omit Nai Nai's diagnosis, but because she effectively a great vehicle for Western audiences - her character was also raised in New York for most of her life, and we can see through her eyes as well a side of Chinese culture most of us are oblivious to.The 7.6 rating (at time of writing) can only be attributed to the Average Joe's unwillingness to watch movies with subtitles - although in this case it is 50% in English.This family drama has moments of true comedic relief with outstanding actors and is a great film overall, which should have been an Oscar contender, especially in the Original Screenplay category.",The Farewell

97,cappiethadog,Girl in translation,10,28 November 2019,"Nai Nai(Zhao Shuzhen) lives. It's a twist ending worthy of M. Night Shyamalan. After the filmic narrative fades to black, the audience sees documentary footage of Nai Nai's real life counterpart, and that's when the ""he's dead"" moment appears in the postscript. The filmmaker's grandmother defied her physician's diagnosis of three-months-to-live into six years and counting. ""The Farewell"", directed by Lulu Wang, is a well-calibrated tearjerker with an unexpected happy ending, albeit a fluid one. This octogenarian dynamo could die tomorrow and render the postscript obsolete. But for the time being, she's not a ghost like her dead husband, smoking a cigarette near the window of their granddaughter's lonely hotel room. If Wang marries her current beau, a filmmaker of high regard, Nai Nai will be able to attend the wedding, because sometimes life is stranger than fiction. Billi(Awakafina), Wang's stand-in, puts on a poker face, coercing the tears away, when Nai Nai talks about the scope of her plans for her granddaughter's wedding reception, bigger than the one she made for Yuping(Zhang Jing), the cousin from Japan. In that moment, Billi, a stranger in a strange homeland, learns what it means to be Chinese, carrying out the lesson laid down by Uncle Haibin(Jiang Yongho). Even Haiyan(Tzi Ma), Billi's father, needed to be purged of his learned western bias, sounding like an ugly America at the hospital as he explains to Haiban, a Japanese emigrant, how lying about a diagnosis in the States would be illegal. Billi stands there and absorbs the burden of her grandmother's stage four cancer, just like she was taught, because in China, family takes precedence over the individual, so a good lie is not a lie; it's an irony-free emotional truth. Mistaken as a joke, back in NYC, Lu Jian(Diana Lin) tells her daughter: ""Chinese people have saying: When you get cancer, you die."" Something gets lost in the translation from English to Mandarin. Billi sees the gap between both languages and culture. From being an unwilling participant in this Chinese tradition, fooling the terminally ill, she becomes the ringleader, taking it upon herself to intercept Nai Nai's test results when she overhears an aside between aging sisters. Little Nai Nai(Lu Hong), Billi's great aunt, doesn't have to dispatch the American to the hospital. She knows what to do after the group photo is taken.Running right to left(or east to west) on the sidewalk in a tracking shot, the filmmaker, in miniature, tells Billi's story of moving to the states with her parents as a six-year-old child. The hospital, like New York, is a far-off destination from the restaurant and China, respectively. It was exhausting, the run and the move, both, indicated by Billi doubling over, and earlier, back at the hotel, when she muses over the loneliness and isolation of being, suddenly, a nuclear family, to her mother. It's off-camera, but the audience can gauge that Billi and Aunty Gao(Hong Liu), the maid, met Little Nai Nai at the copy shop by walking left to right(or west to east), as a metaphor for homecoming and reintegration, indicated through her complicity in the duplicitous, but kind act, of forging x-ray results. ""Benign shadow"", quite pointedly, is a western term that the forger doesn't understand; it's a pointed term since Billi's eastern self can be deemed as a benign shadow of her western persona, which the naturalized ""other"" keeps subjugated. She's a liar, but the mistruth that the ""other"" perpetuates won't kill Nai Nai. Good actors all, the family gathers around the dining room table and looks properly worried as the matriarch reads a fake clean bill of health. Mission accomplished. Fear eats the soul, the Chinese believe, so the healthy souls eat the fear for the soul that can't digest the terror. Billi gets it now. The next shot, a family walking towards the camera in slow-motion is a juxtaposition of Billi walking alone at the same altered camera speed. In another country, she can be another person, a familial link in a collective, not a girl who can take care of herself; a girl flying solo, just like the sparrow who follows Billi from America to China, looking for its flock in a hotel room lit by flashing neon and downtown lights.Nai Nai is ""blessed"" with not just one, but two sons, and yet Haiyin and Haiban left the continent, in direct dereliction of their government-mandated duty to look after the elderly. Ling(Xiang Li), the niece, takes care of their mother while both boys live as disconnected individuals in different countries without ever having looked through the rearview mirror, until now, when it's seemingly too late. At the wedding reception, as the elder son, Haiyin speaks on behalf of his younger brother, Billi's father, and apologizes to Nai Nai for abandoning her. It's been over two decades since the whole family was together. Does it bother? Yes. The acting goes both ways. Nai Nai is weak in body, but strong in mind; she knows that Haiyin and Haiban abandoned her. At the cemetery, in a long shot, the two sisters speak among themselves in one part of the frame, while the other group, in another part of the frame, and like eavesdroppers, the audience hears what is out of range for the family, having their own separate conversation. This isn't a Robert Altman film. There is no overlapping dialogue. The audience doesn't miss the latent anger in Nai Nai's voice. Benevolent prayers notwithstanding, after they part ways with her husband's tombstone, the matriarch tells Little Nai Nai to just scatter her ashes in the ocean, since nobody is ever home anyway. For good reason, the filmmaker forgoes a reaction shot of the recipient of Haiyin's heartfelt tribute. The audience knows that her sons are sorry, but perhaps, to the mother, sorry isn't enough. His tears, from Nai Nai's perspective are crocodile tears, the bread and butter of professional criers.""Not reallly,"" Rebecca(Rebecca Hall) answers, when a well-wisher at the funeral calls Andra(Ann Guilbert) ""a lovely woman"". The old lady was mean-spirited; she always said the wrong things in polite company, a real curmudgeon, but when Rebecca was fifteen and Mary(Amanda Peet), her sister, was seventeen, their mother swallowed a whole bottle of pills, and Andra took the orphaned girls in. Nicole Holofcener's ""Please Give"" is about many things, but above all else, it's about unconditional love. Rebecca could have stuck her awful grandmother into a nursing home, live her life, and just let nature run its course. Rebecca wasn't bound by law to be Andra's caregiver. She gave, without her grandmother having to say please. It's a girl, Billi, who speaks the loudest about staying back and taking care of Nai Nai, before her mother, Americanized just like the father, puts a stop to such selflessness. Neither Haiyan, nor his elder brother, are willing to give up their privileged lives and do what Chinese boys are supposed to do; give...back.Does Nai Nai know she's dying? Most likely, yes. The lie, she knows, gives both boys an excuse to go home. If either son stayed back, and actually fulfilled their familial duty, their mother would know something was wrong. The way Nai Nai says goodbye to Billi, you can tell that the old lady thinks that this will be, in all likelihood, the last time she'll hold her most precious resource; a girl.""The Farewell"" has a dark side. It's a celebration of life, sure, but it's also about traditional eastern values, Chinese, in particular, being compromised by western values, chiefly and ironically, the individual taking precedence over the collective.",The Farewell
98,qqml,Touching and inspiring movie,7,10 February 2020,"The director certainly never went to hospital in China. An English speaking doctor who care barely speak Chinese in a local community Red Star Hospital. That being said, the actors/actresses' acting is good, and the movie is touching and inspiring. We have many difficulties to overcome in our life.",The Farewell
99,chong_an,Don't Tell Her (Chinese title),6,22 July 2019,"Billi emigrated from China to the U.S. with her parents at age 6, but has kept in close touch by phone with her grandmother (known as Nai Nai). 25 years later, she is shocked to find her parents going back to China for the wedding of her cousin (another branch of the family who emigrated to Japan), but Billi is not invited because she is ""too busy"". It turns out that Nai Nai has been diagnosed with lung cancer, and has a short time to live. However, all interactions with doctors go thru Nai Nai's younger sister (Little Nai Nai), who is keeping Nai Nai in the dark, but has arranged the wedding as an excuse for the family to get together. Billi is excluded because she might spill the beans.Billi makes her way to Nai Nai anyway, where various members of the family warn / bully her to keep quiet. Some are perfectly happy with the lie, on the basis that the family should bear the burden of bad news rather than the sick person. Others are less sure, but go along with it - Billi's father mentions that this would be illegal America (presumably patient's rights). Some have a hard time dealing with it, including the groom.I am not happy with the premise of the movie for several reasons.With limited western exposure to Chinese culture, the writer / director is casting all Chinese as pathological liars, when my impression that the ""white lie"" was the prerogative of white people, as viewed from TV's Modern Family. When we 1st see Nai Nai, she is on her cell phone talking to Billi, in a hospital waiting room waiting for her CT scan, but she tells Billi she is elsewhere (not in hospital).One line of dialogue was ""In China, when you get cancer, you die"". In modern China, there should be therapies that can prolong life, and it should be up to the patient to decide on what therapy to take (or not). It would be difficult to treat patients without their knowledge of what they were being treated for.Finally, Nai Nai has a strong personality. She insists on a big wedding banquet (even though the bride and groom haven't known each other for long), and also to take care of the details (she is furious when her order for lobster was replaced with crab). It seems strange that she would let her sister deal with the doctors, even as her cough worsens and she goes back to hospital for a change in pills.I would have preferred a story where the dying knows the truth, and is dealing with it - something like Beginners or It's My Party.",The Farewell

Today the day came and I regret not having seen it before, it has a presentation and outcome that seems slow but in reality there are small details that make this story unique as this family.Things I liked:
The color palette makes photography look like pictures of our contemporary society is something of the most beautiful.The scenes are all well done, apart from the fact that the dialogues capable are not super strong, they were not necessary when seeing the anguish that each character handled and how each one faced it.Awkwafina pleasantly surprises me with a simple performance but full of anguish and emotion. Shuzhen Zhao is also full of innocence and strength in this grandmother who they hide a great secret from herself. Diana Lin of the best of the secondary cast bringing this superb mother and seeks lawsuits at times.I was very pleased to see the cultural clash between the western and eastern, without going as a supporter of which is wrong but making visible why both are valid.

The film had no plot. What was the Hype? We didn't get it. At least with 'the farewell' there is a plot and a dark comedy one at that-the cultural practice of not telling someone when they're dying because knowing might kill them faster. This might sound like an absurd theory but I as a disabled person as well Can see the logic. What you don't know can't hurt you. One of the more interesting aspects of this film is that it touched on points that were touched in 'crazy rich Asians' (another film I didn't get the hype but not the point) it basically deals with putting on a happy face and not reacting, something someone in 'crazy rich asians' Does And basically gets chastised for. (DONT want to ruin for those who haven't seen the film) anyway it was nice to see it was not a stereotype but an actual cultural thing. I really liked how it was explored how that cultural norm can take its toll on someone not used to it. We see that with awkafina's character carrying that burden of keeping quiet when she feels it's morally wrong. The film is not for everyone. It still takes it time telling the story and some may find that too slow, but the premise was enough to keep me intrigued the whole way.",The Farewell

106,Kirollos-Noah,A great cultural movie!,8,17 November 2019,"""Based on an actual lie"" that quote is capable of making lots of people on board from the very beginning of this film!The Farewell is written and directed by Lulu Wang, and starring Shuzhen Zhao, Awkwafina and X Mayo.The film follows a Chinese family who, when they discover their beloved Grandmother has only a short while left to live, decide to keep her in the dark and schedule an impromptu wedding to gather before she passes. Billi, feeling like a fish out of water in her home country, struggles with the family's decision to hide the truth from her grandmother.I wasn't so excited to see The Farewell, I haven't even seen the trailer, but I saw Blu-Ray preview and I thought that this might actually be a good movie, and it was! The Farewell is such a great, beautiful and sweet movie, and what makes this movie really works that it doesn't focus on the farewell only, but it discuses some other cultural themes, and that what makes this movie really works, that it has so many other things to do besides it's main storyline.The Farewell is beautifully shot, Wang did a great job with this movie, MOST of the movie was shot flawlessly! Each scene was combined with amazing soundtrack, and that made this movie so saddening sometimes, and I guess that was the message from this movie, to discuss a true tradition that Chinese people used/or use to do, and it gets to your heart so quickly, because you kinda feel for them, and Wang directed this movie in a way that will make feel for them so quickly.You'll find yourself crying at least once during this movie, no matter how tough you're, it's hard not to cry throughout this movie, part of it because of the amazing OST and Wang's amazing long scenes and build up, but most of it because of the acting; everyone in this movie did an amazing job, there're no exception, because everyone did his role perfectly, and they showed emotions like if it was a real life documentary, their acting didn't feel like acting, it was so real and that's why it was so heart-touching!This movie is not only sad, it was funny from time to time, and that gave the movie an even more realistic theme, because life isn't always sad, even in their situation they found a way to add some laughs, and that worked very well, because a movie like this needs a little bit of a positive energy to move forward, Wand understood that perfectly, and she made a great combination between real-life cultural themes, with some slight humor.This movie isn't just about the Chinese culture, it's not just relatable to the Chinese people only, though it does that for the most part of this movie, but it also did a great job comparing the Chinese culture to our American culture, it was only shown in a couple of scenes only, but I'm so glad that they did that! Also the movie has some relatable themes, either you are Chinese, or American.. or whatever your nationality is, the movie has something else than those themes too, and I won't spoil it for you, because it wasn't shown in any of the trailers, but what I would say about it is ""Home is where the heart is"", people who watched this movie will get what I mean, and the movie discusses THAT in a great way, deep and emotional!The movie's not flawless by any means, don't get me wrong, it's not a perfect movie or anything, we'll get to that in a minute, but a movie like that isn't easy to hate, that's what I would say, so before I get into flaws, if you haven't seen The Farewell go check it out, it definitely worth a look.When it comes to flaws I think this movie has some dull scenes, for instance there's a scene where Billi and her uncle were walking down the street and he was telling what she should do and what she shouldn't do, and went telling her the same things over and over again, I don't know if it was meant to be funny or not, but it was kinda long.There's also a scene where the main family was playing games at a wedding, it was also long, and unnecessary... Some other scenes were like this, long and unnecessary scenes, though the movie is 98 minutes only, there're some scenes that could have been cut from the movie, and they're not few for a 98 minutes movie!The build-up of this movie was well-crafted, the first and the third act were amazingly crafted, but the second act kinda drag a little, it took a few turns that only made the movie longer, and some scenes dull, not the whole act though, but some of it made some unexpected choices.The Farewell is an amazing movie, well-acted, well-crafted and beautifully shot, it's one of the most memorable movies of 2019, though it's kinda not so rewatchable.I'm gonna give The Farewell a B+!Go see movies like this, it's really good to see people making these movie in 2019, instead of all those CGI-filled movies, this movie definitely deserves a look.Thank you as always for reading my review, look forward to more reviews very soon, and if you liked this, and you wanna see more of my work click on my name up above to see more.",The Farewell

The daughters romantic status and the question of wether she's going to marry or give her Nai Nai a grandchild.The film is really about the culture clash between east and west as explored by how we choose to treat death and approach life. And it works in that respect. The ending, I won't spoil it, was one of the most poetic and life affirming endings to a film that I've seen in years. I was beautiful. I just wish that the film had more layers, more depth, and had been more enjoyable all the way through.

109,helenbassett,The Farewell Film Review - Lulu Wang Directs An Actual Lie Well Told With Awkwafina The Spectre At The Wedding Feast,10,14 November 2019,"In A24's The Farewell, Shuzhen Zha's Nai Nai is diagnosed with terminal cancer in China, so her sister Little Nai Nai, played by Lu Hong, arranges for the whole family to visit her from around the world. The first time they will all have been together for 25 years. The film is based on director Lulu Wang's own family experience of the Chinese tradition of hiding the truth from a dying loved one. A wedding is announced for Nai Nai's Japan based grandson and his quiet Japanese girlfriend. And Awkwafina's New York based Billi, keeping her own secrets regarding her career, gets on a plane and joins the happy family. We watch as the ailing Nai Nai struggles up the stairs to her apartment, and then kicks the crap out of tai chi. She's not bowing out gracefully anytime soon. She has a Chinese wedding to prepare for. And she wants lobster.And with everyone in on the big fat lie, the only one happy in the family is Nai Nai. Billi's mother and father played by Diane Lin and Tzi Ma are struggling emotionally and didn't even want Billi to come. She may be too emotional with her beloved Grandmother, and inadvertently reveal the truth. Uncle Haibin played by Yongbo Jiang explains to Billi that in telling the lie the family are absorbing the burden of grief. You can see them all smiling happily in the poster!And Billi's mum profoundly tells her that it isn't the cancer that actually kills you, it's the fear. And with Nai Nai given three months to live, it does seem a kindly way to manage the diagnosis. Of course the handsome American educated young doctor is in on the plan. And Nai Nai, ever conscious of single Billi, suggests him as a potential husband, even as Billi questions him as to what they know of the opposite American way of truthfully handling such a diagnosis.The happy couple to be are Billi's cousin Hao Hao, played by the shellshocked, and so happy he cries, Chen Han, and the bemused Aiko, played Aoi Mizuhara. They've only been dating 3 months and Nai Nai notices that Aiko doesn't seem particularly in love. She doesn't speak Chinese and is probably too dazed at the speed of it all! The scenes with the wedding photographer going on in the background of an emotional moment with Nai Nai and Billi are a hoot. Lulu Wang carefully balances the emotion with the fun.But with two thirds of the family living in the US and Japan, the cracks start to show with the family who stayed in China, and whether the West is better than the East. Although the schools seem better as they have chosen to educate their young son in the West. The film explores themes that translate in any language, and is in both English and subtitled Mandarin. The visit to Nai Nai's husband's grave is surprising with professional mourners. They really go for it in a humorous but sorrowful scene. Again kudos to Lulu.And the wedding builds up to an emotional powerhouse. I watched a documentary recently, My Crazy Rich Chinese Wedding Planner, which mentioned a Chinese wedding is a chance to show off to business associates, and god knows who all the people are at this Wake. But they're having a great time!, with traditional speeches filled with tears!, and god awful karaoke. And more hilarity ensues when Nai Nai's hospital results are ready, and half the family leave midway to ensure they are doctored in line with the lie. The Farewell could almost be a French farce in another language.I wondered throughout whether it was Nai Nai who was keeping her own lie, knowing the outcome, but playing along with the family. And she gets the last laugh. I never found the film too emotional, which is all thanks to Lulu Wang's ace comic timing. Awkwafina's own comic skills were terrific in Crazy Rich Asians, but here she is subdued. Balancing her natural exuberant New York Billi, with the more respectful Chinese granddaughter, and a potential Oscar nod. The whole cast made the film a moving film event in an ordinary family's lives.",The Farewell
110,Jack_C_,Don't tell her,7,28 December 2019,"The literal translation for this movie is ""Don't Tell Her"". ""The Farewell"" was cooked up by Hollywood execs and doesn't quite communicate the overall theme.The film plays out like a slice of life feature centered around Grandma's stage 4 terminal cancer diagnosis. The family does everything to hide it from her, while bringing the family together under the guise of a rushed wedding.Awakafina's headstrong US-raised granddaughter role is an annoyingly sub-average character struggling with American millennial issues. Her broken Chinese and self-entitlement fails to emotionally connect. I also can't believe any traditional Chinese matriarch would just let her nose ring slide without a single comment.Character design flaws aside, after the arrival in Beijing, the story is told exactly as it could have played out in real life. The dialogue never ventures into contrived territory. Most characters, while underdeveloped, are vastly interesting.The subtle social commentary on China's culture of fraud, low quality goods, and lack of opportunity runs through out the story. Censorship and national identity is discussed, albeit much too briefly.Highly recommended.",The Farewell
111,Jackblyth8,I'm All For This,8,9 February 2021,"A heartwarming spectacle supporting the importance of family and togetherness. The film is based on director Wang's past life experiences, seeing Awkwafina and Zhao Shuzhen share the most screen time. Subtitles prove no concern for those unfamiliar with Mandarin and still endure the emotions displayed in the watch. The film centres around Chinese-American aspiring writer Billi, who is currently situated in New York City - her two parents also live in America. Her mother Jian and father Haiyan discuss the reality that Billi's loveable grandmother Nai Nai has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and doesn't have long to live. The family agree to keep the news from Nai Nai and arrange a fake wedding between newly coupled Hao Hao and his Japanese girlfriend Aiko. Due to Billi's close and emotional relationship with Nai Nai, her parents advise her to not travel with them to visit her in Changchun for the wedding, but, arriving late, Billi shows up at the gathering and promises not to mention Nai Nai's illness. The night before the wedding, the family engage in an argument against one another's loyalty to their origin, ironically inferring that Nai Nai's sickness is having a larger affect on the family rather than the woman herself. As organised, the wedding is a success, bringing the large family together in the same room. Nai Nai's son Haibin apologises to his mother for not being there for her and breaks into tears - Hao Hao does the same. Billi sprints to the hospital to collect her grandmother's medical results, altering the outcome for Nai Nai's sake. Nai Nai admits that her husband was diagnosed with cancer, and she chose not to tell him about his case - allowing him to pass calmly and unaware in the company of his wife. Billi states that she wants to stay in Changchun and stay with Nai Nai, but her family (including Nai Nai) insist she pursues her dream. The protagonist tells Nai Nai that she failed her Guggenheim Fellowship, only for her elder to reply saying she needs to keep pushing and not get hung up on this failure, rather than be ""the bull endlessly ramming its horns into the corner of the room."" She also says that life is not about what things one does, but more so about how one goes about doing them. Billi shares a tearful goodbye with Nai Nai and returns home, the rest of the family do the same. The credits reveal that six years after her diagnosis, the woman Nai Nai's character is based on is still alive today. A moving story portraying unity in a distanced family. Significantly, Nai Nai's diagnosis is the best thing to happen regarding the family, allowing everyone to rejoice and spend time with one another. Lulu Wang creates her fitting story with excellence and presents showcases the remarkable story of an unusual yet remarkable recovery. Picture and acting is a delight.",The Farewell

113,andrewburgereviews,Little gem of perfection,9,25 November 2019,"And what a little gem of perfection Lulu Wang's ""The Farewell"" is. This is the type of movie who might have it easy, because its power relies on easily accessible poignancy drawn from its plot. And Wang humanizes to the fullest because she does not succumb to accessible and tear-jerking cliches. This is as relatable as family life gets.Think about your favorite grandma. The one who always picks your side when your mother is riding you, the one who gives you money on the side, the one who always has to make sure you eat everything on your plate, the one who asks you again and again how are you feeling because she can sense your worries. Now imagine she is full of life, mordant and overall lovable. And now... imagine she has terminal cancer. This is exactly the description of Nai Nai (portrayed by the veteran Zhao Shuzhen). The poignancy hits hard from the harsh facts of the plot and Wang realizes she does not need to embroider this movie with more artificial emotional aids. Everything comes naturally.The plot revolves around Nai Nai's family hiding her disease from her and organizing a wedding early as a reason for everyone to see her. You can easily see not only the emotion here, but also the comedy. Indeed, ""The Farewell"" easily juggles between the two genres, weaving naturally and beautifully. At the center of the family, we follow Billi (Awkwafina). She lives in New York with her parents and, despite being a talented piano player, she struggles with money, career, friends, lovers--pretty much life in general. She also holds Nai Nai close to her heart and has second doubts whether the family should tell the truth or not. Nevertheless, her inner conflict, relatable and complex personality allows Awkwafina to give the best performance of her career.As we follow the family a few days prior to the wedding, there are so many great scenes, and this movie's humanity is found mostly in the ones in which the family gathers at the table. If you have seen the film, I bet you will relate with at least one of the discussions--workplace, stability, future, and so on. They all ensue towards a very modern anxiety of living today. Western and Eastern cultures clash brilliantly if not too obvious--but they needn't be. The scenes in which Billi arrives in China have her looking from a cab towards the Socialist-inspired designed buildings. You can sense she is sad about something, but you now is not politics. In a future scene, we get the answer. Billi, now alongside Nai Nai, rides a cab through her grandmother's old neighborhood which she describes as ""unrecognizable""--change on top of nostalgia--truly a powerful feeling which every human being has once experienced.We slowly understand that Billi loves Nai Nai because she is the only one left from her childhood, her only link to happiness. She despises her life in America and longs for her old life in China. An argument she has with her mother, who kept the death of Nai Nai's husband hidden from her and now tried to do the same, allows her to brilliantly express her regrets. And what powerful these moments are. Wang proves how able she is to work with human emotions, how natural and familiar she makes her characters express them. But is not all tragedy. The sweetest moments come from Nai Nai's nativity-driven optimism. These comedic moments immediately transition into sadness which, you can see, can barely be contained by the movie's characters.The ending is perfect. I will obviously not spoil it but I don't need to. At 100 minutes long, ""The Farewell"" is a compact gem of perfection, a warm, human movie that know exactly what it is. It does not beg for mercy, nor it cries for itself, it's just wrapped in its perfectly fit and polished package and allows emotion to flow naturally, which is how emotion should always be exteriorized.",The Farewell

That was before we noticed that the film currently maintains a 99% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.After seeing that, we had to take stock of the situation by contemplating whose opinion is closer to being ""correct"" with regard to judging the overall quality of the movie: ours or mainstream critics.For comparison, last year's breakout foreign film 'Shoplifters' also maintains a 99% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It won the Palm d'Or at Cannes in addition to 43 other awards around the world. The plot to 'Shoplifters' is wonderfully deep and complex. The acting is superb and the camerawork is among the best of the year.Alternatively, 'The Farewell' exhibits almost none of those attributes.

I appreciate indie films w/small moments, especially ones you might argue about later.Sadly, The Farewell only had three pluses: riveting performances from Awkwafina and Shuzen Zhao and the kernel of a great idea.By 15 minutes in, shaky production values had asserted themselves. The music tended toward melodramatic, the cinematography was dull and grainy, the subtitles were small and lacked clarity. As w/ Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, the studio advertised the bejezus out of this film, but it had no plot.The Farewell would've benefitted from some character development, or real conversations (vs. a 1-sided outburst) about family dynamics.

I thought it depicted intercultural differences around death and dying sensitively and authentically, and left me a lot to think about. The film reinforced my belief that there's something a woman brings to bear in a film that I really connect with, and I want to see more women behind the camera telling compelling stories like these.

The lifestyle of middle-class people, their beliefs, thoughts and ways of living life are quite similar. I expected more amount of humor, but the director focused more on heartfelt emotions rather than giving cheap humor and I loved it.It is a mesmerizing piece of real life portrayed on screen. that ooze out real emotions.

119,faroukgulsara,To tell or not to tell?,7,20 March 2020,"I first heard this story as being narrated by Lulu Wang in the podcast 'American Life'. It tells Lulu's story of how her family dealt with the news of her paternal grandmother's diagnosis of terminal lung cancer. It describes how Lulu's parents, together with her uncle's (father's brother) family in Japan, gathered in China, where the grandmother lives, to bid her farewell. The twist is that the whole family decided not to tell the patient, Nai Nai as she is affectionately referred to. The family, from three countries, descended upon Nai Nai's house under the pretext of celebrating Lulu's Japanese cousin's wedding.Lulu's role is portrayed as an early 30s Chinese American student who goes to China in a soul-searching journey to rediscover her Chinese identity. She learns to appreciate the traditional family values. As their old values dictate that the happy mind would give a healthy body, the family thought that not telling Nai Nai of her disease and its grave prognosis. Still, instead of keeping her happy in the company of the people loves, it would go a long way in prolonging her life.The trick seems to have worked in the case of Nai Nai. Even though she was given only three months to live by her Chinese physicians (and the diagnosis was agreed by American doctors), she went on to live another six years.The traditional wisdom in modern medicine is that the patient has the right to know his or her disease. By understanding the extent of his illness, he is in a position to go all out to combat his ailment, especially which is chronic. This is especially so in cases where the prognosis is uncertain, like in cancers. A patient's attitude and resolve towards fighting the sickness and one-mindedness in battling cancer may actually alter the final outcome.A person in the terminal stage of her infirmity may want to step up his preparations for the ethereal world. He may want to tick off the items in his bucket list (pun unintended). The content of his will may need alterations and many more.In many Indian families too, I have noticed that the family would collectively decide that bad news, especially of the medical kind, would not be made known to the elder members. Are the family members worried that breaking bad news may trigger a cardiovascular and emotional meltdown that would be more devastating?",The Farewell
120,babybuletgani,Declined for a fellowship and hence unable to make her rent,8,23 October 2019,"Declined for a fellowship and hence unable to make her rent, Billi's troubles worsen when her parents inform her that her beloved grandmother, Nai Nai (Zhao Shuzhen), has Stage 4 lung cancer and three months to live. But here's the thing: in China, where Nai Nai still resides (in the north-eastern city of Changchun), it's common practice for doctors and family members to hide news of terminal illness from those afflicted, in order to carry the burden for them. So it is that Nai Nai's extended family descend upon Changchun from America and Japan under the ruse that Billi's cousin, Hao Hao (Chen Han), is getting married. And Nai Nai, being an octogenarian matriarch who's full of love but tolerates zero crap, takes it upon herself to organise the banquet.
'Based on an actual lie' is the first thing to appear on screen, and indeed the film is: Wang's own Nai Nai really did have Stage 4 lung cancer, and the family actually staged a fake wedding so that it might rally around her. It's a remarkable tale, but more remarkable still is that Wang resisted pressure from American studios to fashion it into a screwball comedy or melodrama, and instead plays it low-key and straight. Sure, there are laughs, and yes, there is sentiment, but the former are of the observational rather than farcical variety, and the latter is drip-fed and well-earned. Shooting with natural colours and largely static compositions, DoP Anna Franquesa Solano rightly trusts the material isn't in need of tics and tricks to help it along - a small series of modest whip-pans at the wedding feels like GoodFellas after the poise that has come before. And yet every scene commands attention, whether it's the looming architecture and bustling streets, or the constant preparation and consumption of food (a way for the family to demonstrate love without recourse to vulgar declarations), or the comparing and contrasting of Chinese and American values. Billi, meanwhile, propels the action, for it is her constant questioning of the morality of the lie they are living that introduces suspense and drama.
Most of all, though, The Farewell is a film about family, with all of its frets and foibles, fondness and fidelity. It is heartfelt and beautifully observed, so while everyone on screen is doing their utmost to hold back tears, yours will come unchecked.",The Farewell

122,nehpetstephen,"Trust China, we know what's best for you!",3,8 January 2020,"THE FAREWELL treats the decision to withhold a cancer diagnosis from a patient as a Chinese cultural practice. One character even quotes a supposed old Chinese saying to justify this practice. This tactic may seem unusual to an American viewer in 2019, but it was business as usual in America until the late 1970s. Susan Sontag, in 1978, wrote ILLNESS AS METAPHOR while recovering from breast cancer. She details the thinking behind such routines in that book. More recently, the second season of ""Fargo"" featured this issue. Although THE FAREWELL treats such withholding as a harmless issue of cultural relativity that, in the end, reflects positively on Chinese customs, what is actually under debate in this film is an OUTDATED custom, one that is deceptive, paternalistic, and stigmatizing toward illness and healthcare.Zhao Shuzhen, who plays the cancer-diagnosed Nai Nai in the film, turns in a wonderful performance. I suppose it's not an especially challenging role to play a strong but sweet grandmother, but she does exude charm. The film, the autobiographical filmmakers, and the characters clearly love her, and that love is manipulated into the supposed motivation for their deception of her. (I ask you, when was the last time you lied to your lover and then, when caught, explained your bad behavior by saying, ""I only did it because I love you!"" How did that go over?)Their withholding of her personal information is presented as a self-sacrifice, though it's not exactly clear what they're giving up in the sacrifice. They have to conceal their emotions (which they do a very poor job of anyway), but in exchange they get to continue selfishly enjoying their grandmother without having to deal with her cancer, her treatments, her grief, her desire to maybe do something different with her life now that she knows her health condition, etc., etc. This could all be a very interesting subject to examine in a film, as it's a wonderful source of tension; however, no alternative is ever really presented to the viewer. We know that Nai Nai wants to know the truth, yet we never see what might happen if she were to learn it--how she might feel, how she might respond, how she might deal with her illness. None of the other characters are ever truly tested; rather, they passively go along with the deception. In the end, the film presents their plan as having succeeded. A title screen abruptly announces that all these years later, Nai Nai is still alive (and still, even as her family is profiting from a film about her struggle, being lied to). This is meant to serve as prima facie evidence that they did the right thing, as though she would have obviously died if they had pursued some other plan. And since the decision is presented as a matter of Chinese culture (in contrast to American culture), the film thus becomes a victory for the Chinese way of doing things.This is self-centered crap that's literally exploiting the grandmother. The philosophy espoused here is, ""I know what's best for you, and I'm going to make those decisions--decisions that could literally cost you your life--regardless of your input, and, in fact, in direct contrast to your input."" Such a philosophy is called paternalism because it tends to go hand in hand with misogyny. It's also a philosophy that, in this particular case, stigmatizes illness (better not to speak of it!), stigmatizes healthcare (doing nothing is sometimes better!), and literally robs a woman of her agency, her right to choose what to do with her body, her life, and her time.This message is tidily tied up with general pro-Chinese sentiments. (The film is partially financed by China.) The film doesn't deny that the Chinese believe the American educational system to be superior, yet the main character's mother is depicted as extremely rude for bringing such matters up at an inappropriate time. The main character's depression is likewise presented as being derived from the trauma of having been separated from China against her will. All in all, one walks away with a positive view of China's views toward individual well-being... a harshly opposing view to what you might glean from other recent films like One Child Nation, An Elephant Sitting Still, American Factory, or Sister (a short by Siqi Song). The film could have been great--and certain technical qualities like the cinematography were, in fact, quite polished and enjoyable--if it had explored these issues in a way that was nuanced or at least actually interested in presenting counterarguments. This film instead gets a very low rating from me because it instead abandons such nuance for a tidy, propagandistic celebration of a (currently) autocratic society.And on a side note: Awkwafina? She was one of the funniest hosts of ""Saturday Night Live"" in recent years, and she's generally quite the charismatic show stealer. All her humor and talent are squandered here, however. There's no range to her performance. All she does is pout. Why are people saying she deserves accolades? A comedian isn't a good actor simply because she's capable of frowning. While I wish her the best and look forward to her future performances, I simply don't get the esteem for her role in this awful film.",The Farewell

Then I read the other reviews and noticed something remarkable: the people who were of Chinese heritage rated it lower in general than did people of European heritage. This was confirmed when I saw the movie with a friend who is Chinese, who has similar tastes to mine in just about all other areas. She also was disappointed in ""The Farewell"", though she was the one who wanted to see it in the first place!

One thing, the grandmother is unaware of her illness and the family isn't saying a thing hoping it's better to let her go happy.The Farewell is a masterfully done, beautiful, funny and personal film about love and loss and how much heartache a single little lie can bring. The film is inspired by Director Lulu Wang's own grandmother and I commend her for telling and sharing such a personal film with us. It's a film that we can all relate too. Everyone has witnessed loss and we all deal with it in certain ways and film gives us an interesting question: is it better to let our loved ones die happy or die scared, knowing they're going to die. The film never answers this question and it shouldn't. It's up for the viewer to decided that.The film is made up of powerful performances from its all Asian cast and gives us a beautiful granddaughter grandmother relationship which is one of the most heart wrenching of relationships I've seen put to film this year. Awkwafina gives wonderful and solemn performance that feels completely out of her comfort zone and Zhao Shuzhen is absolutely incredible as Nai Nai and is the heart of the film.The Farewell manages to blend comedy with drama in a mixture that never feels unbalanced and is a wonderful piece to celebrate the end days of a loved one.

129,sherylchilders82,"The Farewell @ Cobb Lakeside Lakeland, FL",8,19 August 2019,"I've taken the time to write this in defense of the negative reviews, which at first I found surprising. But, not as much when I thought about it, because this film will challenge traditional Western opinions. If you are an American and conservative who sees the world in black and white, this movie will probably make you uncomfortable, mainly because it's so well made. I had not read any reviews before seeing it, but saw the trailer and knew that it had high ratings.The film speaks to a Western audience that is unfamiliar with Chinese culture as a whole, but the family depicted is in a well off class, even by American standards. I really am not familiar enough with Chinese economics to know whether the claim in the movie that it is easy to get rich in China is accurate or not, but I'm guessing this doesn't apply to all people there (as I wouldn't apply it to every demographic in the US, either). But, it has a lot to say about the cultural differences between the East and West, and this point left more to be desired. As a less well off person, this point did not speak to me personally.The first plot point about the cultural difference is made subtly between the main Chinese American character checking into her hotel in China. She is a single young woman visiting her dying grandmother and attending a wedding, born in China, but raised in the US. The clerk who helps her with her bag inquires enthusiastically about whether it is ""better"" in America, a belief that pervades around the world, including America. She responds that it is ""just different"", implying that it is no better or worse. This point is exemplified in the situations portrayed, which seem very similar to things in the US - the grandmother argues with the wedding caterer over the banquet entreés, guests make drunk toasts, and the family argues over little things. Other than a different alcoholic beverage and the ethnicity / language of the characters, much of the plot could happen in America. One might suspect that this movie is pro or anti-American, but it is neither. At one point, the mother tells a heartwarming story about American kindness, and the main plot is a positive perspective on an aspect of Chinese culture.The main plot revolves around hiding a grandmother's terminal illness from her, a common practice in China. In the beginning of the film, we share our protagonist's opinion that this is wrong and somehow cruel to the dying woman. As mentioned at one point, it would actually be illegal in the US. But, the revelation comes when the uncle, dad, and daughter are speaking on the balcony. Others have noted in their reviews his poignant argument for the practice. He says that the primary difference between Eastern and Western culture is that rather than focusing on the rights of individuals, the focus is on families and society as a whole. Concealing her illness from her is a sort of kindness, taking the emotional burden from her and bearing it themselves, instead. It is said that they believe it is not the cancer which kills them, but the fear, which isn't entirely inaccurate. Modern medicine knows that stress can aggravate and speed illness, but we place a higher value on control over our individual autonomy in America (and our right to make our own medical decisions).The point is not whether one perspective is more correct than the other, just that they are different perspectives from different cultures. Honestly, I loved the music, but I wasn't as moved at first by this film as I thought I would be. I think if you keep an open mind throughout, you will appreciate it more. By the end, I understood why a whole population of people could believe this was acceptable (hiding the illness) - like not telling a person fatally wounded that they were in fact taking their last breath. Personally, I would want to know, but I saw the beauty in it. It was seeing the sensitive groom cry during the operatic ballad that moved me to tears, finally. This was the best ""indie"" or artsy film I saw this summer, and I was very glad that I went.",The Farewell

132,sheldonnylander,Beautiful an Heartbreaking,8,13 November 2019,"When a Chinese family finds out that the family's matriarch is dying of lung cancer, complications arise. In Chinese culture, there is a saying that when you get cancer, you die. This actually boils down to the belief that it's not the cancer that leads to the person's death, but rather the fear of dying. As such, the family orchestrates an elaborate ruse to get everyone together for a wedding, but in reality the gathering is for everyone to be able to say goodbye to the grandmother without actually letting her know the truth.It's a fascinating premise and based on a true story (or based on an actual lie, as the film puts it). Showing aspects of Chinese culture we rarely get to see, the film takes us on a journey to China as we see modern life and urban development. How accurate it really is, I can't attest to, and there are times that it feels like there should be more or that something is more complex and we're being given the fortune cookie version, so to speak. The film does steer clear of politics, so that is not a factor here.This is a beautiful film not just through visual aesthetics but also on a character level. We see how each character faces the impending death of the grandmother differently, such as the daughter-in-law being very matter of fact about it while her husband (the grandmother's son) is being torn up inside, all while the wise and experienced grandmother continues to dispense advice, oblivious to her diagnosis. It details the variety of relationships we can develop in our life as no two relationships are the same, but they all still love each other despite some distance between certain relatives. There's something that, despite the comedic premise (it's sort of a comedy that's not particularly funny), is very grounded and very real. I couldn't help but see some of my own relationships reflected on the screen.Beautiful, heartbreaking, and at the same time somewhat hopeful, ""The Farewell"" comes highly recommended.",The Farewell

The matriarch (Zhao Shuzhen) of a Chinese family is diagnosed with terminal cancer and given three months to live, but instead of informing her, the doctors inform her family who decide to keep it a secret from her. Both of her sons live outside of China, the older in Japan and the younger in the United States. The older son's own son (Han Chen) is engaged to a Japanese woman (Aio Mizuhara), so they decide to hold the wedding in Changchun in northern China so that everyone can say good-bye to the matriarch. Billi (the Chinese-American rapper Awkwafina), the daughter of the younger son, has lived in the U.S. since the age of six and disagrees. Because of cell phones and inexpensive intercontinental telephone service, she is actually closer to her grandmother (""Nai Nai"" in Mandarin) than to her own parents (Tzi Ma and Diana Lin). One of the best scenes takes place when Nai Nai attempts to play matchmaker between Billi and a British-educated doctor, and another in a cemetery when they visit the gravesite of Nai Nai's late husband. It is based on writer/director Lulu Wang's own experiences, and it is about as good a blend of comedy and drama as I have seen in a long time with Nai Nai getting the best lines.",The Farewell

This could've been told in a 10-minute short film - the girl finds out her grandma has cancer, she visits her, feels extremely heavy and despairing inside, but must keep a secret, then goes home - instead, they made it a featured film. The rest is filled with extremely long, cinematic and slow-motion scenes that add nothing to the plot. Why do filmmakers feel the need to put on so much aesthetics to stretch out films like this when they essentially have nothing to say?The story has one conflict: the questioning of morality around lying to the grandmother about her illness - accompanied by the theme of Chinese vs. American culture. There were a few funny lines of clever commentary on this, but nothing was resolved at the end. Characters simply feel sad and reflect about it, but there was no climax, no progressions, no solutions. As an Asian American, I was disappointed.

It's wonderfully directed with clever language ploys and culture clashes at the forefront. The premise is stated upfront - a Chinese family try to keep their Grandmother from knowing that she is terminally ill. Hard to review without spoilers, it's a complete roller-coaster of emotions (that's a cliche but it's true). There are moments of hilarity (the cemetery scene especially) and moments of pure emotion (most of the scenes towards the end). I went in to this film blind, and found myself googling everything about it 2 mins after the credits rolled.The Farewell is a film about saying goodbye to a person, but also has lots to say about saying goodbye to culture, family traditions, places and values. It deals with these things very sensitively. I found myself comparing it to the films of Hirokazu Koreeda alot of the time, mostly because of the family aspect.I've never heard of Awkwafina, but she was completely brilliant in this, and most of the rest of the cast held their own too. Even the real life family member of the Director.There are a couple of flaws (we didn't need the little bird for instance).

The Farewell is an ode to every family from Lulu Wang (8.5/10),8,24 November 2019,"What I loved about this film is the fact that the director wasn't too busy to differentiate between eastern and western culture. Instead, she showed how any culture in this world can both be right and wrong. She left it to the audience to judge what's right and what's wrong. The Farwell tells the story of a Chinese family who discovers their grandmother is dying of cancer. And they decide not to tell her the truth. Being a South Asian, that what we might do. I won't share my personal opinion about what's right and what's wrong. What I'll share is how amazingly Lulu Wang was involved in the story! The humor and sadness are so well mixed in the writing and direction that makes 'The Farewell' an unforgettable movie of 2019.

150,lucaslw-93145,One of the good A24 Films,8,29 July 2019,"A24 makes films with unique premises. They've created disasters like The Florida Project and Swiss Army Man. They've also created great movies like Ex Machina, Lady Bird, Eighth Grade, and now, The Farewell. The thing that all A24 movies seem to have in common is a unique plot or plot environment that makes for a great movie concept. As such, many of their movie trailers are captivating and draw viewers in. Unfortunately, it seems that relying so heavily on unique premises means that execution of the film can make or break a movie, leaving little room for an A24 movie to be mediocre (although *and I understand this is an unpopular opinion* I do think they managed to achieve mediocrity with Oscar winner Moonlight).The Farewell is a high 8 out of 10, if it had a more conclusive or impactful ending, I would be comfortable giving it a low 9 out of 10. The story is really captivating and each cast member is their own bubble of flaws, quirks, and relatable Chinese-culture-derived idiosyncrasies. The most standout part of the film, beyond the excellent pacing, world-building, and dialogue, is how genuine each scene feels. From little things like Nai Nai doing a spot on mimic of Awkwafina's signature head bob to the tension between the parts of the extended family who identify with different nationalities, every part of the movie feels like something out of real life, something that I could see happening in my own life. It's this authentic level of relatability(, which most based-on-a-true-story films struggle to capture, ) that really makes the movie so enthralling.The movie has small issues like Awkwafina's nearly unintelligible Chinese being understood perfectly and an awkward film conclusion, but those were not nearly enough to overshadow the terrific performance from the entire cast and the great story that A24's Lulu Wang was able to successfully bring to life.",The Farewell
151,sznhgn,Sweet but boring,2,19 August 2019,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but this was not a good movie. The cultural custom that it focuses on is interesting, but that's all. Awkwafina is a bright spot because she exudes more expression and emotion than any other actor. I guess that was her role, but the script tended to go over the same ground. Also, the quality of production didn't seem all that great. All in all, it was like a documentary with a ""sort of"" storyline, but not a documentary.

152,ryanmoynihan,Not Everyone's Goodbye is the Same,8,22 September 2020,"""In the East, a person's life is part of a whole.""Billi's Uncle explains the Chinese position on their lie beautifully in such simple terms. They are shouldering the burden and grief of impending death for their Nai Nai. When understood from that perspective it's easy to see why lying might be the right thing to do. As an American film goer, watching this movie really challenged some views I've always percieved as ""normal"". What, on paper, may have seemed wrong to me before, now seems admirable. I may not choose to face losing a loved one the same way in my life, but that doesn't make their way any less moral.Lulu Wang films almost every conversation giving so much breath to each shot. Shot reverse shots aren't close ups. Instead they're mediums and give space to both characters involved. The back of Nai Nai's head is still in frame as she speaks to Billi. Party scenes often include many characters' faces and heads. Characters in center frame give off a sense of isolation and sadness even when surrounded by family in the same shot. I'm specifically referring to Billi and her father in most cases. They are the ones who have a tougher time hiding their emotions. Funny enough everyone breaks character at some point. This isn't an easy show to put on for anyone.Characters will mimic one another physically to convey a shared emotion. For example, when Billi is first told about her grandma's disease she has walked into her parents' bedroom where her father sits on the bedside, his back to the camera. As soon as she's given the news she sits beside him, her back to the camera as well.The Farewell is so quiet and subdued in its portrayal of family dynamics and grief that its profound emotional impacts crept up on me.

However the quality of this film feels inconsistent and clunky. There are quite a few good acting moments though mostly tacky, the dialogues were too theatrical and over sentimental. (I'm really excited for Awkwafina! Can't wait to see her tackle some good dramedy roles!)
I wish I had seen more ""Billi and Nai nai do stuff together"" and connecting like the exercise scene, and way less preaching & discussing. (a very good example it reminded me is The Way Home 2002).

154,nyccents,Pros & Cons,8,21 July 2019,"The good news is this is character-driven movie that gives one a sense of a displaced millennial, displaced in many senses of the word. It is informative from a cultural point of view, and the slow pace is both artistic but at times, given our addiction to fast-pacing, annoying. Long camera shots, scenes that last slightly longer than you expect. And yet that all contributes to the credibility of the overall plot. There are nuances in relationships among the characters that are lovely --the two brothers for example. The mother-daughter.The bad news is this is not great cinematography nor enough humor. Awkwafina delivers a good dramatic persona, but not any lightness. Hard to imagine her as a comedian elsewhere. The plot is a bit overworked and some holes.Conclusion: interesting insights and worth seeing, just don't believe all the hype before you go. It does give an alternate view of life in China than the glitz one usually sees in the news and travel photos.",The Farewell

I found out that it's the exact opposite. Extremely boring, slowly paced, and what would have been a lovely half-hour documentary absolutely doesn't work for a full length movie. Furthermore, there is so much sadness, and hardly any laughs. I actually walked out after 2/3's of the movie, as I couldn't take a minute more. I thought perhaps it was just me, but from reading these reviews I guess not.

I think there were a lot of missing ingredients but mostly this movie relies on very familiar and unoriginal Hollywood storytelling devices. So, I felt like there was nothing original, vital or interesting happening on screen. There are no difficult questions here but there are a lot of bromides about east and west, family, Asia, etc. It's all predigested for today's audience which is perhaps not in the mood for anything uncomfortable or difficult. I have to say that the acting was really especially bad; they seemed like soap opera actors. However, the director doesn't help them out either. There are a bunch of scenes in which the actors are supposed to be reaching some dramatic moment but they just look like they're acting. That could be the director's fault or the weakness of the script too.",The Farewell

158,MovieTim14,Torn between two worlds,9,19 May 2020,"The Farewell, directed by Lulu Wang, is a beautifully touching film that touches on many thought-provoking themes such as culture, family, and death. With profound meaning and beautiful performances, I found this to be the most moving cinematic experience I've had recently.When a Chinese Grandmother is given a terminal cancer diagnosis, her granddaughter living in America, Billi (played brilliantly by Awkwafina), is shocked to find that her family intends to keep the diagnosis a secret from her precious ""Nai Nai."". As they stage a fake wedding back home in China so that the family can say their goodbyes to the family matriarch, Billi struggles to maintain this lie for her Grandmother, as she does not fully understand it the way the rest of her family does.I don't know who else this would be true for, but speaking for myself as an American, I found this premise to be so intriguing that it was almost alien. How could you keep someone from knowing they're dying? The film does its work early on though for viewers like me to understand the cultural viewpoint that creates this decision, rather than to let me callously judge a perspective I don't understand. Throughout the story as well, you gain a deeper understanding of their reasoning through their cultural lens.Through Billi, it's this tension of different cultural perspectives that forms the heart of the story, both personally for her, and thematically. The family and what they are going through represent a microcosm of the immigrant experience in general, and understanding how to belong to two different worlds.While this theme was strong and important, the aspect I enjoyed most about this film is how natural everything feels. Not once throughout my viewing did I feel like I was watching movie characters, but just real people. This is a testament to screenplay and acting alike. I felt like a fly on the wall, witnessing a real family have honest conversations with honest feelings. The naturalism also makes this quite a funny movie, despite the dark subject matter. Far from the doom and gloom of their most private moments, the family lives life to the fullest with Nai Nai, and I was regularly joyful and laughing as they sang karaoke, played drinking games, and had silly arguments with each other.If I have any criticism of this movie, it's only that the naturalist touches sometimes go a little too far and lead to some odd cinematic flourishes, such as a shot that lingers on something too long, or some dialogue that seems a little too pointless. Others might find that the story never quite ramps up the way one might expect, which might be frustrating for some. For myself though, that last point was never salient, as the performances carried that poignancy on their shoulders, not needing the plot to artificially escalate.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to witness a thing of beauty.",The Farewell

161,ben-snooks,"Funny, contemporary, realistic",8,1 September 2019,"I'm disappointed by many of the other reviews here and I'm actually a bit surprised. This movie tells the manifestation of a lie unfolding between Eastern and Western cultures. In the west we are taught from a young age that keeping secrets and lying is essentially bad. In the East there is the notion of a good lie. This issue is central to this film and explores how the two cultures accept the emotional burden of telling a lie depending on whether they believe it is good or bad. There are some funny moments but they are very nuanced and again often related to cultural peculiarities. I noticed the other film goers weren't laughing as much as me. I could imagine myself in China trying to politely remove the hotelier from my room as well. Reading from other reviews I suspect this film will appeal to lovers of Asian art-house cinema, myself included, perhaps more than american cinema audiences. This is certainly not a Hollywood popcorn movie and it doesn't try to be. I think this film could have been improved a little by putting a little bit back of any scenes which was were perhaps cut out. I could have had another 20 minutes more to explore some of the characters more, perhaps the ""bride and groom"". In saying that, the pacing was very good and the whole package felt fairly sharply edited down to it's 90 mins running time. I look forward to more films to come by this talented director. I'm glad Lulu Wang was able to make this very personal film.",The Farewell

As someone who had to say goodbye to her grandmother for one last time before leaving the country, knowing she would likely never see me again... I am biased,but I am touched. This film captures the feeling of guilt and of being powerless in a very real way.

163,tatbtsisb,"An emotional, heartfelt film as an Asian.",8,20 December 2019,"A story about an Asian American girl who travelled back to China after learning that her grandmother is about to pass, The Farewell is an emotional, heartfelt and genuine movie that has captured my heart as an Asian person. With a budget of only $3 million dollars, this movie is honestly very well done. Some people say it's abit slow, but maybe that's the point. The story is about an American girl who tries to spend time with her Chinese grandmother, trying to connect with the culture she had lost. This movie is almost perfect. The cinematography was very well done and matched very well to the mood of the film. The production design is flawless and the city was gorgeous. The score was amazing, really fit well with the story, even though it's strange how they didn't really use Chinese music. The story felt realistic and not over the top. The tone of the movie is really fitting and works very well. The characters are well thought out, they seemed like actual complex people. I like how they made the grandma so loveable and adorable, which reminds me of my grandmas. The performances were fine, nothing over the top. The best thing about this movie is how well they captured Asian culture, how they perfectly nailed all the little aspects of Asian culture, the food eating, the shrine scene, the weddings. The only disappointment I had is about the story, I felt like they should've added more to it. To try to connect with us on more of an emotional level. Don't get me wrong, this movie is sad, but it's not super sad. I felt like they should've added something to make us feel even more love for the characters.Overall, this movie is really well done.

165,rstarzecmoviecritic,Not As Good As You're Hoping,7,21 August 2019,"Initial reactions for ""The Farewell"" were not just good - they were phenomenal, with many critics saying it is clearly the best movie to come out of 2019 so far. With a 99 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, reviews for ""The Farewell"" set a very high bar for audiences before they had a chance to see it. While ""The Farewell"" certainly has its moments, the high standard set by the critics will most likely disappoint the majority of ""regular"" audiences who will go to see this indie drama produced by A24.The best aspect of ""The Farewell"" is the cast of the film and the wonderful performances that the cast members give, especially from the star, Awkwafina. The start of the movie establishes the close emotional bond Awkwafina's character, Billi, shares with her grandmother, ""Nai Nai."" When Billi learns that her grandmother is expected to pass away in the near future (though Nai Nai knows nothing about that), Billi's parents warn her that she has never been able to hide her emotions effectively, so she is advised not to go visit her grandmother like the rest of the family. The minute she arrives at her grandmother's place, Awkwafina proves to portray this characteristic of her character perfectly. She is clearly struck with grief, but her face shows her holding her emotions back just barely enough to not give anything away to Nai Nai. Though the writing is not necessarily enticing, later in the movie, Awkwafina delivers a couple different monologues about the ethics of lying to Nai Nai with such powerful emotion that she steals the show for this movie.The dramatic irony of the audience, as well as the rest of Nai Nai's family, knowing that Nai Nai has cancer is a pretty important part of this movie, as it sets up a lot of emotional moments as well as some humorous ones scattered throughout the film. It really pulls the emotional strings whenever Nai Nai makes offers to help with her grandson's wedding since she should be in charge of the planning or when she refers to doing something in the distant future. It also will evoke tears from the audience when Nai Nai sees somebody crying or upset and she genuinely asks what the matter is with no idea of what is going on. The movie proves to be particularly emotional at the wedding scene very late in the story.As mentioned above, however, the movie is not as enticing as a majority of critics have led audiences to believe. The story may be an emotional one, but most scenes in the film simply consist of the family having long conversations, whether it is with or without Nai Nai. It becomes very repetitive that the movie keeps pounding it into your brain that Nai Nai does not have long to live and how it is affecting the emotions of her family members while it does not affect her at all since she is ignorant to the fact she has cancer. It is a good quality movie, but it is also a very boring movie, especially for a movie that is under two hours in duration.""The Farewell"" has great intentions, and its phenomenal cast makes it worth it to watch once. However, it is also simple and repetitive to the point that you'll be looking at your watch every so often wondering how much time has passed since the last time you looked.7/10",The Farewell

Brought to us by A24 (the company responsible for ""Eighth Grade"" and others), this movie is made and directed with such care and craft for the story being told. Every moment feels painfully real and earnest. Awkwafina, who plays Billi, helps guide the audience through this emotional roller coaster by giving her best performance as of yet. Each shot is constructed to represent the feelings of each individual perfectly. And the ending (which I will not spoil) is satisfying without feeling forced or cheesy in any way. I can't remember a film in recent memory that I can say I had never seen anything like before to this extent, to the point where I gasped during the last shots of the film. I hope very dearly that the Oscars represent Awkwafina's performance in this film with at least a nomination. She holds my favorite female performance of the year, and my hopes go out to her.

Its a sad truth that many of us live in especially in the Chinese society.Its a powerful message or a dilemma to deal with especially Billie grew up in America where she had the western culture telling the truth in contrast with China the eastern culture by lying to confine her from dealing with cancer.Great cinematography especially on distress scene and especially on the colour palette and choices they had used to maximize the emotions. Also such a great score, the soft humming and music just blends in so well and lit up the movie up to the expectation.It all comes to the ending part, where it all comes down and related to the title, The Farewell, where its just seeing her one last time and makes us wonder back all of those fond little memories of our beloved parents and grandparents.

That is a skill of the great storytelling, not ruined by Hollywood ""committee"" , but delivered exactly how it should, feelling exactly how it felt.
The side characters left us wanting more of them, but that is a very good sign. To those commenting that they were underdeveloped: to tell their story would require series, not a movie.

The overuse of melodramatic score and mediocre cinematography at once appear cringey; it may also indicate that the director/writer lacks a good story to tell. Awkwafina, with her charisma, almost singlehandedly saved the film. The rest of it is filled with superficiality and insincerity, which even add up to kitsch. The story is not a complicated one, yet the script avoids almost every possible deep discussion by blaming the conflicts to ""the differences between the East and the West."" Linguistic inequality plays a role, but there are hardly ever any substantial dialogues between the family members, which renders the ""Eastern family"" idea advocated in the movie ridiculous. There are, in reality, so many things to talk, or at least to hint, about: Cultural Revolution the grandmother certainly went through, the Tiananmen Square protests that the parents possibly experienced, first-gen immigrant experience, identity confusion of Billi, just to name a few. Wasting lots of scenes on suburban China's ""rituals,"" the film did a terrible job depicting both Asia and Asian-Americans. It then leads to the portrayal of the family members, which also fails. I can quickly name that the grandmother are the mother are authoritarian, the cousin introverted, etc. The Japanese woman is like an ornament to the Chinese family. What strikes me is the absence of male figures in Billi's family, which made me wonder how Billi still managed to become a wonderful person she is of today given her mother hardly listened.

The whole ensemble just carries the story amazingly. There's never a dull moment. You're constantly laughing/smiling and then the last scene. I am thousand of miles away from my family and this movie made me cry. I miss them. I highly recommend this movie guys.

190,map-78480,One of the best movies of 2019,10,28 May 2020,The farewell is without a doubt one of the best movies which was released in 2019. It is a shame it went unnoticed by many as many prefer superhero or action movies to a family drama movie. Without spoiling anything. The story is about a family which gathers together after they find out their grandmother's cancer diagnosis.This movie is excellent due to two reasons: Lulu Wangs screenplay and the performance of Awkwafina and Zhao Shuzhen. Wang screenplay displays the family dynamic very well. Members of the family are in conflict and it also deals with the emotions of leaving one's country and immigrating to another country. She balances comedic and dramatic moments very well with her screenplay making us cry and laugh all throughout this movie.As mentioned before the the screenplay and the acting makes this movie one of the best of lasts year particularly that of awkwafina and Zhao Shuzhen. Awkwafina is has always beeen hilarious in movies but she showed her dramatic potential in this movie. She is amazing as a loving granddaughter who is dealing with the news of her grandmothers condition. Zhao Shuzhen is the star of the film. Most of the films comedic moments come from her and she pulls it off effortlessly. But by the end of the movie she will also rip your heart out especially in the final scene.All in all this movie is a great movie that should not be unseen just because it wasn't a hit,The Farewell
191,tercera,Peaceful,9,31 July 2020,"Finally, I came to watch this film on my playlist. Mostly because I had heard a lot of praise during award season. And also, because I'd heard how funny akawafina is (sorry about the spelling). Well, she wasn't very funny. Which, trust me it's a good thing. She's so charismatic though. She draws you in even when she's sad. And so does the grandma.
It is a very melancholic film obviously so, if you read the synopsis. But it's not a tear jerker at all. Although there are contained tears, I'm so glad that they didn't have any character break down in an outburst. Even though it felt it could happen at any point until the very end. It felt in a strange way peaceful",The Farewell

But there is a thin line between portrayal and exoticism. Though the film hits the right notes when it comes to family, attitudes on death, and grief, I feel a lot of the supposed tension between the East and West was a little lost here, pandering instead to the Western taste of the exotic East, thus giving a rather shallow treatment to the whole thing. I adored Zhou Shuzhen in this film; I feel that she was the only one who exceptionally shined here, taking her character to the next level. I don't agree with those who say this is a bad film as I see its merits, but I do also note the fact that it banked more on the diversity (sometimes just a ten dollar word for exotic) rather than an actual good, solid storyline.",The Farewell

So, so far we have known Billi.Afterwards, we enter your family, which claims the pain of your matriarch. Lulu Wang puts her spice of humor into creating a fake marriage, between two wierd, but funny characters. I thought the caricature of the Japanese girl was very funny.I can't forget Nai Nai's sister, who was the first to stand by her sister's illness, and who also has a comical aspect.Nai Nai is full of meaning, and I doubt it is just because her family hid her illness, she proved to be that person with thirst and joy of living, an example for us.",The Farewell

198,penciler,Rule-breakers,6,5 August 2019,"I love films that on paper shouldn't work, but just DO, often by dint of directorial genius. Mad Max: Fury Road, for example, is a big chase that turns around and chases back the other way. Sounds like 200-proof stupidity, but you find me an action film that's as inspired, gripping and affecting. Once Upon the Time in the West should by rights be a bloated bore, but it holds your attention and rewards it.The Farewell is not one of these movies. It has an interesting setup, one that might have yielded powerful drama or even black comedy. But to do either, it would need something it doesn't have.Call it incident, complication, pay-off, a twist--whatever, this film no have. Most of the cast is exceptional. But a setup doth not a story make. This is a bloated bore that shrinks from multiple opportunities to turn the tale in a direction, ANY direction, let alone a dramatically fruitful one.Further demerits for:
Grating scoreScenes that make you say, ""Hmm: Supposed to be funny?""Oldsters dispensing pat advice, from time-worn and tone-deaf to wise, none of which affects another character in any wayOverlengthCreating the comedy-ish premise of a fake wedding and then, unforgivably, not letting it fully play out. In Simpsons terms, they never got to the fireworks factory!Dull, complacent cinematographyBeing content with itself just for superficially presenting a recognizably Chinese family, but not testing or challenging it.Not fleshing out the main character Billi's difficult relation to her mother.One of the few parts of The Farewell that both felt lived-in and interesting was that mother-daughter story. But it was largely treated largely in one beautifully-acted, under-written, almost-powerful scene. Cruelly, the scene suggested the story's beating heart existed, somewhere near, but not entirely connected to the proceedings.",The Farewell

There are some redeeming qualities but they are nowhere near significant enough to warrant paying a full-price movie ticket to watch this film.This movie was made for people who have experienced a serious loss and want a cathartic experience to relive that sadness. That isn't an accusation or judgment, I'm just saying that's what it is. So when I say that I felt purposefully misled and tricked by this movie, it's coming from the perspective of someone who is unable to comprehend it on an emotional level.On a positive note, the shot composition was gorgeous. Everything from the positioning of characters to the furniture in the background is meticulously and purposefully placed. The transition scenes where characters are traveling or having a thoughtful moment are incredibly tranquil and stunning. The last 5 minutes of this movie? Oh my god. After slogging through what felt like two and a half hours of nothing, the ending sequence almost made all of it worth it.

But how to define a Chinese viewer? I guess for this instance, if you can identify with any of the character shown in this movie, then you are the person this movie is narrating for. You probably need fluent English listening skills, native Chinese skills, and potentially some Italian opera background (which I didn't know could have been useful for this movie while some Caro mio ben started playing).Although, as a first-gen Chinese Canadian young adult, they don't have too good a line write for lots of Chinese conversations, plenty of slangs, expressions and idioms were still used in this movie in Chinese. And to be honest, I wouldn't even expect anyone Chinese who migrated out of China before secondary education system to half-understand them. So while I was crying so hard or being silent during some heart-breaking lines and emotion-inducing dark-humor scenes, I wasn't expecting or appreciating or the ""cultural outsiders"" to laugh so hard that I could not even hear the lines.This movie is a cultural mark. While commercially wide-released in North America as an Invitation for our fellow ""earth-er"" to have a taste of this, relatively, extreme representation of fraction of our ubiquitous life, WE REQUEST THE RESPECT WE DESERVE for what's our own, the emotions through the native Mando Chinese lineage.If you cannot identify as any of the character in the movie, don't read Chinese, don't have Mandarin-listening skills, or don't have a mediocre or even preliminary understanding of Mando Chinese cultural, please be a respectful spectator, just sit back and let the experience sink in. Don't try to laugh with the crowd, since one, it might not be funny before the line got translated into English subtitles, two, most of your crowd probably was already not ""behaving"", and three, you probably will look like a jerk or imbecile while all the native Chinese viewers sitting by you are tearing up so hard and they want to hear all the lines that were inaudible because of the nonsense laughter all around.

210,zzhou5,this movie is repulsive for the native Chinese,1,26 December 2019,"This movie is definitely meant to be a propaganda movie to unify the so-called big family of the Chinese all over the world, or to provoke some tears of overseas Chinese or to show westerners the humanity of communist China But for anyone with a smattering knowledge of modern Chinese history , this movie can be interpreted as a story of crime and punishment. First of all, the old granny is a communist cadre belonging to the privileged class in China, The communist party took over China, banished foreign powers ,slaughtered landlords and capitalists, and confiscated any domestic and foreign property. The communist reform turned out to be a catastrophe and anti-human. Now the granny witnessed her sons to emigrated to the west ,which she had denounced and whose values are totally in conflict with what she advocated in the communist China. Can I say it is the karma of the lonely granny ,whose revolutionary behavior once contributed to the evil of the communist China? Second , the story seems to be a memoir movie of the directer Lulu Wang ,who ,according to her biography , was also the second generation of a top Chinese communist bureaucrat and is bathed in the free western sunshine, enjoying the family fortune being snatched from china by means of corruption, while the Chinese people suffer from inhuman totalitarianism , I strongly suspect she had this movie financed via the party to improve the image of the country devoid of human right. Finally, the director is very inchoate in exploiting too much rhetoric skills but ignoring the true sentiments. I do not see their family feelings have any solid foundation , only their pretentious performance intended to be sentimental. Perhaps I can only identify with Billi in her suffering of deportation to a strange land and loneliness without family relatives. But all this suffering in the movie is caused by the communist party. just think about why the sons emigrated abroad. If China were really as good as the community party brags or promises . why would the second generation feel bothered to emigrate to the west, a better alternative than China as a place to live in and to propagate?",The Farewell

214,liuruiorp,A film that will be emblematic for all Chinese diaspora,8,17 September 2019,"This film has simply crept up on me. From the IMDB one paragraph description, I had expected this film to be quirky, smart, and potentially playing on some East Asian stereotypes. What I actually found as the film progressed, is that it's actually a film that speaks directly to me like no other film has ever done.Like the writer/director Lulu Wang, I too was born in mainland China (Beijing), and spent my earliest years living with my grandparents. I left Beijing when I was seven, and Wang left China when she was six. In the intervening years, English has become my predominant language, and my Mandarin has declined. Three years ago, my grandmother on my mother's side passed away. I was 26 at the time and 29 now, again a very similar age to Wang and the character of Bili in this film.What Wang articulates so authentically in this film is on one hand the eternal debate of Eastern Confucian values of family, duty and society versus Western liberty and individualism, and on the other the rapidly transforming modern China, where whole sections of cities are knocked down and rebuilt, at a pace that literally feels overnight. Bili's sense of displacement and sadness in the film is exacerbated by the fact that she feels her memories of her early childhood are literally erased from the records, as her old neighbourhood has been turned into a brand spanking new roundabout with a modernist sculpture in the middle of it.Needless to say, the above sense of displacement is something that I too have felt in recent visits to Beijing.For non-Chinese viewers of this film, I would imagine they too will get a sense of the authenticity of the writing, the wry observations of odd Chinese cultural phenomenon, and the endearing performances by the leads. But that sense of connection to the subject material will be unique to the millions of Chinese who have left China for US, Canada, Australia or Europe since the 1980s/1990s. So, even though I feel the film is cliche in some parts, and hence my 8/10 rating, it will always have a unique place for me personally.",The Farewell

Although my mandarin in not perfect I can easily tell the main characters relatives DO NOT sound like mainland chinese people when they speak. Its very obvious this was written by a Chinese-American. The whole setup that the story is based around (not telling the Grandmother that she's going to die) is as far as I know NOT common in China. My experience is quite the opposite that chinese people are very pragmatic and open about such things as life and death. On top of this the main character is really dull and hard to feel any kind of sympathy for. The story drags and is quite boring.

They say that even if you remove the main character, the plot of this movie would still be the same. Although this may be true, but in my opinion that is the point of this movie. Bili is supposed to be the passive observer that's telling the story and reflecting the deep cultural conflicts between Eastern and Western philosophy. This is supposed to be reflective of real life, and real life is not supposed to have much drama. For people expecting more plots and developments, I would say they chose the wrong movie to watch. I personally find it beautiful that everything played out just the way it did, and I am very appreciative of how real it felt.To me, this movie was beautifully written and shot, and it is quite moving and funny at the same time. I would say some of the humor may only be understood by people familar with Asian/Chinese culture, but that's not all there is to it. There are also some long shots that may be, but that's about the only thing negative I have to say about this movie.

Awkwafina is receiving a lot of praise for her performance in this film. It's fine. She does well enough, but she doesn't really have much to do in this film. She never expresses much emotion, she's rather monotonous. It fits the film, so she's doing rather well, but it's not evidence of her incredible acting or anything.

For Awkwafina no less...seriously?? If 90 minutes of moping is considered great acting, well then sure. I am a huge fan of original strories and storytelling (Roma, anybody!) I could care less about the next superhero or Star Wars movies - and I was looking forward to The Farewell based on the reviews and hype. Nope. I did enjoy the glimpse of daily life of a Chinese family, and the grandmother was enjoyable to watch (buzz for another Oscar contender? Really??)

242,farnswth-62919,"Nice, but it is Souffle, not Steak",6,2 August 2019,"The Farewell is a pleasant little film that you could take your mother to see, warm and in places, funny. Zhao Shuzhen and Awkwafina are fine actors. And it's not - for a change - about a comic action hero. But I would advise my fellow filmgoers to go with modest expectations, or risk disappointment. Film critics have fawned all over this film that just can't carry the weight of all that praise.The supposed insights about the 'immigrant experience' would be familiar to any Air Force brat or for that matter anyone in North America who has been transferred or had to leave home to seek work. Homesickness, nostalgia for the way one's home town used to look like, grief over relatives whose funerals one may have been unable to attend, these are great themes to explore, but only if the filmmaker hadn't tried to insist that these are experiences specific to immigrants at all let alone Chinese immigrants.Most unfortunately, the lie theme doesn't get explored beyond our being told that it is a good lie because it removes the emotional burden of dying from the patient. Awkwafina's character objects but never seriously challenges her family, say by asking them how stupid do they think Grandma is, that this lie won't succeed without Grandma's tacit collaboration? In which case, what is the point? There will be no sweet oblivion.None of the characters asks or considers the question of who is best able to manage, not just bear, the burden of this 'Tree of Knowledge'. If Grandma is indeed about to enter palliative care, who can best direct that burden, a loving family or the patient themselves? Instead, one of the characters offers up the same cultural relativism chestnut, delivered in tones of such maddening condescension I wanted to throw my popcorn at the screen.The not so compelling lie theme dispensed with, the film dissolves into a pile of irrelevance. Grandma is at least 15 years too young to be even a teenager during the Chinese civil war, but talks about it as if she were a veteran anyway. Wedding arranged for the pretext of bringing the family together to bid farewell involves a bride who is Japanese and the groom, Chinese. Given the long history of often bumpy relations between Japan and China, I doubt that the bride's ethnicity was chosen by accident, but it is one theme too many, it looked like it was thrown in just to try and make this film look more steak than souffle.I left glad I'd paid $7 (Tuesday discount at my local theatre) to see it - no less, but no more.",The Farewell

This is the topic of whether or not it's right to reveal a secret and possibly worry the person who you want to tell or keep it to yourself to shoulder that burden.

256,cjtracing,"Semi-Funny Farewell Examines A Challenging, Cultural Lie",9,22 February 2020,"The Farewell is a sweet, generational, and cultural humorous drama about a young, Chinese American New Yorker contesting her beloved grandmother's pending death. Billi (excellently performed with dramatic balance by comedian Awkwafina) is in disagreement with her parents, uncle, and aunts about withholding the terminal news from her grandmother Nia Nia. Billi keeps it mum with regret. The family wishes her farewell under the guise of Billi cousin's wedding, Nia Nia has no clue of her concealed death certificate.
Yes, by cultural practice, let her be happy leaving us in three months, the family reasoned with Billi. But, as Lulu Wang's film reveals, that kind of objective is not so easy to carry out, testing loyalties, morals, and emotions. What is brilliantly contrasting with The Farewell from other comedies addressing death is that it does not mock its theme trying to garnish sick or thoughtless laughter.
For a reason, The Farewell feels more realistic, and possibly for some audiences, saddening than it is funny. Yet, for me, it is intelligent, authentic, and the humor genuinely affecting. It may sense hidden. Wang's funny bone surfaces and tingles satisfactory thanks to her engaging narrative, direction, and marvelous performances from a talented, Asian cast. Shuzhen Zhao is wonderful as Nia Nia. The Farewell contains some bits of profanity, doses of tobacco puffing, a drunken man is briefly seen lying in his underwear, and there are, as noted above, thematic elements.",The Farewell

This is the kind of entertainment art that we need. Mentally stimulating, emotionally moving, thought provoking, a stimulator of soul searching and community building.We do not have access to art in the same way that prior generations did. Movies don't stay in theaters for a full year. There are not just three television channels, where the country can share a communal experience together en masse.

It shows the cultural shift in perspective between China and the US.I would urge to watch this movie with somebody who has Asian influence, if you're not familiar with the culture and if you are not familiar with US culture, I would recommend you watch it with a Western person. That is only needed, if you want to understand the details like the wedding scene, which some Western people would wonder why it's there.As an intercultural person this seems like the only movie I know, that was able to portray how it is to be part of Eastern and Western culture.

Or ""thats exactly what I say when I talk to family in China!"" I started bawling during the last scene when Billi says goodbye to Nai Nai and gets into the cab.

I am very happy that I saw it but I did not experience a tremendous emotional response to The Farewell. One big draw was Awkwafina; I was delighted to see her and her performance though I believe she has room to grow as an actor. Another aspect that attracted me was Lulu Chen's emigration experience.

Being completely turned off by the trailer I still wanted to give this film a chance. After a really moving performance from Awkwafina I walked out grinning ear to ear. This film really pulls on your heart strings as it portrays the emotional roller coaster of dealing with a loved one who is terminally ill. I myself have had to deal with this same drama only a few months before seeing this film so it really meant a lot to me. However, the only difference is we told our loved one about the illness she was facing. Which is something I found fascinating in this film. It is common in Chinese culture to not tell someone they have cancer. I thought director Lulu Wang did an excellent job capturing this. Many family members are dealing with different emotions and Lulu Wang was able to show you this in an almost fly on the wall scenario. I just felt like I was watching real life events, like for example the film, Manchester By The Sea.What really moved me was the performance from Awkwafina as the main character. She gave a performance that should hopefully raise eyebrows at the academy. She was a really easy character to connect to. All of us love our grandmothers and we want only the best for them and when you are watching them fade away as she did, it has to be agonizing and she did a hell of a job portraying it on screen.My only flaw with this film is that in the beginning of the third act the pacing really slows down at a wedding scene. I felt it was boring, however after that it picks back up and leaves you with a really heartfelt ending.I can not recommend this movie enough.

Ladies and gentleman, The Farewell is one of those films.This movie was a total pointless bore. There's no plot, no laughs, no truth and no artistry. Awkwafina's character has zero arc. By the end of the film, she's the same 30 year old spinster we meet at the beginning of the film. Throughout the movie, she's just a passive observer watching things happen and reacting to things happening around her and then the movie ends.It's sad that people rating this film so highly are doing it solely on the basis of ""representation"" and ""diversity"". Let's be honest, if the same movie was made about a white family, it would be immediately dismissed as Lifetime movie channel fodder. And no, I'm not white.In these ultra PC times, film critics and the public seem to award points for good intentions versus the actual merits of the movie.

There are so many great Asian and Asian American directors and films that go completely unnoticed by the general American public but shamelessly unremarkable stuff like The Farewell seems to grab the spotlight.I REALLY wanted to like this movie but as the film dragged on, I started realizing it had no point and nothing to say. For example, you could have completely removed Awkwafina's character and the film would have played out exactly the same. She is virtually inconsequential to the story.Having experienced a recent loss in my family, I was hoping to relate to the film but everything on screen felt phony and disingenuous.

While it is sensitive in parts, most of the time the story just drags on. It is also difficult to empathise with any of the characters as they're hardly really loving to each other and seem to be bickering and quite rude (maybe a cultural thing but the portrayal of their love was so difficult to believe).",The Farewell
283,sstmacxzy-18295,How do we face death?,7,29 November 2019,"7 stars for the story, the director did a great job to show the culture shocks between western countries and China. However, this is also a story that all of us can relate to.As a Chinese, who happened to be born in Changchun where this movie is filmed, I can't imagine someday I could see my hometown in a Hollywood movie. I like the way that the director showed some cultural factors about the northeast part of China. However, I have to express this is what the director wants to show the audience. Probably a little bit of bias came from the director's childhood memories when she used to live with her grandma in Changchun. People from western or other countries would like to see this kind of cultural difference, that is what catches the audience in the first place. Just be aware of what showed in the movie is not 100% Chinese life. For example, not like the mom mentioned in the movie, only families from countryside would hire some random people to cry on a funeral, on the one hand, tears show the grief to others, on the other hand, Chinese believe if you family is short of hands, bring more people to come to the funeral won't let the dead feel alone or scared to enter the other side of world.Back to the story itself, I can really feel the content. I believe about 60% of traditional Chinese families had the same experience as showed in the movie. How do we face death? That's the ultimate question. Indeed, in China, people would not like to talk much about death, young generations like me and Billy in the movie, we always are the last person to be informed that our relatives' death. My parents used to say, ""Don't worry about it, I don't want the XX's death affect your schoolwork or work"". That is not fair for us especially when you have good memories with XX. However, your parents really think this is the best way to keep you from grief and make you feel better. The most touching part for me is when Billy found her mom before the wedding and show her willingness to stay. That's the tough part of life, you cannot expect people feel nothing when their love's death. Then truth is you can only feel the grief that's all and that is the only thing you can do, people are so helpless when it comes to death. Sometimes, it feels like the dead never exist in the world, because nothing changed, everyone still needs to work, eat, and sleep every day. But it is us to carry on and keep moving to remember them in our hearts.
To add up, I appreciate what I see in this movie, some translation subtitles need to be more precise although I understand the Chinese are hard to translate in some points. Some lines are useless like Billy's uncle keeps repeating same words when he sent Billy to hotel.Okay finally, guess I will talk about actor's performance. Awkwafina did an amazing job to be as a granddaughter raised under American culture. Her performance maybe a little weird for some Chinese audience, but I like how she acts in the movie. Fxxk to those haters, I just like her melancholy born in nature! How come nobody talk about mom and grandmom's performance. To be honest, I never heard about these two actresses before. But I would see that is a typical Chinese grandmom, what a kind, independent female character, got sense of humour and carry the family even in that age. Besides, the mom even showed the in-law relationship problems in her acting. I don't know about families in western countries, all I know it's just the typical Chinese family. Overall, this is a great movie to watch to learn to reflect.",The Farewell
284,PDX777,Relatable & Powerful (Emotionally & Culturally),9,22 December 2019,"As a part of an overseas Chinese family residing in Thailand, this movie's theme grabs my attention when I first heard of it. Later on, after watching, it also grabs my emotion and my mind as I keep thinking about this emotionally-powerful tragic story and what it means for the culture.The belief of the family bearing the emotion from terminal illness or death for their loved ones is ubiquitous in cultures of the East, as I personally experience it in my family and learn from my peers, my parents and my country's history. As I grow up being a third-generation Thai (my great-grandparents are from China) and a Gen Z exposed to western cultures through internet and social medias, I feel distant from the believe of a person's life being a part of a whole family, but this movie makes me reevaluate that belief and helps me find better balance between keeping the heritage of my family and inserting western cultural believes into my own through the connection that I feel toward the protagonist's struggle. However, there is one issue; the trailer gives away the powerful dialogue about that particular belief making it feel less impactful when watching it with the movie. Still, I highly recommend ""The Farewell"" for those trying to find the cultural balance within yourselves.With Awkwafina nailing the leading role as Billi Wang, an aspiring writer and immigrant from China in the US who struggles to keep her emotion and understand her cultural background after learning of her Chinese grandmother dying of cancer, the message is clearly spoken in the film. Yet, it still finds a way to add Awkwafina's signature comedic energy from her previous works that comes out naturally with the dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, I get to see different characters with their own distinct identities and stances on this conflict create convincing dialogues that makes me feel the chemistry of being a real Chinese family. Added to that, the dialogues are not flooded with expositions leaving lots of stories being told through visuals and music which complement the story perfectly. In the end, however, the comedy and some visual storytelling might leave some confusion for audience not exposed to Chinese culture.Anyway, despite its minor flaws, the movie is outstanding as a personal storytelling visual art based on the writer and director's own experiences for the audience to connect and entertain and also a piece of cultural interpretation for the audience to evaluate and understand.",The Farewell

(and the china effect can affect the rating obviously)But the truth need to be told. The movie is bad, the execution is bad, the performances are bad (apart form the dying grand mother which is OK) the ending is awful.

289,mailalanli,Best film of 2019,10,12 December 2020,This movie will only appeal to people who understand the nuances of the Chinese culture.

It was a rollercoaster ride of emotions for me while watching ranging from laughing hysterically to crying hysterically. A must see film 10/10,The Farewell
290,p-49514,Mixed reviews but it's all about perspectives,7,16 December 2020,"I get why some people were brought to tears by this film and why some people hate its guts. For a lot of people who never had to move to a different country and had to separate from those that are closest to them and watched them grow up, and who never grew up in a big family or had a close relationship with their grandparents, the film probably tells a distant story that is hard to relate to. Not to mention the cultural aspect, the acting and emotions and certain scenes must be so foreign as they are quite accurately Chinese (at times embarrassingly so such as the fake crying at the cemetery and the taxi drivers soliciting customers, as these are not the best sides of China that Chinese people usually want on international silver screens). But for someone like myself, Chinese and having grown up within a big family in China with close relationship with my grandparents and having left home since the age of 17 for college, the film is pretty much me every time I'm visiting China. Even though my family never had to come up with a scheme to cover up someone's cancer, I can totally relate to the emotions, how as my grandparents grew older every time I was leaving China at the end of my visit my grandparents would get emotional, as they don't know if it'd be the last time seeing me. And how I know that if one of them were to get sick the whole family would hide it from me so that I would not worry as I am so far away and there is nothing I can do, until they can't anymore. It's quite common for families in China to try to hide the news that someone's got cancer from the patient themselves as it's widely believed that the fear does more harm than anything else. But I also get the western perspective that ""it's not your call"". So it begs the question, that what would I do, as someone who has spent an equal amount of time in both worlds, when faced with a situation like that. And more importantly, how do I trade off when it comes to pursuing my own dreams vs. fulfilling my responsibility as a son and grandson, and (sadly) how should I identify myself in a world where China and Chinese perspectives are drifting increasingly apart from those of the West. That being said, the film does feel slow at times and there are a few filler scenes that are probably better off without. All in all, I get why a film zooming deep into Chinese family dramas gets mixed reviews. It's a niche market. This is not your typical Kung Fu / Jackie Chan movie after all.",The Farewell
291,yeomanscholar,"Insightful, Beautiful, Hilarious, and Heartbreaking",10,3 January 2021,"Re-watching The Farewell tonight cemented it on my very short list of movies everyone should watch.First, and most importantly, it's about real humans, and driving feelings/ideas in their lives. Family. Community. Memory. Emotion. Lies, truth, good lies, bad truths.Secondly, and equally importantly, it's really, really well made. Gorgeous soft red-blue colors. Tremendous acting, framing, editing. Tension. Release. All the pieces of a great story, put together well.Highlights sans context:
A lying (but are they lying if everyone knows(?) they are lying?) Family slow-walks toward the camera like gangsters. Mirroring an earlier to-camera slow-walking individual.

292,titusf-87140,A moving and heartfelt film with excellent acting - but it ultimately falls flat,7,12 March 2021,"""The Farewell"", whose Chinese title translates to ""don't tell her,"" deals wonderfully with the pain of losing a loved one (the grandmother who's diagnosed with terminal cancer) as well as the inner turmoil suffered by migrants everywhere as they negotiate a separate identity from their origins. The acting and directing is superb and brilliantly captures the intense non-verbal communication that goes on in negotiating one's own complex feelings and ones disagreements with family members.The linchpin of the story is that the children do not want to tell the grandmother about her cancer diagnosis, because they fear that they would make her so afraid of death that telling her would ruin the little time she has left. The part of the family that remained in China/emigrated to Japan argues strongly for this, while the American part is extremely uncomfortable with it. Unfortunately, the film does not go very far beyond simply having characters disagree about this, not going much further into the implications beyond orientalist bromides on how family-conscious and non-individualist the Chinese supposedly are. The elder son literally says that the Americans are afraid to bear the burden about knowing about Grandmother's impending death and want to offload it onto her by just telling her. However, we are shown multiple ways in which Grandmother might want to change her life if she was aware that she doesn't have much time left, and she herself kept her husband's diagnosis from him - why not ask her if she was happy to have kept it from him?Clearly the writer/director Lulu Wang is aware of the harmful aspects of ""stiff upper lip"" culture in this particular family, where nobody tells anyone about things that are not going well for them, and there is always a gulf of unspoken worries between people. But why not drill down on this point a little bit more? I get that the movie is autobiographical, but I was disappointed that the element of ""fiction"" in attempting actual resolutions of these conflicts or at least a further exploration of them was so underdeveloped. I get that it is realistic that people are loth to actually discuss what bothers them and prefer to fight proxy battles on seemingly unrelated topics, but I believe that interesting films usually go a bit deeper into the issues that they are exploring rather than merely showing them on-screen.However, this criticism of the story is more than made up for by the excellent acting.",The Farewell

294,mikkeii,Disappointed but then again what was the expectation anyway,2,10 November 2019,"There were a plethora of Chinese studios in the intro so it was pretty clear that the theme/content would be sterilized. The whole 'united' as one is such bull crap and everyone knows it. I'm surprised that Awkwafina decided to take on this role, she didn't seem like the sell-out type. Was a big fan of her music and her comedic style both on-screen and from podcasts.This whole movie is done so IRONICALLY that they're de-humanizing the 'West' for their individualism and portraying the spineless culture that is post-culture revolution China to be the 'all wise'.Grandma's acting is also just 101 Chinese theatre, not sure what directions were given but it's so typical. The style is basically on par with the sketches you see on the annual Chinese New Year Gala.This whole movie is insane, the notion that it should receive any recognition is insane. It's total propaganda, fully filtered and down your throat. Sure some side characters threw in a few lines to rebut the theme of the movie, but the MAIN char drives the narrative in the end.Very disappointed in seeing Awkwa taking on projects like this. It doesn't bridge any gaps, it's just a reminder for the Chinese who managed to move away from the bs that is that country that they are still tethered back home in some way or form. The patriotism in this is blind and without substance. If you love your country or culture (not that Chinese has any since the revolution), then do your best to make it better, not circle jerk it till your hand gets sores.",The Farewell

While I'm not Chinese, it reminds me of the things that I missed back home - family dinner, weddings, cuisines, and hustle bustle of the city I grew up in. It's a painful reminder that as a lone soul in my family that migrates in America, I might not be there if something happens to a close relatives and put a trust on my family to take care of it.

Yes, it is slow-paced. Yes, it might seem uninteresting. I've read that Awkwafina's role might be irrelevant in the aftermath of the story. Yes, maybe. So what? That's how life goes.. Not every movie has to involve explosions, super lasers and bazookas, heroes and bad guys. This is a true portrayal of a dysfunctional family, of the differences between East and West and should get you thinking. For me, the story moves a little bit like The Florida Project, it just grabs a small period of someone's life and the rest is up to your imagination. Not every movie ends when the credits show up.. If you want to enjoy this film, notice the soundtrack, notice the camera work, the silences, the dialogues, the acting... What an amazing movie!
