0,MartinHafer,"A lot like ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" but with far fewer laughs and far fewer interesting actors.",6,13 August 2018,"Many years ago, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" brought together a lot of funny people and some excellent writing to create a neat comedy . ""Rat Race"" is an attempt to create a similar sort of film, though the results are very uneven...much more so than the original.The story begins in Las Vegas. Seven different people find a special coin in the slot machine--one that tells them to immediately see the boss (John Cleese). When they all do, they learn that they all have a chance to win $2,000,000. How? The money is supposedly in a dufflebag inside a locker in Silver City, New Mexico...and each is given a copy of the key. And, the first one there gets it all! And, knowing human nature, you know they won't just decide to work together and split the money....greed sets in big time!
Some of the stories are very funny--particularly Jon Livitz and his family trip to the Barbie museum. That one made me laugh out loud many times. A few are just okay. And, a few are just not funny at all and are complete wastes of time--such as Rowan Atkinson and his ridiculously unfunny character as was the guy who talked funny because he had a stud in his tongue. Both were tiresome....and a tiny bit of them would have been enough. Overall, an incredibly uneven movie that really could have used a re-write....and a huge infusion of humor.",Rat Race
1,Prismark10,Rat Race,3,27 July 2021,"Rat Race is an all star reworking of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.A group of people set off from Las Vegas to Silver City in New Mexico to win $2,000,000 hidden in a locker.It is organised by a casino mogul Donald Sinclair (John Cleese) who has invited some high rollers to place bets on who might win the prize.The humour is laboured. The jokes are unfunny. It is all tired and lazy.Sometimes being silly can be fun. This was generally uninspired as the actors had little to go on. Cuba Gooding Jr mugs it as a disgraced referee. He is one of three Oscar winners in the cast.Only Jon Lovitz got some decent laughs as a Jewish man who ended up in Klaus Barbie museum and then later drives Hitler's car.",Rat Race
2,lee_eisenberg,"OK as long as it doesn't directly try to copy ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World""",7,5 October 2006,"""Rat Race"" has widely been viewed as a semi-remake of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"". Personally, I think that no movie can equal the latter. So, as long as this one doesn't actually try to ape that one, it comes out pretty good. Once again portraying a gaggle of people in a wild race to try and find an exorbitant amount of money, the movie is mostly an excuse to be silly, not really focusing on greed the way that ""IAMMMMW"" did.Ignoring that, it's basically a litany of hilarity. Whether it's John Cleese's slimy weirdo, Rowan Atkinson's narcoleptic Italian (why didn't they cast Roberto Benigni in that role?), Jon Lovitz in Hitler's car, Cuba Gooding Jr. driving a most unusual bus, Whoopi Goldberg learning a lesson about squirrels, or something else, they just go all out here. All in all, it's good for a fun time, if nothing else. Also starring Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart, Seth Green, Vince Vieluf, Kathy Najimy, Kathy Bates and Dave Thomas.",Rat Race
3,jboothmillard,Rat Race,6,17 March 2005,"An all star bunch of comedians are in this roller coaster film from director Jerry Zucker (Airplane!, Ghost). Some ordinary people use gambling slot machines and some manage to win a special coin. They go to where the coin instructs and then Donald Sinclair (named after the man who inspired Basil Fawlty, and played by John Cleese) is explaining about a town called Silver City in New Mexico. He then gives a bunch of ""ordinary"" people six identical keys that open a locker to $2,000,000. Basically, the first to get to the cash is the one who keeps it. Then when the pistol is fired the ""race"" begins. Many wacky and hilarious things happen to these racers. Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson) is hit by a car by Wayne Knight, and survives. Vera Baker (Whoopi Goldberg) and her daughter Merrill Jennings (Lanai Chapman) drive a rocket car that can travel at Mach-one speed. Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.) drives a bus full of women dressed as Lucille Ball/Lucy Ricardo. Duane Cody (Seth Green) and his brother Blaine (Vince Vieluf) strap a cow to a hot air balloon. Nick Schaffer (Road Trip's Breckin Meyer) gets tossed about in a helicopter by Tracy Faucet (Road Trip's Amy Smart) trying to kill her boyfriend (Dean Cain). Finally, Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz) gets his wife (Kathy Najimy) and kids into trouble speaking and looking like Hitler, and they stole his car. Also starring Gloria Allred, Dave Thomas as Harold Grisham, Paul Rodriguez as Gus the Cabbie, Kathy Bates as The Squirrel Lady, Smash Mouth and Rance Howard as Feed the Earth Spokesman. Good!",Rat Race
4,Tweekums,Plenty of laughs but a weak ending,6,12 January 2012,"This film follows in the tradition of such films as 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' and 'The Cannonball Run' where a cast of mostly well known actors, in this case including Rowan Atkinson, Seth Green, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Whoopi Goldberg, take part in a madcap race with no rules. Here they are racing from Las Vegas to Silver City in New Mexico where a prize of two million dollars awaits the winner. The race has been organised by Casino owner John Cleese who, unbeknownst to the racers is running a book with a bunch of high-stakes gamblers as to who will win. The racers were decided randomly and include very different people; a disgraced football referee, a family on vacation, a narcoleptic Italian, a mother who has only just reunited with her daughter, a lawyer and a couple of dubious characters. The obvious method of transport is put out of commission as all planes are cancelled after an amusing attempt to prevent other racers; this means they must go by land apart from the lawyer who befriends a helicopter pilot it is just a pity for him she decides to say hello to her cheating boyfriend on the way. The contestants get into numerous scrapes en route including stealing a bus, a jet-car, a hot air balloon and a car that once belonged to Hitler! This film contained many laugh out loud moments as well as one or two cringe-worthy moments; unfortunately the final scene fell into the latter category; after all the back-stabbing on the way it was a pity to have such a saccharine ending. The cast did an okay job although I think I can say none of them would consider this their greatest outing. It is a pity that the film contained some fairly crude humour as apart from that it is the sort of film children would enjoy, unfortunately because of those moments a lot of parents won't want their young children watching this.",Rat Race
5,BA_Harrison,Should... Have... Bought... A.... Squirrel!,9,10 April 2011,"Rat Race is one of those eccentric capers in which a bunch of crazy characters (usually played by a whole host of familiar faces) risk life and limb to compete for a fortune; in this case, the prize is $2million dollars stashed in a railway locker in Mexico City, the contestants are those lucky enough to win special tokens from slot machines in the casino belonging to wealthy Las Vegas gambling magnate Donald P. Sinclair (John Cleese), and the rules are simple—whoever gets to the money first keeps it!The formula is as old as the hills, having started back in '63 with It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, and continued through the 60s, 70s and 80s with films like The Great Race, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, The Cannonball Run and Scavenger Hunt; in less experienced hands, this kind of thing can easily fall flat on its face, but director Jerry Zucker is a man with a degree in zany from the University of Madcap, and with an incredible cast and a script that fires witty one-liners like a belt-fed machine gun, he delivers one of the finest ever examples of this comedy sub-genre.Of course, this kind of comedy is far from sophisticated, a relentless series of zany events and visual gags that escalate in madness as the competitors get closer and closer to their goal, and as such, it isn't going to appeal to everyone (people who think that The Royal Tenenbaums is funny, for example). On the other hand, those of us who can appreciate the magnificent sight of a cow suspended from a hot air balloon or the genius of a Jewish family mistakenly visiting a Klaus Barbie museum will have an absolute blast.Rowan Atkinson is absolutely brilliant as a Latin Mr. Bean with narcolepsy; Kathy Bates is unforgettable as the crazy squirrel woman; Whoopie Goldberg and Lanei Chapman break the land speed record in a rocket car (funnier than it sounds); Vince Vieluf and Seth Green play dumb beautifully; and Amy Smart has a great butt (I know that's not relevant to the comedy, but I just had to mention it).The film loses a point for a rather unsatisfying finalé (matters come to a head at a charity gig headlined by pop rockers Smashmouth—remember them?), but overall this is a fine comedy, one that benefits from excellent repeat value and a whole shed-load of quotable dialogue.",Rat Race
6,Quinoa1984,Fine solo comedy debut from the other Zucker,6,15 August 2001,"Jerry Zucker, who was once part of the great comic trio ZAZ (famous for Airplane, Top Secret, Ruthless People and Naked Gun), now directs his first comedy, or rather his first solo comedy.  Now after Ghost and First Knight, he takes a plunge into a type of film that takes after It's a mad, mad world.  Is it better than that, well I can't say since I never saw that movie.  But I can say this- Rat Race is a funny comedy with some funny characters in funny situations.  The characters are 6+ people who are invited to be apart of a race to get $2 million.  Then what follows is a long yet mostly reqarding string of gags, pratfalls, outrageous jokes and in your face comedy.  Nothing like the other parodies he and his counterparts Abrahams and his brother Zucker did and still do, but it's still worthy, and above all watchable, in a season of un-funny comedies (well, mostly anyway).  Funniest characters go to Rowan Atkinson (of Mr. Bean fame), John Cleese, Jon Lovitz and Seth Green.  Flaws: a little poor in rational things (although this shouldn't matter to most people) and a very very weak ending.  Otherwise, Go!  B+",Rat Race
7,Boba_Fett1138,One of the most enjoyable movies of the past few years.,9,30 April 2004,"The fun level of this movie is incredible high which makes this movie also one of the most enjoyable ones of the past few years, despite its flaws.It's hard to say what it is that makes this movie a good comedy. Probably it's because of the high fast pace and the many story lines about the many characters that race to $2.000.000. Because of the high pace there are plenty of jokes and comical situations, most of them are predictable but for some reason it doesn't make them less fun. A great execution by the filmmakers. Of course some of the jokes are just plain lame but that goes for all comedies.The cast is full with big comedy names. I was surprised to see how comically talented Cuba Gooding Jr. was. All of the characters have their own storyline that are all told in a great way with as a result that all of those story lines are made interesting and fun enough to care and to be interested in all of them.It's a shame that the ending is disappointing and in a way predictable but luckily it doesn't ruin the rest of the movie entirely.Very well executed comedy with an incredible high fun level.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rat Race
8,view_and_review,Rat Race was Fast Paced,7,27 June 2007,"This movie sneaked up and bit me like nobody's business. No way did I think this movie would be good or even funny. It ended up being both. I mean, it was genuinely funny. I am always skeptical of all star casts because the hopes are higher and it is difficult for those hopes to be realized.The movie attacked the plot from several different angles. Each angle being a different participant of the game to get to the money first. Some characters and some scenarios were funnier than others, but they all held their own. It ended up being a feel good story in the end which added some extra flavor to it all.",Rat Race
9,anaconda-40658,Funny but No Smokey and the Bandit.,6,19 August 2015,"Rat Race (2001): Dir: Jerry Zucker / Cast: Cuba Gooding Jr., Seth Green, Whoopi Goldberg, Amy Smart, Rowan Atkinson: Comedy that walks a fine line between hilarity and stupidity. It is about motivation and greed. A group of tycoons decide to stage a race where the winner receives a substantial amount of money. People are chosen pending upon those whom find a token in a slot machine. It involves various subplots climaxing with a worthwhile message. Director Jerry Zucker is at best with slapstick humour but this hardly rates up there with Top Secret or Airplane. Some scenes misfire such as the ladies getting into the jet, or a family attempting to communicate with Nazis using sign language. The ending does present a great twist with its message but few of the cast are really funny. Cuba Gooding Jr. is interesting as a former referee who cannot seem to live down a bad coin toss. Seth Green is also funny as a schemer who sees this race as an opportunity. Among the performances that are below par are Whoopi Goldberg who can be a great comic but she overacts in this film. Amy Smart is terrible as a helicopter pilot dealing with boyfriend issues. Rowan Atkinson shows up to waste our time with a Mr. Bean performance under a different name. Car chase films are rarely funny but this one can be credited as a technically well made road kill about the motivation of greed. Score: 6 / 10",Rat Race
10,elo-equipamentos,Mad Mad Mad World bad Sequel!!!!,6,9 March 2018,"Jerry Zucker tryed made another Mad Mad World badly by the way, the unique character who deserves some coments is Jon Lovitz which has good and funny scenes mainly like Hitler on speech to World War 2's former soldiers and when he has to running on Hitler's car and meeting an angry motorcycle's gang, Whoopi Goldberg and Rowan Atkinson are barely miscasting, lost in this mess, John Cleese has some goods jokes and Cuba driving a bus with a lot of Lucy's is a clever scene, too little to so many characters....Resume:First watch: 2004 / How many: 3 / Source: Cable TV-DVD / Rating: 6.25",Rat Race
11,namashi_1,Funny and Stupid!,6,3 June 2010,"Inspired by, and with the same basic plot of the evergreen 60's cult-classic, 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World', 'Rat Race' pays homage to it's inspiration. Jerry Zucker makes a stupid flick, but one can't deny that you laugh and some sequences are simply superb in this 2001 flick.'Rat Race' is about six teams of people given a task of racing 500 + miles from a Las Vegas casino to a train station in Silver City, New Mexico, where a storage locker contains two million dollars. The first team to reach the locker wins and gets to keep the money. The climax however is the biggest downer, it's narrow and takes away all the cherry. Andy Breckman, the writer of this zany combo, could've easily come up with a much better culmination. Nonetheless, it's a decent fare! Now to the acting: Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic. Cuba Gooding Jr is loud, which is the demand of his character. John Cleese is terrific. Seth Green is another scene-stealer, the talented rock star is in top form. Kathy Bates in a brief role, is superb! Amy Smart is bombastic. Jon Lovitz is over-the-top! Others are fine.'Rat Race' deserves a watch, but please lock your brains at your drawer before switching on this one!",Rat Race
12,StevePulaski,"""Life is nothing' but a fat, rat race!""",9,23 September 2011,"Rat Race doesn't score well in the highest denominator of comedy, but it does score big laughs and big smiles while it runs in circles hectically for almost two hours. Yet again, I revisit another film I idolized as a child. This was probably one of the first ""truly adult"" films I watched at a very young age. I've mentioned before I watched a lot of inappropriate things as a child, but somethings, left a permanent mark on me as a child and Rat Race is certainly one of them.Sometimes, people ask me what got interested and familiar with film and I have to say Rat Race. This was the first film that introduced me to all the big named celebrities at the time. Everyone in this film is currently an active celebrity and has a number of movies under their belt, and I knew everyone's name by the second viewing. So, in terms of actors, I can honestly say, this one got me the most familiar with many of them.The story is on its own medicine; The eccentric owner of a hotel resort named Donald Sinclair (Cleese) creates a new game to entertain the high-rollers of the casino where he will place six golden tokens in slot machines. Whoever gets a token, will be given a key. A key that opens a special locker in a train station in Silver City, New Mexico. In the locker is a duffel bag filled with $2 million. Whoever gets there first, claims the money. Simple as that.The people involved are played by Breckin Meyer, Cuba Gooding Jr., Amy Smart, Jon Lovitz, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Seth Green, Lanei Chapman, and Vince Vieluf. Clearly, nothing shy of an ensemble comedy cast. After the rules are explained, the gang runs around like rats in a maze doing everything they can to get from Vegas to New Mexico as quickly as possible.As one can imagine, they run into nothing but sticky, and undeniably hilarious, situations which causes grief on their part. It's classic laugh-at-someone-else's-misery-comedy executed very well. The film sort of mixes classics like Stanley Kramer's It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Scavenger Hunt. Both films involved run of the mill situations, and characters struggling to make the next move half the time.The only downside here, is the film gets carried away with itself. It's a bit too contrived, and very coincidental. But in a way it has to be to keep the comedy and action at a consistent level, and the irony and fun existing. Despite its own medicine being a bit too strong, Rat Race combines a great score along with it. The music in this film matches pitch perfectly to the stressful scenes, and the tense atmosphere these characters are clearly occupying.Also equipped with delightful cameos, hilarious little side-stories, one of the best opening intros in recent memory, and an unexpecting and cherished end scene that shows even when consumed with greed and self-absorption that people are still likely to do admirable things, Rat Race is nothing shy of funny and well-made comedy. The audience it will attract is interesting because it can be fans of a good cast, fans of craziness in films, fans of classic cinema, fans of just good films, or a combination of every type. It's a universally appealing film that stands out for more than just its actors, but its message and its execution is all just remarkable.Starring: Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., Seth Green, Jon Lovitz, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart, Kathy Najimy, Lanei Chapman, Vince Vieluf, Dave Thomas, Wayne Knight, Kathy Bates, and Dean Cain. Directed by: Jerry Zucker.",Rat Race
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,So funny!,8,14 November 2007,"I always wanted to see Rat Race but I never did, don't know why, but I thought of it last night while I was renting some movies. I watched it last night and I have to say that I cannot believe that I missed out on this film! I thought that Rat Race is one of the funniest movies I have seen. As silly and outrageous as the humor is, I think that's just what I needed to put me in a good mood. The cast in Rat Race is absolutely perfect, they couldn't have picked a more comedic cast, not only that, but they all clicked so well together and made the film just an absolute blast to watch. Not to mention, cows are just getting a reputation as the perfect comedic relief, just look at not only Rat Race, but Twister, lol. The story is extremely clever, just how far most people would go to get money in their pockets.Donald P. Sinclair is a huge millionaire, he's so rich in fact, that he and his other rich buddies place the most obscene bets and they've just come up with the most cruel one of all. In a Las Vegas casino, several people have won a coin saying that they've won something. Donald has place two million dollars in a locker in Silver City, New Mexico. At first the group just laughs at him feeling like they've been scammed, but they think about it, and decide to just go for it. They all have to travel over two hundred miles while being watched by the rich group is watching them and betting on who is going to win the cash.Rat Race is incredibly clever and just a whole lot of fun to watch. Another great thing about this film is that it puts you in a great mood, you gotta love the comedies that can't stop make you laughing out loud. I think my favorite team was without a doubt Seth Green and his brother, they were just classic. I loved it when they had to stop all the flights from getting out so that they could have the same head start. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun comedy and deserves a better rating on IMDb, trust me, it really is that funny.8/10",Rat Race
14,=G=,Nonstop wackiness,6,15 April 2002,"In ""Rat Race"", a Las Vegas casino magnate selects a motley bunch of people at random, gives them keys to a public locker containing $2 million in cash in a town 500+ miles away, and tells them to go for it. What ensues is nonstop wackiness as the characters try to beat each other to the cash. A gag-a-minute, this flick is packed with unbridled and unabashed silliness in a sort of contemporary Vaudeville-meets-Hollywood road trip format. Well worth a look for those with a taste for unsophisticated, wacky comedy.",Rat Race
15,MovieAddict2016,"Rat Race proves, it's a mad, mad, mad, mad, world!",10,5 August 2002,"RAT RACE (2001)(4/5 STARS)StarringROWAN ATKINSON JOHN CLEESE WHOOPI GOLDBERG CUBA GOODING, JR SETH GREEN JON LOVITZ BRECKIN MEYER AMY SMART WAYNE KNIGHTDirected by JERRY ZUCKER Written by ANY BRECKMANFrom the very beginning of RAT RACE I knew it was going to be hilarious. The all-star comedic cast alone draws you to the movie, much less the jokes themselves. But let me tell you, the jokes did not fall flat at all. I don't know how many times I laughed, but it was countless. Unlike most comedies, RAT RACE delivers the whole way through, then has a HUGE comedy scene during an already funny movie (a few in particular among many, such as the airport scene, the helicopter scene, The Lucy Bus and the Hitler scene.)Basically a remake of the 1969 film IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD, WORLD, the plot of the movie is a little different, and goes a little something like this: A billionaire tycoon named Donald Sinclair (Cleese) puts gold coins inside 6 slot machines in his hotel, to draw people on a game of his to be the first to get to Mexico City, and find a million dollars stored in a locker at a train station. First one there, wins it all. We find that a football referee (Gooding) who has made the worst call on a play in history, two money seeking brothers (GREEN) looking to sue the hotel, a mother (Goldberg) just reunited with her daughter she gave away years ago, a man taking his family on their first vacation in years (Lovitz), an uptight young man (Breckin Myer) who finally takes a risk gambling one coin into a slot machine, and last but definitely not least a Frenchman named Enrico Polini (Atkinson) all find a coin. After being let in on Sinclair's game, at first they all say they won't go after the money. Then it begins. ALL of them rush away after the money, except Breckin Meyer's character, which leaves to take a flight home. On the way however, he meets a young female helicopter pilot (AMY SMART) who agrees to fly him to Mexico City, unaware of the little gamble. Later she is let in on the secret however, and she agrees to head to Mexico with him anyway.All the characters are completely loveable, especially Atkinson's. There're some famous cameos in this film as well, to name two are Kathy Bates and the band Smash mouth. There're a lot of interesting things about this film. One, is that it's the first to have two African-American actors in one movie together. Two, the character progression and introduction is done so well, it's incredible. It's truly amazing how good a comedy CAN be, and this is a good reference to look at if you're filming comedy. Another thing this comedy has, is the fact that while you're rooting for everyone, you wouldn't REALLY care if your character doesn't get the million. That's just the way the movie goes. And the end, unlike most comedies is truly great, and while a bit predictable what action the characters will take, we never guess HOW they do.If it's Donald Sinclair betting on who's going to throw up first, to your favorite characters doing wild and zany things, RAT RACE proves, it's truly a MAD,  MAD,  MAD, MAD WORLD , full of laughter and other great things, too many of which to wrap up in this comment! 4/5 STARS",Rat Race
16,OllieSuave-007,Crazy and unfunny race.,4,4 March 2014,"This movie had the potential to be funny, where a group of billionaires led by a Las Vegas casino owner all made a bet to see which group of six strangers will be able to race from Vegas to Silver City, New Mexico to retrieve $2 million hidden in a locker. The first one to get there gets to keep all of the money.The plot sounds fun enough, but the movie is basically just a bunch of crazy people pulling stunts and going pathetic antics to try to get the cash. The jokes are childish and stupidly slapstick and the humor is all forced comedy - no substance. It was great to see an all-star cast, but the acting was just below average and the ending was a downer. If you are a fan of Jerry Zucker's comedy spoofs, skip this one and check out his other movies like Top Secret, Airplane and the Naked Gun movies. Grade D-",Rat Race
17,FeastMode,my notes,7,1 July 2019,Very funny with a great cast and fun premise. this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. there are lots of parts that make no sense and lots of cheesy/campy parts. but still very enjoyable along with some nostalgia (about 4 viewings),Rat Race
18,bowmanblue,"Very silly, but highly watchable",7,10 October 2016,"There are some movies that are too dumb to watch and there are those that are fun to watch because they're so dumb. 'Rat Race' definitely falls into the latter. The plot – or what little there is of one – centres around an eccentric billionaire from Las Vegas (played to perfection by the legendary John Cleese) offering eight strangers the chance to win two million dollars, if they can be the first to reach the briefcase full of loot some five hundred miles away. What follows is your average 'road movie.' Therefore, in the grand tradition of such greats as 'The Cannonball Run' it's basically a series of sketches depicting the exploits of the eight sets of chancers as they lie, cheat and manipulate their way across the American desert in order to claim the money.It could be just average, but what definitely makes it worth watching is its stellar cast. I've already mentioned John Cleese (who isn't in it enough for my liking!), but you also have such greats as Rowen Atikinson, Whoopie Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr and John Lovitz. With a cast containing that lot it was always going to be better than your average adult comedy. And, yes, it probably is more geared towards adults. Although most of it could actually be suitable for children as well, there are a few scenes here and there that you wouldn't really want to explain to someone younger than a teenager! Some may criticise it for having little 'character development,' but it is a film loaded with different characters and it's not overly long, so it was always going to be geared towards laughs over depth and substance.Ultimately, Rat Race is the kind of film you can have on in the background while you do some colouring or play with your phone – it won't matter too much that you've missed a bit here and there – you'll still pick up the plot pretty quickly and raise a smile at whatever ludicrous antic is going on. It's certainly good fun if you're not expecting too much and just want a silly giggle. The cast appear to be having fun while they make it and there's no reason you shouldn't either.",Rat Race
19,lesleyharris30,"Better than Average Comedy with a Very Positive and Energetic Cast,",7,30 October 2013,"Rat Race is a good movie with a pretty good storyline that is without a doubt more original and a lot funnier than a lot of comedies similar to this (Road Trip,Dude Where's My Car,etc) and a very good cast that are funny and energetic from start to finish.The movie was definitely just set up for a lot of funny mishaps between the different,this usually bothers me when the story is set up just for laughs,most of them being visual,but I overall enjoyed in in this,it was fast paced and spaced out the amount of time for each character well.My favourite storyline is either Jon Lovitz,mainly because the dialogue between him and his wife and kids was hilarious and if they had their own Vacation type of movie I would definitely watch it,or Cuba Gooding Jr.,his character was really funny because of how competitive he was and I found the situations he was put in some of the most enjoyable,also it was a very different role him.The only storyline I didn't really enjoy was Whoopi Goldberg and Lanei Chapman,I found their characters irritating (especially Goldbergs) and the situations they were put in to (especially the squirrel one) was just stupid and didn't make me laugh.Rat Race is in no way a perfect comedy,but its fun and different cast should keep many people entertained and many parts are funny enough for you to ignore the parts that wern't.Wealthy man Donald Sinclair (John Cleese) sets up a race between six groups of people in which the first to make it to a locker in New Mexico will receive $2 million.",Rat Race

At this point in time, a young straight-arrow lawyer (Breckin Meyer) is about to fly home to Chicago, after attending a bachelor party. A mother (Whoopi Goldberg) is set to meet the daughter she gave up for adoption some twenty odd years ago. Two young punks are plotting to arrange a fall in a hotel, meriting a lawsuit. Also, an Italian gentleman (Rowan Atkinson) is enjoying his visit to America and a football referee (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is hiding out from a bonehead call that was widely criticized. And, last but not least, a harried father (Jon Lovitz) is taking his family on a vacation in Vegas. All of these people play the slots and end up receiving a token to a special buffet luncheon. It is over lunch that they learn that there is a 2 million dollar fortune locked up in a train station locker in New Mexico and they are all being given keys. As the casino owner (John Cleese) explains, the first one to reach the locker will get the money. He shoots off a gun and the race is on! With the local airport shut down, these folks hop into cars, ambulances, helicopters, trains, and buses to try to capture the big bucks. Who will be victorious? This is an updated version of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" that still dishes up truckloads of laughs. Just watch the goofy squirrel saleswoman (Kathy Bates) send folks to their doom or the creepy trip to the Klaus Barbie museum by Lovitz' family and you will be shaking with laughter. There are way too many happenings to list here but they all add up to a supreme gigglefest. The cast is a marvel, with the players listed above getting help from Amy Smart, Kathy Najimy, Dean Cain, Dave Thomas, Seth Green, Paul Rodriguez, Wayne Knight, and more. Lovitz, especially, is too funny for words. Costumes, sets, script, direction, and production are terrific while the number of sight gags is great as well.

One of the funniest moments in the film for me is when Amy Smart's character gets angry at her boyfriend for cheating on him and she goes psycho on him, and Rowan Atkinson's character was really just Mr. Bean as Enrico Pollini but he was still amazing! plus I loved the scenes him and Wayne Knight had together. The ending was just perfect in my opinion, and there are so many hilarious gags to enjoy as well, plus Seth Green and Vince Vieluf are hilarious as the two crook brothers. It's very well made and written for the most part, and if your not rolling with laughter, You'll at least be chuckling, plus John Cleese was very good in his role. I loved the scene where they search for the heart that they lost as that was very funny, plus I also loved the squirrel segment with Kathy Bates!. This is a very funny film, that often had me ins stitches, as it's really good fun, with a great story, and hilarious performances, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Jerry Zucker does a great! job here with excellent camera work, cool angles, and just keeping the film hilarious and at a very fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. Breckin Meyer is fantastic in his role, he had this easygoing charm that I loved, he was also great with Amy Smart, this guy is quite underrated in my opinion, I loved him here!. Cuba Gooding Jr. is hilarious as the bone headed Ref who cost the Dallas Cowboys the game, as he did so many hilarious things, he just rocked!, especially loved the scene with him and the Lucille Ball imitators on the bus that was a scream!. Seth Green and Vince Vieluf are hilarious as the two crook brothers, and stole a lot of the scenes I loved them!. Whoopi Goldberg is OK in her role I'm not really a big fan. Lanei Chapman is good in her role I liked her. Jon Lovitz is surprisingly funny and effective in his role, because he usually annoys me. Rowan Atkinson is amazing as always and is amazing here, now he is basically just playing Mr. Bean as Enrico Pollini but it's still very funny, he brought a lot of laughs to the film!. John Cleese is good in his role just wished he had more screen time. Amy Smart is very cute and is quite funny in her role, especially loved the scene where she went psycho on her boyfriend. Wayne Knight is hilarious as usual, I loved him, he worked well with Atkinson. Kathy Bates is funny as the Squirrel lady I liked her. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",Rat Race

Packed with an all star cast of wonderful characters endure so much to reach a couple million dollars in silver city. Rat Race is legendary I enjoy so much of it, crazy how a lot goes wrong constantly and things still go right with so much charm. The music is so on point and matches well with the high octane energy. Also the reactions from everyone while things occur is spectacular! The ending kinda defeats the point of the rest of the film that'd be the only complaint I have.

23,Floated2,Over the top but entertaining,6,21 September 2019,"Rat Race stars an ensemble cast with a simple plot- about a group of people racing from one place to another to win a large sum of money. This is an adventure comedy and is quite entertaining with its over the top and slapstick humor. Although this film really isn't that funny, it's a light hearted comedy and had a good tone but the comedy doesn't deliver laughs.The ending was somewhat unexpected in a sense but not completely worth it. Decent older comedy but don't expect too much laughs.",Rat Race
24,Anonymous_Maxine,Just bad.,3,18 October 2001,"Rat Race is structured as a series of bad and tasteless jokes strung together by a flimsy clothesline of a plot dealing with a race of a bunch of random people trying to reach the same destination in order to obtain a huge stash of money that may or may not even really be there. Rat Race is disappointing from the very beginning, because it starts off by showing four or five of the exact scenes that we already saw in the preview and that have therefore lost all effectiveness. This is not a movie based on reality  there can really be no question that even the most eccentric of casino owners would never seriously consider picking a bunch of random gamblers out of their casinos and sending them off on this all-expenses-paid excursion to find a duffle bag containing two million dollars. Sure, these casino guys are all ridiculously rich, but Rat Race doesn't acknowledge the fact that rich people didn't get rich by giving money away. There is no financial return at all in the rat race portrayed here, or even any publicity!(spoilers  but does it really matter?) Rat Race is filled with actors who delivered goofy performances that are far below both their iconography and their reputations as actors. Cuba Gooding Jr. - after great performances in infinitely superior films like As Good As It Gets, Jerry Maguire, Outbreak, and A Few Good Men  performs several idiotic and humiliating skits throughout the course of this horribly disappointing movie. John Cleese manages to deliver some of the only funny lines in the entire film through his comical dentures, but still sinks far below his talent in this borefest. Other bad career choices were made by Seth Green, Amy Smart, and even the more negligible actors, such as Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, and Jon Lovitz. Seth Green, actually, is mostly in a bad role by association. His brother in the film is one of the dumbest characters I've ever seen in a movie, and his disgusting tongue piercing only serves to enhance his tremendous stupidity. I've had my tongue double-pierced since early 1997, have made little to no changes in my oral hygiene, and have never had an infection. If his tongue was that infected, it is entirely a result of his own idiocy (as we soon learn, with the realization that his piercing is self-inflicted), and therefore commands no sympathy or respect. If he wants sympathy, Major Payne can explain to him where to find it. Incidentally, the way he met a girl on the freeway (who shows up later at the Smash Mouth concert) was a shocking move to an even lower level.The movie goes wrong at the very beginning. It's clear that a mass travel to a single location is not the foundation of a good comedy, so they decided to throw in this ludicrous scene where Duane Cody (Seth Green) and his idiot brother get their jeep dragged up the sonar station at the airport in an attempt to ground all flights so that their opponents will not be able to fly to the location of the money (and if they had caught their flight in the first place, the movie would have been over in minutes and we would all have been spared). So at the expense of their remaining means of travel, they have successfully drowned out radio airwaves and grounded all flights. It's too bad the movie was released so soon, because if they had waited until after the September 11 terrorist attacks, the scene would almost certainly have been changed, and the movie could only have been better. This is one of the most moronic scenes in the entire movie, which makes you wonder why they didn't just have Cleese's character add in a stipulation that all transportation must be done on the ground. If the movie had been set for release after the catastrophic terrorist attacks, and they had decided to remove the scene, such a stipulation is almost certainly the thing that they would have decided on, both because it would be the fastest and cheapest replacement, but also because such a tragic event would surely make them realize how foolish the scene was to begin with.While Rat Race manages to avoid sinking to the abysmal level of other ludicrous comedies like the Scary Movies, it is clearly a mindless film that does not quite manage to redeem itself by having at least one or two things in it that can be taken seriously enough for it to be funny. The movie is bad enough even without the appearance of Smash Mouth at the end of the film, who are playing a concert for the poor. The way that all of the contestants in the movie stumble on stage with their newfound wealth at the end of the flim (I typed that accidentally just now, but it strikes me as a better word), ultimately deciding to donate it to the poor, is both insulting and disappointing. Sure, it would be a bad idea to make a movie that did nothing but promote greed, but all that time and effort by the characters as well as the audience is completely wasted (this is also one of the many things that ruined Titanic). It certainly is a good cause, but it is entirely uninteresting. You'd think that the virtually endless possibilities of the cinema would have inspired the film's writer (or writers, could there possibly have been more than one?) to come up with something more creative than this. In reality, donating to the poor, especially such a huge amount of money, is truly honorable and earns you a well-deserved interview and article in the newspaper. In the movies, it is a cheap way to get out of being accused of advertising greed, and winds up as little more than a boring end to a bad movie.",Rat Race
25,lisafordeay,HILARIOUS stuff,6,5 April 2014,"Rat Race is a screwball comedy about these people(Brecklin Meyer from Garfield,Seth Green,Whoppi Goldberg,Rowan Atkinson,Green's on screen friend and Goldberg's on screen daughter,Jon Lovitz,Katy Najamy,and Cuba Gooding JR) who have to go to Silver City New Mexico ,to receive 2 million dollars that's locked up in a locker. Of course since this is a comedy there is A lot of silliness going on including Cuba being lost in a desert as his taxi driver throw him out because Gooding Jr was a failed referee and he meets a bunch of Lucy impersonators,one of them was a transvestite,another where Goldberg and her on screen daughter met a squirrel lady and she sent them to a dead end,Green and his friend trying to stop the plane from leaving and Green's jeep getting tangled up in the signals,the list goes on and on. Rowan Atkinson was hilarious as an Italian who has a sleeping disorder and he always says Its a race I hope I win and he meets Wayne Knight who's a delivery man who carries a heart for a heart transplant patient that somehow gets lost,and even John Cleese is in this movie as the man who organized the race in the first place.Overall if you love a screwball comedy with plenty of laughs like Dumb & Dumber(Favourite comedy of all time) than check this out.",Rat Race

This is about several people in Vegas, racing to get 2 million dollars in a locker in New Mexico, set up by an eccentric millionaire (John Cleese). The movie has no real plot, it's just a bunch of amusing going on's on the way to Mexico. The movie has an ensemble cast of several ""funny"" people including Rowan Atknison (Mr. Bean), John Cleese (Monty Python), Dave Thomas(SCTV), Jon Lovitz (SNL), Wayne Knight (Seinfeld) and a dozen others.

However, like has happened on many other occasions, I was surprised by the humor in the film. While the principal characters were important in the movie, why didn't Wayne Knight get any billing? He's probably one of the best overweight actors since John Candy, and this guy can't get any work!? He was the only good reason to watch Seinfeld. Anyway, I felt this movie was quite a departure for some actors, and a great one for those who have made a movie such as this before. Jon Lovitz was excellent in this film, along with Mr. Bean (or Rowan Atkinson as he is called by non-Mr. Bean fans, who must be a sad group of people). The only downside to this film was the ending, which had yet another bad song by Smashmouth (and it was All-Star once again!). Overall, a good movie.",Rat Race

33,PredragReviews,Jon Lovitz steals the show!,7,9 May 2016,"The basic premise is simple - six keys, one locker, and a race for $2 million dollars. The plot has eccentric casino owner Donald Sinclair (a top form Cleese with some rather odd false teeth!), pull together 8 random people whom he gets to race from Las Vegas to New Mexico for a prize of $2,000,000 whilst he takes bets on the outcome. And what a group he has assembled. Mix into that some utterly hammy acting, Nazi Barbies, a cow tied to a hot-air balloon, and a woman intent on selling squirrels, and you've found yourself in the middle of Rat Race. And it's actually not bad. Rowan Atkinson's Italian, with an intentionally ridiculous accent and the line ""Oh, a race! ...I hope I win"" is frankly a remix of Mr Bean, whilst John Cleese's casino owner is classic Fawlty with extra teeth. But both those characters are classics, and stirred into this film, they become still funnier.Many of the talents used in 'Rat Race' include Whoopi Goldberg, John Cleese, Rowan Atkinson (re-using many aspects of his Mr. Bean persona), Cuba Gooding, Jr., Breckin Meyer, Seth Green, and a plethora of others. There are a few surprises, and the movie takes a lot of unexpected, very funny turns. This is a screwball comedy which simply wants to make you laugh for a couple of hours.

34,Sandcooler,Pretty tame,5,19 June 2009,"From a safe distance this actually looked like a hilarious fast-paced roller-coaster of a movie. Now that I've seen it while actually paying attention, I must say it's pretty disappointing. I can't even really remember one laugh, which is kind of a problem in a comedy. It's a weird thing though, I know it's actually pretty well-written. It's clever how all these plot lines intertwine, it's creative how everyone is held back from their goals by some unfortunate misunderstandings and whatnot. And I know those cow scenes are funny, but I just can't bring myself to be amused. The actors are also pretty annoying in this one, especially Rowan Atkinson, who plays some kind of Italian Mr.Bean rip-off. All his screen time in this movie is devoted to making some really creepy ""funny faces"". Then again, the same can be said about ""Mr.Bean's Holiday"". Even Whoopi Goldberg bothers me, I thought I'd never see the day. This thing isn't all bad though, the pacing is still pretty nice, there's hardly a boring moment. This wasn't really a chore to sit through, I actually wanted to know who would win the money. The outcome is really lame though. I'm not going to give it away, but just think of the absolute lamest possible outcome to this plot. The best I can say about this movie is that it's watchable.",Rat Race
35,philip_vanderveken,A nice comedy to lighten up a miserable day,7,2 August 2005,"I must say that I had some very high expectations when I saw the names of the actors that played a role in this comedy. With people like John Cleese and Rowan Atkinson, I hoped for the best, although I must also admit that I'm not a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, which still made me doubt about it. However, I didn't see it as a reason not to watch this movie and that's why I gave this ""Rat Race"" a try.When a group of billionaires is searching for something new to bet on, they find the perfect solution for their 'problem' in the new game that Las Vegas casino owner Donald P. Sinclair has invented. He has pulled a group of six strangers together and tells them that they will have to race to Silver City, New Mexico, where the first one to arrive will be able to retrieve $2 million hidden in a locker. The only rule is that there are no rules. Everything is allowed in order to get there first. At first they don't really believe this is a true race, but it doesn't take long before the narcoleptic Italian immigrant, the desperate father, the disgraced NFL referee, the decent lawyer, a team made up by a mother and daughter and another one made up by two weird brothers all embark on this weird adventure.What I liked most about this comedy was that it didn't rely on all those fart jokes and other toilet humor that you find too often in today's comedies. This is still a movie full of decent jokes and I must say that I had some very good laughs with it. However, that doesn't mean that this was a perfect movie. Take for instance Rowan Atkinson. I normally like all his parts, but this time I was quite disappointed by his performance. I'm not saying that I know someone better to play the role of Enrico Pollini, but this certainly wasn't Atkinson's finest. On the other hand I must say that John Cleese was very nice as the eccentric casino owner.Overall this isn't the best comedy ever, but I like to see it as one of those guilty pleasures, which can sometimes lighten up a miserable day. The story is completely over-the-top and absurd, but that's OK, because this is a comedy. The acting is pretty good most of the time and especially John Cleese and Cuba Gooding Jr. were a nice surprise. That's why I give this movie a rating between 6.5/10 and 7/10.",Rat Race
36,inspectors71,"A Few Moments of Inspired Lucy, er, Lunacy",4,30 May 2016,"The disappointing sort-of remake of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, Rat Race has lots of familiar faces, but little at which one could laugh at loudly. Except for two mooments (sorry)--the cow flying about, strung to the hot air balloon, made my wife and daughter wince at the cruelty, but I was in almost hysterics. Jon Lovitz, getting his upper lip splotched with some sort of jam, I think, and landing in a WWII memorial, forelock flapping, little Chaplin mustache in view, and delivering an undecipherable Hitlerian explanation to the GIs why he has just crashed their party was the bright spot in a very dark and dull comedy. The trouble with Rat Race is that just throws clichéd characters at you and says, ""Here, care about them!"" The laughs are forced, and except for a few moments of breakout badness, it's fairly vanilla.In Stanley Kramer's It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, human avarice was on display, and a lot of the humor was also forced, but the grandness of scale just made you to laugh, to care about the characters, to want to know what the ""Big Dubya"" was.Here, it's so hurried and soulless that I began to squirm very quickly. When Dave Thomas tells a high-priced hooker what he'd like, I was laughing, but I was relieved when the punchline got pulled and we were able to move on.Oh, well. Some of the reviewers of this film didn't like the charity ending, and I'll have to admit, I thought it destroyed the cynical nature of the plot, but watching John Cleese, as the billionaire who puts forth the contest to a group of average shrubs to win some serious cash if they can get to a bus locker in Creaking Armpit, New Mexico, was good for a laugh.One.Of three.Not a good average for 112 minutes of movie comedy.",Rat Race

I really laughed alot throughout this movie.  It was going for a roll. Until it was obvious that no one was gonna get the movie and they ended the movie on one of the worst notes I've ever seen.  It's like they built this movie to be as funny as possible without ever thinking on how to end the darn thing.  Good solid comedies should end decent.  Not this moralistic crap they shoved at us.  Not that a moral movie would be bad, it's just that it has no place in this movie.  It contradicts the characters.  I doubt I'll watch this more than 2-3 more times, if that.The movie trailer though, did it's job.  It got me to see it.  But for god's sake, why destroy a movie with a horrible ending.There was some problematic plot holes as well.The dvd I thought was excellent.  Especially the Call The Actors section.

38,baumer,Not your average comedy,6,21 August 2001,"I'll tell you first that I did not really like this film.  I thought the humour got very old very fast and there wasn't enough good humour in it to satisfy those expecting something similar to Zucker's other efforts.  But having said that, let me say this.  Rat Race does one thing tremendously well and that is it never stops trying.  I don't think I have seen a film where almost every scene has the potential to be funny.  Many and most comedies just take their linear route and go from point A to point B and try to put in some humourous situations along the way.  Well Rat Race is ubiquitous in it's attempt to humour us.  Every scene is ripe with potential and I would only guess that if this is your type of comedy, then you will enjoy this film.  There is everything from Jon Lovitz inadvertently looking and sounding like Hitler just as he ends up on stage in a WWII veterans ceremony.  We also have Rowan Atkinson and Wayne Knight chasing after a heart after it has fallen out of a window.  You have fathers that make their little girls put their bums out the window and ""go"" while the car is still moving because of greed.  You have Whoopi Goldberg and her daughter acting like mentally handicapped people after they get off of the fastest car in the world and you have Cuba Gooding Jr. driving a bus full of winy Lucille Ball look alikes.  There is also Seth Green and his brother chasing after a cow and a hot air balloon as it almost takes out a bus.  Now if this is something that sounds appealing to you, then I guess you should rush to see this film.  There is enough humour in here to satisfy everyone and this is coming from a guy that didn't even like it that much.  If you happen to dislike this kind of comedy, then avoid like the plague. 
I found Rat Race to be unfunny but I can't really tell you why.  The jokes were fast and frenzied and most of the audience, including my wife, was laughing quite hysterically but I just didn't see the humour.  But as I said, if what is described above sounds funny, then you will probably appreciate the film in some or all regards.Rat Race is about a bunch of people that have to get to a bag that contains two million dollars in it.  A casino owner gets all of best betting customers together to wager on the contestants along the way.  While the race is on, we cut back every once in a while to the bettors to see what silly practices they are betting on next.  In one of the funnier scenes, Dave Thomas tells a call girl that he wants to get naked with her in a pool of Pepto Bismol and have her wear a cowboy hat and lick her feet while she shaves his butt.  She looks at him in a queer manner and then finally replies that she will do it for $3000.00  From behind the curtains all the bettors appear and they begin handing over money to the man that bet closest to $3000.00.  These guys are shameless and will bet on anything.Rat Race is a review that I am actually having trouble finishing.  I know I disliked this film immensely yet when I think about it, I know that it is zany and quite off the wall and that scores points in my books.  Maybe I was in a bad mood that day, maybe I just didn't get the humour or maybe it is really as bad as I say it is.  Whatever.  See it for yourself and be the judge.6.5 out of 10",Rat Race

40,Beta_Gallinger,"An inferior partial remake of ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" with some very funny parts and a bit of lameness",6,3 September 2009,"I saw this 2001 comedy a couple of times in late 2006 or early 2007, being familiar with a number of the cast members (John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Seth Green, Rowan Atkinson, Wayne Knight, and Dave Thomas). The first time, I thought it was pretty lame to begin with but eventually got better. It improved with a second viewing. After that, I learned that it was loosely a remake of ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", a 1963 comedy which I had never heard of before. After finally watching that film last month, I watched ""Rat Race"" again last night. This time, I was not quite as impressed as I was before, and like probably many other viewers, I think its predecessor is superior. I still laughed quite a few times during my third viewing, mind you.Donald P. Sinclair is a billionaire hotel casino owner in Las Vegas who has a whole group of billionaire associates, looking for something to bet on. Six gold coins are placed in different slot machines, and the gamblers who find them are brought together and told by Sinclair about $2 million hidden in a locker in Silver City, New Mexico! They are sent on a race from Vegas to Silver City, and whoever makes it to the locker first wins the money! Odds of winning are 1 in 6. Participants in this race are the Cody brothers (Duane and Blaine), Owen Templeton, Enrico Pollini, the Pear family, Vera Baker and her daughter, Merrill Jennings (whom she put up for adoption as a baby), and Nick Schaffer and his new girlfriend, Tracy Faucet. Mayhem ensues as each of these parties finds themselves on a different adventure, in bizarre situations! Meanwhile, Sinclair and his associates keep track of the racers and make their bets! During my third viewing, it looked fairly promising around the beginning, with Nick Schaffer (Breckin Meyer) being billed for porn films he claims he didn't watch. This part made me laugh, but a lot of other scenes around the beginning disappointed me. The film's introduction to Vera Baker and Merrill Jennings is rather tedious and not that funny, and perhaps it takes a little too long for the race to begin. Even after it does, there are some lame jokes, most notably Kimberly Pear (the Pear daughter, played by Jillian Marie) in the car, talking about how she has to go ""number 2."" Blaine Cody's (Vince Vieluf) speech impediment caused by his recent tongue piercing isn't the worst comedy idea I know of, but definitely not the best. However, there are also a number of very funny parts, with some of the situations Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz) gets into with his family, how Owen Templeton gets a bus driver to give him his clothes, the ""Deep Voiced Lucy"", Enrico Pollini's (Rowan Atkinson) adventure with medical services driver Zack Mallozzi (Wayne Knight) and the human heart, etc. Because of gags like this, I can say that despite the dull moments, at least I laughed, which is more than I can say about SOME comedies I've seen in recent years.The plot of ""Rat Race"" is the same basic idea as that of ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", with a bunch of people letting their greed get the best of them, on a mayhem-filled race, with different people in different sorts of trouble, all for a hidden fortune! Also, like the film that inspired it, this movie features an ensemble cast. Of course, it is LOOSELY a remake of the 1963 comedy, so there are some differences, such as what starts the race, a different set of characters, different (but equally bizarre) situations the characters find themselves in, and in this film, it's not the police who are keeping track of the racers. The humour isn't quite the same, either. The kind of sexual and toilet humour featured in this film was obviously unheard of in 1963 Hollywood. The only unfortunate difference between the two films is that this one isn't as funny. However, if you like slapstick and silliness, and also like or at least don't mind some crude humour (this is not a family movie), you may or may not like this film, or you could find it to be a mixed blessing, like I did during my last viewing.",Rat Race
41,jhclues,"It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad-- Rat Race?",8,7 February 2002,"If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you're probably thinking it looks hilarious and you've made a mental note that it's one you don't want to miss.  More often than not, however, the funniest stuff is in the previews, and when you see the whole movie it's a let-down.  But I'm here to tell you, that is decidedly NOT the case with `Rat Race,' directed by Jerry Zucker, and furthermore, make a mental note:  This movie is hilarious, and one you DO NOT want to miss.  In the tradition of Stanley Kramer's 1963 BIG comedy hit, `It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,' this one is exactly what it is supposed to be-- Fun (yes, with a capital `F'), and Funny-- with one laugh after another that just keep on a-comin'.Las Vegas casino owner Donald Sinclair (John Cleese), likes to offer his elite customers-- the `high rollers'-- something they can't get anywhere else, in the form of things they can gamble on that are so bizarre you can only imagine.  And the big one he comes up with this time begins with the planting of six lucky tokens in his slot machines.  Those who win the tokens are invited to attend a meeting, at which time Sinclair announces that they are to be the lucky participants in a `race' of sorts.  In a train station locker in the small town of Silver City, New Mexico, there is $2,000,000 waiting for whomever gets to it first.  He passes out six identical keys to the token bearers that will open the locker, shouts `Go!' and they're off! And Sinclair's high rollers proceed to put down some big bucks on their favorite horse-- uh, dog!-- uh-- Well, you get the idea...The participants include Nick (Breckin Meyer), who is pretty much just a regular guy; NFL referee Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.), hated by millions because of a recent botched call; brothers Duane and Blaine Cody (Seth Green, Vince Vieluf), not the brightest bulbs to begin with, and hampered in their communications by Blaine's newly pierced tongue; a mother, Vera (Whoopi Goldberg), and the daughter she gave up for adoption and with whom she has just reunited, Merrill (Lanei Chapman); Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz), who has a hard time making his wife, Bev (Kathy Najimy), and their two kids, Kimberly (Jillian Marie) and Jason (Brody Smith) understand why he's interrupted their Vegas vacation to drag them off suddenly to New Mexico; and-- last but not least-- Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson), a narcoleptic Italian.  It's quite the eclectic bunch, and they definitely put on quite a show.During the rush for the gold, they encounter a number of people and situations that drive the laugh meter through the roof, including:  A woman (Kathy Bates) selling squirrels by the roadside (Vera and Merrill); a group of `Lucy' impersonators on their way to some kind of Lucy convention (Owen); a `Barbie' museum that isn't what it seems, and not a great place for the Jewish Pear family to visit; an errant cow, a hot air balloon and a guy who overhears too much (Duane and Blaine); a jealous helicopter pilot named Tracy (Amy Smart), who buzzes her boyfriend's house at a most inopportune time (Nick); an ambulance driver, Zack (Wayne Knight), who is transporting a human heart for a transplant, and suffers something akin to the same fate as that famous `cat' due to his curiosity (Enrico).  Zucker and writer Andy Breckman pulled out all the stops with this one, and the result (and there's much, much, MUCH more than what's mentioned here) is some pretty wild stuff.The secret to making this all work, is above all to keep it moving-- and Zucker certainly does that.  He relies heavily on sight gags and slapstick, and knows how to set up the schtick for a real payoff, which he succeeds at time and again throughout the entire film.  it's all fairly controlled insanity, and with a couple of exceptions when Zucker wanders into Jim Carrey/Farrelly Brothers territory, it's pretty easy to swallow.  Most importantly, IT'S FUNNY! with enough different kinds of humor thrown in to satisfy just about any taste.  And that's a rare thing to be said of any comedy, and it's a big part of why this one's such a gem.The cast is superb, but the highlights have to be Cuba Gooding Jr., who demonstrates a real knack for comedy; John Cleese, who can make you laugh just by smiling, brandishing as he does a spectacular set of teeth; and Rowan Atkinson, who does some masterful bits of physical comedy, the likes of which rivals the best of Peter Sellers and Buster Keaton.  The way he mugs and moves is absolutely hysterical.The supporting cast includes Gloria Allred (Herself), Dave Thomas (Mr. Grisham), Dean Cain (Shawn), Paul Rodriguez (Gus), Brandy Ledford (Vicky), Tristin Leffler (Pierced Girl) and Andrew Kavovit.  One that lives up to it's expectations and more, `Rat Race' is everything you want it to be, a laugh a minute movie that never lets up, and one that won't wear your brain out making you think about it too much.  This is pure entertainment that'll lead you down the road to riot (make that `laugh' riot).  There hasn't been anything quite like this since Jimmy Durante kicked that bucket and started that other bunch of madcaps off looking for `The big 'dub-a-yeh'.'  Zucker and his gang really pulled this one off, and moreover, they did it with style.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.",Rat Race

I watch current comedies, but rarely laugh because it's stupid.The original from 1963 (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World) is an absolute classic among the comedies: The actors are a little bit stupid, but in a very funny way: very high quality of comedy!Although this film is well staffed with famous actors, but in the implementation, there is a strong lack of wit and quality, which is included in the original.",Rat Race

All the actors are great, but I have to pick out Seth Green, Jon Lovitz, Kathy Bates and Amy Smart for being the funniest. Watching it, I could parallel all the chacters in the movie to the older one: Atkinson to Winters, Knight to Silvers, Lovitz to Berle, Green to Rooney, Cain to Shawn and so on. The scenes with the hooker, millionaires and the Lucy impersonators are among my favorites along with the cow whose life is threatened to the extent she suddenly realizes she can talk ! The one thing I didn't like was the ending; it was sort of anti-climactic to me and didn't hold up to the rest of the movie. Smash Mouth was great ! But I would have expected something a little more unexpected although the final zinger to Cleese was a nice touch. I only hope there is a sequel !",Rat Race
44,rebeljenn,what you see is what you get,4,18 March 2006,"'Rat Race' practically sells itself because of the number of big celebrity stars in the film. Normally films that use several big stars are not that good, and 'Rat Race' is no exception there. The film is about a group of people who are brought together to race around for money, locating different clues to lead them to the treasure. This race brings together all sorts of characters. Sure, some of the film is funny, but it's a film that once you have seen it, that is enough and the humor is quickly forgotten. Pretty much, what you see is what you get with this film. You will laugh in some places, and you will get into the action, but do not expect anything more than that.",Rat Race
45,Movie-12,Very funny and entertaining. You're bound to have a good time. *** (out of four),7,18 September 2001,"RAT RACE / (2001) *** (out of four	""Rat Race"" revives a genre Hollywood has neglected since the sixties: the big event, ensemble chase comedy. Who better to breathe life into the subject than Jerry Zucker, the mastermind behind the ""Naked Gun"" films, and ""Airplane,"" two of the most hilarious movies I have seen. After years of directing straight dramas, Zucker says he is thrilled to be back doing comedy. ""It's very visual and there are lots of big visual stunts,"" Zucker explains in the film's production notes, ""kind of a James Bond comedy in a way because there are so many sight gags.""	Good comparison-""Race Race"" is indeed a visual comedy. Its laugh-a-minute attitude works for the creative situations.  The audience does not necessarily laugh at every single joke the movie throws, but the humor is timed well. ""Rat Race"" also contains a terrific cast and provides enough laughs to be worthy of at least one viewing.   	John Cleese stars as the eccentric Las Vegas casino tycoon named Donald Sinclair. He wants to keep his wealthy, high stakes gamblers interested in his gambling techniques so he arranges a new, quasi-legal sporting event for them to bet on: a human rat race.Sinclair randomly places six golden coins in several different slot machines. The customer service sends the winners to a large banquet room where the characters learn of a two million dollar jackpot resting in a duffel bag, inside a locker, within the city of Silver City, New Mexico-seven hundred miles away. The fist one there keeps all of the money, tax-free. ""the odds of winning are one and six"" explains Sinclair. ""There's only one rule: there are no rules!"" 	 The players include a vast variety of different characters. There is Vera Baker (Whoopi Goldberg), who, after giving her child up for adoption as a baby, has decided to meet her daughter, Merrill (Lanai Chapman). Owen Temleton (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an NFL coach who recently blew an important game, has come to the sin city to forget his horrendous mistake. Mr. Pollini (Rowan Akinson from ""Bean"") is an exuberantly cheerful, but narcoleptic, Italian fellow. Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz), and his family is vacationing when he slips off to play slots and wins the chance of a lifetime. The Cody brothers (Seth Green and Vince Vieluf), are first to cause trouble in any crowd. Finally, Nick (Breckin Meyer) a skeptical young lawyer-in-training, meets a charming young woman (Amy Smart), and encounters plenty of adventures with her.  ""Rat Race"" offers plenty of hit and miss humor. Much of it misses, but much of it hits the mark as well. The majority of the humor is physical and exaggerated. Very little offers sharp, witty satire on any part of culture. The film says something about greed in a zany sort of way, but for the most part this is just a two hour laugh riot, nothing more, nothing less.
However, this is a tricky script to write, and for the overall result to provide this much effective comic material, Andrew Breckman's ingenious script is indeed successful. It's not easy writing a comedy like this, and Breckman does indeed run into a few problems in the overcrowded plot. Even more difficult is creating a conclusion for a story like this. No matter how you end it, you are certain to displease at least some audience members. Breckman has found a way to have his cake and eat it too. I would never dream of revealing how this race concludes itself, but I will say it is not exceedingly satisfying, but sure does work over the obvious other possibilities. ""Rat Race"" is one of the funniest movies of the year. It's energetic, irrelevant, and entertaining. You are sure to have a decent time.",Rat Race

Some of the jokes are a little stupid, but nothing in the league of the anti-intellectual ""Dumb and Dumber"". There's a bit of an edge, so the film doesn't fall 100% in the sappy family comedy genre and should entice those who normally enjoy battles of witty put-downs in their comedies. The film is ""zany"" and if you prefer comedy / romance or well-plotted comedies with deep characters, see ""L.A. Story"" instead, or ""When Harry Met Sally"".If you like this, I suggest similar films ""Midnight Madness (1980)"", and ""Scavenger Hunt (1979)"" both of which are aging a little now but good for a rainy day, or as kid / family films.Who should see this film:-- Everyone who likes a zany comedy, although there arebetter films out there if you're not a regular movie-goer.I'll give ""Rat Race"" a 7 out of 10.",Rat Race

Although this doesn't reach the same heights of 'Airplane' and 'The Naked Gun', it sure does have a good try and ends up a fantastic comedy film to enjoy.

51,jhaggardjr,Joyfully silly comedy,7,7 October 2001,"""Rat Race"" is a comedy obviously inspired by the classic 1963 Stanley Kramer directed all-star farce ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"". Jerry Zucker, the co-creator of explosively funny comedies ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"", directs. ""Rat Race"" is pretty much a hit-and-miss affair. It isn't nearly as funny as Zucker's two earlier hit comedies (it also isn't as funny as another comedy Zucker co-directed, ""Ruthless People""), but the film does have its share of laughs. ""Rat Race"" doesn't have as big of an all-star cast as ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" did, but it does have a big cast nevertheless, and most of them come off funny. Whoopi Goldberg, John Cleese, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jon Lovitz, Kathy Najimy, Seth Green, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart, and (in a hysterical cameo) Kathy Bates are all fun to watch and seem to be having a good time. The only character that I didn't like was that Italian guy played by British comic Rowan Atkinson. This was one of the most unfunny characters that I've ever seen in movie history.

I never thought I would ever say this: I laughed, I cried, I peed myself and I thoroughly enjoyed ""Rat Race"". Its real genius is not in the premise itself, although that one was good enough for that other famous film. It is in the details, the acting and enthusiasm of every single participant. Vince Vieluf is a stand-out as this century's definitive lovable idiot and at least on a par with Rowan Atkinson. John Cleese shines in his interpretation of - of all things - an American. Jon Lovitz' family is actually believable as victims of circumstance and go above and beyond the call of duty (pardon the pun) to get a laugh. Cuba Gooding Jr. is at his most athletic, which is saying a lot. But a special Oscar should have been offered to Whoopi Goldberg for attempting a part that is absolutely against type: a sentimental, polite, retiring, naïve, soft-spoken and even-tempered soul to whom terrible things happen without ever affecting her sunny disposition.

65,fjhuerta-2,A very intelligent comedy.,4,19 November 2001,"Yesterday I watched this movie. And I kept thinking to myself, ""How come comedies aren't this intelligent anymore""?Case in point: modern comedies rely on slapstick and independent events to create laughter, ala ""Rush Hour 2"". This comedy, on the other hand, plays like a 1 hour Monty Python sketch: there are tons of recurring events throughout the film, or events that set a chain reaction of other events that lead to even further mayhem.The cast is over the top. Rowan Atkinson & John Cleese are two of the most dignified and funny men ever to grace the screen. Their charm and charisma is tremendous. The rest of the cast (Jon Lovitz, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr.) are hysterical, too. They manage to get into so many funny situations it's hard to keep count. Think a modern ""Airplane!"". This is it.The movie drags a bit at first, playing like a bad comic flick. But it picks up steam by the 10th minute, and by the 15th, when John Cleese appears, it is a laugh riot.Also, let us not forget this seems to be an homage to the Canonball Run movies by Hal Needham. Both start in Las Vegas. Both have top notch acting. Both end up being ""road trip"" movies. This one (SPOILER!) shares a similar ""ending"" (not quite, though) with the first Canonball.But this one is a hell of a lot funnier. I'll never look at a cow the same way now. Terrific.",Rat Race
66,Aidan McGuinness,No classic but great fun,7,21 January 2002,"The plot of ""Rat Race"" is simple enough - six groups of people are racing to one town to receive a prize of $2,000,000 as part of a bizarre show put on by the eccentric Donald Sinclair (John Cleese) for his wealthy friends (who are betting on who will win the money). The cleverness in this is it allows us to switch between six stories (5 sets of contestants and the gamblers) so that if you don't like one of them you're sure not to be stuck with them for too long before switching.""Rat Race"" is good. ""Rat Race"" is funny often - if not all the time. Rowan Atkinson's character ""Enrico Pollini"" is particularly weak and tends just to act like a gaping moron in a most humourless fashion. Nick Shaffer (Breckin Meyer) is the plays-by-the-rules guy gone bad and is, as such, a bit dull though he's nicely balanced by the psychotic helicopter-flying Tracy Faucet (Amy Smart). Particularly good though are the Cody brothers - they get the best of the ""slapstick"" humour elements and add a bit of tomfoolery to the proceedings. However it's Randy Pear (Jon Lovitz) driving his family (literally) mad in his pursuit to win the prize that steals the show - watch out for the hilarious WWII veterans rally (the film's funniest moment).There's nothing special about the directing or the acting - there doesn't need to be. This film relies on a script and thankfully the script is able to keep up with the task. Sure there are plenty of weak moments (the ""I Love Lucy"" segment stank, as did most of Atkinson's role) but that's helped out by the fact we're constantly moving to the next gag - the film is not slow paced. Admittedly I guessed the type of ending (if not the exact nature) but that didn't spoil my enjoyment. By no means a classic comedy but great fun nonetheless - certainly a worthy way to spend a couple of hours at the cinema.",Rat Race

He was pointless, characterless, n the time should have been given to the other hilarious characters instead!

68,RhapsodyReviews,Fun Comedy.,7,10 November 2019,"Review:
'Rat Race' is a comedy film directed by Jerry Zucker. It is based on Stanley Kramer's 1963 classic 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'.
I keep for getting about this movie and when I happen to see it on TV, I'm pleasantly surprised. It's one of the best ensembles in a comedy to come out of the 21st Century so far.
Eccentric tycoon Donald Sinclair - played by John Cleese - devises a game to entertain the high rollers who visit his Las Vegas casino. He arranges for six competitors to race the 563 miles to Silver City, New Mexico, where the winner's prize of $2 million has been placed in a luggage locker. Unbeknownst to them, Sinclair's wealthy patrons place bets on who will win it all.
Everybody in this movie was born to play the roles they were given. If I had to pick a standout it would have to be a tie between Seth Green and Vince Vieluf. They play brother and the way they can play off each other and make the comedy grow in scenes in fantastic. They are hands down the funniest duo in the film.
Is it perfect movie? No, or course it's not, it's a fun dumbed down comedy that wants you to have a good time and it succeeds in its mission. If the you don't think the movie is self aware in the fact that it is a ridiculous concept, wait till the ending and you will realise.
Overall, anybody can have fun in this movie if you can turn your brain off and see the movie for what it is.
3.5/5",Rat Race

Unfortunately, that idea alone is one of the only positive elements of this film. The implausibility, immaturity and poor acting make this 2-hour film feel like it's 4 hours. While it starts out with incredible potential, the rest of the film sadly trudges across the finish line.",Rat Race

'is that IT?'. i'm SURE there was a funny moment or two in it. or maybe it's just really not my type of humor... or maybe i liked it better when i saw similar slapstick sort of situations done by, let's say, the marx brothers... maybe i'm just getting old... or maybe i just don't go for things i'm supPOSED to go for just b/c all the ingredients are present... that still doesn't guarantee a good meal...",Rat Race
71,richspenc,Freakin hilarious,9,4 May 2017,"This movie is great. The funniness and style of humor is more similar to older style quirky comedies that has become less common in recent years. Since this side of the turn of 2000, unfortunately toilet humor became the more popular choice of film. ""Rat race"" knew how to be fabulous without being dirty. For anyone who has seen my list of movies reviews on my movie review page will see the large amount of old films on my list. As I just explained, you know why. From the start at the Las Vegas hotel when ten different people get a specially placed coin from the slot machines having them to meet together in a lounge where the zany humor begins. The terrific selection of actors definitely has helped this film too to being great. Our old 1960s era British veterans favorites John Cleese (""Faulty towers"", ""Monty Python"", and ""A fish called Wanda"", all hilarious) and Rowan Atkinson (""Mr. Bean""), Whoopie Goldberg (in her best performance since ""Ghost"" and ""Clara's heart""), John Lovitz, Amy Smart as very pretty blonde, Seth Green (who's funny as Scotty in the ""Austin Powers"" movies), and Brekin Meyer (who somehow got charged for watching 11 hours of porn in his hotel room). Each one of these people are sent on a wild goose chase to Silver city, NM to retrieve 2 million dollars out of a bus station locker. The hilarity begins immediately and then seldom lets up. For those of you who don't like having aching sides from laughing too much, don't watch this movie. Even funny is John Cleese's very first joking comment about a huge asteroid about to plummet down and wipe out all civilization except for those selected people who will stay in a secured steel underground vault, and it would be up to them to reproduce and bring civilization back (that joke also playing reference to a couple Twilightzone episodes with that theme).Then the chase begins. Here are some of my favorite jokes. Cleese's funny comment just before everyone takes off on the race, ""the race has technically been going for 45 seconds now, and so far that man standing over there is winning since he's the one standing nearest to the door"". Mr. Bean falling asleep standing up, then hitching a ride with a guy delivering a heart transplant, and that situation ending up with the heart in a dog's mouth and the transplant driver considering Mr. Bean (who's revealed to have no family) as an immediate replacement heart donor. Seth Green and his buddy who can't talk clearly cause of a tongue piercing (who at one point meets a girl with similar peircing amongst other piercings too) end up with their pickup being dragged up the side of the airport control tower at the end of a rope. The same guys who later on manages to attract a cow on a hot air balloon. Whoopi Goldberg and her sister ordering mimosas (much to the waitreses' delight) and then during the race in a rocket car scene that gets them so disoriented that they end up in an asylum bus just in time for (wow!) macaroni night. The rocket car speeding by a service station while breaking the sound barrier right after the service station manager sarcastically says ""dear Lord, if you don't like the way I conduct my business, send me a sign"". The same service station guy right before the ""dear Lord"" sarcasm arguing with Brekin Meyer and Amy Smart about unfair prices and the service station guy saying they're out of sand and Amy saying ""What do you mean there's no sand? We're in the desert!"". Amy also happened to be a helicopter pilot, has a very funny reaction when she catches her boyfriend from overhead in her chopper cheating on her in his backyard wadding pool. Another very funny part involved Kathy Bates as a squirrel saleslady and an outcome of what shall happen to those who refuse to buy a squirrel. Then the Cuba Gooding jr. and the busload of I love Lucy impersonators (one being a drag queen) and Cuba impersonating a bus driver. Where else would we see again 50 Lucille Balls simultaneously go ""helloooo""? One of the very funniest scenes of all was the John Lovitz Hitler scene. He crashes into a WW2 veterans reunion with very coincidental details between accidentally having gotten a car lighter stuck in his mouth, getting black paint the size of a short mustache on him just above his lips, and having borrowed Hitler's car from a Nazi museum. With all that, John unintentionally looks, talks, and gestures just like Hitler to the WW2 veterans. Classic. That one I liked. Also a very funny scene with Lovitz involving a female motorcycle gang right before the Hitler part. Funny enough, as Lovitz has the funniest scene, he also has my least favorite scene with talk about his kids having to go to the bathroom, the term 'prarie dogging' being said, and then what to do about it while on the road. The great scenes though were much much more in quantity than the not so great. This film overall is great and very funny.",Rat Race
72,Hang_All_Drunkdrivers,Very funny movie marred by a weak ending,9,28 December 2005,"A rich obnoxious loudmouth English idiot played very funnily by john cleese tells 6 or so people where they can get $2 million In Silver City NM if they get there first - and the race is off. Extremely whacked out scenes one right after the other follow. Imagine Cuba Gooding who has just hijacked a bus full of Lucille Ball impersonators and is racing to the loot when he crashes into a cow hanging from a hot air balloon.!!! Jon Lovitz is hilarious as the typical boob American with his fat wife and his two fat smartmouth kids who among other adventures end up visiting a very strange Barbie museum.As for the ending - i won't say what happened but to this point the movie has been very funny in showing how stupid and greedy Americans are. But then they try to tack on an uplifting ending that to me really falls flat. Still a great show. Butcept for the ending, i'd have given this a 10.Incidentally, i would not call this a remake of ""It's a mad mad mad mad world"" made back in 1965. It's more a redoing of a similar theme. Both movies are super.",Rat Race
73,ab-2,This movie was so funny,10,21 August 2001,"Rat Race is just too much of a funny movie. The movie is about eleven people who are picked to do a race for $2 million. The movie has a big star cast like Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Seth Green, Jon Lovitz, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Kathy Najimy. There are also some big name stars that make a special appearance in this film like Kathy Bates, Dean Cain, and Brandy Ledford. Rat Race kept me laughing throughout and it's not one of those movies that have any stupid jokes that no one laughs at or no one gets (ex. Scary Movie 2.)

I didn't laugh much and this says it all for me. A comedy should make me laugh and laugh hugely in order to like it much.There were ups in the movie but not too many. The characters were not that funny to start with. After seeing ""What About Bob?"", ""Airplane"", Peter Sellers', Dudley Moore's, Jerry Lewis', Lesslie Nelson's and Chevy Chase', it's really hard to accept this average of any movie.Liked Cuba Gooding Jr. though.

78,ajdagreat,"hey again, it's me",10,30 August 2001,"I know I already commented on this movie twice, but I'd again like to add something else. First of all, I noticed someone had commented on my note about the puns. I'd like to apologize if anyone took offense at my review. I wasn't trying to be mean, I was just getting tired of all the ""Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" puns. Sorry for being a bit hostile to some other reviewers.Second, I noticed some other things and I'd like to make a point. At least one person said that this movie didn't have as much of a what-will-they-do-for-that-money feel as in ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"", but it's more about the characters getting into wacky situations. A few people said they didn't like the ending, and at least one said that it was out of place for a movie about how ruthless people can be when there is lots of money involved.I think these two comments answer each other. I think some people are forgetting, while this is partially a remake of IaMMMMW, this is not IaMMMMW. Perhaps ""Rat Race"" is less about people's greed. Perhaps ""Rat Race"" centralizes more on satirizing what people will endure for so much money, not what acts people will commit for so much money. Or perhaps ""Rat Race"" is not really about anything, but it's just a summer movie looking to earn some dough. Whatever. Made me laugh either way.",Rat Race

80,ajdagreat,"""Two if you count Lindberg""",10,23 August 2001,"The Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team has made some of my favorite movies. I adore ""Airplane!"", ""Top Secret!"", ""Ruthless People"", and ""The Naked Gun."" So when I heard that Jerry Zucker was making a new comedy AND that it starred such funny actors as Jon Lovitz, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, Seth Green, John Cleese, and Wayne Knight, I was convinced that it would be absolutely hilarious and become the funniest film of the year.And I was not disappointed. OK, so ""Shrek"" is more likely seen as the funniest film of the year by critics, but in terms of my own personal enjoyment, ""Rat Race"" is it.Jon Lovitz and family were great; the whole Nazi bit was absolutely inspired. Whoopi Goldberg and Lanei Chapman were fabulous, the squirrel bit was one of the funniest scenes of the movie. Amy Smart and Brecken Meyer - well, there had to be a little romance in this movie; not bad performances by either. Seth Green and Vince Vieluf were hilarious. Every word out of Rowan Atkinson's mouth made me laugh (""It's a race, it's a race! I'm winning, I'm winning!""). Cuba Gooding, Jr. was also very funny. John Cleese and the other gamblers proved to be another great subplot (the scene with the hooker is my favorite scene of the movie).Some people commented on the ending. Yes, it seemed a bit out of place judging by the whole do-anything-to-get-the-money theme of the movie, but I guess everyone has a soft spot. That goes for the writer of ""Rat Race"" and all the characters. A must-see!",Rat Race

The actors, for the most part, are a funny crew (especially Cuba Gooding, Jr., and the talented Wayne Knight, who for some reason doesn't get billing), and the script is very inventive, coming up with all sorts of wild scenarios. It's only when they try to go for ""dark"" humor that it falls flat (the cow abuse is embarrassingly unfunny). And the peppy, sunshiny, goody-goody, ""we've sure learned our lesson"" ending is so different from the PERFECT cynicism of the original, it's almost sad. But for the most part, it's a fun movie that is pretty much guaranteed to make you laugh. 7/10 stars.",Rat Race
83,FeverDog,"If this is ""family entertainment,"" I'm never having kids. *SPOILERS*",4,7 September 2002,"The commercials for RAT RACE made it look too juvenile for me to enjoy, but since my boyfriend adores this movie (and the soundtrack), I finally relented and watched it with him tonight.  I make him watch David Lynch films and all sorts of obscure indie stuff (I recently forced URBANIA on him), so I felt I owed him an innocuous Hollywood product.I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I saved my bitching for y'alls. Yeah, RAT RACE has its moments, but a great deal of it irritated me. Let's start at the beginning.  RAT RACE was marketed as a ""family film,"" so I was a little surprised to discover that the first scene centered around a porno movie.  (I can hear it now:  ""Mommy, what does AFRO WHORES mean?"")  This scene has no purpose in this movie other than to cram some naughtiness into a PG-13 movie.And while we're still on the segments in the casino, it's pretty convenient that all the characters happened to play, within the same time frame, the slots that held the gold coins.  What would have happened if they didn't? Would those millionaire gamblers just sit around and wait?  And how did they get those gold coins in the slots in the first place?But I'm belaboring a plot point that's necessary for the movie to exist, so I'll press on.  About Whoopi and her long-lost daughter: they're meeting for the very first time, yet throughout their whole ordeal they don't discuss with each other anything about themselves.  Why make their relationship such a presumably complicated one?  Couldn't they have just been, say, a mother and daughter on vacation together?  Why the business concerning a long-ago adoption?  And why portray the daughter as a hard driving career woman chained to her cell phone who never again needs contact with her business? Did the screenplay just forget about this subplot and character trait?
This illustrates the main weakness of this movie - the characters are inconsistent and interchangeable;  it's exhausting when everyone is equally zany and with no identifying traits.  And another thing - the events aren't plausible.  Oh, sure, the characters can do some quirky things, but the characters themselves have to be believable.  Take THE NAKED GUN (another Jerry Zucker movie) for example.  Frank Drebin has some pretty exaggerated moments, but everything he does is, in theory, possible in his world. (Jane is also funny, but it's a different kind of funny, which makes all the difference.)  A character in RAT RACE defying natural laws by leaping onto a speeding train destroys any plausibility the movie may have; these clearly aren't real people, so why should I care about them?Another problem I have with RAT RACE is a moral one.  The characters obtain their modes of transport almost totally by theft.  I know, I know, this is just a silly comedy, and the same actions didn't bother me fifteen years ago when I saw MILLION DOLLAR MYSTERY, but there's a lot of lawbreaking in RAT RACE, and it bothers me now.  And I won't delve into the whole airport-sabotage sequence other than to wonder if the screenwriters didn't consider the real-life implications of such an action; was that scene funny before 9/11?I'll skip over the distasteful bits concerning the heart, the drugging of one's family and the Nazis (whose buildup and payoff worked better in an episode of ""Seinfeld""), and move on to complain about the acting.  Rowan Atkinson started out annoying and ended insufferable; I don't know when I liked a comical character less.  And the three Oscar winners need new agents.  Whoopi came off best, but she didn't have much to work with (loved the copper perm and purple lipstick though); Kathy Bates' part was shrill but mercifully brief; Cuba, was...oh, man.  Cuba, babe, please fire your agent!  Following INSTINCT and CHILL FACTOR, this is your third strike (be glad I haven't seen PEARL HARBOR or SNOW DOGS) - it's time to give your '97 Best Supporting Actor Oscar back to its rightful owner (Edward Norton, for PRIMAL FEAR).  An actor of your stature has no business running half-naked through the desert and being checked out by a transvestite Lucille Ball impersonator.  Do you even read the scripts to your movies anymore, or are you reaching into a bag and pulling your next project out at random?There's other small points that bother me (how did Grisham and the hooker get to the loot so fast?), but, basically, RAT RACE amounts to little more than your basic batch of character types being hindered by arbitrary obstacles on their way to a rather underwhelming and inexplicable ending. They give the money to charity?  What kind of ending is that?!?  Yeah, it's the ""noble"" thing to do. Never mind the probability of cross-promotion/licensing whores Smash Mouth (do they ever say no to selling out?) putting on a benefit concert in the middle of the New Mexico desert, but who would honestly do such a thing?  Yes, they say it's the journey, not the destination, that makes a trip worthwhile, but there's no journey without a destination.  If there was ever an example of a ""wrong happy ending,"" this would be it.  What a bummer end to a movie that, despite my nitpicking here, I did enjoy parts of (I confess to enjoying the bit with the cow and some of the Lucy stuff along with the character with the tongue piercing - at first I thought his indecipherable speech would run me up a wall, but he grew to be my favorite).But as far as my boyfriend knows, I found RAT RACE quite funny and charming.",Rat Race

88,mlevans,I'm a Zucker for a good comedy!,9,16 February 2002,"Contains Spoilers One cannot say `They don't make films like THAT anymore,' after viewing `Rat Race.'In a 2001 version of the classic `It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World' and other 1960s chase/race comedies, Jerry Zucker strikes gold and recaptures the same madcap, zany feel of Mad World, The Great Race and other classics of that era.Just like its predecessor, Rat Race pits several individuals, drawn together by chance, into a frenzied cross-country race to recover $2 million in a dufflebag, locked in a locker in the Silver Springs, NM train depot. Instead of the dying words of Jimmy Durante guiding them to `the big W,' the group is sent on the chase by billionaire casino mogul Donald Sinclair (John Cleese), who (unbeknownst to them) is tracking their every move, while a bevy of high-rollers is betting on the winner.The cast is first-rate, with Cleese bringing his English polish and well-honed comedic skills to the production. As the movie continues, the wealthy patrons bet on everything from which flavor chocolate the lawyer will bite into in a box of candy, which maid can dangle from a curtain longest, which of the group will throw up first when Sinclair's private Leer pilot zigzags during a flight, etc.The assembled group of contestants is disparate enough. Jon Levitz is Randy Pear, a man who has finally agreed to take his family on vacation  although it appears his real purpose in going to Las Vegas was not to see David Copperfield, as promised, but to hit the casino. The pudgy Pears (Levitz, Kathy Najimy Brody Smith and Jillian Marie) make a cute family and even look somewhat alike. When  Levitz decides to accept the invitation, he tells his family he has received a `once in a lifetime' job opportunity to sell fountain pen ink in Silver City  and off they go.Whoopee Goldberg and Lanei Chapman play a mother and daughter, who have just been reunited after more than 25 years. They seem to have little in common at first, but suddenly have two million things that interest both!Seth Green and Vince Vieluf play Duane and Blaine Cody, a pair of dysfuntional brothers, out to make a quick buck. Duane (Green) is definitely `the brains' of this Two Stooge outfit. When Blaine (Vaieluf), who can barely be understood, thanks to a self-performed tongue-piercing, complains that he could break his neck faking a fall at the casino, Duane bravely replies `That's a risk I'm willing to take.'Upright young lawyer Nick Shaffer (Breckin Meyer), a clean-cut attorney with political ambitions, winds up flying with gorgeous helicopter pilot Tracy Faucet (Amy Smart), on the pretext of visiting his sister at the Silver Springs Hospital.Two individuals, meanwhile, are competing solo. NFL official Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding, jr.) is a national scapegoat (especially in the South and in Vegas) after blowing a call that cost the Dallas Cowboys a game the previous weekend. Enrico Fellini (Rowan Atkinson of `Mr. Bean' fame) is the final contestant, bringing all his usual facial quirks and bizarre movements into play.The result is as much mayhem as one can imagine, with all the contestants, naturally arriving (more or less in one piece) in Silver City at basically the same time. In between, though, Zucker maintains the pace beautifully and what could easily become a tedious string of crashes and near-crashes is instead, enjoyable throughout.Everyone has a plan and  naturally  everyone's plan goes seriously awry. Nick sees his attractive copter pilot turn psycho when she discovers her boyfriend in a pool with another woman and destroys the copter and half of a suburb in her rage. Smart is stunningly attractive as Tracy and never more so than when she cackles sadistically as she chases her terrified boyfriend.Owen has one problem after another, first being stripped and dumped in the desert by an irate cab-driving Cowboys fan who lost thousands of dollars due to his officiating blunder. When he finally staggers into a service station, he cons a bus driver out of his uniform, only to discover that he is driving a busload of Lucille Ball wannabes to the Third Annual I Love Lucy Convention!Other than the copter, no one is flying, thanks to the Cody brothers and their bungled attempt to destroy the airport radar system. When the brothers decide to have duplicate key made and split up to increase their chances, the hardware store clerk overhears them and makes off with the key. He winds up dangling from a balloon  along with a cow, all the way to Silver City.The mother-daughter combo have their problems, as well. Asking `the squirrel lady' (a delightful cameo by Kathy Bates) for directions without buying a squirrel can be fatal. It isn't for Vera and Merill, though, and neither is accidentally setting a land speed record in a rocket car.While Enrico, a narcoleptic, is falling asleep in the middle of airport terminals, the Pear family is having their own share of misadventures. When Randy finally gives into family pressure and stops so little Kimberly can visit the Barbie Museum, they discover to their horror at it is actually the Klaus Barbie Museum, dedicated to France's most hated WWII war criminal, and lovingly run by young skinheads. After finding their van sabotaged, they calmly swipe Hitler's Mercedes-Benz and get into even more hilarity.Zucker, working for one of the few times without his older brother David, brings home another winner, with the help of original Saturday Night Live writer Andrew Breckman. This is a good, relatively clean film and lots of fun. This probably the best comedy I've seen in several years.",Rat Race
89,matlock-6,"Entertaining, but disappointing",3,5 July 2003,"Rat Race is an average film at best, and unfortunately is a victim of it's own construction. Essentially a re-make of a 1963 film called ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", it suffers from too little character development, and far too many stupid scenes that aren't very funny.The huge cast of stars, one of the film's biggest attractions, is also it's greatest liability. So many good comedic actors appear that the movie jumps around far too much to give any one of them nearly enough time to really satisfy the audience. Just when you're beginning to enjoy Rowan Atkinson's goofy ""Enrico Pollini"" character interacting with Wayne Knight, the shot jumps elsewhere. It felt too much like 5 or 6 movies that they jammed together into 1.Some of the silly comedy is a bit too silly (read: stupid) to be believable as well. Why would Jon Lovitz's character say ""That's a nice dike"" (meaning to say ""bike"") to a tough looking female on a Harley? I didn't laugh, I just thought ""moron"".It was just way too over-the-top and out of control.

There is only one vital ingredient missing from these various sketches: comedy.In fact, towards the end of the film, I actually became convinced that this was an inside joke. That is, Whoopi, Cuba, Cleese, all these big names, got together and said ""hey - let's make a film touted as a comedy that really isn't funny and has the most intellectually devoid storyline in the history of movie making. But we'll throw in an all star cast and see how much money it makes - just for a good laugh."" If that was the case, I salute you - for you have achieved your goal. But if this was a genuine attempt at comedy, I fart in your general direction. On the comedy side of things, this film sets low standards and fails to achieve them.At the end of the film, the cast ends up realising that there is more to life than just money, such as humanity. I rolled my eyes so hard that they nearly did a 360. As soon as the credits started rolling, I exerted the full force of my 300 pound weight on the DVD, shattering it into tiny pieces. I then vacuumed it up, sparing my rubbish bin the displeaure of it's company. Congratulations to the film makers - this is as bad as it gets. You've hit the bottom and it can't get any worse than this. A comedy so stupid that it even chimps wouldn't give it a star.",Rat Race
91,hippiedj,"""YOU...SHOULD...HAVE...BOUGHT...A...SQUIRREL!""",8,5 February 2002,"*Contains a few minor spoilers*It's been a long, long time since there was a madcap celebrity filled chase film that actually was worth sitting through, and Rat Race succeeds on most levels, breathing some new life into this type of comedy genre.Whether or not you want to compare it to It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, I liked the sprinkling of cameo roles here and there and the fact that the film just keeps moving.  Plenty of creativity no matter how absurd it gets and the sheer zany atmosphere will keep you smiling whether the jokes hit or miss.First and foremost, Kathy Bates as the squirrel lady STEALS THE WHOLE MOVIE! It was brilliant and sinister all at once.  John Lovitz really carries the film and is such a natural (I still think he deserves huge praise for Mom And Dad Save The World).  Not only is the Barbie Museum scene excrutiatingly funny (watch his eyes move around!) but his confrontation with the World War II vets will definitely be considered one of comedy's funniest moments in film.  Would have made Mel Brooks proud! While Hollywood seems to be trying to focus so much on ""established"" tired comics like Eddie Murphy, it's really guys like Lovitz that have a true knack for comedy.  He's underappreciated and made a great team with Kathy Najimy for this film (what he makes the poor daughter do so to avoid a rest stop is so nuts it brings back quite a few memories of family vacations I was subjected too!). Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s funnier moments were really when he would try to dodge being recognized as ""that bonehead,"" and Whoopie Goldberg is funny because it almost seems as if her character from Ghost were transplanted into this film.  Seth Green is surprisingly likeable though his character stops at nothing to get ahead in the race.
Besides the squirrel bit, other small things really shine more than some of the more played out segments.  For instance, the rental car trainee had me really laughing as well as the gentle nature of the skinhead tour guides. These worked better than even the flying cow or the busload of Lucys. You'll really get a giggle out of the baby on the train, his lack of reaction to Rowan Atkinson made Rowan's role in the film more worthwhile. Gloria Allred yelling out a building ""I SAW THAT! I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN!"" when witnessing Wayne Knight running into Rowan Atkinson was a great moment.While not 100% funny, Rat Race offers just enough zest to keep you entertained.  Some of the strangest chases I've ever seen, and that helicopter on a rampage is a WOW.  It's also nice to see faces like Rance Howard, Dean Cain, Colleen Camp, Wayne Knight, and Dave Thomas too.  All this adds up to quite a lot of fun until the Smash Mouth concert....I don't mind a happy ending, but this could have been worked out just a little better.  It just seems when you put a band that's popular ""at the moment"" in a concert scene, especially at the end, the film crashes. Ah well, at least Rat Race offers plenty more to enjoy, and is perfect for a good old silly time.One thing's for sure, I can't get that choir version of the song Rat Race out of my head and I think I'm going to have to go get the soundtrack now!",Rat Race

One part with Jon Lovitz and a bunch of WWII vets made me laugh so hard I had to drink some water to control myself.

The insanity that ensues ends up being tedious instead of humorous and the film just doesn't know how to end... at a rock concert with some fly-by-night band-of-the-moment eating up screen time?! This isn't funny, this is numbing. Ah, welcome to Hollywood.However, there ARE a few moments of hilarity, but those moments are, unfortunately, very few. Jon Lovitz' Hitler is at the very top of that very small list. What the film does tend to specialize in are extremely - and painfully - UNfunny moments, most of which tend to center around Vince Vieluf, who plays brother to the ever-charming Seth Green, and Rowan Atkinson, which lends one to think how the comedic genius behind BLACKADDER and MR. BEAN could play a role that was anything but funny.If given the choice between watching this again and serving jury duty, wasting time at the courthouse seems to be awfully tempting...",Rat Race

The film has a good pace, with enough twists and turns to keep your interest. Reminded me a bit of our ""Carry On"" films. The Barbie joke was perhaps the best. The betting scenes were always amusing. I thought Cuba Gooding was out of place, the scene where he persuades the driver to lend him his clothes was silly.

It is also the same for the characters.Most of the characters are well portrayed(especially Jon Lovitz and the 2 brothers), some are nothing but a one time joke which were stretched to a long film(Whoopi Goldberg) and the character of Rowan Atkinson is nothing more than Mister Bean with an Italian accent.Nevertheless it is quite hilarious. If you look for a sophisticate funny film, look somewhere else. Jerry Zucker is not known for sophistication. He does what he do and he does it well. Which means that this is a movie with a lot of vulgar jokes which makes you lough.

A referee who is wanted by millions due to a bogus coin flip at a football game, a mother who hasn't seen her daughter in over ten years, two con artist brothers, a smart and wise gentleman who has had his movie bill gone through the roof from a bachelor party, an Italian tourist who is just happy to be alive, and a husband who is willing to lie to his wife and kids to gamble. They all receive one gold coin while gambling and find out from the hotels owner, Mr. Donald Sinclair that this coin puts them in a race from Las Vegas to Silver City, New Mexico to open a locker that consist of Two Million Dollars. By that said let the race begin! Rat Race is a modern version of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. From where the journey starts, Rat Race is a wild treat that brings lots of laughs as you watch six groups of desperate people go across the country for greed facing cops, crazy squirrel ladies, rocket cars, wild taxi drivers, a tour bus filled with I Love Lucy girls, a pasture of cows, a medic who wants to look at the organs he transporting, Nazi's, and more! Director Jerry Zucker has given us a well made film that is smart and classy.

How refreshing is this film when compared to the worn out 'romantic comedy' predictable recipes! There are no leads, no sugarcoating, and no bland themes, but it's a small study on the greed lurking even in the nicest people. Young actors and film-makers should study this gem, first of all for facial expressions, comedic timing, and editing.

To see John Cleese with Teeth that Mat Dillon used to wear was funny. The ongoing betting scenes were very funny. The characters covered the spectrum. Oscar winners and new kids in the movie business all worked well together.  Too many funny scenes to count.  Amy Smart is such a fox. She was good in ROAD TRIP and even better in this.Cuba Gooding is such a versatile Actor- No Oscar here but he played his heart out and is not afraid to try anything.

It is one WILD and CRAZY movie!!   It never slows down.  Most of it is really, really funny; and best of all, NO Fart Jokes.  There are a couple of really dumb, unfunny scenes in it (What was with the cow?  I mean, does anyone think that's funny?) but it's mostly real humor.. especially the action being interspersed with Captain Incisor (John Cleese) and his cronies betting on all kinds of funny stuff!  Ordinarily I don't like silly movies like this, but I really found myself drawn into this one, and I couldn't wait to see more and find out who would win the race.  Some low points include the very beginning (which is slow) and some vulgarity and over-the-top scenes, but the general feel of this movie is mad fun, and these days I appreciate any movie that can be really humorous and not involve farting.   I found the last part to be very heartwarming but *please*, can we STOP with the Smashmouth concerts at the end of movies? I'm sure he's a nice guy and everything but what are 'Shrek' and 'Rat Race' going to look like in a few years?  Probably like Flavor of the Month that people are long-since bored with.

107,Denver53,Sounds Funnier Than It Is,6,22 March 2002,"If you were to listen to someone describe the list of characters in ""Rat Race,"" you might think the movie screams with laughter. It doesn't.While some concepts are initially promising (a dumb guy who has trouble speaking because his tongue is pierced, an NFL referee who is hated by many after blowing a coin toss, a Jewish family man who hates Nazis so much he still won't buy a VW), the execution is dull. None of these characters really does anything especially funny. They are just quirky. And you spend a lot of time wondering at the set-ups, like why does this Jewish guy associate the VW with Nazis of 50 years ago? What exactly did the ref do that determined the outcome of a game if it was only a coin toss (wouldn't a blown call in the end zone make more sense?)? Why does this pierced tongue guy have trouble speaking when so many others with pierced tongues don't?Other characters are simply one-joke wonders (the actor who used to play Mr. Bean is a mugging narcoleptic) or just inexplicable (a career woman is traveling with her more laid back mom [Whoopi Goldberg]). The concept of a ""Lucy Impersonator Convention"" is worth a laugh the first time you see all the Lucy's, but repeated material that shows all the Lucy's crying like Lucy did when things went wrong gets old, fast.In the end, only the usually frenetic pace keeps Rat Race from becoming a bore. John Cleese and his group of unnamed gamblers who wager on almost anything is a funny bit. And if you like scatological humor, the concept of ""prairie dogging,"" which I had never before heard in this context, is a guaranteed laugh-out-loud moment.We gave Rat Race a 6, because it tried hard and because of Cleese.",Rat Race

Everyone else in the cast helped to make this one a must-see . A couple of scenes were strangely reminiscent of ""MAD WORLD""-at one point, it seemed the movie would end much the same way.

110,EdYerkeRobins,Really Funny Stuff,8,22 March 2002,"Jerry Zucker is responsible (as writer, producer, or director) for some of the funniest movies of all time  from the lewd, crude, and rude ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", to ""Airplane"", to the TV series ""Police Squad"" and its film spin-off ""Naked Gun"".  ""Naked Gun""'s sequels began a comedic downfall, which continued for a decade, until 2001's ""Rat Race"".	""Rat Race"" is, quite simply, hilarious.  Like any Zucker film, its presentation is rapid-fire joke after joke, in totally unrealistic situations tied together by a plot thin enough to let them go off into absurdity but with just enough substance to be able to bring them back together at the end (and what a positive-vibed ending! I'd call it implausible but in this film that's a moot point.  It really does make one's day though).  ""Rat Race"" definitely has this down, as long as one checks their brain at the proverbial door.  Not every joke works, and most are surprisingly clean (but risky clean  particularly a gag involving accidental Hitler impersonation at a WWII veteran's celebration), but the fact is most work, and this has one of the best laugh-to-joke ratios in a long time.  It even bests what I have seen of Zucker's earlier work (everything except ""Kentucky Fried Movie"").	Though I personally thought the film was hilarious, it is easy to see the other side of the issue.  The reason these situations are so funny are because they come totally unexpected and totally absurd; knowing what happens I doubt I would laugh at it all again.  Some of the situations, upon close inspection, reveal themselves as annoying (Lucy's, I'm looking at you, though I realize they were intended to be annoying) or too stupid to work more than once (what's up with the squirrel lady?).  There never seems to be enough of the most enjoyable characters  the brothers Seth Green and Vince Vieluf, and ""Mr. Bean"".  Though these are valid points, they are the same points that can be made about any Zucker film.  For what it is, there are no major flaws with ""Rat Race"", but if you don't like what it is, then you simply will not enjoy ""Rat Race"".	It's difficult for me to review comedies because they're either funny or they're not.  If they're funny bravo, if not they're a failure.  Though I never tested to see how well it holds up through multiple viewings, ""Rat Race"", thankfully, is funny for at least one viewing, and quite possibly more.",Rat Race

112,thehardyboyz2043,This is the best that Hollywood could do?,1,21 August 2001,"(A possible spoiler or two) That's what I kept asking myself, while I was watching this pathetic excuse for a comedy. This was the best that a talented cast of actors could do?, well if that's true then I find that very sad indeed. There's way too much going on for the movie to really have much of a point, but here's a summary. Seven people are given the chance to win $2 million, all they have to do is go to Silver City, New Mexico, and open a locker at the local station. This 'game' of sorts is organized by a wealthy casino owner (John Cleese) who hopes that this new game of his will provide him and his business partners with plenty of money (you see while these seven are trying to get to the money, a lot of rich people are betting on who will get there first). This is one of the few interesting parts of the film, everything else just isn't funny, Cuba Gooding Jr. seems to suffer the worst as he gets humiliated in scene after scene, the few that he's actually in that is. Jon Lovitz also looks like he's just collecting a paycheck, as does Whoopi Goldberg. Rowan Atkinson (""Mr. Bean"") is about the only funny part of the film but even he can't provide a lot of on screen laughs, mostly just groans.  The movie's main problem is it tries to cram too much into 2 hours, all of the actors barely get any screen time, which didn't make me really care what happened to any of them.

124,IridescentTranquility,A slow start but lots of visual humour,8,29 January 2006,"I only saw this film by accident and I'd never even heard of it until ten minutes before it was shown on television, but I felt that it was worth watching, overall.It did occur to me that perhaps the story was a little bit slow in getting going, but I put this down to the number of individual characters that had to be introduced at the start. Having said that, once the idea behind the race was set up, I felt that the film did start to pick up the pace within the first half-hour or so. There was much energy generated by the rush to start the race. I think a lot can be communicated with visual comedy. John Cleese's self-confessed eccentric personality went perfectly with the manic grin he wore at the start of the film. Equally, Rowan Atkinson's facial expressions are just right for generating visual humour, and he is also physically very funny - watching him dance at the end of the film was priceless and the crowd his character Enrico gathers when (being narcoleptic) he falls asleep standing up in the middle of a hotel was brilliant. Sometimes I think that you could give Rowan Atkinson a ball of string and he'd still be funny, and his accent in Rat Race also suits his his appearance very well.There were many instances - ""Where the hell's the airport?"" and the airline pilots' heads crashing into each other - that made me recognise that here was the work of one of the directors of the Naked Gun films. The ""You should have bought a squirrel"" sequence is another of these moments - it's that sort of comedy. The fight where two characters squirt each other with milk straight from the cow reminded me so much of the fight in Naked Gun 2 1/2 with the electric toothbrush and the hairdryer. It also struck me that many of the extras in the film - the girl who destroys her cheating boyfriend's house from the vantage point of a helicopter, the squirrel lady and perhaps even some of those participating in the I Love Lucy convention - are really quite mad. There are also a fair few unexpected twists in the story - the Barbie museum scene and even the end of the film were two bits I certainly didn't see coming. On a more musical note, I have never heard so much classical music in a comedy film of this type, but I have to add that I always thought Grieg's In The Hall Of The Mountain King was a perfect piece of music for any scene where you need to make a character look stealthy. An excerpt from La Traviata also gets a look in.",Rat Race

The plot is copied from It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World which I think is one of the comedy classics - take a group of unrelated people, point them to some treasure at the end of the rainbow, stand back and watch human nature take over. In other words, cheating, scheming, falling over each other trying to get there first. I like John Cleese, Cuba Gooding, Whoppi Goldberg...and was smitten with Amy Smart - just don't get her angry with you ;-)In the Special Features section all the actors were saying that it was a true joy on the set even with 14 hour days - lots of laughing and good times - and it shows in the performances.",Rat Race

The cast is well chosen and helps the film.  John Cleese is very good and has some of the best comedy lines in the film.

Since MAD WORLD is one of my favorite movies, I was eager to see this updated version. It succeeds extremely well. Some plot points have been modified to make the film more believable.

It's certainly not something I'd want to spend money to see  at the movies.Some of the scenes, such as the fate of those who don't buy squirrels and the scene with the cow and the balloon, are funny. Some of them are not, and because there are so many characters and we skip from one to another it is hard to remember or care much what is going on to each one of them. John Cleese is probably the best of a cast full of comedy stars who have done much better work. I'd say that it was better than average, but unfortunately the ending is lame - wincingly sentimental.

With such talent, and Jerry Zucker directing, I had high hopes for this film.Unfortunately, such a constellation of talent seems to have produced a traffic jam rather than great art, and rather than building upon each other's talents, the many comedians in this picture seem to have found their collective lowest common denominator. I cannot say that this film is altogether terrible, but it is probably the most ""over the top"" live action film I have ever seen, and 'looney tunes' cartoons would seem to be a considerable influence. At the same time, the film itself seems to take itself seriously, and rather than a Zucker comedy, one has a campy throwback.This film might be hilarious to the right person, or possibly pre-teens, but I could not recommend this film to most modern film-goers.",Rat Race

The movies are very similiar, with rat race stealing a thing or two from the original.  I would even go so far as to call rat race a remake, rather than an independent film.

John Cleese is a genius, Rowan Atkinson is hilarious, I'm a huge John Lovitz fan, the cast was absolutely flawless, and it even has Newman in it! The whole beginning of the film is rather amusing. Overall it was pretty damn funny, especially John Lovitz's accidental entrance into a WWII vet convention as Hitler. I'd have given this movie at least a 7 if it weren't for the most dreadful ending in years, if not in decades.Okay, here it is. Everyone is running for the money, and everyone in the race literally has their hands on it, until....*gasp* they stumble into a charity concert! Guess who's playing...? SMASHMOUTH! Oh my gosh, I didn't know that this movie was sponsored by Nickelodeon! They want to share the money amongst themselves, but then they find out that they really should give it to the poor children who need it. Fair enough, if it can send a message, great, but don't you think they could have pulled it off a LITTLE better? Okay, so they give the money away. To end the movie, they tell everyone that John Cleese's character will match the money they donate...oooh....karma! And to top it all off, the competitors all sing ""All-Star"" with Smashmouth. I couldn't think of a worse group and/or song to end the movie with. Truly this is a sign of the Apocalypse.In short, you'll probably be better off watching this movie up until the very end.

The only people who won't laugh seeing this film are those who think ""comedy"" is something Woody Allen does in his darkest moments. Those people never laugh with their bellies; at most, in their funniest moments, they smile with their mouths but not with their eyes.They complain that ""Rat Race"" is stupid, but, if one is a rocket scientist smart enough to understand the math behind quantum mechanics, one realizes that being funny is about being stupid. A joke is, by definition, an unexpected solution a stupid person found for an insoluble problem. Slapstick *is* funny, if done right. And they did it right here, everyone is always at danger of suffering considerable bodily harm, because of their stupid decisions. If the characters were smart enough to make the right decisions, it would be drama, not comedy. The characters' morals aren't the best, most of the transportation they use, ranging from a hot-air balloon to a supersonic rocket-car, is stolen. And most of them are trying to cause some harm most of the time, from a very botched attempt to sabotage an airport radar, to a helicopter pilot who tries to teach her boyfriend a lesson about fidelity, to the quite successful revenge of a frustrated squirrel salesperson. Even if it weren't for their questionable actions, normal parents wouldn't like their children to meet most of those characters in real life: there are gamblers, neo-nazis, lesbian bikers, a football referee, a tranvestite Lucille Ball impersonator, and even attorneys. But, with very few ""bad"" words, just three jokes about sex and a couple others about toilets, this is about as ""clean"" as a film will be these days.

Neither are you going to change my mind on this one either, even though most of you people thought it was a riot too. SPOILERS! But I'm going to try change your mind on the ending. Many of you hated the ending.

The location they're at is in Las Vegas. Of course at the end of the movie they're in Silver City. I already mentioned the ending, but there is a plot hole that I caught.

Isn't unrealistic that a big charity concert like the one that was held be in a town as small as Silver City, New Mexico?But my favorite characters were the brothers, played by Seth Green and the other guy (forgot his name).

The one scene which coaxed a spontaneous laugh from me was the arrival of Lovitz and family at the WW II veterans convention. Maybe what was missing was the edge of the original Airplane or the the first two Naked Gun flicks. I agree with those who found the ending of this film sticky and sentimental in the extreme. But my main objection is the attempt to substitute constant movement for comic inspiration. It's pretty sad when you can't even make such reliable comic performers as Cleese and Wayne Knight funny. Every time I saw Cleese I kept thinking that he must have a great dentist as those teeth were so white! I think this film needed a much better script and a more subversive attitude.

The classic 1963 ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" was due to be updated, and in my opinion, this is a fair update. One of the things that made MMMM World work was its huge assemblage of popular talent and comics, even small cameos. Here, you have a small group and very few added characters to the chase. In the original, lots of gags that hit every time; here, you have hits and misses, almost as many misses as you have hits. The Nazi Barbie Museum and the ""heart"" being the two biggest misses. Another big miss was when the two brothers ended up in the big wheel rally, and realized a big wheel truck was about to pound on them, they scattered out the car door, which took more time to do than simply put the car in gear and drive away from where they parked. The ""mumble-mouthed brother"" could have been in reference to Buddy Hacket's vocal style in the original movie, but if so, I think it's insulting.But with all its faults, RAT RACE is still a funny movie -- a one-timer for me -- with my favorite scene being the helicopter girl flies over her boyfriend's house. I haven't laughed so hard since ""Airplane!"" My favorite line was when after John Cleese told them ""Go!"" and everyone's still seated, he says, ""All of you have been racing for 45 seconds, and this guy is in the lead because he's the closest to the door.""

162,brown1982,Funnier Than Expected!,10,18 August 2001,"I didn't know what to expect, but I think this is gonna be in theatres for awhile.  It's got tons of laughs; a real crowd-pleaser! Lots of gags, slapstick and exaggerated characters.  It was a lot of fun. Sort of in the same vein as the Naked Gun schtick, but I enjoyed this a lot more. There are more goofy characters.  John Lovitz is hilarious as a family man!  It was great to see Rowan Atkinson again, as funny as ever, and John Cleese and his betting cronies are a hoot to watch as they bet on anything and everything. I heard one reviewer say it was ""overkill"", but I disagree.  The laughs keep coming and coming.  What's wrong with that?!!",Rat Race
163,maartenvankrimpen,Great comedians!!!,10,18 June 2002,"This movie is more than hilarious! You have to like this kind of humor, but for the people who like it it is a must-see. You can see all brilliant comedians, old and young, like Whoopi Goldberg en Lanai Chapman, Breckin Meyer en Amy Smart, Seth Green and Vince Vieluf, Kathy Najimy and Jon Lovitz, John Cleese, and of course Rowan Atkinson as a weird Italian with a sleepsickness (sorry, my English is not quite perfect yet, I'm 13 years old you see). John Cleese plays the famous casino-owner Donald Sinclair, who organise a race for six different people. In Silver City, New Mexico is a locker with two million dollars in it. The one who gets there first, wins the money. You have Enrico Pollini, a weird Italian guy, there is Vera Baker with here lost daughter, Jewish Randy Pear with his family, loyar Breckin Meyer with helicopterpilot Amy Smart, and two brothers, Seth Green and Vince Vieluf. The situations which a rises are brilliant, made by scriptwriter Andy Breckman and director Jerry Zucker. Not all stories are nice, Rowan Atkinson's story is even quite boring, but the great acting, hilarious comedy, en outrageous script makes this movie till a must-see for people who like screwball-comedy's as ""the Cannonbal Run"".",Rat Race

I haven't laughed this much while watching a comedy in a very long time. Most people will knock this movie because they say it's too over the top or the laughs don't last but I'm here to call ""BULLCRAP"" on that criticism.Classic direction, a brilliant script, and one of the best comedic ensemble cast ever assembled come together to create quite possibly one of the funniest movies ever made.Also be on the lookout for two of the greatest credit sequences ever put to film (you will be cracking up before the actual wild and crazy ride begins).",Rat Race

Living in Las Vegas, Rat Race was all the rage and EVERYONE couldn't wait to see this ""Las Vegas"" movie. It was so miserable, acting was terrible, editing was obvious - probably done by students, and the story was SO done before that I not only wanted my money back but I was willing to PAY somebody to get me out of the theater. Awful movie old jokes from Canonball Run...and I'm now convinced that Whoopi Goldberg in a GIANT RED FLAG for a bad script. DONT BELIEVE THE TEENIE BOPPER VOTE....

When the DVD finished, we went back and watched some of the best outtakes the world has ever seen. I have no idea how the crew could have completed work on many of these scenes without a change of underwear. Timing, delivery, story line...this surprising comedy had it all. Watch it.

Plenty of reasons to avoid this movie. It didn't start out well and got worse as it progressed. I managed about 40 minutes and then I'd had enough and switched off. Hollywood just can't do decent movies any more. They're either lame, like this one, or they are extremely violent. Spoilers: The reference to concentration camps was in very bad taste and I doubt whether because of it the movie would ever be shown in Germany. And about 30 minutes in there was a little girl with her backside hanging out of a moving car window doing Number Twos because her father refused to stop the car. Who on earth writes this rubbish?",Rat Race

I know CGI was low in 2001 and opting for poppets seems like the good choice and it probably is, but if u let go of crappy CGY and get crappy poppets that is not smart at all, but then again maybe the budget was low. 5/10Even tough it is a 2001 comedy movie it made me laugh on some occasions and I enjoy it in 2021 (20 years later)

As I was walking out of the theatre I was laughing so hard I couldn't breath.  I had to stop several times because my sides hurt so much. I was still laughing five blocks away, and for the past two days I have been randomly bursting out in peals of laughter.  This is one funny movie. It is stupid, predictable, has only two or three jokes and plays them over and over again, but the same can be said of most great comedies.  This one is in the ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" genre, and although this cast isn't as great as that one was (what cast is?), they hold up well.  If you don't laugh at this film you have no sense of humor. Rowan Atkinson and John Lovitz are absolutely brilliant. See this film!",Rat Race
175,BlockChuckster,Call the Doctor,8,21 July 2003,"While watching this ensemble piece, one thought came to my mind...I'm going to have a coronary from laughing so hard.  I'd put this movie off primarily due to the premise...cross country chase movies are like the little branch of parsley on your plate at Denny's...nice to look at every now in then, but something we all usually brush to the side to get to what we're really interested in.  This was different though...it was brilliant writing and wonderful timing on everyone's part...especially kudo's to Jon Lovitz who had me snorting ice tea out of my nose...and I hadn't had any ice tea for three weeks prior to watching this movie.  WWII veterans, vacationing families, Neo-Nazi's, Smash Mouth Fans, red heads, female pilots and gamblers will all love the tongue in cheek approach this movie took in sparing no one from the sights of their humorous antics.  All in all, it is most definitely worth watching, and for certain a must in any dvd/video collection.",Rat Race

I'm just glad I didn't pay to go see it - I hate leaving the cinema half way.... Well the aforementioned did their best to salvage it, Seth Green in particular tried to find something in the lines to turn into a character but there's nothing there. The gags are telegraphed so far in advance you can tell what they are before the opening credits. And the production is poor, equipment in shot, poor sound effects... This was clearly a film with a limited budget, and most of that was spent on getting some famous names on the poster. And presumably they hung on to the rest of the budget to spend on advertising...I'm off to watch some paint dry now. I'll be way more entertaining.",Rat Race

178,mse1576,I Want These Two Hours of My Life BAck,1,28 August 2001,"I saw Rat Race on the recommendation of my brother. He thought it was hilarious, but I thought it sucked.It is a series of vignettes filled with boring, silly, humorless pranks. They never went anywhere, they just seemed to be funny in themselves; they never really come together. This is odd, because the premise of the movie is based upon the characters coming together.Was Jon Lovitz's character supposed to be Jewish? If so, why is it then funny that he was driving Hitler's car? Jewish people and Hitler. AAHHH! Indeed a comic delight!Rowan Atkinson should not EVER do an Italian accent. What makes him funny is not his accents but his face as well as his gags. He accentuates neither in this film. Furthermore, when he tries to find the keys inside the child's seat, he hints at a sick form of child abuse. Child abuse is NEVER funny, nor will it ever be.The only chuckles (and I do mean chuckles, never all out laughs) are when the billionairs take bets on everything, including how long maids could hang from drapersies.Jerry Zucker is better than this. See Airplane! or better yet, Duck Soup by the MArx Brothers.",Rat Race

Pleasantly suprised,10,11 August 2001,"I personally did not think that rat race would be much going into the movie, and my suspicion seemed confirmed by the first part of the movie. The movie starts rather dull and the jokes don't fly to well...was I in for a surprise! As soon as the ""race"" begins this movie becomes non-stop laughter for the whole 2 hours.The subplots are not only hilarious but are easy to keep track of despite having 6 ""teams"". (*****Possible spoiler*****) One of the sub-plots, involving the Pear family accidentally going to a Nazi museum and driving off with Hitler's car - only to end up crashing into a World War II veteran reunion, is absolutely hilarious and is the best scene I have ever seen in a movie so far (*****End spoiler*****). I was also not expecting much from the rather ho-hum casting and I thought it would be disaster when I saw Whoopi Goldberg. The entire cast, even Whoopi, was top notch and flowed seamlessly into the comedy.The comedy in this movie also took laughter to a new level: in the theatre I went to the entire audience burst out into laughter at most of the jokes. Some of you may think this silly comedy (which it is) is ridiculous or ""Cable Guy - Jim Carrey"" type. As silly as this movie is you won't find yourself saying ""this isn't funny, there's no way that could ever happen"", even in the stuff which is beyond fantasy you won't stop laughing. Even the ending, which seems kind of lame at first will have you clapping for by the end of the movie with an appearance by Smashmouth.Overall this movie get's 5 out of 5, two thumbs up, %100 or whatever you want to call it. I could easily see this movie getting multiple ""Comedy of the Year"" Awards",Rat Race

We all cannot stop laughing even if we watch the movie over and over again. Awesome cast - John Clesse, Jon Lovitz, Seth Green, Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean), Wayne Knight (Seinfeld's Newman) were all so hilarious and so made for the role. Bringing such a cast of all time funny men along with Cuba Gooding Jr. would not have been easy but the Director managed to get the best out of them, never missing a beat. 10/10 imho.My other all time funny movies: 1.

Thought it a lot funnier than actually hearing them. ""Rat Race"" had some good moments and imaginative bits, but pales in comparison to ""Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" which has the same basic plot. The big stars don't really have a chance to shine, and the lesser actors are eminently forgettable, except the dumb and dumber duo.. who are repulsive. Little wit and heavy slapstick and wildly improbable events. Busload of Lucille Ball wannabes good for a laugh.

I have to say that it is also quite possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen.  The jokes were incredibly original and were only brightened up by the actors.  Whoopi was wonderful, Cuba was hysterical, and Jon Lovitz and Kathy Najimy had me on the floor!

Having said that the premise about six people racing each other to bag two million dollars, while being spied and bet upon, is funny in itself. Writer Andrew Breckman and director Jerry Zucker manage it fit loads of very funny sketches and scenarios in to this quite short film. All the characters are hysterical in there own unique way. However I never felt that many characters were at their best, Rowan Atkinson as Enrico Pollini, was brilliant, but not Atkinsons best, the same applies to Whoopi Goldberg as Vera Baker and definitely John Cleese as Donald Sinclair, they all lacked the quality we come to expect from them. But the story line and premise makes this film work, and I would recommend people to go and see for themselves.",Rat Race

However, after careful consideration I have noticed that actually almost all of the funniest parts have been ""borrowed"" from other places.(May contain spoilers. You have been warned.) 1) What I think is the funniest part, when Jon Lovitz looks like Hitler, is almost exactly the same as a scene with Mr. Pitt in Seinfeld 2) In the ""Barbie museum"" scene when the Nazi is talking about the person the museum is built for, this is so incredibly similar to The Producers that it's not even funny 3) ""Now I know what you are thinking. Enrique is a girl's name. No pun intended"" ""What pun?"" This is also similar to the Roger Debris scene in The Producers: ""Masters Bialystock and Bloom I presume. Forgive the pun."" ""What pun?"" 4) Seth Green: ""I'm not gonna let that happen. And neither are you. And neither am I."" or something like that.

What we have here is an assembly of big name, big fee, comedic actors in a film designed for American audiences. The laughs are not necessarily predictable, and are not necessarily that funny either.Fair to say, there is something for everyone... and possibly some things for no-one! Perhaps this movie is the culmination of a study of American audiences, whereby, the results show that if you've had one good laugh, you feel like you have seen a good comedy. Yes, funny accents, poking fun, silly noises, humorous situations, confusion, and comedic corruption. As for the bit with the Jewish family and Hitler's car...

Several films have gone down this path before including ""Scavenger Hunt"" and ""Midnight Madness"" and now ""Rat Race.""  Each of these proves that your best bet is to rent the original and not waste time with insipid remakes.  This movie tries really, really hard to wring laughter out of some situations which are so overwritten and staged that Suspension of Disbelief becomes impossible.  The talents of several good actors are wasted attempting to wring laughs from a formula we've seen before.  Evidently Hollywood decided it had been long enough since we'd seen it before and decided to reintroduce this formula figuring there were enough people out there with no sense of having seen this before.

I won't do a spoiler here, but it begins when Jon Lovitz's family mistakenly visits the Barbie museum.  Barbie the doll? No, Klaus Barbie the Nazi! Their escape and the chase that follows is one of the funniest set pieces I've seen.  It's perfectly constructed and executed.  A real comedy gem, I thought.

Whoopi Goldberg is a fabulous actress, and Lanei Chapman is a beauty and a pleasure to watch. But that's all the good I can think of to say about this film. These actors' talents are completely wasted in this movie. All the characters are clichés and stereotypes and occasionally act as if they were cartoon characters. It's not enough to cast two comedians to make a good or funny movie. You need a good story, a good director and gags that are funny too. All sadly missing here. Rowan Atkinson does not match his silly role as an Italian. It's not enough to try to imitate an Italian accent to be funny, or to repeat some of the mimics from Mr. Bean. Well, my 5-year old daughter did laugh at the gags, so if your style is simple slapstick humour without sophistication rather than British/English humour or the type of humour you'll find in ""The Big Lebowsky"", then you might like this movie.

I really appreciate the amount of effort that went into filming this movie. Some of scenes like the helicopter chase and rocket launch were really well done from a technical standpoint, and must have been very costly to execute.There are dozens of funny moments peppered throughout the movie that really make this something special, like the female escort scene and the moment when Jon Lovitz pisses off the ""dyke"" motorcyclist and her gang.And the ending is truly fitting too.

Of course it has it's bad words from time to time but it's a great film even for the nine year old. It has many great actors like Seth Green, Joh Lovit, and especially the guy who played Mr. Bean.

I suspect that, due to the heated and strident political era we find ourselves currently, as well as the onset of social media ennui having reached maturation, this point in time is perfectly poised for a film like this. I loved it this time through. So far away from the daily screeds and hair-on-fire anxieties that have become life post-2016. It is a hidden gem, so offbeat and ridiculous. It was a true breath of fresh air. 9/10",Rat Race
205,nph19,"Tries hard to be ""mad mad world""",3,23 September 2019,"Some funny parts but there's a difference between funny and trying to be funny. This movie tried too hard capture the magic from 1963's ""It's a mad mad mad mad world"". Unsurprisingly it fell very short. It fell flat on it's face. If you want a good movie about a funny race to a hidden treasure with a great cast and funny cameos I'd suggest watching mad mad world instead of this embarrassing wannabe",Rat Race

Mr. Cleese is giving away 2 million, Cash. What would you do? Probably nothing that these characters in this film did! Would you cling to a cow suspended below a hot air balloon? Insult a squirrel seller and end up crashing at the bottom of a valley near dead tourists? Bet on Nuns hanging from curtains? Steal a rocket car that has about a million million horse power? Destroy an airports landing system? I think not! This film is pure fantasy. Designed for fat cats who sit and laugh at normal people and call us peasants.",Rat Race
207,JackD-3,A great movie to see if you want to laugh,8,22 August 2001,"I wanted to see a movie that would make me laugh, and this one really succeeded.  There are so many gags and stunts thrown in that it would be hard to single any of them out (besides which, I don't want to spoil any surprises by divulging them).  But I think what really made this film successful was the comic ability of the actors, each of whom turned in a solid performance.  Movies with a lot of manic energy can fall flat if the timing isn't quite right, in which case they become painful to watch. Remember Tom Hanks in ""Bachelor Party""?  Also with a large ensemble cast you run the risk of having the characters become indistinguishable from each other, or of having over the top caricatures that wear thin in a hurry. That didn't happen here. Seth Greene and Vince Vieluf were especially good, and the combination of Lanei Chapman as a driven yuppie and Whoppi Goldberg as her sweet natured long lost mother worked perfectly.  Rowan Atkinson would have become annoying if he were given more screen time, but as one of many in a large cast his character was quite funny and made a great contribution.  My only quibble with this movie was that the ending didn't seem quite right.  Without giving away what happens, I'll say that I think the writers got to the end and didn't know what to do, and in my opinion the result looked like a car running out of gas.  Despite that, I was laughing very hard through most of this movie as was the audience I saw it with.",Rat Race
208,Psycho666,A bunch of high school students could create a better comedy,5,9 September 2001,"After some reluctance I decided to see this promising comedy, even if the preview made it look like a cascade of childish visual jokes. Sadly, the preview is ten better better than the entire movie, I barely managed to stay until the end. It's so silly and low level it makes me wonder how they can release something like that, but then we got Bubble Boy and a whole lot more this summer... I did not know until now that Andy Breckman is also the guy who wrote horrible movies like ""True Identity"" and ""IQ"". Jerry Zucker should have stopped producing movies after Naked Gun 1, it would have been a great gift to every human being, including himself. If only someone would have told me that before, I would be 5 dollars richer!It's worth 5/10 for the 3 times I laughed, the last one was when I realized it was over so I could finally leave.",Rat Race
209,BoromirTheTall,Best movie I saw this summer,10,25 August 2001,"I saw the preview for Rat Race and was intrigued. The cast particularly interested me. Rowan Atkinson, or Mr. Bean as you may know him, makes an appearance, as well as Jon Lovitz, which really got me interested. The story is simple. Random people meet in a casino, and each receive a gold coin. They are brought together by the casino owner (John Cleese, another reason I wanted to see this movie) who gives them each a key. This key opens a locker in Silver City, New Mexico which contains 2 million dollars. They begin to race for it, and the events in between are hilarious.I give it a 4.5 out of 5!

The best part of the film is a storyline involving an entire busload of Lucy impersonators! They were hilarious in their red-headed, ditzy style. I especially enjoyed the performance of ""Lucy #1"" played skillfully by Deborah Theaker. I'm going to look her up here and see what else she's been in!The rest of the film was great too, I really enjoyed Seth Green and Rowan Atkinson, as well as the rest of this talented cast.

Despite a few inspired, off-the-wall comedic moments (like the bit where Jon Lovitz and his family stop at the Barbie Museum only to find out it has nothing to do with perfectly modeled plastic dolls), Rat Race is a smash-up derby orgy featuring hapless, screeching actors who are probably wishing they had better scripts to choose from.There are a few offensive performances in the movie, but none stand out as much as Cuba Gooding, Jr.  The sheer banality of his acting should cause the Academy to revoke his Oscar.  His bug-eyed, over-the-top performance dates back to Jar Jar Binks.  Somebody please give this man edgier material!  A close second is Rowan Atkinson, whose hacked-up Italian accent is meant to be funny but only comes across as crass and dated.Crippled by a lame script, even director Jerry Zucker, of the once famous Zucker-Abrams-Zucker team, can't rescue this rip-off of It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  When you have to resort to talking cows to get the audience to laugh, you know you are scraping the bottom of the comedy barrel.  By the time the alt-pop group Smashmouth makes an appearance (I know it was them because one of the characters told me so), I couldn't wait for the credits to roll.",Rat Race
216,erevno,"good, but could be better",7,7 September 2001,"just saw this today. Even though this is potentially a great cast, the true stars (as in if it weren't for them, this movie would probably tank) are Cube, Seth Green & Vince Vieluf, John Cleese and his lawyer Mr. Grisham (good joke by the way!) played by Dave Thomas, and the always delightful Rowan Atkinson. Sorry Whoopi . . . but Paul Rodriquez was better.Even though comedies usually get busted on for just concentrating on the jokes, and not the direction or acting, Jerry Zucker did a bang-up job with this movie. There are a few scenes where it's just side splitting funny, and you actually feel the action. The one downer on the movie is that it drags along at a few moments, most notably those scenes concentrating on Whoopi's quest. Even Wayne Knight's part as the Life-Line driver didn't really do anything for me.I still give it a 7/10, but it could have been better with a bit more timely writing, and to have the jokes spread out between the characters a little more.",Rat Race
217,pfgpowell,One and a half cheers,2,29 January 2006,"Within 20 minutes of Rat Race starting, you realise this is simply a rip-off of It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World  same premise, same manic situations in which a disparate collection race each other to lay claim to the prize, in this case $1 million. Admittedly, it's been many years since I watched the Mad, but I seem to remember the wacky situations the hunters found themselves weren't half as contrived, and so twice as funny. Rat Race has 'screenwriters had a hoot writing this one' written all over it. But the laughs don't really translate to the screen. There are one or two quite good jokes  a stereotypical Jewish family visit the Barbie Museum at daughter's insistence, only to find it is a museum in memory of that nasty Nazi Klaus Barbie and later take off in Hitler's limo. It's a gag only producers called Zucker could get away with, and to say it was contrived is being kind. But it was reasonably funny, as was the conceit that some people will bet on anything, even the price a hooker will charge for very outlandish services. Shame there were not more jokes like that, however much they are in bad taste. The rest of the film is though short on laughs unless you're desperate. (A coachload of Lucille Ball lookalikes heading for an I Love Lucy convention must have looked hilarious on paper, but never caught fire on screen.) The finale was puke-making. And I can't even be bothered to give it away.",Rat Race
218,bilweeler,Fun and Silly,7,6 July 2005,"Rat Race, 2001. Directed by Jerry Zucker (Airplane!) With: Whoopi Goldberg, John Cleese, Cuba Gooding Jr, Rowan Atkinson, Jon Lovitz I had the extreme pleasure of watching this film (DVD, actually) with some devoted ""Race"" fans. (I decided early on that ""Race"" fans sounds better than ""Rat"" fans.) They are always up for another trip to the ""Rat Race."" Like all good film fans, they love to share their best film experiences with others who they know will love it as much as they do. For that, I sincerely thank them.There are a few comedies I can watch over and over, and always break out laughing even though I know the punch lines. The short list includes ""Rustler's Rhapsody"" (don't tell me YOU haven't seen THAT one), ""The Money Pit"" (perhaps Tom Hanks' greatest film achievement) and ""The Blues Brothers"" (the original, not the sequel). Some films just hold up over time.""Rat Race"" is a mixture of reality TV, Cannonball Run, and Around the World in 80 Days. Well, actually a mixture of the best parts of those ingredients. There's slapstick, potty humor, and some good sight gags, and the old ""dangle a cow from a hot air balloon"" scene. What else could you want? I actually had about 90 minutes of pure escapist fun watching this one. I highly recommend it for anyone needing a short vacation from reality. In fact, it could probably get some good laughs if they show it on death row. It's THAT funnyin spots.",Rat Race

It's just the dumbest film this year but it's so funny for it. The plot is obvious, the characters fairly thin. But the situations are outstanding.

How can a movie filled with so many comedic stars and a simple plot for them to all be recognized not be a funny film. This film is wonderful.  I don't I've seen something this funny in a long while(since ""Meet the parents"" or ""Something about Mary"").  Besides the cheesy ending, which a movie like this probably couldn't avoid, it's a comic masterpiece.  I heard someone wrote that ""it has enough laughs to keep you awake.""  This movie has enough laughs to keep you on the floor.  I just couldn't help laughing at all the performances, especialy Whoppi Golberg. If you want to rent a comedy, rent this.7/10",Rat Race

So it could happen that such a movie receives a greater mark than a movie from a different category, which by the way has a greater artistic value. Anyway, if you like non-sense movies with absurd scenes, this is for you. The movie succeeds without clever jokes, with its hilarious scenes to make fun of the greedy or the ""don't know how to spend their money"" people. One absurd scene follows the other, and if you like such humor you will soon find yourself convulsed with laughter. Sometimes it may appear forced, but this is a characteristic for the genre.

This is without a doubt the least funny, least interesting, least intelligent movie I have seen this year and maybe in the last decade. What happened to Zucker? The poor guy used to have funny movies, not this slime he offered to the public. Rowan Atkinson, can you say an Italian Mr. Bean? Wayne Knight, can you say Newman from Seinfeld? Jon Lovitz, can you say any one of his boring bits from Saturday Night Live? John Cleese, can you say the manager from Fawlty Towers? So on and so on and so on!!! Don't let me forget the leading romantic couple...its hard to believe they could be any worse than they were in ""Road Trip"", but guess what, they are in this garbage. Couldn't Zucker come up with any funny ideas? Oh wait, a cow tied to a hot air balloon....ha-ha-ha not! Wasn't funny. Wait, the dog and the heart....nope! The pierced tounge...zzzzzzzzzz! Ooooooo, I know, the Hitler car and the cigarette lighter....nada! I'm glad I checked this out from the library so luckily I didn't have to pay a rental fee. My only wish is that IMDB would allow you to give a ""0"" rating on movies, because that is the rating it deserves. Instead I gave it a ""1"". By the way, Mr. Zucker, if you are having nightmares in your sleep after making this dribble, its probably Stanley Kramer's spirit causing it. I think you owe his ghost a public apology.",Rat Race

I was hesitant, however, because the trailer seemed to show an awful lot of very funny over-the-top bits.  A friend went to see it last night and told me nothing about the movie except 1) It was hilarious and 2) the trailer _didn't_ include some of the funniest parts of the movie.So, after reading a few reviews here and avoiding spoilers at all costs, I went to see it tonight.  I gotta say, I'm so glad I went.  My friend was right, there were a lot of other great scenes!I hate it when people tell me about a movie before I go see it, so I'll not reveal anything here.  The cast was a great blend of characters, and I really can't pick a favorite.  They all had their high points.  One of the side bets that was made was truly ""off the wall"" and really reminded me of classic Abrams, Zucker, and Zucker stuff that we saw see in Airplane, Top Secret, or Naked Gun.  You know, the weird, completely off-plot stuff that happened in the background that made you watch the movie again and again to see more and more of it...  but I digress...The bits that were in the trailer were funny, but didn't have quite the impact after having seen them a dozen times already.  The scenes built around those bits were the highlights that stood out for me.  People have commented here about the ending...  I'll leave that for you to decide.My $0.02....  Later!

It also copies the bad ending.There were many absolutely hilarious moments in the movie...my favorites were the gambling games of John Cleese and Dave Thomas (Pepto-Bismol??), the monster-truck rally slow-motion sequence,  Cuba Gooding's reaction to the Lucy impersonator's confession, Rowan Atkinson singing the wrong song lyrics from what's being played on the radio, the squirrel-lady's shortcut, and the girls in the rocket car looking out the window at a certain projectile in the air.But not everything hits the mark...there were some things that didn't work. As much as I like Wayne Knight, the whole sequence with the heart was pretty bad.  And the ending....yikes.  Just about anything would have been better than that.  It's pretty sad when that made me yearn to see something like a bunch of people flying off a firetruck's ladder.  At least that still had zaniness written all over it.The acting is really good...I think comic acting is much tougher than dramatic.  Kudos to John Cleese, Dave Thomas, Cuba Gooding, Seth Green, Vince Vieluf, Rowan Atkinson, and Amy Smart.  You all made the movie to me. It wouldn't have worked unless you went over the top.

It's full of the most nonsense situations that can exist, but I think that it shows, with a little exaggeration, the indiscriminated desire for money that we have today. And it's surprising. The humor is so well-timed! I remember the hilarious moments when we discover that the gentlemen called the bitch only for a bet, and when the blond (I don't remember the name) changes all her cute looking when she discover her boyfriend with another woman. It's some impossible appeal, I recognize, like the scene when the heart starts to pulse only with the eletricity, but it has so many funny and convincing moments that we forgot it and start to laugh anyway!

I remember watching this movie in like 2003. I was like 14 (it came out in 01). I thought the movie was hilarious. But now that I'm older and understand more about movies, this movie is more than hilarious. When they first made this movie they put (in 2001) so-so actors in it. And most of those actors are in lots of really good/funny movies now.They have big names like Breckin Meyer, Cuba Gooding Jr., Amy Smart, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Wayne Knight, Seth Green, Dave Thomas, Jon Lovitz(who is just hilarious). Most of those actors were pretty much nobodies in 2001.This movie is one of those movies thats gets funnier the second time you watch it. I think it hangs up there with ""Strange Wilderness"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", except this movie is actually PG-13 and those are R. Which makes it even better.

I've gotta say though that this one wasn't bad either. Many of the scenes were really funny and I thought it was a worthy effort. The only thing that bothered me was the ending, which was so unbelievably bogus and corny, I felt like I was gonna gag. That part seemed like it was written by Anne Landers or Aunt Bee, or some other old lady, ruining the whole wacky Bundy-type image of the movie. I really thought John Cleese would have had more class than to be involved in a dorky ending like that. I'd be willing to bet he wasn't happy about it.I recommend this movie for all those who enjoy slapstick comedy, but turn it off before it ends!

I was watching this in a movie theater in Scotland and apart from me, nobody seemed to get the joke... I wonder how it was in America (or anywhere else for that matter).

Okay, maybe not the finish, but seeing people doing mosh pit dives was pretty cool. Every single actor/actress was stupendous, with the stand-outs being the Cody Brothers, Enrico Pollino, and Randy Pear. From the jeep going up the airplane tower, to Pear's accidental impersonation of Hitler in the WWII Veterans gathering, everything was great. Before the first quarter of the film was done, me and my friend were hoarse from laughing, starting with the idiotic grin that the other Cody Brother had when he pulled the cord in the credits.

245,theriddler,One Of The Funniest Movies Ever....Underrated!,8,1 February 2002,"Rat Race (8/10) is one of the most underrated comedies I've ever seen. When it was in theatres it really flew under the radar but now Im seeing it gain quite a cult following. Its the story of a casino owner (played brilliantly and big-teethed by Jon Cleese) who offers a select few, but zany people ( I believe there are 7) the chance to win 2 million dollars, hidden in a locker in Silver City, NM. The hialrious array of characters includes a family man who is forced to drag his family along o nthe wild chase (Jon Lovitz), an uptight lawyer ( Breckin Meyer), two brothers, one with a serious speech impediment (Seth Green and...I've forgotten the other brother's name), and more. This underused genre can be incredibly funny, especially when everything thta can go wrong does. Well paced, appropriate ending, hilarious acting, what mroe could you want in a fun, entertaining movie?",Rat Race

I contemplated ring up the tv service and advsing them I wanted a refund due to a constant buzzing on the soundtrack. It turns out, that this was not a fault, but the dialog of the film! Oh me, oh my.This bought nothing to the genre that cannonball (and it's subsiquent sequel) did not. Infact, alot of the time it was like pulling your own teeth. Y'know, you put all that hard work into getting something out of it and you're left only with an agonising pain and a blood covered Bradford Bulls shirt!Not that I was expecting ""The fast and the furious"" or ""Airplane"", But I at least fancied a laugh. Unfortunately, they were few and far between. When they did actually approach it was with enough warning that you knew the punchline before the execution. There was nothing in here that we haven't seen at least twice a year on the usual straight to video fare you find on the 'two-for-three-quid-shelf at the rental shop.My opinion? Get 6 mates together, Rent a couple of those ride-on lawn-mowers and film yourselves chasing one another to sheffield in a bid to be the first one to a family sized jar of Marmite!! It'll be a wee bit more costly, but at least you'll feel you've achived a more worthwhile movie than the makers of this tosh!**/*****",Rat Race
247,Bromios,"Worth watching, just for the plot",7,7 November 2009,"This movie is a silly, exaggerated, unbelievable, and a great homage to Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.The cast is packed full of comedic stars, with stand out performances from Rowan Atkinson, Cuba Gooding Jr, Wayne Kight, and John Cleese. The most impressive aspect of the movie was the plotting. Time after time, the movie morphed from one ridiculous situation to the next, and each time, if not believable, it felt appropriate. The narrative also featured a number of repeated elements, such as a upside down flying cow, which added a bizarre continuity to a plot that ran rapidly along a series of fracture lines.Do not watch this movie for any insights or to be informed, but if you are looking for a night of laughter and entertainment, this fits the bill.",Rat Race

Anyways, Rat Race has passed my line of satisfaction and is one of only a handful of movies I have seen more than two times.Why is it so good then? Well, it contains good actors such as John Cleese (Fawlty Towers), Rowan Aktinson (Mr. Bean) and Cuba Gooding Jr. (Pearl Harbor) and more. Furthermore, it has an easy yet excellent story, a story which everyone can enjoy and become involved with. The characters are interesting as well which makes this movie even better.You will definitely laugh when you see this movie, no matter if you watch it for the second, third or the fourth time (which I am sure you will do)!",Rat Race

He plants six unique gold coins in six normal vending machines. The people who win them are : two down-on-their-luck brothers one of whom can't talk properly because of his pierced tongue, a reunited mother and daughter, a referee hated by thousands of Dallas Cowboy fans, a strict lawyer who isn't to mad on gambling, a scruffy Italian immigrant who falls asleep at the most unexpected of times and a dad on holidays with his demanding family. Sinclair informs them that nearly 600 miles away, in Silver City, New Mexico, there's a locker with $ 2,000,000 inside. He gives them each a key to that locker. They all run off to the airport, but when the two brothers pull down the radar tower, they have to go the whole way without planes. The things that follow include monster truck competitions, insane squirrel ladies, dive-bombing helicopters, heart transplants and several hijackings. What they don't know is that Sinclair and his billionaire buddies are betting on who'll get there first. That's why they call it RAT race. I read several reviews for this and there are some people who think this is crap compared to the original Stanley Kramer film. I haven't yet seen it so I don't know how good it is. But no matter how good it is this will always be a masterpiece. It is piled-high with zany characters, belly laughs and an all-star cast. I remember when I first saw this I was guffawing like an idiot. It is also a much better way to spend the time than stupid overly-cheezily family films, Stuart Little to name a few.

Critics hammered it for being a remake of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, or accused it of reverting back to MMMMW's formula of selling the movie with a hundred big names who do little more than mug for the camera. But these guys are all busting their butts to entertain us. Yes, post-adolescents will be able to see most of the gags coming a mile away, but when their execution surpasses our expectations what's not to like? This is, after all, directed by the same Zucker who gave us Airplane, and it shares the same DNA. Watch it with your kids, and appreciate the ending that leaves them with a nice message as a bonus.

Together they create one laugh after another--a car climbing poll, a cow flying high, an air-ground war between a chopper and a truck, Hitler's car and a team of wealthy greedy bettors all will make you roar with laughter!

I went into this movie with low expectations because the trailers were not that funny and I was expecting a movie like 'Scavenger Hunt' with Tony Randall and Scatman Crothers.  The truth is I started laughing as soon as it came on. The credits are amusing with the entire cast as cut out cartoons with a strange calypso tune in the background.  There were some small parts where the jokes dragged a little bit and the timing was too slow, and the ending doesn't give a big enough pay-off for a hilarious movie. For the most part though, I would laugh for 5 minutes wait for another set-up and laugh for 5 minutes more.  Whoopi Goldberg's part is small enough to not go past the point of annoyance, John Cleese is a hoot, and the rest of the cast brings equal amounts of funny to the film.

But if your IQ is lower than that-- especially if it's significantly lower--you will laugh yourself silly.If your IQ is above that level, you'll find your average Simpsons or Seinfeld episode ten times funnier than this movie, so don't bother watching it.

I agree with the many comments about Jon Lovitz, his `Hitler' scene is the highlight of the movie.   I also rented ""Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and honestly, I liked ""Rat Race"" better.

263,ticktockcrocodile,I love squirrels!,5,6 July 2002,"You know the kind of movie where from the moment you see the first preview, you think, ""Wow, that looks great! I gotta see that!""? And then when you actually do see it, it's nothing like your expectations? It actually EXCEEDS them? Well, ""Rat Race"" is that kind of movie!From the opening credits, when those goofy little cutouts of the cast are dancing around and beating each other up, I knew we were in for a treat. And what a treat it was... one that built up with each laugh, each scene, making you want more, more, more, until the climax at the very end where we see that these screwballs are really great people after all.Now, first off, I would like to note that this movie would NOT have been so great if I had not watched it with our TV Guardian (which is a handy little machine that filters out bad language by reading the closed captioning). I can tell from the many times that the TV momentarily muted out that the language in this movie is quite heavy, but if you have the capability to watch it without hearing the ""cussing"" I say go for it! However, just so nobody gets the wrong idea, there ARE a couple of things that credit a quick averting of the eyes.Anyway, now that I have my moral problems with this movie out of the way, I can continue with my review! I was so impressed by the immense talent of this cast- John Cleese, Whoopi Goldberg, Breckin Meyer, Kathy Najimy, Jon Lovitz, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Rowan Atkinson, and yes, even Seth Green were all magnificent. Their excellent portrayals of these completely whacked-out people somewhat make you wonder what their real personal lives are like! And the star cameos, such as Dean Cain, Paul Rodriguez, Wayne Knight, and the always great Kathy Bates, were done to hilarious lunatic perfection.One thing that really struck me about the way this movie was done was that each team had so many ""mini-adventures""... and each was funnier than the last! Randy and Bev and the kids visiting the ""Barbie"" museum, stealing Hitler's car, and crashing the WWII vet reunion; Vera and Merril's ride on the ""rocket car"", trip with the mentally ill, and scafuffle with the Squirrel Lady; Enrico's sleeping problem, his ride with the EMT and chase after the heart, and his bug-like splatting on the train... the list goes on and on.  Normally, it seems like in a movie such as this, after every excursion the characters go on, the movie looses something of its charm and originality. Not in this one! The exact opposite is true here... every time they sidestep danger, we wait expactantly to see what will happen next... and each adventure is always better than the last one.I'd have to say that my favorite scenes were on the bus full of Lucy impersonators. I have always been a big Lucille Ball fan and the idea of having an entire bus full of Lucys was a stroke of true genius. The part when they all start crying like Lucy (""Waaaaaaaaah!!!"") cracked me up. Also, as I'm sure you can guess by the title of this review, I really enjoyed the Kathy Bates character and subsequent crash down the cliff. And of course, who could forget one of the greatest running gags in comedy history... the cow and the balloon. Boy, I sure would like to shake the hand of whoever thought that up.Anyway, all in all, it was a pretty great movie, full of memorable characters and impressive performances. I really liked the ending, too. Altho some people have said it was preachy or too contrived, I say it was the best way to close out what had been two hours of nonstop riotous laughter. And the ending shot, where the cast is being held up by the audience in the concert... priceless!! However, the inappropriate language and the ""other"" things (Randy and Bev's accidental signal to the biker, Harold's rather inappropriate request to Vicky, and the Pierced Girl's... um... unshyness) prohibit me from giving this a perfect 10 rating. I'll have to go with 5 1/2 out of 10.You should have bought a squirrel!",Rat Race

269,crisps,The only film showing I ever walked out of. Dreadful.,1,17 January 2002,"I went to see this film with my brother, not knowing very much about it before hand.From the animated opening credits I already had my doubts, and not least because Rowan Atkinsons's mug had shown up. (He was funny in Blackadder, and pretty much nothing else)The film began and the level of 'humour' was so bad it made me feel embarrassed that this film had been made and even more so that I was watching it Still, I sat there hoping it might get better. Of course it didn't. The list of banal and pathetic 'jokes' was unbelievable.  Abused live organs, balloon trapped flying cows, a Klaus Barbie Museum, an improbable Italian narcoleptic, oh it's hurting my brain to recall such stuff.For the people who have reviewed this and left comments of praise and adoration I can only wonder if perhaps they actually saw a different film from the trite I watched. Before anyone thinks I don't have a sense of humour I'd like to state that I certainly do, and I will sit through and enjoy many things, but this just wasn't funny.In the UK this film was given a 12 certificate. I think the classification system should have been inverted and the film should have been restricted to those only UNDER 12. it would have saved me the mental torture at least. Not even looking at Amy Smart could relieve the anguish.I had laughed 2-3 times, but sadly not at any comedy. I was laughing at how brutally bad it was I laughed at the fact I had paid to watch this bilge. I laughed at some of the naive youngsters in the audience who thought it was mildly amusing.We had given it a fair chance. We had sat through 75 minutes out of the 112 minutes it ran but could take no more when John lovitz broke into the Veteran's reunion and was bizarrely acting like Hitler, like yeah, I'd start sounding German and doing Heil salutes if I'd choked on a cigar lighter. Anyway, not funny. It sucked big time. We walked out promising ourselves never to watch a film on a whim again.",Rat Race
270,randjuke,Unexpectedly funny,7,29 May 2002,"Unlike some other reviewers who liked the trailer then were disappointed at the movie, I had the opposite experience.  When I saw the trailers, I thought it looked like a bad rip-off of ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", so when I saw the movie itself my expectations were relatively low.I was surprised to find that I was laughing all through the movie.  The gags and jokes come fast and heavy, much like ""Airplane"" which Jerry Zucker also had a hand in.  Sure, some of the jokes fall flat but there is always another one coming soon.The first 15 minutes or so are basically devoted to setting up the plot and introducing characters - I was asking myself when is something funny going to happen here, but in retrospect this was necessary in order to make the later gags work.  Often times a joke will be related to something that happened much earlier in the movie, so there is a constant element of surprise and recognition that makes it that much funnier.  Characters who are ""set up"" as nice normal people are revealed to be maniacs; this is a recurring theme and is very funny (I especially liked Amy Smart's pilot character).No, not everything works.  The ending is pretty hokey.  I didn't care much for Whoopi Goldberg's and Rowan Atkinson's characters but there is so much else going on that it doesn't seem much to matter.  A final comment is that this is a movie I could watch with my kids and not feel uncomfortable. There is some foul language (though not as bad as what my daughter hears on the school bus every day, she assures me) and you see the side of a woman's breast but otherwise most of Rat Race is G-rated.",Rat Race

I laughed during the trailer of the movie and during the movie itself, I don't think I was able to breathe that much. This movie is definitely one of the funniest of the summer. I don't think a better cast could have been picked for this movie. I expected Cuba Gooding Jr. to be funny but I can honestly say that every person in this movie was funny, even that pierced chick. So if your in for a good laugh, check this movie.

280,cmdev,"Something for everyone, but not that great",5,8 August 2021,"I feel pretty conflicted when it comes to rating this movie. On one hand, you have a busload of pure nonsense. There are countless moments which feel like they came straight out of a Salvador Dali painting, which are completely out of place because this movie still appears to take itself somewhat seriously. And while I do understand that some things in a wacky comedy like this are tongue-in-cheek, it lacks the charm that makes other Jerry Zucker comedies so fun. Some of the ""jokes"" in this movie are so asinine, it feels like I'm being beaten on the head with a pipe wrench. If you have a dry sense of humor, you probably won't enjoy much of this movie.On the other hand, there are some genuinely hilarious scenes and decent comedic acting that had me close to tears at some points. The slapstick elements mostly fall flat, but somehow the more cerebral jokes land incredibly well. Overall, it leans more toward the PG side of things, but at least it isn't relying on toilet humor too much. If you're a parent you should feel fine about showing this to children under 13. Some of the jokes will fly over a kid's head, but it feels generally like it's directed toward a young audience. I first saw Rat Race as a young kid, and it teleports me straight back to my childhood, back when everything made more sense. The big, stupid, slapstick action scenes like the ones that fill this movie were funny, just because. Now, as an adult, I'm not laughing as much, but it gets an extra star for the nostalgia.This has to be the most 2001 movie ever made. Obviously, since it was made that year, it nails the aesthetic, but you also have to consider the fact that Rat Race came out a month before 9/11. It has an innocent mood that you don't really see much these days. It was a simpler time, and I honestly think it shows. This may be hyperbole, but I think it captures a feeling that we as a nation lost that year.If you're in the mood for a light-hearted comedy with a little bit of something for everyone, check it out. Otherwise it's pretty skippable.",Rat Race
281,piecaptain,absolutely brilliant,10,10 September 2005,"i honestly do not believe that we will ever see a more clever or well written ensemble comedy for roughly 10 years. it is well written with about 4 dozen good jokes and a whole lot of cheesy heart filled moments. there is not too much swearing, which is good. I feel there are a couple of people who deserve acknowledgments. The first is Andy Breckman for his brilliant screenplay. The next is Jon Lovitz for giving the best performance in the whole movie. I can't leave out Jerry Zucker for direction. Last, i need to credit Lovitz for the genius Nazi scene. See this movie if you have not it is brilliant. From the piecaptain himself, that is really rare.",Rat Race
282,Coasterfreak10,A funny movie,9,16 January 2006,"I did not see this film in the theaters, but I had seen the previews for it. They made it look like it was going to be funny and fast paced. It was out of the theaters for about two years before I finally was convinced to watch it. All of my friends were saying, ""Have you seen Rat Race?"" I always had to say no. Then they always told me how funny it was. I finally decided to rent it from Blockbuster.This movie was absolutely HILARIOUS! I would describe this movie as a constant bombardment of jokes and funny actions. It is so funny what a bunch of random people will do for two million dollars. My favorite character was Vera Baker, played by Whoppie Goldberg. If you have never seen Rat Race, head on down to the nearest movie rental store, make a bowl of popcorn, and get ready to laugh your head off for two hours.",Rat Race

285,tvking1285,This is quite possibly the funniest film of all time,10,14 August 2001,"I went into a sneak preview of 'Rat Race' knowing it would be funny, but when I came out, it quickly replaced 'Evolution' as the funniest film of the year. Not only is 'Rat Race' the funniest film of the year, it is quite possibly the funniest film of all time.  Audiences don't seem to care about real comedies anymore. Those damn sex comedies have replaced them and most of them don't deliver real laughs. Now comes 'Rat Race', a movie that plays and acts like a remake of the 1963 epic comedy 'It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World', which was directed by Stanley Kramer. 'Rat Race' was directed by Jerry Zucker from a script by Andrew Breckman and thanks to great writing and great direction, 'Rat Race' is one uproariously funny movie.  So what's it about? Six people win on slot machines and they receive a coin that says ""You're a winner. Come to Guest Services"". They are sent up to a penthouse where we meet Donald Sinclair (John Cleese). He offers them a chance to win $2,000,000. These people include Owen Templeton(Cuba Gooding Jr.), Enrico Pollini(Rowan Atkinson), Randy Peer (Jon Lovitz), Nick Schaefer(Breckin Meyer), Duane Cody (Seth Green  and a woman named Vera(Whoopi Goldberg). At first, they're not interested, but once they chase each other down the stairs (briliantly to the song ""Who Let The Dogs Out"" by Baha Man), the race begins. No more of the plot will be given because it deals with sub plots on all six teams. There are also more and more characters in the story.  The movie also has stand out scenes featuring Seth Green and Vince Vieluf. Most of their scenes are very funny.  But if you think the last scene is going to be set in a hospital like in 'Mad World', you are dead wrong. Despite how funny the movie is, the ending might get a mixed review. I won't give it away due to the fact that I promised no spoilers, just crtique and part of the plot. Just see the movie for yourself.  If you see one movie on the weekend of August 17-19, see 'Rat Race'. It's better than going to see 'American Pie 2', 'Captain Correli's Mandolin' and 'American Outlaws'. The movie is rated PG-13 and parents, bring the kids. This is the funniest movie of the year and quite possibly the funniest movie of all time. Don't miss it. If you miss it, you will be sorry.",Rat Race

The cast is a mixture of well-known comedians who play the perfect rolls. It is a spin-off of ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" and is even funnier. It is about different people who came to Las Vegas for vacation. They are all picked by the Venetian hotel manager who is played by John Cleese (very FUNNY). He tells them that hidden in a locker in New Mexico is a duffel bag with two million dollars in it and that the first one that gets to the locker gets to keep it all.

My friend (who laughs all the time at most anything) was actually upset at the end of this movie.  We got the tickets for free - and we were still upset at having wasted 2 hours of our lives.This movie was worse than Godzilla.

I don't recall hearing anything about this film when it came out.  It's got some very very funny moments--the truck and the tower, the cow and the balloon, the squirrel lady...we ended up watching the whole thing, at most points giggling uncontrollably--and I'm wondering *why* I never heard anything about it.

Wisely, relatively little time is spent setting up the pieces on the board, and the pacing is brisk to move from joke to joke quickly. A solid ensemble cast and lots of novel ideas make this cross-country race very entertaining and engaging just about all the way through. Just do yourself a favour and turn it off when the band Smashmouth appears, because the ending is unnecessarily moralistic and preachy, and takes the fun out of the rest of the experience. These are not characters we are meant to like, so why should we care if they learn a lesson, in an unconvincing way to boot? Maybe with a bit more shamelessness this would have been a total triumph, but as it is this is an example of the journey being more important than the destination. All told there is too much hilarity to write it all off based on the ending. Just turn it off at Smashmouth.",Rat Race

But unlike ""Airplane!"", a great many miss the mark this time around.  There are jarring plot holes everywhere you turn.  Also unlike ""Airplane!"", a few scenes in ""Rat Race"" are just dreadful (including one involving Rowan Atkinson on a train that can only be summed up by: ""What were they THINKING???"")Fortunately there are enough yuks in-between the cringes to make this a pleasant night's rental.  The final scene is quite clever and much more satisfying than ""Mad Mad World""'s ending.  The movie is well paced, and the first-rate cast does a very reasonable job, especially as this is the sort of vehicle in which many stars would mail their performances in.  (Jon Lovitz, Seth Green, and Cuba Gooding are especially good; John Cleese and Dave Thomas turn in nice extended cameos, but Whoopi Goldberg wasn't given near enough to do.)Overall, a 6 out of 10.

297,Felius,"A stupid, unfunny pile of trash.",1,27 June 2002,"Last night I watched ""Rat Race"" - one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.In the video store I picked up this movie on DVD, noted the stellar cast and good reviews on the cover and thought that it could be worth watching.  I could not have been more wrong.  Sometimes when you watch a movie you're disappointed because your expectations are too high, or because you're just not in the right mood to appreciate that sort of film.  Those excuses don't apply here though, because I was in the mood for a lighthearted comedy, and my only expectation was that it should be funny.This movie should never have been released.  It's the most unfunny rubbish I've ever seen, and an incredible waste of a talented cast; John Cleese, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg just to mention three actors that probably wake up every night in a cold sweat wishing they'd never agreed to be in this trash.The plot, such as it is, is this:  A wealthy Las Vegas casino owner (played by John Cleese) comes up with a scheme to entertain his high-rollers.  He places six special tokens in his slot machines, then gathers the six winners together in one room and tells them he's sending them on a race to recover $2 million dollars which is stored in a locker in the train station of some remote little town.  The only rule, he tells them, is that there are no rules.  The first person there wins the money.  It's actually a decent premise for a movie like this, along the same lines as ""Cannonball Run"".Unfortunately, the script feels like it was put together by a bunch of 10 year old boys locked in a room and fed red cordial and speed until they went spastic.  I certainly don't mind unusual, absurd or unrealistic situations in a comedy, but that's not the problem here.  The problem is that the director has relied on slapstick and visual gags, and has telegraphed the punchline of almost every single joke.  It was so predictable and banal in its stupidity that I was literally uttering the characters next lines in advance during some parts of the movie.There were a few funny moments.  Cleese's character and his high-rolling gamblers will bet on anything, and the setups for their wagers were generally funny.  There were one or two other gags that I laughed at, but so often a funny moment was spoilt by dragging it out far too long, or setting it up so transparently that you were over it by the time it arrived.I wanted to turn it off, but I was hoping desperately that it would improve. Instead it got steadily worse as the film progressed, until it all culminated in the most sickly sweet and preachy ending I've seen in years. I think it says a lot that I laughed more during the two minute blooper reel on the DVD than during the movie.Do yourself a favour and skip this movie, or recommend it to your worst enemies.",Rat Race

301,tmrmwel,"Same old sh#t, new wrapping",3,11 February 2002,"Here's a film with a lot of good points; if you've never watched a single comedy before in your entire life that is. The story starts of by introducing the characters at a hotel, and they all end up, rather ""surprisingly"", in the top suite. It turns out to be the eccentric millionaire/ billionaire Donald Sinclair's work of doing. He is offering them all a chance to win $1000000, and so the race starts. For it is the race the film is about; it is only the winner of the race to a deposit box that gets the money. The race itself is made up of the contenders mixing into all kinds of weird situations, which is all a very good idea but which has also been done before. Remember Cannonball Run and Cannonball Run II? I would have thought two VERY similar films about a race was enough! But apparently Jerry Zucker did not agree with me, and he felt the need to make a film containing the scenes that was refused for classics such as Airplane and the Naked gun movies. The film is not chemically free from good and enjoyable moments; David Sinclair, played by non other than John Cleese, and his lot of eccentric billionaire friends make up the most of these, but some very rare seconds of other laughable happenings also occur.

Never a dull moment while watching it, it enlightened me to see that all my favorite actors were in the movie. I loved seeing the adorable Rowan Atkinson appear in the movie, remembering his early performances from his days as Mr. Bean, I thought that he was a delightful choice to be in this particular kind of story. This all star cast (Whoopi Goldberg, Jon Lovitz, Seth Green, Cuba Gooding Jr.) are up to their usual scene stealing performances to go on this journey of destructful hunting for what is promised to make them rich. Awaiting for the one person that gets there first $2 million dollars at the finish line. Every actor gives a very funny performance that I enjoyed each and every one of. I thought this movie was very interesting and geniusly written for each character portrayed by each talented actor we've all seen and loved in our favorite movies growing up.

John Cleese shows off more of that irrisitible Monty Python charm as Donald Sinclair, the very rich casino owner who challenges six random people to a race for two million dollars hidden in a safe in New Mexico. Whoever gets there first gets it all. And that's all you need to know for a hilarious slapstick caper movie like this one. All the actors are great in their roles, particularly Cuba Gooding Jr. as the unanimously-despised football ref Owen Templeton, Jon Lovitz as the frustrated family man Randy Pear, and Rowan Atkinson, who revives the old Mr. Bean charm with the narcoleptic Italian tourist Enrico Pollini. These characters are pitted against a by-the-books lawyer (Breckin Meyer), a re-united mother and daughter (Whoopi Goldberg, Lanei Chapman), and two scheming twin brothers (Seth Green, Vince Vieluf.) Oh yeah, and a thieving hardware guy. It's near impossible to say which of these characters has an advantage in the race because the movie is so unpredictible. So, just sit back and relax until the ending, which is funny, and the eventual conclusion which is downright hilarious. Saying much more would be a spoiler, so go see it for yourself!

Some boring patrons and a excentric tycoon who run a casino choose by random a group of individuals which engage in a race to get 2 millions dollars. The individual zeal and greedy is overcome when they finally got the money and found a best and humanistic choice: donate dollars to a NGO, Feed the Earth. Along the lines of Farrely brothers but without their intelligence and class sensibility, Rat Race is neither a comedy nor a movie.

Another funny character is Randall Pear (Jon Lovitz) who is a middle aged Jewish man who ends up stealing Adolf Hitlers car and then gatecrashing a anti Nazi rally, it is the set pieces like this which really bring this film to life.

It's a simple situational comedy that is exaggerated and absurd, but undoubtedly hilarious. It's sheer brilliance comes from the excellent comic timings of the cast - Rowen Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg. Brecker Mayer etc. Had excellent acting chops and were able to craftily bring this story to life. The best things about this movie is that the jokes build on top of one another and get crazier and crazier as time goes on, and you'll laugh your head off. Don't hesitate in watching this gem.",Rat Race
320,dawolf42,"The best laughs since the Pink Panther or ""Baby's Day Out""",9,6 October 2001,"Movies often provide good laughs. One here, one there. A smart remark, a funny moment and you laugh. On to the next scene. 'Rat Race' is one of those movies where the sequence of hilarious moments can get so rapid and intense that before you even have started to laugh about that last scene the next funny moment is already showing while others are being introduced. The result is an extremely pleasant and relaxing laugh attack which will hurt your belly. This movie I will gladly, happily, see time and time again, adding it to all time hardy laugh favorites such  as ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" and ""Baby's Day Out"".I must point out that this movie has one of the most peculiar car chases - and not even specifically because one of the people is on foot....Entertainment factor: 5/5 (great!)Message: hey, it's just a *fun* movie""Must See"" Value: you mean you're not watching it yet?",Rat Race

To say I was blown away by how truly funny this film is puts it mildly. ""Rat Race"" is a gas... this is the first film in a long time that I felt was worth the $10 admission. The entire cast is exceptional... even Whoopi Goldberg (who I'm not a big fan of). No, the plot isn't very deep... but the film is just plain funny! Definitely see this one in the theater before it gets away!",Rat Race

I generally despise Whoopi, but she was the best part of this cast of lifeless cardboard drones. This is not a funny movie. I think I cracked half of a smile once or twice at most, and my expectations were in the basement when I went into this, too. I would go into more detail but ""Rat Race"" just isn't worth it. Don't even rent it. If you're thinking, ""heck, the kids will think it's funny.""Don't. The kids in front of me didn't laugh once and kept muttering, ""this sucks.""The kids are all right.",Rat Race

325,dreammuffin,I can't believe this movie is only number three!!!! (Some spoilers),10,22 August 2001,"Such a sin!!!! Such a travesty of Justice that this movie only came in at numbers three at the box office!!!! Everyone must see this film and bring all their friends with them!!!!I don't know where to start talking about how much I enjoyed this fine screwball comedy film!!!! The cast was amazing!!! The Direction was superb!!! The grip guy gripped his well!!!! The extras did a wonderful job holding up Jon Lovitz!!!!I wish I could share second-hand the orgasmic glee I experienced while watching this movie, But I'm afraid you will have to see it for yourself. I'll just highlight my favorite elements:*The chase/action scenes- so well done with perfectly timed humor interwoven with the action. I especially enjoyed Vince Vieluf and Seth Green's action sequences together. They should be giving props for doing some of the most unappreciated hard work in the movie business.*The sick screwball humor- from the flying cow, to the flying doo to the flying heart, this movie had me cracking up every second. A stand-out scene was Cuba Gooding Jr's hilarious description of his facetious wife's 'birth' (I swear, when I get this movie on tape I will rewind it to him saying ""Vagina"" in that creepy, panicked voice.) And every scene that featured Rowan Atkinson as a silly Italian man with a sleeping disorder had me busting a gut most painfully.*The subtle comments on our society-In a day of so many heavy-handed dramas on what is wrong with the world, sometimes it takes a screwball comedy to impress a wider audience. I loved the relationship between Whoopi Goldberg and Lanai Chapman's character's, from the little time they were on the screen you got a feeling for their differing value systems-One spends all her money to finally meet her daughter, squarely putting relationships before money, the other is clearly in it for the cash, not even stopping to talk with the nice lady who gave them directions to the short-cut to Silver City. (Well, she seemed nice;))*The love stories- Short and sweet. I thought Amy Smart and Nick Shaffer were so cute together, and Vince Vieluf was a scream showing off his piercings to the beautiful girl in the car beside him. If I get it on videotape I will most surely rewind it to the look on his face when she lifts her shirt and shows him her goodies. (only a side-view, don't worry parents)*The heart underneath it all- Yeah, the ending was a bit silly, and nobody needs to hear ""Hey now"" by Smash Mouth again in this life. (or any) But the characters end up so likable and the man who speaks for ""Feed The Children ""at the end gave me a real feeling of the seriousness of those with real problems in comparison with the silliness  that had ensued beforehand.",Rat Race

I heard your name on the credit listing and got scared, but your performance was very limited, much to my delight.Thank You Seth Green.  You topped your performance from the Austin Powers movies by being the perfect model of how most big brothers are.  Seth, along with Vince Vieluf on their own would make this movie worth while.  As the Cody Brothers, you get to see them ride a balloon, a monster truck, and even up vertical at one point.Thank You Rowen Atkinson.  Bean was funny enough on its own, but with a sleeping disorder and Italian accent, it's the greatest.Thank you Kathy Bates.  I want a squirrel.THANK YOU JON LOVITZ!!!  You are the heart and soul of this movie.  I can't explain why, because it really would spoil the movie (all Jon's really good parts aren't in the trailers...)Thanks to everyone else who made and starred this movie.

Very good/funny actors (Seth Green, Rowan Atkinson, John Cleese, Wayne Knight) who are stuck in a movie that just makes you gag and wonder wish that you could demand your money back from Blockbuster. While they manage to pull off a couple funny jokes, and Rowan Atkinson is of course delightful to watch, most of the time I felt like I was watching like a Fox TV reject trying to keep a 6 year old laughing long enough to spit milk out his nose. Jerry Zucker, what were you thinking? Booger?",Rat Race

It is also my favorite and has my favorite actor ever, Rowan Atkinson, who plays the part of Enrico Pollini.I also liked the Cody brothers, Duane and Blaine, who seemed to get themselves into the strangest predicaments. I liked the twist ending where you think Enrico has won the race, but then you see that he has fallen asleep because he has a rare sleeping disorder. Then they finally catch the money, but they are on stage during Smashmouth's Feed The Earth fund raiser. At first they don't want to give up the money, but when they do, especially the resisting Duane, they feel really good about it and get some rewards too. They all get cool jackets (also, when they stage-dive people actually catch them) and Blaine got a girl who actually has more piercings then him. It all turns out good.",Rat Race

All the actors and actress...Whoopi Goldberg, Seth Green, Jon Lovitz, Dave Thomas, John Cleese and many more...are all incredible in their roles. The movies has constant jokes, with hardly a slow moment in the entire picture. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor, it is easily the funniest movie of the year. The screenplay is the most original and funniest screenplay that's come out in a while. It's nearly impossible to keep such a high energy for the duration of an entire movie, but Rat Race managed to achieve it. Everyone must see this movie, it's great.",Rat Race

333,surfingsimon,"this is a bad, bad, bad film.",1,31 January 2002,"rat race was indeed born of high pedigree, Jerry Zucker directing is always a good thing, John Cleese rarely fails to entertain and coupled with Rowan Atkinson the pair seemed sure to pull off a hilarious feast of laughter.However the film fails to entertain let alone provide laughter. there are two somewhat amusing scenes, one of which is unpredictable the other very predictable. that brings me neatly to my next point, the film is far far too boring and entirely predictable. whilst american pie and others keep the viewer guessing rat race is boring from start to finish. each and every plot twist is obvious upto two or three minutes before its materialisation.the writing - Andrew Breckman I simply don't rate - also lacks in fizz (which for a comedy is never a good thing) and fails to rescue the film. The dialogue is boring mindless and never surprising or amusing. furthermore the scenarios encountered by the characters on their travels are stupid and annoying rather than side splittingly hilarious.Perhaps the ending rescues the film? Er. no. Sorry. The end is 100% cheesy nonsense and is in my opinion the worst part of the film. So really its no t worth waiting for.

Ok, maybe not THAT funny, but I promise you this.. if you do not laugh then you must be dead!

For those of you not familiar with the theme, this movie is about a madcap dash to win $2 million by a group of people who just met. Of the main cast of characters (and characters they definitely are), Rowan Atkinson was, IMHO, the most hilarious.  A pair of brothers provides, arguably, the two funniest scenes in the movie.  One of these scenes involves that cow mentioned in one of the other reviews.  I haven't laughed so hard in years, and give this movie a 9.  Enjoy!",Rat Race

An attempt, presumably, to reproduce the all-star race movies of the 1960s, the result is a smug, tasteless piece of nonsense that ought to be banned under international law. The best thing that could be said about Rowan Atkinson's performance is that it is mercifully short. This is precisely the kind of witless rubbish that gives cinema a bad name.",Rat Race
341,fauxgina,Best comedy I've ever seen!,10,27 November 2001,"Wow, I just got home from seeing the funniest movie I have ever seen: Rat Race.  It is a totally insane flick, full of belly-laughs almost all the way through. I got the giggles more than twice after a few funny scenes that just tickled me pink! One  was when the guy who plays Newman on Seinfeld and Rowan Atkinson were in the Lifeline Medical Services van and Newmie asks Rowan if he wants to see the  human heart he's transporting... Another part is the scene with Jon Lovits at the WWII convention/reunion/whatever that was -- I won't tell you what happens, but be sure this movie will make your mouth drop and I bet you won't be able to contain a hoot of surprise when what you feared would happen actually DOES. If you are in a laugh-out-loud mood, then this is the perfect movie to see. It goes all the way with its comedy without getting unnecessarily disgusting or dangerously close to not being funny. In fact, my uncle and I got back into the  car after seeing it and we must have laughed for five minutes. And I'm not talking silly little giggles -- we absolutely lost it and went completely bonkers. I  feel sorry for people who walked by... Anyway, this is a great movie, with characters who are outrageously intent on getting to that two million dollars and therefore do ANYTHING to get there, a  script that is to DIE for -- it is amazingly well-written -- and a cast that just won't quit. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has any sense of humor whatsoever! By the way, Smash Mouth are a band, not one person -- the lead singer is called Steve and that band is one of the funniest to come out in a long time...Smash  Mouth rule, and judging them on their performances in a movie isn't very fair  since they are, after all,  a BAND and not professional actors.;)",Rat Race

The best thing about it is that no matter what extent of comedy you enjoy, you'll find a likeable character, from the insane antics of the Narcoleptic Italian Enrico Pollini (Rowan Atkinson) to the more down to earth style of Nick Schaffer (Breckin Meyer). Writer Andy Breckman nd director Jerry Zucker have definitely provided us with a potential classic film, it's non-stop flow of verbal and visual gags will have it stuck in your head for days after. Rat Race is only let down by it's ending. It may be as unpredictable as the rest of the film, but it lacks the comedy.

347,kitsune,extremely well written side-splitting comedy,9,13 August 2001,"This is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. The skillful way in which the director sets up one scene and sight gag to flow into the next which is even more unexpected makes this movie enjoyable on various levels. The performances of such a large number of famous actors are all exceptional. It is hard to decide who was the best or the funniest.

348,rezaroo,"Over the top, but in a masterful way",9,25 August 2001,"Although the directing and editing of this film leaves a lot of areas where a film scholar would cringe, the constant heavy fire of jokes and gags compensates nicely.  There's a hint of character development early on for each of the contestants, but just enough for the audience to select their favorites before the string of skits begins and we embark on the plot.There is SO much going on in this film that there's no breathing room, and that's all the better.  You've got six different tracks constantly competing and raising the stakes, as well as 'breather' comic relief from Don Sinclair's million-dollar play-time parties.  There's no part of the movie where you could escape for a bathroom break and miss an incredibly hilarious pay-off.Although the film is over-the-top, that's all part of its charm.  The shock humor works so well that you won't have many problems suspending your disbelief for long enough to laugh in pity at the competitors on screen. In addition, all the different fiascos in the race connect beautifully in ways to jar the audience even more (such as the cow-hanging-off-a-balloon-slamming-into-a-bus-filled-with-I-Love-Lucy-fanati cs-causing-it-to-crash-and-tip-over bit).

The actors were a B-rating at best.  The writing was maybe worth a D.  In fact, it was almost as if the writers knew the wit was depleting because the majority of the movie was bad slapstick and recycled ""I Love Lucy"" humor. Not only are Lucille Ball lookalikes in modern-times not funny, they're obnoxious.The only redeeming qualities were John Cleese, a great Monty Python alum, and Kathy Bates' cameo, which regretfully involved Whoopie Goldberg and was completely revealed in the trailer.

(two of the most brilliant comedies of all time) has failed to capture any of the things that made those movies great.The film is about a group of outrageous people who are racing to get a two-million dollar prize.  The movie has a great cast and it seems like everyone is in it.  John Cleese, Cuba Gooding Jr., Rowan Atkinson and the rest, all do a great job.  They are all funny and quirky, but sadly, the film is not.The are some funny moments, such as when Dave Thomas's character has an interesting request for a prostitute.  You'll also crack up when the cow starts flying.  Most of the time though, you'll only chuckle, and your chuckles will end long before the scene does.  One example of this is when Amy Smart's character tries to taunt and attack her cheating ex-boyfriend while she's flying a helicopter.  It is funny for about half a minute, but after about five minutes of this, you want the scene -and the movie- to end.When you're at your local video story trying to find some suitable movie to rent, avoid this.

What i really liked about this movie is the diversity of the characters. Each and every one of them has their own unique personality to fit perfectly with the story (in which i will not spoil to you). there some lows about this movie, including how the humor gets a little stale towards the end, and the ending was very disappointing, but if you look back before the terrible 10 minute ending you would have in mind a movie that is worth watching.

From the beginning to the end, it's packed full of hilarious scenes and the most unforgettable characters.  It's hard to pick out one scene that made me laugh the hardest (however, I about choked on my Twizzlers in a few scenes in particular *grins*) or one actor who completely stole the lime light.  It was all together amazing!In a rather mad dash for the pretty sum of $2 million bucks, a group of about 10 people race from the regal Las Vegas to Stirling City, New Mexico in a wacked plan put together by one of the richest men in the world.  They go to any and every extent to beat each other to the finish line; and of course, hilarity ensues.The timing is all together perfect and the actors are brilliant!  See it, love it, and laugh your head off as I did.  This is definitely a savior from this summer's movie list, so go see it!  Enjoy :)",Rat Race
363,americanangelx,;),10,31 August 2001,"Rat Race was the funniest movie I've seen, with the best cast.  I would see any movie, no matter how bad with just one of those actors/ress.  There is no way I would miss a movie with Seth Green(America's Sweetheart, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Whoopi Goldberg (Sister Act, Eddie), Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean, Black Adder), John Cleese (Monty Python), Amy Smart, John Luvitz (Newsradio), Cuba Gooding Jr, Breckin Meyer, Smashmouth, and a song written by Orain Hatch (or any political rep. for that matter)!
Even with a sappy ending, no matter how unrealistic (not that any of the movie was realistic) and a sound track of basically All Star (Smashmouth) you still get your money's worth.I doubt anyone could have done a better job acting, of corse allot of it had to do with how willing to act like a idiots the actors were, but nobody seemed to mind that.Personally, my favorite part was when John Luvitz ran threw the wall and on to the stage of the World War II gathering.  Sure, tactless and offensive, but what wasn't.  The only joke that was just to gross to be funny was 'prairie-dogging it'.  Only people who I would say don't see this movie to are people who get offended easily.Ok, even I'll admit it, the plot sucked.  A bunch of people race to Silver City in order to get 2 million dollars.  But with as many jokes and fast-paced action the plot really isn't the big deal you would think it would be.",Rat Race
364,hotpie99,Rat Race is Raucous Fun!!,10,3 August 2001,"Saw an advanced screening of Rat Race and was having a wonderful time from start to finish!The cast is brilliant!  The physical comedy demands of this film could only be masterfully guided by Jerry Zucker.  Nobody does comedy better.  This is the best big commercial film of the summer season.  The trailer doesn't begin to touch on all the great humor.  There is so much zany humor in this film that you will not be disappointed if you're expecting a great comedy. Let's face it, there have been some real dogs this summer.  But with Rat Race: when I left the free screening, I was looking for someone to give my money to!  What a treat.  I plan to see it again with all my friends.
If you want to laugh at a movie that you're supposed to laugh at, then see Rat Race.  You'll have a ball!",Rat Race
365,mgriffm,"An hilarious and welcome return to the Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World!",9,3 August 2001,"Finally! a real comedy this summer!  Granted that this is a remake of the Stanley Kramer classic from the 60's, this is a welcome alternative to teen sex comedies and chick flicks disguised as ""romantic comedies"" neither of which are very funny.  This movie, however, can be described in chat room lingo as a ROTFLMAO movie (Rolling On The Floor Laughing My Ass Off)  There is a little bit of crude humor, a lot of slapstick that actually works (just imagine the cow in ""Twister"" and then get even weirder), not too much bad language, and ""fish out of water"" situations "" (the Barbie museum----I won't give it away, but your sides will hurt because of this part, I guarantee)that gel perfectly into about 100 minutes of non-stop laughter. Veteran comedic actors John Cleese and Jon Lovitz take irony to new levels, and physical comedians like Rowan Atkinson flourish without completely taking over scenes.  So what's it about? Similar to ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", a group of random and very diverse individuals find themselves racing each other to find a fortune in an obscure desert location.  The major differences in the story are that instead of having the money bequeathed by a dying gangster (""mad world's Jimmy Durante), the race is a game set up by casino owner John Cleese, who we learn has set up the contest as a betting forum for international high rollers, who will wager thousands of dollars on anything, including which of the investors will get airsick first......but I digress.  The other major difference is the ending.  In ""mad world"", the principals all ended up in the hospital, bemoaning their fate and regretting their greed.  In this modern gem, the principals all end up together as well, but----Naw, you've just got to see it yourself.  In short, this is THE FUNNIEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, PERHAPS THE LAST FIVE YEARS.  You can bring the kids, or bring a date to this one, you will love it.",Rat Race

After watching it and laughing my head off i realized i would have loved to pay for the movie. In fact i even watched it again the next day.The movie is really funny, and has a lot of funny moments. The previews kinda spoiled a few of the funny gags, but thats what previews are for.The ending wasnt expected at all, and wasnt the best in the world. Then again i think that this is the kinda movie that would be hard to end the right way. So i do give the film makers some credit.overall I'd give it a 8/10",Rat Race

It seems to have been written over several weekend benders, and not edited by anyone prior to release.In spite of an incredibly talented cast, it seems to miss every time a punchline seems to be coming. The cast is not used, instead a lot of fine people simply respond to plot contrivances, which in turn are never developed.So many times good ideas are left to fade while the movie moves on to another deux ex machina which never develops. One example, a bus carrying Lucille Ball lookalikes comes into the race - and instead of a bus-load of I Love Lucy mayhem, they all make Lucy noises, bus has a flat and that's the end of it. That's one example of too many to cite.Rent it off the cheap rack",Rat Race
370,dreamlover,Super hilarious... yet meaningful!,10,26 August 2001,"Before I watched this movie, I know it was going to be very very funny. You've got all-time British comedian Rowan Atkinson, popularly known as ""Mr. Bean"".  You've got Whoopi Goldberg, who has acted in ""Sister Act"" and the sequel.  I do not know the rest of the cast, but they look funny anyway!
This movie is about this owner of a casino-hotel in Las Vegas who was kind of bored, so made a once-in-a-lifetime race, using selected lucky people from the hotel.  Their main task is to get to Silver City to open the locker with US$2,000,000 inside!  All of them went different hilarious and crazy routes to get to Silver City, but ended up giving the money to charity to help the children.  The movie ends off with Smash Mouth performing ""All Star"" live, which was good, because this song is great and I think even the audience feels great about it!I think this movie is worth the money, because of the way that the movie is portrayed.  The movie will never leave you bored at any part because there is something funny and crazy in every part.  Also, this story has a good moral.  The moral of the story is not to be too materialistic about life and not to be too selfish and self-centred and to learn to give readily to the needed.  I think most of us have good lives, but some people out there are suffering and struggling.  The ending really made me think about my life, like the way I spend my money and the way I waste my food sometimes... it really makes you think.Overall, it is one of the most entertaining movie I've seen.  You will be totally entertained by this crazy movie!  Now, that's what I call ENTERTAINMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Rat Race

376,Staid,Very funny film almost ruined by a cheesy sentimental ending.,6,20 September 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This cast has great chemistry and the film carries an interesting yet simplistic plot.  Its a no holds barred race, set up by a wealthy casino owner simply to entertain his high rollers.  As expected this ""no rules"" race is nothing short of hilarious.  The film follows 6 different keys and the parties attached to them, as they race to a locker which contains 2 million dollars.  The highlights include John Lovitz trying to ditch his family while racing to the money and Rowan Atkinson as a foreign narcaleptic.  I was quite pleased with this film, until the last 5 minutes. *I must reveal the ending of the movie to fully explain how bad it is, look away if you don't want to know it*  The film ends with all 6 parties and the 2 million dollars at a Feed the Earth pledge-a-thon.  They arrive there accidentally, each party holding a wad of cash while standing on the main stage.  The pledge-a-thon host ""smash mouth"" lead singer gets the impression that they brought the money to give it to the feed the earth campaign, when in reality they were all trying to take as much as they could and jet. Each party is overcome with guilt as they see the poor children, and one by one they put the money in a sack which is given to feed the earth.  They then dance while smash mouth performs their horrible and redundant ""hit"" song ""all-star""  The movie should have ended with a slow motion view of the parties as they each jetted from the feed the earth campaign and ran for the hills with their money.  This was not a politically correct comedy, it didn't need a sappy politically correct ending.  John Lovitz dancing to smash mouth; ""thats NOT the tickeeeetttt!!!""",Rat Race

A classic comedy in my books and its in my top 10 must see comedies. I recommend it to anyone who likes witty jokes and jackass like stunts. Lots of big time stars makes it hilarious and the movie does a great job of introducing all the characters. My only complaint is the ending gets a little soft. It has a good morale but has a lot less humour in it than the rest of the movie. Also there was room for more romance between characters that could have been displayed better/more humorously.

And it is better than any other comedy I have ever seen for one VERY important reason: when you look back on it, no single actor is funnier than any of the others. This is quite an admission on my part, because I am a big Seth Green fan. But honestly: no one up-stages, and no one disappoints. The fact that every actor has several memorable scenes and quotes I think exemplify the fine film making that was at work here. If you haven't seen it, I won't ruin it for you.

I just re-watched IAMMMMW and I'm certain now that Zucker watched it too. I believe he said, ""Let's make this movie again, with only 1/10 as many huge comedian stars, and with much funnier stunts and twists."" And he succeeded at doing just that.

Not to get off track or anything, but i saw it for the first time in SAP and the narrator read the tittle as ""The world is very very crazy!"" I just laughed. But back to the point. I enjoyed, how zany and wacky this movie was. Unlike other comedy movies, this movie didin't try to be funny, it was funny and it didin't rely on dialog alone for the job. But if there is one thing i would like to complain about is the one character Breckin Meyer played. I cannot let go of it. It's like a pet peeve of mine, to see an actor play so poorly but be a central character. He was not funny, and ""By George"" he cannot act. The movie would be a lot better if he weren't in it.

All the characters are completely different, from the narcoleptic Italian to the guy with the bolt in his tongue. The humor is unique, as it draws from the viewers empathy for the character, as they're put into very uncomfortable situations every couple of minutes. These situations can range from embarrassing to downright terrifying.Like most comedies, the emphasis is on dialog and visuals, not camera angles or the soundtrack, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that the cinematography and sounds aren't worth mentioning. Music isn't too big in this movie, as the only memorable songs are at the beginning intro and at the end of the movie. The camera's show what needs to be shown, and nothing more. Not that that's a bad thing, but it does make the movie seem a little bit flat.All in all, this movie is definitely worth buying, or renting, if you're feeling cautious.

Every character gunning for the money you could relate to in some way at some point in the movie.I haven't seen It's A Mad Mad Mad Mad World and I really don't want to or care to. I don't care if this was a remake because this is a great movie.All of the jokes really played out well and I don't remember any jokes that weren't funny. The ""Barbie"" museum was such an incredibly hilarious joke. One of the best situational comedy moments EVER. I absolutely love Jon Lovitz character in the movie because he is just a regular guy in a dead end job who wants the money and he'll do anything for it. The Hitler joke was such a well played joke, I couldn't stop laughing.Whoopi Goldburg's character and her daughter were probably the least favorite of the bunch gunning for the money but still played a great part in the movie providing some funny jokes. Her ""breaking"" on the bus was so relatable.Rowan Atkinsons character was so incredibly funny. He provided some of the greatest one liners I've seen. ""Look, a drifter, let's kill him."" Had me laughing so hard! I just can't list all of the GREAT moments of this movie. Some people may moan about the ending but it didn't hurt the movie at all, it was a great way to end the movie. The whole movie was pretty fluid through the whole thing and everything made sense. It never really had you asking ""Well, why didn't they do this?"" or ""Why did they do that?"".This goes on my list of the most underrated movies ever right next to Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle and Kung Pow: Enter The Fist.",Rat Race
