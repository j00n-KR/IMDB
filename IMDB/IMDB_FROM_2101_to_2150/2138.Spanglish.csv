0,MartinHafer,Very good but it certainly is not an Adam Sandler comedy.,8,23 January 2010,"It's funny, because when I saw this film advertised, I thought it was an Adam Sandler film. And, while technically is IS since he's one of the stars of the movie, unknown Paz Vega is the star of the film.Paz plays Flor, a Mexican lady who brings her daughter to America for an opportunity for a better life. However, eventually Flor decides that her working two jobs to make ends meet isn't working--especially since her daughter, Cristina, is nearing puberty and she wants to be home evenings with her. So, she leaves the comfort of the Mexican-American neighborhood where she lives and obtains a job as a maid for screwed up folks, the Clasky family.Mrs. Clasky (Téa Leoni) is a self-absorbed and neurotic woman. She is a meddler and seems to care little about personal boundaries or other people's feelings. Her husband (Adam Sandler) is a nice guy who makes great money, but he also never seems to be able to stand up to his domineering wife--and he definitely should as she tends to walk over people. They have two kids--a daughter who is constantly being told by the mother that she needs to lose weight and a son who is practically non-existent in the film.What makes it more difficult for Flor in this seemingly nice but troubled family is that she barely understands a word of English. And, later, when the Claskys rent a summer home in Malibu, they don't even realize that Flor CAN'T move with them because she has a daughter at home--a daughter the Claskys never knew existed! When they learn of her, they invite BOTH to move there with them. This misunderstanding brings to a head the need to get past this language barrier and Flor finally breaks down and buys language CDs and begins to learn English.While you'd think all this would be great, it wasn't. Mrs. Clasky almost immediately acts like Cristina is now her little dress up doll--and soon begins to act like her mother--ignoring Flor's feelings. This brings a lot of tension into the household and ultimately this is not fully resolved, as Mrs. Clasky is simply too self-involved to consider Flor's feelings. However, when misunderstandings occur between Flor and Mr. Clasky, Flor is surprised that he is actually willing to listen and you can see that they begin to forge a friendship.Mrs. Clasky's meddling continues. Now she not only wants to take Cristina places and do things for her, now she wants to send the child to the same prestigious private school that her own kids attend. It's a nice gesture...but not once does Mrs. Clasky ask Flor for permission and she completely undermines her as a parent. The audience at this point clearly hates Mrs. Clasky.The hatred of Mrs. Clasky continues to grow. Not only does she tend to ignore her husband and his emotional needs, she tries to manipulate the daughter to gain weight (thus crushing the kid's self-esteem), take over as Cristina's mother...but she begins cheating on her husband--the man who loves her and gives her everything...except strength. You like Mr. Clasky, but he does seem like a very nice wimp to put up with this prima donna of a wife.When he does learn of her infidelity, he almost immediately runs to Flor for support. You can tell that he's wanted a relationship with Flor for some time but didn't act upon because he's a nice person--too nice to just cheat on his wife--at least until he learned of her infidelity. Somewhat surprisingly, Flor's feelings are the same--she has secretly loved him for some time but did nothing because she didn't want to hurt the marriage. Now that the marriage appeared nearing an end, Flor and Mr. Clasky contemplate taking their relationship to the next level.As you can tell by the plot, this really isn't a comedy and the movie eventually becomes a rather dark film. While this makes the movie pretty sad viewing (particularly if you've been in a marriage that has dissolved), it is interesting because such things can and do happen. And, this makes the film very interesting--and unusual because of its unusual family dynamics. Because of this, the biggest star of this film actually may just be the writing. It poses some interesting moral questions and makes you think about the roles everyone has in this failed marriage--not just the self-absorbed wife but the wimpy husband.Overall, a very interesting film and you probably will enjoy it as long as you are not dead-set on seeing a comedy! Many Adam Sandler fans might be disappointed in this, but I have enjoyed many of his non-comedic and light-comedic roles.",Spanglish
1,TheLittleSongbird,Astute and poignant,9,1 June 2010,"I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed Spanglish. I say that because I do not like Adam Sandler that much, but saying that he has given some likable performances(ie. 50 First Dates and The Wedding Singer). Here in Spanglish he gives a really strong performance, both effortlessly natural and quietly charming. That is not the only good thing about Spanglish though. Sandler is well supported by a strong cast, with Tea Leoni suitably shrill and highly strung as Deborah, Paz Vega gentle and maternal as the Mexican single mother-housekeeper and a wonderful Sarah Steele as Bernice. I also loved Cloris Leachman here, she is a great actress and here she is great as always. The scenery and soundtrack are both magical, the script has a perfect mix of wry laughs and uplifting sentiment, there are a number of poignant moments particularly the contrast between Flor's heart and Deborah's bluntness and the direction is astute. The picture may be a tad too long, but overall Spanglish was just a pleasant surprise. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Spanglish
2,SnoopyStyle,James L Brooks movie is a mix bag of good and less good,6,29 July 2014,"Cristina Moreno adores her mother Flor (Paz Vega) who brought her illegally to California from Mexico. Flor needs a good paying job so that she can keep an eye on her at night. She speaks no English and gets a job as a housekeeper for hyper manic Deborah Clasky (Téa Leoni). Deborah just lost her design job. Evelyn Wright (Cloris Leachman) is her inappropriate hard drinking mother. She has two kids. Her husband John (Adam Sandler) is a top chef. When they move out to the beach for the summer, Deborah pushes Flor to come live with them. It's a struggle between Flor and Deborah over Cristina.Téa Leoni is going insane in this movie. Writer/director James L. Brooks is making her into a cartoon and it's funny for awhile. Adam Sandler is the calm one and that's a good thing. However he's not good enough to be the romantic lead. He struggles to have chemistry with either ladies. The story is a mishmash of broad comedy and heart breaking melodrama. There are some scenes that really don't work. I don't know what happened in that sex scene. It's too stupid to be funny. Other parts work well. It's a formula that Brooks had used before. The movie could work so much better if it could rehabilitated Deborah and left it at that. I do like the ending with the mother and child.",Spanglish
3,Prismark10,Upstairs and Downstairs,6,7 October 2013,"Spanglish is an examination of Latino immigrants to the USA. Particularly one mother and her young daughter who arrive in the USA for a better life and their interaction with a rich American family.The story is essentially told as a flashback with the daughter recounting her experiences with her mother. It is never spelt out whether they came to the USA from Mexico legally or not.After hooking up with a cousin in LA, as the daughter gets older her mother Flor gets a job as a domestic for Tea Leoni and Adam Sandler.Leoni is a neurotic mother. They have two children whilst Sandler is a top chef in a restaurant. Leoni's mother played by Cloris Leachman is an alcoholic but rather wise in her years.Even though she has been in America for several years, Flor has learnt little English and has to communicate via her daughter or others who know Spanish.Flor is beautiful but she was abandoned by her husband hence why she moved to LA.James Brooks of Terms of Endearment fame weaves another comedy drama. He examines the cultural clashes that ensue especially when the Sandler family move to a summer beach house for a few months and Flor comes and lives with them accompanied by her daughter.Paz Vega is very good as Flor, the actors playing the various kids are very good as is Tea Leoni and Leachman.However Sandler in a straight role is weak. He comes across as nice, understanding, almost every man but he is not a strong enough actor to bring the nuances of his character to light.The film signals a budding romance with Paz but it is difficult to buy not helped with last minute re-shoots which changed the ending.Brooks who has shown a sure touch in previous ensemble films such as Broadcast News has maybe let this film meander a bit too much. It needed focus and 20 minutes snipped off.",Spanglish
4,mark.waltz,Her terms of endearment are filled with pride.,7,9 May 2016,"This touching drama with comedy throughout is a view of relationships that build with time, trust and character. Paz Vega is sincere, wide- eyed and curious, yet fearful of stepping out of what she knows as a Mexican lady who struggles with cultural conflicts with raising her bilingual daughter who herself is anxious to mix both of her cultures. As the maid to Tea Leoni, a neurotic Bel Air housewife who takes many liberties with her role as Vega's employer, especially with Vega's daughter, Shelbie Bruce, Vega becomes more important to everyone in the household. As Leoni becomes increasingly difficult, Vega spends more time with Leoni's daughter who teaches her better English and finds herself more involved in her employer's troubles than she wanted to be.Both comical commentary and sage wisdom are offered by Leoni's delightful mother (the scene stealing Cloris Leachman), a former singing star who loves her wine and sees her daughter for the mess she is, often siding with Sandler. Quite subtle for a change, Sandler is more of a reactor, and often it seems like he's dumbfounded by Leoni's often hammy performance. It seems like she's biting off more meat than she can swallow, and tried too hard to keep up with the Oscar winning Cloris. Young Sarah Steele is a nice find as Leoni and Sandler's chubby daughter who strives for typical awkward teen acceptance without becoming cloying.This isn't quite a masterpiece, but it is quite pleasing in spite of Leoni's forced performance and a few deep plot holes. Surprisingly well written and directed by Joseph Brooks, it is a bit of a sleeper and filled with some unpredictable moments. As Sandler and Vega bond, a different kind of love grows, and it becomes very revealing into all of these character's hearts. I didn't see the need however to tell this through flashbacks as it already seemed to be set in modern times and could have just added a prologue to wrap things up.",Spanglish
5,claudio_carvalho,Almost a Great Dramatic-Romantic-Comedy,7,17 January 2006,"""Spanglish"" is almost a great dramatic-romantic-comedy: the first half is excellent, but the situation of infidelity of Deborah Clasky, the character played by Téa Leoni, and the impossible love of Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) for John Clasky (Adam Sandler) simply destroy the good plot.I liked the beginning, with the original application of Cristina Moreno to Princeton; the fight of classes, especially when Cristina goes to a private school and the dilemma of her mother is also a great moment. However, Deborah is quite neurotic, but is a good person, and her character is simply wasted by her infidelity. The declaration of love of Flor to John in the restaurant is also awful, and finishes with any good intention of her character to save the soul of her daughter from the corruption of the upper class world. I do not know why the writer made such stupidity with these unnecessary situations. Anyway, it is always delightful to see the beauty of Paz Vega, from "" Lucía y el Sexo"" and ""El Otro Lado de la Cama"", even in a Hollywood movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Espanglês""",Spanglish
6,kosmasp,Lost in Translation,8,18 May 2007,"Like another reviewer wrote: A good maid is hard to find. That applies to the movie here, too. But then again if you find a good one, like in this instance, should be treated good and tried to be kept! Paz Vega is phenomenal in her role here, also Tea Loni, but the real treat was/is Adam Sandler in this (drama).Anyone who has only seen his comedies, will not have seen this turn happening. He's acting here! But then again he did a great job at Punch Drunk Love, too! So what is he facing up against here? The two beautiful women mentioned before! And although (or more because) one of the them is his wife, this means trouble! And although that would make a great narrative/story by itself, there are other people in the household (i.e. kids) and a friend of the maid, who make up the subplots that just about justify the running time! :o)",Spanglish
7,gavin6942,Good and Bad,5,7 February 2016,"A woman (Paz Vega) and her daughter emigrate from Mexico for a better life in America, where they start working for a family where the patriarch (Adam Sandler) is a newly celebrated chef with an insecure wife (Tea Leoni).The biggest problem with this movie: Tea Leoni is a truly awful actress. But even besides that, as many have pointed out, the word for this film is ""uneven"". There is not a clear plot arc, it wavers from comedy to drama to something else. There was probably a good movie in here, but it gets lost somehow.Adam Sandler takes the lead to some extent, but his acting is just alright. After ""Punch Drunk Love"", we know he can do drama just as well as comedy. But here, he seems like he is always ready to crack a joke and not really fully committed to his serious, fatherly role.",Spanglish
8,lee_eisenberg,"""Spanglish"" offers proof of why militarizing the border won't work",7,16 May 2006,"Adam Sandler takes a slightly more serious role than usual in ""Spanglish"". It portrays Mexican widow Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) and her daughter immigrating to Los Angeles for a better life. Flor gets a job as a housekeeper for wealthy chef John Clasky (Sandler) and his family. Now, although Flor knows that it's not polite to interfere in other people's lives, she can see that John's wife Deborah (Tea Leoni) is not totally fulfilled in life; Flor wonders how long she can ignore the current state of affairs.This movie takes an interesting approach to everything. It seems that James L. Brooks always has interesting ideas as a director, and this is no exception. Maybe it's not a great movie, but pretty eye-opening, especially with the current immigration debate going on. Also starring Cloris Leachman.Bien hecho, todos!",Spanglish
9,jboothmillard,Spanglish,5,23 October 2007,"The critics may give it four stars, I'm sure other people will agree with that, but I have to admit I was expecting more, from writer/director James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, As Good as It Gets). Basically Mexican mother Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) with her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce, also narrating) have emigrated to America, Los Angeles to find a better life. Flor, who speaks no English whatsoever does get a job as a housekeeper for John (Adam Sandler) and Deborah Clasky (Téa Leoni), and for a while her presence is a little questionable of how she understands and obeys, and Cristina is having to translate a lot. Meanwhile, John and Deborah have their quarrels, and their is their is the question of whether they still work, and if they should stay together for their kids. Slowly, Flor learns to speak English with some pricey training programmes and tapes, till eventually she is almost perfect. This is pretty much all the basic info, the rest is almost a blur, and I can't remember why they are chucked out in the end, probably something to do with Flor almost kissing John. Also starring Cloris Leachman as Evelyn Wright, Sarah Steele as Bernice, Ian Hyland as Georgie; Victoria Luna as Cristina, six-years-old and Thomas Haden Church as Mike - Realtor. There are not laughs in it for my liking, too much drama, but it is interesting to see a story of different cultures clashing, and Sandler not playing his usual type of character, e.g. sloppy, dumb. Worth watching!",Spanglish
10,blanche-2,"Touching, warm comedy",8,28 July 2007,"""Spanglish"" is a 2004 film written and directed by James L. Brooks and starring Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni, Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, Shelby Bruce and Sarah Steele. I'm not a particular fan of Adam Sandler movies, and I wonder if I would have picked this up a) had I known he was in it; and b) if someone had not recommended it to me. I'm really glad I didn't know Sandler was in it and happy someone recommended it to me. It is a lovely film with marvelous acting. It contrasts three mothers and daughters - Deborah Clasky (Leoni) and her mother (Leachman); Flor (Vega) and Cristina (Bruce); and Deborah and her daughter (Steele) - while also contrasting the differences between cultures. Flor and Cristina come from Mexico to America after Flor's husband walks out on her. She eventually goes to work for a brilliant chef, John Clasky (Sandler), his wreck of a wife and her alcoholic mother. Deborah is a shallow, insecure, sexually selfish woman; John is sweet but undemanding and passive. Their slightly overweight daughter Bernice is seen for her wonderful qualities by her father, while her mother buys her clothes that are too tight, hoping it will motivate their daughter to lose weight. Deborah takes an interest in Cristina during the summer when Flor and Cristina live in at the family's beach house. She acts presumptuously, taking Cristina shopping, assisting the girl in lying to her mother, and finally arranging for Cristina to go to Bernice's private school. Flor is angered and insulted - not to mention, she's losing Cristina to the American way. Meanwhile, the Clasky marriage is severely on the rocks, and John finds a kindred spirit in Flor.The gorgeous Paz Vega does an excellent job as Flor, speaking only Spanish in the first half of the film; later on she begins to learn English. In real life, Vega speaks no English, which makes her acting even more impressive. Since the film starts with Cristina's letter to a dean of admissions where she talks about the influence her mother has had on her, Bruce narrates the film throughout. She's great as a child who has to straddle two worlds and is attracted to the one with all the expensive stuff. Steele, who plays Bernice, gives us an intelligent girl who is quite adult and observant.The most striking character in the film is Deborah Clasky, and Leoni gives a masterful performance. She's totally believable as a high-strung woman who constantly takes her emotional temperature and causes a lot of disruption in everyone's lives. Boy, you completely forget she's acting. Leachman plays a former jazz singing star who tips the bottle and wasn't there for Deborah as a child. Her acting and comic timing are as strong as ever. ""Low self-esteem for you at this point is just good common sense,"" she tells Deborah. Leachman was 78 when the film was made. Now, at 81, she's been harassing Mel Brooks to let her do her original role in ""Young Frankenstein"" in the stage version, but he doesn't feel she has the stamina. I'm not so sure about that.Sandler, known for comedy, is very effective and likable as John. They say that all good comedians can do drama, but not vice versa. Sandler obviously has a lot of depth because he was able to pull this off well. A talented and sad individual, one hopes John can go on with the burden of his restaurant and family without having a total breakdown and also stand up to Deborah. But we don't know, nor do we know if John and Deborah can stay together even another week.Cultures and classes collide in this very watchable film. Highly recommended.",Spanglish
11,sunwarrior13,Brilliant Comedic Feature,10,4 November 2011,"Spanglish is a comedy drama or a dramedy written and directed by James L. Brooks.The movie is about a Hispanic woman and her young daughter are thrown into the middle of a well-to-do but remarkably dysfunctional family.It stars Adam Sandler,Téa Leoni,Cloris Leachman,Thomas Haden Church and the gorgeous Paz Vega in her first Hollywood feature.Spanglish starts with Cristina Moreno applying to Princeton University. She tells the story of her childhood in her college essay.Flor is a single mother who has struggled to support her daughter Cristina working as a domestic in Mexico. Hoping to give her daughter greater financial security, Flor packs up their belongings and moves the family to California, but Flor refuses to surrender her Latino identity and opts not to learn English; meanwhile, Cristina quickly learns to speak the language fluently. Flor lands a high-paying job working as a housekeeper for Deborah Clasky,who doesn't speak a word of Spanish but this is hardly the most curious thing about their working relationship. A deeply troubled neurotic who has spent time in a mental hospital, Deborah is at once obsessed with her duties as a wife and mother and utterly clueless to her family's needs, and when she learns that Flor has a daughter, she insists that the girl move in with the Claskys. Flor, however, isn't so sure she wants Deborah Americanizing Cristina, especially when Deborah begins doting on the girl at the expense of her relationship with her own daughter, Bernice. Deborah's husband, John, is an oasis of loving calm and understanding in the midst of his chaotic family, and Flor becomes attracted to this man who shows no signs of the arrogant machismo she's accustomed to. But John's career as a chef is turned upside down when The New York Times gives his restaurant a four-star review, suddenly turning his small eatery into ""the"" spot in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Flor reaches the end of her patience when Deborah enrolls Cristina into an exclusive private school which Flor is certain will turn her into a typical American child and drive a wedge between Cristina and her mother.Spanglish is not a masterpiece but it is a brilliant film as it is a heartfelt, funny, sad, human story about what people want and what they should do.Aside from that,it also touches issues about culture's colliding and maintaining their individuality as well as what parents should do for the good of their children. It was a character-driven movie from Flor,played extremely well by the appealing and sexy Spanish actress,Paz Vega and the rest of the cast especially the members of the dysfunctional Clasky family especially Sandler and Leoni.Overall,the pacing of the film was tight and it kept its focus on the characters of the story.Overall,it is a highly recommended movie for everyone who loves sensible comedic features.",Spanglish
12,jotix100,A good maid is hard to find,8,13 November 2005,"Rich people, sometimes, feel guilty about the domestic help they must have to keep their lives in order, which seems to be what's the problem at heart in this story. In fact, some employers like Deborah go to extremes in trying to be nice to a gem she has found in Flor Moreno, the Mexican maid that speaks no English, but who has endeared herself to everyone in the household.Deborah, a high strung neurotic woman, solves all her problems with money. Flor, on the other hand, has her feet well planted on the ground and has to be careful with her money. In fact, the problems between Deb, the employer, and Flor, the maid, come to a head when the family goes to spend their summer at a Malibu rental. It's inconvenient for Flor to go by bus, and because she has a daughter, Cristina, who she will not part with for all the money in the world. Deborah's solution is to invite Cristina, the maid's daughter to come to stay at the beach.James L. Brooks, the writer/director of ""Spanglish"", shows why he is one of the top people working in movies today with this tale about class difference. We are given two strong women, Deborah, who is an unhappy person, and Flor, a woman from another culture, but one with a clear sense of what's right and wrong, with a tremendous sense of who she is and a devotion to her daughter, who she feels is being spoiled by her employer.There's another problem in the Clasky's household. John Clasky, the head of the house is a noted chef who is completely taken for granted by Deborah. John goes along with the situation, but he has no clue as to what his wife has been doing behind his back, getting into an affair with the real estate man. Deborah completely neglects her sensitive daughter Bernice, who is overweight because of the unhappiness in her house. Also, Deborah's mother Evelyn has a drinking problem. Flor, the maid, a woman with limited education, has more common sense in dealing with all the members of the Clasky's household than Deborah.Paz Vega, as Flor Moreno, makes a splash with her portrayal of the maid. In fact, Ms. Vega hardly speaks any English, but one doesn't even seem to notice. It's to Paz Vega's credit, making her American debut, that she steals the film from the stars of the film. This actress makes the viewer root for Flor in her efforts to save her own daughter from the excesses she sees in the Claskys.Tea Leoni plays Deborah Clasky. Ms. Leoni gives a good performance as this confused woman who, in wanting to please her maid, irritates her by exposing young Cristina into things out of her league. Adam Sandler is good also in this more dramatic role that probably his fans will not like, but in fact, it makes perfect sense.Young Sarah Steele is another surprise in the movie. As Berenice, the plump daughter of the Claskys, she promises to have a natural sense about acting. Cloris Leachman is Evelyn, a former jazz singer who drinks too much. Shelbie Bruce is also good as Cristina.""Spanglish"" is worth taking a look into because the situation it presents is real and Mr. Brooks inspired direction and writing.",Spanglish
13,dbborroughs,Doesn't really work thanks to a monster,3,2 January 2005,"I don't really want to dwell on this film so this review will be brief.The film about a collision of cultures when a rich white American family and their Mexican help are forced to spend time together doesn't really work. For me there was something about it that just sort of missed. I would have been happy to give the film a 5 or 6 out of 10 and think it was an interesting misfire except that Tea Leoni's character is so monstrous that I didn't want to be anywhere near her or anywhere I might come in contact with her.Don't get me wrong she's very good at what she does but I hated her so much as a person it completely ruined the movie for me.Its rare that villains and psychopaths in movies make me feel like this, so I find it odd that a housewife in a comedy/drama would.Not for me, or anyone I know.3 out of 10",Spanglish

(Dir: James L. Brooks)Surprisingly hilarious and touching comedy drama from filmmaker Brooks about the cultural and linguistic differences between an affluent Beverly Hills family and their Mexican domestic housekeeper that goes to more levels than anticipated in how (mis)communication can truly be a complication and also an entity all unto itself. Sandler shines in this his finest blend of comedy and drama as the head of the household, a master chef whose marriage is in trouble because his well-meaning yet high-strung/tightly wound control freak wife (Leoni in arguably the most difficult role in the film and in recent film history  a harridan dipped in honey) whose attempts to keep their children well are thwarted by her unwitting off-handed remarks are misinterpreted particularly with the new maid (Vega brimming with soft yet strong sexuality and smarts to boot). Leachman deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod as Leoni's once famous torch singer on the verge of being an alcoholic as her tipsy mother on hand for sage advice. The film is a marvel at excelling in just how families truly are a unit that attempts to survive without one another yet cannot deny just how vital each one is to the other and the emotions run the gamut from the gut-busting, head-shaking in disbelief to the sudden lump-in-the-throat 'there ya goes'; a Hollywood sleeper if there ever was one.",Spanglish
16,anaconda-40658,Sandler's Followup to Punch-Drunk Love.,9,23 March 2016,"Spanglish (2004): Dir: James L. Brooks / Cast: Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni, Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, Shelbie Bruce: Provocative drama about the collision of cultures. Paz Vega plays a native Mexican mother who moves to Los Angeles where she accepts a housekeeping job. Directed by James L. Brooks whose resume sparkles with titles such as Terms of Endearment, As Good As It Gets and Broadcast News. Structure is faltered with disjointed material that is not capitalized upon. Adam Sandler is excellent running a restaurant while his wife has an affair. Tea Leoni plays his energetic yet overbearing wife. Paz Vega steals the film while her daughter translates her native language as well as teach herself. She is also overprotective when it seems that Leoni is spending more time with her daughter. She also plays a part in Sandler letting his guard down when they confide in each other thus drawing closer than intended. Cloris Leachman plays Leoni's alcoholic mother whose wisdom comes from allowing her daughter to learn from her mistakes. Her role could have easily been reduced to a prop had it not been for a few great scenes particularly between herself and Leoni. Shelbie Bruce plays Vega's daughter who becomes influenced by these new people in the life of her mother, and their children. Compelling theme regarding culture and translation.

17,gradyharp,A Mismarketed and Mislabeled Film That is Surprisingly Good!,8,17 April 2005,"When movie trailers come out months before the release of a film and movie billboards crowd the malls and other places trying to convince the public of what to expect (read 'how can we guarantee making the most money from the biggest crowd?'), it is difficult to get motivated to step over the hype and decide for yourself the merits and message of a little movie.SPANGLISH used slapstick approach, beginning with focus on Adam Sandler of the superfluff/toilet mouth 'comedy' genre, to publicize this little story into a COMEDY. That was enough to keep this viewer out of the theater. But seeing James L. Brooks current opus at home without all the hoopla of the theater crowd resulted in a pleasant discovery: this is a well-written little drama, peppered with some comedy, that addresses a lot of issues about parenting, cross-ethnicity, living your dream vs skimming off the top, having loyalty to the inner self, the desperate need for communication in today's loud world, alcoholism, etc. Not the stuff for slapstick, nor is it treated that way.John Clasky (Adam Sandler in a straight role that allows him to show substance over pratt falls) is a successful chef who is able to support his family with a home in Beverly Hills and a summer home at the beach (obviously Malibu). His wife Deborah (Tea Leoni in a wildly dysfunctional mother role which she handles well), in desperation for breathing room to pursue her lackluster life, hires a non-English speaking Latina maid Flor (Paz Vega) who has immigrated to the US with her young daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce, a amazingly bilingual young actress) to make a life for herself after her husband has left her. Deborah's daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) is overweight and the victim of her mother's misconstrued attempts to correct her problem at the expense of acknowledging Bernice's self worth.Though busy with his successful restaurant, John finds time to be a loving father, a husband who is as supportive of his wild wife as is possible, and who gradually finds in the new Flor a gentle, honest, compassionate/passionate human being that seems to be a soul mate. Things progress quickly: Flor learns English via language tapes on TV, Cristina moves in with the family when the move to Malibu occurs, Deborah dotes on the bright, attractive Cristina while ignoring her own daughter, Flor tends to the emotions of Bernice, and finally a marital crisis occurs which places into focus the idiosyncrasies of all members of the extended household (including Deborah's alcoholic mother - Cloris Leachman, as brilliant as ever).The manner in which Brooks brings this chaos to closure does not sell out the way most stories do: there are no pat answers here but altered individual perceptions are suggested and we are given the opportunity to resolve them as we wish. Is this a comedy? No, though there are many cleverly funny lines and situations. This is a pertinent drama, unfortunately mislabeled in name and in media approach. For this reviewer this is a tender film about family needs and personal goals. The cast is excellent, each member taking risks that prove to be successful. Give it a try!",Spanglish
18,zetes,"Far from perfect, but somehow perfectly satisfying",9,11 April 2005,"The story involves a Mexican woman (Paz Vega) becoming the maid for a dysfunctional, wealthy white family. Other characters include the white family's son and daughter, the grandma, and the maid's own daughter. The plot is very loose, and is more an excuse for well developed characters to interact in complex situations. The film balances its comedy and drama pretty much perfectly. The biggest complaint is that Téa Leoni's character, the wife and mother, is far too psychologically messed up, and maybe even that Leoni overplays it (by a country mile). But I did like the character, at least the intentions that Brooks had for her. It's interesting that you have a kind of distaste for her, but can also sympathize. Adam Sandler plays her husband and gives his finest performance yet. Like Paul Thomas Anderson before him, Brooks really knows how to find a perfect character for Sandler to play. Paz Vega is great. She has previously starred in films by Almodóvar and Medem. I am a bit disappointed to discover that she's Spanish and not Hispanic. The film is intentionally aimed at a segment of the white population that hasn't quite gotten used to the fact that America's Hispanic population is not going away, and it would have been nice to have an actual Mexican to play the part. Shelbie Bruce is excellent as Vega's daughter. She's far better than the two white children. Speaking of the white children, they're another of the disappointing aspects of the film, as they are given stories and characters but then forgotten amidst the other characters' problems. I can probably pick out a dozen more flaws, some of them major, but the strong characters and excellent dialogue work so well that I enjoyed it completely.",Spanglish
19,Sylviastel,Not as Bad As It Looked!,8,1 March 2009,"Spanglish was a surprise because the commercials on television made it look so unappealing when it has a first rate cast and maybe a second rate script. The stars include Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni, and the always fabulous Cloris Leachman. The characters in this clash of cultures and classes are about the wealthy Los Angelenos who live in the canyon and the mother and daughter immigrants from Mexico. While the wife played by Leoni tries to help the daughter and treats her as almost as if she was her own is resented by her own mother. The Spanish daughter has gone from translator because her mother doesn't speak English enough to being between two worlds where she excels in a private school on scholarship thanks to Leoni's character and befriends their lonely daughter. She becomes one of the family much to the resentment of her own mother who opts out of the environment. I thought this film was a lot better than the commercials I saw for it. Cloris always shines through in her role.",Spanglish
20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Spanglish,9,2 April 2005,"I admire filmmakers who manage to explore powerful relationships and character development in a tight two hours, and Spanglish falls into this category perfectly.As the name goes, ""Spanglish"" is a combination of two words - Spanish and English, and is one of the major themes covered in this film, which is the clash of cultures, and the fear of dilution of cultural values. Paz Vega plays Mexican (illegal) immigrant housekeeper Flor, to an All American family, Mr and Mrs Clasky, played by Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. They have 2 children Bernice and Georgie, and live with Tea's mother in a rich suburb. All seems well at first, but cracks start to appear as the story develops, as Paz discovers during the course of her work. The father is self deprecating as he is easy going, the mother is neurotic most times and imposes her wishes on the children (especially the chubby daughter, whom she thinks must lose weight), the daughter upset with her mum for that expectation of her, a son who sings his grandmother's jazz oldies, and an alcoholic grandmother.A large part of the narrative takes place during the summer home, with major character development and relationships take over as the center-stage in this film. It is natural that the interactions between the characters develop from what it was in the beginning, to what it is at the end. Some turn for the better, while others just couldn't be. The importance of family and family values are explored. I will attempt to dissect the major relationships: John and Deborah Clasky: As husband and wife, it seems that their relationship isn't that good to begin with. With his easy going nature, John tends to give in to Deborah on a lot of things. Deborah expects her husband to not be the ""good guy"" to the kids, but to be in agreement with her on issues she deems as important and in her opinion, correct for the kids. Their relationship gets put to the test when one of the commits adultery, while the other is unwittingly being tempted into his own.John and Flor: As employer employee, they develop mutual respect for one another when they realize that they share similar values. To communicate with John, she takes up self-study English lessons, and their friendship progressed to mutual liking. They share the same parental anxiety and have frequent honest conversation expressing their thoughts. However, they develop feelings for each other, and find difficulty on where to draw the line between their ever increasing desire to be close. When the line is crossed, do you call it quits because it's the correct thing to do? The last 30 minutes of the film is tinged with sweetness from this blossoming romance which couldn't develop further by virtue of principles. You are left wondering, what if? Deborah and Cristina, Flor's daughter: When Deborah entices and unwittingly seduces Cristina into the all American lifestyle, so much so as even lying to her mum. Deborah is taken to Cristina because she is what her daughter could probably never be - smart, thin and beautiful. Cristina, on the other hand, enjoys Deboarh's company and attention because, hey, it's the American Dream, no? Flor and Cristina: The movie is narrated by Cristina, from the time when she was little and her father walks out of the home, the hardships that mother and daughter endured through their journey to the USA, and her understanding of her mother's hardship with work to bring her up singlehandedly. Flor is understandably protective of her daughter's wellbeing, and especially in teacher her correct values and her heritage. She becomes jealous when Deborah, in her eyes, start to become more important to her daughter, and sometimes envious of the material wealth that Deborah showers on Cristina that Flor can never ever provide for. Flor fears that her child will be ""hijacked"" by Deborah.Deborah and her daughter Bernice: Her daughter at times resents the attention that her mum is giving Cristina, as she knows that she could never be thin as expected by mum. She has fears comparisons.Bernice and Flor: Flor starts off as work being strictly work, and no intervention into the family affairs. But she felt compelled to help when Bernice feels upset when Deborah subconsciously puts her down, most of the time subtle digs at her weight. Flor becomes Bernice's confidante in that sense, and John points out to her the hypocritical ways in which she disallows Deborah to treat her own daughter Cristina in similar ways. That scene between John, Flor and Cristina is comedic at times, but powerful nonetheless.Other relationships too long for this review to cover, and also they are quite minor, but at the end of the show, most relationships stay intact because blood runs thicker than water.The main casts excelled in their performance, but I like to single out Adam Sandler. He has demonstrated that he is capable and comfortable doing drama, instead of the madcap comedic characters we associate him with. I hope he does films of different genres to highlight his capability as a serious actor. Also catching my attention in a cameo is Sideways' Thomas Haden Church.This is a touching drama with an ending that some might deem as heart-wrenching, but I highly recommend this film.",Spanglish
21,StevePulaski,Combines two words and two formulas with unsuccessful results,5,23 August 2012,"There is a sweetness to James L. Brooks's Spanglish, although I am unable to locate it due to a number of unhealthy distractions the film employs. Here is a wholesome, yet relatively bland film that feels good-natured and uplifting because of its message and spirit, at the same time mechanical and unmoving because of its execution.The story begins on the strangely uninspired note of Princeton deans scrounging through letters sent by optimistic young freshman. The essays focus on the topic of ""who I admire most."" One dean stumbles upon Cristina Moren's piece which is a long and apparently rambling ode to her mother and how she shaped her as a strong and compassionate women. We then begin the long and rambling flashback.We see Cristina's mother was a woman by the name of Flor (Paz Vega), who immigrated from Mexico to L.A. to work for the rambunctious Clasky family. She was a kind and gentle woman, but one who carried her limited English and stereotype with her as an albatross. She quickly meets the entire gang; the stressed out but laidback chef John (Adam Sandler), the manic drama queen Deborah (Tea Leoni), the emotional Bernice (Sarah Steele), and the mostly absent Georgie (Ian Hayland).The film centers around the kind of impact Flor and, eventually, her daughter Cristina had around the Clasky's life. From the first moment, she seems to connect with John, but finds him a bit soft and unmanly. John and Flor guiltily spend time together, while Deborah is busy cheating on him with one of her coworkers.Spanglish is a very actory film and that doesn't truly help matters. At times it seems to distractingly show us how pretty the film's actors look when they're all dressed up, but struggles to find things to do with them. Sometimes, the screenplay feels like it's on autopilot, including one incredibly awkward, unnecessary sex scene involving Deborah roughly plowing Jack with intimacy leading her to achieving orgasm before sex has even started. Scenes like that seem to derail the light-hearted and dramatic nature the film wants to pleasantly fit into, and, for once, I can not blame Sandler for doing so.Beneath the mediocre movie that is stuffed with lackluster romanticism and corniness is a welcomed parable of a Mexican immigrant who overcomes odds and inequality, successfully adapts as a fish out of water, learns English, and achieves the happiness everyone deserves in life. If only Brooks spent more time exercising that than his ability to craft ridiculous scenes creating an uneven, unfocused narrative.I grew weary many times during Spanglish for several reasons. Primarily for its suffocating sentiment or lack thereof and its issues that are so much larger than its characters ever were (the film ironically gives a story that is loosely about overcoming a stereotype, yet adds one at almost every turn), and not to mention, the film's list of characters it wants to develop but inevitably makes cookie-cutter stereotypes out of almost all of them. We are told at the end of the film by Flor that Georgie is a very sweet boy. How, we don't know, but apparently, during the times we didn't see him, he was sweet. Props to Sandler for, once again, venturing out of his comfort zone, but the material surrounding him overshadows the character study the film wants to create with shallow archetypes of people.Starring: Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni, Paz Vega, Sarah Steele, and Ian Hayland. Directed by: James L. Brooks.",Spanglish
22,=G=,"Fresh, funny, and warm.",8,16 April 2005,"""Spanglish"" tells of a beautiful Mexican woman and her daughter who enter the US ""economy class"" and take up residence with a family of five including Dad (Sandler), Mom (Leoni), two kids and a mother-in-law. What ensues is a funny and romantic coming together of Spanish speaking and English speaking people as they cope with a variety of personal issues which go well beyond their clash of languages. From the pen of James Brooks who gave us ""Terms of Endearment"", ""As Good as it Gets"" , and many more good films, ""Spanglish"" is a creative, fresh, and warmhearted little film with moment-to-moment unpredictability. Ho-hummed by the critics but appreciated by the public, ""Spanglish"" should have broad appeal and make for a pleasant diversion for anyone in the mood for some upbeat summadis and summadat entertainment. (B+)",Spanglish
23,Buddy-51,not another cookie-cutter comedy,7,31 December 2005,"I must admit that it took a little while for ""Spanglish"" to completely win me over - but win me over it did thanks to its sharply observed social commentary and winning performances by a first-rate cast. At first, the film threatens to be swept away by a tidal wave of stereotypical characters and clichés, but it doesn't take long for the subtleties and complexities to kick in and to lift the movie to a higher level.This is James L. Brooks' witty take on the cultural divide that separates the ""master class"" from the ""servant class,"" in multi-ethnic Los Angeles. The Hispanic side of the equation is represented by Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a gorgeous single mother living in Mexico who heads to America to start a new life for herself and her daughter. Eventually, despite the fact that she cannot speak English, Flor finds a job as a fulltime housekeeper and nanny for a wealthy white family named the Claskys. The wife, Deborah (Tea Leoni), is a deeply neurotic limousine liberal who drives her family crazy with her obsessive compulsiveness and lack of a clear mental focus. Her husband, John, is a mild-mannered master chef who has become completely exasperated by the intensely mercurial nature of his wife's behavior and moods, and who yearns for nothing more than a little peace and harmony on the home front. The Claskys also have a sweet-tempered but homely daughter, Bernice, who bonds with Flor's beautiful daughter, Christina, who narrates the tale.What distinguishes ""Spanglish"" from so many other American comedies is its staunch refusal to adhere to a cookie-cutter formula. Brooks has written a screenplay that allows the characters room to breathe and to interact with one another in complex and surprising ways. He doesn't even feel the need to tie up all the loose ends in the closing minutes. He is perfectly willing to let the characters continue to live their lives even after the closing credits have scrolled by. What he captures best is the subtle tug-of-war that develops between the two mothers over their respective daughters, particularly Deborah's intense devotion to Christina, which seems partly a result of a genuine desire to help her get ahead in life, and partly an unconscious preference for this beautiful child over her own overweight daughter. Brooks understands the sore spots inherent in parent/child interactions as well as relationships in general. Naturally, a romantic attraction eventually develops between John and Flor, but one that is handled with charm, delicacy and tact.Sandler and Vega give warmth, touching performances, and Shelbie Bruce, Sarah Steele and Cloris Leachman offer superb support. Leoni starts off so over-the-top that one fears she will throw the entire movie off-kilter. But damned if she doesn't grow on you, as she turns what could have been a psychological gargoyle into a sympathetic woman filled with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt.Happily, the humor in the film arises naturally from the characters and situations and almost never feels desperate or forced. And, indeed, there are some very hearty laughs generously laced throughout the movie.""Spanglish' doesn't try to ""solve"" the ethnic and race relations problems that still plague America's largest cities. However, in its own quiet, humor-filled way, it reminds us that the caste system is still very much a reality in a country that prides itself on its supposed lack of class-consciousness.",Spanglish
24,Robert_duder,Something a little different,9,10 April 2005,"Although pushed as a comedy I wouldn't quite call Spanglish your run of the mill comedy. Perhaps it's a comedy in the same way Sideways or other dark looks into the human mind and emotions can be considered. Brilliant director/film maker James L Brooks uses a deep understand of what horrifies us about ourselves in order to make us laugh in a kind of embarrassing, scary chuckle. He did it so brilliantly in As Good As It Gets giving us over the top characters that are so deviantly good at being neurotic. He brings the same style, but toned down, that he has brought to The Simpsons for so many years.Spanglish is the story of a well off family, the Claskys, who seem to have it all together, a brilliant chef, an upper class wife, and a smart, privately schooled daughter. A Mexican woman moves her daughter from lower class Mexico to the United States after her husband leaves her. She is trying to raise her daughter to be strong and independent and give her the world's best opportunities. The Mexican woman takes a job as the Clasky's housekeeper and finds herself in the middle of what turns out to be NOT the all together family. The husband and wife are a complete mess, the wife is overbearing, emotionally distraught, and unknowingly abusive to her daughter and husband. The husband is someone who wants to stay low key and never succeed and doesn't believe he deserves to be happy and the daughter who is free spirited and happy but is quickly being overburdened by her mother. The Mexican woman tries hard not to interfere but she sees in this family everything she wants to fix and she tries. She feels sad and sorry for John Clasky, and also resents Deborah Clasky who tries to take her daughter and use her to replace her own daughter. Despite Flor's attempt at saving the family it becomes too much and she realizes if she truly wants to give her daughter the most she must leave them.I am quite shocked at the horrible reviews I have read of this film. Granted it was being hyped as a little more mainstream than what it is because in fact this is a very artsy film with much hidden message and social commentary. The constant blathering I read about Tea Leoni's character makes me realize how few people actually got this film or get James L. Brook's film making style at all. You ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO LIKE Deborah Clasky. She's a mess, she's abusive, she's not in control, she's insensitive, and selfish and everyone seems shocked that they didn't like her character??? Leoni was brilliant in her role, she didn't hesitate to make her character despicable and unlikeable. I don't think people realize how many people there are out there like her. Adam Sandler continues to prove he's much more than a slapstick comedy fare. He does a great job as the quiet John Clasky who thinks he's fallen in love with the tender, loving personality of Flor. Flor who sees in John a man who she so badly wants to save from a woman she resents and can't stand. The two are NOT in love but rather in love with the idea of what the other represents. Cloris Leachman who plays a supporting role as the alcoholic mother of Leoni's character is wonderful as the quieter insanity in the film. She balances the abnormality out by being abnormal to a more normal extent...again proof of Brooks' brilliance. Spanglish is just so intelligent and deeply thought provoking and done with such care and consideration to the plot of the film. Spanglish explains the language barrier between the family and the Mexican woman but not only that it shows us the language barrier is not so complex as the emotional barriers between their own family. Even when the language barrier is gone it only makes things more complex rather than simplifying things. There are no Spanish subtitles in the film when Spanish is being spoke because Brooks wants us to feel the barrier. That's what this film is all about. A lack of showing at the Academy Awards for a film like this boggles my mind because it is just such an intelligent film and if you want to be provoked intellectually, fall in love, and just feel such a range of emotions, definitely check out Spanglish. Newcomer Paz Vega as Flor is wonderfully together and protective of her family. A great movie!! 9/10",Spanglish
25,MLDinTN,"Bland, too long",5,15 November 2005,"This was not your typical Adam Sandler film. Actually, he isn't the star in this. It features Tea Leoni and Paz Vega. A girl narrates the story of how her mother came to America and got a housekeeping job with a wealthy family. Her mom, Flora, only speaks Spanish in the beginning, but is still hired by the Clasky's. Deb is a nut who wants to be her daughter's, Christina, new best friend. She nags her own daughter, Bernie, because she is over weight. Christina is pretty and thin and she can't wait to buy things for her. Flora disapproves. John is a famous chef who puts up with his wife's crazy antics. He doesn't seem to be very happy. Flora senses things aren't great with this family and does interfere some.Soon, Deb rents a house for the summer and gets Flora and her daughter to stay with them. Deb is always out at night, and you can figure out what she is probably doing. Toward the end there is a big blow up between Deb and John when the truth comes out. Then John's reaction is kind of weird. But, you know he'll come back home. Finally, Flora decides she can't work for the family any more. The end. Not a great ending.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but is 30 minutes too long. The ending just happens, I didn't think it was much of a conclusion to the film. Plus, the plot isn't that entertaining to begin with. And this is strictly a drama, no comedy from Sandler.",Spanglish
26,g-bodyl,A Story About Human Emotions!,9,10 May 2014,"Spanglish is a very heartfelt, engaging film and I'm pleased to announce that the film is better than I expected. It's a story about how humans connect with themselves and with each other emotionally. This is a smart comedy that has a keen eye for comedic timing. I'm surprised how emotional and heartfelt this film is because I really cared about each character here.James L. Brook's film is about how two cultures can join together as one. In this sharply-written dramedy, a Hispanic woman and her daughter moved to America in search of a better life. Flor gets a job as a maid for the dysfunctional Clasky family.The acting is really good thanks to many wonderful performances. This is one of Adam Sandler's earliest dramatic roles. When he puts his heart and mind to the task, he can be a very good actor as shown here. He's still funny and sweet, but more serious. Tea Leoni is solid as the neurotic wife and her bed scene with Sandler is one of the best scenes in the film. Paz Vega shines as Flor and Cloris Leachman is so good and has the best dialog of the film.Overall, Spanglish is a much better film than I anticipated. The story is a tale of emotions and how people interact with them. It's a sharply-written film and it delivers well on the laughs and tears. It's a little bit on the long side, but I doubt people will notice with such a moving story. I rate this film 9/10.",Spanglish

Adam Sandler is fantastic here, he proved he can play a serious role here, he gave an awesome performance, had great chemistry with Tea Leoni and Paz Vega, and was extremely likable!. Téa Leoni is beautiful, and is excellent here, i felt like slapping her sometimes since she was always so uptight but that was her character, and she played it extremely well. Paz Vega is outstanding here, she gives a phenomenal performance, had great chemistry with Sandler, was very likable, and i felt sorry for her character, i thought she did a phenomenal job!, she is also STUNNINGLY GORGEOUS!. Cloris Leachman is great as the alcoholic mother, and added a lot of class to the film. Shelbie Bruce is awesome as the daughter, and the way she translated was utterly amazing, she is one of the best child actors i have seen.

29,atlasmb,Strong Performances Elevate This Film,7,29 January 2021,"This is a story about an undocumented Mexican woman named Flor (Paz Vega) who moves to the U.S. with her daughter. The story is told via flashback, through voice over by the daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), who wants to attend a prestigious university.As one might expect, there is a culture clash between Flor and the white family that employs her services for household help--especially as personified by Deborah (Tea Leoni), the mother. It should be noted that Leoni and the entire cast give fantastic performances, even if some of the portrayals are written as caricatures. Adam Sandler, who plays the father, John, is particularly fun to watch, because he mostly plays his character straight, without his usual comedic embellishments. I was most impressed by Sarah Steele, who plays the teenage daughter of Leoni and Sandler.Much of the story is intended to be comedy, though it deals with social issues that go well beyond the disconnect caused by the fact that the two mothers do not speak a common language. The film has a definite perspective about the various cultural issues it addresses, but it is only partially convincing in its arguments.I found the film to be disjointed, but that did not bother me.

31,Floated2,Different side of Sandler,8,16 August 2016,"Spanglish, a 2004 film starring Adam Sandler, which is directed and written by James L Brooks. The film is quite a different take and departure from typical Adam Sandler starring films, and reason is because he did not have his typical Happy Madison Production on this film. Where as Spanglish is more of a serious film which centers towards more morals and serious issues as well as described as a drama- comedy. Though the film has a lot of moments of emotion that have no heft but don't offend either, countered by instances of impressive cleverness. Much like the melodrama and humor play off each other, the movie's less-than-cogent politics are almost like a foil for the charming performances and highly amusing script. Nobody's perfect. The cast is all great, and Paz Vega is completely likable as Flor (A woman turned maid coming to America), as she steals the scenes she is in and is convincing in her tough role. The film is well written, well acted and the cast all deliver well. The film is quite underrated in some regards, though is rarely mentioned among Sandler's ""best films"" list, and a reason could be, is that Spanglish is quite a different film compared to his other comedies.",Spanglish
32,insomniac_rod,Regular expectations.,6,17 May 2009,"To be completely honest, I only watched this movie because Paz Vega looked extremely hot, sexy and all positive adjectives towards her beauty.Me as a Latin American, found the movie to be extremely clichcéd although I knew the plot.The fact that a Spanish woman (wrongly labeled as Latin American but whatever) is new in town doesn't means she's looking for a love interest, and that she cannot find another job besides a housemaid. Still, I thought: ""It's only a movie so I should only enjoy and keep my brains far from it"".The truth is that as a romantic comedy the movie works pretty well. The situations are somehow funny when it comes with Paz Vega's character. She's funny, smart and with a big temper. Adam Sandler does what he can and delivers a credible performance. The chemistry between them in my opinion is absent and a love story wasn't necessary but it's Hollywood. Also, why would other men think that Paz is an easy woman? Like in the cafeteria scene.What I liked about the movie was the character development of Vega's.Watch this movie if you wanna get lucky with your girlfriend or if you are attracted to Paz Vega.

Adam Sandler's character as the dad is just treading water throughout the deranged females in his life. I liked Sandler in this semi-serious role -which I haven't been able to say about him too much lately. His character shows depth and I loved the interactions with his daughter.Téa Leoni is also excellent, really putting the crazy in dysfunctional and super fun to watch. Her character is a disparaging mess and does some terribly selfish things but you can't seem to hate her for it. Cloris Leachman provides a lot of laughs in a background sort of role as her Leoni's alcoholic-ish mother.The story pretty much revolves around Paz Vega, who is (beautiful)& scene stealing as a Mexican maid who tries to make a better life for herself and her daughter by taking a job with an affluent L.A couple.The movie isn't perfect and does waffle a bit, especially towards the end when love is introduced to the storyline. 5/18/15",Spanglish
34,noralee,Suburban Male Fantasy,6,4 January 2005,"There's much right with ""Spanglish,"" but one is left too much with the impression of a modern male fantasy flick.It's a cri de coeur from a guy -- hey, you wanted us to be sensitive, a good provider, successful but not obsessively so, organize our career to spend more time with the family, encourage you to have time to stay in shape and you're still not satisfied? And, of course, throw in a sexy Latina who shares his values as temptation to test his vows.As Téa Leoni says from practically the start, she's set up as ""the bad guy"" to Adam Sandler's ""good guy"" who is just about perfect and beloved by all. Sandler's character is so self-effacingly nice that when he hears a four-star review of his restaurant he focuses on praising how his daughter read it aloud, let alone self-sacrificing in his romances. I know I was supposed to be more sympathetic to him when his wife's exuberant congratulatory lovemaking pleasures only her and doesn't complete him, but after gazillion movies with the reverse I thought it was actually about cinematic time.There's only passing explanations as to why she's so competitive and virtually a monster to her daughter, husband and housekeeper -- she got laid off from her job, her self-centered, unmaternal, live-in mother is an alcoholic-- let alone only a throwaway comment that they were high school sweethearts as to why they are even couple at all. The mother/daughter insensitivity here is on the par with conflicts in ""Thirteen"" or ""Tumbleweeds"" in being almost as vicious as the male/female fights in ""Closer."" Dropped into this volatile mix is Paz Vega as a housekeeper who is not only a perfect mother but so beautiful, as Sandler's character says ""You should be a separate gender."" The voice-over by her daughter gets annoying and frequently says the obvious, but the cross-cultural class conflicts bring out the most interesting dialogs in the film as characters struggle to honestly explain themselves within communication barriers, particularly about parenting. These luminous speeches are undercut by awkward pacing as the audience is jostled from physical comedy to pathos. There is wonderful poignancy and laughter where the daughter is translating serious and passionate adult conversations and Shelbie Bruce is both funny and moving as the daughter in these scenes.There is unusually frank honesty about privacy, financial and family issues for employer/employee in the intimacy of a household. There are a few confusing time line issues as the school year and vacation calendar isn't completely consistent.The production design is excellent, though the physical surroundings that can be bought by a successful chef are visually staggering.The current musical song selections are excellent and unobtrusive, though there's not much to reinforce that Cloris Leachman's grandmother is a former chanteuse.The effusive score emphasizes the treacly elements.",Spanglish
35,EUyeshima,High-Minded Two-Pronged Story Causes a Brooks Misfire,3,14 December 2005,"What an utter disappointment. From James L. Brooks, the man who made ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Broadcast News"", ""As Good As It Gets"" and of course, ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", comes a dramedy that has two separate agendas that the filmmaker seems intent on integrating regardless of the resulting contrivances. The first is to show the plight of Mexican immigrants in their effort to realize economic betterment while concurrently maintaining their cultural identity. This part is worthy of screen treatment. The second is to show the underbelly of the liberal mindset and the seemingly rampant dysfunctional state of the family unit among the L.A. social elite. This part has been seriously misjudged.Let me tackle the problematic second part first. In an overly sincere mode, Adam Sandler portrays John Clasky, the hottest chef in a city where culinary celebrities are at the top of the heap. His professional life seems to be modeled after master chef Thomas Keller, who was exalted in the same way by food critics when he opened his ""French Laundry"" restaurant in Yountville (which is indeed fantastic). In fact, Keller appears in a pertinent extra on the making of the ideal late night sandwich, which includes the recipe as well. The challenge in accepting Sandler's performance is not his attempt to be taken seriously as Oscar-bait, but rather his apparently limited ability to convey the complexity underneath what seems to be the perfect man - understanding, compassionate (though too passive at key moments of conflict), a loving father. At this stage in his career, especially with his idiosyncratic tics (slurring his words, constant stooping, stumbling about), Sandler is simply not yet substantive enough an actor to pull off such a multi-dimensional role.But the real problem is the way Brooks conceives John's wife Deborah as a character. Téa Leoni has the unfortunate task of playing the aerobicized fishwife from hell, a former go-getter who was downsized out of her career as a commercial designer. Now Deborah is a horrifying mother who chokes the self-esteem out of her daughter (as much as it is inferred her mother did to her) and shamelessly pilfers the affections of her maid's daughter. She's a therapy-driven narcissist whose competitive impulses get in the way of any good intentions, and she's always apologizing for her actions, which Brooks hopes will endear her to us. It just doesn't work because Leoni, despite her obvious talent and beauty, is not likable enough for us to care - Deborah is among the most exhausting, disreputable characters I have seen in a movie in ages (and that includes Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling in the documentary, ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room""). The combination of Sandler and Leoni nearly torpedoes the movie completely.This leaves us with the movie's first agenda item, the fearful assimilation of immigrant Latinos. Brooks has found a luminous actress in Paz Vega, a Penelope Cruz look-alike (imagine the Almodóvar possibilities in their joint casting), as Flor, the woman who escapes Mexico with her daughter to eventually find work as the Clasky maid. Vega injects a nice quality into Flor that is at once unselfish and proud, as Flor exhibits true backbone to her employers. The character, however, is idealized at the expense of presenting a figure as complex as the Claskys, especially as the story veers into the inevitable though not terribly credible attraction that develops between Flor and John. In fact, her innate nobility provides the framework for the story as it is essentially a flashback described by her daughter Cristina in what must have been the world's longest application essay to Princeton. In the end, we are expected to believe that Flor is too virtuous to have any personal desires, though there is still something resolutely selfish about pulling her daughter out of the scholarship-funded private school.Shelbie Bruce is excellent as the adolescent Cristina, especially as she cross-translates John's and Flor's argument and in a moment of unfiltered anger near the end. Sarah Steele is equally fine as the Clasky's overweight daughter Bernie, alternating between smart-mouth comments and palpable sadness. And finally in a good role again, Cloris Leachman displays her considerable skill in playing Deborah's alcoholic though self-aware mother, Evelyn, who tosses the best line to her daughter: ""Your low self-esteem is simple common sense, dear."" I only wish her character was fleshed out more to provide a better counterbalance to her awful daughter. Brooks should be commended for his high-mindedness here but docked for his hubris in having us accept these characters. The DVD has lots of extras, including enthusiastic audio commentary from Brooks with his editors Richard Marks and Tia Nolan and the addition of twelve deleted scenes again with the same trio providing comments. There is the brief Keller clip I mentioned, as well as an HBO First Look featurette that actually got me more excited about the movie than watching the movie itself.",Spanglish
36,TOMNEL,A good movie.,7,15 November 2006,"Directed by: James L. Brooks. With: Paz Vega, Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni, Shelbie Bruce, Cloris Leachman and Thomas Haden Church.All I can really say about this is it is a competent drama, with some comedy thrown in, that didn't leave an extremely lasting impression, but who cares? The acting in this is really good, and you really care for or against certain characters. The direction was great. The writing was pretty good. The plot of this is Flor (Vega) is a Hispanic woman that only speaks Spanish hired as a maid for a dysfunctional family, and helping out a struggling father (Adam Sandler). Tea Leoni plays her part to perfection as the cheating wife that cares more for her maid's daughter than her own. Cloris Leachman plays the alcoholic mother that's in it for comic relief. I recommend this, not for a good laugh, but because it's a good, interesting movie.My rating: *** out of ****. 108 mins. PG-13 for language, sexuality.",Spanglish
37,triple8,liked the performers better then the movie itself.,6,28 May 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:I do not think Spanglish was a bad movie at all. It had a lot of heart and I liked the quirky casting. Spanglish is kind of an odd movie in that it really doesn't fit one specific genre. I did like aspects of it but overall I just did not get into it all that much.One problem I had was that certain scenes were really interesting but others lacked a certain something. I was alternately interested and then not so much. I am not sure the lengthiness added a lot to the movie but others may differ on that. One thing that was cool was Tea Leone as the abrasive wife. Leone has a real down to earth quality a lot of actresses lack and I have often thought she should be getting more complex roles other then the sidekick which she has played a lot. This is a meaty role for her and she plays it quite well.Paz Vega puts in a beautiful and touching performance and is captivating as the main character.And then there's Adam Sandler. The movie is to be commended for taking some chances with it's casting. Sandler was very good in this although I like seeing him more in light comedy which seems to be more his niche. He brings a lot of depth to this role though and it's always nice to see performers playing against type. Nothing wrong with that.And ultimately there's really nothing wrong with Spanglish either. The themes explored are relevant, relationships develop naturally, the movie is excellent at character development, but ultimately I just did not get as involved in it as maybe I expected to. Still isn't unwatchable and is definitely original hence my vote of 6. I may check this out again at some further time and definitely see it if you want to see talented people playing against type. My vote is 6.5 out of 10.",Spanglish

They hire a Mexican housekeeper (Paz Vega) who has a young daughter. The plot revolves around one summer spent at a Malibu beach house, where the wife -- played in Leoni's patented high-strung, neurotic style -- attempts to make life better for the housekeeper's daughter. Only she woos the girl with her upper class lifestyle that is ill-suited to this recent immigrant. The movie then becomes a tug of war between the two women for the girl's soul. Also, the wife is cheating on her husband, and the increasingly lonely husband and housekeeper slowly fall for one another. The movie, which doesn't end where you might expect it to, is narrated by the housekeeper's daughter as a grown woman undergoing a college interview. Not bad. Rare to see a subdued Sandler. Touching beach scene between Sandler and Vega. And a very funny foot race between Vega and Leoni.",Spanglish
39,rosscinema,Brooks suffers a misfire,4,18 December 2004,"It's rare to see a director with this much talent write and direct a film that misses practically every opportunity to be something of consequence. It does happen from time to time and it definitely happened here despite a very good cast that tries they're darndest. Story is about Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) who along with her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) immigrate from Mexico to Los Angeles in search of work. Flor gets a job as a housekeeper for a wealthy family named the Clasky's and even though she can't speak English they are taken with her. John (Adam Sandler) is a successful chef and his two children adore him but he's married to Deborah (Tea Leoni) who says and does every inappropriate thing imaginable.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Also in the household is Deborah's mother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) who's a former jazz singer and an alcoholic but Flor's biggest obstacle comes when Deborah goes overboard with Cristina and not only buys her gifts but enrolls her in an expensive boarding school which makes the Clasky's daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) feel inadequate. John does his best to support Deborah through her mood swings but he leaves to get away when she reveals that she has been cheating. John takes Flor to his restaurant and they discover that they are attracted to one another but she knows that nothing can become of it and has to quit her job if she wants her daughter back to reclaim the solid relationship they once had.James L. Brooks has been one of our finest writers and directors for almost 30 years and has churned out some truly memorable films but every once in a while he stumbles and he stumbles pretty badly here. There isn't much question that the script written by Brooks is the source for the problems since the cast is first rate but these talented actors are forced to speel out jargon that is at times incoherent. Vega and Sandler come out the best and there seems to be some real chemistry between them but they're still forced to speak things out of turn. I personally was getting pretty sick of Sandler continually apologizing for everything and you had to wonder why most of the characters refuse to speak like normal people. Leachman was the most coherent and when she spoke it was simple and to the point but everyone else either rambled or kept beating around the bush which just confused Vega even more since she didn't understand English. Leoni is a talented actress but she's rarely been used correctly and here she gives us one of the most annoying characters in film history. Her character is so over the top that it becomes impossible to believe that Sandler would have ever married her, or even given her a second date! Vega is an emerging star and drop dead gorgeous and if this film does anything right it keeps her on screen for most of the duration. Brooks is a rare talent and I hope this is just a temporary slump because this is a script that desperately needed a rewrite.",Spanglish
40,valadas,Sentimental puzzle,7,28 April 2005,"This dramatic comedy expresses itself through a real sentimental puzzle whose parts end by creeping in the right places what isn't exactly the same thing as a happy end. It is however worthy of notice that the would-be spectator must not let himself to be deluded into believing that he or she will watch a more or less folkloric clash between American and Mexican cultures just only because the whole story develops itself around a beautiful Mexican widow who enters as a maid in a rich American house without knowing a word of English in the beginning. That's not what this movie is about since there are no scenes of contrast or conflict between habits, customs, ideas or feelings natural to each of those cultures not even in the culinary field although the male main character is a great restaurant chef. The story told here is one of encounters and separations so common in this modern bourgeois life even in the familiar and marital fields. It's however a story full of sentimental and factual authenticity about good people whom life not always spares since unforeseen (but shouldn't they be foreseen?) events are peeping around any corner and life stumbles a lot along. The characters are admirably well placed in the story context from the half-crazy, impulsive and hothead American wife to (last but not least) her mother, an alcoholic but wise old woman who plays at several moments the part of common sense. The movie has got funny scenes but also high level sentimental ones. I wish however to highlight here which must be the funniest sex scene between husband and wife that I have seen filmed till now. There is another very deep and intense sentimental scene near the end nevertheless showing a great emotional restraint and self-control of its participants. The performers'work is good namely of Téa Leoni as the American wife. However I think that Paz Vega (gorgeous indeed) playing the Mexican maid acts in a somewhat affected and caricatural way. So we have here a movie not to be missed.",Spanglish

42,MartianOctocretr5,"Awkward in places, OK overall",6,2 October 2006,"Adam Sandler lets somebody else do the jokes for once, while he plays the ""straight man,"" and it works pretty well. He and his wife (Tea Leoni) hire a live-in maid named Flor (Paz Vega) with a 12 year old daughter (Shelbie Bruce).At first, Flor's English is quite poor, and when her daughter Christina isn't around to translate, communication is an awkward series of hand motions and loud annunciating carefully, which of course is useless except as a comic device. She dreams of a better life for her and her daughter, and makes a sincere effort to achieve this.Vega and Bruce were really the strength of the film; they delivered their often hilarious lines with surprisingly expert comedic timing. There is one routine where Flor is screaming at Sandler's character, and Christina translating for both at a hundred words a minute. I wonder how many takes were necessary for this scene--it's flawless.Sandler's character is the epitome of a nice guy, and the romantic temptation tension with Flor is handled quite well. Tea Leoni is pretty good too, as a well-meaning but very neurotic and needy wife to Sandler. Her actions are reckless and foolish as she unintentionally angers other characters, making it difficult to discern if she's meant to be a comedic or serious character. In fact, the movie in several situations makes some awkward transitions between drama and comedy.The movie has some moments, but there doesn't seem to be much direction. There are various subplots in the interaction of these four people, but the substance is lacking. Still, the characters are mostly likable, and there are enough one-liners to keep you entertained.

This effort is totally out of the league of James Brooks' previous ones even his poorest. There is absolutely no chemistry between Adam Sandler and Paz Vega who puts a new interpretation on flatness. And Tea Leoni, oh my. The screaming and over the top yelling has to be seen to be believed and was there ever so much snotty crying. You just don't care about her, she could fall over the edge of that Malibu deck and we'd all breathe a sigh of relief. Adam Sandler's scenes with Sarah Steele are sweet but I, for one, spent the whole movie wondering what he was doing with his wife, this squawking, screaming harridan who prefers solitary sex. 4 out of 10 for Cloris and Sarah.

44,dunmore_ego,Renaissance Sandler,6,9 January 2006,"STOP THE PRESSES: Adam Sandler can act! In a stunning demonstration of ""playing against type"", Boy Sandler actually portrays a Real Human in ""Spanglish"" - a well-rounded, successful husband and father, as far removed from any of his other roles as Rob Schneider is from comedy.As Darth Vader might say: Impressive! Most impressive! Now let's put this in perspective: in this film, Sandler is still no Gary Oldman or Harrison Ford, but has wisely opted to eschew that nerve-jangling character that has heartily nauseated us over the years, with the voice akin to nails on a blackboard and the sensibility of a retarded marmoset, to play it courageously straight. Not having seen ""Punch-Drunk Love"", I suspect that his role in ""Spanglish"" resurrects the intelligent Sandler that audiences discovered in that previous film, as oxymoronic as that may sound...Playing noted chef John Clasky, replete with neurotically-fit bombshell spouse (Téa Leoni, sensationally vivacious as Deb, yet marred psychologically), frumpy daughter (played with good cheer by Sarah Steele), live-in mother-in-law (Cloris Leachman, in a heartfelt performance), son and pooch to boot, Sandler is here, in essence, a Normal Human Being, as opposed to the fringe pariahs he has bulked his career with.Into this family unit comes a Spanish housekeeper, Flor (voluptuous Paz Vega), who develops a hesitant, platonic intimacy with John, not least due to his wife's unthinking behavior and neurotic episodes indirectly nudging them together.Flor's daughter enters the equation when the family moves to a Malibu beach house for the summer. In her first feature film, 12-year-old Shelbie Bruce (as Cristina) floors us with a right-outa-the-gate performance that could school a few adults on acting subtleties. In a breakout scene, she translates English and Spanish between Flor and John, taking on the attitudes of each speaker in her attempts to convey the import of their words faithfully. Not only did this scene highlight Shelbie's bilingual talents and bravura instincts, it was also the deal-maker for Sandler, where we finally admit to his controlled performance as being not just a fluke or performed by a stunt double with acting training.As unlikely as it may sound, this is a romantic film without a payoff - itself a species of pariah in the Hollywood mainstream - yet its multi-layered and nuanced chops (by Sandler, Leoni and Vega) allows its non-adulterous climax to play itself out maturely and believably.A typical James L. Brooks vehicle, which seems to neither move forward nor stagnate, I applaud his belief in and casting of Sandler, in this role which could have effortlessly been filled by a Michael Keaton, Jeff Bridges or a Ben Stiller. I must admit that being ""pleasantly stunned"" by Adam Sandler - as a romantic leading man, no less - is an intriguing emotion, alien to my being. After this review, I'll need a strong drink and a smack on the botty to bring me to my senses.After spending a lifetime egregiously miscast in movies that have never called for him to extend his range farther than ""imbecile"" - as loathe as I am to admit this without electrodes attached to my well-toned pecs - Adam Sandler has grown up! Maybe Rob Schneider will take a hint.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Spanglish
45,film-critic,If you don't stop talking I'm going to set my hair on fire and start punching myself in the face.,2,11 May 2005,"Oh, what a massive disappointment James L. Brooks has created. Not being too excited about his work after seeing the devastatingly poor film As Good As It Gets, I thought that he may be able to redeem himself with some Sandler magic, while showcasing the point (like P.T. Anderson did) that Sandler has this very rich emotional side to him as well as the hysterical moments. Sadly, this never did happen. With an extremely choppy story, some overzealous acting by everyone involved, and one of the poorest production values this side of the Hollywood Mississippi, Spanglish proves that you can have a powerful cast, an interesting idea, and an Oscar winning director, but unless you compile them correctly, all you have is a jumbled mess of garbage.My largest issue with this film has to be the unconnected story. There were so many creative ideas in this film, that from the outside it looked like it could have been an Oscar contender, but as you view it from the inside, it is nothing but unfinished roads and dead ends. Brooks knows how to tell a story, in fact, he has won an Oscar for telling his stories, but in Spanglish, he took in more than he could handle. There were so many different elements in this film, from Leoni's secret, to Sandler's cooking, to Vega's mothering skills, to a child's dream, that Brooks could not keep up with them all and successfully bring conclusions to each of them. Spanglish jumped from one moment to the next without giving the viewer an opportunity to say, ""Well, at least that was resolved"". It was so choppy that I hoped that Brooks would have provided seat belts to anyone watching. With all these themes and elements converging into a very anticlimactic ending, you leave this story with a sense of ""wha"" You have no real grasp on this story, the characters, or the ending as the final credits begin to roll. Who was the true protagonist to the story? Who was the central focus? What were the major themes that I should have been watching? There were so many negative ""who"" and ""what"" questions at the end of this movie that I immediately threw the case to the corner of the room as if it were possessed. Brooks crafted a pitiful story that he could not control, and the final product was this hastily made story, which began in the middle of nowhere and thankfully ended there as well.With the story giving us nothing but questions instead of answers, it is then left up to the actors to carry the weight of the entertainment on their shoulders. Again, with Sandler, Leoni, and Vega, you think that you would have an amazing dynamic set in place that a story could be poor without anyone noticing. Well, let me tell you  it was noticeable. Sandler was not the lead that Brooks needed for this film. While it is obvious that he can play an ""every man"" quite well, it is the emotional pressures that he has trouble with. The scene in which he is asked to cry is  well  hysterically pathetic. There is just no excitement around his character, and at one time I referred to his character in this film as ""bland"". I think it is because Tea Leoni, who puts too much emotion into her character, poorly balances him out. Here you have Sandler doing a low-key performance, and Leoni is well over the top. There was no development in either of their characters, just screaming and crying. This does not help progress the story well either. Vega added nothing more than a ""cute"" element that honestly wasn't needed at all. The only character that I thought did an exceptional job was Cloris Leachman who took these horrible performances and created her moment to shine. She stole the film from everyone else, and I was proud of her.Finally, I would like to say that if your films have won Oscars in the past, and you are living well off The Simpsons money, than you have the budget to film actors actually driving a car to their destination instead of just using a green screen and fake driving. Maybe it was just me, but I felt as if the production value of this film was not Hollywood standards. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind a low-budget film at all, but I felt that Brooks was being super-cheap in Spanglish. This hurt this film tremendously. Maybe it was the DVD transfer, but it felt as if Brooks was cutting numbers in the film and it began with the production value. It started out strong, but somehow felt less and less like itself by the end. This did not make for good cinematic viewing.Overall, I was very unimpressed with this picture. Brooks had a decent idea that somewhere along the creation of it went horribly wrong. One could say that he had too many ideas and could not carry the weight of them all successfully on his camera. There were ideas piled upon ideas that literally went nowhere, nor didn't really have any conclusion. The elements were there, Brooks couldn't do anything with them. Coupled with the fact that there was not any decent acting in the entire film. This emotional step was too big for Sandler (and too fast), while Leoni was too over-the-top. Vega felt like a stand in, while I just couldn't grasp the kiddy elements. Finally, what hurt this film the most, I believe was the poor production value (especially in the car scenes) that brought this film into the realm of bad news bears. While I think I am in the minority, I believe that this was not the greatest outing for Brooks, nor anyone else involved.Grade: * out of *****",Spanglish

Tears and laughter result, or so the scriptwriters hope.""Spanglish"" is a confused, wishy washy soap opera targeted, mostly, at men undergoing identity and/or marital crises. It doesn't hold together at all.The casting and performances are wonderful all around. Adam Sandler is adorable and low key as a loving husband and father who also happens to be ""the best chef in the United States."" Cloris Leachman is wryly funny as a grandmother and aging jazz singer. Sarah Steele is the cutest little fat girl ever to play a cute little fat girl on film.Tea Leoni surpasses even her hysterical performance in ""Flirting with Disaster."" She plays Deborah Klasky, a high-strung, highly driven, neurotic, Politically Correct, New Age, upper middle class, California housewife. Leoni is the funniest and most interesting thing in the entire movie. Too bad the movie uses her so badly.The problem with the movie is the script. It's awkward and incoherent.Paz Vega is one of the most beautiful women ever to grace the screen. She's in the same class with Ava Gardner. But, except as eye candy and fantasy food, she just doesn't work here.First, Vega hasn't learned to act yet, or even just to pose in front of a camera. Rather, she fidgets and jerks. She doesn't look like a poor Mexican for one second; most poor Mexicans in this country have distinctive Mesitzo features. Vega was born in Spain and she looks and sounds Spanish, not Mexican.Vega's beauty is so spectacular that the viewer cannot believe for one moment that the character she plays would have spent any time as a domestic servant. Life offers richer goodies to women who look like Paz Vega.The movie wants us to believe that Sandler falls in love with Vega for her good parenting skills. That Vega is so spectacularly physically perfect makes it really hard for the audience to accept this.Finally, Vega never disappears into her character. She struts through the film as if hyper aware of her status as the next Penelope Cruz. She gives no sign of being the character she is supposed to be, and zero sign of being in love with Adam Sandler's character.This is a shame, because the audience does respond to the sweetness in Sandler's character. Vega's ""romantic"" scenes with Sandler offer none of the chemistry that Sandler's romantic scenes with Drew Barrymore in ""The Wedding Singer"" offer.The movie tries to deal with some huge, difficult themes: a failing marriage, an abusive mother, a wounded daughter, adultery, the sexual attentions of a boss on his live-in servant. It tries to deal with these themes with the tone of a TV sitcom. This never works.Ultimately, nothing happens. Sandler falls in love with Vega, and does not act on that love. Vega falls in love with Sandler, and simply leaves her job.Tea Leoni never gives any indication that she's going to stop being the funny but repellent psycho wife and mother she has been throughout the film. Sandler gives no sign that he will grow up and become a man who can stand up to his wife and get the romantic and sexual satisfaction we want him to have, but that the movie makes sure to let us know he does not enjoy.The movie wasn't as funny as it wanted to be, or as deep as it wanted to be, or as romantic as it wanted to be.

49,jpschapira,"Welcome back, Jim",8,2 May 2005,"The fact that Adam Sandler can act in movies like ""The Waterboy"" and then in movies as ""Spanglish"" at the same time, it's something unexplainable as it is gratifying. Maybe ""The Waterboy"" wasn't the best example, but he can write characters as the one he played in ""Big Daddy""; and we'll see him screaming and going nuts, but in a charming way. Then, in movies like ""Spanglish"", when other person is directing him and writing his words, the true actor comes out. He's a natural! And I'm thankful in both cases (three, if we count his powerful performance in ""Punch-Drunk Love""). Now ""Spanglish"" (playing John Clasky) may not be a great movie, but it is surely the showcase of one of Sandler's best performances. I have followed him since ""The Wedding Singer"", and he has never disappointed me (even if some of his movies have).James L. Brooks has really been ""off"" since his last film, ""As good as it gets"". With that movie he managed to get the best of his actors (Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear), putting the characters in absolutely real, honestly and beautifully written situations, in gorgeous sceneries, with straight filming cameras. He knows his material, and I don't blame him if it took seven years for him to create another wonderful script, just to achieve the same objectives he achieved those seven years ago, in a movie ""as good"" as ""As good as it gets"".In the exact definition of ""dramedy"", Brooks introduces us to his characters, as he explores the barrier the Spanish and English cultures; because it's not just about the language. To describe the way the characters relationships develop is to ruin the magic of the movie.However, none of these magical scenes could have been possible if Brooks hadn't got an amazing cast and directed it so well. Téa Leoni (Deborah Clasky), in her best role since ""Hollywood ending"", feels comfortable doing comedy, as a depressive obsessive woman, whose ways of thinking could affect her whole family. Brooks is an expert in writing these types of characters; he makes Leoni shine. Paz Vega (Flor Moreno), in her first role in Hollywood, seems as good as if she had been doing it for years now. She's a gorgeous woman and capable of giving a lot of personality to her character; becoming the film's revelation. Of course, Brooks must have been really helpful to her (she didn't know English; the team had to work); and she must be grateful for that. Her similarity to Penélope Cruz when the movie started was awkward; but I forgot about it as soon as she started talking; in Spanish. Shelbie Bruce (Cristina) was a delight to watch. I thought I had seen her before somewhere, but apparently this is her first role. She succeeds in dominating both languages (mostly in the ""translation scene"", where she translates to John everything Flor says and vice verse) and makes her role more important than it should be. Sarah Steele (Bernice) is also surprising and deeply involved with her role; I also thought I had seen her before. Including Ian Hyland (Georgie), Brooks achieves an excellent directing work with the three first time child actors. Last but not least, the old pro Cloris Leachman (Evelyn) has the best lines and walks around the set as if she was living on it. Her presence gives warmth to the screen, and accentuates the film's charm.The film's charm is in Brooks' magic, as he shows to us both sides of the coin. In scenes like the ""translation"" scene, or Evelyn's moments, laughter arrives naturally to our surprise, and we enjoy. But then, in the end, he gives the powerful and dramatic scenes, that keep growing until the last minute, reaching a touch of deep realism in every word the characters speak.

51,RanchoTuVu,as good as it gets,9,27 July 2005,"Like life itself, this film mixes comedy and drama, portraying a cultural and economic divide between a Mexican housekeeper and her daughter and the well to do family that she works for. In the end it's a brilliant take on the shallowness, materialism, and trendy upper class lifestyles of the latter. The central contrast of Paz Vega as Flor, the beautiful but down to earth housekeeper and Tea Leoni as Deborah Claskey, the well off homemaker and fitness buff is so true and humorous it's almost uncomfortable at times. It encompasses much of the emptiness of a wasteful upper middle class that fixates on physical fitness and not intellectual development. Tea Leoni's performance as Deborah nails so much of the manners and prevailing intrinsic attitudes. She is put out there for all of us to laugh at, her stereotyped characterization not far from a sad reality. From James Brooks who gave us As Good As It Gets, Spanglish is almost better, coming out now, and being very sympathetic to the situation as well as bringing out the best in its cast.",Spanglish

53,nicholas.rhodes,Interesting Subject Matter -,8,5 March 2005,"This was a very curious film indeed ! It's only been showing in SIX cinemas in Paris, France and effectively, I suspect its subject matter is of little interest to the average European ( with the possible exception of Spain for obvious reasons ).I myself was attracted to the film film for three reasons ; I love speaking Spanish, I am fond of Téa Leoni, and I am fascinated by Mexico as a country and the mentality of Mexicans.I was amazed that during the passages in Spanish during the film that there were no English subtitles. How could they have forgotten a thing like that ? Not every prospective viewer is necessarily Spanish-speaking. Or are they ? This leads me to believe that the film may in fact be destined to a limited audience, notably hispanics and not your average man / woman in the street.Much as I love Téa Léoni, she had a very ungrateful rôle in this film but acted it out very well. Flor is all beauty of course, and the two little girls, Bernice and Cristina are really cute. I already know very little about the gentleman actor, Adam Sandler, and certainly was n't impressed by his performance which seemed to be flabby and lacking in punch.I am sure that for a non-American as myself, many of the subtleties of the film may have been lost - I found there were some funny moments, some tender and passionate moments - and indeed some frustrating moments. But I felt there were some lengthy passages where the film seemed to be going nowhere. Also the mother Flor's decision in removing her daughter from the private school seems most odd indeed - most parents want the best for their children, even if they haven't had it themselves ! To fully appreciate the film then, I think prior knowledge of Amercican plus hispanic American culture is probably a prerequisite. For the rest of us, the film comes over as ""interesting subject matter"" but perhaps lacking in punch and vitality.",Spanglish
54,bopdog,"Great cast, great acting. Unpredictable, deep, and real. An excellent, fun, and moving family love story!",9,25 February 2005,"'Spanglish' just opened today in the UK. I really liked it. It is not the masterpiece of the century--- but by definition, very few things are. However, it is a good, entertaining movie. Adam Sandler turned in a surprisingly sympathetic and likable characterization. Tea Leoni, who has always been hot, plays a neurotic lady, who would be very hard to live with in real life. Her character is not actually redeemed, as such, which is a good thing, because such a contrived denouement would have been a disappointing cop-out anyway. Instead, through what felt like the natural course of her life events, she does display a few sparks of the beginnings of redeeming qualities. This gives us the hint that maybe the character will make some changes and become a deserving wife, mother, partner in the future--- albeit with a LOT of hard work ahead of her.The Spanish housekeeper is harder to pinpoint--- was James L. Brook's original conceptualization of this character that she be some kind of almost mystic savior figure? Probably not, but there are hints that Brooks may have seen her as a bit more 'special' than she actually was. She is definitely attractive, and motherly, and kindly. The maid was shown to have an occasional insight, and helpful nature. But she also displayed some Old World values and stubbornness that to me, anyway, bordered on stupidity and ego-tripping. Obviously, we can all expect to see a lot more of the hot Spanish actress who played her-- Paz Vega.The daughters of the Spanish lady and Sandler/Leoni were amazing child actors. They were appealing, and very real. No smart-ass one-liners or ultra-cool kid behavior we often see in children on TV or the movies. I found them not only believable, but I sympathized with them as well. In fact, the two daughter people may be the most realistic depictions of kids in the movies I have ever seen.Overall, the hero of the movie is the grandma, played by Cloris Leachman. She was AMAZING! And her character, in many ways, is really the key element that saved everybody, in the times and places they got saved. I would love to have a crazy old lady like that as an in-law, or neighbor, or friend. The movie takes a few predictable courses, but also follows a more meaningful course than merely resolving plot issues. It was original, and real, and tried to do something beyond mere sex and Hollywood--- and it succeeded. I gave it a well deserved 9 out of 10.",Spanglish

And he was surprisingly good; he should have done it more often.But unfortunately this film is not about him; it is about the immigrant Mexican's mother and her daughter try to start a new life in the US where she work as a maid in a rich but shaky family.This film might actually not to everybody liking. Cause more or less there hardly anything to the movie unless you try to guess what character is thinking and social status in the society. Anyway the movie is fun to watch, literally fun and entertaining. The casting is brilliant  Adams is better than I thought, Tea also gives a memorable performance as an unsecured wife, and Paz also give a good performance as a mother, also she is hot. The story is solid and everything seems to work well including the style of the movie. I really do enjoy watching it.Recommendation: Yes, I Think You Will It Just Fine.

That was the film we were dying to see because of it's first successful film, Meet the Parents was so good. But we realized that the movie was sold out so we decided not to go home for that and see Spanglish. My dad and I were quite disappointed in seeing it and then we both got out of the movies with the same feeling. To tell you the truth I am not in to these kind of comedies but I have to tell you it was decent. The actors were pretty good especially Adam Sandler, I thought he was pretty funny and Paz Vega was a very attractive actress and I was just mainly fixed on her and her daughter will grow up to be very good looking. Other than that the movie was just too long for a 2 hour and 10 minute movie. I was like uncomfortable in my seat for that long period of time and I was like, ""When is it going to end."" Some scenes also in the film were quite boring and just almost put me to sleep of how slow it got and how long it was. Overall, I guess it was not a bad film after all and some scenes were pretty funny, even though I really didn't show the laugh.

58,departed07,A different kind of Adam Sandler movie,8,23 February 2008,"Over the years, people have known Adam Sandler for portraying goof balls in the sketches of Saturday Night Live before mainstreaming into movies for which critics have felt he often portrays himself as a retard that must be put in an institution immediately. Here, he plays a different kind of character that doesn't involve his love for the Yankees, patriotism or bringing his buddies to ruin moments.""Spanglish"" starts with Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a Mexican who runs away from her husband while taking her daughter where she wants to start a new life. After slums, her sister finds her work as a housemaid for the Clasky family where not only is she lucky to have a job and have money for herself, she gets to know the family a little better.John Clasky (Adam Sandler) is the bread and butter in the family where he plays an accomplish chef for a top Los Angeles restaurant. He loves his family so much that whenever his presence is shown, there's not a bit of anger or goofiness in him to make you want to forget this film. His wife is portrayed by Tea Leoni in which she plays Deborah, an over achiever who is not only a perfectionist freak in terms of doing the right thing but also in terms of what her children should eat and wear. Deborah works in real estate where behind her back, she's cheating on John with one of her clients. Cloris Leachman plays Evelyn, Deborah's mother, who is very calm and peaceful where not only does she accept Flor as part of the family but she must have her drink of wine at noon to start her day. Evelyn knows what's going on with the relationship between Deborah and her mistress that she only wants her daughter to remember that she still has a good husband back home. Sarah Steele and Ian Hyland play the Clansky children that accept Flor's daughter, Christina (Shelbie Bruce) in their lives and think of her as one of the family.For those who don't know what the term Spanglish means, it's a mixture between English and Spanish dialog.James L. Brooks directs this movie where knowing Mr. Brooks' point of view, he mixes in dramady within all his films. It was also very subtle of him not to place in subtitles when Flor or Christina spoke Spanish since he figure if most people in America could figure out certain stuff, why not understand Spanish? This is a very different Adam Sandler movie where even though he's going to be known for making goof ball movies, I would recommend that he would try to make more of these films.",Spanglish

I had almost lost all hope they could make such movies any more. Without any major plot, action, special f/x, flashy soundtrack or any other distraction, this movie nevertheless has it all; it is funny, dramatically serious and entertaining all at the same time.In watching this film, we identify with the characters, we get involved, we care... This is really a movie well done, well directed, well acted, and above all, one with a real screenplay for a change. As usual, I am not surprised but I am appalled that the Academy overlooked this movie completely; not even one Nomination, and the film would have deserved at least a couple (best screenplay, best supporting actress, best actress). On the downside, once again, 'Hollywoodian political correctness' ruins it all in the end. If the movie had ended 2-3 minutes before it actually did, it would have deserved another star. The last scene (which was obviously hailed by most critics as the movies strongest moment) simply ruins it all by making the ending just another soapy Hollywood cliché'.

Brooks. (Did I miss everything about, ""As good as it gets?"") Anyways the whole cast was just fantastic in this film, Cloris, Tea, Adam, Paz (where did she come from, and please god come back!) and the daughter...wow! I expected a mediocre film, but was so touched by the whole relationship between Adam and his two loves. I was so conflicted because I don't know if I would have done the right thing as he had. I think what really did it for me, was as badly Adams' character wanted to just give in to pure attraction and plain old fashioned lust, he knew what it would to his family and how it could completely disrupt his family and his beautiful kids lives. I love the fact that this so un-hollywoodic and that he resisted the temptation and thought about others than what is primordial instincts wanted. I think that everyone who ever thought about cheating or doing anything for that matter that might be detrimental to his kids and his family life should see this film. I am probably naive none-the-less never being married or with kids, but I never cry at films and I bawled at least three times during this film. (Last film I cried at, ""The Green Mile"") I recommend everyone to this fantastically crafted and written film, that reflects almost too much about what real life can be about. James, I will never doubt you again! You made a fan for life here. (who knows I may even try to watch ""As good as it gets again!"") No guarantees though Mr. Brooks!",Spanglish
61,christian123,Some good performances but its a missed opportunity,5,10 March 2005,"Spanglish is a decent movie with good intentions but the movie seems too fake. John and Deborah Clasky (Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni) are having enough trouble with their dysfunctional marriage before they decide to bring in a Mexican woman (Paz Vega) as housekeeper. Since she doesn't speak any English, her teen daughter has to act as a translator to the insane Clasky lifestyle. The plot sounds interesting but the way it was handled made it very boring and predictable. It wasn't a terrible movie just wasn't as good as one would expect. Luckily Téa Leoni is in this movie and her performance is really good. Adam Sandler does a really good job and shows again that he can take on a serious role. Paz Vega is pretty good but this isn't her first movie as she has been in Spanish film before. The rest of the cast does a decent job but not good enough to save this movie. The heartwarming moments seem fake and its hard to care for these characters because they are rather mean. The story also isn't very realistic like she learns to speak English really fast and doesn't seem to have any trouble. There's also a lot of screaming, I know that they are going through a problem but they went overboard with all the screaming. James L. Brooks has better work out there and this is probably his worst film but even his worst film isn't terrible.. He seems to be taking this film lightly and isn't trying very hard to make a good movie. This movie was made with Oscar intentions but obviously that didn't work out but there are still some funny moments to be have with this film..

62,AishFan,Nice movie with important messages,6,25 May 2005,"This movie, in addition to being entertaining, has some very nice and important themes. All the characters' feelings and reactions to other people's sayings and actions are all natural, yet at the same time they are not justified, which is shown beautifully throughout the movie. Sandler's daughter is verbally and emotionally abused by her mother for being overweight. These scenes are very heartbreaking, teaching us the important lesson that all people are beautiful and that we have no right to humiliate anyone because of their looks. Flor's daughter begins to adopt the personality of the ""stereotypical American child"" by disrespecting and scorning her mother. Flor's daughter, who is narrating the movie in the background, teaches us another very important lesson. In the midst of zealously fighting for our rights and pursuing the American Dream, we often end up putting our family and loved ones aside. For our own personal interests, we find ourselves disrespecting, humiliating, and hurting those who care for us the most. At some point, we need to pause, and love those who mean so much to us. One thing that I didn't like about this movie was I thought that Sandler's wife was depicted as complete vamp. I thought she deserved some sympathy. Under the wrong impression that this is an Adam Sandler movie, the real hero is Flor. In this movie, Sandler is not the usual crazy guy he is famous for.",Spanglish
63,Okonh0wp,4 stars,9,28 March 2005,"The movie's title really says what the film is all about: cultural differences that divide us, bridging gaps of communication, and how even among people we love those gaps exist. James L. Brooks does a great job of exploiting both the humorous and dramatic possibilities of the language barrier between a wealthy suburban family and their new Mexican housekeeper. The film starts out relying more on humor because it is most essential to keeping the audience hooked. If the humor were absent at the start, the dialogue would move too slow and we would get bored before having a chance to get attached to the characters.This would be a shame because there are some great performances in here. Adam Sandler's performance as successful chef and family patriarch John Clasky is the heart of the film. Last time I reviewed an Adam Sandler movie, 50 First Dates, I wondered if he could ever deliver a performance on screen without hitting so many bad notes, and apparently, yes, he can. His wife, played by the massively underrated Tea Leoni, is undergoing some kind of quarterlife/midlife crisis (somewhere in between since she's in her 30s). Deborah's neurotic personality isn't just a point of comedy but it's also a danger that threatens the well being of everyone around her, and Leoni's performance simultaneously exposes both sides of the character. The Clasky clan also involves two kids, one of whom barely got any lines, and Deborah's mother, Evelyn (Leachman).Paz Vega stars as Flor, a Mexican single mom, who is hired by the Clasky family first as a cleaning lady, and later, as a live-in maid. Vega is pretty, but her casting is strategic, because later in the movie when tensions start to heat up, we are blown away by the firm resolve underneath Vega's pleasant exterior. Like Sandler, and for that matter, Chloris Leachman, Vega's most touching moments in the film are with her daughter.The plot is mostly character-driven and moves at a very lifelike pace, as various relationships from two different cultures develop. The result is some deeply moving moments along with humor that anyone who's ever wished they were bilingual so that they could interact with a coworker or housekeeper could relate to.",Spanglish

The incessant conflict between the Mexican housekeeper Flor (Paz Vega) and her American employer Deborah (Téa Leoni) was so well done, as was the uneasy attraction between the latter and John (Adam Sandler) across language barriers.

66,rollernerd,Lost in translation,6,24 November 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the family comedy drama Spanglish (2004) which is narrated by daughter's relationship with her mother from the time they emigrate from Mexico for a better life in America to her mother, Flor, working as maid who speaks no English, but has endeared herself to everyone in the household family including Adam Sandler's character, a celebrated chef with an insecure emotional wife, two children and his mother-in-law who has a drinking problem. Flor, struggles to the inevitable cultural collision, a possible romance between herself and her employer and the identity crisis her daughter has found herself. The crisis itself is relative to how the second-generation defects from their parents; to achieve personal success, they must necessarily distance themselves from their cultural roots and subsequently, their parents. Paz Vega, as the radiant Flor, plays a grounded yet passionate and concerned mother who steals the film from the get go, Tea Leoni plays the insecure wife Deborah, who does well playing a typical annoying confused woman who basically has everything yet isn't grateful and is rather blind to the pleasures in life and the Sandman does well as a down-to-earth role which is grounded. Other actors who well in the movie include the mother-in-law played by Cloris Leachman who nails it as the wise and loving alcoholic grandmother who is indulged and ignored and condescended by her daughter however, ends up with some of the wisest advice she can give.

67,cosmic_quest,Quite a mess,4,22 October 2007,"I have to admit that I found 'Spanglish' to be a rather messy film that couldn't seem to decide what its message was.The film sees Flor Moreno emigrating from her native Mexico to America when her husbands runs off on her and their young daughter Cristina. Five years pass, and while Cristina adjusts, Flor refuses to learn English and instead immerses herself in the large Hispanic community in their new city of Los Angeles. Needing more money, Flor then takes a job as a maid to hot-shot chef John Clasky, his emotionally manipulative (if, seemingly, nice on the surface) wife Deborah, their teenage daughter Bernice and nine-year-old son Georgie and his mother-in-law Evelyn. However, life sours, when Deborah begins to favour the pretty Cristina over her own daughter Bernice, leaving Flor feeling she is being pushed out the life of her own child. John is left feeling as if his so-called perfect life and family are crashing down around him. And when Flor believes the private school, which Deborah has arranged for Cristina to attend on scholarship, is changing her daughter, she decides to take action...The acting in this film can't really be faulted. Paz Vega, as Flor, is able to articulate the character's feelings despite the fact much of her dialogue is in Spanish (without subtitles) and the bond between her and her daughter comes across as genuine. Téa Leoni is perfect in depicting the self-obsessed Deborah's quietly manipulative ways that is hidden by smiles and, on the surface, a warm personality. Not everyone liked Adam Sandler, as John, but I felt he was great in portraying the character is a nice guy despite his oddly feckless, weak, spineless nature. The two child actors, Shelbie Bruce and Sarah Steele, as Cristina and Bernice respectively, both shone in their roles. Bruce was able to portray Cristina well as a rather sheltered child suddenly thrust into the 'good' life while Steele was excellent as the very likable Bernice.What let 'Spanglish' down was the script. The message it seemed to be delivering was muddled and unclear, leaving Flor seeming as self-absorbed as Deborah when she should be the protagonist of the film. Deborah wants a pretty daughter and Flor wants a good little Mexican daughter. It's hard to sympathise with a woman who only has her own interests at heart. Surely, she was wrong to expect Cristina to remain completely true to her Mexican roots when she is now practically American (and if Flor doesn't like that, she shouldn't have uprooted her daughter from her birth country and dragged her a thousand miles to another country). In many ways, while her motives weren't entirely wholesome, Deborah is the one in the right trying to better integrate the Morenos' to their adopted country and in seeking the best opportunities for Cristina. Yet, it's as if this film is saying that immigrants shouldn't bother to integrate in a new country.What's worse was the unrealistic way that Flor snatches her daughter's educational opportunities because she thinks Cristina is changing. What twelve-year-old child wouldn't initially change when given a taste of how the other half lives? It doesn't mean she would remain like that nor that she wouldn't see the error of her ways if Flor had given her a good talking to. The message here is that only snobs attend private schools (I imagine any decent parent would send their child to private school, if they had the money, because-- like it or not-- many state secondary schools are dire these days thanks to thugs ruling the classrooms) and only send your kid there if you want them to become materialistic. And that if your child is developing bad mannerisms, blame the school and everyone else instead of doing your parental duties and teaching them the error of their ways.What should be a film about how a poor mother's love for her child endures over the rich mother's love for her children is instead about two selfish mothers who can't be bothered to put their kids' needs first and are instead intent on moulding the girls into little versions of themselves. The only bright spots in this film were scenes involving the two girls, especially Bernice. Other than that, it's forgettable.",Spanglish

This is probably Adam Sandler's best performance ever and the other actors are very good. The problem, like most of James L. Brooks's movies like As Good As It Gets and Jerry Maguire, this movie goes on far longer than it needs to. Spanglish tells the story of a Mexican woman getting a job for a rich white couple with two children. She brings her own daughter with her and they begin to bond together. The main problem I had with this movie is that the values of the Mexican woman's are good and the values of the white people are bad. This is apparent even when it makes no sense. In the end, the woman has quit her job and the daughter was taken out of the exclusive private school the white woman had helped her get into. Yet, the daughter got into Princeton University by disassociating themselves with the white people. Huh?! Does that make any sense to anybody else? Private schools would have given her a better chance to go to Princeton. I give this movie a mild recommendation for the characters but not for the values it tries to show.",Spanglish
69,anhedonia,"Not one of Brooks' best, but Vega shines",5,15 January 2005,"The genius of writer-director James L. Brooks is that even his sub par films often are better than much of what comes out of mainstream Hollywood these days.""Spanglish"" is, by no means, one of his best works. But it's still awfully good in places, thanks mostly to a luminescent Paz Vega, undoubtedly one of the most beautiful women in the world. Doubt me? Check out this lovely Spanish actress in ""Sex and Lucia"" (2001).The film's problems begin early. For some inexplicable reason, Brooks saddles his story with a ridiculous and needless framing device involving an application to Princeton University. This adds absolutely nothing to the story. The film would have been fine without it.Once we get into the main story, the film perks up. We get to meet Flor (Vega), her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), John Clasky (Adam Sandler), his wife Deborah (Téa Leoni), their daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) and Deborah's mom Evelyn (Cloris Leachman). They breathe life into the film and get us hooked.Brooks has a wonderful knack for capturing a character's essence with a simple gesture or line of dialogue. In ""Terms of Endearment"" (1983), it was the opening shot of Aurora pinching her sleeping daughter to make sure the child was breathing. Here, Deborah's reaction when she first sees Flor's daughter, Cristina, tells us all we need to know about her.Trouble is, Deborah's the weakest of all the characters. And she shouldn't be. She's not only awfully one-dimensional, there's seemingly nothing to her other than being a shrewish, overbearing, driven woman who has little regard for her overweight daughter's feelings. Brooks usually does driven women well. Remember Holly Hunter's Jane Craig in ""Broadcast News"" (1987)? Brooks gives Leoni little to work with. I realize why he made Deborah into that kind of person. To draw comparisons with the kindly, charming Flor. Deborah's neuroses are fascinating, but turning her into a clawing person makes it too easy for us to dislike her. She needed a few more layers to make the story more provocative.There are some heartwarming moments in the film, especially between John and Bernice. Sandler again proves that he's much better when he's not starring in ""Adam Sandler"" movies. This is an actor who needs a good, character-driven director to bring out the best in him.""Spanglish"" provides tremendous opportunities for Brooks to tackle some crucial social issues within the context of a romantic comedy. He certainly has the talent to pull it off. But perhaps he's just to soft a filmmaker to grapple with issues such as immigrant assimilation, overcoming the language barrier, ethnic tension.On the other hand, Brooks does drop in a few peerless moments. There's Deborah's very funny orgasm (which betters Meg Ryan's more famous one in a diner) and a superbly delivered three-way argument, when Cristina interprets for Flor against John.Brooks also occasionally gets it right with the dialogue. Just listen to the dialogue in a key moment between John and Deborah late in the film. Or, John's reply when Flor - my goodness, Vega oozes charm - asks him to describe her. Brooks doesn't come up with a good line or even a great line. He comes up with the perfect line.These magical moments almost make up for the film's numerous shortcomings. Honestly, I don't know exactly what Brooks was going for in ""Spanglish."" I didn't go in expecting a gritty immigrant drama, a la ""El Norte"" (1983). But I didn't expect a sitcom, either. And more often than not, ""Spanglish"" felt like one.",Spanglish
70,ikanboy,Pulls you in with it's serio comedy look at some of the bad aspects of upscale life in an American family,7,20 December 2005,"I finally saw this movie after missing it for too long. It's the only time I've seen an Adam Sandler movie, and was pleased to see that he played it straight: in fact he, along with Paz Vega, make the movie work due to their slowly found commonalities. It's really a movie about a comparison of values; the old versus the new; the conservative versus the liberal (and I do not mean in a political sense); the moral versus the material; the Spanish versus the American. Guess who wins? Sandler is quite right for this role as a weak but morally straight chef married to the wife (Tea Leoni) that California created - complete with California Zen babble spewing out of her borderline personality pores. Her like has rarely been seen on American screens: every edge of her exposed; every act an act of self aggrandizement; every sentence to anyone an impossible double bind of self centredness and self loathing that only leaves them with the impression of having their presence totally ignored. As painful as she is Sandler's inability, or unwillingness, to reign her destructiveness in is the most difficult to watch.But this is a James Brook's movie and so not all of his points hit home, simply because we know where he wants us to go: to walk the straight and narrow path of disciplined righteousness in the face of all the temptations that beset us. All fine and dandy, but hey this is America, and disciplined righteousness can be a drag, no matter how well Paz Vega pulls it off.Leoni pulls off the role well, but we have seen parts of this act before. In the last of the Crichton movies about Jurrassic Park she came on with the same desperate housewife diva act. Quiet and subtle she doesn't do. Sandler plays himself, a befuddled Shmoo with a heart of silver, but he was a wise choice as anyone more powerful or more gifted would have pulled the character away from the softness he needed.Adam's daughter, an ugly duckling complete with braces and excess fat, is portrayed quite poignantly by Sarah Steele, while her hispanic counterpart, played by Shelby Bruce does a good job of showing a young girl caught up in the American dream, while wondering if she should ditch the old world.However it is Paz Vega who steals the movie. It helps that she is quite the most gorgeous of actresses, and Brooks makes a smart move by having her speak only Spanish for the first 2/3d's of the movie, and then makes an even smarter move by not providing sub titles, because this forces us to watch the actress portray what she means by her facial expressions and gestures, and in so doing becoming mesmerized by her. I hope Hollywood doesn't spoil the romance!",Spanglish
71,alfiefamily,Brooks Film Suffers From Sandler Casting,5,14 November 2005,"I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised at just how much I liked ""Spanglish"". I'm not a big fan of either Sandler or Leoni, but I very much like the work of James L. Brooks. I believe that he is a talented, skillful filmmaker, trusts his writing, and lets the story be the focal part of the movie. He is also, along with Woody Allen, one of the only writers in Hollywood who seems to be able to write roles for women that are full of depth and interesting. It's nice to see talented actresses speak intelligent dialog.""Spanglish"" is a cross blend of several different themes interconnected by one main storyline. The threat of one culture being assimilated too quickly into another. It is also a story of family, and what it means to us, and what we will endure to hold onto it.I was totally blown away by the performance of Paz Vega. She was nothing short of breathtaking, in both her beauty and her acting. She plays the role of Flor, a single immigrant mother, who tries her best to make a better life for her daughter in a strange country. He performance was one of the best of the year.I'm happy to say that I was surprised by Tea Leoni's performance, as well. Her manic neediness, and self-absorbed attitude were handled nicely, without turning her into a caricature. Cloris Leachman was excellent as her saucy, alcoholic mother.As for Sandler, well, I'm sorry to say that he was totally miscast in this role. He wasn't bad, I just did not believe his performance. Granted, it seemed as though it would be a difficult role for most any actor to attempt, but he was just wrong for the part.While it was not a totally successful film, in my mind, I'm glad that I caught it. It's another example of intelligent film-making by a wonderful, under-appreciated director.",Spanglish
72,grahamclarke,Maybe not as bad as it gets but a very lacking vehicle,4,10 February 2008,"James L. Brook has quite a record. He's often been at the helm of projects in which everything seemed so right, (""Broadcast News"", ""Terms of Endearment"", ""As Good As it Gets""). These were all deservedly mammoth hits, (not to mention his TV work on Mary Tyler Moore, Rhoda and others.) In the light of this ""Spanglish"" has a distinct feeling of a film that just doesn't work. It falters in the vital areas of screenplay and casting. The screenplay is passable, but severely lacking the depth and humor of his previous work. Where ""Spanglish"" really comes apart in its unfortunate casting. There is a singular lack of chemistry between Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. They just don't come off as man and wife, neither do their children fare any better. Each of them may be competent, even talented actors, but in this ensemble they somehow fail to click. Sandler, perhaps the last person to play a top chef, should have turned this one down. Leoni succeeds in irritating and completely misses the comic element in her character.It becomes very uncomfortable to watch them flounder. Give this a miss.",Spanglish
73,dobbin-4,My 25th review: Spanglish is a good mix of everything.,6,19 December 2007,"Spanglish is a movie that is hard to describe, but all I know is that it is well worth watching even if only to see Adam Sandler as a different character from his usual self. The movie is about a Spanish immigrant who gets a job as a maid at a rich family's home ( headed by Adam Sandler and Teo Lioni) but there she falls for Adam Sandler's character. The movie is extremely witty and has a good feel to it that makes the movie a definite feel good to feel bad movie. Overall this movie is extremely good and is worth watching for fans of movies in general and I do not know anyone sane that does not respect this movie for what it is. I rate this 64% and from an Adam Sandler fans point of view he does a great job being different in this movie.",Spanglish
74,ScottDMenzel,A not so typical dramedy with good performances all around even by Sandler,7,30 January 2005,"So I finally got around to ""Spanglish"", another movie that I kind of wanted to see but was never really a priority but since January keeps releasing only one or two pieces of crap each weekend then I figured I catch up on one of the last movies of 2004 that I sort of wanted to see. So here is my review of ""Spanglish"" Spanglish is about a Mexican woman named Flor (Paz Vega) who snuck over the border to live in California. Very believable because I live in California and trust me this stuff happens everyday. Anyway, she lives in Los Angeles working two jobs and is bringing up her daughter Christina (Shelbie Bruce). So one day she decides that she needs a new job so she goes with her friend on a job interview at the Clasky residence where they need a new housekeeper/babysitter. Needless to say, Flor gets the job however the problem is that she only speaks Spanish and they only speak English so that's how they get the title Spanglish. The family however can't understand her problems or talk to her until one day when she sees how badly the mother Deborah (Téa Leoni) treats her daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele)and then she decides that she needs to learn English so she can help her and understand what's going on in the family. The movie then turns into a movie about cultures clashing and families failing apart but without giving away any details touching, and funny moments do follow ""Spanglish"" was actually a nice surprise. I was really thinking the worst about the film when I walked into it. I haven't really liked anything Adam Sandler has been in since ""Happy Gilmore."" I mean some of his movies are passable but nothing I would sit down to watch again or buy on DVD. ""Spanglish"" was actually a pleasant surprise because not only was Sandler not in it as much as the trailer lead me to think but he was actually not making any googoo gaagaa noises and didn't try to be funny. The movie basically focuses around a dysfunctional family. I love movies about messed up families. I found that out just the other day. Because I just think of the TV shows I like i.e. ""Cracking Up"" and ""Arrested Development"" both are about dysfunctional families. But ""Spanglish"" is also about two different cultures clashing together, the poor Mexican culture and the rich white-collar culture. It's nice to see a film that was pretty nicely paced and did not feature the run of the mill script. A movie that for once starred Adam Sandler in a main role but wasn't dumb funny but actually was creative funny and touching. I also thought the ending was halfway decent. It didn't end the way I thought it was going to.The writer and director for ""Spanglish"" was James L Brooks who is a master at film from directing and writing some great movies such as ""As Good As It Gets"", ""Broadcast News"", and ""Terms of Endearment."" He wrote and directed a good movie here not as good as the ones I just listed but it was still good compared to most of the crap that is released into theaters. I liked the script more then his directing because of its character development and the interesting lives of these characters. You really felt like you knew each character and was involved in their lives. You laughed at the characters and felt bad for them as well. The story at first seemed to be very typical but then moved past that point later on. The ending was very un-Hollywood. You came out of the theater with some questions, for yourself, the viewer to ponder about. It was very much like life, which is what I liked about it. I also have to say thank you to Mr. Brooks for finally getting Adam Sandler to act normal for a change and show he can act if he wants to however he will never be anywhere as good as Jim Carrey in ""Eternal Sunshine"" or ""The Truman Show"" but this movie again proves that we don't want our funnyman actors to act serious because although ""Eternal Sunshine"" received great reviews and ""Spanglish"" received better than average reviews but neither did that well. Each was well received but neither made money. You throw out crap like ""The Longest Yard"" into theaters and it will make at least $100 million but these movies can barely make its budget and that's a shame.So In Conclusion, ""Spanglish"" isn't flawless, it has its problems like being a tad to long and taking to much time to get to the point at times but as a whole it's a pretty well made movie. There's nothing award winning about it, just a good little movie to watch, have a few chuckles with maybe even shed a few tears with. It's a good movie, some really funny moments, some touching moments, and a good not so typical story. I couldn't help think throughout the whole movie that the main actress who played Flor was Penelope Cruz but it was Paz Vega. They look so much alike its scary. This movie will most likely be one I will be adding to the DVD collection so I do recommend it.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Spanglish"" is a 7/10. A great couple movie which both can enjoy!",Spanglish
75,TheMovieMark,Better than I expected,7,17 December 2004,"PLOT Flor (Vega) emigrates to Los Angeles from Mexico in order to find a better life for her and her daughter, Cristina (Victoria Luna). She is hired by John and Deborah Clasky (Sandler and Leoni) as their housekeeper even though she can't speak a word of English. Faced with a language barrier, a daughter who is growing up faster than she'd like, and eccentric employers, Flor must find a way to adapt and keep her daughter grounded in reality. A surprisingly effective Adam Sandler dramatic turn ensues.JOHNNY'S TAKE Waterboy this ain't. For some that's a good thing, for others (as evidenced by the teenagers I saw leave the movie), it's a bad thing. For me? Hey, there's no doubt that I prefer a pure Adam Sandler comedy, but I can handle a dramatic turn like this every once in a while, especially if it's done well. This is definitely Sandler's attempt at trying something new, and while that may not appeal to his core fans, it just might help him find some new ones.The movie itself is a flashback. The narrator is Vega's daughter, and she's telling us the story of this period of her life because the events are what got her to where she is today.Here are the basics of what you need to know:* Vega is a better-looking version of Penelope Cruz who initially can't speak English. * Sandler is an excellent chef whose biggest fear is succeeding above that which he can handle. Plus, according to Vega, he has the ""emotions of a Mexican woman."" * Leoni is Sandler's somewhat crazy wife who hires Cruz to be their housekeeper. * Cloris Leachman is Leoni's alcoholic mother who badly wants to be able to offer motherly advice. * Children get involved and all Hades breaks loose. Everything builds upon those five points. How will everybody deal with Vega's inability to speak English? How will Sandler deal with the fact that his wife has hired a good-looking housekeeper with a loving, caring heart? Why does Leoni not realize how good of a husband she has, and will there be consequences to this? What happens when Vega's daughter moves into the house and Leoni gives her more attention than she does her own daughter?Tensions run high, and the cultural differences don't help. Leoni and Sandler try to give Cristine the things their children have, but Vega is resistant. She wants sole responsibility for raising her child and instilling values because she feels that's the only way to keep her from becoming something she isn't.But what happens when her daughter resents this and feels her mother is ruining her life? What happens when individuals begin to realize what and who is most important in their life? Will priorities change?This is the most vulnerable role Sandler has played, and I think a lot of women like that side of him. Not that I'm an expert on women's thoughts, but whenever I start talking to female friends about how hilarious it was when Sandler punched Bob Barker in Happy Gilmore, they usually prefer to talk about how sweet it was when he sang that ""Grow Old With You"" song to Drew Barrymore in The Wedding Singer. So it'll be no surprise if he wins a few hearts with the genuine affection he shows his children in this movie. And Leoni's bound to make a few enemies with the lack of affection she shows Sandler.But neither Sandler nor Leoni (who goes a tad over-the-top at times) is the real star here. That title has to go to Paz Vega. The acting is strong all around, but newcomer Vega really shines. I don't know how broad her appeal will be in future mainstream movies, but she was perfect for this.Spanglish isn't a perfect movie, and it certainly won't appeal to everyone. After all, some may find it a tad long and too dramatic for their taste. But the characters are developed just enough, and the story is crafted well enough, that I found myself interested in the relationships. I didn't mind the 2+ hour running time because I wanted to see how everything would end up. I must warn you that if you want a romantic movie that turns out EXACTLY like you want it to, then you could be disappointed. But you know, these characters feel real, the relationships feel real, and the result is realistic. Like in life, not all loose ends can be tied up within a 2-hour time frame.After the movie, Stephanie asked me, ""Why don't you say things like 'they need to name a gender after you' (which Sandler says in the movie)?"" I think she was mostly joking, but I replied, ""I've tried, but you'd just roll your eyes and tell me how gay that was."" She admitted that was true but said within the context of the movie with music playing in the background it's not so bad.I suppose she's right. And on a similar note, while Spanglish is a movie that can lay on the tears and the drama pretty thick, within the context of the story it's trying to tell, I'm man enough to admit that hey, it's not so bad. THE GIST If all you're looking for is an Adam Sandler comedy in the vein of Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, then you could be sorely disappointed. However, if you're really curious to see Sandler try his hand at a more dramatic, less mean-spirited role, and you don't mind a little chick flick drama that focuses heavily on character and story development, then you might find Spanglish to be a little better than you expect. Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)",Spanglish
76,seaview1,Spanglish is two movies in one,8,16 December 2004,"Adam Sandler returns to romantic comedy/drama in Spanglish, written and directed by James L. Brooks, who has fine tuned the genre with excellent scripts and sensitive acting (Terms of Endearment, As Good as It Gets). It doesn't quite measure up to his best work, but that's still saying something.Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni) hires a housekeeper/cook, Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), who doesn't speak English. Flor, a single mother, has a teenaged daughter, Cristina, and the two eventually move into a summer beach house with Leoni, her two kids, and husband, John Clasky (Adam Sandler), a world renowned chef. Deborah is a nervous, controlling type A personality, who has recently lost her job and begins to question her worth. Her subsequent actions such as lowering the self esteem of her overweight daughter, Bernice, and doting over Flor's daughter without mother's consent starts a sequence of events that pulls the two families apart and draw two frustrated, lonely people together, namely Sandler and Vega. They connect, of course, but what they do about it forms the focus of the storyline. At times this film thematically recalls classics like Roman Holiday or Brief Encounter.The film begins in such a manner to make one think that it isn't anything special but builds its story and characters into solid foundations until you begin to care about what happens. This is almost two films thematically. There is the developing love story between Sandler and Vega, and there is also the story of Vega, the mother, and her daughter. This is not just a family torn apart or a budding, forbidden romance, it is also the core mother-daughter dynamic seen though the teenaged daughters and their respective mothers. The narrative from Cristina's point of view recalls I Remember Mama. And let us not forget the relationship of Deborah and her own mother (Cloris Leachman-a Brooks alumnus from The Mary Tyler Moore Show). The ending is a bit open ended for one storyline while the other is resolved quite nicely.At times, the dialogue (a good portion is in Spanish and cleverly translated or communicated through context without subtitles) is crisp and sharp and other times, the story seems to tease without delivering and seemingly loses track until it gets reeled back by a brilliant line or two. Some of the situations seem a bit forced or going nowhere but Brooks has spoiled his audiences with his top flight writing over the years. It is remarkable that he can show lesser filmmakers how to write and construct a superior screenplay about people that an audience cares about. He makes stories about people that matter.Tea Leoni is good in her role as the neurotic housewife who becomes self absorbed. At times her character downright grates on the nerves, and you wonder how a man like Sandler's compassionate, loving husband/father, puts up with her behavior. Sandler does fine with his down-to-earth, dramatic role which contrasts with his quirky romantic in Punch Drunk Love. One wonders what a stronger persona like Brooks alumnus Jack Nicholson or even Tom Hanks would have done with his role. All the supporting roles are effective as usual. Leachman registers as the mother who consoles her adult daughter and is the voice of reason despite being the family alcoholic. Even the family dog becomes a small but noteworthy supporting character. There is also an amusing cameo by Thomas Haden Church who plays a character not unlike his more substantial role in Sideways.Production values are strong across the board particularly in the cinematography by John Seale. But it's really all about the writing and the acting. The film feels like it wants to be something more but settles for the quality of a moderate Brooks film like Broadcast News. The film will elicit laughs and some tears but it is consistently engaging. Wouldn't it be nice if more films could even reach that level of writing and acting? Is this a great film? No. It is merely a well written story, and that's pretty good on its own.",Spanglish
77,Bravesfan17,James L. Brooks works wonders,7,21 May 2010,"Writer-director-producer James L. Brooks movies are good, interesting, and he knows how to let his characters develop. Brooks has always worked amazingly with his leading actresses. Paz Vega is no exception as she is amazing in her first leading role in an American movie. She plays Flor, a housekeeper who is hired for the summer by the Claskys, played by Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni. Vega shows that she can be funny and dramatic and do it just right without pushing it. She shows some brilliance in working with an American script.Adam Sandler is great in what is more of a supporting role as John Clasky, a chef who is obsessed with being a good enough without raising the bar. Sandler is much more laid back and shows that he can do some good acting when the comedy and drama are mixed just right. Brooks shows us that he can have a good Adam Sandler performance without Adam Sandler being himself.Tea Leoni shows some good acting chops as Sandler's lost and confused housewife. She is good in this role and shows that she can do good work as an actress. Cloris Leachman is brilliant as Leoni's mother who provides the voice of reason for her. Leachman is also funny at times.James L. Brooks knows how to write and direct brilliantly to tell the story that he wants to tell. Brooks knows how to transition from scene to scene and have the transitions set up smoothly. Brooks is also great at directing his actors to get the performances that he wants.",Spanglish
78,jrfranklin01,Surprising All Around,7,24 May 2005,"First of all, let me say the title alone had me expecting some sort of farce or comedy obviously relating to language barriers. I was also expecting the film to be a little bit insulting to the Spanish language (the word Spanglish often seems used that way). With Adam Sandler cast as a lead, it seemed my suspicions would all but be realized. Boy was I wrong.Spanglish takes everything you presume to know about the film and its actors and turns things around entirely. It shows that Adam Sandler can really act in more than just the goofy, silly man roles. It also shows that a slang word often used to describe our inabilities to communicate with other people can actually encompass and define quite a bit more.Adam Sandler play upscale chef John Clasky, who with his wife (Tea Leoni) and children, live in a domestic madhouse. When they hire a new maid, Flor (Paz Vega), everyone's life is affected. Since Flor cannot speak any English and the Clasky's cannot speak Spanish, this makes for an odd arrangement indeed. Add Paz's daughter to the mix (in a giant live-in relationship), a wealthy lifestyle, adultery, weight insecurities, and alcoholism......and you get a whirlwind of problems that, in the end, speak deeper than what their surface shows. This is a chick-flick but also a great movie guys can enjoy. It's not really a film where anyone really wins or loses, but more of story about what happens to different people, how they come to be, and where they are going, regardless of what language they speak. 7/10",Spanglish
79,jaxbubba,Wait for the Video,4,16 April 2005,"This is your typical James L. Brooks film, which you could commonly classify as your average chick flick (The Word Spy - chick flick). The film features Adam Sandler, Téa Leoni, Paz Vega, and Cloris Leachman (who I just love in this film).The movie follows the lives of Flor Moreno (Vega) and her daughter Christina. The film is the retelling of the events which lead to the opening sequence of the movie, the reading of Christina's application letter to Princeton. As we learn very early on in this film, Flor is a single parent, bound and determined to provide a better way of life for her daughter. Subsequently, Flor decides to flee Mexico, with her daughter along side, to find the American Dream in Los Angeles. With help from her cousin, she is able to land a housekeeping position with an upper income family, the Clasky's. It's Flor's employment with John and Deborah Clasky (Sandler and Leoni), that the film focuses.This film has all the elements that you want and need for this type of film to work; however, it just falls short of making you care about any of these individuals. There's your successful chef (John) who wishes to be not as successful, your cheating spouse (Deborah), your alcoholic mother (Evelyn), the ever-caring housekeeper (Flor) and her always thankful daughter (Christina); but somehow the events being presented are just a compilation of stories strung together. We know that John loves his family and makes every attempt to be there for them (even giving up interest in his restaurant in order to be home more), but his wife is still able to have an extra-marital affair. We are told that Flor loves the Clasky children; however, we are presented with only the clothes alteration story as proof. Finally, the ""I love you"" scene at the end of the film is just totally off base, and comes out of nowhere.If you are looking for your typical Adam Sandler Film, you're not going to find it in this film. And though this is not one of James Brooks' better productions, it's not horrendous.http://farisreel.com",Spanglish
80,pswanson00,well done,8,27 August 2005,"I rented this long after I forgot why I wanted to, and was not disappointed (I must've read a positive review when it was released). One of the things I love is the film's portrayal of people who come to have a strong mutual attraction without immediately having them drop their drawers and climb into the sack. The characters are adults, dealing with life's challenges in an adult manner (meaning sometimes having feelings without acting upon them). This is the only Adam Sandler movie which I can recall having the stomach to watch, and I thought he was quite good, if a bit understated. Of course, compared to Tea Leoni's characterization, I guess anyone would look understated. I'd never heard of Paz Vega, and she is fabulous, as well as breathtakingly beautiful. Cloris Leachman is, as ever, the consummate pro, and steals most of her scenes. The surprise standout for me is Shelbie Bruce. If this kid can avoid the pitfalls of Life As A Child Actor she will have a long, distinguished career. The scene in which she translates simultaneously both sides of a conversation, speaking one side as if for her mother, is a priceless film moment. This is a film about and for real people, and adult people at that. I love it, and will see it again.",Spanglish
81,FilmSnobby,Dreary exercise in White Guilt.,2,4 December 2005,"Anybody can have an off-day, but it's hard to believe that the man responsible for such classic comedies of manners as *Broadcast News* and (to a somewhat lesser extent) *As Good as It Gets* would go on to make *Spanglish*. James L. Brooks' latest film is not so much a comedy of manners as it is a situation comedy for TV, stretched out to faux-epic proportions for the big screen. The characters are TV caricatures, not real people. Adam Sandler plays an L.A.-area haute-cuisine chef whom one critic dubs ""the greatest chef in America""; Tea Leone as his wife is a neurotic spastic, incessantly shooting her mouth off, incessantly jogging, etc. (in other words, the clichéd version of the southern Californian well-to-do hausfrau); Cloris Leachman plays Leone's mildly alcoholic mother, a former jazz singer and one of those ""quirky"" people who exist only in movies and middle-brow fiction with literary pretensions; and newcomer Paz Vega plays the beautiful and saintly Mexican maid with an equally beautiful and saintly daughter.One might add the qualifying adjective ""improbably"" to beautiful and saintly. The movie is a dreary exercise in White Guilt: the wealthy and white Clasky family owns the monopoly on petty neuroses, here. Even their kids are screwed up: the pubescent daughter is slightly overweight, which wouldn't be half the problem it is if her own mother would stop reminding her of it; the younger son is apparently plagued with nightmares, but we're not sure exactly why, and in any case the movie sort of forgets about the little bugger for long stretches. Meanwhile, no one in the house seems to resent the perfection of the live-in maid Flor, with her grounded family values, her eye-popping beauty (Vega is a ringer for Penelope Cruz, but without that actress' supermodel hard edges), and her sweet temper, all of which is contrasted against Leone's bratty, self-centered, adulterous, and physically unlovely character. (Brooks makes the poor woman drip snot from her nose for the last twenty minutes of the film, while the heavenly, marmoreal Vega consummates a sweetly platonic love affair with Sandler.) Even the movie's framing device, the Longest Admissions Essay In History that Flor's daughter writes to Princeton, seems like a stacked deck. Since, at film's end, Vega removes her kid from the tony private school that Leone puts her in, we may assume that the girl achieved singular, unparalleled academic brilliance in the gritty public schools of the barrio. How heartwarming!Counterintuitively, the movie dances around, rather than engages head-on, the issues of class and race in American society. For instance, the Claskys pay Flor $650 a week, if I heard correctly. What a load. $650 every TWO weeks is a more realistic going-rate for undocumented housekeepers in the wealthier enclaves of southern California, and THAT figure is probably still too high. Oh, but that's right, Flor and her daughter are apparently LEGAL immigrants -- presumably, Leone cuts her maid checks which are deposited in a bank somewhere, instead of handing her cash under the table. As a lifelong southern Californian, forgive my skepticism. (If the movie informed us that Flor was undocumented, I must've missed it when I went to the kitchen to get some coffee, and I'll stand corrected if that's the case.) Clearly, insisting that the film honestly depict the uneasy relationships between rich white people and the Hispanic ""hired help"" may be asking too much.Which leaves only the various character studies. I've already talked about the women, but I can't finish the review without mentioning the inadequacy of Adam Sandler. Mr. Sandler is not ready for Prime Time. Tentative, hiding behind mannerisms, clearly not directed by Brooks (what -- would YOU tell Sandler, one of the most powerful celebrities in Hollywood, how to act?), he is the person in the film who doesn't know how to speak English. He strangles his dialog with unnecessary dramatic pauses, open-mouthed staring, and a lot of casting hopelessly about in general. Vega Paz is more clearly understood, and she doesn't speak a word of English for the first half of the movie. If Sandler wants to emulate the Saturday Night Live alumni of yore with extending his range as an actor, he'd be well served by doing some Ibsen and the like for a few years with an acting troupe. Since he lacks the depth of natural talent that a Bill Murray or a Steve Martin was blessed with, a lot of hard work -- practice, practice, practice -- is required in order for him to attain the credibility of his predecessors in terms of dramatic roles. When, for instance, Leone informs him of her adultery, Sandler's reaction is cringe-worthy -- he clearly has no idea how to perform the scene. These comments are not as unkind as they might seem. Sandler may be a decent actor someday, but he's not remotely there yet, and someone needs to tell him that -- otherwise, he'll continue to waste his time and our money.2 stars out of 10.

82,Snowgo,"Offensive, Non-sensical",4,23 March 2019,"I found almost nothing that worked well in this film. For one thing, someone who comes to this country illegally is not an ""immigrant"".., they are an illegal alien. They way the movie trivializes this crime is just the first indication that there is an elitist subtext to Spanglish.
When Flora comes to the Clasky's house, she needs an interpreter. This is ridiculous that no one in the household was able to communicate with her. When the wife starts yelling at her about the dog's ball, I felt an insanity regarding this movie. Why would someone yell at someone else who does not understand them?
Then, when the cook, himself, starts going off on Flora in the car (so generously driving her to the ""bus station""), I felt so sorry for this nice person that I took the DVD out of my machine and threw it in the trash. Other problems I had with this movie was the fact that a cook does not earn enough to be considered ""high-class"". The daughter took me aback by her unusual approach to glamor. Yikes. What kind of statement was Spanglish trying to make? All I could make out of it was a dis-functional, middle-class family, disguising itself as rich and therefore feeling entitled to toy with and abuse the help, both at home and in the restaurant.

83,gcrokus,"Iffy Start, Great Closer",8,11 January 2005,"""Spanglish"" must be one of the slowest starting movies in recent memory. No one walked out in the showing we attended, but it would not surprise us to find some theaters had lost viewers early on. But in truth if one can get past the early moments the payoff is large.Primarily the problem with the opener is that it is about false notes  the early interview involving Deborah Clasky (Tea Leoni)  wife of successful chef John (Adam Sandler) - with housekeeper Flor (Paz Vega) and daughter puts one off. It seems that Ms. Leoni is overacting; or, to put it less kindly, she is off-putting. She eventually sets things straight and becomes one of the more interesting characters, so ""Spanglish"" rights itself shortly, and from that point on is compelling viewing.Once Flor is hired, she inserts herself (despite her inability to speak English) into the world of the Clasky's. Mrs. Clasky is a fiercely Type A personality but her husband is a more sensitive and sensible character. As Flor observes the behavior of each family member, and in particular the manic and domineering character Mrs. Clasky is - she begins to wonder why Sandler just seems to take it (""he never does anything""). Raised in ultra-macho Mexico, Flor has not seen such behavior before - at least not in men.Deborah lashes out at all, and all give good performances; her mother (Cloris Leachman), her daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) and her husband, and we cannot help but feel she is confronting her personal demons. And of course Flor and her daughter prominently figure on her personal radar screen. Paz Vega (Flor) has, by the way, a very attractive screen presence. But as good as the supporting cast may be it is Sandler we are really watching.Sandler: Coming home in a very drunken state (watch him grasp for some wind chimes and potted plants for support); listen to him stumble  as we might  through confrontations with his daughter, with Flor, with his wife and even with his colleagues at work. Sandler is getting very good at demonstrating a quiet vulnerability but spices it with enough unexpected expostulations that he keeps us off guard. Of his star, director James L. Brooks said: ""Because what he has - first of all he has a comic persona which I really wanted and he's a great regular looking guy that you believe, which I really wanted."" (http://www.darkhorizons.com/news04/spang2.php).This movie succeeds because of all the small things. We really fall into the cinema-spell good scripts usually cast upon us. That by way of saying there is enough good dialog to keep us in our seats as we determine to see just where this story might go. It is interesting that on the Tomatometer ""Spanglish"" only earns a 50%. But we know instinctively these are the movies to see  how can critics be perfectly divided in their opinions? And perhaps this study of multi-culturism in Southern California has a bit of the Hollywood touch, but Brooks' closing moment (heart-stoppingly perfect) is a paean for mothers and daughters.Rating: 3  ¼ Stars.",Spanglish

85,colonel_green,The final moments threaten to sink the whole production.,5,18 December 2004,"This is a very well-made film, acted superbly by Tea Leoni, Adam Sandler, Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, Shelbie Bruce, and Sarah Steele. The characters are all distinct and interesting, and there are more than a few worthy dialogues. The plot concerns a Mexican maid and her daughter's interactions with the family that the maid works for. There are several subplots going on, such as the tug-of-war between the maid and the lady of the house over the maid's daughter, and the flirtation between the maid and the man of the house. Up until the ending, the film was doing fine, and would have rated perhaps an 8. But then the film has the maid (Vega) make a horrible decision with regards to her daughter's future, and the film promotes it as good and proper. In doing what she did, Vega's character might very well have condemned her daughter to life in a ghetto; but, perhaps it would be best for her to live in a Mexican-American ghetto, since she'll stay true to her culture (which doesn't appear to consist of anything beyond speaking Spanish). Who cares whether little Cristina (Bruce) goes to a better school and gets a better education; she can just be a maid like her mom and live her whole life in the barrio.",Spanglish
86,Derek237,Never really comes full circle,9,5 January 2005,"For all that it is, I liked Spanglish very much. But I don't think it was as good as it could have been. My problem with it is that it sort of unfairly focuses on the characters of Flor and her daughter. Their story jumps into the middle of another story and then leaves at its own convenience. I really became attached to the Clasky family characters (which includes Adam Sander and Tea Leoni) and I was deeply involved in their whole story, but then by the end, it completely stops short. There were many conflicts that were resolved on Flor's side, but we see nothing of what happens with the Clasky family. I was left wanting more, and not in a good way-- In fact, in the worst way possible. So, to those who say that Spanglish is about the mixing of two stories I'd have to say that it isn't: it's the mixing of one story into another. The stories do not get equal share of the movie and what it stands for.All of what I just mentioned is a huge flaw, but still there's plenty of good things to day about the movie. It's James L. Brooks behind the camera here, so obviously there is a lot of humour and a sincere sweetness to it. There was not a single character that I didn't love. Tea Leoni never really caught my eye before but she has now for sure. Hers was my favourite performance and I hope she gets an Oscar nomination (or something!!) for best supporting actress. Sandler is also great in a role that finally suits him as something other than a complete maniac. Paz Vega was also a joy to watch and also deserves awards attention. And, of course, I have never seen better child acting than I have here.Okay, it has its flaws which, even though I really liked the movie, I just can't forgive, but it shouldn't stop anyone from going to see it. It's just a little short of being perfect but I love it anyway.My rating: 9/10",Spanglish
87,flickershows,Jim Brooks' Pointless Return To Directing,4,2 January 2005,"'Spanglish' is this year's 'Something's Gotta Give'...an exasperating ""character"" piece about love, life lessons, and various nonsense. I was surprised by just how inept and clunky this latest James L. Brooks movie is. He's directed only 5 films in 21 years...and 'Spanglish' is clearly his worst. In fact, I can't see what inspired him to write or direct such an aimless project in the first place, unless the whole sensible-Spanish-maid-in-a-nutso-house-of-rich-white-people dynamic happened to him in real life.Paz Vega is that gorgeous maid, a woman who has brought her daughter from Mexico to So-Cal. Vega is hired by a well-to-do family, who have the kind of problems Dr. Phil would kill to misdiagnose. Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni co-star as the unhappily married John and Deborah Clasky, the parents of 2 kids and 1 dog. Cloris Leachman is Leoni's oft-soused mother and a one-woman Greek chorus. The language barrier---Vega speaks no English, the Clasky's speak no Spanish---is cause for forced laughs until the fiery domestic goddess decides to learn some passable English. Other stuff happens and I struggled to care.The actors. Paz Vega might become a major player now. She's certainly beautiful enough to be a movie star. Sandler is likable in these dramedy roles, although his performance in 'Spanglish' is a little shapeless. As the patient dad and husband, he's a prince. He's also edge-free and even a bit dull. Leachman's best lines are all in the trailer (they're not very funny in the movie itself), but she does give the film a kick.As for the other actors...well, rumour has it, the Clasky's have a boy too. Maybe that's just a rumour. The 2 daughters are the best things in the movie. Okay, it goes like this---Paz Vega's curves, then the girls. But Tea Leoni is nothing short of brutal. She high-maintenances her way right out of the picture. There are annoying people just like this irritating women in the world...and they should never be portrayed on the movie screen again. She's a good actress in a terrible role.Nothing in 'Spanglish' ever gels. No lines are worth quoting and it goes on way too long. Brooks has had the golden touch for so long. Has he lost it? If so, he's not the only aging director who (apparently) has nothing left to say.",Spanglish
88,Boggman,Spanglish hits it's mark.....,6,10 June 2005,"This is a good film worth watching at least once. Good example of different ethnicities learning to work together. The film moves at a steady pace, has some charming comedic moments, and is overall enjoyable. Won't give the story away, but I do recommend this film for it's light hearted comedy and excellent performances. Tea Leoni is quite exceptional, and Penelope Cruz look-a-like Paz Vega shows promise as an up and comer. Sandler has some funny moments as well, but his role is less comedy and more dramatic. The children in this film are also quite talented young actors, with special mention going to Shelbie Bruce (Christina) & Sarah Steele (Bernice) for their heartfelt performances. Cloris Leachman is quite funny as the mother Evelyn Norwich. While Vega is enjoyable and quite convincing as Flor Moreno, this is really Tea Leoni's film. She pretty much steals the show as neurotic, newly minted housewife Deborah Clasky. It's becomes quite clear while watching, that she really threw herself into the role.Check it out if you get a chance! Probably a better rental than an addition to your DVD collection, however, as with all reviews....that is just a matter of my personal opinion. ;-)",Spanglish
89,dskywalker0,Kinda predictable.,5,16 August 2021,"The acting is on point and the story plays out in a format we don't usually see in films of the genre, but it's a product of its time - nowadays it's a bit of a cliché. It has its funny moments and still portrays important issues of American-cultured relationships, specifically their relationships with immigrants in the early 2000's, but it turns out to be quite unimpressive - I don't think I'd admit the girl into her school of choice based on the essay after all.",Spanglish
90,miken-3,Excellent!,9,24 January 2005,"This is one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in the past year! It focuses on a single Mexican mother (Flor), who is trying to raise her daughter by working two jobs. When she realizes that she needs to spend more time with her daughter, she talks to a friend about helping her find a job that pays at least the combined salary of her two jobs.The friend takes her to the home of a wealthy couple to be a housekeeper/nanny. This is a major change for her because since she came to the US, she has not ventured outside the LA Mexican barrio. On top of that Flor speaks zero English and the family for whom she will work for speaks no Spanish.Flor also learns fast that the wealthy mother is a control freak and her restaurant owner/master chef husband (Adam Sandler) is a wimp. The daughter is a sweet girl but badly treated by her mother because she is overweight and not ""perfect"" in her studies. Flor develops a bond with the daughter and when Flor is forced to bring her own daughter to live with the family, Flor bonds with Sandler because they both have very strong ties to their daughters.This movie seemed to be a tear-jerker for most of the female patrons that I saw at the theater and was a very enjoyable, fun movie for all the males. The actress who plays Flor's daughter looks like a comer, who will be a big star someday!",Spanglish

The pace is annoyingly slow but I suffered through it.",Spanglish
92,jantoniou,"A great, understated charm of a film",8,27 April 2005,"""Spanglish"" is fundamentally a movie about family--in this case, two families coming together to explore, exploit, and explode the dysfunction writhing quite palpably just beneath the surface--or just plainly in view. The ""Spanish"" part of ""Spanglish"" is the ironic presence of Flor, a Mexican beauty hired ostensibly to be a house cleaner, but she becomes more a wife and a mother than Leoni's spastically neurotic Deborah, an anal-retentive over-achiever who, after being abruptly booted from her career, is now saddled with the reality that she must now finally, in fact, be a wife and a mother. Flor is hired--unconsciously, of course--to be a surrogate to the household. Sandler has toned down--way down--for his role as Deborah's wildly successful chef-husband, John. His pitch is nearly perfect to deliver John's often brilliant lines as a sympathetic, seemingly ideal thoughtful father-/husband-foil to Deborah's general far extreme self-centered manic whacko. John is a center but, among the story arcs, he still revolves around Flor, the truest axis for this movie. In fact, all arcs point to her and John's shared love. ------- spoiler --------- As much as I truly enjoyed this movie--clever and thoughtful dialogue-driven movies are an exceptional rarity these days--I am often puzzled by the kind of storytelling that relies on adultery--or, in this case, both the reality and the implication of it, to give it its emotional core. John is setup from the word go to fall madly in love with Flor and his calm brilliance and thoughtfulness are pure bait even for the exceptional Flor. They seem ""made for each other"" - yet we know they cannot be together even as they dance around each other and turn the movie upon its axis.Deborah's act of contrition at the end of the movie, while perhaps true and heart-felt, seems limp next to Flor and John's love for each other. It's not nearly as emotionally convincing simply because Brooks gave so much weight to John and Flor's relationship. It's clear Deborah is a horrible wife and mother--and let's face it how much of the movie can safely be focused on a ""horrible"" person? Yet, her emotional transformation is barely scratched upon and this makes her willingness to change seem vague and hollow. In the end, we almost prefer her as a nutso and would certainly rather see John and Flor ride off into the sunset. Flor's presence is not supposed to be ""easy,"" and all parties have to carry on with their lives in spite of each other, but, while I really enjoyed ""Spanglish"" as a well-executed ""Romantic Comedy,"" I cannot help but be disconcerted that the romance is centered around adultery and not reconciliation between husband and wife.",Spanglish
93,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Spanglish,4,18 December 2004,"It's the most wonderful time of the year! True, the Christmas season is upon us but more importantly to the Hollywood left, who could giving a flying-hoot about a Christian based holiday, it is the season of giving and rewarding themselves. That is correct, it is award season! Though the nominations for the Golden Globes have already been handed out, there is still plenty of time for those last-minute additions to the 2004 film schedule to make an impact on the most prestigious award ceremony of the year, the 77th Annual Academy Awards. And who better to vie for the coveted spot on the nominations list then James L. Brooks, the man who creates the romantic comedies the Motion Picture Association can not help but eat up, no matter how gooey and clichéd they may be to some. This has yet been another light-weight year when it comes to award-worthy presentations  it is so hard without Lord of the Rings, is it not  and Spanglish, despite some rather negative buzz early on, may still yet be able to stir up some noise come this January.The story follows the events of an immigrant woman's life as she and her new daughter adjust to their new surrounds after moving to the United States from Mexico. Flor Moreno, a beautiful native Mexican woman left by her husband to raise her maturing daughter alone, makes the difficult decision to immigrate, illegally of course, to the United States for a better life for her small family. After entering the country, she and her young daughter make the long bus trek from Texas to southern California, moving in with her cousin in a heavily Hispanic ghetto. Concerned about her daughter Cristina's budding femininity, Flor decides to scope out a position as a housekeeper and is hired by John and Deborah Clasky who live in an affluent white neighborhood. John is a rising star in the culinary world and racked with the thought of Time magazine coming to his restaurant to review his work. He fears success, believing that if he receives four stars the only way to go is down and with the increasing attendance at his hot new restaurant that will mean less time spent with the family. Deborah, a former working woman, feels trapped as a stay-at-home mother, constantly battling with John for the good/bad guy parent position when it comes to rearing their children, usually receiving the latter. As cultures, traditions, values, and languages clash between Flor and her newly adopted American family, life changing lessons on marriage, parenting, love, friendship and family are learned on both sides. The story for Spanglish instantly becomes lost in translation, certainly no pun intended toward the vastly superior Academy-Award winning screenplay, lacking what matters to a film above all else  consistency, direction, style and heart. All of these troubling revelations become all the more difficult to swallow when one fathoms this rather dull, forlorn, and acutely humorless presentation is from the mind of James L. Brooks, the man behind such romantic comedy classics as As Good As It Gets and Terms of Endearment. No need to fret though. Even the best of directors in Hollywood have their off days and this seems to be the year for it with M. Night Shyamalan's The Village and Steven Spielberg's The Terminal being prime examples of this theory.It is revolting to see so many talented performers as there here have their respected gifts wasted like this, among them all Adam Sandler should stand out prominently in anybody's mind. Sandler, hardly a stranger to the dramatic comedy after astounding critics in his high-praised performance in Punch-Drunk Love, comes off as being intensely under-utilized in this film. He works out fabulously in the role and there appears to be quite some chemistry in his conversations with Pez Vega, especially when he opens up to her emotionally expressing what he can not say to his own wife whose perfectionist nature leaves no room to appear weak. Sadly, quantities of these sequences are limited and the audience never receives the full picture on John Clasky. In the end, instead of feeling happy for him, the audience leaves feeling sorry for the fact that the only woman he has ever felt a real connection with  not mere sexual attraction but emotional closeness as well  is leaving his life possibly forever and he is stuck with a woman that after a decade or so of marriage is just beginning to come around appreciating how good of a man he is, if only due to the enforcement of her alcoholic mother. Poor Téa Leoni! Her genuine and engaging performance as the perfectionist stay-at-home mother, Deborah Clasky, is so unfortunately wasted in this film. Deborah is so atrociously neurotic and undignified, even going so far as to border on the line of being flat-out insolent, the audience leaves the film wishing John Clasky would just divorce her and save the rest of the family the trouble of having to deal with her a moment longer. It's fantastic to see that Brooks is able to deliver such an absurd and retched character as Deborah, leaving the audience hating her guts with every compulsive move she makes, but the problem lies in the fact that he strips her of so much that there is no redeeming quality left about her to gain the respect of the viewers, let alone her husband, at the end of the film. And, furthermore, what is Brooks attempting to say with Deborah? What is with Hollywood and their inane belief that every woman who free-willing gives up her job in the workforce to be a stay-at-home mother falls into a deep and secluded depression, thus leading her to dabble into a sexual affair with another man? Paz Vega is positively illuminating as Flor Moreno, catching the audience's eye every time she appears on screen but, as painful as this is to say, that is as far as Brooks' direction, maybe even his script, allows her to be. There is hardly a quality or action about her that marks Flor distinguishable above the rest of the cast of characters outside the fact of being the only one that is rather dull and bland, based solely on actions rather then appearances. It may be the whole language barrier that fails the audience in connecting with her on an emotional level but considering John Clasky is able to somewhere in there, it is hard to believe that that is entirely the problem. This may once again be a direct result of James Brooks' poorly crafted and executed screenplay, which fails in its attempts to grab hold of a singular message and run with it to the end. And, yes, Ian Hyland does receive credit for the role of the Clasky son Georgie despite the clear and overt fact that he never once states more then a few words, beyond the realm of show-tunes with his grandmother, throughout the entire film. Hey, John and Deborah  when you're done dealing with your weight conscious daughter and your own marital complications, remember that you have a son somewhere in that household of yours.Overall, linguistic complexities being the least of their problems, Spanglish's audience is in desperate need of its own translator in order to decipher amongst the garbled mesh of clichéd cuteness and bland one-liners rattled off as deep philosophical thinking the message the film is attempting to express. The film certainly enjoys hedging its bets early and often, only to lose big-time when all was said and done. Does Brooks truly expect us to believe that such a sophomoric essay theme as 'Who do you admire most?' would appear on the application form for such a prestigious education institution as Princeton? And this is captured in the opening sequence of the film! On top of this, Spanglish's script, or what exists of one, sends confusing and complicated messages to the audience, none of which are ever clearly stated, let alone backed up with sufficient evidence to prove its point. Does this mean that every child who attends a private educational institution will lose his/her independence and identity? Every stay-at-home mother finds herself so entrenched in depression that the only way she can escape is by having a sexual affair with another man? And every illegal Hispanic immigrant who drops out of a private education and remains stranded in the public education sector of the state of California who sends in his/her essay to Princeton University will have it examined intensely for the sake of their own merit and not merely for the unethical method of affirmative action? And what is more insulting is that the actions of the film are excruciatingly bland and static. There is not a moment of real humor in the beginning of the film until about twenty or so minutes into the presentation. From there the jokes are few and far between and are usually aimed at the language barriers of the two illegal Mexican immigrants. There are so few actually gracious recommendations that can be made about this film that to list the meager amount that do exist would stray away from the undeniable fact that Spanglish is yet another tremendous disappointment this year from a respected filmmaker. Also, when escaping from the bottom rung of society in a country such as Mexico, screw the heritage bull-crap and assimilate quickly  everyone will be better off for it.My Rating: ** out of 5 (Grade: D)",Spanglish
94,RARubin,Tia and Cloris Steal Show,7,13 June 2005,"This is a sweet film, not exactly realistic; everyone seems to be a little too much on type. Now I did not say everyone was stereotyped, just actors playing a type. Cloris Leachman is the drunken mother ignored by her striving, seemingly perfect daughter, Tea Leoni. Adam Sandler plays, er Adam Sandler, a successful, quirky, restrained Jewish guy. Paz Vega is smart, wise, Mexican, immigrant, and poor housekeeper to Sandler's two kids and cloying, controlling wife. Flour's daughter out of wedlock (How did that happen to such a wise woman?) takes the unhappy rich family under her wings as much as the language barrier will bear. That is it. Sandler is unhappy with narcissistic Leoni and well he should be. He pouts and grovels. Gradually he comes to appreciate Vega as the counterpoint to his neurotic wife.I commend Sandler's attempt to move on from his dopey caricature, his screwball, gross-out roles. I am thinking of the underrated, Punch Drunk Love, when I say he's going adult in comedy or drama situations. Keep trying Adam. Someday you will be real.",Spanglish
95,kellyadmirer,What a Boring Movie,2,24 December 2004,"I can't believe how dull this movie was. I don't review a film based on a movie's good intentions or uplifting themes, I review its entertainment value. Yes, it is wonderful they can make a movie about the illegal-immigrant experience, especially one that is so light-hearted about it. But while ""Spanglish"" did have some value, it felt like sitting through the Spanish Inquisition waiting for that value to appear.I don't understand how this film was made. All I can think is that Adam Sandler is on the whole comic-fancies-himself-Olivier kick that sends more careers into the ditch than anything else. If you are Jerry Lewis, be Jerry Lewis! At least be the Jerry Lewis before Jerry became all serious and went into eclipse until ""The King of Comedy"" came out. There's nothing wrong with being a funny Jerry Lewis, Adam, the French love him, and he is a legend. Why did Jim Carrey have to make ""The Majestic""? Why did Bill Murray have to re-make ""The Razor's Edge""? Why did Jerry Lewis have to make that lost movie about the clown in the concentration camp? Adam, give it up before it is too late! The others did! Tea Leoni has ""desperate over-acting"" written all over her performance. At least that balances the absolutely stupefying under-acting of Paz Vega. I lost count of the reaction shots of Vega looking quizzical, or looking lost, or just looking blank. To draw a comparison, Peter Sellers perfected the art of giving a great performance by giving blank looks in ""Being There."" This is no ""Being There."" A film based on dynamic personal relationships utterly collapses when the central character is an emotional cipher. Even at the end, when there is finally some bonding going on and a strong emotion might actually pull this film out of the ash heap, the Vega character just jumps up like a frightened chicken and runs out of the restaurant. Wonderful.What actually happens in this film? Not much. Adam Sandler goes around mumbling ""You're great, you're great, I love you"" and such, acting like he drank too much wine back at the restaurant he runs. There is so much mellow Southern-Californian dialogue, especially from him, that it really gets distracting. There is no resolution, and darn little complication. Basically the movie has a chance to turn into a hit-piece on the Leoni character, but then pulls its punches and tries to make her somewhat sympathetic in an evil-stepmother-got-her-comeuppance-and-now-is-pathetic kind of way. I guess showing some real emotion about anything was too much for the screenwriters.To give an indication how messed up the screenplay is, Leoni and Sandler have a son who appears briefly at the beginning, then gets kind of lost, then reappears briefly at the end, with no explanation or exposition. And this despite the fact that half the movie is set in a tiny beach house where everyone is staying. He's like Richie Cunningham's basketball-dribbling brother in ""Happy Days"" who disappeared in like the third episode. Only this kid reappears in a tearful ""bye bye"" scene that sort of comes out of nowhere, considering we never learned anything about the kid or developed any emotional attachment to him.I found the Sarah Steele daughter character utterly annoying, acting the way a 35-year-old Hollywood screenwriter would act rather than the way an actual teenager would. ""Excuse me, I need a moment."" Yeah, sure.Cloris Leachman actually gives a professional performance, but she is over-used. I'm thinking that whoever edited this turkey finally saw her class performance after shooting was completed and kept as much of her in the movie as humanly possible. But she is a peripheral character, and every second devoted to her detracts from the actual unfolding of the plot, what plot there is.I am not an Adam Sandler fanatic. I actually don't like his comedies that much, with a couple of exceptions, so I am not in the ""attended expecting the wrong type of Sandler film"" crowd. I simply found this film a trial to sit through.",Spanglish
96,el_monty_BCN,No funciona - It just doesn't work,2,26 February 2005,"I had moderately high expectations for this movie. I am Spanish, and since Paz Vega has rapidly become in the last few years one of my country's most popular actresses, I couldn't help but wish that her jump to Hollywood would be successful. Also, the name of James L. Brooks suggested quality. This is a man who doesn't make films often, his fame being grounded mostly on his TV shows, so when he does, one tends to believe it's because he really has something to say.Sadly, the result of my expectation has been crushing disappointment, for this film fails at so many levels that I couldn't find anything to keep me interested. Brooks's direction, for example, seemed to me amazingly clumsy and lacking in rhythm. Often you had the impression that the camera lingered too long on the actors, and they didn't know what to say, what to do or even where to stand. Sandler, again surprisingly, was the only one to exercise restraint in his performance, in between Leoni's and Vega's terrible overacting; both of them exaggerated their gestures so much you would think they were in a children's play by adults (Actually, it seemed to me the children in the movie were acting much better than them, especially Steele, who plays Sandler's daughter with disarming charm). Then again, good acting is not easy to achieve with a script this terrible: The dialog felt sometimes so fake that you could see them make efforts to sound half believable; the characters were hardly developed or made almost cartoonish (Deb, Tea Leoni's psychotic bundle of nerves of a wife would be the prime example); the situations often didn't make sense (Flor's attitude of fear and disdain towards Deb is completely beyond reason, even to the point of bigotry. Deb may be a neurotic, but Flor has good reason to be very grateful to her); subplots branched out in several directions but never really went anywhere; and the big plot, the development of the romantic spark between the protagonists, felt rushed and unrealistic and I simply could not believe a word of it. I just managed to bear the movie as it got worse and worse and was thankful when it ended, which is when I realized that it didn't just feel long to me; it's also that the thing is way too long! Thumbs down to Brooks then, and better luck to Paz next time, I hope this mistake doesn't stop her rise to stardom.",Spanglish
97,sethmlanders,6.5 is being way too generous!,4,7 February 2016,"So much is wrong with this movie and I don't blame the cast because they all did a good job, it's the script that bothers me. Going into this, I expected it to be one of those non-formula Sandler pictures (no fart jokes, frequent outbursts, Rob Schneider, etc.) and what I got instead was a convoluted mess with a terrible ending. I have no issues with the guy doing dramatic roles but this didn't work in the slightest. Plus, the algorithm is messed up. Why is this turd of a film rated a 6.5???!!Adam Sandler plays a chef at a restaurant and his wife is an absolute psychopath. I'm not trying to be harsh but her character is a gold digging mooch of a whore. If I was in his shoes, I would have dumped the bitch around the 80-90 minute mark. This Paz Vega is gorgeous and she gives a decent performance.What I didn't like about this is how overlong it is and how things don't get resolved. I'm not saying make the movie short or resolve everything, but at least put more effort into it than this. You're praying that Sandler finally kicks out his ditsy wife and gets with Vega but that never happens. The biggest issue with Adam Sandler's character in this movie is that he's too much of a coward. There's a scene where he yells, ""I QUIT THIS JOB TOO!"" and yet does nothing about it. I'm trying not to spoil anything but the ending was so frustrating that I asked myself why I wasted two hours of my life on this junk.Avoid this garbage, this gets a 4 out of 10.",Spanglish
98,mfisher452,A refreshing look at the clash of cultures,7,11 May 2005,"Many of the IMDb's reviewers of this film are quite perceptive about this film and furthermore have much more perspective on the rest of James L. Brooks's work than I do. Judging this film essentially on its own merits, I was entertained but not quite satisfied by Spanglish.The story is told in narrative flashback by Cristina Moreno (Shelbie Bruce), the daughter of Flor Moreno, a Mexican woman. The exposition of the plot immediately puts at least a mild strain on credulity: Flor (Paz Vega) and Cristina are abandoned by Flor's husband. Who would leave this gorgeous, sensuous, sensible woman? Oh, well, I suppose it happens. Flor and Cristina move to Southern California where they have family. Despite speaking no English, Flor finds a job with the Clasky family: John (Adam Sandler), Deborah (Téa Leoni), and their children Bernice and Georgie. (This may remind you of the subplot in ""Love, Actually"" between the Englishman---played by Colin Firth---who speaks no Portuguese, who falls in love with his beautiful servant---played by Lúcia Moniz---who speaks no English.) Another stretch of credulity: We're expected to believe that Adam Sandler is the best chef in America when his on-screen persona in this film is more suited to being the dishwasher than the chef. His wife Deborah (well played by Leoni in a rather cruelly written role) is basically good but also neurotic, insecure, thoughtless, and so self-centered that she is largely unaware of her almost total lack of respect for others' boundaries. Flor is baffled by the dynamics of this Anglo family, all the more so when a rather contrived crisis ensues: Deborah loses her job, sending her into a spiral of agonized anxiety; and John's restaurant may get a four-star rating, which spooks John, who is convinced that too much success will spoil his restaurant. The family decides to spend the summer at a beach house. Against her better judgment, Flor agrees to spend the summer with them, and perforce so must Cristina. Flor feels threatened as she watches the Claskys begin to treat the sweet, pretty Cristina almost as their own daughter. As Flor learns English and John and Deborah drift apart, absorbed in their separate crises, there is an unexpected development that increases Flor's unease: Cristina turns out to be a brilliant student, prompting Deborah, who has only good intentions, to sponsor Cristina for a scholarship at Bernice's private school, which Cristina gets. Flor does not want to lose Cristina to the Anglo world, but at the same time, she and John are growing closer. In the last act, Deborah confesses to John that she has been having an affair for 3 months, whereupon John, stunned by the revelation, turns to Flor, who confesses her love for John. They act on their mutual attraction but sensibly don't give in entirely to it. And Flor decides the only course of action that will restore order and sanity in her life and her relationship with her daughter is to quit her job with the Claskys and take Cristina out of the private school. The marital crisis between John and Deborah is not resolved but the suggestion is that it will be.This film takes a refreshingly non-stereotypical approach to the relationship between the Latin and Anglo cultures in this country. However, as other reviewers have noted, its richness is its own worst enemy, because it does try to take on more than it can comfortably hold. Numerous sequences in the film seem to lack shape or focus, or trail off uncertainly. A number of plot points lack sufficient exposition in a way that suggests linking scenes were edited out of the final cut. The performances are superb, except for Adam Sandler's, and even his wasn't bad, it just didn't really fit. I have felt pretty cynical about the fact that American filmmakers have some mania about bringing British and Australian actors and actresses over here to play American roles when there are so many underemployed American actors out there, so now I can be even more cynical to see the same thing happening in the Hispanic world: The Spaniard Paz Vega coming over to play a Mexican woman. She must have had a good dialect coach because she speaks convincing Mexican Spanish instead of Castilian; or maybe she just spent a lot of time on Whittier Boulevard. It also begs credulity to believe that she could learn such good English so quickly or that she could understand the Claskys, because I could barely understand them: Adam Sandler mostly mumbles and Téa Leoni chatters a mile a minute, and both of them speak not in declarative sentences but in elliptical, idiom-ridden monologues that in real life Flor would probably have found utterly unintelligible. The real gems in this movie are Cloris Leachman, who with a relatively small supporting role as Deborah's mother nevertheless manages almost to steal the movie, and Shelbie Bruce, who has the makings of a real star.",Spanglish
99,janos451,'Spanglish' vs. '2046' - Expectations vs. Reality,8,16 December 2004,"It pays to attend screenings, rather than relying on your expectations. I've been waiting for months for an advance copy of Kar Wai Wong's ""2046"" (which won't be released in the US for several months), and totally ignored news of James L. Brooks' ""Spanglish."" Let's compare: ""2046"" has Ziyi Zhang, Li Gong, Carina Lau, Maggie Cheung - be still my heart! ""Spanglish"" comes with Adam Sandler. Let's compare, indeed. And, of course, you saw this coming, right? - ""Spanglish"" rocks and ""2046"" is fairly awful.""Spanglish"" recalls old Hollywood, it redeems the genre. Careful now: it's not a great or even big movie, but it's a gem. I am pretty sure about it because I saw it twice already.Zhang Yimou's ""Hero"" was the only movie in years that I went back to see again after the initial preview screening, and before it opened commercially. Now I did the same with ""Spanglish."" Let's be clear: ""Spanglish"" is not ""Hero,"" it's not a grand, operatic, sweeping epic - a *great* film. No, ""Spanglish"" is a small, good movie, but compelling enough to see again, and I am glad I did. Brooks' writing and direction revive a long-gone tradition, movie-making in which Hollywood and intelligence coexist, something harking back to those 1940s comedies and romances you cannot stop watching when they come up on the late-late show.Hollywood it is: a Cinderella story of a young Mexican woman working for an LA family, being - of course - better in every way than the rich gringos.The Spanish film star Paz Vega is gorgeous and her film-star figure and long eyelashes don't make her a very believable ""Mexican maid."" But Brooks - of ""As Good as it Gets"" and ""Terms of Endearment"" - takes a Hollywood lie and makes it work. With old-fashioned, linear, intelligent story-telling, he makes the story believable. (Bertolucci did just as well with Thandie Newton in the memorable ""Besieged."") And Brooks also does something brave and commendable: he assumes that the audience doesn't consist of morons. There are unfinished sentences, expressions speaking volumes, a key character shows up for one minutes, disappears and yet when the wife strays, we know - without being hit over the head with it - that the other man is the real estate agent with the right window settings to make the passenger's hair in the convertible fly in the right direction.Sandler - who already earned credentials as an Actor in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" - plays a character based on Napa's Thomas Keller, of The French Laundry and New York's Per Se, a brilliant chef, a good father, a decent chap... with trouble at home (although that part may have nothing to do with Keller). As Vega, Sandler is believable, even more so. With understated, committed acting, he creates a likable, ""real"" character.Tea Leoni's insincere, inauthentic, well-meaning/trouble-making wife is way too much, but the writing is so simple, funny and good (""I am not mad at you,"" she assures whomever she hurts, and she means it) that you go along for the ride, and just enjoy it, even as you take in whatever foolishness Cary Grant and Kate Hepburn decided to serve up. (Leoni is good, but she is no Hepburn; Cate Blanchette is, playing the role in ""The Aviator,"" but that's another story.) The beauty of ""Spanglish"" is that you care for and about all the characters, especially Cloris Leachman's dissolute and endearing grandmother, and the kids - Shelbie Bruce as the bilingual Cristina, playing the maid's college-bound daughter, and the brilliant Sarah Steele whose crisis with clothes size you will never forget.""Decency can be sexy,"" Brooks has said, and he proves it in ""Spanglish."" The attraction of the characters to each other (and to the audience) is based on their understanding of and support for each other, they are smitten and carried away by each other's goodness. Brooks also comes up with an ending you don't expect, but one which leaves you moved and, in some way, happy.I need to stop because overpraising ""Spanglish"" is a disservice; it's ""just"" a very good, small flick I both enjoyed and relished after the fact - a rare bonus.So, on to the bad news. ""2046"" is the year of the film's location (also the last year Beijing committed to the preservation of Hong Kong's separate system), a room number, something or other. Tony Leung's character goes back and forth between various periods, and romances the leading ladies - but neither he nor the audience gets much joy out of it. The story is both deliberately confusing and confused in writing and direction. A major disappointment... except for the soundtrack, which combines Dean Martin and Callas, the latter with repeated performances of ""Casta diva"" from ""Norma.""",Spanglish

THIS MOVIE REALLY IS AN Oscar MATERIAL. I really think this movie truly deserves an Oscar (for it's simplicity, sub themes).All the cast members really worked in this MASTERPIECE. It's truly a GEM. I really respect Adam Sandler for showing his versatile acting side also the leading lady Paz Vega. Even the child artist were perfect in each role. This movie is drama/ comedy...or a little Black comedy. But the bottom-line is ""This movie really made my day"".This movie deals with self identity, family values which is extremely hard to see in today's world.Too bad it didn't get nominated for the Academy Awards that year (but the irony is bad mediocre pathetic movies like SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, went for Oscars).This is Hollywood's best. Too bad if you miss this WELL SPIRITED ONE.

It may be making a bunch of social statements but I do not find them entertaining. Worst of all every improbable piece of every slowly developing story line just never plays out to any reasonable conclusion. I found my self so dis-satisfied that after the movie stops (it has no ending per se, it just stops), I walk out trying to write my own fairale stopend to Spanglish, a comdram I could have done without!

103,majic-5,Old values in a new country,6,11 November 2007,"In an engaging way, Spanglish tackles a dilemma: how can a Latino parent integrate into a new country, but ensure that her daughter cherishes traditional Latino attitudes and traditions? The movie's characters, unfortunately, are more archetypes than believable people. Deborah Clasky is the perfect suburban bitch, and a terrible mom to Bernice, who is average in many ways. Deborah's husband, John, is unbelievably decent, and a successful L.A. chef. Then we have Flor, the Clasky's nanny-maid. She is a madonna of working-class virtue: beautiful but chaste, hard-working, nurturing, and protective of her right to raise her daughter, Cristina, by traditional Latino standards. Cristina is the daughter Deborah always wanted to have: brainy, attractive, well-mannered, and thin. Deborah seduces Cristina with shopping trips, overnights, and finally, a scholarship to a private school. Flor is justifiably insulted by Deborah's arrogance and worried about losing Cristina. Despite the stock character types, the issues of employee exploitation, cultural assimilation, and the language barrier create plenty of dramatic tension. Things get more complicated by a budding romance between John and Flor, who fall for each other's decency and kindness. Things come to a boiling point, of course. It's here that Flor makes a gutsy, mature decision, deciding not to create a marital mess. I truly admired Flor for that, even though a real human being would probably take a chance on love. All Flor can do at this point is quit and take Cristina with her. Cristina howls as they walk down the street, crying and raging about how Flor is stealing the opportunities she deserves. It's here that Flor makes another mature move, giving Cristina a choice about their future. The audience gasped, then held its breath, waiting for Cristina's answer. See Spanglish and see if you have the same reaction.",Spanglish
104,kittiwake-1,serious role for Sandler,9,8 November 2006,"Adam Sandler in a serious role? Worked for me! This movie is essentially about a young Mexican-only-speaking woman who ends up working for a very liberal, English-only-speaking American family. I think everyone could identify with at least one of the characters of this great flick. I found myself laughing, crying, and thinking. This movie asks a lot of questions, and you have to look inside yourself for the answers. How difficult is it to really be yourself? Can you continue to ""be yourself"" when it isn't what everyone else wants you to do? How do you deal with someone who insists you conform to their idea of what you should be? And, how neurotic can one housewife be? (just kidding) Caught you getting serious. Remember, after all, that this is just a movie. While it represents people we know, or even ourselves, it can entertain us as well. Parts were so funny, I was laughing tears. Parts were so touching, the tears weren't about laughter. I highly recommend this, especially to anyone who ever felt ""not quite good enough"" or wondered why other people can't be what we want them to be. (I think that's pretty much everyone, isn't it?) I feel that the relationship between the women and the daughters made this movie very real to me. I can't wait to watch it with my daughter when she's a teen. I think it would open a lot of doors for conversation. It's not a 100% chick flick, guys. Try it. Everyone I know who saw this movie loved it and recommended it to their friends.

I remember very little from this movie (that's how much it impressed me), and I think the wretchedness of the film forced my brain to eliminate or suppress such a bad memory.When I was in high school, I really liked films like ""Happy Gilmore."" Thankfully, I've been able to avoid nearly all of his subsequent garbage, including his latest abominations Jack and Jill (ha!!!) and That's My Boy. What a loser this Mr. Sandler is.

106,bgood26,Sandler plays it straight in a movie about relationships,7,29 December 2004,"""Spanglish"" is about a family coming apart at the seams, as told through the housekeeper's point of view. It is a story of the relationship between two very different families: a wealthy Anglo-LA family, and a poor Mexican mother and daughter.Adam Sandler finally plays a grown up, intelligent family man in ""Spanglish,"" and is very good in the role. He plays Jon Clasky, a master chef and restaurateur with an insecure wife, two preteen children, an alcoholic mother-in-law, and a beautiful Mexican housekeeper. Jon, who has ""the emotions of a Mexican woman,"" fears success. Flor Moreno (Paz Vega) is a single mom from Mexico who crosses the border ""economy class"" (illegally). She settles in East LA, a predominantly Mexican area, and works two jobs to support her daughter Cristina. When Cristina enters middle school, Flor (roll the 'r') realizes that she needs to keep a closer eye on her. So she gets a job as a housekeeper with the Claskys. After some time, she forces herself to learn English so she could communicate with the Claskys, and eventually develops a close friendship with Jon.Téa Leoni is the controlling, manipulative wife Deborah. She hints that her daughter Bernice is overweight by buying her clothes that are a size too small. She borrows Cristina to take her shopping, enrolls her in an elite private school, both without asking Flor.Cloris Leachman is funny and touching as Deborah's boozing mother, who just wants to be a mom. Sarah Steele is wonderful as Bernice, the wise yet vulnerable preteen daughter. And the Shelbie Bruce is very good as the smart bilingual Cristina, who befriends Bernice and adopts the Claskys as her parents.And now the negative. The character of Georgie, Jon and Deborah's son, is underdeveloped, so much so that he might as well have not been in the movie. And there were some parts of the film that moved very slowly, and some scenes which were dragged out. But James L. Brooks (co-creator of ""the Simpsons"") brought out the best in his actors, especially Sandler and Vega.",Spanglish
107,gregorybnyc,God Bless James L. Brooks,10,9 June 2005,"James L. Brooks has been giving us such splendid entertainment as a writer, as a producer, as a director for so many years now. I stayed away from SPANGLISH over the Christmas holidays because the reviews were less than mixed, and in a busy season, I made the mistake of thinking it probably wasn't very good. I'm no Adam Sandler fan either. Well I saw SPANGLISH last night and went on this site to read other comments about the film. Lots of you seemed to like the film, and so many of you had questions or thought the film was somehow incomplete:Why would Flor, the housekeeper for the Clasky's give up here daughter's private school scholarship?There's no way a gorgeous woman like Flor would be unmarried and working as a housekeeper in Beverly Hills.Tea Leoni's character is bipolar.The film tries to tackle too many story lines at once.The proof of SPANGLISH's excellence is that everybody sees something different, and I think that's where its greatness is. I also think we'll be watching it for years to come with an ever-developing affection and cult-like devotion. I'm assuming you've read the plot line, so I'll just stick to the aspects of this movie which made it such a great experience for me. Brooks' real talent is in giving us stories about people we care about, even after we've decided we don't like them. Shirley MacLaine's great performance in TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, and Jack Nicholson's in AS GOOD AS IT GETS are not nice people, nor are the three leads in BROADCAST NEWS very likable, but they grow on you. In SPANGLISH we enter the lives of a upwardly mobile Los Angeles couple, both driven by their work which makes them nuts, but too busy to get off the treadmill and smell the flowers. Tea Leoni 's Deborah is a character who is very neurotic, controlling, arrogant, competitive, spoiled, bratty, cold, and all-too-human. Now a full-time house- mommy after being downsized by her company, she's feeling unfulfilled and dazed by being somehow reduced to motherhood. Leoni gives an incredibly brave performance, and you still don't like her in the end. Adam Sandler, putting aside his obnoxious screen schtick for a second, is totally believable as John, the sweetly hen-pecked and cuckolded husband, who is falling for Flor. Scared of his success as a first-rate chef, he's nearly paralyzed when his sous-chef announces he has the backing to leave and open his own place. But as usual, both husband and wife throw money at any situation that seems to threaten them. Cloris Leachman is back to remind us just what a superb character actress she is, and her wise and loving alcoholic grandmother who is indulged and ignored and condescended to by her daughter, ends up with some of the wisest advice she can give her daughter when the crisis of her marriage has to be faced in real terms and without her usual hysterics. Grandma has lots to atone for over her own neglect, and Leachman's character seems brave enough to put down the booze and face the music. Paz Vega is a gorgeous woman and is radiant as Flor, the housekeeper. She's a wonderfully protective mother, and she gets totally caught up in her employer's dysfunctional family. The device of having her speaking only Spanish in the first half of the movie, and shyly testing her English in the second half really works as she is an expressive actress. I had no trouble reading her thoughts. All the kids are pitch-perfect, especially the young actress who plays the Clasky's daughter, Bernice. Crushed by her mother's never-subtle hints about her weight, there's a heartbreaking scene where her mother gives her shopping bags of new clothing, all of it too small to fit her. Brooks doesn't offer any tidy answers here. His characters don't emerge ""better""--they just are. Flor quits and takes her beloved daughter with her, away from Deborah, who acts like the only reason she helps to arrange a scholarship for her at her daughter's private school and showers her with gifts, is because Flor's child is really the kid she would prefer to have. And away from John because she knows there's no future for her. She's not a home-wrecker, and she wants to preserve her daughter's own identify, not become middle-class and Anglo. Many people would argue she's nuts to deny her daughter, including me. But I see Brooks' point. You know Deborah and John will probably not stay together. She's wound way too tight, and when her daughter goes through puberty, war will be declared in that household. As much as I liked Sandler's warm and neurotically hen-pecked patriarch, he's way too passive-aggressive in his own house, colluding with his daughter to make up for her mother's insensitivity. Grandma may have put herself on the wagon to save her daughter's marriage, but there are issues between them from their past that need lots of healing. And what of the virtually ignored little brother? A little messy, and hugely ambitious, SPANGLISH is a lot like life. Brooks is a great auteur, and here he offers no easy answers of solutions. He keeps giving us films with characters with depth that we recognize and care about. His is a great talent in an industry where humor and intelligence are in very short supply. I watched this film with a friend of mine who started to cry halfway through the picture and didn't stop. SPANGLISH is going into my permanent DVD collection.",Spanglish

Hired by the John and Deborah Clasky (Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni) as their housekeeper, Flor contends with the language barrier, Cristina's budding femininity, and the eccentric Clasky's way of life.Writer/director James L. Brooks can hardly be accused of saturating the marketplace (five films in just over four times as many years), which makes 'Spanglish' something of an event film. While 'Spanglish' is not the heartwarmer that 'As Good as It Gets' is, it's nevertheless quite enjoyable, with an effervescent performance from Spanish actress Paz Vega (in her first English speaking role). Adam Sandler, despite receiving first billing here, is not the main character of the picture, and Vega steals every scene from him, but it's a solid performance nonetheless.

It certainly wasn't. Technically the movie is classified as a comedy, but it seemed more like a drama to me. It certainly had its humorous moments, but not because Adam Sandler was hopping around like an idiot doing his normal cinematic song and dance.The Clasky family lives comfortable in Los Angelos. The father/husband, John (Sandler), is a chef at an upscale restaurant. His wife, Deb (Leoni), is an overachiever who doesn't know very much about how to deal with her family. For lack of a better word, the woman is psychotic. They have two children, Bernice and George, and they're looking for somebody to be their housekeeper/nanny. They find a young Mexican woman by the name of Flur (Vega) who speaks next to no English, and understands close to the same amount. Oddly enough, the Clasky's like her immediately and welcome her into the family.The movie takes a very humanistic approach, focusing on the lives of everybody in the family, how they affect each other, and how their Mexican housekeeper reacts to them. The interactions between everyone are very interesting.Relatively early in the movie, John's restaurant gets critiqued, and he comes out on the other side with a four star rating. Oddly enough, he is very unhappy with this outcome. He was hoping to get a three and a quarter rating or something like that. Good enough for the public to know the restaurant was a good place to eat, but not so highly ranked that every snooty individual wants to eat their and the restaurant is booked months in advance, changing the whole atmosphere and dynamic of the restaurant. John wants it to stay as a simple place that he can control.I'm not really sure what else to write about. You really have to just watch the movie to understand what it's about. There's a great deal that goes on between the Clasky's and Flur and her daughter, and it's very interesting how things turn out.It's somewhat refreshing to see Adam Sandler expanding his horizons and doing something that we aren't really used to.

112,arichmondfwc,El Norte of James L Brooks,7,26 April 2005,"Gregory Nava's ""El Norte"" was a memorable journey into the Latino experience in white wealthy country. That masterpiece had a heartbreaking scene between the Latino maid and a washing machine. ""Spanglish"" merely hints to a similar moment between the Latino maid and a coffee machine. The ""merely hinting"" is at the heart of this painful comedy of manners. This is the journey of an observer not of someone who actually lived it. As a consequence he treats his own with an iron hand and the others with a romantic, heroic, fairy taleish sort of slant. Putting aside the potential seriousness of the story, the film is a moving, entertainment fantasy in the land of opulence and guilt. The borders here are not geographic but personal, the aliens are the natives. They become illegal in their own existence and step all over their own lives without noticing, trying to care, trying to be the best they can possibly be but without points of reference or enough substance for their acts to have any kind of real meaning. Tea Leoni gives a performance of such fearlessness that sometimes you feel she may jump out of the screen. Cloris Leachman is great as an alcoholic wise woman who doesn't want to be judged. Paz Vega represents the ideal Latin heroine in a wealthy American's story. She is beautiful and powerful and utterly unlikely. Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler and seems to stand passively between the blonder than blond world of his wife and the exotic gorgeousness world of his maid. I would like to know what happened to Paz and her daughter after leaving behind the chances to be or become like everyone else in the white wealthy country of make believe, or is that too much to ask.",Spanglish

She tries to be the ""strong"" type that the media pushes so hard, but in the process she's lost her humanity and capability to love. She's also a basket case.Adam Sandler plays a good man who seems to have had the masculinity whipped out of him by a male-hostile media culture. He's too scared to disagree with his wife and refuses to make a stand on any decision. As a result, the very thing that makes a man attractive to a woman is no longer there. He's become a woman, as his Mexican maid observes.This film is a sharp look at modern couples and the effects of the North American culture where a feminist agenda has gone haywire. It's a bit of a chick flick to be sure, especially all the stuff with the Mexican girl and her mom, but still interesting. Maybe this should serve as a wakeup call to men in North America: don't stop being a man. Just because you are masculine and sometimes stand up even to your wife, it doesn't make you a jerk.

So sweet the macho guy behind me in the theatre was - well not crying, but he had a runny nose that didn't show up until the last reel. A lot of eye-wiping as we walked out.The best thing about the love story was that I didn't realize who the principals were until the very end.Tea Leoni's performance may seem one sided if you've never met a person like her character. People like that ARE one sided because they're too busy clinging to what they imagine is their last thread of sanity to develop anything like a real personality.Cloris Leachman was very good. Adam Sandler - and I thought I'd never say this - gave a measured performance as a man who never reveals his demons in public.",Spanglish

This past year wasn't his year. But never the less Spanglish is a very good movie with great performances from every single person in the film, especially from Tea Leoni. Sometimes the film is harsh but it has to be. I originally thought the ending made Paz Vega look mean and harsh but the second time i saw it i realized she had to. i knew she had to first time i saw it just thought she was being a little to mean and harsh. Adam Sandler did a really good job in this film and i was pleasantly shocked. and as usual Cloris Leachman was fantastic. Paz Vega's first American film role was very good as well. The kids in the film were also very good. All in all a good movie with a tuff ending.",Spanglish
118,zaisjr,How on Earth can anyone like this film?,2,2 February 2010,"Maybe it's because many of my friends are or are family members of immigrants. Maybe it's because I speak English and Spanish. Maybe it's because I've been to many Latin American countries. No matter what the reason, this movie is horrible. Completely unrealistic and awful. Let's start off with the few good things about the movie. Adam Sandler was a great choice for this role and did an awesome job. Paz Vega is hot. That's it. Yep, that's it. Here are the problems with the movie. 1. Paz plays a Mexican immigrant named ""Flor"". She's Spanish for crying out loud! Why didn't a Mexican or someone close to being Mexican get the part? Oh yeah, they probably saw how pathetic the role was. 2. Paz Vega's character is a single mother from Mexico trying to raise her daughter in America. The movie portrays this as an easy task to do. ""Flor"" learned the English language quickly from cassette tapes. In a couple months she was practically fluent. Right. While living poor and alone (aside from her daughter) in an awful Mexican suburb (that's right, I said suburb... which looks like the cleanest part of Mexico... and far from struggling) Flor finds out that her baby's father is abandoning them. She easily moves to the US. No real hardships, just walks in and gets the job as a maid for a famous chef. 3. Adam Sandler plays a famous chef who never really works. The movie does address this a little bit by showing the sous chef's frustrations with having to bear the brunt of the work and demanding more pay. But Sandler's character hardly ever works. It's rare that famous chefs have so much free time. Major chefs are rarely home nor do they usually have crap loads of free time. 4. There was only one believable character, the grandmother. That was it. Even Adam Sandler's great performance couldn't overcome how awful his character was written. 5. The movie shows how ""Flor"" and John (Sandler) are possibly meant for each other. Her man left her alone with her child and John's wife cheats on him repeatedly (doesn't even hide it) and never really shows that she cares for her children. John and Flor show close connections and love for their children. When Flor and John become close, Deborah (John's wife) suddenly realizes her mistake, cries repeatedly over how awful she has been, and then begs for her husband to come back. In the end, Flor leaves the home, and then you are left with the assumption that the couple will settle their issues and stay together. On what planet does this happen? If you are so daring as to basically allow everyone to know that you are cheating on your husband, you aren't going to change your mind one day and then fall in love again with your husband and children. It's not going to happen. It was an awful and pointless ending. Flor and her daughter's story was hardly touched upon. The movie had a great premise, but it was put together quite poorly. I have a VHS copy of this movie laying around. If anyone wants it, take it. I'm just glad that it's a VHS so it's likely to fall apart soon and not be playable again.",Spanglish
119,returning,Sitcom-ish,4,14 January 2005,"The phrase ""better than expected"" jumps to mind when trying to review this film. But when the expectations were set as low as mine were for this film, that's not saying much. Still, enough will be said about how the film is unconvincingly far-fetched and manipulatively stereotypical. So let's look at the good.The theme of success is dealt with most explicitly in Sandler's character, but it seemed as if every character was also pursuing his/her own definition of success. The mother's success was defined by her daughter's weight-loss, projecting her own insecurities onto her. The grandmother wished to prevent people from making the same mistakes that she did. And Flor just wanted to provide for her daughter. So, with all these different definitions, it's interesting to see how they all react to it. Sandler rejects success as meaningless and ultimately destructive to what he really wants, the mother discovers that her pursuit of success is destroying her relationships with those around her, the grandmother finds comfort and atonement, and Flor just sticks it out, doing the best she can and staying true to her original goal.This is all to say that Brooks is an excellent organiser of characters and their various positions. But saying that everyone reacts differently to success isn't exactly groundbreaking, and should be the subject of a sitcom rather than a film you pay $12 to see. Everything else in this film was just filler for me.2 out of 5 - Bad outweighs the good",Spanglish

Shelby was especially awesome. The scenes of her translating for her mom were pure magic!. Adam Sandler was his usual nice guy self. Mumbling incoherent dialogs, shuffling through the role.

121,livewire9000,Film wasted on cultural propaganda,1,23 March 2008,"This film was ultimately disappointing. There was an obvious intention from the moment that the film began to make a certain southern culture seem ultimately wonderful, perfect, courageous, virtuous, intelligent and generally superior to the US. Counterwise, it portrayed Americans as strange, dizzy, fractured, inconsiderate, rude and alcoholic. At times, the direction of the film seemed so desperate to portray the ""glorious"" nature of the foreign culture that it created weird, astringed and completely unbelievable characters. Also, Vega's acting was way over the top. At times her actions seemed even spastic and always severely dramatic. There was no humor evident in this movie. Though I enjoyed seeing Sandler in a more dramatic role, his acting was only fair, and his humor was reduced to less than a shadow. As can be expected with this type of propaganda film, the plot seemed overly obvious from the very beginning. The supposed romance between Sandler and Vega seemed forced and completely scripted. I would skip this film. Very disappointing--completely unrealistic. A cultural farce.",Spanglish

The message of cultural identity loss and integration, as well as immigration, is as much if not more relevant today than when it was made. Spanglish was not a box office hit, far from it.

123,ChRiS-803,A Wannabee Oscar Contender,4,15 March 2005,"'Spanglish' has all the right ingredients but somehow its execution is over-baked despite being in the capable hands of a seasoned director who knows this genre well. It seems everyone here is on autopilot cruising through this movie as if it was automatically going to work without their enthusiastic input. This is a classic example of a Hollywood project being too confident for its own good. Everyone here probably assumed this was a sure-fire Oscar contender so why work any harder? Ironically, 'Spanglish' failed to receive a single Oscar nomination and is far from the masterpiece that should be expected from James L. Brooks. It's not a bad film, just a misguided one with unpleasant characters and a lack of sparkle that should come from a film of this kind.John and Deborah Clasky (Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni) are a dysfunctional family living a nice, comfortable life in LA. They have two kids Bernie and Georgie (Sarah Steele and Ian Hyland), the lovable pet dog and even Grandma (Cloris Leachman) lives with them. Beneath the surface of their perfect existence, the family is mixed up. In come a new maid Flor (Paz Vega) and her daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) who shakes things up with their adopted family. Will John and Deborah rekindle their dying relationship? Will John fall for Flor? Will Flor lose her daughter's respect to Deborah? Will Deborah realise her own daughter's potential? This melodrama is similar to any family, so why do we care about the Clasky family when most of these characters are very unpleasant? None of these characters are portrayed as real and are ambiguous in their motives and behaviour.James L. Brooks has made films like 'Terms of Endearment' and 'As Good As It Gets' so he obviously knows this genre well. The problem here is that none of it seems believable and everyone seems superficial. There's no realness and no satisfaction in the development of the story with an ending that is unconvincing. Brooks' also doesn't do his actors any justice by making some of them seem horrible people (Deborah is an awful person) or just plain boring (John). Then there's the focal point of the story - Flor who's motivations seems weird. Did she just want to be a maid? Did she want to be a part of this family? Does she have feelings and emotions? Why is she always upset for no reason? This isn't a peak of James L. Brooks' career.The poor actors are stuck with superficial, unpleasant and at times boring characters. But they all try very, very hard. Adam Sandler probably doesn't have a remote chance to ever score himself an Oscar nomination, but he is underrated as an actor. Sure, he's a comedian but even though he looks bored with this role, it seems to be a part of his attempt to not overdo his acting. Poor Tea Leoni is given a relentlessly nasty character who does everything wrong in this film but doesn't learn anything. Leoni does a good job trying to make it work, but it's a role that no actress could have pulled off - the writing was too damaging. Then there's Paz Vega as Flor who doesn't radiate and is a mix between Sandler's boring character and Leoni's nasty character. The kids - Shelbie Bruce and Sarah Steele are also annoying as the two girls while Ian Hyland fares slightly better in an underwritten role. On the plus side, Cloris Leachman is superb as Evelyn and steals every scene she is in and even though they have badly written roles, Sandler and Leoni make a nice couple.'Spanglish' isn't a bad movie, but it's lifeless and overly superficial without a single ounce of honesty. Why would you want to be invested in these characters who aren't very nice to be around (Grandma Evelyn excluded)? The screenplay is full of overly predictable clichés such as the adulterous affair, the love triangle, the daughter who wants her parents' attention etcit's been done before, so if it needs to be redone, there should be a fresh spin and Brooks' doesn't have much to give us other than a truly horrible family. And why stretch this melodrama out for over 2 ½ hours is anyone's guess and the film reaches its use-by-date after its first hour and languishes with inconsequential subplots for way too long. From the outset, everything about this film looked right but looks can be deceiving.",Spanglish
124,jerrywilson,Simply the finest movie I have ever seen,10,15 July 2006,"People sometimes ask me what my favorite movie is. I have always had a tough time with that question, because, just like with my favorite music, the answer depends on what mood I'm in at the time. My favorite comedy is probably ""Down Periscope."" My favorite date movie is probably ""You've Got Mail."" My favorite action adventure is probably ""The Italian Job,"" or maybe ""The Score."" But my favorite movie of all time, I really couldn't answer. Now I can.I've seen ""Spanglish"" a number of times, including once in the theater. I own the DVD. But every time I watch it, I grow to like it better. Now, after seeing it tonight, for about the fifth time, I can honestly state that it is my all-time favorite movie of any genre.It is the perfect movie, I've discovered. Every actor, especially Adam Sandler, plays their parts to perfection. I can identify with each and every one. I've never been a big fan of Cloris Leachman, but I loved her in this film. Her character was precious.Paz Vega is beautiful and talented. Although her character is far too overprotective of her daughter, their association is clarified by the end. It is one of the most poignant moments I've ever seen in any movie.I don't like a great deal of character development in most movies I watch, especially the action movies. But the interpersonal relationships that are developed in this movie are developed to perfection. The writing, dialogue, and direction are superb. Why this movie isn't rated among the top 100 in beyond me. It's funny where it needs to be and touching where it has to be but without being overtly maudlin, although I've cried every time I've watched it. (Yeah, I know. I'm a middle-aged man who seldom cries over anything, but this movie gets me.) Suffice it to say, if there was any movie that ever came close to perfection, this one is it. Enough said.",Spanglish
125,joekay,Two hour movie that's one hour too long,4,22 December 2004,"Spanglish starts off in a charming James L. Brooks type of way, with funny moments both conspicuous and subtle. But about half way through the flick, the focus starts being lost and suffers from the syndrome of too many characters having too many problems, even compared to earlier Brooks movies such as As Good As It Gets (which I loved). Certain characters, like that of Leoni and her mother, are much too polarized to even resemble sane people, a critical weak point that does not ever allow the audience to sympathize with them, especially the ""monster"" mom. This isn't just a subpar Brooks work, it's a subpar movie in general.",Spanglish

I must say I really couldn't stand Sarah Steel's (Bernice) acting. She felt way too posh and really seamed to be overacting. I hate to say that since she's from around my area and I should be rooting for the home team. I love Adam Sandler but was starting to get tired of his humor. I was happy to see not a sign of Billy Madison here, he was great. I've always been a Tea Leoni fan but is it me or did she look about 10 years older than she is in this? The last couple lines of the film (said by Cristina narrating) confused me. I would highly recommend this film to anyone though.",Spanglish
127,ScooterKSU,Being That Sane Can Drive You Nuts,7,15 August 2005,"I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan so much I could quote every line from Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy for much of the late 90's. Going into the new millennium, Sandler seem to not be able to decide whether to stick with his sophomoric shtick as with Little Nicky or move into a more sophisticated style as he did in Punch Drunk Love. And of course there is always romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore. His latest trek into the sophisticated realm was Spanglish.The backdrop of the film is an essay a student has written for her application to Yale. It explains why her mother is the person she most admires and goes on to explain how her mom took her from Mexico and made her the person she was today. The problem with this is that the movie then doesn't revolve around the young girl yet focuses on the family he mother began to work for upon arriving in America. In fact the girl gets very little screen time in the movie. The family includes Sandler as the dad with an inferiority complex at being the best chef in the country, his wife, played by Téa Leoni, a victim of downsizing who can quite adapt to being a stay at home mom. They have two children, a son who barely makes blip on screen and an overweight daughter played by an actress who tries to pull off the ""wise beyond her age"" act but isn't able to do so. Alcoholic grandma also lives with them played perfectly by Cloris Leachman who delivers the best line in the movie, ""Honey, lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense."" That line has entered into my repertoire of insults and can't wait until I find the perfect time to unleash it.The movie finally hit its stride when the family movies to a beach house for the summer when Sandler's family is introduced to the Mexican girl who is forced to move in with them due to distance reasons. Leoni finds in her the daughter she always wanted which causes problem with basically everyone else in the film.The film is well written finding a balance in-between drama and comedy and also features what was one of the most disturbing sex scenes I have seen in a while. If that ever happen to me, I may have to give up sex for a while. As for the negatives, the movie seems to forget that is it based on an essay and there are many things that I doubt the girl ever knew yet she is able to write about it. Also all the driving scenes it is very obvious that green screens were used and they looked as bad as a SNL skit. A big budget movie should avoid such pitfalls. On the DVD, don't forget to check out the deleted scenes to see one of the funniest scenes with Leoni's character preparing for a party. Although the other scenes make you understand why they left out.",Spanglish
128,LeslieLLKing,"Spanglish - Flor is cut short of Flourishing, and English spans the globe.",7,23 December 2004,"Spanglish is beach-side Malibu family saga movie with potential to draw us closer, but James Brooks' script spreads itself too thin, so that key parts are left either unexplored, or only touched upon, all too briefly. The audience doesn't really feel on board this family saga roller coaster ride, and if we don't feel it, then we really aren't experiencing it, the way we ought to. My list of parts that need more attention:  Deborah's (Tea Leoni) son Georgie (Ian Hyland), the looking neglected child  Deborah's affair with the Realtor, only a glimpse of him in his convertible  Deborah's complex about not feeling useful or successful in a professional job  Flor's (Paz Vega) hang-up on exposing, her daughter Cristina (Victoria Luna and Shelbie Bruce), to normal American kid-life  John's drinking tendency and never being at work  Why does Deborah dote on Cristina, and never includes her own daughter, Bernice, ""Bernie,"" (Sarah Steele) in the girls' day out on the town?  Flor's magical transition from speaking no English to speaking it fluently with John, (Adam Sandler) in an intimate night, at his restaurant. Maybe she took a Berlitz course, when no one was noticing?Deborah's affair was a key turning point in the film. John is so upset at Deborah, that he cannot be in the same room with her and has to leave the house, driving himself into hypocrisy, where he wines, dines and cuddles Flor the house help. Obviously, he is just as weak as Deborah, at holding onto marital fidelity. Glumly sinking into his own feelings of despair, in response to Deborah's affair, was just the opportunity of exit he was looking for, to spend some hurt puppy dog time with Flor. Obviously, you can see it bothered me that when Deborah cried the truth of her affair, John, in turn, wasn't willing to admit, his warm and comforting crush on Flor? I guess, it was just more time for Deborah to beat herself up over the situation.Poor Deborah is flying in and out of the house, and the audience is only speculating she is having an affair. We don't really know it until she confides in John. Why is Deborah portrayed as the loose floozy on the go, while John gets to wade in the warm pools of innuendo with the lovely, but culturally confused, Flor? Maybe Deborah should have had an affair with the pool boy, much less work for her, and John could be flying long distance, maintaining a buff chest and shedding the puppy dog style for that of a tiger. Yeah, I like that idea better. Category: More trivial talk  Why was Deborah always concerned about other people's appearances, like strangers she did not even know? I guess the answer would be some where far out there in the response of ""whatever.""  After having not one but two children, and beyond her young adult years wouldn't she be getting a grip on feeling comfortable with her weight and being more as one with her body?  When Deborah was on top of John, I wasn't sure if she was really having sex with him (thinking of when Harry met Sally); but then it looked like she was; I laughed a lot at her orgasm; Yeah Tea! It was much more colorful, exuberant and exciting to watch than Bill Macy's in ""The Cooler."" The orgasm scene in and of itself was enough to make every woman walk away from the theatre feeling profoundly liberated. Yeah! We like orgasm gone wild, Sally style, in its plump and overweight motif, even if the husband, is a body pancake, on the bed. Hence, reason for Realtor on the side. Orgasm achieved in film  check.The film concludes with no dramatic surprises. Everyone ends up where we expect, for better or for worse. Adam Sandler does a wonderful job at playing a marsh-mellow Dad, husband, and a man of weak indulgences  booze and housekeeper lusting. Cloris Leachman, as Evelyn, the Grandmother does a fine job of drinking wine and comforting family members. That sounded funny, I know, but its true. It would have been nice to see her doing something a little more playful with the Grandchildren or a man she has a thing for, but I suppose that was her prerogative, not to ask James, to add a play scene in for her. Each and every performance is well portrayed for the quirky, unraveling feel type of script. Sometimes it looks good and feels good to come loose at the seams and this film accomplishes exactly that  which is symbolized by Flor letting out the buttons to Bernie's size eight jacket. Viola, now more than size 8!",Spanglish
129,pmakauloski2312,A poor finish negates what was a terrific Sandler movie,7,16 September 2015,"I really was surprised at the beginning of this film because it seemed so much different than the typical Sandler film. Sandler plays John, a Californian chef for a popular restaurant who is pretty much a normal chilled out guy married with 2 kids. Flor Moreno (Paz Vega), a poor single Mexican mother gets a housekeeping job at John's house. It was frustrating at times because Flor did not know any English so there were communication breakdowns. Flor's daughter, Cristina (Shelbie Bruce) lives at the house and acts as a translator for her mother. John's wife Deborah was tremendously acted in this film. She was crazy. It was a very annoying human but terrific acting by Tea Leoni. Deborah's alcoholic mother also lives at the estate but she doesn't really add much to the film. The movie was going along great and then it seemed to just derail with John and Deborah cheating on each other and Flor falling in love with John, John falling for Flor. Flor decides she doesn't want to get involved with John because it would ruin the marriage and so Flor and Cristina leave and go home. Cristina is forced to leave her private school that she had entered and she is crushed by it. 7.5/10 I enjoyed it overall but i was hoping it would go in a different direction.

The acting, direction, dialog, pacing, lighting, editing - ALL is excellent. An extremely entertaining and thought provoking film.I simply do not understand why this film did not receive more nominations and win more awards than it did. Is it just too uncomfortable for us Americans to see ourselves up on the big screen?Almost from the very beginning of the film I felt EVERY character was overly obsessed with themselves and treated everyone else as pets, except the pet dog. (The setting IS Los Angeles!) Every character lacked something or had lost something but wanted everything without real responsibility - until the very end. Then, one night, all the characters over 25 suddenly took responsibility for their actions and ""grew up."" At my age (mid 50's) you realize these ""gang"" realizations in families (although somewhat rare) really can happen!See the movie for yourself. Then, maybe you will become the catalyst for change in your own family.Update June 2019: Watched Spanglish again; probably the 8th time - every other year or so. Every time, as this time, the movie seems better than ever on all levels. Perhaps it is more relevant today than ever. A great masterpiece of a movie.

She decides to cross the border to start a new life with the daughter, who's narrating the story with special emphasis in skipping the details.Without subtitles when they speak Spanish (or English, depending which side is easier for you) the movie goes on and on as a sequence of lectures in moral and ethics sprinkled with some jokes (one or two actually funny) paying attention to little interactions but never delving into more serious or profound aspects of, just to mention a few, immigration, exploitation, mother-daughter pride, cultural collision and cultural differences expressing emotions.As an story, it is chopped and rushed, without conclusion and always leaving issues, either on purpose or by limitation, not finished, forcing the spectator to conclude the movie as he/she pleases which, in my case, dissolved the opportunity to connect and understand the motivations of the characters for their acts and decisions.Although refreshing in the fact of not stereotyping either side of the border, a movie that overall, is not an eye-opener, intellectual exercise of even a funny comedy, just another input into the massive amount of option for entertainment.",Spanglish

Paz Vega's Flor seems to do little actual work. And would someone as hard nosed as Tea Leone's Mrs Klasky have hired her on such an interview? But these are minor quibbles.What is terrific is that this movie manages to steer clear of the usual cliché ending. I admire the self-confidence of the script in this. Though we all love a happy ending, life does not often provide them.The two teenage girls will have, I hope, a long and distinguished career in films.

I'd seen the awful reviews for the film and planned to skip it, but peer pressure and lack of anything better to do on a Tuesday night won over and I did, in fact, see the film.Surprisingly, there are some interesting themes going on in Spanglish--the relationship between mothers and daughters, culture clash, work ethic, etc... all are present and had the potential to be developed into interesting motifs.Unfortunately, the film tried too hard to juggle between these ideas. The film feels crowded--too many characters, too many plot lines, too much talking. As a result, the pacing seems rushed and slow at the same time, lose ends are never tied up satisfactorily. The screenwriter, James L. Brooks, crammed in too many sub-plots and the result is a jumbled mess of flat characters, lame dialog, and little sense of closure.So I say this to Mr. Brooks: re-edit this film. Take out the superfluous characters and dialog and hone in on what you truly want the viewer to take from the film.

Of course, John was so warm and fuzzy, Flor was so warm and fuzzy (not to mention beautiful, of course) and Deborah (also quite attractive) was so cold and selfish that I found myself wanting John and Flor to live happily ever after.I have to give Tea Leoni credit. She was quite over the top as a self-consumed, spoiled, upper-middle class wife. I'm sure there are people this disgusting, but I don't think I've ever known one, thank God. Well, maybe one.Anyway, sometimes its good to wait for the video or even cable. I'm glad I didn't pay full fare to see this.",Spanglish

140,SampanMassacre,Class Envy Triangle,1,14 December 2007,"I was forced as a kid to go to church. Not like I didn't have fun at times but that was only when I ditched. When I sat there, being too young to understand anything, I didn't learn much. Now, older, I attend another church, having nothing to do with any God. It's the church of Hollywood. And films like ""Spaglish"" are the preachers. Class Envy 101. Here we go again. The rich are bad, the poor are good and honest. And these themes are always created and produced and directed by whom... the poor? I think not, they'd never be able to fund it. The plot here is about a nice rich guy and a mean rich woman, and a nice poor woman and a little girl caught in-between. The lesson at the end is that the rich are bad, except for the good-rich, that is, the artists (like those who make the movies... get it now?). Sandler plays a chef, ala a food artist, and his wife is a non-working socialite who is very fake. They hire a Spanish maid who is as proud as the wife is phony. And then throw into the mix an old lady who was once a jazz singer. She, being an artist with money, is also good. And the little girl, daughter of the maid whom Sandler's wife tries to ""adopt"", so to speak, ends up learning the hard way that if you're poor, you'll be much more honest than those kooky millionaires who live up on the hills, who don't have to wash their clothes on clothe-lines, and who make all the movies about how you, the poor, are the good guys. This was a horrible movie. It was worse than sitting through church as a kid - in fact, it wasn't much different. The church of Hollywood ends up with the same message, and I'm getting sick and tired of it.",Spanglish
141,Cammy-3,What to Do About This Mess? (One Spoiler),4,24 April 2005,"I was extremely disappointed in the latest offering from the wonderful writer and director James Brooks. It is difficult to believe or like ANY of the adult characters. First, poor Tea Leoni is the most hideous, narcissistic mother seen on film since the 1930's. Her husband is a wuss of monumental proportions and this couple, supposedly together since high school, communicate in nothing but Westside L.A. feel good code: They need their ""space;"" they ""validate"" feelings. It's as if they've spent their entire marriage in aroma therapy and self-esteem building classes.The gorgeous, thin Mexican maid -- and trust me, none of them look like her in Beverly Hills -- wears two hundred dollar blouses she could never afford and presents us with a portrait of almost saint like devotion to her only child. Then in the end, she refuses to allow the child to continue her education on scholarship at a private school. We are supposed to believe that this daughter went on to a public school I guess, on the other side of L.A. and ended up applying to Princeton? Puh-leese! Did anyone involved with this production visit a public school in L.A. recently? I attended one 30 years ago and my mother still teaches in the school system, which is now about 90% Hispanic and/or African American. The schools today are disaster areas with metal detectors, under-performing warehouses for the children of the poor that do not prepare their students for state college, much less the Ivy League.There were some great one liners and the two young girls who played the daughters are both excellent actresses, but all in all, this was a real mess -- and a miss by Brooks. It can't hold a candle to ""Terms of Endearment"" or even an old episode of Mary Tyler Moore.",Spanglish

But then I read reviews for the film and I learned that it was a dramedy. I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this film and then end was heart-breaking. I found myself crying at the end, because honestly, I can understand the mother's inner conflicts within. I thought that Paz Vega did a great job and the actresses who played Bernie and Christina were excellent. While they both seemed wise beyond their years, they still had a childlike innocence to them.

The comedy in the movie is great but the drama in the story is what really touched me, and made this quite a heartwarming movie. I loved Cloris Leachman!

This movie should be around a 7.6 on the IMDb scale.This is a great movie. Some of the reviews that rated this under a 7 were surprising, but they seemed to be from people that didn't understand it. And perhaps some of the low ratings are from people who feel this movie hits too close to home with the immigration laws and the ""threats"" that many people in the U.S. are worried about.But this movie is about real life of a migrator.It's a sweet movie, almost on the same level as ""To Be and to Have"".",Spanglish

The storyline is very immature and unrealistic. The Mexican maid is a goddess of everything and the only problem in her life is that she doesn't have the money! I'm sorry but to me this is just nonsense. Somebody please tell Adam Sandler that gone the days that audience was so passive that they'd believe anything on the screen! Nowadays it's hard to fool people by such phony story lines! A story line with a Mexican Cinderella Marry Poppins who is literally a goddess in everything , from looks and brains to kinetic skills is not believable! The rule of writing says when you're creating a reality for the audience that reality must be believable. The same old story of a nagging rich housewife , a poor perfection as the maid and the great man of the house in between two is so 1950s! Another criticism I have is about it's genre. They say it's a comedy. Can somebody show me comedy in this film ? The budget for this film was 80 Millions USD ( yes that big! ) and this film only made half of that in the box office. This fact alone proves my point of view! My rating ? Oh well, Do you have anything less than 1 or worse than awful? cause that will be my rating !",Spanglish

You start with some character building for the Clasky children which is pointless as it takes you nowhere - why even comment on their son? His character does nothing.

Vega is stunningly beautiful and draws you into the screen with her great work. Even though she doesn't speak much English in the movie, she was able to communicate to the audience with her amazing facial expressions and actions. She has a great smile and eyes that tell you a lot about what's on her mind. Cloris Leachman and Tea Leoni also have great mother-daughter relationship, especially in the final scenes. There are some comedic parts in the movie but nothing like in Sandler's previous movies. Spanglish is very dramatic. Almost like a soap opera. It definitely is a more favorable movie for the ladies and couples but you will learn a lot about a mother's love towards her daughter and vice versa.

I fell in love with Paz Vega's character, Flor. I applaud Jim Brook's decision to cast an actress, who like the character, does not speak any English. I feel it gave a deeper sense of reality to the film. I was also very impressed with Sarah Steele's performance as the overweight daughter, Bernice. Her smile lit up the screen! Do I think this is a great movie? Depends what you consider a great movie to be. It is NOT a movie in which the ending resolves all issues, neither does it make you think or reflect on your own life repeatedly after viewing it. However, it does make you laugh, cry, and lose yourself within the characters and situations for 2 hours.

151,theweffy,"Premise good, bad movie overall",4,25 August 2018,"Good premise with some cute moments but overall a bit awkward and definitely forced.A sweet but weak man is married to a controlling and complete psychotic woman who is verbally abusive to their daughter and dismissive of their son (although to be fair you hardly notice the kid is there, bad writing). A supposedly impoverished yet well-dressed and impeccably groomed gorgeous and kind housekeeper who doesn't speak English is hired by this weird sad family and when the mom offers her job she kisses her on the mouth. Wtf I'm telling you that mom is weird. I know you need a job but you're already #metoo'd in the interview maybe don't work there?A bunch of nonsense happens, they get a beach house, the mom of the family tries to basically adopt the housekeeper's daughter against her moms will and gets her put into the same private school as her kids. None of that made sense, they suggest it's because the housekeepers daughter is pretty and that lady's daughter isn't. I'm telling you this freak is a total monster. Oh also the housekeeper learns English while she keeps house. The dad and the housekeeper have like two choppy conversations about their children. And then we are supposed to accept she's fallen in love with him. Okay. Then we find out psycho mom has been cheating. Finally! Leave that bag of crazy and don't look back. No. He just has a painfully awkward date with housekeeper at his restaurant. Yes this deflated balloon of a man has somehow found the wherewithal to start and maintain a successful business. Sure. Then he goes home, we are led to believe he's upset yet but willing to work on his terrible depressing awful marriage. Oh and then former housekeeper (she quits) pulls her kid out of a full scholarship at private school and yet that kid still gets in to Princeton. Okay sure. It's not a great movie.

She is a woman driven by the need to overcome whatever hurdles, be it poverty or ostentatiousness, to allow her daughter the best chance in this world to succeed. This is a simple film about a few of those hurdles, the beautiful woman who captains the journey, the people she meets along the way at one specific and significant juncture, and the gratitude and pride expressed by the woman's daughter at the journey's end. This is not rocket science. It's a small film for adults, told from an adult perspective, with contrasting performances by Leoni, Sandler, Leachman, and Vega.

153,kmukh_73,Superb Screenplay and Acting,9,5 April 2005,"I recently saw this movie in DVD. When it was released last year, I did not pay heed to this one, as I thought it would be another: (a) Typical slapstick comedy, (b) I don't like Adam Sandler too much (c) I have to read Spanish subtitles for some of the dialogs (as I had seen the trailer earlier)But....Oh Boy...thank God I had seen this movie. I had been wrong in my decisions very few times, and watching this movie was one such occasion.Spanglish focuses a very tight yet true storyline, of two cultures. The bit conservative as well as protective culture of a Mexican mom and a reluctant easy-going, rich American family. The cultural as well as lingual difference is majestically portrayed. It also focuses the needs and essentials of tow different cultures.I can feel this as I am an Indian, and i know, from our childhood how we have been taken care of our parents; and in our eyes we had just one dream: The Princeton-like Dream. Education is/was the first and foremost in society and culture. Even a maid's sibling, if is brilliant, the whole society back his/her education costs. But what we do lack is the knowledge to come our of the protective shield of our parents and be independent. So it's not like the non-American cultures can simply go ga ga ga over their cultures. Both has some pros and cons and we must mix and learn and acquire the best.Well coming to this film, if we study the film in-depth, you will have all the answers to the questions and you will see one of the finest differences in cultures portrayed in such a nice way.You can see an American mom and dad, vs the Mexican mom and her struggle to raise her daughter who is growing older. You can see how nicely American children accepts a new kid as friends. But that does not mean all American parents raise their children in the same way or all Mexican, Indian, Chinese etc etc parents are so good parents. There are always exceptions, but director has taken an average family life one from American and the other from a single working Mexican mom.But I must say, if the cultures were not different, one did not have the chance to reprimand their faults, learn new things, mix with others a societal boost. Well that comes in one part of the movie when, Pas Vega tells Adam that she has never thought that Adam would nor react to her statement. Well as the director has showed the good side of a Mexican woman, he also showed the part on the American father.Adam Sandler was perfect in the cast, so was Deborah..but my winner for the movie is PAZ VEGA. I saw her earlier movie, SEX and LUCIA where she gave a brilliant cast, and this was her second one. I think she was 10/10 in her character and role playing as a non-English speaking Mexican single working mom.Guys, if u had not seen this movie because of the same reason as I had skipped, don;t make the mistake. This is a wonderful and exceptional movie. I liked the overall presentation as a letter been sent to Princeton and the story being told thereafter, brilliant idea, acting and ending.",Spanglish
154,CapRising,Glad it was a freebie.,2,4 June 2005,"I can forgive a lot of flaws in a movie, but whew, this one was bad. I can't think of worse casting than Sandler. Everybody else was great (well, Cloris Leachman took the drunk-mom cliché about as far as it would go), but Sandler's presence here ruined it. ""50 First Dates"" worked a lot better for him -- the semi-goofy guy who manages to charm the lady by virtue of his imperfection. Here, he's trying to be a charming saint of a married chef, ""doing the best he can,"" not having any idea of how attractive he is to a woman. The only problem is, he's NOT attractive. I felt no chemistry between Flor and John. The whole concept of one culture finding a common ground just gets lost here. This is mainly because Sandler is so completely inarticulate, it's very hard to believe that a woman who's barely learned English can understand anything he says. Two devices that repeat themselves over and over here are 1-Sandler suddenly shouting out something in the middle of a conversation, which either scares Flor or amuses her, and 2-Sandler yelling ""Whoa, wait-wait-wait..."" every time a conversation is about to reach its merciful conclusion and the other person is trying to walk away gracefully.Leoni does a good job with Deborah, but still, her character is so two-dimensional. We get no sense of why she's so dysfunctional. Meredith Baxter-Birney did a much better job in a Lifetime TV movie about a bulimic. I think someone must have watched that movie and tried to model Leoni's character after it.I would have liked to see more of Flor's side of town, to give it added depth.

One of the things I appreciated was that there were no long speeches in front of a crowd like in his previous stuff. The Hispanic culture was portrayed well. The only thing that annoyed me was that Tea Leoni's character was too one-dimensional. It's a great family film. Sandler usually does some cheesy movies, but this is quality movie making.

I have seen this one so many times on DVD and HBO and I always stop on it if channel surfing. Soem people can write novels on a single piece of artwork after staring at it for hours and whatever this movies has, its worked that same magic within me. The subtle humor, the range of interesting personality conflicts, the superb acting and, most of all, the technique of bringing things to a brink and then backing off when most other cinematic features think gratuitous nudity, language, et. al., is the paycheck people always want, is refreshing. I like a little nudity but when Flor is standing in the beach breeze and he tells her forcefully to get out of it, I got the message (and the thrill of seeing Paz!) in my imagination while appreciating his wholesome choice to remain true to his vows. She is one the most beautiful women to the eye and in her character and that ideal was preserved while providing one of the most empathetic moments without real sex I've ever seen in a movie before.Frailty in human characters, well-acted by all, balanced comedy/drama so well-blended a neurosurgeon couldn't separate it and an approach to telling a story that makes you wish you were part of the cast/crew, that's what this has.

158,mambo771975,"A word about ""opportunity""...",7,23 January 2005,"I've read several comments criticizing ""Spanglish"" for perpetrating stereotypes about Anglos as being somehow evil, and Hispanics being foolish for allowing their children to bypass opportunities like spending the summer in a beach house in Malibu or attending an exclusive academy...While I can see that on the surface, one may get that impression, I believe that there's more subtle forces at work in the story. Deborah (Tea Leoni) is a neurotic and deeply unhappy woman, who uses her cast-iron will to control and overpower everyone in her world. She quickly latches onto Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), the housekeeper's daughter, beautiful and brilliant, making her a surrogate child to remind her own daughter that she's overweight and by comparison, unattractive; a disappointment to her shallow and insensitive mother.She then appropriates Cristina, taking her out for a ""treat"", but in reality, its Deborah disrespecting boundaries and seeking to insert herself between Cristina and her mother, Flor (Paz Vega). She is utterly dismissive to the offense taken by Flor, who correctly reads the power grab, and to the cruel slight to Berniece, her own daughter.Despite Flor's assertive demand to not offer any more such manipulative ""gifts"" to Cristina, Deborah doggedly sets up a way to get Cristina into the exclusive academy her own children attend.What is perhaps not obvious to someone not familiar with the Hispanic culture, is the reverence with which children are held. The beautiful intimacy and trust between Flor and Cristina is testament to that bond. Flor isn't fooled by Deborah's ""generosity"". She realizes that Deb is jealous of their bond, and uses every tool she has to insert herself in the relationship, blatantly using Cristina as a tool to tweak the noses of Flor and Berniece(Sarah Steele). Deborah isn't interested in Cristina's future; she uses anyone, anytime for her manipulation and control, all the time being the most out of control character in the story.The story isn't about making Anglos look ""evil"" or Hispanics look ""foolish"". It is about people who make things more important than family, about letting go and trusting that there's something to hold onto, right in your own home.",Spanglish

162,strus2001,Curious but compelling,9,1 January 2005,"There were a few aspects of this movie I found puzzling. 1) Why would this family, although obviously successful in the restaurant business, hire a full-time domestic with a tag-a-long daughter, when the wife is spectacularly physically fit and the freeloading mother-in-law have such an excess of free time on their hands that they invariably create trouble for themselves and everyone else? 2) Why can't the father, who is acknowledged as the ""best working chef in the USA"" develop a healthy diet for his overweight daughter? That being said, why doesn't the mother, a self acknowledged college track star, take the child along on her daily runs?That being said, the core conflicts of the story were compelling and often hilarious. It was not substantially different than the themes used in ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" or ""Fresh Prince of BelAir."" An individual, or family, is relocated into an environment of unimagined affluence, and the process of adaptation begins, with humor and bilateral education. There is an all too willing attitude in the entertainment industry to marginalize and cartoonize and buffoonize the hardworking Caucasian family man, and by doing so, to sanctify the life of the American woman. In reality we all know better; people come in widely different personalities and moralities, some with high integrity and others slither with the snakes regardless of the hardware between their legs.I loved the way Adam Sandler played John, the father, a man who gives 100% for his family who he loves unapologetically, even when they make him want to tear his hair out. Here is a man who is the moral center of his family, who in any other film he has been in would be flying off the handle. It was satisfying to see a man fight the good fight of staying faithful, staying sane, staying calm when there were innumerable opportunities to lose it.Having had an opportunity to visit Central America, the characters of Flor and Christina, resonated strong and true for myself. There are millions of people in these struggling countries who will never realize the opportunities and wealth that we Americans too often take for granted. They know it too - but are not bitter. What impressed me the most in my visit was how they value love and friendship and family above any material possessions. That core sensitivity is what held this mother and daughter together through thick and thin and is what made this movie work.",Spanglish

He plays a truly decent man, trying to understand and do what's best for the nutty women around him. There is humor in his performance, but it comes largely from his reactions to the other actors. No goofiness or pratfalls. He is a great dramatic actor.All of the characters are drawn in detail. All of the acting lets you lose yourself in the film. The thing I liked the best was the sense that the characters were really trying to do the right thing, as they saw it. Of course their frailties get in the way.

Compared to other Sandler classics like ""The Wedding Singer,"" ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Mr. Deeds,"" this film leans towards the drama genre. I noticed this at the beginning of the film, and didn't at all mind (I don't mean to come across as someone who dislikes drama - I'm a huge Ingmar Bergman fan), but this movie just didn't keep me interested throughout, though the first half of the film had me wide awake - at some point after that I thought to myself ""hey, didn't I already watch this scene...?"" In the movie Sandler is married to an always stressed and hysteric wife who, though unemployed, has to hire a (Spanish) house keeper. The house keeper can't speak a word English, and so, through all the translation by the house keepers daughter, a ""Spanglish"" language is born (well, kinda). There aren't any ""HAA HAA highlights"" (no scenes you could watch over and over again,) but the idea for the movie (unlike the abrupt and surprisingly STUPID ending) is really good. I don't want to give anything away, but the moral speech and ""big decision"" that is made at the very end of the film surprised me and others who watched it. Nobody seemed to understand or appreciate the 180 degree turn the movie suddenly took at the last 30 seconds... ...a good idea for a movie, but it could be re-done better with a few changes.

166,CarlosFacundoCornejo,A Lesson On How To Make A Good Story Into A Bad Movie,4,22 July 2005,"I think that this movie would give us a lesson, about ""how to make a good story into a bad movie"", also, it would give us the lesson on ""how not to do movies"", i think that the story at first would work, but unfortunately, the actors screwed it up, it just aberrant, the way they act, it's like they are over-acting all the situations...also the script has a big mistake: the kids, usually have more complicated dialogs and interactions than the adults, it makes it look like there is some kind of incoherency, some times it make the adults looks like stupid in this movie, and make the kids looks very smart.Paz Vega does an awful job in this movie, she show us that she can't act anymore, she should return to his previous life job (doesn't matter what she was doing before).Tea Leoni screwed up his career with this poor performance, it has no point of comparison with her previous work, especially compared to The Family Man and Deep Impact.The only one one that still makes this movie ""entertaining"" is Adam Sandler, with his good work, not the best acting he did, but certainly not the worst too, his role is pretty good, and he can handle with it, too bad that the other actors (and actresses) were not at his height... 4/10 just because the story could be good",Spanglish
167,VietDo,constantly surprised,9,14 November 2005,"Spanglish took a theme that assimilation is not always the best of things, that losing your identity, the culture, language, and a parent's sacrifice so that their children can succeed. I think the scene stealer was Cristina, played by Shelbie Bruce. She is a star in the making, and showed more range than other child prodigy actors. I would suggest that she is one to look out for. The cinematography was amazing, and to suggest this, that Adam Sandler can have fans that like him in both his dumb and brilliant roles. Just realize that a good portions of his fan base were high schoolers back in the early nineties, and are now ones that are pushing 30's. That he has grown as an actor much like his fans have grown into adult hood. So yes, I for one do not mind it both ways to have a good comedy like the wedding singer (yes I remember the 80's) and then to have a movies like Spanglish and a movie I have yet to see, Punch-Drunk Love. Tea Leoni was good as the superficial wife and Paz Vega was awesome as the housekeeper/mother. Sarah Steele also is one to look out for as she grows and gets bigger roles. Cloris Leachman is definitely a actress that makes you feel that she is a throwback to past days. I wish I could comment more but the scenes at the restaurant were brilliantly cinematography and wonderful acting even in bits.",Spanglish

They hire a Mexican woman (Paz Vega) to help around the house - one who speaks only a little English. the interactions between Sandler & Vega are incredible. They have a chemistry similar to Sandler & Drew Barrymore (wedding singer, 50 1st dates). they bond because they understand that they are both in the same situation, trying to make the best of a life that isn't what they thought it would be.The real stars of this movie are Vega (Flor), Shelbie Bruce (who plays her daughter Christina) and Sarah Steele (Sandler's daughter, Bernie). They steal the show, with Bruce acting as a Flashback-voice-over narrator for the movie.

170,pokerfjes,A moment of clarity,8,2 May 2005,"Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni, rated as Comedy/Romance and Drama. Well, doesn't quite sound like a great movie, does it? But much to my surprise, this movie shows an aspect of life that I personally value highly. The theme of who you are, and who you want to be, is something I think fewer and fewer of us actually give the attention it deserves.In our lives, certain moments define us. Certain events shape the way we see things, the way we act towards others and the way we conduct our lives. This movie gives a great portrayal of how genuinely big these moments can be, and also how the small moments can make immense changes. Events that there and then might not seem important, become the moments you later discover made you who you are.Adam Sandler pulls out a believable performance, not pushing the comedy thing too far. Teo Leoni might be a bit too much at times, but who is to say that desperate housewives don't act insane? The real star in this movie though, is Paz Vega. Her performance as the Mexican mother who moves to LA with a daughter, is as stunning as it feels real. The plot, one might say, is not too elaborate, but is that really necessary? Does one have to be all Stanley Kubrick or David Lynch about life? I think this movie touches upon a much needed subject. In todays society, we need to stop and think for a moment. We need to feel, to love and to experience true love and pain. Yes, it sounds all romantic and touchy feely, but we have lost something. We as social beings are beginning to lose what defines us as humans; the ability to interact, to be social, to feel sympathy and empathy. And this movies takes us, or at least me, into that moment where you remember what it was like growing up. Where you started to lose that childish innocence. When you started to become harder on the inside.You may find this comment downright offensive, or you might think ""hey, he's actually got a point"". Either way, being a ""sensitive"" guy, as they say, cried during this movie. Cried, because I recognize the feelings displayed, and the pain they experience. I too, have let go of someone, when it felt like the only sane thing was to hold on to each other. Maybe you should cry once in a while too. Who knows, it might do you good.",Spanglish

The acting is natural. If there was music, it didn't distract. It provokes laughter, empathy, but also thought. It isn't too heavy nor too shallow. It didn't drag. It had social commentary, characters instead of caricatures and no easy answers yet steered clear of pat answers and of harshness. Where I saw it, ranked it as family fare and while there is no violence, emotional or physical, the concepts of adult decisions may not be interesting to children. I don't know how it compares to the 1994 movie by the same title but this one is not typical Hollywood fare.",Spanglish

The film was well written and directed - constructed tightly and with an ending that was far from conventional.It deserved a Best Film and Best Director nomination for its freshness and quality.The total package is much better and quite different than the standard Hollywood output.

It was quiet enough that I couldn't make out what she said at first, so I rewound it and turned up the volume. I wish I had not done that. When I realized what she had said, it struck me as the saddest thing I have heard in a long time.I guess I should thank the actors and the director for stirring up in me some raw emotion. It just caught me off guard. I wasn't sure what to do with myself. I knew at that moment that this movie wasn't going to have a traditional happy Hollywood ending. I don't know if the film is better off for that. I really wanted John and Flor to have a happy ending.",Spanglish
175,Consul_Incitatus,Phony Mexicans and annoying gringos; doesn't work as comedy or drama,3,9 December 2006,"I guess some of my disappointment with this movie stems with the fact that I didn't read any reviews of it but went in expecting the usual silly, crude, fun Adam Sandler flick. Happy Gilmore this is not. It really isn't all that funny, although it apparently tries to be. Its also trying to be a drama, but it has the lack of believability of most comedies without being very funny.Its about an illegal Mexican immigrant woman with a daughter who gets a job as a maid for a family of emotionally dysfunctional upper middle class white people. The Mexican maid, however, is played by a ridiculously gorgeous Spanish actress who is totally unconvincing as a poor Mexican maid. I have lived in Mexico, I have had Mexican neighbors and co-workers, the Mexicans in this movie did not seem authentic at all. They seemed like some rich Hollywood guy's uninformed stereotype, albeit a favorable one.And the American family I found just plain irritating- especially the loud-mouthed, neurotic mom. I didn't identify or sympathize with any of them, but just wished they'd go away. Maybe it would resonate more with me if I was around more affluent Beverly Hills types; but being from more of a lower middle class Midwestern background these people seemed like total aliens. Thus, the culture contrast aspect of the movie fell flat for me.In general, the whole movie seemed phony and contrived to me. I can put up with this in a dumb comedy or special-effects blockbuster, but this had none of those compensations.Anyway, if you want a good movie about illegal immigrants going to LA, watch ""El Norte""- a very authentic and genuinely moving film (although it has some laughs too).",Spanglish
176,nmarshi,Spanglish-Lost in Translation,6,3 January 2005,"For the first hour of Spanglish I was in love: in love with Paz Vega, with the characters, with the plot.I live in Los Angeles, not far both geographically and socio-economically from the Bel-Air based family which is the center of the story. Brooks' observations of Los Angeleno attitudes and concerns are spot on, and amusing to boot. For a while, I could look beyond the terrible miscasting of Adam Sandler as the father of this dysfunctional family. I was rooting for Sandler to continue his transition from clown to actor, but it didn't happen in Spanglish. No mind, Cloris Leachman is terrific as the alcoholic grandma with a heart of gold matched with a wicked tongue. Paz Vega is just tremendous as are all the children in the movie. Even Tea Leoni, whom I usually detest in everything she does, brings a fierce, daring characterization to her part.Then it all falls apart in the third act. The humor largely takes a bus out of town, and we're left with a long, meandering, half baked denouement (I'm trying really hard to not give anything anyway). We're treated to a couple of homilies, and a number of unresolved plot lines as if director Brooks ran out of time or interest. In my opinion, the basic problem is that Brooks couldn't decide who the movie was about: the speak no English gorgeous cleaning lady from Mexico (Paz Vega) or the Adam Sandler headed Anglo family whom she works for.",Spanglish
177,graafics2,Surprisingly disappointing,2,27 December 2004,"I had pretty high expectations for this film after seeing excerpts and after seeing Roger Ebert's and this site's user comments rating. I've enjoyed Adams Sandler's (somewhat goofy) performances in past films, and have a high regard for Tea Leoni's and Cloris Leachman's acting abilities.Why didn't I like the film? Two main reasons I think - first, in some cases the director failed to develop the characters sufficiently for me to take an interest (in particular Tea Leoni's character, but also Adam Sandler's). They seemed superficial. Secondly, the conversations between the characters often seemed very contrived and ""unreal"" - as though the words were there only to have something to say. I kept shaking my head throughout the film, thinking ""they wouldn't really say that under these circumstances"".Both issues had me frequently checking my watch to see how much longer the film was going to be - it was really irritating. I seriously considered leaving early and waiting for my family outside the theater until the film ended. We all agreed it was a very disappointing film. Obviously others don't agree - hopefully you'll like it. Cloris Leachman's performance was the highlight for me, but she played a small role.",Spanglish

Firstly, it was really long at 131 minutes, but all the deleted scenes left out important bits that would have made it easier to understand. T'ea Leoni's character, Deborah Clasky, is so unlikable that it was nothing but a caricature. Adam Sandler's character, John Clasky, was just befuddled. I couldn't understand how any mom could have a wonderful, beautiful child like Bernice and just ignore her. Georgie was so glossed over that we had to watch the deleted scenes to find out why his mom was mad at him (for refusing to perform in front of company like a trained seal.) Paz Vega as Flor and the three kid actors were great. The sex scene between Deborah and John pointed out how totally self-occupied Deborah was, but it was really disturbing and I could have lived just fine without seeing it. I had looked forward to seeing this movie for a long time, and was really disappointed. Good editing could have made this movie really great. Too bad.",Spanglish
180,carlosdev,Speaking in Tongues,7,11 April 2005,"Director James L. Brooks is not the most prolific of directors (this is his first directorial effort in seven years), but the five movies he has helmed are an impressive resume; ""Terms of Endearment,"" ""Broadcast News,"" ""As Good as It Gets"" and now this surprising comedy. Single mother Flor Moreno (the wonderful Spanish actress Paz Vega) works two jobs to support herself and her precocious daughter Cristina (Shelbie Bruce), but realizes she needs a better job that will allow her to spend more time with her offspring. She finds it as a maid/nanny for the Clasky family. Father John (Adam Sandler) is a world-class chef who is, rather than being arrogant and self-absorbed, turns out to be sweet and giving. Mother Deborah (Tea Leoni) is a world-class neurotic who tries to do the right thing for her obese daughter Bernice (Sarah Steele) but manages to do the wrong thing every time out. She latches onto Cristina as having more potential than her daughter. Deborah's mother Evelyn (Cloris Leachman), a fading torch singer, drinks herself into numbness, but watches her daughter squander away everything with meaning in her life. Flor comes into this world, with her wisdom and humor, but is slowly sucked into the morass of Deborah's neuroses and John's increasing helplessness. Vega is quite stellar here. She imbues Flor with life and sensuality, but never makes her a cartoon. Brooks makes sure that Flor doesn't become a super-nanny who heals all the household's ills; in fact, by the film's conclusion, this household is still in much pain, but the people in it are dealing with their problems as opposed to ignoring them. Flor is more of a catalyst than a cure. Sandler does especially well here, in his best performance since ""The Wedding Singer,"" playing to his strengths as a sweetheart of a guy without dissolving into treacle. Brooks keeps Sandler from mugging as he is sometimes prone to doing. Leoni has the most difficult performance, making Deborah a real person with a good heart deep down, rather than letting the neuroses define her performance. It's a difficult task, but Leoni manages to bring sympathy to an otherwise unsympathetic part. You can't ask for more than that. Leachman makes a welcome return to the screen, keeping Evelyn from becoming a characiture. There is growth in the characters here, yes, but it is growth with a price, as growth generally is in reality, which makes the movie ring true. If the Claskies are the perfect family in appearance, it just goes to show that even the perfect family can have problems. A surprisingly good movie worth checking out on DVD.",Spanglish

A guy with a golden heart. A good, understanding husband. A great father. Make us feel for his character. As always, he is good.Tea Leoni is superb as frustrated, nagging wife.Cloris Reachman provides few laughs and she's a delight to watch.Highly recommend.",Spanglish
182,kvonnegut,Interesting Social Commentary - SPANGLISH?,8,30 December 2004,"SPANGLISH - a term with negative connotation to numerous Spanish-Americans (or at least to the first generation or older immigrants).As the title implies, the movie makes a very interesting and subtle social commentary about the Mexican American dynamics/contrast in society. Obviously as expected, the film illustrates a few stereotypes. For example, when Florrr's (played by Paz Vega) cousin, Cecilia hit the sliding glass door and her nose bled, the wife Deborah Clasky (played by Tia Leone) offered her money instead. It's sad but true in today's society.But what make the film interesting are its subtleties. For instance the casting and the characters itself. The producers could have hired a blonde blue eyed male lead instead of Adam Sandler, but they did not. Why? Because Sandler's character (John Clasky) is an antithesis of the wife, Deborah Clasky. She's blonde blue eyed superficial, emotionally disturbed, patronizing, solipsistic, white housewife, who the writer ( Brooks )probably wants to portray as the epitome of everything that is bad about white people - or Americans for that matter (however exaggerated they portrayed her to be). You can empathize with the husband's character and Adam Sandler played it very well. It's interesting to note, the husbands character's last name is Clasky - possibly his ancestors were immigrants as well. And his character is portrayed as someone who ""gets it"", someone who understands Florrr - an immigrant mother who wants her daughter raised with her own values and integrity even though she is only a lowly servant to the Clasky's.One of the interesting scenes in the film that I found very clever was the argument between Florrrr and John. It showed the two sides of the dynamic. While I was watching it I thought to myself, any other individual would immediately apologize and patronize the immigrant housemaid in the expense of goodwill. But I was surprised that Sandler's character actually called her a ""hypocrite"" instead, and she realized he has a point. Not to criticize her (it's probably what Deborah would have done) would be hypocritical as well. This is another social commentary that was written very well and cleverly portrayed in the film.The acting is equally superb. You could just hate some of the characters specially the housewife and the daughter Cristina Moreno (played by Shelbie Bruce). You can just empathize with Adam Sandler's character and his daughter, Bernice. The only people amongst the Claskys that is very adult. The grandmother's character on the other hand (played by Cloris Leachman ) whose always drinking provides a respite to the insanity in the story and ironically always the unobtrusive and yet emphatic character despite how she lived her life. In the end she was the voice of reason for the wife.Equally, the dialogue is worth mentioning. Interestingly, there are no subtitles on all the Spanish spoken dialogue but the audience can kind of get the gist of what's being said or argued. It can be distracting to some audiences but thankfully, Florrr's character learned to speak English in the second half of the film. Also, the Spanish without subtitles added a few good scenes in the film and added a positive credence to the title SPANGLISH. It illustrates how to write the quintessential part of the screenplay without making it too cliché.Overall, I liked this film. If you can look at it in the same light as I saw the film, you would enjoy it too and find it cleverly written and directed. Otherwise, it could be a little slow and the dialogue can be a little bit distracting. It doesn't help some of it is in Spanish and Adam sandler's character cannot express himself very well verbally.",Spanglish

I was not disappointed and felt overall this was an interesting movie, especially for a ""comedy"" (a genre I don't watch much of). The movie delved into values at several different levels and how they played out both from the immigrant's perspective of entering a new culture and from an interpersonal perspective where couples are involved. While I did find Sadler to be slightly less than believable in his role (perhaps a result of my negative impression of him, or more accurately the characters he played, in other films), his performance showed more range than I expected. I found myself drawn to Paz Vega's character and not simply due to her physical appeal. Her dilemma seemed to be a very real one, one I could relate to having had immigrant grandparents.

187,physman,"A few good moments, but not enough",5,5 December 2005,"Spanglish's ensemble cast moves through a dozen or more subplots over the movie's 131 minutes, but only a few of those subplots work. Adam Sandler is a big source of the movie's problems. He is at best horribly miscast, and at worst simply horrible. He is totally unbelievable as a world-class chef (""the best chef in America"" shows no passion for his work!). And there is zero chemistry between him and his wife (Tea Leoni) or between him and his new romantic interest (Paz Vega). As a result, all the romance and marital distress material in the script falls flat.On the other hand, the story involving the complex relationships between Leoni, Vega, and Vega's daughter was compelling. And the movie's ending was satisfying -- and that's saying a lot.Still, the good parts are few and far between, and most of movie's running time is bogged down in family drama involving a completely unbelievable family.",Spanglish

He has made fine movies like Terms of Endearment and Broadcast news which remain among my all-time favorites. I didn't see this one at the movies but had wanted to so when the DVD became available I quickly went out and rented it. The movie starts out kind of hokey but the charm of Paz Vega saves the film early on. The over-the-top acting of Tea Leoni who seemed like she was either seriously over-caffeinated or on speed through much of the film. At times she spoke so fast she was incoherent. I just couldn't help but feel she didn't jive with where the character needed to be emotionally in the film. It almost felt like read her lines with this ""I need to do this and get the hell out of here"" feeling. Maybe Duchovny was honking in the parking lot? Adam Sandler floated through the role without passion and without his usual charm that he brings to most roles. His screen presence is usually so entertaining it's makes up for the fact that he can't really act. Not in this one folks. He seemed just confused through most of the film. There was zero chemistry between his character and Leoni's and very little between him and Vega ( who was so passionate and involving light bulbs popped as she walked by), so it lead me to believe from the get go that the casting was just terrible! The screenplay had it's merits and there were a few bits of dialog that grabbed you albeit the delivery (Adam Sandler) of the line seemed awkward and almost weird due to his timing and conjured up emotion. I hate to say it but the direction was flawed. Most of the actors with the exception of comic genius Leachman and the amazing Paz Vega seemed misguided and bored with their roles. I give the film a 5/10 simply because of Paz Vega who makes the film worth getting through.",Spanglish

The interactions of the two families involved is fun and touching... and that part alone is good enough for me to rate it well. After awhile, though, the writer just seemed to run low on plot.

I often got frustrated and screamed, ""what?!""... it was quirky and unrealistic. Sometimes the quirkiness adds to the charm of the movie (like Being John Malkovich), here it felt really fake. Like it was trying to match Sideways from a Mexican American point of view.Here's my other problem with it. The realism of having a tall, skinny, light-skinned Mexican woman with no boyfriend and a wonderfully behaved kid working as a live-in housekeeper just seems like a male fantasy trying to play reality. I mean, how realistic is that? The acting was average at best, but a really poor performance by the daughter of Adam Sandler's character (sometimes you can see her trying to cover up a smile while getting angry).While I tried to like this movie and the story definitely had a lot of potential, there were major problems and this one had a snore factor. Some things could have been explored more, like the dad's relationship with the kids (you rarely saw how they bonded) and the stupid dog thing could have been cut.

However the movie is looses its steam half way through the third act and the ending, although perfect for the story, is unfulfilling. Also the voice over narration is unnecessary and annoying. It is still watchable though because of the well written characters.I would wait to see it on cable.",Spanglish
194,harryandsally,my classic,10,3 November 2014,"I am still in awe of this movie's clear writing and spotless plot that moves me every time. I love the words of this film, both Spanish and English. Subtle, tender, beautiful picture of the complicated world behind the doors of a family's home. Each actor embodies his/her role so well. James Brooks really took the time to make this movie time-tested and something very special.My favorite scene is in the restaurant with Adam Sandler and Paz Vega. It is poetic and bittersweet and real and so beautifully done. Him describing her beauty, him setting his glass of vodka down, their feet almost toughing the floor, each moment takes you to where they are. This love that cannot be. I loved Spanglish before I had kids, and now that I have kids it is even more poignant. Touches on the hard aspects of parenting, being a spouse, and being a kid.",Spanglish
195,yeojennifer,A very sweet film,8,29 December 2004,"I enjoyed Spanglish very much. No one was unbelievably perfect or beautiful. The story was very real. Family stories can be saccharine sweet or very sad, but this one seemed to really touch on all the trials and tribulations of living with people who love you but don't understand anything about you. The different dynamics between Adam Sandler's character with that of his wife and his daughter were very plausible and extremely poignant. I really enjoyed the relationship between Flor and Christina. It was very realistic and sweet.Having spent time in Latin America, families appear to be much closer than here in Noth America. I will definitely recommend it to my friends and go to see it again.Jenn",Spanglish

But I think it worked a wee too hard at approaching in communicability with the audience. The Spanish lead looks and speaks just like Penelope Cruz, so that is obviously a bonus. I just don't really understand the point of the film. When did the rich Chef ever hook up with the broken wife, when were their good times? How did their mother become an alcoholic and move in with them. Why is the daughter of this train-wreck of a mom such a great little girl. What the heck? Why did this movie cost $75 million to make? And $45 million more for production ads? What a bomb, they spent more promoting it than they even made, I think it was all on Sandler's salary, who I just don't get as an actor.

Cloris Leachman was good but Tea Leoni was just plain IRRITATING! The daughter was so over the top it was embarrassing! AND by the end of the film you forgot all about the second child!

Adam Sandler is perfect as the husband of a wacko Tea Leoni and the father of an overweight daughter, who even at a young age has issues with her mom. By the end of the movie, you love Adam Sandler and hate Tea Leoni. His interaction with his daughter is tear jerking. Paz Vegas is also wonderful as their newly hired housekeeper/nanny. Her special connection with Sandler's daughter, as well as the interaction with her own daughter. The script helps to understand the situation that she is in with her daughter and the things a single-mother will do to protect her daughter. It also shows an immigrants fight to keep her own culture a part of her and her daughter. This movie is very good and I would recommend it, but take tissues because it is a tearjerker.",Spanglish
199,braidstane,nice twist,10,7 May 2005,"I don't know why they titled this movie ""Spanglish"". The term has nothing to do with the movie. Also, the movie is not a dyed in the wool comedy even thought Adam Sandler has the lead. Those in charge really did not do the movie any justice in the way it was advertised to the public. This is a romantic movie but it is far from being a drama. A nice romantic story with a twist is the way it should have been advertised.Now, with that out of the way, let's talk about the story and the actors. I thought the movie was beautifully written and had enough twists in the plots to keep you wanting more and going away satisfied with the ending ... which was not typical as these things can be. Adam Sandler did a fine job with his role and showed that being stupidly funny is not the extent of his acting ability. I felt his performance helped to make this movie one that you would not only recommend to a friend but would actually watch a second or even a third time.It was good to see Tea Leoni back at work.Cloris Leachman ... what can you say. She is a truly great actress that I believe has never gotten the credit for her depth and talent.The newcomer who played the female lead (forgive me ... I've forgotten her name but will be sure to look it up and remember it for the future ... is beautiful as well as talented ... in 2 languages.Do I like this movie? Yes. Would I see it again? Yes.

The movie seemed very well-balanced and true-to-life, which make a movie charming, and this certainly fits that bill. Sure, there were some parts that seemed contrived, but that's why I gave it only a 10, instead of an 11. All the main characters were believable, the dialog was perfect, and the tension exactly right. Go see this movie, or rent it. Or buy it, and lend it to all your friends and relatives.

201,allamericangirl,Another Look at Spanglish,9,19 April 2005,"Since there was only one other comment on this movie, and it's written by a Brit who may not understand what it means to live in LA with Spanglish as an actual language, I figured I should have a go at it.By far, I'm not a professional movie critic, but I think I know a good film when I see one. I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 for its script, story and character development.I won't go into details about any of the three categories, but I will say this: bravo to Sandler for his go at something a little more serious, where he's not yelling at a golf ball or screaming at someone to be funny. I found his acting sentimentally humorous, and well-prepared. The chemistry between him and his two leading ladies were mysteriously absent, but that doesn't mean the character development was poor.If there was one OUTLANDISHLY bad aspect about this movie, it was that Tea Leloni's character had almost no redeeming character whatsoever. You really, REALLY dislike her and made absolutely no excuse for hating everything about her. I don't know if this was the actress' fault as much as it might be that combined with the director's lack of character endorsement. I don't know if the director WANTED the audience to like Leloni's character. Maybe his goal was to make her look as awful as possible.However, no character in a movie should be completely good or bad. Spells for a boring film.Watch it with a loved one, preferably your spouse and start a conversation about what kind of mistakes are the ones you can't make when you have children (as it was never discussed fully in the film).",Spanglish
202,drlawyer,More Hollywood preaching (though subtle),3,7 August 2005,"***WARNING*** This post contains spoilers about this film. If you haven't seen the film, don't see it, but feel free to read here anyway.Does anyone else get tired of Hollywood droning on and on about how horrible they think America is? If so, pass on this movie.The entire movie was one big ""America is filled with selfish materialistic half-wits - only the more noble cultures (like Mexico) have any merit"" cliché.The protagonist is a woman who starts off on the wrong foot with me - by sneaking into the U.S. illegally (of course, the movie glorifies this, because she resisted coming for as long as she could and finally succumbed to lowering herself to come to the U.S. so she could find a better life for her daughter... the martyrdom...).Once here, she is immediately put off by the garishness of the U.S. (which of course is represented by Los Angeles, which (IMHO) is the least American city in America). Fortunately, she is able to find a niche within the city where she is comfortable - a small segment of the city completely populated by other Latin Americans, who have created a little ""Neuvo Laredo"" right there in the city. No crime, of course - she is welcomed with open arms by the loving and giving community.Finally, she finds a job that allows her to support her daughter - as a housekeeper for Tea Leoni - who represents a caricatured version of the American woman. Selfish, insecure, obsessed with her looks and career, inconsiderate - she represents (in the writer's opinion and in that of the protagonist) all that is wrong with America in personam. Her husband is a sweet but hen-pecked chef (Adam Sandler) whose greatest quality is, apparently, that he has the emotional personality of a ""Latin woman"" - lacking in the machismo and confidence of Mexican men (of course).In the end, despite Leoni's desperate attempts to co-opt the heroine's daughter (since her own is a disappointing little fat kid), the heroine manages to protect her beloved culture in her daughter - by pulling her out of one of the finest prep schools in L.A., where Leoni was able to get her a full scholarship. The movie closes with the daughter writing a letter to Yale, warning them (somewhat pretentiously) that even if she's admitted, she won't change from the girl her mother wants her to be.A pitiable commentary that thinly veils the writer (and director's?) obvious disdain for all that is the United States, this move is more propaganda than entertainment. Pass on this one, even as a rental.",Spanglish

I mean, with such a cheap and stupid title, I nearly gave it a miss altogether, but while it exists in the rom-com universe, it doesn't go in for many of the tropes I normally associate with them. The dialogue and plot felt very genuine to me and I enjoyed the depth in the characters. Even Tea Leoni's Deborah, the most unlikable character, gave us plenty of reasons to like her, even as she simultaneously worked to undermine that. It's possible I'm giving it too much credit, but as the credits rolled I found I had a deep appreciation for it's ability to be light and funny and still deliver plenty of complexity in its characters and their relationships. There's a lot of understated beauty in this one and I'm honestly surprised it hasn't rated higher.",Spanglish

I, however, don't live in southern California and have seen this movie a number of times and enjoy more with each viewing. Paz Vega's performance alone is worth watching, but the help she gets from veteran Cloris Leachman, and newcomers Shelbie Bruce (her daughter, Cristina), and Sarah Steele as the plumb and plucky Bernice is memorable. The moments of pure perfection (the three-way translation conversation between John, Flor, and Cristina)compensate for the melodramatic story line and the uneven performances by Adam Sandler and Tia Leoni, two actors that certainly deserved a more subtle approach to their direction. Spanglish will stay will you longer after seeing it just once, and Paz Vega's ""Hollywood"" debut promises more fun to come. Bravo.",Spanglish
206,JLJH89,Oscar Hype Around this Movie Over-rated(Very Minor Spoiler),8,13 December 2004,"After reading in numerous magazines about the Oscar hopes for ""Spanglish"" I decided to go and see an advance showing of it to see what this hype was about. While it was an enjoyable and emotionally filled film, it didn't fulfill my, albeit, high expectations when it came to the directing and writing of the film. For an academy award winning and nominated writer, director, and producer, James Brooks sets high standards for his films. 1997's ""As Good as It Gets"", produced and directed by Brooks was the quintessential warm, fun comedy complete with round characters, solid writing, and, as one comes to expect from Jack Nicholson, strong acting. ""Spanglish"", while full of strong performances from Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni, did not have the benefit of talented writing. When the audience is introduced to Spanish speaking Flor (Paz Vega) we are introduced to a flat, simple minded individual simply because she could not express herself in English. Brooks did nothing to be creative and show her emotionally depth without her speaking. It is not until she eventually learns English are we treated to her emotionally depth as a human being as opposed to her Spanish speaking, stereotypical housemaid self. In this sense, Brooks missed out on hitting a home run in seeing things from a side opposite to what the majority of film goers are used to. This missed opportunity subtracted from the film as the Flor in the beginning is 180 degrees from that in the end. The one area in which the film triumphantly succeeded was in John Seale's cinematography. As one could expect from the cinematographer of Cold Mountain and Dead Poets Society, the dialogue cinematography was superior. Seale used Storaroesque style rack focus shots to keep coherence to the many dialogue scenes while also showing the isolation amongst the characters. Overall, this movie was a solid film which is enjoyable but does not live up to the buzz surrounding it as a result of lost opportunities in directing and writing. In my opinion, one's better off going to see Sideways for a much more human, deep, and funny film.",Spanglish

208,corinar,Span ... what?,2,25 December 2004,"This could have been an interesting movie, exploring the problems that arise from cultural contact, but that are relevant to any human relationship. Unfortunately, it failed and probably because it did not dare to go where it wanted to go. It had truly interesting moments that promised to explore the difficulty of connecting across language, cultures ... but more importantly ""all too human"" barriers. Instead it wrapped up it's story line exploiting every single cliché in the book: the ones about so-called ""Latin"" women, about ""Anglo"" males and ""Anglo"" females. That these stereotypical views persist is a tribute to the thickness of the human brain to even recognize a ""problem"". The ""Latin"" mother is portrayed as selfless, wanting what is ""natural"" -- that the daughter be like her mother. Was that any different from the portrayal of the neurotic ""Anglo"" mother that wanted her daughter to be more like her as well. And what to say about the ""whimp"" of the ""Anglo"" father who can see the problem, but does nothing to deal with it but be the sad little victim of these all powerful women. He is the ""good guy"" ... how trite can you get. I was however surprised by Adam Sandler's acting, he proves with this movie that he has it in him to be more than the ""moron"" he has played in the past. On the other hand the women were so over the top, and I am sure that they were asked to be over the top it was quite unbearable. Cloris Leachman was very good as well, but besides these two performances,there is little to recommend in this ""filled with stereotypes"" and cowardly film. Wish they had dared to go to some more interesting places ... or at least as far as recognized the difficulty of the mother-daughter relationship in any language, but more so when you have to do it in Spanglish.",Spanglish

Well, this movie contains the loves, parenthoods, cultures... It has made me changing my thoughts about my family.I'm not only just attracted by the storyline of the movie, i'm strongly attracted by Paz Vega's acting. She is such a great woman on this movie, who ""lives her life for her daughter"". And her Spanglish accent made me buy the DVD ""10 Item Or Less"" today, an other good one.And we can see many parenthoods on this movie, good parents, no-good parents... The responsibilities are all around the movie. The love between John and Flor is really romantic, comprehensive and passionate (in my eyes) but also really sad... Passing though the languages barriers, the people understand each other as well. And the love appears, also the fight...

210,tlander1,Sweet Mystery of Life,8,1 May 2005,"This beautifully written and superbly acted piece did not get the attention it deserved. Leoni was brilliant as the neurotic wife spilling her angst all over those she ""loved"". Vega was breathtaking and not just because she is exquisitely gorgeous. She used her body and her face and her eyes to communicate so much as she plays the woman who doesn't speak English. Steele portrays, to a tee, the wounded child who has already forgiven everyone. I was so moved by this young woman's ability to convey the generosity of heart that allows the character to be lovable, sympathetic, and believable. Sandler, Leachman and the rest gave delightful performances which held all together. I especially liked Sandler's interpretation of the conflict. He was human and he struggled, but he knew what was right for him and he did it. Bravo! The human spirit triumphs in the everyday struggles in this movie. Thanks. Thomas A. Landers",Spanglish

Spanglish is therapeutic in that is displays contemporary conflicts that surface between the average husband and wife, language conflicts between employers and service industry(Spanish and English), and culture differences between women(American and Mexican.)Although the emotional struggles are real and at times tragic, the director manages to surprise the audience with absurdities? or realities? (you decide)when you least expect it, which literally brings out guttural laughter. And if you watch alone, beware...you may find yourself deep in thought...examining your own intimate relationships with others...which I have no doubt...is the writers very intention.

212,MyRedCape,Should be Nominated for an Oscar!,10,24 January 2005,"Prelude: From the moment the trailer of Spanglish dashed across my eyes, I knew this was not going to be your typical Adam Sandler comedy. Could this movie even be considered a comedy? I didn't coin the phrase, but this movie is a ""Dramedy."" You won't find this word in a dictionary (Is this a word?), but you will find it in this review and that is all that really matters. So, not expecting a Happy Gilmore performance, my hopes were high. Very High! Synopsis: Mother and daughter travel from Mexico to the elite streets of Los Angels and meet an entertaining family who are shaped by the new culture presented to them by these two females. Adam Sandler and Tea Leoni star as husband and wife who hire Flor (don't forget to ruffle your r'sssss) Moreno as their housekeeper in an attempt to maintain order and sanity within their world. Sandler plays a 4-Star Chef and Leoni plays an insecure mother who runs and screams, ""Left, Left, Left""  Get the picture? Good.From the 7th Row: It is going to be hard for me to describe the theme of this movie  Mid-Life Crisis? No. A Doctor Phil Marriage Episode? No. How about  A Coming of Age Dramedy? YES! This story is told from a Princeton admission application written by a mature Christina Moreno. However, the Christina we see in the movie has yet to come of age. The story is wrapped around Christina and her Mother Flor Moreno's (played magically by newcomer Paz Vega  more later) journey from Mexico to the home of Chef John Clasky.What do you want to be when you grow up? Can anyone ever answer that question? As the song states, ""Some of the most interesting people I know still don't know what to do with their lives at 40."" How do we define ourselves? All these questions get the royal treatment in an enchanting film. In all honesty, I LOVE THIS FILM! However, I cannot seem to put my feelings into words at the moment. Thus, my faithful audience is in for a treat  Random Thoughts and Ramblings.Adam Sandler is as spunky as ever, especially in his scenes with Tea Leoni and Paz Vega. How can one actor display so much chemistry with two separate love interests? (Opps! Spoiler!) Cloris Leachman is absolutely hysterical as Tea Leoni's mother and what Sandler gives dramatically Leachman adds with comic relief. Anybody for a HUGE glass of wine at 11 o'clock in the morning? HA! Paz Vega in my opinion could be the next big thing. She has the beauty of Salma Hayek and ability of Catherine Zeta-Jones. Amazing performance  I can only hope the small screen does her performance justice.What is most important in life? I found myself asking that exact question after this movie. This film does a wonderful job of moving the audience to the conclusion that family may be the answer to this question. With all the drama and comedy that flashes before our eyes each day, it is nice to take a step back and remember what is most important. You never know how much you miss something until it is gone  Ladies and Gentlemen, on that note I will end this review. Sorry for getting really emotional, but sometimes that is what movies do.Upon Reflection: This movie may not be for everyone, but if you enter with an open mind  you won't be disappointed. Trust Me! Our relationship must be grounded in Trust; if we don't have that we have nothing. Whenever this movie hits the selves at the nearest Hollywood Video, I will be the first in line. However, don't wait until DVD, you need to see this movie while it is still in theaters. GOOD LUCK! If you haven't noticed by now, I tried to make this review a ""Dramedy.""",Spanglish
213,lplummer-2,I walked out of this horrid film,1,24 December 2004,"I can't begin to describe how terribly flawed this movie was. Call me a snobby elitist film critic... but I marched right the heck out of the cinema (leaving my mother and sister) about 3/4 of the way through. It was not something I could even sit through. The cinema lobby proved much less painful. Perhaps if the horrible acting on the parts of the adults and the vomit-inducing over-acting on the children's parts, I could perhaps have endured the dull, predictable, and thoroughly awful movie.The aspects of this movie that lent to its overwhelming unbelievability are just too numerous to mention. To touch upon specifics, Adam Sandler and the actress who portrayed his wife were so unbelievable as husband and wife. And the kids! Neither of them look a thing like their parents. In addition to this, the wife is more than a little crazy... The fact that Adam Sandler wants to help his wife looks more like stupidity than love! We are also to believe that an upper-class white woman who already has existing problems with her husband would suddenly invite a beautiful young Latina woman to live with them. Recipe for disaster, and yet she is insistent that she stays. Let's be real here people.What's with all the screaming? I can recall at least three instances in which someone lets out an ear-piercing scream from another room. What does this lend to making a good movie? It was annoying as hell at best.Then, of course, there's the matter of the on-the-spot translation. I happen to be fluent in both Spanish and English, and I found the translating scenes to be ridiculous, confusing, and deeply annoying. What purpose did they serve?! Yes, we know that the ""gringos"" didn't understand a word of Spanish. Yes, we know that Flor doesn't know English. Why throw it in our faces? It hurt my ears and my soul.So, ""Florrrrrr"" listens to a few ""English without Barriers"" cassette tapes and suddenly she is confident in her conversational Spanish, never seeming confused or asking anyone to repeat or slow down. Anyone who has studied a second language knows this is a joke.The plot was so weak, so poorly-developed, so painfully predictable. Nothing could have occurred in the last twenty-five minutes that would have surprised me in the least, or changed my opinion of this pitiful peace of cinema.I went to this movie knowing full well it would be Hollywood cheese attempting to glorify the lives of Mexican-Americans. What I didn't expect was a thoroughly painful experience that banks on all of our stereotypes of Latinos in this country. Perhaps I was just spoiled for having seen Almodovar's 'Bad Education' the night before, but I've never left a cinema... until today.",Spanglish

Rent Terms of Endearment, or Broadcast News and see what a talented writer and director is capable of creating. But that was then and this is now.What was particularly sad about this whole affair was that you could see where Brooks was swinging for the fences. This movie was chock-full of lines that probably looked good on the page, but clunked on screen. And Tea Leoni's over the top pas-ag wife was ridiculous. Everyone knows the woman has comedic chops, so it is clear that she was let down by a director who thought he was making Oscar magic.The fat kid was pathetic.

215,kellycpp,This is a treasure,9,4 June 2005,"A remarkable ensemble of performances by virtually the whole cast, delivering a rare movie jewel. I had no expectations and was completely blown away. This production lauds adults acting responsibly when their human tendencies might threaten other people's fragile wellbeing for relatively little gain. It wasn't that the affection between Flor and John wasn't genuine or portrayed with great care. It was what they chose to do when they desperately wanted to do otherwise. Character is forged when no one is looking. And these folks had character. I liked them.I have to say that I was astounded at the unexpected performance of Adam Sandler. When did he grow up? I want to be the man he portrays, both as family member and as an individual of integrity as he tries to maintain in the face of great immediate professional success. The obvious affection without judgment he had for his daughter was crafted exquisitely. But then he was counter-balanced perfectly by Paz Vega, as a person of integrity and hard nosed realism. And, I agree with Tea - gorgeous! Tea Leoni played the frantic neurotic to perfection; damaged and yet someone you could care about (at least I did). And I love everything Cloris Leachman does.

Negative reviews said it was ""uneven"", ""awkward"", and ""mean-spirited"".After I wright this I will look at those reviews to see what happens. Maybe it will confirm I know everything or nothing or somewhere in between. Please keep in mind one doesn't have to be a wordsmith to have something to say. That said I think this movie has the following going for it. Before we get into that though I just watched the trailer. One of the things that it had going against it (it lost money) was how it seems to have been marketed, but I think it is a good movie. Maybe If I actually do know something id will be a good source of cultural development one day. Kind of like the admiration towards Neil Armstrong or Niel Haggart for that matter. But anyway to me this movie portrays a cross section of society and touches on: Family values How to confront problems within the family dynamic Questions I think most parents ask of themselves That's all I can remember. I think its one of those worth watching again.Are awkward, uneven, and mean spirited feelings toward this movie correlated with beliefs that social inequality is inevitable?If it pleases and sparkles.",Spanglish

It also amazes me how someone can watch a well written movie and somehow not realize it. The stories this movie tells are life. The cheating wife and the husband who is being driven crazy but her ridiculous behavior. The parents who cannot agree on the proper way to raise their children. The good hearted person who has life happen to him instead of taking it by the horns. The mother who loves her daughter so much she lives her own life for her. She tries to protect her from everything including being spoiled and this changing her personality into something she doesn't approve of. The characters are well done and each serves their roles very well. The casting of Sandler was interesting but like others have said I was pleasantly surprised with his acting.

He's interested in spending time with characters and is not afraid of really long scenes. And Spanglish ought to be judged against his other work not other romantic comedies, because his work is usually quite superior. Even in his worst films, you are guaranteed of two hours of thought-provoking, sometimes beautiful moments, which he agonizes for years to craft. That said, sometimes he hits and sometimes he misses. It's hard to call Spanglish a miss because it has all these requisite Brooksian hallmarks. There's intelligent dialogue, there are honest characterizations and there are beautiful pictures usually coupled with memorable music. I would argue this movie has all the elements storywise to rate amongst his best, but a number of niggling details eventually bring it down from a classic such as Terms of Enderament or Broadcast News. First of all there is the casting. I don't have much bad to say about Adam Sandler's performance except that I just don't think he's a leading man. I think he would be a terrific supporting actor in a drama, but as a romantic lead he just doesn't nail it. Part of the problem is that he is trying so hard to suppress this goofy persona that he overdoes it with the nice guy. Not that there's anything wrong with nice guys, but nice guys who are romantic leads usually have some serious acting chops or they're obscenely handsome. I like Sandler's character here, it's just think his casting doesn't allow the picture to go to the next level, although I must admit Brooks is so smart he's written an explanation as to why Paz Vega's character would find this attractive  because her first husband was unable to express himself to her. The real problem in this picture is the kids. Very tough roles here, and it is obviously Mr. Brooks style to be generous with his actors, even though both the Bernice and Christina actresses were both newbies. I don't want to spend much time criticizing their noble efforts, I just want to point out that they come across less as real kids and more as just-so-super-happy-to-be-on-a-movie. Plenty of real choker moments here (the dangling feet scene in the restaurant is a classic) and much to recommend, but not his best effort",Spanglish
220,azkabanprisoner1970,Way better than what you would expect,7,16 April 2006,"Adam Sandler's name for me on the leading role did not really make me enthusiastic about watching that movie , but what a surprise!It is really good with a great storyline that is a bit predictable though, great acting specially from the actresses on board, Adam Sandler ? well I can think of a few names that could have been better cast for the leading role but anyway he was still OK, better than in any movie I have seen him in . 2 actresses were really superb, Sarah Steele the young girl who plays Sandler's daughter and the amazing Paz Vega in the leading role absolutely fascinating. The relationship between Vega and her daughter was so well written that you could believe it happening in real life. In short watch it and don't let Sandler's name drive you away",Spanglish
221,Edward Scissorhands,Amazing Film,10,9 April 2005,"You know I bought this movie without seeing it, only having read middle of the road reviews. Now let me say that I loved ""As Good As It Gets"" which is the main reason I went right ahead and bought ""Spanglish."" That being said, my initial reaction once the credits rolled was this, ""Wow."" It's a very deep movie that isn't superficial at all. You truly have to have a certain maturity level to honestly GET this movie and why it is so amazing. ""Spanglish"" is about real life, people, relationships, and their very real problems. There's no Hollywood happy ending, which I've never had a problem with, BUT this movie was so real. Adam Sandler and Paz Vega didn't run off together and live happily ever after, they both knew that they couldn't do what they believed they wanted because of the people they loved. With Sandler it's his wife and kids, with Paz it's her daughter. This movie is about the choices people make for the better fulfillment of their life and the ones around them. I really can't say enough about this movie, I stayed up till nearly 3am watching it. Definitely check out ""Spanglish"" and if you haven't seen it, ""As Good As It Gets.""",Spanglish
222,evieeive,Awful,1,3 July 2006,"This movie was surprisingly bad. There is nothing about this film that rings true. The entire movie is a series of vignettes strung together, but there is no heart from one scene to the next. None. Téa Leoni, who I normally find to be a believable actor, is so obviously acting (and over-acting at that) one can't help but think with every line she delivers she's lamenting how she got herself into such a mess. Adam Sandler is good as the wishy-washy hen-pecked soon-to-be-alcoholic husband to Leoni's overbearing wife, and Paz Vega as Flor Moreno seemed to be on the verge of showing her acting chops, but for a script that reins her in at every turn. Shelbie Bruce is credible as The Perfect Daughter to Flor. Ultimately, there are only two positives to this movie -two characters I cared about the performances of Chloris Lechman as Evelyn, the alcoholic mother to the seriously messed up Deborah (Leoni), and a very sweet, breakout performance by Sarah Steele, as Bernie, a daughter trying to overcome the fact that her mother would upgrade her with the 'Perfect, Thin, Smart Child' in a heartbeat if at all possible.

Perhaps the soundtrack does it's job, or the push-ins when the characters have their deep emotional revelations of the epitome of their personalities, but it's not what happens that makes me cry. It is the way the characters are relateable, not so much as the commonness of their ways, because they are very quirky almost to the extreme, but because there is a part of every person in each of them, or at least a part to strives to be. The language barrier just highlights the dialogue, as one watching tries to hear it from foreign ears and yet understands movements and emotions better than what is said. And that, I think, makes this movie perfect.",Spanglish

There's a scene where he and his wife are discussing their issues towards the end of the film in their bedroom. She's trying to tell him that she's slept with another man. Adam Sandler's reactions and adaptation to the givin circumstances of the scene were fantastic. His performance for me was heart wrenching.

226,slickswick,Too Much Is Lost In Translation,4,18 January 2009,"The story in this movie for the most part is solid, but the ending is so atrocious that it ruins the movie for me. The acting is solid and Sandler gives an above average performance. He manages to blend a solid mix of comedy, romance, and tragedy into a performance that shows he is capable of taking on more serious roles than what he has been pumping our his entire career. The beautiful Paz Vega is truly the saving grace in this movie by making it easy to watch while she's on screen. Paz delivers a committed performance and doesn't over emote or try to sell her performance. But the acting is not the problem in this movie at all. What could have be an above average movie that you watch some of on a random TV channel is ruined by an ending that takes the story back to a poor beginning and takes the attention away from the core of the story itself. What has been building throughout the whole movie seems to be cheapened and rushed at the end, even though it ends where it begins. I would recommend watching this movie and cutting it off before the last 5 or 10 minutes, and it might be more enjoyable that way.",Spanglish

It was too much of her in every scene, her reactions were unnaturally emotional and exaggerated, the lines sounded odd all the time. I don't know who she slept with to get the part of Flor in this movie. Several times i caught myself thinking: Flor's character couldn't say this! Flor has double standards!

This movie is one of my all-time favorites in a list of romantic movies. Paz Vega was amazing (and she's just gorgeous), and Adam Sandler shows that he has more range than he gets credit for. Adam does a fabulous job. He should do more movies that are not comedy - at least as an experiment. I don't think I'd be disappointed. He's funny in his silly movies, but this type of range would really give him a well deserved boost. It would change peoples opinion that he can only do silly comedies, which I enjoy BTW. His comedies are funny and I like them as well. However, this movie is special. If you like or love romance - watch this great movie. I enjoyed it very much.",Spanglish

A fine film with a couple bad moves. Not even bad so much as...well, just not perfect.The premise is golden: Brooks' trademark and forte or examining/displaying with poetry the plight of human existence/human relationships. The big and beautiful surprise here is Adam Sandler. I knew he had depth...I did not expect such depth. Such access to pain. Different, way different I think, than in Punch Drunk Love...this was real some how. This was beautiful and difficult to watch at times and beautiful.There is a tonne a bunch a fantastic amount of GREAT stuff in this film. Though I do admire Tea Leoni's commitment, there is something about her character choices that are just too BIG for this film. Next to Sandler's naturalistic, subtle, human, organic choices, Leoni looked often forced and unnatural and as if she were in a Americanized British farce.BUt truly truly...see this film.

I was hoping he would dump his wife. The movie ended with us not knowing where their marriage was going. Maybe that will lead to Spanglish 2? Paz Vega was brilliant and so was Cloris Leachman.Hats off to Shelbie Bruce too for her great acting and for putting on some weight just to make this movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone!! Tea Leoni was exceptional in this film as well and she made a very good psycho but, maybe went just a little bit too far in that role. Her character Deb Clasky felt terrible at the end of the movie about the way she treated her husband and for her affair but she never did show very much remorse for the way she treated her daughter or her mother for that matter. I was hoping at the end that John and Flor would get together and throughout the whole movie I thought it was leading there. I mean even the kids didn't care too much for their mother. I hope that Adam Sandler will make more movies like this. I still love just about every movie he has been in and he is a very funny man but he showed us can play a serious role as well.",Spanglish

Tea Leoni, as Deborah, is brilliant, playing her role with passion and zest as John's overtly neurotic wife! Flor (or ""floor,"" says Deborah) is played outstandingly by the gorgeous Paz Vega, one of THE most attractive actresses to come along in years! She is sensitive to the ""plight"" of her daughter Cristina, played brilliantly by Shelbie Bruce! And last, but surely not least, is Evelyn, the alcoholic mother of Deborah, whose dialog is simply brilliant: When, in a moment of tearful communication, Deborah asks of her mother, ""Do I need makeup,"" Evelyn responds, ""You need a hose dear!"" I just about fell off my seat!

Such is the case here with the American mother (Tea Leone) and and to a lesser degree her husband (Adam Sandler). Sandler is a chef who owns a restaurant that gets too high a rating. Poor baby! Leone is a mother who can't buy her way into her daughter's heart. Aw shucks! Despite this though, the movie is still an enjoyable one. Good performances from Sandler, Leone, Cloris Leachman as the grandmother, and especially Paz Vega playing the maid, make the interactions interesting to watch and the dialogue ring true.So, other than my lack of empathy and what I felt was a somewhat unresolved ending, the movie is still much better than most and I would recommend it.",Spanglish

The thought that kept going through my mind was ""Why would anybody spend 10 minutes with this shrew, much less get married and have a kid?"" Tea Leoni is a great actress, but her character was so completely self centered and one dimensional, even though Debbie's actions were the catalist for Flor's subsequent actions, there was simply no redeeming characteristics for her character, and that made John's decision to stay incomprehensible.

Not only did Sandler, Leoni and relatively new actress, Paz Vega turn in terrific, entertaining and moving performances, in watching the movie, you truly begin to believe them as their characters. It does as great a job as possible in a little over two hours of exploring the collision of two very different cultures. The comparisons are interesting, realistic (maybe slightly exaggerated, but as an Asian-American, some of the daughter's experiences brought up embarrassing, shameful experiences of my own) and almost uncomfortable to watch in a way.Tea Leoni does a pretty decent job in performing her role as a dysfunctional, extremely emotional wife/mother. The issues her character deals with in the film probably made many women feel uncomfortable because they are able or have been able to relate at one point in time. Either that, or they're afraid of becoming her. The one thing that kind of bothered me was I felt they made Bernice (the daughter) a little too sensitive at times (i.e. when she read her father's review out loud). Moments like that made certain scenes a little over-the-top. Other than that - a brilliantly executed film and one I would most certainly recommend.",Spanglish

236,jhvogelsang,When the sum of the parts outshine the whole Enchilada,8,7 June 2005,"James L. Brooks's newest addition to his Oscar triumvirate of 'Terms of Endearment', 'Broadcast News' and 'As Good As It Gets' is 'Spanglish', a romantic comedy targeted for a broader and more open - minded audience.Written with the emblematic twists of character, human frailties exposure and wit we have come to love, 'Spanglish' six main characters outshine - as individual performances the movie as a whole. But, they carry this film a considerable distance. They draw the viewer behind the facade and remote gated driveway of the attractive, contemporary and comfortable looking Bel Aire home where one sees not only an American dream fulfilled but a dream family that is living on a low calorie emotional diet.Adam Sandler, making a very tidy and interesting escape from his angry comedy persona is John Clasky, Master Chef and gentle, loving dad. His lovely but neurotic, narcissistic and driven wife, Deborah, is played with terrific physical and emotional commitment by Tea Leoni. She actually challenges us to not really like her at all - yet somehow manages to leave one with the impression that she bears no malice; it is just difficult to drive her much like all-the-bells-and-whistles Cadillac Esplanade she commands in the picture. Mild-mannered and sweetheart daughter Bernice, played convincingly by Philly native Sarah Steele defines what the term ""good kid"" really means. Also, as Deborah's mother Evelyn, the clever comedy veteran Cloris Leachman gets her share of deftly written laughs and more than everyone's share of liquor.Into this dreamy, seductive and fault-zone adjacent home with big pool marches the dazzling and solid immigrant mom turned nanny/housekeeper, Flor, played with remarkable emotive and expressive agility by the popular and talented Spanish actress, Paz Vega. Vega's Flor, guarded and hesitant, sustains her existence all for her daughter, Cristina, (Shelbie Bruce) who is equally dazzling and intelligent. When Flor is expected to join the Claskys in their incredible Malibu summer rental she reluctantly thrusts her once sheltered and carefully raised daughter into this wild California surf and turf.Showcasing the standout Vega, who learned English as the film was being shot, her lovely and charming Flor must learn English too. She communicates to the audience despite the lack of English subtitles to translate her Spanish; A clever and wise Brooks feature. Staying up late to finish language tapes she is seen in a new light: A stronger and more verbally adept employee that questions Deborah's motivations and a caring compatriot that soft dad Sandler can understand and bond with even if he is somewhat vague in managing his own family issues.Here is where this picture really takes off and then takes off again. Flor's determination to maintain her Mexican cultural continuity and raise Cristina with proper values is sorely confronted by Deborah's desire to covet and showcase the type of child she apparently wishes Bernice was. It is the departures from reality as we know it that may test some to really embrace this picture.But yet, socially challenged as it may be, Spanglish really pushes us to look beyond conventional wisdoms and ask the right questions: What is really important in the American Dream Home: Facades or family? And ultimately, that is what should matter in this picture as it pierced my heart and would not let go.",Spanglish
237,kitconn,I'll never forgive my girlfriend...,1,16 January 2007,"for dragging me to this estrogen-drowned disaster of a movie. Truly, this is one of the top three worst films I've ever seen. I am convinced that Adam Sandler must have been blackmailed somehow for him to appear in this dreck.Begin with the oh-so-heartwrenching story of a single mother forced to flee her native land in search of a better future for her daughter. Of course, the daughter will end up attending Princeton and her entrance essay is the premise of the storytelling in this movie. Shaking your head in bewilderment? It gets better (worse, actually).The dysfunctional family that the mother finds work with is possessed of a shrew of a father (the soft, unimposing and backbone-free Sandler) who is dominated by his overacting, speed freak-like, obsessive wife (Leoni), and round it out with a live-in, late-stage alcoholic mother-in-law (who of course, acts as a moral compass thanks to the wisdom gained by decades of squandering her life in a booze-soaked haze. Please!) and a few damaged, totally unbelievable kids. Viola, enough ammo for ""drama"" to make any menopausal woman salivate in anticipation of the impending deluge of emotional excess that comes with such movies.The problem is, there is not one scene in the movie where the characters earn your empathy. If there was ever a point where the viewer was meant to wonder what was going to happen next, or what course of action a character might take, I missed it. I believe it would be impossible to find a point in the movie that was not spelled out and spoon-fed to the viewer in the most plain and predictable terms.Another problem I have with this picture is the off-target promotion it received. It is not a comedy. I don't know what it is in terms of genre. Suicide-accelerant maybe? Since there are so many who love this movie, I'm sure that my review won't stop you if you want to see it.

Why one has to draw the distinction between what feels good and what is good?Spanglish is a good movie backed up by some great performances by Paz Vega and Adam Sandler.

I have to admit that I enjoyed Adam Sandlers efforts in Punch-Drunk-Love but honestly it couldn't compare to Tom Hanks in Philadephia or even new comer to drama Jamie Foxx in Ray. Spaniglish is another example of a comedian stretching himself so thin that the film just drags on like the dog tied to the bumper of Clark Griswald's stationwagon. I have walked out of few films that clearly were a joke but I never fell asleep through one as I did in Spanglish. Secondly, I think it casts a unfair demonizing steriotype on rich white Americans living in southern california while it glorifies the poor working class Mexican community with no practical merit. It is almost as if Hollywood has gone Mexican or at least the writer of this boring film is Mexican and has some delusion of Mexican - American pride and accomplishment. This picture will go the way of Ben and JLo's GILEE and hopefully Sandlers next film will lack his obvious guilt of wealth, being white, and popular which is common in the Jewish community.",Spanglish

However, this apprehension soon turned into gentle amusement as the film got under way. Sandler is actually watchable in this flick; for the first time ever, I didn't want to jump out of my seat and punch him until he stopped. His performance was convincing and genuinely surprising. The film itself suffers from Leoni's voice, which reminded too much of metal being scratched. It is also too lingering on the sentimentality and could've done with being a few minutes shorter. It's too lightweight to really get to grips with the issues of race and class that it raises, but then it is more about relationships. Other than this, it was quite funny in places; with Leachman's 'old woman' performance being a highlight. Paz Vega looks great and carries off her 'Florrrr' with aplomb...

For me, more time could have been spent establishing the foundations of the mother, daughter relationship between Flor and Cristina before moving on.Whilst watching the film I did keep thinking to myself what the film would have turned out like if a Spanish director had got hold of the story. Watch this space.Having said that, it could really only be set in America to be able to explore the relationship between a soul like Flor Moreno coming up against the hedonistic Deborah Clasky and make it believable.It was interesting to discover James L. Brooks take on the husband, John Clasky, and the references to having emotions about the family earthquake that was going on around him, but without the ability to express these emotions. In some way's this failure in John prevented him from doing anything about what was going on in his live and left us with the slightly empty ending. Maybe just leaving the door open for the sequel.Paz Vega was the leading light and gave a strong performance throughout, sometimes in the face of rather lightweight performances around her. The story line should strike a chord with a great number of fathers/husbands out there.I would really like to see what Pedro Almodovar, Agustin Diaz Yanes or Alejandro Amenabar would make of this.",Spanglish
249,dvesella,It's not about him,8,30 November 2005,"It was both interesting and a little bit weird to see Adam Sandler in a serious role. The entire time I was watching the movie, I was expecting him to be funny, but he never was. He was just a sweet, good, honest man in a frustrating situation. On a similar note, it was also interesting to see Tea Leoni be crazy. But the movie wasn't about her, and it wasn't about him. I believe this may be the first Adam Sandler movie where he is not a main character. The movie is about Paz. It's not even about Sandler AND Paz. It's just about her. The adorable woman draws your empathy as she tries to keep her daughter sweet and innocent despite outside influences. Her spirited performance as a dutiful mother who lives for her daughter is touching. As a mother of a daughter myself, I hope I can do the same.Don't watch this movie expecting it to be funny. It is loving, and touching, and special.",Spanglish
250,sleepyinnyc,Lovely,10,20 December 2004,"I must confess that I rolled my eyes when I saw the trailer for Spanglish. I thought - great, yet another picture where the Latin girl is an uneducated maid or nanny. But after reading several positive reviews I was curious enough to see it and I'm very glad I did.This is a warm and lovely movie. The characters played by Paz Vega and Adam Sandler are good, well-meaning people who are trying to do their best, for themselves and their children, and who find an unexpected connection despite their different backgrounds and even an initial language barrier. There is nothing stereotypical here and even though I've never been an Adam Sandler fan, I have to say he's great here.Everything and everyone in this movie feels real, but I guess that's not surprising considering it was directed by James L. Brooks, who gave us Terms of Endearment and As Good As It Gets. I can't wait to see his next movie!",Spanglish
251,cerealboy,Absolutely Excellent!!!,10,29 December 2004,"I very much enjoyed the overlying theme of this movie that life can be so much happier if you just be yourself, and also to just be upfront with how you feel, what you believe, and who you are. This movie got me choked up at a few parts and also had me laughing. All the characters were brilliant! Sandler seemed to play a role similar to his own personality and gave many subtle remarks during the film that are so true and that I have only been waiting for someone to say publicly. The entire scene where Flor apologizes to John for being hypocritical and just takes what he says as truth is just amazing to me, as well as a major turning point in the story line where they both begin to notice more of who they are and a connection that has been established between them. I believe it takes someone else to really know your own self, and this movie really showed that in many ways.",Spanglish
252,neopisteme,Universal depiction of immigration and a vast range of human emotions,10,8 April 2005,"The movie reflects upon the life of millions of people in the world leaving their home land for one reason or another. It is just too general to be believed to be on Mexican immigrants only, and that is the strong point for me.Since human beings are unique in their actions, it would do injustice to the movie to ask why the characters reacted as they did. I saw it as a very plausible and possible scenario and very interesting one too.The movie goes beyond immigrants and their problems, it deeply touches the human factors like love, self loving, self doubting, love of children, feeling of rejection, need for approval, regret, and ...This is why I have given it a perfect 10, showing us so much and yet not superficial.The only thing I had hard time to feel realistic about was Deborah's daughter's reaction to the newcomer and how Deborah treated her and always talked about her beauty! If I were a girl, I would have been absolutely jealous about it but again, there might be a few out there to react such.",Spanglish

The trailer had warned me a bit that I wasn't going to see Sandler wielding a golf club or sprouting horns, but nonetheless, my obsession with all things Adam lured me in. I was disappointed by the fact that Sandler wasn't the lead role(Sandler was probably one of 4 protagonists). The rest of the cast is predominantly female, and this gives an indication of the film's feel. It's a bit like sticking Sandler in the middle of Steel Magnolias or Mystic Pizza. I was disappointed by that, but pleasantly surprised by the flow and feel of the movie. A bit cheesy in parts, but for those of us that like a bit of cheese, it often leaves a warm glow inside. There's enough of Sandler to please his fans, and even a couple of SHOUTING moments, even if he does apologise after one of them!! It's a nice film, it's a bit long, if you like Sandler, women, or Mexicans, you should probably see it.",Spanglish

There were several funny parts of the movie, but it leaned towards a serious tone. This time Adam Sandler portrays a father and a husband with a troubled marriage.This is the first time that Adam Sandler's versatility as an actor has been greatly tested. He passed with flying colors.In this movie one can see the different faces of Adam Sandler's character, john Clasky. He is at many times a great father as shown with his daughter Bernice, played by the very talented Ms. Sarah Steele. He is also shown as a passionate chef with the restaurant that he owned. There were also flashes of a husband trying to save his marriage.he acting was brilliant in this movie.

When I was younger I would say ""eh, I hate Adam Sandler He can't act, and he is NOT funny"" after watching ""punch drunk love"" I found he was A very talented actor, but still lacked focus to be considered ""funny"" by my standards. Now when I started to watch Spanglish I realized that Adamn would be In the midst of great acting, But from the moment he stepped on the screen to the very last scene of this movie I was impressed not only by how well he was cast but by how many times I laughed at him in this great film. Not only would I recommend this movie to everyone, But Adam has made it so I can no longer say ""Adam Sandler is not funny"" He proved me Dead Wrong on that fact and I thank him for doing so. To Adam Sandler Himself, I hope very much to see more great films, of this caliber, with you in them.",Spanglish

You will find it alternately touching, amusing, annoying, frustrating, sad, disappointing, surprising (at times STARTLING is the word for the Tea Leoni character). The key to whether all these add up to a well-integrated dose of life (which is also entertainment), is whether it all works. And with JLB, as with the best of Woody Allen, it does. If something seems not to fit, you just haven't caught on yet. It's the kind of movie one learns from; the kind worth watching again. Put all that in the format of a FAMILY film, and it's pretty amazing. In my family, everyone from 13 to 66 thought it was ""great"". Watch it, closely, all the way through.",Spanglish
258,rextremende,This One Hits For Sandler,8,12 November 2005,"Since Adam Sandler left SNL, his movies for me have been definitely hit or miss, which I suppose makes for some anticipatory movie watching: one can never get comfortable with any sort of expectation.This movie surprised me, however, and in part because Sandler was not such a focal point of the movie. This is not to demean Mr. Sandler but to show that, yes, he CAN get out of the way when need be, which is the hallmark of a true professional. I was pleased with his character and how well he handled it. Over-the-top he is not, at least here. His was a character, not a caricature.What I found refreshing was the way infidelity was dealt with. Without spoiling it for those who have yet to see it, the humanity of temptation was presented realistically.Cloris Leachman was Cloris Leachman, and that is ALWAYS a good thing. Tia Leoni's character, while pathetic and borderline despicable, nevertheless evoked some modicum of sympathy. The child actors did well.I thoroughly appreciated the lack of subtitles for the Spanish dialogue. This drew me to watch the actors more intently (as if one needs a reason to NOT watch Paz Vega intently) which in turn allowed for the acting to tell the story. Very well done.Some glitches in continuity, but forgivable.Comedy? From the pure definition, as in comedy v. tragedy, yes. Funny? In parts, but not central to the film. Romantic? Very, though I could have done without the Sandler-Leoni sex scene. Will I include it in my library? You betcha.",Spanglish

Characters in this film each have their own interesting back-story (or suggestion of one) which helps each of them seem so real. The dynamics of the relationships examined are interesting but don't come across as contrived, which is even better. You will find moments to laugh, but unlike previous Sandler flicks these moments are not limited to slapstick or sleaze - they are genuinely amusing insights into human interactions and quirks. Paz Vega is lovely and brings us the character of Flor Moreno in such a way that it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. I hadn't seen her before and it turns out most of her previous work was Spanish. Cloris Leachman gives us a character that we all want to meet.",Spanglish

I think it teaches the lesson to may that no matter what you think you can do you can do anything if you just try. The reason I say this is because the hispanic maid managed to make a living even not being able to speak English. One of the main reasons that the little girl was able to get over what her mother had done to her was because of the maid who learned how to say just try it on. The little girl thought that she may have actually been able to fit into the clothes, it was all because the Maid who people probably said wouldn't be anything. Many times throughout the movie the mother would put her daughter down and she wanted to take the hispanic woman's daughter everywhere with her instead of taking her own daughter with her",Spanglish

If I had to rate this film i would give it a 8. It had a lot of situations that happens in real life.. like when his wife don't satisfy him in bed, how the daughter is self conscience about her weight, and they treat and talk to individuals who cant speak English(like they're retarded) i have seen this movie a great number of times and every time i see it i find something new. its full of surprises and excitement.",Spanglish

Flora, the emigrate, and her daughter, Christina, comes from Mexico to America to work for this ""wealthy"" family.

I liked how it showed that you don't have to turn your back to people just because they are from a different culture. The actors really brought the life to the movie. It was just right with a little bit of comedy and drama as well. The movie really showed how to not take people for granite when they don't know how to speak a certain language as you do. The actors were excellent. Adam Sandler and the daughter of the maid were my favorite actors. The little girl was very funny when she had to translate most of the time for her mother. My favorite part in the whole movie was when they rented the beach house. The little girl picked out all that sand glass and Adam Sandler had to pay her all that money. I have found sand glass and it is really neat how the lightning and sand can make that. This movie will become one of many movies on my favorite list.,Spanglish

The scene with the orgasm was so bad I almost suffered convulsions. Adam Sandler was surprisingly the least repulsive member of the cast (How many times has that happened?).

Adam Sandler, in a stark departure from his ""goofball"" roles, is effective, even engaging as a harried father in this film. But the film is really about the five amazing women involved in this story (when's the last time you could say THAT about a movie?).The women are all outstanding, especially Paz Vega and Tea Leoni.Sandler's character's tender relationship with his teenage daughter is so well scripted and delivered to the screen! The girl that plays his daughter (Sarah Steele, as Bernice) is my latest addition to the ""Where in the World Do They Find These Kids?"" list.Vega's daughter is adorable (Victoria Luna, as Christina), and Cloris Leachman has been a favorite of mine since Bogdonovich's ""The Last Picture Show"".""Spanglish"" is a gem -- every time I think back on it, I like it more.

The movie lasts for over TWO HOURS, largely composed of just watching a pretty woman pretend to not know how to speak English. I was totally bored waiting for it to just *freaking* end already. The characters were likable, though I found the Cristina-heavy scenes annoying (her crying fits & impassioned translation services).

Also, Paz Vega is simply breathtaking. Comparing her to Penelope cruz is a travesty..Paz is infinitely more beautiful, forceful and intense. The supporting cast led by Tea Leoni also does a wonderful job. see this without expectation of fireworks and you will be pleasantly surprised at the delicate artistry in how the characters are developed and interact. a fine example of movie making. a Lovely movie for anyone who can imagine a fresh immigrant's troubles in integrating into the American way of life while still trying to maintain their identity.",Spanglish

And Spanish speaking people don't run around speaking loud Spanish to people they know don't understand them. Mr. Brooks has made some fine films that are both charming, funny, and moving, this is not one of them.

There were a lot of loose strings that weren't tied up; conflicts that had no use of being there, mainly because it had nothing to do with the movie and because they never tied up those loose strings! I don't even think that I will have time to pin point all of the horrible things in this movie but I must say this. Who would've imagined the father and Flor getting together. It seemed stupid because I have never seen chemistry between them before and then all of a sudden there she is sitting making out on a couch in a restaurant suddenly attracted to a man twice her age while another strange turn out of the 'depressed mother' just confessed that she was having an affair....it seems as though the writer of this movie started writing from the beginning without really knowing what he wanted to happen in the end so he just quickly wrapped it up.

The sex scene was just stupid, the ""revenge"" thing was even more stupid. Totally not at all what I expected and especially not what I thought my husband would like.

I have Spanglish on DVD and have watched it a million times. For me it is relevant because I work with international development and people often think that those who do not have as much stuff are not as well off as we are in the US suburbia. What this movie shows in a really neat way is that we should reassess that statement of the fact that we are somehow 'better' or 'superior' and try to really understand the strength of character and general strength of people who have come from tough situations and have made it through. It is heart warming, and focuses on what it means to be 'family' It also touches on the concept of immigration. Within that topic it focuses on which way of life is 'better' and how you can live someplace but not be really 'living' there and how the people you surround yourself with are the people you become. I think it touches on really interesting issues and really makes you think. It also has some good old fashioned comedy and romance. I think it is fantastic.

I know i would eat his stuff, if you know what i'm saying. Not only were the American actors/actresses amazing in this movie, but the Spanglish ones were as well. While watching this film I actually cried. NOt just a few tears, but full out bawling. I actually paused the movie, cried for a few minutes, then resumed watching. this movie will teach you the importance of family and pride in your heritage. After watching this film, I immediately called my mother, father, and boyfriend to remind them just how much I cherished them being in my life. If you enjoy a realistic and multi-lingual representation of the human life then you will most definitely enjoy this masterpiece.

I suppose the answer was that after seeing so many Adam Sandler movies I thought I knew what to expect. That slapstick humour and same character/plot development present in most Sandler movies. This wasn't the case. Whilst you do find yourself sympathising with Sandler throughout this movie, the main focus is on Flor and her daughter Cristina. The acting from Paz Vega, who plays Flor and Shelbie Bruce, who plays her daughter Cristina is top notch. They absolutely steal this movie with terrific performances from both. Spanglish is full of great humour, engrossing drama and has a great story with a valuable lesson behind it. A definite must see.",Spanglish

Who KNew!?,10,5 January 2005,"I saw this movie today and was so surprised by how good it was until I had to check with motherdear (that's what I call IMDb) and find out what others thought. Well-- I decided that I would just write my comments without checking what others thought. This--is--a--GOOD movie. The storyline is simple, yet complex (to keep it interesting) with all the little nuances that happen in families between family members friends and even the darn PETS!! and just everyday stuff that we as humanstrip on. I confess that I went to see something else, but the timing was off so I saw this Spanglish by default- didn't want to see it because that guy Adam Sandler was in it so I figured it would be goofy. Wrong. My bad, Adam, I really LIKED you as daddy - I've ALWAYS loved Cloris Leachman (from MTM show) she's really underrated and did not disappoint me as Tea's mother. Tea Leoni's role as the mother was awesome!!! I didn't know the girl could act like that! (this might be your year Tea if you're reading this) I loved Adam's and Tea's, daughter in the movie-- I think her name was Bernie. She - is- so- lovable and adorable!! I loved Christina, too, the housekeeper's daughter(she also deserves a supporting nomination) I can't tell you for what scenes. You have to SEE the movie). I think this movie is also good because it had the look, flavor and sound of a foreign film, but WITHOUT subtitles. Very--clever,-- Mr. Brooks; using a beautiful woman speaking a fiery language with such passion that sounded so good! until you didn't even care WHAT she was she saying. The conversations and lines between the key characters were poetry. People will be stealing lines from this movie like they used to back in the day when movies were movies (I've already memorized a couple. Normally, I can remember the music, but I don't know if it was so subtle until I can't remember or it was such a major character until it blended in with the storyline. Maybe it was a character, too.

It did have it's funny moments, touching moments (I'm a softie), and insightful moments.But they were too few and far between. For a film about communication barriers, be it linguistic or family-oriented, it never developed ANY plot line fully, and yet the film is all talk and feels long. Adam sandler is fine. I was still bothered by the inclusion of a few typical ""Sandler-ish"" outbursts that just didn't work. Tea Leoni, whom I usually really like is totally one-note, and off base.her character is so unbearably unbelievable that she doesn't even work on a fun, bitchy, campy level. Cloris Leachman is funny and solid, but hardly warrants award consideration. There are almost totally wasted sublots involving the kids in the film, despite lengthy set ups. Only Paz Vega and the girl playing her daughter (sorry for not having her name handy) shine in the film. Their work, be it alone, together and opposite the rest of the cast is the only thing that kept me from drowning in my own growns and searching for a drink or a firearm. ""Spanglish"" is wholly disappointing. It tries too hard to cover all the bases without resolving much, if anything, and runs on and on...A total lack of connection.",Spanglish
284,ucla-usc,Superior and well-nuanced film,8,8 April 2005,"Thought the characters and the story were superb and topical. Strongest were Paz Vega, Cloris Leachman, and the girl who played Vega's daughter. The girl who played Sandler and Leoni's daughter was also great. Sandler was kind of flat, playing himself, as usual. Leoni was good, but not up to her best work.Great issues about humanity. Less great about the cultural stuff (lots of platitudes, little that was concrete.) Decent depiction of West L.A. liberal culture. Those of us who live there, saw it skewered pretty accurately.Happened to have seen ""Closer"" and ""Sideways"" the past week, before this one. In terms of good entertainment, great characters, strong message, ""Spanglish"" is way better than the others, and THEY got Oscars and Oscar nominations. This reviewer's opinion, anyway.",Spanglish
285,osulldf,Heartwarming,8,14 August 2005,"This is a classic root for the underdog movie.The big difference is that the goal promoted is not material or sexual satisfaction, but the fulfillment of one's responsibilities.I found it heartwarming. At times the dialog was difficult to follow, not only due to the Spanish accents and the like, but the seeming inability, though genuine appearing, of the characters to articulate their thoughts and feelings.I really do not understand why this movie is rated PG-13, I can't see any reason it would not be shown uncut on TV, and in fact it would be a great movie for sharing with preteens to mold them using some of universally respected morality it promotes. Some real ""family values"".",Spanglish
286,Gr8GolferWB,Well balanced look into a melting pot of cultures.,7,24 December 2004,"Spanglish features Adam Sandler (John Clasky) in his most serious role to date. His movies have tended towards a more serious role of late, with 50 First Dates having more storyline and character development than any character of his since Happy Gilmore. In Spanglish the role of the mother (Flor Moreno, played by Paz Vega) is easy for anyone who knows English as a second language to relate to. For someone who is fluent in English and Spanish, it was fun to hear the translations going back and forth as well as the progression of the mother as she struggled to find the words for her emotions. I thought the movie was well balanced and showed multiple sides to all of the situations. I found the ending to be a little weak, but the overall quality was high. Spanglish: 7/10",Spanglish
287,catattack77,"A wonderful, quiet film with outstanding performances",8,10 January 2005,"I had no idea when I walked into Spanglish that I'd be affected emotionally by this wonderful-but-odd (and certainly non stereotypical) tale of a Mexican woman and her daughter who collide with an upper-class yet dysfunctional American family. The performances are absolutely incredible, including what should be an award-winning performance from almost-forgotten Cloris Leachman, as well as Tea Leoni in her finest performance yet. But every performance is top-notch, including a restrained Adam Sandler in his most watchable film.James L. Brooks' subtle yet powerful script is full of little moments. Many of these moments are drop-dead funny, such as the insistence by Tea Leoni's character not to play fetch with the dog. As someone with a new puppy, I absolutely knew what the problem would be...and, sure enough! What a wonderful, albeit small, moment in this film full of small and wonderful moments.",Spanglish
288,transhero,crap!,1,31 January 2005,"This movie was God-awful! Thank heavens that I got the free ticket to see it. Adam Sandler was good in a non-comedic role, but I thought this was going to be a comedy, not a chick-flick. And the plot resolution at the end? Waiting for Godot was better than that. If you want to see it, basing it off of Adam Sandler's past performances in The Wedding Singer, Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Waterboy, Mr. Deeds, Big Daddy, or Anger Management, then don't. This is not a movie where he plays a moron who ends up getting a happy life in the end. He already has a good wife, and then it goes to the pits because his wife is a whore. I'll give it something: the acting was good, and there were some funny moments (about 2), but that (and having Cloris Leachman, AKA Frau Blucher (neight!) as the alcoholic grandmother, who is the funny of this movie) is it! You'll save yourself time and money if you go and see something like Meet the Fockers.",Spanglish
289,ccollins80,Very Impressed,8,13 August 2005,"I didn't watch this movie for a long time because I didn't like the way it was marketed. It looked like it was going to be a chick flick! I wasn't entirely wrong but the rest of the package really made up for that.James L. Brooks doesn't know how to write a bad script. What an incredible legacy as a comedic writer. How does someone who knows everything about comedy know so much about drama? I was surprised to see Sandler in this role. This movie proved to me that Sandler is a far more dynamic actor than anyone knew.Paz Vega; what can I say about Paz Vega what a wonderful new actress. It's not very often we get to see a ""New Actress"" that just so happens to be a 6 year veteran with thirteen productions under her belt. The entire cast was spectacular with the exception of the boy Ian Hyland who wasn't really written into the script so we weren't able to see his acting ability.",Spanglish
290,Dkjones0508,Terrific Movie,9,29 March 2013,"James L Brooks is one of the finest writer/directors in film. His movies contain well crafted scripts with complex characters and multiple story lines that intertwine to tell an entertaining story. As Good As It Gets was a true masterpiece. While this film doesn't quite reach those heights, it is still quite entertaining. The movie primarily centers around Cristina Moreno and her mother Flor's experiences with the Clasky's. The Clasky's are a well to do family in contrast to the equally poor Moreno's. You can read a synopsis of the plot for more detail which provides a good account of the story lines involved.Adam Sandler is known for his screwball comedies that are primarily written by him. When Sandler steps outside that genre it turns out he isn't a bad actor at all. Sandler does a fine job portraying John Clasky, a recently well regarded chef who is happy with his balance in life and reluctant for that to change. While he doesn't wish to embrace it he seems able to deal with any obstacle that comes his way. If you hate Adam Sandler this probably won't change your mind but if you'd like to see what he can do with a well written script he does a very good job playing this part. Sandler has come a long way since his days at SNL. However, much like the character in this film, seems intent on staying close to his screwball roots. Sandler's goofy charm serves him well and it is refreshing to seem him play a part with an IQ over 100.Paz Vega is a delight as Flor Moreno, a poor but very gorgeous Mexican housekeeper. While poor, Flor is also very reluctant to change her life or that of her daughter. Much like Clasky she seems reluctant to change and chooses to live within her comfort zone. She is fiercely protective of her daughter and that helps form a very likable character that thankfully is a big part of the movie.Leoni plays her part well as Deborah Clasky, the narcissistic, extremely (intentionally) unlikable wife of John Clasky. Leoni was well cast in this part because after all who really likes her anyway? However, her character is vital to the overall tone, plot and sub-plots found in this movie. She consistently challenges John Clasky to deal with her and the repercussions of her destructive actions. Especially her treatment of her own daughter and of Flor's daughter Cristina.Leachman is really a gem in this movie. She is a great actress and is so good in her supporting role it's no wonder she was nominated for a SAG award for best supporting actress. Leachman definitely does not disappoint in her role as mediator of the messes that come the character's way. Along with her ""wisdom"" comes a few very funny ""airhead"" moments along the way that lend to her characters complexity. The very brief shot of her ""learning"" English with Flor is by far my favorite.The girls in this movie, Cristina and the Clasky's daughter ""Bernie"", while forgettable for their acting, were really the catalyst to the entire film. The interactions between them, their own parents, and each others parents were well done. You genuinely felt sorry for Bernie and John Clasky as well as the angst felt by Flor all in dealing with the actions of Deborah.If you are watching this because you like Adam Sandler and you expect to laugh out loud then don't bother, this movie is way too high brow for you if that is the case. However, if you are a fan of good writing and a good drama/comedy you can't do much better. I've only given 9 out of 10 for this movie because it was not on par with As Good As It Gets (10 out of 10 every day of the week). It is a tough comparison when you look at the cast of the two films. I honestly don't know who else should have played the part of John Clasky but the existence of Sandler is the only reason I can think it was not more highly regarded. There are a handful of movies that I'll watch every time I see that they're on. This has become one of them.",Spanglish
291,Carlos-160,"Well worth seeing, way beyond a dumb-funny movie",10,20 December 2004,"I was very surprised by this movie. Amidst the well written comedy scenes, there are many LIFE-IMPACTING conversations. If you pay attention to this movie, I think you will learn something about yourself, about cultural differences, about Responsibility....All while having a good time and a few laughs. Go see it. I think Paz Vega is a stand-out in her first big Hollywood appearance. Adam Sandler is good, and he certainly could deliver more emotion. Mrs. Leoni overacts and becomes quite bothersome (which I think IS the point!). There is something for everyone here. The daughter does a super-fine acting job, and she is clearly headed into bigger roles. She delivers some subtle scenes of conflicting emotions. Go see it !!",Spanglish
292,theprude,Very well cast!,8,29 December 2004,"The entire cast did an excellent job, both on an individual and ensemble level.Tea Leoni plays the role of a high-strung, morally-ambiguous, depressed mother perfectly. It's total gray-area, and you really want to hate her except for the fact that she seems so earnest.Cloris Leachman's comic timing was great! (I love Ann Bancroft, but I couldn't see her doing a better job). The part where Evelyn is learning English with Flor is so endearing.Sandler and Paz Vega both shine and you feel that there is a genuine connection and understanding, despite the language barrier. The kids (the two daughters) are great and completely natural in their respective roles. Sarah Steele does an especially convincing job as the emotionally-resilient Bernice. Her connection with Flor is very moving, especially after Flor adjusts Bernice's new clothes so they are no longer ""size 8"". This was a very unique movie, and for me, the two hours flew by. My only complaint would be that it should not have been compressed into the standard two hour format at the expense of unexplored plot development.",Spanglish
293,mom-61,Loved this movie,10,17 December 2004,"Spanglish was entertaining, insightful, and a positive message movie in today's mixed up world. Adam Sandler's performance was very well acted and heartfelt. Cloris Leachman's performance as the grandmother was hilarious and dead on! Tea Leoni reminded me of my Aunt Betsy! Paz Vega gave an amazing and very believable performance as Flor. All in all, this movie deals with very real issues in a responsible manner and reflects the Latino culture very positively. What I found interesting is this movie did not use subtitles, but you didn't need them to get the point across. And the scene when the daughter acted out/translated directly for the mother was priceless. I thought this movie was the best movie I've seen in a long time! Actors were perfectly selected and plot keeps you engaged.",Spanglish
294,deepthinker50,Great Movie!,9,20 December 2004,"This movie was very good. I thought Adam Sandler was fabulous and it showed his ability as an actor. The pain the family was going through was definitely brought out in the film. When a film like this is released, a lot of people expect the actors in it to not do well. I thought that Adam Sandler really connected with the children, especially with the daughter, in this film. He has a good grasp on what it is like to be a parent, how to love children unconditionally. The tension between John (Adam) and Flor (Paz) is believable. They care so deeply for each other, yet they both understand what is at stake. Yet Deb (Tea) insecurities are believable when she has an affair. I thought the direction of the movie was great as well.",Spanglish
295,wilcofan,Wonderful funny movie,10,17 December 2004,"Adam Sandler once again proves he so much more than just a goof ball, he is a comic genius. This is a wonderful heartfelt movie. Paz Vega absolutely steals the show. Anyone who has been through a rough spot in a marriage will really connect with the story. This is a great depiction about priorities and family. Through trials in life, on so many levels, we learn who we really are and what really matters to us. This is a movie that everyone can enjoy. I know some soccer moms who are just like Tia Lenoi's character. Wow, the way the world turns. Watch this movie, you will love it. This has got to be one of the best movies of the year!

296,rums0007,A Save for Adam Sandler,8,18 December 2004,"Adam Sandler shows his ability to make us laugh with his talent rather than just his immature rambling and voice tones. I was impressed about how he took a rather serious character and blended in his humor and softer side. If you are not a Sandler fan, his ranting and immature antics are pretty much absent in this movie. Tea Leoni's performance, was overall boring and does not deserve the credit she's been given. Her competitive attitude is overdone. Guys, you will be able to stomach it. Do not expect full out comedy, but rather a little bit of drama but an overall feel good movie. This movie may not be an Oscar, but it was definitely worth the trip.",Spanglish
297,silverman-2,Best movie I've seen in years,10,18 December 2004,"This movie has some of the best character development I have seen. The comedic elements are brilliant situational comedy, especially by Cloris Leachman's role of the grandmother. Sandler is also funny, but in situational humor that makes his character real. This is not a typical slapstick comedy role for him, and his ability to listen to all the women in his life & understand them is to be envied. His character is the best listener in a movie since Helen Hunt's role in As Good As It Gets. This vaults into my personal Top 5 movies ever (along with Casablanca, Braveheart, Good Will Hunting, and the Shawshank Redemption...in case you wanted some comparison). I will go see this movie again within the next week.",Spanglish
298,mark-berti,great cast,8,24 December 2004,"This film exposes the range of abilities the cast has, and Sandler, Leoni, Vega and Leachman each deserve Oscar nominations, though they will likely not get them. Sandler couldn't have hit the mark better including all the slapstick stuff he's done before, Tea's energy and raw presence are astounding, Paz' performance immediately places her near superstar look-alike Penelope Cruz, and Cloris Leachman's supporting role performance must be among her best. The story is refreshing as it honestly teaches lessons, usually the same one, to both yupsters and hard-working immigrant classes, that heart, soul and mind do matter and trump overt beauty, consumption and other meaningless superficialities. Parenting is a life-long challenge, and anyone who has children or is thinking about having them should see this movie. The story set within a narrative frame is a nice touch, too.",Spanglish

I think I own all of his movies was surprised he could do serious so well. Great movie, Go, Go, Go! I thought it was going to be a chick flick, but my husband who's favorite all time movie is Predator, told our son he should take his wife and go, it had heart and soul! My favorite way that a girlfriend and I like to describe a good movies is: I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me! Best movie of that caliber I have seen in a very long time!",Spanglish
300,debcarlos,Disappointing,6,29 December 2004,"I saw this movie with high expectations. However, I left the theater disappointed by the unbelievable characters and all-over-the-place story line. Although the message of the movie was good, the movie lacked smooth transitions between scenes, which interfered with the purpose of the film - the concept of family is understood by people from different cultural backgrounds.As a side note, Adam Sandler's entry into a dramatic role is admirable. He played a lovable character whose devotion to his wife and kids is touching. In addition, Tea Leoni's interpretation of a neurotic perfectionist gets two thumbs up.",Spanglish
301,srbraithwaite,Support the principle,7,29 December 2004,"My reactions sometimes amazes me when I go to a movie that I really want to like. This film had all the key ingredients of a movie I should like (read: James L. Brooks, Adam Sandler trying desperately not to be Happy Gilmore, Tea Leone, an up and coming child actor who is brilliant), but it didn't pan out. While watching it, I was trying to convince myself that this really was a good movie, I was just frustrated by the incongruence between the advertising campaign and the feel of the movie as I watched it; but I couldn't convince myself.It seems like Brooks had a good idea, but he could only be bothered to work on it for so long and then decided to release the movie in time for Christmas.It's sloppy.In my mind, however, we should reward filmmakers who make an attempt to make great films even if they fail. Rather than allowing drivel like The Day After Tomorrow to make hundreds of millions of dollars, we should support films that are trying to be something more than what Hollywood has hoodwinked us into buying for years.So, if you have the choice between seeing this film or Christmas with the Kranks, Flight of the Phoenix, National Treasure, etc. see Spanglish. If you're in the mood for James L. Brooks at his best, go rent As Good as it Gets.",Spanglish
302,brydle,Adam can act!,9,1 January 2005,"What a surprising and engaging movie! Great performances throughout and it all gives you many topics to ponder. Well done. My real surprise and delight is that Adam Sandler continues to succeed in such 'serious' nice-guy roles and he truly present this role respectfully. I have always been a fan of his work as he has always chosen to not only be daring, but mostly because he chooses to have fun with his roles. I applaud his focus on maintaining the sincere personality throughout the movie so that we all can see this slightly different side of his talent. I felt the same when I saw Punch Drunk Love.......I was happy to say at the end: I got it entirely and enjoyed the experience.",Spanglish
303,lurpake,Chickflick!,3,24 January 2005,"Only consider watching this movie with a girl you're trying to get or under very significant influence of drugs or alcohol. Only way to see comedy in this production is to use some hallucinogenic substances. The movie has no plot at all and time line is jumping strangely. There are lot's of irrational scenes which make you think something is missing from the film. Even Adam Sandler seems to have grown out of his earlier teenage image and doesn't contribute too well as a drama actor. This movie lasts at least half an hour too long and only thing keeping you awake is to try to figure out if this Paz Vega is any relation to Salma Hayek, due to huge resemblance.",Spanglish
304,dennis1-2,The best romantic comedy since Pretty Woman.,10,14 January 2005,"Wow, Adam Sandler goes from being a boy to a man. He has tried before, and no doubt, even though he is charming and there is that special touch to his movies, this one is not a regular Adam Sandler movie.All the actors in this flick do great performances, even though the children in the movie do not play very complected characters, the director has really made a great balance of how to use some young actors, without putting too much stress on their performance.The story is fantastic, and there are so many dimensions to it. Movies have evolved a lot since Pretty Woman, and this movie is today, what Pretty Woman was at the time of it's release. Mostly so because it is a romantic comedy with a story that no one has written before. It is a movie for all genders and all ages.To see Adam Sandler evolve to such a wonderful and talented actor, reminds me of how Tom Hanks has grown into one him self. So if you are like me, just the regular guy, that watches as much film and TV as possible, without being a pretentious narcissistic smart-ass about it, you will most likely love this one.Describing the story and depth of this movie would be as hard as describing a movie like Forrest Gump. This is a must see!",Spanglish
305,RogerRoss,Excellent Movie!,10,12 February 2005,"Spanglish is an excellent film. Kudos to James L. Brooks for directing a superb movie that is rare to find these days. It was heartwarming and the characters came off as real and not superficial. I'm not an Adam Sandler fan, but Sandler pulls off a great performance and Tea Leoni, Paz Vega and Cloris Leachman both deserve Oscar nominations for their roles in this movie. It's been awhile since I've seen such serious acting and a well written and directed movie.This movie does more than entertain, it tugs at one's emotions. Flor Moreno has a tough life to begin with and she must make a new life for her daughter after leaving Mexico. They eventually find a new life working for the Claskys. I felt sorry for Leoni's character, Deborah Clasky, who was a ""nervous wreck"" of a wife for Sandler's character. Her alcoholic mother, Evelyn (Cloris Leachman) was partially responsible for her daughter's erratic and sometimes obnoxious behavior. However, its Evelyn who also helps her through the most difficult times of the Clasky's marriage. Debrah says some pretty insensitive things to Flor while she works for her and this highlights the racial and ethnic difficulties immigrants often face when coming to America. Flor's initial language barrier, she can only speak Spanish, initially leads to all kinds of misunderstandings between her and the Clasky's.In conclusion, this movie should also get a nomination for best director.",Spanglish

The characters were believable and the overall theme made sense. I just did not leave the theater wanting to see the movie again!If you are an Adam Sandler fan, this movie will be surprising to you.

A wife who can't shut up or stop meddling trying to get people to love her, and a husband who doesn't know anything but how to cover for her with denials. Cloris Leachman will win your heart in this movie even if you're half her age. Interesting how older actors lose their jobs when they ""lose the look,"" and then when they're given the chance, they knock your socks off. (See also Julie Christie in Finding Neverland.)

This movie is unique and honest. The real surprise is that it shows how meaningless and unhappy the rich white people are with all their possessions pretensions and impossible expectations - they have not a clue about what is truly important in life. Flor does. She takes her daughter away from this family before her real beauty is crushed by a wealthy white family which would remake her in their soulless vision of success. Adam Sandler is at his best and gives a superb performance similar to an honest lovable young Jimmy Stewart. The whole cast gives Oscar worthy performances.

Her shallow and superficial portrayal of the Califonia housewife obsessed with self and material things was right on. She was so good she annoyed the hell out of me. Paz Vega really did an awesome job too. I have seen several of her Spanish made movies and was really impressed by her. The kids in this movie also added a lot to the story and did a great job too.

There are so many people going through exactly what all these characters go through that it seems to be like one of the many documentary ""Aviator"", ""Motorcycle Diaries"" and other realism films, but it's really one that one of the most incredible writers of our times put together. James L. Brooks does it once again and captures life in ways that young writers like myself can only have the wettest dream of writing. The 6 given here is incredibly misleading and I am incredibly certain that they haven't come into contact with Spanish speaking cultures, nor do they reflect upon how much diversity is found within our cultures. This is a film that brings it all to life. Just watching it and other films that Paz Vega has starred in and things written by James L. Brooks, bring it altogether. Sweetlyric",Spanglish

Even the child artists performed really well! Towards the end you start wishing that John Plasky(Adam sandler) should end up with Flor (Paz vera). But maybe because you are used to those stereotypic movies one usually sees these days. Though the end is not what most would like to see but the director had put it in a very convincing way. A good realistic movie ! Must see !,Spanglish
317,wcn217,A Movie for the Focus Minded,7,26 March 2014,"In the movie Spanglish, we find one of Adam Sandler's less familiar works where he plays a more serious role. In this movie we find a young girl and her mother traveling to United States from Mexico in hopes of finding a new life and what they found was something they would have never expected. The stereotypical American family in need of a nanny or housemaid would provide the little Mexican family with their first examples of American life. There are moments of heartache and amusement all at the same time, this romantic comedy is surely members of the whole family can enjoy.Adam Sandler portrays the role of the father and caretaker of the American family that the Mexican family comes to live with. This role develops throughout the film; however, doesn't truly exemplify his comedic talents as well as in his other films. Tea Leoni and Paz Vega also share the spotlight with the comedic actor taking their separate roles and giving a deep story to this film. Overall the directing abilities of James L Brooks are put to the test in the film, as we see in his previous works of the Simpsons and the Simpsons movie.Under the direction of Mr. Brooks, the film continues with lives of Adam Sandler's children. His son and daughter both become well acquainted with their new Mexican maid and allow her to become part of the family; however, she is treated very bizarrely by Sandler's wife. Her actions cause the entire Mexican family to go into chaos because of how corrupted her own life even is. This part in the movie is hard to grasp and comes up almost consistently. The various clashes of social lives and ethical standards really collide in this film and are well developed with a basic understanding. This movie is certainly for the educated one.This movie, unlike Adam's other films, is directed for adult viewers and would end up being confusing and/or boring for the youth. The film does not highlight the directing work of James Brooks and is often regarded as one of his lesser known works. Spanglish is a good film and certainly tries to spread a message of the possible equality and connections we make with others in different ethical and social standing to ourselves. This movie definitely has its flaws but to the educated scholar or reader of similar topics, this movie would catch an eye.",Spanglish
318,jla217,Riveting Piece!,7,26 March 2014,"The cinematic work ""Spanglish"" by James L. Brooks is an intriguing tale of a Mexican woman and her daughter who travel to Los Angeles. While seeking employment, the mother, played by Paz Vega, finds employment as a housekeeper/nanny with a well off family. Though initially reluctant, she agrees to accept the family's live in position because they agreed to let her daughter live in too. Living in a new place with a new family Flor comes to know all the members of the Clasky family over time. With a dramatic and energetic mother Deborah Clasky, and an intriguing restaurateur father John Clasky (played by Adam Sandler), the Clasky family presents an interesting time for Flor and her daughter. Deborah's heavy drinking mother who was a former jazz singer, Evelyn, notices that her daughter is in need of support, and is there for her more. When Flor and her daughter Christina spend more time at the Clasky residence they both make efforts in education. Flor learned English for the sake of her family, and Christiana made strong academics efforts when she was presented with the opportunity of a private education. Though all seems to be going well, as soon as Flor and John establish a romantic connection, all begins to change. With a dramatic, yet comedic tone I feel that the film earns a solid 7 out of 10. It is a film that presents a solid cast, interesting storyline, and a balance of cinematic genre.My favorite scene was the restaurant scene. Through the use of various cinematic elements, and a strong written script, the scene depicts the strong connection and meaning that develops between Flor and John. Though there are other great scenes that I enjoyed, such as the beginning of Flor's stay, I do not want to spoil this clever film. Other key film review sources such as rotten tomatoes gives it a 51%, IMDb give it a 6.5 out of 10, and iTunes customers rate it 4.5 out of 5. Overall, I feel that though there are a wide spectrum of ratings, I feel that Spanglish is a worth viewing. I feel that though the film was not the best film I have ever seen director James L. Brooks did an effective job at creating an overall solid film. Flor and Cristina's story draws parallels to many others whom travel also seeking better opportunity. The story with its various ups and downs keeps the viewer intrigued as this story unfolds before the viewer. I feel that this 7 out of 10 film, is a nice film to watch on a movie night unwinding from one's day.",Spanglish
319,apekarek,Great acting and outline,9,20 April 2005,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Paz Vega, Adam Sandler, Shelbie Bruce, and Sarah Steele played my most favorable characters in the movie. They all portrayed a strong on screen presence. I completely agree with chrisuab in his/her review. The movie was an emotional roller coaster with a lot of unresolved issues; however, the ending does provide a decent moral ending in that John and Flor were strong enough to do the right thing and break off the potential relationship before it got out of hand. I applaud the fact that these characters, though they had a Romeo and Juliet love that could not at that time manifest itself, that they did not sleep with each other or go any further then kissing. I'm sure I am not the only one who though that the ending would end with the two deserving lovebirds getting together. I plan to add this movie to my collection as it is a good re-viewing movie. Enjoy!",Spanglish
320,Frank-482,Great acting and script,10,23 April 2005,"It's fascinating how such a simple story movie can really be great. Good acting and a great producer have made this movie enjoyable and even emotional. I guess that this movie will get higher scores if you have children because of the parent-child relationship that is involved. I didn't expect too much from this movie and maybe this resulted in my high score that I've submitted.Although the movie it's not too dramatic/heavy, it's important too really let yourself get into the skin of the characters. So maybe it's best to see the movie when your home alone.",Spanglish
321,fsahfh,Great movie! Go see it!,9,2 May 2005,"I saw this movie last night and think that this is a great movie with superb acting from everyone, especially the young Sarah Steele and newcomer Paz Vega as well as Shelbie Bruce, who plays her daughter. Tea Leoni did a great job with her role, though over-the-top, that WAS the point of her character. I was disappointed that Adam Sandler didn't have more screen time, but he did a great job as usual with the time he was on. He's in the movie from start to finish, just often off screen. I believe Sarah Steele and Shelbie Bruce have careers ahead of them and great job on the movie overall. I think this is one we can all relate to!",Spanglish
322,playboi_stud06,Check out this inspiring movie,8,3 May 2005,"This was a very good movie. It explored the life of a young single Mexican mother trying to make her way in an Anerican lifestyle. It explored her hardships and how she overcame them. It showed her experiencing love, heartbreak and dealing with people she had never dealt with before. John loved his family no matter what him and his wife were going through.Deb's mother acted in a way i've never seen before. She sort of acted as her daughter's conscience. She kept her daughter in check when no one else would.In all, it was a good movie and I recommend anyone to see it. This movie is good for people of all ages. So take someone out to see it.",Spanglish

I didn't really get a chance to see the movie at the movies but i got a chance to see it in Spanish class. The story really touched me. My attention was on the movie the whole time. i really enjoyed it. it had everything a movie needs. It was funny, sad, and serious at the same time. I think Hispanic women can relate to the story in a way. I really enjoyed it and i think everyone should see it. I enjoyed it and i hope you enjoy it too! its everything you'll wanna see in a good movie. you'll cry and laugh. you'll enjoy yourself. i hope you like it as much as i did! its a wonderful movie for the whole family! enjoy!!",Spanglish
324,tarver142006,Spanglish was a movie about a mother and her daughter coming to America in search for a better life.,8,3 May 2005,I think the movie Spanglish was a good movie. This was a good movie because of how Flor wanted to have a better life for her and her child. I think Cristina helping her mother communicate with the Clasky's was great. I also think that Flor trying to learn how to speak English was good also. I like the fact that she kept trying until she learned English well enough to talk for herself. I don't think that Flor like the fact that Deborah was trying to make Cristina more like her and neglected her own daughter. I believe Flor was grateful t have Deborah trying to help Cristina get an education. Flor didn't like how Cristina was starting to act after they moved in with the Clasky's.,Spanglish
325,ZebraFollies,Not What I Expected,4,18 May 2005,"This movie came highly recommended to me, so I eagerly rented it and settled down for an evening of comedic entertainment. Two hours later, I shook my head and wondered what all the hype was about. Sure, there were a few laughs, and I'll admit, I adored Adam Sandler's character, quirks and all. Overall, however, this movie didn't have the funnybone I'd expected, neither did it really have much of a coherent storyline.Maybe it was trying to do too many things all at once. None of the characters was fully developed and most of the scenes seemed to fizzle out. Mostly, for me, what seemed lacking was any sense of real personal growth for these people. I came away wondering what, if anything, could be learned from the film. Well... maybe it taught me not to put much stock in those ""highly-recommended"" films.",Spanglish
326,jbdiamonds,A Surprisingly Rewarding Tale,10,21 May 2005,"I truly enjoyed this movie. In fact, I liked it a lot. It was a very rewarding and pleasurable experience to see a humorous tale of devotion, dedication and integrity without any unnecessary drama, violence, language or nudity. It was a very pleasant,inspiring,humorous interlude set against a series of culture clashes that Paz, Adam, and Cloris carried out wonderfully. This movie is a wonderful treat for everyone to see. The acting of all including the children worked so very well with each other, I had forgotten that this was a movie and not real life. To summarize this comment I feel more movies investigating relationships and differences of various cultures would be a very entertaining, rewarding as well as educational endeavors.",Spanglish
327,r-dimova,It's so stupid!,1,8 July 2005,"I cannot believe that the rate of this movie is 6.7, which btw was THE MAIN reason to watch it..I knew it was so stupid, but the rate here made me to change my mind..it was a big mistake! It was two hours lost time! I could not understand what the movie wanted to concern, or if it has been made only for entertainment - where the entertainment was?!?! It was a kind of SOAP movies..where nothing happens - only empty conversations, which as I said weren't even funny enough in order to make laugh at least. I was very bored and disappointed of watching it! Concerning the content - it was so artlessly for example that the Spanish mother hasn't learn any English words in her 6-7 years stay at America, so her daughter had to translate it everything that she wanted to say. So how her daughter for the same period has learnt to speak English, but the mother hasn't be able to learn at least the main phrases! It was boring to watch how she wanted to say whatever she wanted and every time she had to be helped by her daughter.. anyway don't watch it - it would be a lost of time!",Spanglish
328,jithendra,A very good movie,10,2 August 2005,"This movie is one of the best movies and will make you exuberant.Apart from the actress(flor) in the movie being a very charming beauty the movie has lot to offer.In the wake of globalization the tendency of people to become obnoxious to their culture and imbibe the Americans just for sake of being hip was stamped with a heavy foot.The prominence of human values and what makes a family are clearly portrayed in the movie.Adam Sandler did an OK job in the movie, as a matter of fact anybody else would have fit in his shoes.The role played by cristina's mom depicts a modern woman fighting for recognition in the society and that doesn't stop there,she gets obsessed with narcissism which finally breaks the family apart. This is a wake up call for all the ego driven women out there to realize what they are losing in life by getting themselves into the rat race for fame.Both the kids did a splendid job as far as their acting is concerned.Paz vega has proved herself to be a wonderful actress besides being a stunning gorgeous beauty.This movie is worth a watch.",Spanglish
329,princessbecky_1999,A feel-good movie,10,3 December 2005,"I'm not one to actually get involved with any movies, especially so-called chick movies, which I could see this falling into that category. I happened across the movie one Saturday where I was actually by myself; no kids nor no husband, so I knew it was my only chance to actually watch it. I had seen previews of this movie when it first came out in the theaters. I liked the previews and liked that Adam Sandler was taking on a more serious role. (Usually all his movies are comedies, which I don't watch very often) So I started to watch this movie, just wanting to see how Sandler handled himself in a more serious role. What I didn't expect, was to actually ""fall into it"". Finding myself split between the two woman, not knowing who I should ""root"" for. (Not that they actually compete, but for those who have seen it, they will understand.) I totally thought all characters were portrayed very well; Sandler does an exceptional job portraying a big-time chef at a small restaurant married to a self-obsessed (don't know if that is quite the word I wanna use..but the only I can think of!) wife who hires a Mexican lady as a housekeeper. (now how original) What starts out as a usual movie, goes through to bring out a father who deeply loves his children and his job,while the mother is lost on herself, as so it seems. It goes along how the housekeeper finds herself emotionally attached to the family and ends beautifully. I gave this movie a 10 because I felt the characters were strong and the story line was compelling, making me not be able to wait for the ending. WONDERFUL !!! (Of course, I like I said before, I believe this to be a chick flick...so maybe men won't agree!)",Spanglish

In light of the recent immigrant wars, movies like this one and Real Women Have Curves paints the struggle of those people in a whole different light. The movie is indeed funny at times. The real story though is relationships between mothers and daughters, and haves and have ""less"". The real stars in this film are Paz Vega (nearly brilliant) and Shelbie Bruce. At the end of the film is an interaction between them that will bring an understanding and well earned tear to any parents eye, regardless of where we were born.",Spanglish
331,keywestling,Wonderful film!,10,13 June 2005,"I just saw this film last night and I have to say it was amazing. I found this movie to be both lovely and poignant. What a wonderful commentary on the true commitment that is marriage. Too many people nowadays believe that you are committing to happily ever after. Many believe that it is okay to cheat if your spouse does. Flor and Adam Sandler's character show a strength of character that is very rare to find in these times. It is also a testament to the fact that when there is an understanding of the heart between two people, language is no barrier. Adam and Flor's relationship is a great contrast to his relationship with his wife. He and his wife have both always used the same spoken language, but lost touch in the heart area long ago. However, long before Flor learns to speak English, they understand each other in a fundamental way that his marriage lacks.It is also a beautiful essay on the strength of a mother's love for her children. Leoni's relationship with her daughter is again a great contrast to the relationship that Flor has with her own daughter. It shows the difference between being a selfish and a self-less parent.Great script, fantastic acting. Ms. Leoni is wonderful, as is the fabulous actress who plays her mother. I adore Adam Sandler. He is as accessible and endearing as always. Kudos to him for taking a step away from his traditional, albeit wonderful, purely comedic roles. Please do not see this movie expecting 50 First Dates or Happy Gilmore. You will be disappointed!Excellent writing. I wept for the last twenty minutes of the film. I never became bored with the dialogue.I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has ever been a parent, a spouse, or someone's child!",Spanglish
332,asvetlov,Brave - it has heart and unashamedly applauds virtue,9,17 June 2005,"A gem. Rarely does a commercial film have the guts to be so politically incorrect. It applauds ""niceness"" and sticking to unselfish principles as virtues - rather daring in the ""destroy ourselves and each other"" theme obsession of relationship driven movies. Mainly about loyalty and what we do for love of our children. Sensitive treatment of cultural differences. Good script - quite funny in places, sad in others. My man's man partner also enjoyed it, and we want our daughters to see it. One more positive stroke for mankind on the side of goodness triumphing over selfishness (and the not so savoury end of the American Way). DON'T expect a fairytale ending. Miss it altogether if words like ""nice"", ""noble"", ""virtue"" make you snicker -because you are just too clever to appreciate this film.",Spanglish

I didn't get a chance to see it at the movie theater, and once it came out on DVD it was on my get list.And once again i wasn't disappointed.Although most of the plot doesn't revolve around sandler, it still was definitely worth the watch, using his over the top reactions like in billy madison and happy gilmore.I definitely think this character came into his own, seeing sandler as a father for starters was quite strange, but to me it would be just like real life and him being a cool dad.Overall i gave it an 8, that wasn't to say it wasn't worth ten, but i definitely think this is a great movie, and has many laugh out loud moments, the other cast members also do a wonderful job of telling the story.",Spanglish
334,PatrickBatemanVP,Worst Film Ever.,1,23 July 2015,"This movie was, is, and will forever be awful, truly and thoroughly awful. It did not start well from what I can recall (saw it in the cinemas upon initial release) and I would hazard a guess that it did not end well either.There was no interest generated in the opening of the film, which eventually led to my exiting of the cinema prior to the end of the film's running. Loss of 5 points (total = 5 so far).I cannot comment on plot because a) none was developed in the beginning of the film, and b) I left after the first thirty minutes or so. Loss of 2 points (total = 3 so far)The characters were wooden to say the least. Adam Sandler plays his goofy old self as per usual, but it is hardly what I call acting. Loss of 2 points (total = 1 so far).Hence my rating of 1/10. A pathetic film that should not be watched. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",Spanglish

He reaches for crude to find funny. Perhaps I'd like that type of humor if I were a 17 year old pothead.Yet I rented the DVD of Spanglish anyway. I was running out of movies to rent. I was happily surprised at this one, and at Mr. Sandler. The movie is funny, charming, smart. Sandler does a fine job. He's given no room for stupid. Good thing. It worked.Paz Vega is delightful! The girls who played the daughters will be heard from again, I have no doubt. Cloris Leachman is at her very best. Tea Leoni is just dead-on wonderful.

336,drumscale,This movie was a 10...until the ending.,6,13 November 2005,"How in the world could there be such an awesome chemistry between John (Adam) and Flor (Paz), and in view of the adulterous affair (marrital death blow) his wife has, the movie end like this? I mean, not to mention Deborah (Tia) is neurotic and meddlesome! Her character offers no positive element to her husband or her children. The power of this movie is the romantic interest between John and Flor, not the initial indication that the main theme of the movie is between Flor and her daughter Cristina. Both Adam and Paz's character both affirm they have never experienced another person of the opposite sex like the other individual. They have conflict; they resolve conflict. They are balanced with each other. (Even the dog favors Flor.) Adam is constantly baffled with his wife, and there never seems to be an indicator that they ever had a good relationship, except his constant self-sacrifice to deal with her unstable emotional condition. At the restaurant, at Flor's request, he sets the glass of vodka down without questioning her reasoning. She has a calm and understanding about dealing with John's general identity confusion. Adam cooks for her, and they share the deepest of romantic conversation. She says, ""I love you."" I mean, it's this wonderful build up to a great union, and then phhhrrrbbbttt! Paz leaves with her daughter, Adam goes back to his wife from hell, and the credits roll?!?! WTF?! Had this movie not put so much on what initially was supposed to be a subplot--John and Flor's relationship--but rather the relationship between mother and daughter, it would have been a solid achievement. But I felt ripped off because I was rooting for John and Flor to get together. My recommendation is to shut the film off at the moment Flor runs out of the restaurant and imagine that John and Flor lived happily ever after...because they should have!!!",Spanglish
337,annamackiewicz,I only recommend seeing this if you want to be upset with the portrayals of characters.,2,7 August 2016,"Spoiler Alert!This movie attempts to dupe the audience into vilifying the wife and making the husband the complete victim, and sadly, it appears like it may do so to some.This is a movie that fails to explain the motivations of some of the characters or to give them much depth. I am particularly disappointed with the portrayal taken of the wife, Tea Leoni.This woman is a clearly strained, unhappy, and insecure person whose positive qualities are deliberately ignored in favor of focus upon some questionable behaviors that amount to mistakes many parents happen to make.Granted, she is unfair and unethical for cheating on her husband who clearly makes some effort to include her. He isn't the flawless nice guy that the director may have attempted to create. He is, also, easily seduced by another woman, the housekeeper, although he doesn't physically cheat. Rather than trying to help the wife with her episodes of stress and misery, he just dismisses her with counterproductive humor and an attempt to ignore her concerns. Even if her concerns aren't particularly valid, they should be confronted honestly, and the issues should be resolved for the sake of the family and the relationship that was building.The movie never reveals why the lady cheats, why she is frequently stressed or upset, or why her history with her husband placed them at a disconnect. Also, most films portray couples when they are happy and bonding in a carefree way, but it appears that when the film shows the sadness, anger, and stress that may overcome many women in a marriage, then the director and viewers attempt to vilify her as a flawed woman who ""may lose her husband"", ""whose low self-esteem is good common sense,"" and who ""will never find anyone as good."" That's a ridiculous way of trying to address the problems that a character has. Again, people aren't always going to be 100 percent pleasant, so if they have issues with stress and crying episodes, they should probably work to resolve those without having their character attacked.Honestly, I have never seen a movie that tries to portray a woman's emotional issues in such a vilifying light. Usually, a human being with some emotional outbursts becomes a sympathetic character. This movie reveals how easily women are condemned for simply expressing unpleasant emotions and ever appearing like anything other than the perfectly functional wife.Granted, I am not suggesting that Leoni didn't portray a woman who was out of touch with the family. I agree that Leoni's character should have spent more time with her husband and family and tried to better connect with her daughter. However, it's, also, understandable that she was acting according to a particular parenting philosophy.I don't see a narcissistic, self-centered, horrible woman; I see a struggling, strained, often unpleasant, disconnected wife who needs to build some understanding with her husband and children. She might simply just be incompatible with her husband. Sometimes, people are incompatible, and it's no one's fault. I hate the fact that Debra, played by Leoni, was confronted by a mother who suggested that this was the best man that she would ever get and encouraged her to have low self-esteem. Low self-esteem won't help the lady reconnect with her husband and family. Clearly, this woman was struggling and, therefore, hired a housekeeper to help. She may have insulted her own daughter, meddled excessively with the housekeeper's child, and made some disrespectful decisions, but your average person makes just as many social gaffs. She was trying to help her kids in her own way; they had fairly comfortable lives and weren't physically or verbally abused, even if their mother managed to offend them. She was paying the housekeeper 650 a week just to clean, so if she made some mistakes, then we can forgive her for being a bit out of touch.Both women and men can have some weaknesses; that's the beautiful part of being human if you don't want a Stepford wife. The director may have tried to create a villain, but for those of us who aren't easily swept up by a few examples of questionable behavior and mistakes, we are left wanting to understand more about the motivations and deeper traits of the characters.",Spanglish

OK, let's see... where to begin... absolute TERRIBLE acting, Adam Sandler should stop selling himself short and go back to what he's best at, which is writing funny little songs, singing them while playing on the guitar and shouting a lot. A completely transparent as well as horrifically predictable plot line. A slogan writer could have construed a more interesting chain of events. Over-emotionalism that made me wonder about the mental stability (or lack thereof) of the director. There was only one moral to the entire movie (apart from never watch this ""movie"" again) and it was brutally force fed to the point of bulimia. I think I'm past 10 lines so I think I'll nip this one in the bud and say that I can't think of any human demographic that this film was made for, except brain dead high school girls, as there are too many swear words and a sex scene to be proper entertainment for 'all of the family'.

By far one of Mr. Sandler's best acting jobs so far. He might actually have opened up some doors for some other serious acting. Paz Vega is simply delightful as Flor the Spanish speaking maid. Tea Leoni, did a pretty good job at being a narcissistic bitch. Cloris Leachman gave a wonderful performance especially when she is advising her daughter on how to keep her husband.Though I think at times that the movie plot gave away some of the story as it went along it was refreshing to see that the person who had been wronged did not follow through and revenge his wife's infidelity by being unfaithful himself even though he wanted to and would have felt justified had he done so.I give a definite thumbs up on this movie.",Spanglish

All of the children actresses and the actor that played the son of John Klasky was great. They couldn't have picked anyone that was any better fitted for these parts. Cloris Leachman played an Oscar performance, that wasn't noticed. Tea Leoni was another excellent performance; I wonder how many takes that it took to film the bedroom scene where she told her husband (John), about her affair? And Thomas Hadden Church also played the perfect (no good) character.",Spanglish

I really like the part when the maids daughter tried to teach her how to read. It was good how she taught herself how to read. I think that would be difficult, but it wasn't to her. Another part I liked was when Adam Sandler and the housekeeper got into an argument, The daughter had to translate what her mom was saying. I really got into it that, I would want to see it anytime. It showed how American and Hispanic people work together and help each other. As you can see, the different races do things alike and differently. I'm glad that there is no racism and everybody gets along with everybody. It's very funny and interesting. I liked it a lot!!!",Spanglish

All a good combinations to be in a movie.The actors were well picked out.The actors knew there characters they were played well.Adam Sander was my favorite cause he knew how to go from a funny character to an serious character. He knew wat he was doing. The movie also had some flaws becaususe some parts of the movie the director lost me.but that was the only problem i had with the movie. I could feel the house keepers problems and thoughts in the movie her point of view. She caputured the point of wanting a better life for her self and her child. Never asking for pity,charity.Wanted to make her own. working hard to make a living.",Spanglish
