0,MartinHafer,a loved the little touches,8,11 June 2005,"This movie had a lot of hype around it before it was released. So much, I think, that many people were disappointed when it finally arrived in theaters. There were posters galore and rumors that Jennifer Connelly and Bill Campbell were dating, etc., etc.It's too bad, as it's a nifty little film with LOTS of special little touches. What I really appreciated were wonderful little homages to the 1930s and 1940s--such as showing Campbell flying a Gee Bee Racer (how they did this scene I don't know), extensive Art Deco styling in the movie, the zeppelin and the villain on the zeppelin that was made to look exactly like Rondo Hatton--a very seldom talked about actor who starred in just a handful of horror-suspense movies of that era. After all, how many would remember Hatton and the Gee Bee Racer? I like these little touches.Aside from all this, it's a good film. Great, maybe not, but very different and a nice tribute to the Commander Cody films (which featured a jet packed hero in movie serials).",The Rocketeer
1,TheLittleSongbird,Very enjoyable and entertaining,8,18 October 2009,"I really enjoyed the Rocketeer. No it isn't perfect, there isn't much of a story at times, and there parts of the narrative that felt a little illogical. However, there is much to enjoy, in an overall enjoyable film. It is lovingly designed, with lovely costumes and splendid set pieces. The screenplay is compelling and quite intricately crafted, and the direction is solid. The acting is very good too. Bill Campbell particularly is very likable in the lead role, with his boyish charm and his charisma. While both Alan Arkin and Pierce Brosnan have given better performances, they still managed to give something to the proceedings. And we also have Jennifer Conelly at her loveliest, and she is a lovely actress. The music is outstanding, very dramatic and a pleasant listen. Overall, the Rocketeer is very good fun, not perfect, but a nice diversion for two hours. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Rocketeer
2,Leofwine_draca,Fun throwback,5,7 December 2015,"THE ROCKETEER is a fun, lightly-plotted throwback to the old-fashioned serials of the 1930s, featuring a hero fighting against a Nazi plot via his jet pack and plenty of two-fisted action. It sounds like fun and it is, at least to a degree; it's also a light, insubstantial, wishy-washy piece of Hollywood filmmaking that comes across as a sub-par Indiana Jones.Certainly there's little of substance here if you're looking for proper characters or plotting. The Nazis are bad, the heroes are good, and a series of outlandish fight scenes, betrayals, and criminal plots fill up the running time. Joe Johnston does almost exactly the same job as director as he did with HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS, creating an effects-heavy adventure in which he's more focused on stylistics and visuals than he is on real 'meat'.Inevitably comparisons can be made to the modern-day superhero likes of IRON-MAN, although inevitably the special effects of THE ROCKETEER aren't so great, although they're still pretty good for their era. I was surprised, actually, at how little in-flight action there is; 90% of the story takes place on the ground as various factions fight for possession of some super technology. The movie suffers a fair bit from Bill Campbell's ultra-bland lead - bad guy Timothy Dalton would have been much better - although there's fun to be had from the Rondo Hatton tribute and a still-gorgeous Jennifer Connelly as the love interest.",The Rocketeer
3,SnoopyStyle,old fashion comic book hero,7,10 August 2016,"It's 1939. Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn) loses his rocket pack prototype and decides to abandon the project. Actor Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) hired gangster Eddie Valentine (Paul Sorvino) to steal it. Sinclair's thugs are chased by government agents and leave the rocket in a plane. Pilot Cliff Secord (Billy Campbell) and mechanic Peevy (Alan Arkin) find it and start adapting it. Cliff's girlfriend Jenny Blake (Jennifer Connelly) has a bit part in Neville's latest film. After a heroic rescue, the Rocketeer becomes a media sensation. Eddie finds Jenny's picture and Neville kidnaps her. He turns out to be a secret Nazi agent.It's all very old-fashion and undeniably Disney PG. It has a certain charm and a goodness in its classic comic book style. It does need a little bit more action and less of the setups. In that way, this is also somewhat old fashion. Campbell, Connelly, Dalton, Arkin, and Sorvino are all perfectly cast. It's a fine old style action adventure.",The Rocketeer
4,claudio_carvalho,A Delightful Adventure Like in the Old Times,7,26 April 2008,"In 1938, in Los Angeles, the pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) crashes his plane after being hit in the air in a shoot-out between gangsters and FBI agents in a car chase; completely broken, his best friend and mechanics A. 'Peevy' Peabody (Alan Arkin) tries to fix an old plane to raise some money in an exhibition show. However, Cliff finds a package hidden by one of the gangsters with a rocket with belts and they find that the device allows man to fly. Meanwhile, his beloved girlfriend and aspirant actress Jenny Blake (Jennifer Connelly) succeeds in an audition to make a small part in a movie of the great actor Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) that is ranked the third in box-offices. During a flight exhibition, the mechanic Malcolm (Eddie Jones) has an accident, and Cliff uses the rocket to save him, being called Rocketeer by the public. With his picture in the front page of the newspaper, Cliff is chased by the FBI, the gangsters and German spies that abduct Jenny and forces Cliff to rescue her.""Rocketeer"" is a delightful adventure that recalls those classics from the old times of Hollywood. There is a handsome hero, a gorgeous heroine, gangsters, Nazi spies, betrayals, in a pace of cartoons with a magnificent art decoration, cars and costumes recreating Hollywood in the late 30's. The story has great lines and uses real characters, like Clark Gable and Howard Hughes, in fictional situations. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Rocketeer""",The Rocketeer
5,lee_eisenberg,whoopty do,5,17 July 2006,"It seems like much of ""The Rocketeer"" was just yanked out of the Indiana Jones movies, what with the stunts and all. It's kinda fun (especially the blimp scene), but there's not much that we haven't seen before. I don't know much about Bill Campbell, but the presence of Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton and Paul Sorvino should have improved the movie a lot more. Then again, it is a Disney movie, so we probably shouldn't expect anything really high quality.So, there are much better movies out there. This is the sort of thing that you watch when there's absolutely nothing else available. Still, Jennifer Connelly is pretty hot.",The Rocketeer
6,jboothmillard,Rocketeer,6,10 August 2013,"I knew about this film mainly because I had seen a clip of the fourth James Bond 007 actor as the bad guy with a moustache, and I was interested to see a Disney film based on a comic book, from director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Jumanji, Jurassic Park III). Basically, set in 1938, Los Angeles, as World War II is beginning, stunt pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) has his plane hit in midair when he is caught in the middle of a shootout between gangsters and FBI agents, so his best friend and trusted mechanic A. 'Peevy' Peabody (Alan Arkin) tries to fix an old plane for an exhibition show to raise money. One night however they find a package, that was hidden by a gangster, almost in the middle of nowhere, and it contains a rocket with back belts, and testing this out it gives the wearer the ability to fly. While Cliff perfects his skills of flying with this rocket pack on his back, and given a newly designed safety helmet (hiding his identity), his aspiring actress girlfriend Jenny Blake (Jennifer Connelly) has succeeded in getting a small part in a new movie, working alongside third ranking box office star Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton). At a flight exhibition an accident occurs with mechanic Malcolm (Eddie Jones), and Cliff puts on his helmet and the rocket pack to save him, and saving the man's life he is branded a hero by the public and named The Rocketeer. Sinclair, who has a double life and a darker side, has been looking for the rocket himself, and when he overhears a conversation between Cliff and Jenny, he decides to charm the young woman in the hope of finding out more about how to get to the rocket. Cliff and his alter ego are being targeted by the FBI, gangsters and German Nazi spies, and Sinclair eventually reveals himself as a Nazi villain himself, and kidnaps Jenny in order to get the rocket he wants back. In the end The Rocketeer rescues Jenny, Sinclair is defeated and the rocket destroyed together, and having revealed his identity to filmmaker and aviator Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn), who invented the rocket, Cliff is rewarded for doing good with a new plane. Also starring Paul Sorvino as Eddie Valentine, Ed Lauter as Fitch, James Handy as Wooly, Jon Polito as Bigelow and William Sanderson as Skeets. The acting is all fine, particularly Connelly as the sweet young woman caught in the middle of the hero and the villain, and Dalton is great as the charming but lovably evil Nazi villain, it is a simple enough story of a good guy using something sought by others to do good deeds, and there are some fun action scenes, a fun fantasy adventure. Good!",The Rocketeer
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Enjoyed It, But Can't Help Feeling It Could Have Been Better",7,28 May 2006,"A decent adventure story that has its moments but could have been far more interesting. That's a one-sentence description I would have of this movie, which I have seen several times. I keep expecting it to be better than what it turns out to be. I like it, but there is just something missing.I love the late 1930s look to this film, which has great color and sound and a likable hero in ""Cliff Secord,"" played by Bill Campbell. The rest of the cast is pretty attractive with Jennifer Connelly, Timothy Dalton, Alan Arkin and Paul Sorvino - another reason this film should have been more memorable.The rocket scenes were terrific. I just wish they had more of them, or that the ""rocketeer"" had used his rocket to help more people than just his girlfriend.The action scenes are a bit hokey but some subtle comedy helped make this Disney action flick intriguing enough for a couple of viewings.",The Rocketeer
8,BA_Harrison,Blast it! This could have been awesome; instead it's just moderately entertaining.,6,12 July 2011,"When an elderly colleague experiences trouble during a stunt show, pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) straps on the mysterious prototype jet-pack found stashed in the cockpit of his plane and unwittingly becomes the news sensation known as The Rocketeer; he also becomes the target of dashing Hollywood star/Nazi spy Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton), who plans to develop the amazing invention for use in a planned aerial assault on the US by German troops.Even with an undeniably fun concept, a great cast, and every tool in ILM's special effects arsenal at his disposal, Spielberg acolyte Joe Johnston fails to turn pulp-style comic-book Rocketeer into the absolutely awesome movie it could so easily have been. How? With too much talk and not enough rocketeering!For a film based on a character who can blast through the sky with the aid of a jet-propelled back pack, The Rocketeer features surprisingly little aerial action, instead spending much of its time set on terra firmer. There's plenty of intrigue and suspense as Sinclair's hired goons (which include a hulking Rondo Hatton lookalike) try to locate the pack, and Jennifer Connelly as Cliff's gorgeous girlfriend is a pleasantly diverting sight (boy, would I like to get my hands on her massive twin boosters!) but none of this is a truly satisfying substitute for lots of fast and furious, rocket powered action.",The Rocketeer

10,hitchcockthelegend,"I may not make an honest buck, but I'm 100% American. I don't work for no two-bit Nazi.",8,1 June 2012,"Rocketeer is directed by Joe Johnston and co-written by Danny Bilson, Paul De Meo and William Dear. It is based on Dave Stevens' comic book The Rocketeer. It stars Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton and Paul Sorvino. Music is scored by James Horner and cinematography by Hiro Narita.It took eight years to get to the screen, with many rewrites, changes in personal, changes in setting and etc, the only thing consistent was Disney's inconsistency. Once out the film received generally positive reviews but posted only a small profit, in the wake of a Tim Burton inspired reinvention of the Super Hero genre, Rocketeer fell away into cultdom, sequels planned were shelved and its reputation remains to this day one of being a misfire. Unfair say I! Rocketeer is a lovingly crafted adventure film, nodding towards the serials of the 1930s, it's awash with period Hollywood delights, Art Deco imagery, has a damsel in distress, square jawed heroics, Nazi villains, wonderful effects and a blunderbuss Zeppelin finale. Backed by beautiful smooth tone photography and an evocative heart stirring music score, it's a family friendly blockbuster that ticks all the requisite boxes. The quality of the action sequences still hold up today, and Johnston, who wanted the job big time, directs with a knowing grasp of the setting, and crucially he never once loses a grip on tone and pacing. There's no self parody here, no deep Fruedian dissection of the main character, just a honest to goodness good against bad axis, with a romantic cause deftly wafted over proceedings.The role of Cliff Secord (Rocketeer) proved hard to cast, where Vincent D'Onofrio turned it down and ""name"" actors such as Dennis Quaid, Emilio Estevez, Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton auditioned for the part. Paxton, it's believed, was very close to getting it as well. Disney wanted an A list man, Johnny Depp and Kevin Costner were mooted, but Johnston had a feel for unknown Billy Campbell and managed to convince nervous Disney heads that he was perfect. Much of the scorn that has flown towards Rocketeer has landed at Campbell's door, again, this is unfair. It's hard to tell if one of those A list actors could have made the character work better, for it helps in this instance to not have a familiar face propelling the adventure. There's an innocence, an awkwardness to Campbell's portrayal that just sits right for a guy stumbling upon a rocket pack and finding himself submerged in a chase and harry battle against bad. He also has the looks, a handsome dude who creates a homespun based chemistry with the sensuous Connelly. It's Dalton's movie, though, he's having a devil of a time as the chief villain. Modeled on Errol Flynn and the spurious notion that he was once a Nazi spy, Dalton has the looks, the gusto, the moustache twirling shiftiness and a voice perfect for such material. A roll call of great character actors fill out the support slots, with Terry O'Quinn, Paul Sorvino and Ed Lauter particularly striking the right chords.A smashing piece of escapism, no pretensions or ideas above its station. The willingness to tap into the basic premise of a comic book actioner and entertain in grand Hollywood terms, to be applauded. And I do, and I do love it so. 8/10",The Rocketeer
11,preppy-3,Just OK,7,5 July 2006,"The movie takes place in 1938 Los Angeles. Pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) is in love with struggling actress Jenny Blake (Jennifer Connelly) but he can't seem to hold down a job and is always thinking of big plans that never work out. Meanwhile some gangsters steal a rocket powered jet backpack from the government but it ends up with Secord and his scientist friend (Alan Arkin)...but the government and gangsters want it...and the evil Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) will do anything to get it.This film has a lot going for it. It looks beautiful--the costumes and sets look exactly like the late 30s were (I think). The South Seas club especially is a dazzler. The movie never takes itself too seriously (when Campbell sees the helmet he's supposed to wear he says, ""He's got to be kidding""), the special effects are good and I got a kick out of the bad guy made out to look like Rondo Hatton. Also Arkin nicely underplays his role and Terry O'Quinn (as Howard Hughes) and Dalton are obviously enjoying themselves. Still it doesn't work.The script is on the level of a very dumb comic book and the story just isn't engaging enough. Also Campbell is good--he's tall, handsome and has the gee-whiz enthusiasm down--but he's too old for the role. He's was in his early 30s when he did this and looks it. However Connelly is worse--she's very beautiful and can be good but she's a total blank here. Also the costume is kind of cool...but why don't his pants ever catch on fire? No way he could use that rocket device without burning his legs off. That bothered me during the whole movie. The movie also goes veering out of control at the end (Nazis?? A ZEPPELIN???). So it was a good try but misses the mark.Disney spent a LOT of money on this. It was expected to be a huge hit and Disney actually sent out a memo when this was in production--they said every movie they were making was to be kept on a strict budget--except for the Rocketeer. Then it came out and bombed quickly. Why it did is not quite clear and it's really too bad. This could have been the big break for Campbell but it wasn't and Connelly would have to wait a few more years till she hit it big.So not as bad as I have heard but no unsung masterpiece. And again--WHY didn't his legs get burnt?",The Rocketeer
12,LeonLouisRicci,"Underrated, Under Appreciated Family Adventure With Style",8,27 August 2015,"This is one of those that Everybody Missed. Critics and Audiences were Lukewarm about this Fantastic, Fun, Family Film. What it lacks in Edge it makes up for in Warm, Vibrant, Stylish, Retro Art Deco Appeal.Nostalgia plays an important part in the Enjoyment of the Movie. Dave Stevens Comics were all about Nostalgia. The Thirties Serials, Hollywood Stars, and of course Betty Page. Jennifer Connelly Plays ""Bettie Page"" the Rocketeer's Girlfriend (although the name was changed) and Curvacious Pin-Up Queen.The rest of the Cast is Highlighted by some Good Actors like Timothy Dalton as an Errol Flynn Type, Paul Sorvino as a Patriotic Gangster, and Alan Arkin as the Titular Character's Mentor and Friend. Kudos must also be Awarded to Terry O' Quinn as Howard Hughes.Billy Campbell makes for a Stiff Lead, but it is the Production Design and Innocent Appeal that is the Charm of the Underrated Film. It Looks Great and captures the Time precisely. Even the Mood is Right. Maybe not the Mood of the Real World of the Late Thirties but certainly the Mood of Hollywood Films at the Time.There are Nazis, Hydrogen Blimps, spitting Machine Guns, Cool and Sleek Little Airplanes Zipping about, and of course the Rocket Pack that was on the Minds of Inventors and Pulp Sci-Fi Fanatics of the Era. There are other Details thrown in for Fun, like a Rondo Hatton (The Creeper) Lookalike, the Hollywoodland, OOOPS, Hollywood Sign, and More for the discovering Movie Goer. This Film along with ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (2004) are Noble Box-Office Failures that are sure to, and have, found additional Fans as the Years Tick By.

13,CinemaSerf,Exhilarating action-adventure movie...,7,29 March 2020,"I hadn't seen this for over 15 years but as soon as the opening bars from James Horner's score hit my ears it all started to come back to me. This is a stylish adventure story that amalgamates lots of different themes from 1920s America - gangsters, aviation pioneering and a love story into a tale of good v evil and innovative science; we even have some Nazis! Bill Campbell is largely there for his looks, it has to be said - but as our daredevil hero ""Cliff"" he does inject some fun into the proceedings. He stumbles upon a rocket suit designed by Howard Hughes and decides to master it and put it to good use. Meantime, a comically menacing Timothy Dalton (""Neville Sinclair"") is a British Hollywood actor who shamelessly rips off Errol Flynn movies (amongst others) and is prepared to pay some hoodlums handsomely if they can procure the gadget for him. From here on in, it's becomes a good family cat 'n mouser. Nothing onerous or unpredictable with the script; some decent special effects and classy aerobatics - as well as a nice character performance from Alan Arkin keep this all rolling along nicely.",The Rocketeer
14,Bunuel1976,"ROCKETEER (Joe Johnston, 1991) ***",7,14 February 2008,"This is another comic-strip adaptation I missed out on when it first came out; as it happens, it's one of the most enjoyable efforts of its type and time (i.e. before the days of CGI) that I can recall  so much so that I decided to add it to my collection as soon as it was over! Again, the setting is pre-WWII America  with the villain eventually exposed as a Nazi agent (it was a wickedly clever touch to have him, in the person of Timothy Dalton, adopt an acting career as cover!). Incidentally, I'll be watching presently the former James Bond's other appearance in a film sourced from comics  the maligned BRENDA STARR (1989).While lead Bill Campbell as a flying ace is somewhat anonymous if still likable, he's surrounded by pros  Alan Arkin, marvelous as his mentor/mechanic; the delectable Jennifer Connelly at her loveliest (with prominent cleavage to boot) as his star-struck girl  who becomes a pawn in the subsequent powerplay; Ed Lauter as a hard-boiled yet incompetent Fed; and, of course, Dalton himself  who gleefully lampoons matinée idols and Errol Flynn in particular (since the film he's currently working on faithfully reproduces part of the climax of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD [1938], but replacing the witty dialogue of the original with hilariously stilted lines!). With this in mind, the film features 'guest appearances' by the likes of Clark Gable, W.C. Fields and Howard Hughes (who, given the central aviation theme of the narrative gets a sizeable part  though, obviously, no mention is made of the notorious OCD complex which plagued him throughout his entire life).Despite its generous length (108 minutes), as I said, the film is tremendously entertaining and looks handsome into the bargain  providing wonderful characterizations (including a thug/hit-man rendered even more sinister and imposing by the effects of acromegaly!), effortless charm, tongue-in-cheek humor (the design of the Rocketeer's helmet itself being delightfully wacky) and, naturally, plenty of rousing action (capped by a climax set aboard a Zeppelin).",The Rocketeer

Yes, it's entertainment alright!",8,29 January 2006,"I have to say that I was both surprised and disappointed to see that this movie only has a 'low' 5.9 rating on here, at the moment. This movie is pure and good entertainment, how someone could not enjoy this movie really puzzles me. It has all the elements in it to make a movie entertaining.Perhaps to the most important element to make a movie entertaining are the characters. The characters have to be fun, likable and stereotypical over-the-top. ""The Rocketeer"" has characters like that. Bruce Campbell is a great heroic leading man and Timothy Dalton for once plays the main villain. He is a villainous version of action/adventure from the '30's and '40's superstar Errol Flynn. His fun and almost indestructible henchman is a Rondo Hatton like character, who takes on a small army of feds with just only his 2 guns. Other great character in the movie are the gangster boss Eddie Valentine played by Paul Sorvino, Howard Hughes played by Terry O'Quinn, Alan Arkin as A. 'Peevy' Peabody and a young Jennifer Connelly as the love interest and dame in distress.The story involves flying stunts, Nazi's, feds, gangsters and Hollywood. It all forms a perfect combination in the story and together it makes ""The Rocketeer"" an entertaining movie, that in terms of entertainment is on the same level as the Indiana Jones movies. Joe Johnston surely doesn't make 'great' movies but yet he knows how to make a movie entertaining, which still makes him one of the better directors. The movie is beautifully crafted and told. The time period the movie is set in (the late '30's) work wonderful for the story and gives the movie a great adventurous atmosphere. The sets and costumes also contribute to this. The great musical score by James Horner makes the movie even better than it already is and it is still one of his better works.The movie has some great action and adventurous sequences that are highly original. Also the 'early' special effects are above par and still look acceptable enough by todays standards. The ending sequences in the zeppelin is especially great, spectacular and unforgettableGranted that the story and acting performances are all quite simple but that at the very same time is part of the charm of this movie.Delicious over-the-top entertainment.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Rocketeer
17,view_and_review,Rocketeer should be rocket roast,3,28 March 2020,"Before we got the incomparable Iron Man on screen we had ""The Rocketeer."" Thank God we got Iron Man to replace him. The Rocketeer was just too corny. I know it took place in 1938, but it wasn't made in 1938.In this film Cliff Secord (Billy Campbell) came into possession of a jet pack that straps to one's back much like a backpack. This Howard Hughes creation was heavily sought after, but it was all Cliff's to play with. There was a huge gaping flaw with this jet pack that was not even slightly addressed. And that was: how in the world were his legs not burned to a crisp? At first, I was thinking maybe the flame I see shooting out of the bottom of that pack is not really hot it might be some type of cold fusion. That was until I saw it burning up other material it came in contact with. The movie never addressed that issue nor the issue of landing safely and properly, but I'm assuming we were supposed to just let that go.Both the FBI and some gangsters wanted this jetpack for different reasons. It turns out that the gangsters were unwittingly working for a Nazi. This Nazi went by the alias Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) and was such a good undercover agent for the Third Reich that he became a huge Hollywood box office draw. In his efforts to acquire the jetpack he did one of the most cliché things you could do-- he kidnapped the hero's girlfriend. The only thing more trite than the kidnapping was how the girlfriend, Jenny (Jennifer Connelly), got kidnapped.Jenny was on a date with Neville Sinclair when Cliff came to realize that Neville was a bad guy. Cliff rocketed over to the club Jenny was dining at, told her to hop into the first available taxi, go to her mother's house and not to leave that location until he came for her. But instead of doing that she opted to go nosing around the club that everyone was fleeing thereby making herself readily available to be kidnapped.A kidnapping can only mean an exchange scene which is where all of the fireworks of a movie usually happen. In this exchange scene we had a dormant German army on U.S. soil just waiting for their cue to attack. Allow me to add that not only was a sleeper German Army lying in wait, there was an entire warship rivaling the Hindenburg in size also on US soil ready to airlift Neville and the jetpack out of the country. The penultimate scene was enough to make you slit your wrist with a rusty butter knife. And the climactic scene offered very little as redemption. ""The Rocketeer"" is more suited for kids, but I would even say that kids these days, having seen so much Marvel and DC, wouldn't even enjoy this.",The Rocketeer
18,neil-476,Misfire,7,25 April 2011,"Rocketeer, telling the story of a young country lad who, having found an experimental rocket pack, ends up fighting a Nazi plot and rescuing his girl, doesn't quite work.Perhaps this is due to Bill Campbell in the lead. He is personable enough, but he never grabs the audience with the type of charisma you need in a leading man.Or perhaps it is due to the structure and events in the film. It seems to take an awfully long time to deal with initial set up, and there doesn't seem to be that much use made of the rocket pack in putting things to rights. We came to this film to see some bloke flying around with a rocket pack so let's have some of that, please! Because, make no mistake, the flying sequences are superb. Following the Superman movies (you'll believe a man can fly with grainy back projection or a thick matte line round him), this was the first of a new generation of movies where a man flying looked like a man flying and not a special effect.Alan Arkin is great. Jennifer Connelly is, sadly, not called upon to do very much beyond looking gorgeous.",The Rocketeer
19,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Oh no no no I'm a rocket man,Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone.""",8,24 September 2018,"Preparing for the upcoming best films of 1991 poll on ICM,I started looking for Action flicks from the year to view. Whilst searching,I found out that my dad had recently picked up this '91 title up,which led to me setting the rocket off for a viewing.View in the film:Drawing from the pages of Dave Stevens Comic-Book, director Joe Johnston makes a sketch which he would return to in the 2000's with the first Captain America flick. Closely working with cinematographer Hiro Narita, Johnson puts a dazzling Art-Deco design on the page, reeling in the spirit of Golden Age Hollywood, Johnson stylishly uses Art- Deco whites and blues to colour the high-life society Rocketeer fights in. Inspired by serials of the 30's, Johnson displays a keen eye in setting up little moments,that become patched into the film later, (Jenny's name on the photo, the use of gum) and using the Rocketeer suit sparingly to capture the thrill from the sighting of heroes in the serials.Put together over 8 years,Danny Bilson/ Paul De Meo & William Dear adaptation impressively shows little sign of the difficulties, with the writers wisely avoiding kitsch to tell a dashing pulp tale that takes in boo-hiss Nazi's and turbo-charged advancements in machinery. Unexpectedly becoming a superhero on all the front pages, the writers uniquely have Cliff's unwillingness to be unmasked to push him towards outwitting Sinclair and all those after the suit, rather than use his fists.Becoming a rocket man after Joe Johnson held firm from all the ""suggestions"" from Disney, Billy Campbell gives a brisk performance as Cliff that fittingly gives this superhero a wide-eyed, aw shucks innocence. Returning to the Fantasy genre after a short departure, 20 year old Jennifer Connelly gives a glittering performance as Jenny,who whilst having the image of a damsel, jumps in to join the high-speed fighting. Rolling in with the charm of Errol Flynn, Timothy Dalton gives a dashing performance as Sinclair, whose bubblegum baddie dialogue Dalton delivers with a rich relish, as Sinclair fights the Rocketeer.",The Rocketeer

This was Disneys big release in 1991, and this film is like the first POTC film flopping, they threw a lot of money at this, and somehow, all the marketing did nothing.It harks back to the films of the thirties, where all the bad guys were slick,a nd the good guys were just too good for their own good.And this is where the film falters. Where Indiana Jones had the swagger and the attitude, Secord is all happy and apologetic, and very bland at times.Thank heavens for Dalton, who steals the show as the dastardly villain, who goes from smooth to outrageous Nazi in a matter of seconds. It's pure pantomime stuff, but it works in this.The effects are okay, and Johnston can do this era in his sleep, the direction is flawless, as is the cinematography.It's a shame about the bland lead.",The Rocketeer
21,Wuchakk,In the tradition of Indiana Jones and The Mummy trilogies...,6,22 September 2013,"...except that it takes place entirely in Southern California. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it does distinguish it from the globe-trotting approach of those other films.""The Rocketeer"" (1991) takes place in 1938 where a pilot (Billy Campbell) and his mechanic find a jet-pack that can enable humans to fly. The problem is, the Nazis, the FBI and the Mob all want it and are willing to kill for it. Jennifer Connelly plays the pilot's girlfriend and Timothy Dalton his rival.It's surprising that Campbell didn't go on to greater success after this movie, but I guess the fact that it performed modestly at the box office had something to do with this. Jennifer is in her prime here and never looked better (she unfortunately lost weight and her beautiful curves in subsequent years). Dalton almost steals the show as the dastardly villain.BOTTOM LINE: ""The Rocketeer"" is just a fun, rollicking adventure film in the tradition of Indiana Jones and The Mummy. If you're in the mood for this type of fare it delivers the goods and delivers them well. That said, it's not great. Some aspects are too tame; for instance, they could have done more with Connelly.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles, Hollywood, Santa Maria and Piru, California.GRADE: B-",The Rocketeer
22,Mr-Fusion,"Given this company, a worthy adaptation",9,21 June 2011,"There's something both nostalgic and patriotic about ""The Rocketeer"" that really bolsters the movie's likability. G-men, hoods, dames, Nazis, all wrapped up in a WWII comic book movie that wears its heart on its sleeve - all the while tipping its hat to the Tinseltown glamor and serials of the era. And it does a pretty good job capturing the spirit of the source comic.I liked this movie back in '91, primarily because I was the target audience Disney was marketing to. It wasn't until I was a teenager when I really got the movie's point and fully appreciated its virtues that it made a true fan out of me. It was also during that time that I discovered both the original comic and Dave Stevens' art which fueled my love for the film. And even though they sanitized Cliff Secord's girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly is just sublime here; a particular bonus. I still hope the studio doesn't really go through with those reboot plans, and instead just give this movie some love (almost 25 years old, and we still don't have a decent home video release; this has been getting the shaft for too long). Bottom line, this is one of my very favorite Disney movies.Entertaining on all fronts.9/10",The Rocketeer

24,KineticSeoul,A outdated period superhero flick,4,29 August 2013,"Now I liked the pulp and noir vibe of this movie and the fact that it takes place during the late 1930's is another plus. It even has the pretty and attractive Jennifer Connelly during her prime. I would have really dug this movie if I saw it as a kid or even a youngster back in the day. So it might be a bit unfair for me to critic a superhero movie from the early 90's. But it's just a bland, dull, narrow and predictable superhero movie. When it comes to the plot, half of the movie is focused on a jetpack or rocket pack. And how everyone is trying to find and get their hands on it. The superhero part comes very later and is very very very few in between. I kind of wanted a sequel since the build up is so slow. It just might have had room for what The Rocketeer is really capable of in the sequel. Since the second installment usually has the most room for that, especially for a trilogy. Unfortunately this one did poor when it came to box office so a sequel never came about. Which is also understandable, because this one despite trying to put in some spirit, just lacked the cool superhero entertainment value.4.5/10",The Rocketeer

What boy DOESN'T want to imagine himself with a rocket pack strapped to his back? This movie is well-cast and well-executed. It has the look and feel of a serial from the 30s or 40s. If you haven't seen this movie in a while, you should give it another shot, you'll enjoy the ride.",The Rocketeer
26,CuriosityKilledShawn,A steampunk Iron Man,6,21 September 2013,"The Rocketeer has almost all of the right parts to make it orbit the moon and back, but coughs and splutters and only manages a brief soar. The period setting in the golden age of Hollywood and a pre-war America has all of the innocence and wholesomeness you would expect from that era. The excitement of then-new technology leading to a high-tech future is hinted at, but is slowed down by the plot like a sprinter wading through melting tar.Cliff Secord is a stunt pilot (played by the charisma-free Bill Campbell, who I have never heard of) who discovers a prototype jet pack designed and disowned by Howard Hughes himself. Cliff, and his friend Peabody (a much more likable Alan Arkin) experiment with the jet pack, but never make any solid plans for it. The movie loses altitude here. Instead of soaring into the stratosphere by giving a thrill ride into this new invention the movie too often deviates into a sub-plot with Jennifer Connolly as the girlfriend and Timothy Dalton as the villain, and the best thing about it.What the Rocketeer should have done is establish the new-found jetpack within the first 10 minutes, given us about 20 minutes of the origins of Secord as a new superhero, and then spent the remaining 80 minutes fighting villains. It is so frustrating that every time the movie should finally take-off it cuts away to a story that drags it to a halt.The production design and special effects are all top-notch. The pre-CGI sequences of the Rocketeer jetting around the sky don't look bad despite coming in at the tail end of the optical effects era. The anamorphic Panavision photography is extremely high-key, and this perhaps is a fault. If the film were a little more rough around the edges it might have worked in its favor. James Horner's twee, sweet-natured, treacle score was a misjudgment though. Silvestri or Goldsmith could have improved on it, but I guess that they were far too busy in 1991.Despite its shortcomings it is a shame that the Rocketeer did not end up being as popular as the Mummy or Zorro series. Although Bill Campbell really does look like Brendan Fraser, who was also in Looney Tunes: Back in Action, which featured Timothy Dalton as a spy pretending to be an actor - exactly what he is in this movie. Weird.It's easy to see why it has gone on to be a cult favorite, and it is still worth checking out.",The Rocketeer
27,sol-,Thunderball,7,15 January 2017,"Having discovered a top secret jetpack (like that used by James Bond in 'Thunderball'), it is up to a pilot to keep the device away from the clutches of Nazi spies in this action comedy set in Hollywood during the late 1930s. The jetpack is ultimately little more than a Hitchcockian McGuffin with rocketeering aerial theatrics surprisingly minimal, however, the film works magnificently thanks to its accurate portrait of the era in question. The movie provides a fascinating backstage insight into the filming of an Errol Flynn type swashbuckler and Timothy Dalton is excellent playing a Hollywood star based on Flynn himself. There are also fun brief turns by Terry O'Quinn as Howard Hughes, Bob Leeman as W.C. Fields and Gene Daily as Clark Gable in a blink-and-miss-it performance. The film is genuinely funny at times too; ""you steer, I'll push"" shouts lead actor Bill Campbell before making a stalling truck speed away, while Dalton's adamant claim ""I do my own stunts"" is a fun reference to his recently completed stint as Bond. It is no surprise though to learn that the film is quite divisive. With thugs who are more goofy than menacing and an awfully sweet central romance, the film well earns its 'family entertainment' rating, however, the historical nature of the story with plugs to old Hollywood actually makes the film more suitable to adults. Whatever the case, it is likely that all sorts of viewers will at least take something out of 'The Rocketeer'. The flag-waving patriotism is admittedly hard to swallow at times, but beyond this an amusing film awaits.",The Rocketeer

I can't exactly pinpoint what's wrong but here some ideas : first, it's totally serious and it's unexpected from a Californian super-hero !

32,Vartiainen,Indiana Jones meets Iron Man,6,16 January 2014,"The Rocketeer is a surprisingly good action/adventure film with wonderful pulp nostalgia. The film is based on an old comic book character and that's exactly how it feels, in the best possible way. It simply just reeks that old American nostalgia where men were men and woman had enough sass and spunk to power whole steamboats.For me it's the characters that make this film. Timothy Dalton plays the perfect guile villain, Neville Sinclair, the most charismatically slimy Hollywood lead actor of all time. Every time he flashed that billion dollar toothpaste smile of his, you just want to punch the guy, while hiding your girlfriend and shaking his hand. In a sense, a villain you love to hate and hate to love. Wonderful role performance, easily the best in the whole film.I was also pleasantly surprised by the side characters. Alan Arkin's Peevy Peabody is what I would imagine a poor and more down to earth Tony Stark to be like. A genius engineer, yet his presence fills the screen and when he starts talking, you stop and listen. The same with Jennifer Connelly's Jenny Blake, but in a whole different way. I can see why Neville falls for the girl instantly, and not just because she has some information that he wants. I mean that face and that smile... Good heavens.Unfortunately pretty much the only character that did very little to me is the main character, The Rocketeer himself, played by Billy Campbell. He has this whole nice neighborhood guy thing going for him, but it's a bit too nice, if you follow. The man leaves very small impression and isn't quite identifiable or unique enough to stand apart from other adventure stock characters just like him.But luckily the rest of the cast and the rest of the movie as a whole are more than capable to keep your interests raised and to provide you with a charming adventure with surprisingly decent special effects for their time, some great action sequences and that whole early 20th century charisma. If you like pulp settings, great adventure films and charismatic actors, this is definitely a film worth checking out.",The Rocketeer

With the jetpack Cliff dons the name Rocketeer and tries to save his love played by a very young Jennifer Connelly. Will Timothy Dalton get the jetpack off Cliff?.Overall the film was good. It can be abit boring but still it was enjoyable. The score is done by the late James Horner(an aviator himself).Parts of this film resembles a Marvel film(I'm thinking Ant Man meets Captain America) as the Rocketeer's design is like Ant Man's while the setting is like Captain America which is also directed by Joe Johnson.Watch it.",The Rocketeer
34,hellraiser7,Rocket Knight,10,16 February 2016,"I've always had a knacks for the pulp heroes/comics like Doc Savage, The Phantom, Agent Carter, MacGyver, Doctor Who, you name it. To me it was just how colorful they were in content and each of the heroes always represented the possibility of becoming something more and that anything is possible.This film is another one of my favorite films of all time and it's another childhood gem of mine, I've seen this when I was about 10, it blew me away then and it still does now. In fact this film was the first time I ever really came across pulp adventure/hero subgenere.The production value is great, it's all practical there is no CGI bull crap. I really love how they captured the late 1930's America making this film also kinda a period piece. The 1930's are a great setting for the pulp adventures as it was a time when the world was at war but it was also the rise for new ideas and innovations. The music by James Horner is fantastic, this film has one of my favorite theme songs of all time which of course is the Rocketeer theme, it fits so well as it has an adventurous tune to it.I really like the story which is a stretch but that's what I love about it and it's true to the pulps most of those stories always had colorful simple outlandish plots. This plot line could of been an episode for the TV Show ""Agent Carter"".I really like the characters, Timmaty Dalton one of my favorite actors is solid as the antagonist Neville Sinclair whom is basically an evil Errol Flynn that is really a Nazi spy. I really love that concept which I think is creative idea an enemy spy hiding in plain sight by being an celebrity. Yeah it's kinda a stretch from the odds it takes anyone to even reach celeb status in their acting careers. But that is part of the fun and whose to say it's might not be possible. Jennifer Conolly one of my favorite actresses is great as Jenny, I remember having a crush on her when I was a kid. She is just so fraking hot and beautiful with the persona to boot. I really liked seeing back and forth between both Cliff and her, I like the fact these are two people that are in a relationship which to me makes the romance all the more interesting. Despite being opposites you can see both are right for each other just like the after burners on the rocket pack both are hot enough for one another to fire up and fly. But they do have two things in common as both are people struggling to make their dreams come true and support each other personally but also in dire circumstances.Bill Cambell whom is an underrated actor is great as Clifford Secord/The Rocketeer and this is my favorite role from him. He's an all American guy whom is idealistic and he is an underdog as he is constantly struggling to make his dreams in aviation come true as well as things with his significant other work out. That's why we like him and we're on his side because he's a guy we can easily relate to, because that's something well all do everyday. The action is solid the sequences with the rocket are awesome, the cinematography and effects really capture the illusion of flight perfectly I was practically moving at my seat, just seeing that rocket in action I wanted one. Though it's true there is an inconsistence or two, like where the heck the fuel gage is for the rocket, isn't it important to know that if you want to stay up in the air, let alone not fall. Also why is it his pants aren't on fire when the after burners are on, are they made of some fireproof fiber? But I think that was probably intentional and what made it true to the pulp adventure stories, where they were always more concerned with story and the fun of it and left logic on the shelf.It's true that Clifford isn't too smooth with the rocket flight but that makes the action a bit more realistic if you can believe that. When you think about it in physics/aerodynamics logic it would be pretty darn hard to control.I also really like that there is a bit of a parallel contrast between both Cliff and Nevelle Sinclair. Nevelle Sinclair is by his nature a counterfeit person he is an actor that plays heroes but really isn't one. When it comes to being nice and charm you can easily see in his face it's not really in his nature to be nice at all and when he put it on it seems like he's trying a bit too hard. Also the guy a bit narcissistic as he is concerned about looks, in one scene we see him checking if there's something between his teeth.Cliff is a true hero because he is truthful about himself and his own ideals. Yeah, he doesn't have all the breaks as Nevelle has but he's not asking for them. And throughout the film most of the time he gets dirty and has kicks and scrapes but he still looks good much as Lara Croft does in the Tomb Raider games. And he does what any hero should to which is his job.The only bad thing about the film is that Cliff/The Rocketeer doesn't get to kick enough ass. It would of been cool seeing in the shootout scene him taking a machine gun or even using the hand gun and flying around shooting at Nazis. But then again Cliff isn't a trained fighter, so oh well.The Rocketeer flies high.Rating: 4 stars",The Rocketeer

36,jadavix,Thank god that's over,5,9 February 2020,"""The Rocketeer"" is one of the movies I remembered watching from my childhood, but could barely remember anything about. All I really remembered was the ironically named Tiny Ron as Lothar, wearing makeup and prosthetics to make him look like the tragic Rondo Hatton, who was in movies around the time ""Rocketeer"" is set (1938).Some of it came back to me, though - namely how hard to follow the movie is, the plot seeming unnecessarily complicated and inscrutable. I was encouraged by the opening credits, in which I saw many great character actors, such as Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton, Paul Sorvino, Terry O'Quinn, Ed Lauter, Jon Polito, William Sanderson...Seeing so many names I recognized, perhaps I should have smelt another problem ahead of time, intertwined with that one: the movie has too many characters. Howard Hughes has created a jet pack, referred to simply as a rocket, and the mafia try to steal it. They are working for nazis. The FBI are after them. The nazis are working for a movie star. The movie star is actually trying to infiltrate Hollywood. Somehow - and I never got this back in the '90s, and didn't get it now either - the rocket ends up in the plane of a simple farm boy, who gets his brilliant mad scientist friend to make him a helmet. He's in love with a beautiful aspiring actress. She's wooed by an English movie star.It is perhaps not surprising that Bill Campbell's movie star career didn't take off after this. He has looks and charisma in spades, but he's dwarfed by everything else in the movie. It almost seems like the movie would work without his character, which is strange, since he's the protagonist.",The Rocketeer

Add some early aviation nostalgia, a little tongue-in-cheek patriotism, and a mock-Hindenburg disaster climax, and the result is a certified crowd pleaser with more heart than most. The plot loses steam when it stalls on a routine damsel-in-distress formula, but the script neatly fills in some of the more awkward gaps in the original graphic novel (most of us would call it a comic book), and offers a better defined set of villains, including Timothy Dalton as a swashbuckling movie star/enemy agent modeled after Errol Flynn.

Set during the waning years of the great depression, it's a snapshot of a very specific period when America was beginning to pick itself up by the bootstraps, the atomic age was looming and not even the sky was the limit. At heart it's a silly, grinning action gimmick that's backed by a tried-and-true storyline and a stylish, art-deco-meets-dusty-barnstormer sense of fashion. Although the plot is inherently cheesy and predictable, it's straight-laced and innocent enough, a clear homage to '30s adventure serials, that I was willing to let most of those shortcomings slide. The special effects haven't aged well at all, though, with several obvious green screens and a few rough, quick cuts sticking out in all the wrong ways. Timothy Dalton is disappointing as the pencil-stached villainous saboteur, but Jennifer Connelly and leading man Bill Campbell fully commit to the premise, picking up the slack adequately.

40,CubsandCulture,A fantastic throwback to the serials of the 30's-40's,10,23 November 2020,"The thing that strikes me the most about this film is how much of it I remembered. I have only seen it 2 or 3 times. I saw in the theater back in 1991, once or twice, when I was about 7 years old. And I re-watched it yesterday; I'm now 36 years old. I remembered specific scenes, shots and lines of dialog. I have a great fondness for this sort of cornball Americana that found its heyday in serials of the 30's-40's and if nothing else the Rocketeer captures this tone, vibe extremely well.There is no great depth to anything here but it plays with a zany, manic energy that does what the great adventure films do; gives you a sense of wonder and it is all so fun. Johnston has a real knack for re-creating 40's style pulp and that strength is in full display here. There is a purity to this film in that there is no 90's irony, cynicism to the proceedings. The film is simple, and straightforward in the best possible way.Acting is mostly beside the point in flicks like this but Arkin is his charming self, Campbell makes a hunky hero and Connelly is more than sufficient as the heroine. But Dalton turns in a layered performance that is one part sinister, one part charming and one part deranged.Maybe this film isn't as good as my 7 year old self thinks but my 36 year old self is still *quite* fond of this adventure.",The Rocketeer

44,I_Ailurophile,"Classic, unmitigated fun and adventure",9,2 June 2021,"I've been a fan of 'The rocketeer' for, literally, almost as long as I can remember. It was among the first films I saw in theaters when I was young, and I was instantly captivated. The sense of fun and adventure that pervades the length is intoxicating, and hasn't lost its edge one bit in the past 30 years.Everything in the movie is calculated toward that notion of a convivial romp. Casting then little known Billy Campbell as the lead, instead of an A-lister, allowed the audience to focus on the story and action instead of the face. Jennifer Connelly, only a few years removed from her role as Sarah in 'Labyrinth,' showcases a similar blend here of young willfulness, dreamy allure, and fantastical ambition, even in just a supporting role. And Timothy Dalton, fresh from his turn as James Bond, gives swashbuckling actor Neville Sinclair an appropriate mixture of refinement and daring.All that's to say nothing of the rest of the cast, including Alan Arkin, Paul Sorvino, and Tiny Ron, plus smaller parts for very recognizable Clint Howard and Max Grodénchik. And just as important as the cast, and the props and set pieces that round out the narrative, is the setting. As the 'Indiana Jones' trilogy illustrated, the 1930s somewhat seems to represent the last era in earthly history when a story could be told with simple humans - not beefcake action icons or super-powered heroes - and revel in an unbridled feeling of grand adventure. The horrors of Nazi Germany and World War II have plenty of baggage from a storytelling standpoint - but in no time or place since, no matter how clear-cut the line may be between hero and villain, the dichotomy was never more broadly black and white than it is in opposing Nazis. With the emergence in the 30s of comic books, the looming threat of unmistakably villainous Nazis provided compelling fodder for the most bombastic of heroic tales. And so it is with 'The rocketeer.'The movie takes full advantage of the license it's given for wild, mostly family-friendly adventure. A stunt pilot discovering a rocket pack, becoming embroiled in a secret Nazi plot, and being pursued by the mob and the FBI, all while trying to keep the love of his life from slipping away? That's a yarn of some considerable grandeur. Yet the characterizations at play, and the threads of real-life figures and places, anchor the story and ground it with a minor sense of authenticity: Sure, it's not real. But it nearly could have been!The grabbing, highly memorable visuals and props lend aid to that same purpose. From Cliff's stunt plane early on to the zeppelin at the end; from Tiny Ron's unforgettable visage as Lothar, to Terry O'Quinn's dapper appearance as Howard Hughes. From the novel design of the airfield diner, to the fire and explosions scattered throughout; from the jetpack itself, to the first test flight Cliff and Peevy conduct. Above all, the design of the Rocketeer's helmet is a mark of genius craftsmanship: simple enough to suggest it could be created by an inventive mechanic in the 1930s, and certainly so unique that it's the most lastingly commanding image of the entire movie.Through it all, 'The Rocketeer' maintains a clear guiding ethos: This is fun. This is adventure. For all the thrills of some scenes, and frighteningly real ideas broached in others, this is a feature that above all wants its audience to have a good time. It's playful without being silly, and is sufficiently well-balanced that the narrative is never pulled too far in one direction or another without remaining focused on its purpose of riveting entertainment.And once more: By virtue of concentrating on that spirit of adventure, and the visuals that make such an impression, 'The Rocketeer' becomes a picture that has aged very well. It has timeless, universal appeal for a general audience, never becoming so violent that it's inappropriate for young kids, nor so over the top that older audiences can't engage with it. I've loved this from the day I first saw it, and would be hard-pressed even three decades later not recommending 'The Rocketeer' to all comers.",The Rocketeer
45,ShootingShark,"Exciting, Good-Natured, Thirties Hollywood Comic-Book Adventure",6,6 December 2006,"Cliff and Peevy are a couple of flyboys in California in 1938 who get unwittingly mixed up with a stolen prototype rocket-pack, some mobsters, the feds, an egomaniacal film-star and his gigantic henchman, and reclusive billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes. And would you believe it, the fate of the free world may be at stake ...Whilst not on a par with the best comic-book movies, this enjoyably romantic adaptation of Dave Stevens' graphic novel is a lot of fun and a sumptuous Disney production. It does a fabulous job of creating a lovingly stylised thirties Hollywood, filled with gangster cadillacs, swanky nightclubs, Dream Factory backlots, sharp-suited G-men, sinister secret-agents and all-American heroes. The cast are all terrific, in as much for the way they look as their performances; Sorvino, Lauter and O'Quinn look as if they've stepped out of the era, Dalton makes a fine suavely amoral Errol Flynn, Tiny Ron is a scream as the villainous Lothar (whose look was designed by Rick Baker and based on Rondo Hatton in The Pearl Of Death), and Connelly's sexy, raven-haired, head-busting damsel is a dead ringer for the inimitable Bettie Page (and also Brinke Stevens, the author's ex-wife, a knockout horror/comic actress with a hundred B-movies to her credit). Whilst the movie doesn't exactly go for dramatic depth, it keeps coming up with funny scenes, particularly in the second-half where there's a dancehall fracas, a slimy seduction, a three-way cops-hoods-Nazis gun-battle and a fiery finale aboard a zeppelin. With a lavish and exciting score by James Horner, this a minor-league superhero flick perhaps, but an eye-pleasing and enjoyable one all the same.",The Rocketeer
46,a_chinn,One of the best and most underrated comic book film adaptations,9,17 July 2018,"Arguably the best superhero comic book film adaptation of all-time, which may in large part be because the comic is a loving tribute to movie serials (ALA Commando Cody). Disney had sequels and a franchise in mind when they made this film. However, although it was not a box office bomb, it was a financial disappointment. I think the main problems is that it was marketed as a Disney film, instead of being a PG-13 superhero film that's slightly more adult and risqué, especially when you have Jennifer Connolly in a role that in the comic was a not so thinly veiled rendition of pin-up queen Bettie Page. The film and the comic revolve around 1930s stunt pilot Cliff Secord finding an experimental rocket pack, which he and his trusty mechanic buddy/mentor sidekick uses to fight gangsters and Nazi's infiltrating Hollywood on the eve of WWII. Director Joe Johnston (""October Sky"" and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") along with screenwriters Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo (writers of the underrated ""Zone Troopers"" and ""Trancers"", along with Frank Darabont reportedly doing some uncredited work), perfectly capture the tone of Dave Stevens' comic book series, capturing the serene innocence and sweetness of the series, but minus the naughty sexuality of Stevens' Bettie Page surrogate character, which was morphed into ""Jenny"" in the form of Jennifer Connolly, who could easily have captured to same sort of innocent sexuality that Stevens' created in his comic book version of Page. Stevens reportedly had a large hand in the production of the film, and what ends up on screen feels very much in line with the comic book source material. The sets, casting (which besides the always excellent Connolly, who won the role over the likes of Sherilyn Fenn [who'd have also been excellent], Kelly Preston, Diane Lane and Elizabeth McGovern, includes Billy Cambell as Secord (who is PERFECT casting and won the role over much bigger names like Kevin Costner, Matthew Modine, Emilio Estevez, Bill Paxton, Dennis Quaid, Kurt Russell, Johnny Depp, Vincent D'Onofrio, Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Robin Williams, Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford, Ron Perlman, and Tom Hanks), Alan Arkin as Cliff's sidekick Peevy, Timothy Dalton as Neville Sinclair, a villainous Erroll Flynn analogue, Paul Sorvino as a gangster, Terry O'Quinn as Howard Hughes, and a slew of great character actors such as Ed Lauter, Jon Polito, Eddie Jones, William Sanderson, Margo Martindale, Clint Howard, Tiny Ron (in some great Rick Baker make-up, turning him into a spot-on to Rondo Hatton lookalike), Max Grodénchik, famed stuntman Dick Warlock, and more). The film really is nearly irresistible. The cast and characters are endearing and charming. The action is exciting and fun. The romanticized version of 1930s Hollywood is a fun imaginary time capsule that anyone who loves classic films and this period will immediately want to jump onto the screen and live in that time and place (which is most certainly true for me and may be why I love this film so much). Dave Stevens reportedly gave the film's production designer his entire reference library pertaining to the Rocketeer at that time period, including blueprints for hangars and bleachers, schematics for building the autogyro, photos and drawings of the Bulldog Cafe, the uniforms for the air circus staff, and contacts for locating the vintage aircraft that were to be used. Stevens said they ""literally just took the reference and built the sets"". Additionally, James Horner's music is wistfully nostalgia as well as exciting for the adventure and action elements of the story. Hiro Narita photography is bright and vibrant, perfectly capturing the shine of this imaginary Hollywood. My only complaint about the film is that is was mistakenly made as a Disney film, which softened it too much. Connolly's character should have been allowed to be a tad closer to her pin-up queen source material, and the action should have been allowed to be dialed up a few notches. Outside of the Tim Burton ""Batman"" film, comic book film adaptations were not a big thing when this movie came out, so superhero films were not exactly the cultural zeitgeist that they are today, and I believe that if this film had come out twenty years later that it would have been a much more successful. Overall, anyone who is a fan of old fashioned Hollywood adventure films or of comic book film adaptations should absolutely check out this under appreciated film.",The Rocketeer
47,Samiam3,"Watchable, but too soft for a hero flick",6,4 June 2010,"If it doesn't do anything else, at least The Rocketeer will make the 1981 fantasy Dragonslayer sound more interesting or promising when I tell you that it proves not everything which comes out of Disney's pocket is dumbed down, amateurish or child friendly. The Rocketeer unfortunately is.It suffers from a fairly bad case of the gimmick syndrome. There is a reason why its box office success was middling. People twenty years ago (just as they do today) wanna see more inventive material, like T2 or Jurassic Park. Films like the Rocketeer with their, cliché story lines and poor special effects don't seem to cut it. I won't say the film is without merit. It is definitely watchable, but it is more cute than it is exciting. For a superhero movie, that isn't so good.I suppose it would be easier to identify with the Rockeeter than it would be with say Batman, Superman, Iron Man and the rest of the gang. What we have here is not someone who gets bit by a radioactive animal or born in a Kryptonite world, or anything else that feels extraordinary or make-believe. The Rocketer feels much more....umm....ordinary. What would you do if you found and attempted to use a secret prototype military jet pack, only to get yourself mixed up with bad people and subsequently putting your loved ones in jeopardy. In the end, The Rocketeer has its charms and an occasionally self-mocking sense of humour, but it is only worth watching if you catch it on TV and nothing else is on. If anything, it may make a good family movie.",The Rocketeer
48,Sherazade,An amazing period piece!,10,7 April 2006,"This film is truly underrated and too often overlooked in the discussions concerning classics. Joe Johnston (Jumanji, Honey I shrunk the kids) has a knack for these sort of sci-fi sleeper hits, and The Rocketeer is no exception. Weaving that very famous aviation mogul Howard Hughes into the main plot, the film which is set circa the 1930s centers around a stolen jet pack, the mobsters that are after it, the man (Howard Hughes) it was stolen from, and the man who discovers it (Bill Campbell in his major HOTTIE hay-day) and ultimately becomes the Rocketeer, a local superhero. Jennifer Connelly plays a budding actress who would do and believe just about anything if it would get her a role in the next big Hollywood picture or production. She is also the girlfriend of Bill Campbell's character and they make one heck of a smashing couple. Their chemistry is through the roof! Timothy Dalton plays the typical British bad-guy/#1 Hollywood actor but with a twist that would have you hating his guts even more. The graphics and CGI stuff looks mediocre now considering the age of the film but that does not stand in the way of the joyride the movie turns out to be. A+++",The Rocketeer
49,ctomvelu1,Could have been much better,5,14 April 2012,"Seeing this film again after many years, I am reminded why it was a bust. Disney decided to do an update of KING OF THE ROCKETMEN and ZOMBIES OF THE STRATOSPHERE, two exciting serials from the 1940s. Problem is, Disney turned the lead character from a two-fisted crime fighter into a farm boy/stunt pilot (Campbell) who stumbles across the suit and basically bumbles his way through a series of comic encounters with gangsters and Nazis after the suit. Not nearly enough action, way too much palaver. And a Brendan Fraser-type hero who isn't particularly heroic, just fumbling much like TV's THE GREATEST American HERO.. Much of the movie has to do with Howard Hughes and 1930s aviation, which will be of little interest to the general audience. Strong supporting cast, including Alan Arkin as Campbell's partner, late 1970s-type special effects, bland musical score. The love interest is played by Jennifer Connolly well before her DARK WATER days. As silly and primitive as those two old ROCKETMAN serials were, they packed much more of a punch.",The Rocketeer
50,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,My favorite Disney film,10,12 June 2012,"There are lots of early 20th century pulp heroes that have been adapted to the big screen. But few have scored high with audiences. And then there are the ones that gather a cult following for being so unappreciated at the theaters when they were originally released. This movie is one of them. There are multiple reasons to why this movie should have been a success and yet audiences never realized the material within. It may not be Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) or Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) but the adventure is just as filling.The Rocketeer recollects the time when everything entailed G-men in pressed suits, kingpins wearing corsages, sinister masterminds cleverly disguised as other individuals, and damsels' in distress. It is a much- welcomed nostalgic aura because these types of elements aren't always used in the correct manner. But director Joe Johnston, utilizes everything that's given to him and it's done brilliantly. And although it wasn't made the exact way he wanted it to be, Dave Stevens, the creator of The Rocketeer character, which was derived from a popular comic book, was happily satisfied with the majority of the movie.In this film, because Disney sponsored it, the story not only will appeal to adults but to teenagers as well. The original comic book was actually more for adults. Bill Campbell as Cliff Secord was an excellent choice, as was Jennifer Connelly as his attractive love interest. And like many other films, Connelly plays her strong-willed female character quite proficiently. Both look stunning together as well kudos to the casting by Nancy Foy. Thankfully, the writers decided to have Secord already have a love interest and not ""find"" her as the plot continued, like most love stories go. Also the fact that this film doesn't have sappy love. This can drain the energy from the whole plot, making it difficult for the audience.As characters go, many scenes were done in pairs. If it's not Secord's technician pal, Peevy (Alan Arkin), making funny lines, it's mobster Eddie Valentine (Paul Sorvino) making threats to his boss, Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton). And if it's not them, the audience will even take pleasure in watching Ed Lauter and James Handy, play two FBI agents, Fitch and Wooly, who seem to always be one step behind everyone else. And who's their boss? Nobody else but Howard Hughes, played by Terry O'Quinn. The screenplay leaves nobody out of the story and that's good because every character is amiable for their own reasons. Each role was given special care so that no one would be left out off the screen and it shows. The special effects are reputable here too. Some audiences may find them exhausted due to how special effects are used nowadays but all the same, for 1991, that's exceptionally impressive. Not to mention that 1991 was the beginning of when CGI was first introduced from Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991). But when Secord is up in air and soaring like a fighter jet, it's still an eye-catcher today. Some may even call Secord as the Ironman (2008) of his time and in a way, they're right! And although The Rocketeer wasn't a machine, he was the first human flying machine. It's a lot of fun to watch.There is no question about action in this adventure tale either. All of it is appropriate for its audience especially for what Johnston was given to work with story wise. I will admit that there wasn't as much as I had expected there to be but I still loved the movie at the end. The music is great too. The man who created a stirring soundtrack to the movie Glory (1989), is back again; James Horner. Horner may not have made this particular soundtrack to be emotionally moving, but it is profusely joyful and innocent, making it just as delightful. And just like Glory's tune, The Rocketeer has its own theme that's also of one to remember. The conversion of Dave Stevens' comic book hero has a great cast, a pleasant screenplay, and a sensational soundtrack. It's shocking that a film done this well, did not make it big in the movie business.",The Rocketeer
51,lewiskendell,A fun retro hero flick.,7,30 May 2012,"""It wasn't lies, Jenny. It was acting.""The Rocketeer, seen in 2012, is understandably a little cheesy and a little old-fashioned. But, in a good way. In 1991, something as simple as a small-town guy with a jet-pack still sounded like an idea exciting enough to make a movie about, and a pretty enjoyable one, at that. Billy Campbell (Cliff) is likable as a young pilot, desperate to make his mark on the world and show his girl (Jennifer Connelly, at the height of her amazing beauty), that he's a man who's going places. He stumbles onto a rocket-pack that's being pursued by all sorts unsavory characters, and the entire town and his girlfriend end up getting caught between the FBI, gangsters, shady actors, and even more unsavory characters as Cliff tries to save the day and get his girl back. The Rocketeer is basically a moderately fun action-adventure family movie that won't blow any minds or drop any jaws these days, but it's definitely good for a viewing. Especially for Jennifer Connelly fans, because wow, she's impossibly lovely in this one. It's nice to be reminded that once, all you needed to be a hero was a jet-pack, a solid right punch, a girl you loved, and a desire to do the right thing.",The Rocketeer
52,winner55,Big boring rip-off,1,30 July 2006,"When this first came out in theaters, I searched and searched reviews and promo on the film to find one - just even one- reference to the film it rips off, the last of the great serials, Commando Cody and the Radar Men From the Moon.That serial made an easy transition to television, and was played every Saturday - some years every day - on television throughout the early 1960s. I sat glued whenever it was on. Commando Cody actually did look like he was flying! - But more importantly, being the last of the great serial heroes, his writers had learned from previous mistakes, not to let Cody or his friends - or his enemies - do any much talking. The serial was just one fist-fight, shoot-em-up-explosion after another; but, what made this important is that Cody thus had no time to doubt, to question, even to pose - he had to take decisive action at every minute - and he did! - this was no typical wimp (which by the mid-'60s were cluttering up comics, books, and films), this was a Man Of Action! And the second I recall ever seeing from popular culture (after Eliot Ness in the Untouchables).So I was originally pleased when it became obvious that the Disney/Spielberg people were going to put together a remake ... until I started noticing in all the hype, that nobody talked about it as a remake. In fact, nobody was mentioning Radarmen from the Moon at all. And by the time it was 'playing theaters everywhere', the horrible truth had sunk in - Hollywood was going to pretend that its real past - which was also part of my own history - never happened.Well, it DID happen. Which makes this remake - and a BAD remake at that.This is everything that Radarmen avoided - SLOW as mud; unnecessary pseudo-scientific explanations; a real wimp for a 'hero'; wretchedly mis-cast actors trying to come up with a good reason for being there; over-bloated cinematography and special-effects; uninteresting, mushy romance subplot; banalized nostalgia; patronizing to young viewers - everything that I loathed on television that drove me to watch Commando Cody to begin with.This is not an action movie; Radarmen from the Moon is an action-movie; this was just a bad excuse to print up promotional paper-cups at fast-food restaurants.Skip it.",The Rocketeer
53,KUAlum26,Retro and proud!,10,11 July 2006,"I caught this film in the theater not long after its release in the very early summer of 1991. It would go on to be a very quiet release,as the business it made for Disney was abysmally small. I bought it cheap off a Disney discount rack at the supermarket where I worked some six years later and have enjoyed watching this movie very much whenever I pop it in.Joe Johnston directed this tribute to action serials of the past,which places the action in Depression-era Hollywood. Test pilot Cliff Secord(Billy Campbell,more known for his TV work but seems perfect for this particular film lead)is no stranger to danger,as he is one that has been known to work on flying engines that have nearly gotten him killed before. So his discovery of a highly unusual rocket engine that had seemingly been discarded,prompts him to--with the help of his engineer and old friend Peevy(Alan Arkin,dutiful as ever)--patch the engine and give it a whirl. Naturally they are impressed and somewhat frightened(particularly Peevy) by the power this engine harnesses,but they have little time to decide what to do as the Nazis,gangsters and feds go looking for it. Covered in a near spaceman-like helmet and riding jacket(a look that has Peevy thinking Cliff looks like ""a hood element""),he becomes the title character,and will need his speed and bravery to rescue(among others)his starry-eyed up-and-comer of a actress girlfriend Jenny(Jennifer Connelly,stunningly beautiful as usual but not asked to flex much range here as she's been known to).Some very good turns here by freshly un-Bonded Timothy Dalton(As the Errol Flynn-like Neville Sinclair,a screen idol with nefarious designs),Paul Sorvino(as a truly Edward G.Robinson/James Cagney-like gangster),Tiny Ron(as a monstrous Nazi thug)and Jon Polito(as a sleazy promoter)add to the kind of brash,retro charm of this film. A somewhat rare bird of a film,it is(as one other commenter noted)a tribute to the type of ""Two-fisted serials"" of the past,and co-writers Danny Bilson and Paul DeMeo off of a comic book(graphic novel?)by Dave Stevens unabashedly period and straight-forward. The good guys and bad guys are easily identifiable,and the action is as sweeping as it is linear and eye-popping!The producers wisely chose to keep the cast somewhat anonymous and therefore allow the movie to ""be itself"" instead of being carried by some A-list celebrity. Kind of ""Indiana JOnes"" if they'd gone with someone OTHER than Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford.People who either long for movies from the past or enjoy a good,uncluttered action film with nostalgia really need to rent (and perhaps own) this movie.",The Rocketeer

56,vip_ebriega,"Jet-packs into old-fashioned, rip-snorting adventure.",7,22 June 2008,"My Take: A ripping, old-fashioned comic book adventure with crackling wit, terrific special effects and charming characters. Dating back to old vintage comic books comes this enjoyable tongue-in-cheek adventure THE ROCKETEER. Whether it's a simple boy turning into a jet-packed superhero, inventors and their flying machines, Nazis as the ultimate baddies, spies, giant henchmen, old boyish charms and Howard Hughes, THE ROCKETEER is a terrific throwback to the old days of Saturday-matinée adventures. While it isn't especially as relishing as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, a film this one wants to be, it gets the job done, and it's a heck of a lot of fun.Bill Campbell is the hero of this tale, he's daring pilot Cliff Secord, who turns into a superhero overnight when he, and his buddy inventor (Alan Arkin) finds a jet-pack stolen by thugs from the legendary Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn) himself. While his heroics makes an impression amongst the masses, he becomes a target of Nazis and sleek spy Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton in top form), who want the jet-pack for themselves to obtain the key to global domination (as shown in a short animated video clip). Of course, the story isn't complete without providing a damsel for Secord. This in case is a young Jennifer Connelly, sorrily underused as DID (damsel-in-distress) Jenny Blake.Like RAIDERS and the other Indiana Jones films behind it, THE ROCKETEER is a festive of stunts, action scenes and special effects. There's a dozen number of scenes showing Campbell as the title hero gliding past airplanes, as well as a finally climaxing atop a Hindenburg-like zeppelin (not forgetting the face-offs and big explosions). And like it should have been, it has a lot of fun, almost as much as the audience has a lot of fun with it. Director Joe Johnston is the right director for this energetic film, who keeps everything from the action to the silliness all intact. As a former effects wizard, Johnston has a joy with special effects, but he never leaves behind imagination. Actors provide their best, even if their roles aren't especially elevating. In tradition of it's roots, THE ROCKETEER is silly and a whole lot of fun, but it doesn't insult the audience altogether.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",The Rocketeer
57,phubbs,The Rocketeer,9,8 May 2014,"Its a real shame this film bombed so much at the box office, I really can't understand why it did so badly as its one of the best comicbook adaptations around. It captures the all American spirit of the time and harnesses that glorious 30's feel with every frame. Johnston really did superbly well with this film and capturing the very essence of that classic early comicbook/serial type hero and integrating it with that all American WWII wartime effort vibe.Just seeing the old movie poster shows you how much care and attention to detail went into this film. The poster has a fantastic art deco design (from the era) of our heroic lead character, its simple and minimal but does the job a thousand times over, I love it, one of the best posters created. Even the font for the text is absolutely perfect looking.Although the character was created in 82 its an obvious homage to pulp comicbooks and matinée/serial hero characters of the 30's/40's, the idea is simple but it works so so well. The whole film has that Indy feel to it and completes a trilogy of classic pulp comicbook superheroes alongside 'The Shadow' and 'The Phantom'...in my opinion. All characters of the era and all similar in design, typical manly and dashing in smart outfits, saving poor damsels in distress for breakfast.The film is nothing but fun and doesn't pretend to be serious or shy away from the ham n cheese. Dalton is the dastardly caddish villain who is clearly suppose to be Errol Flynn, Connelly is the soppy damsel in distress, Sorvino is the classic American gangster in a tubby Al Capone style ('Eddie Valentine'? perfect American mobster name methinks), O'Quinn plays Howard Hughes amazingly well and Tiny Ron is a character straight out of 'Dick Tracy'. New boy Campbell also does really well as the lead character giving the role a fresh feel and no ego problems which tend to come with big names.The film looks great and has some terrific design work, the rocket pack looks cool and practical with more nice art deco touches...as does the helmet with its rudder fin on the top. Effects were considered very good at the time with lots of high flying thrills and aerial stunts, bluescreen heavily used of course. Nowadays the effects do look rather iffy and obvious but that tends to add to the charm really, it doesn't detract from the excitement in any way. The plot is straight forward but it does get a bit beyond itself towards the finale, like how on earth does a huge Nazi Zeppelin fly into the US undetected? I guess its suppose to be the 30's so who knows, radar not at its best back then huh (well it was in its early days I believe). I must also mention the brilliant animated black n white short in the middle of the flick which shows the Nazi's intentions with the rocket pack. Truly awesome animation that is sharp as a knife to this day, it could easily have been a separate film (or series) in itself.I really can't fault this film in any way, sure its silly but its well worked escapism and an affectionate tribute to the era, anyone of any age would have fun watching this. Without taking anything away from the creators you could almost say its like an adventure from a young Indiana Jones, an early tale from his younger years, a prequel even. I love how they didn't shy away from using the Nazi's as the bad guys despite it being a family film, an important requirement. The Indiana Jones of the skies, fighting the dastardly Nazi's and their incredible machines of war, hell this is really what 'Captain America' should have been like.9/10",The Rocketeer
58,The_Movie_Cat,"""You'd pay to see a man fly, wouldn't ya?""",5,12 February 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS
Sadly, people didn't, and The Rocketeer was, if not quite a flop, then a disappointment at the box office.Set in 1938, The Rocketeer exists to evoke memories of all those glory days. You know, like outdoor toilets, butter rations and rickets. Although based on a graphic novel of the same name, it's source text would really seem to be the old '49 serial King of the Rocket Men, starring the bizarrely-named Tristram Coffin. This is even name-checked in the film.More pastiche than genuine recreation, the script is all ""fly boy"", ""What'll we tell the President?"" and ""It must be the maid's day off."" Timothy Dalton, the only RSC actor to play James Bond, is cast as the lead villain and Errol Flynn spoof. Clearly enjoying himself, Dalton, perhaps not normally known for his charisma, outacts everyone in sight with his pure intensity. ""Bloody amateurs!"" he hisses at the assembled cast members in his house. He could just as easily be talking about his co-stars.For Jennifer Connelly is very pleasing on the eye but also wooden and uninvolved. And while the narrative picks up with the fun Rocketeer scenes, Bill Campbell gives too starched a performance to ever really click.The incidental music is overblown, distancing the viewer from the action. Your eyes see underplayed/lacklustre acting (delete as applicable), but your ears hear a full brass orchestra. It jars badly in places, almost as if you're listening to a soundtrack from a different movie. Satires on Hollywood (Such as The Adventures of Robin Hood parody, ""The Laughing Bandit"") are nice, but would have more credence if this was a good film in itself.The emergence of the Rocketeer gets the central characters embroiled in a clash between crooks, (stereotypical) Nazis and the FBI. The best scene is a real showstopper, with Campbell inadvertently demolishing an entire club, including a giant sculpted snail. Another nice touch is Dalton claiming ""I'll miss Hollywood."" ""I don't think so,"" says Campbell, as he crash-lands right on top of the Hollywood(land) sign.If all this sounds like a good romp, then yes, it's passable entertainment. It's just a shame the acting isn't more assured, the direction less flat, and the concept less limited, as it could have been so much more.",The Rocketeer
59,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"A fun, if not excellent, cult superhero movie with a nostalgic value to adults",8,31 December 2012,"Just a brief note, I haven't heard of this film before nor read the comic book it was based on, but due to my very interest, I decided to watch it to see if it was good due to the reviews I've read. Later, it did and I think I agree to those who still love it that this is in fact of the better superhero movies of the decade beyond the early and late 2000s.The story is pretty interesting and I heard that the users loved it for reminding the adults about the pulp film serials from the 1930s and that it also captured that same feel which was the reason why it received a cult following over the years. Sure, it's marketing was completely lackluster (but not as terrible as John Carter's marketing) and the story's narrative was the epitome of tepid, but those flaws are outweighed by everything else to like about.The characters are hard not to forget. Bruce Campbell played the role of Cliff Secord really well, Alan Arkin is terrific as Peabody, and Jennifer Connelly is a lovely Jenny Blake while Timothy Dalton did a fantastic job as Neville Sinclair, whose charm will soon seduce all of the girls in the world. The 1930s settings in which the comic book took place is realistic and amazing to look at and the special effects are the epitome of magnificence. The action is also pretty good too especially the flying moments with the Rocketeer which are one of the highlights of the film.You also have some flawless directing from Joe Johnston, the same person who was a visual effects supervisor for the original Star Wars films and later made his first directing debut in ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"" ""The Pagemaster"", ""Jumanji"" ""October Sky"", and the later film ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". He built a lot of tense and atmosphere which is a good thing. The best aspect, however, would have to go to the music score from James Horner. It's orchestra is well made with a light-hearted tone to it and the theme song is undeniably memorable to listen to much like ""The Phantom"", whose theme song, although different, defines the character.Overall, The Rocketeer may not be a smart or groundbreaking masterpiece, but it's attempt to bring back the 1930s pulp feel reminded the adults of that time and looks like they will be sure to always remember it. Despite it's planned sequels being aborted due to it's under-performance at the box office, there are plans for a reboot. Some fans are excited while others aren't because it turns that some remakes aren't as good as the original counterparts. Since I liked it, however, I think I'm OK with Disney to go ahead with it. So, all-in-all, this movie is a fun superhero ride that will always appeal to children young and old.",The Rocketeer
60,Libretio,Two-fisted tribute to the serials of yesteryear,7,26 December 2004,"THE ROCKETEER Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo SR(35mm and 70mm release prints)Based on Dave Stevens' graphic novel, this very un-Disney-like Disney movie is a joy from start to finish, a two-fisted tribute to the serials of yesteryear which combines nostalgia for the innocence of ages past with the Art deco gloss of a world on the brink of war. Bill Campbell (from TV's ""Tales of the City"") plays a 1930's air ace who stumbles on a jet-propelled device that allows its wearer to fly at high speeds, a device coveted by law enforcement agencies, gangland criminals, Howard Hughes (!), and a Nazi villain (Timothy Dalton) masquerading as a Hollywood heartthrob.Handsome and talented, Campbell plays the title role with just the right amount of wide-eyed candor and boyish charm, and he's supported by a veritable who's-who of Hollywood's finest character actors, including Alan Arkin, Paul Sorvino, Terry O'Quinn, Ed Lauter, Jon Polito and Eddie Jones, alongside Tiny Ron as a hulking henchman clearly modelled after Rondo Hatton (courtesy of Rick Baker's rubbery makeup), whose speciality is - you guessed it - *snapping spines*! Sadly, Jennifer Connelly is unable to make much of an impression as Campbell's eye-candy girlfriend, an old-fashioned heroine who lacks autonomy and is almost entirely dependent on her co-star's strength and bravery. That small blip aside, director Joe Johnston (HIDALGO) plays the whole thing straight, without even a hint of camp (when Campbell asks how he looks in his spiffy 'Rocketeer' outfit, Arkin deadpans: ""Like a hood ornament!""), and while the characters are mere stock figures, they're played with real integrity by an enthusiastic cast, and the film's many set-pieces culminate in a showstopping finale on board an exploding zeppelin high above the Hollywood hills! Yep, this is one movie where you *definitely* get your money's worth!! Produced today, the script (by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo) might have been co-opted by some overpriced 'star' whose off-screen notoriety could sap the magic out of every frame. It's the fact that Campbell WASN'T a household name during filming, and that the production dares to celebrate the movies of a bygone era without simultaneously mocking its references, which makes THE ROCKETEER so special. It carries none of the baggage that a major celebrity would have brought to it, and is simply a thrill-ride, no more or less, packaged and presented as a widescreen spectacle for audiences young and old (and DO try to see the film in its original Panavision dimensions). Incredibly, the movie underperformed at the American box-office, despite playing in 70mm (blown up from the original 35mm) at selected venues, though it has since found an appreciative audience on TV and home video. Originally released in the UK as ROCKETEER, an unnecessary abbreviation.",The Rocketeer

The sets are great, the story is 40s, the cars, the cafe with the bizarre little gingerbread giving an impression of a gnome's hangout, the costumes, the hero with his wiffle hair style, the airplanes and even Howard Hughes.  What more could you want?  No, this isn't The Matrix with a lot of slick computer effects with mind twisting is it or isn't it real.  It's clear who the bad guys are-- and they're bad, except when, of course, the mob types are swept away by patriotic feelings and fight the Nazis.  It's got it all.

62,Dan1863Sickles,Somewhere Between Good and Okay,6,12 April 2020,"I was just getting out of the Marines when this came out, and while I liked it a lot, it just didn't grab me. What was missing? Not sexy exciting villains, because Timothy Dalton is sensational as the suave, sinister movie star Sinclair. Not a stunning damsel in distress, because Jennifer Connely is incredibly beautiful and unbearably desirable. I really loved the comic book intrigue, Nazi spies on the loose in Hollywood, mobsters switching sides, Howard Hughes contributing knowledge and technology.What was missing was a leading man. Billy Campbell was a good looking guy, but he had no real presence. Not in the fight scenes, not in the love scenes. And it didn't help that his rocket suit made him look like a fish!The one thing that made me look back on this movie with new respect is that for a kid's movie it's actually pretty dark. Think about it. A movie star who is a Nazi spy, openly plotting to betray America, and hiring mobsters to kill the people who suspect the truth. Oh, and he corners Jenny in his bedroom and comes on to her in the most slimy Harvey Weinstein manner, complete with vague promises to ""make her a star."" This movie is a lot tougher and more honest than ninety percent of the ""hip"" Hollywood satires.Looking at you, HAIL CAESAR!",The Rocketeer
63,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,20 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Before Iron Man graced the silver screen, we had ""The Rocketeer"" - blasting through the atmosphere behind the fiery force of a silver jet pack. This movie was released in the Summer of '91 along with two other action films, ""Robin Hood - Prince Of Thieves"" and ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day"". My wife and I loved all three of these films and must have seen them 3 or 4 times each while they were still in the theaters. That was a very good year for movies.When a rocket pack is stolen from Howard Hughes, it ends up in the hands of an airplane mechanic, Peevy (Alan Arkin) and his hotshot flyboy, Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell). Hot on their trail is the FBI, the Mob, and a German spy who is fronting as the famed Hollywood actor, Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton) bent on obtaining the pack for himself. The race is on as Secord needs to save his girlfriend from the clutches of Sinclair, steer clear of the authorities and save the day.This was a fun, crowd pleaser. One that makes you want to cheer the hero and boo the villain. The cinematography was excellent, the action sequences exciting, the acting solid, the pacing spot on, and the special effects on par with it's time. It had a good plot with strong supporting sub-plots and everything came together nicely at the end.I highly recommend ""The Rocketeer"". Sure, it may not be as nearly advanced as Iron Man's aerial feats and stunts, but it sure does capture the movie magic that makes you want to see it again and again. It is a hit for kids and adults alike. A classic Disney film. 8 stars out of 10.",The Rocketeer
64,rdoubleoc,My favorite Disney movie.,10,25 June 2019,"This is by far my favorite Disney movie. My mother took me to see this in the early 90s, and then bought me the VHS tape.I'll never forget this movie, but wish they would remake it. There's a lot they could do with the story.",The Rocketeer
65,DavidSim240183,Strap yourself in!,8,5 June 2007,"The Rocketeer was one of a series of comic book to film adaptations that emerged in the early 90s following the success of Tim Burton's exceptional Batman. But none of these successors were able to recreate the same box-office appeal. Films like The Shadow and Dick Tracy fizzled. And sadly, so to did The Rocketeer.Inspired by the 30s Saturday matinée serials, The Rocketeer follows the adventures of daredevil ace pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell). Cliff is down on his luck. He's a pilot without a plane. His relationship with his girlfriend Jenny (Jennifer Connelly) is stuck in a rut. And his only friend in the world is oddball scientist Peevy Peabody (the greatly underrated Alan Arkin).But all that's about to change. When an experimental rocket jet-pack accidentally ends up in Cliff's hands, he christens himself the Rocketeer. But unfortunately, the rocket pack is a valuable commodity. And there are quite a few parties interested in acquiring it. The FBI. The Mafia. The Nazis. And even the reclusive filmmaker Howard Hughes!The Rocketeer is infused with such an authentic all-American, gosh darn gee-whiz enthusiasm its almost impossible not to like the film. Directed by Joe Johnston, one of my favourite filmmakers, The Rocketeer represents a slightly different change of pace for him. Johnston loves to make exciting thrill-rides that move at a breakneck pace. He did after all create the wonderful Honey I Shrunk the Kids and the quite spectacular Jumanji. But every now and again he likes to make films that are a little more restrained. Like the rather charming October Sky.In the case of The Rocketeer, he tries to meld both approaches into one package. And I thought he did quite a fine job. Its just as exciting as any of Johnston's purely action-packed films. But he also invokes the spirit of the 30s and turns out quite a lavish film.Some of the sets are very retro, but some of them, like an opulent restaurant recall the spirit of many a Howard Hawks/Busby Berkeley picture. But where Johnston really scores is in the action scenes. That's the one aspect of film-making he really does well. The flying scenes are dizzying and even occasionally breathtaking. Just as they should be. And there's hardly any signs of obvious special-effects work. They've aged rather gracefully. Compare it to more recent comic-book adaptations like The Hulk. Where the effects work already looks dated. The Rocketeer runs rings around it.And at times it even manages to be thrilling too. The climax in particular. Aboard a burning Nazi zeppelin that slowly turns into an inferno. Its a real corker of a finale. Its the type of ending A View To a Kill wanted to be but wasn't.The effects and action scenes certainly can't be faulted. The cast is a little more variable. Bill Campbell is an almost too perfect incarnation of the lantern jawed All-American hero. But he's just a little too stolid in the role. He doesn't bring the sincerity that the part so desperately needs. Its no surprise that Campbell has never really done anything noteworthy since.Jennifer Connelly looks downright ravishing as a 1930s up and coming starlet. But like Campbell, she's a bit blank. She was still polishing her acting style since making her debut in 1986's Labyrinth. But it would be a few years yet before she would become an actress worthy of notice.Out of the cast, the ones that probably come off best are Timothy Dalton and Alan Arkin. Dalton is wonderfully slimy and perfectly sneaky as Hollywood star/Nazi sympathiser Neville Sinclaire. He throws himself into the part with gusto, and interestingly, he plays the part like a larger than life Bond villain! And Alan Arkin turns in another archly droll performance as Peevy. He is the first one to remark how much like a hood ornament Cliff resembles when dressed as the Rocketeer!The Rocketeer doesn't quite have the lasting appeal of similar like-minded adventures like Raiders of the Lost Ark and the underrated Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. But its likable, Sunday afternoon fare. It is a snappy adventure, and although the memory of it will probably fade after a few hours, during the time it is on, its quite a fun ride to be having.",The Rocketeer
66,rdoyle29,A $40 million dollar Saturday afternoon serial ... just like Mom used to make,7,17 July 2017,"This film's a bit of a hard sell to general audiences. There have been more than a few knowing homages to serials (the Indiana Jones series being the most obvious), but this isn't really one of those. Rather than making a modern film that references old films, this is pretty much a serial with a $40 million budget and (at the time) modern effects. It's deliberately old fashioned and will work for you to the extent that you enjoy action stuff from simpler times. I do ... so I enjoy this.",The Rocketeer
67,jonathanruano,A film that does not take off,4,1 August 2010,"I suspect that the people who made ""The Rocketeer"" were going for good clean entertainment of the 1950s genre. In that context, Bill Campbell's Cliff is meant to be the handsome, moralistic all-American hero who comes from a small town and shares all the American values that make the United States the greatest country in the world (i.e., he is like superman). He one day finds a rocket in his warehouse (which was left there by some mafia guys) and, with a little of that good old American ingenuity, he tests the rocket, perfects it, uses it and is transformed into an all-American hero overnight. Then a few days later, Cliff learns that the bad guys want their rocket back. We know they are bad guys because they all have foreign accents and, as a certain segment of American society frequently tells us, foreigners ""don't like our country very much"" and they ""hate us because of our freedom."" By the end of the film, Cliff or the rocketeer beats all the bad guys and walks all with an all-American girl Jenny (Jennifer Connelly) in the bargain. If you like to watch movies about a hero with small town American values who beats up foreigners who hate us for our freedom, then ""The Rocketeer"" is the film for you. But if you expect more from a film than a few people who share our small town, white suburban American values, then give this film a miss. When I saw passed this all-American hero nonsense (and it did not take me very long), I realized that ""The Rocketeer"" does not have much going for it. The characters are all two-dimensional and static. I challenge anyone to find a single character in this film who has any depth or who grows as a person. There is not a single one. Bill Campbell's Cliff is just a dull fellow; even more dull in fact that George Lazenby's James Bond in 1969 -- and Lazenby is a hard act to beat as far as dullness is concerned. The all-American girl Jenny (Connelly) is beautiful and (as one reviewer put it) can do a lot for a man's fantasies, but the film makers don't really give her much to do in this film other than to look pretty with bright red lipstick. Alan Arkin, who is usually so good in other films, is also dull and forgettable as the mechanic who perfects the rocket for Cliff. Paul Sorvino, who was brilliant in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas, is a two dimension mob boss in this film. The only scene I found Sorvino funny in was the one when he told the villain Neville Sinclar (Timophy Dalton) that he was 100% American and will not serve any Nazi. Then he finds himself firing his machine gun at some Germans alongside an FBI agent. Terry O'Quinn, meanwhile, plays Howard Hughes straight, which is absolutely the wrong way to play him. Hughes, who is one of the great eccentric aviators of his time, is reduced here to a boring, down to earth, ""aw shucks"" American in this film. The only interesting character in this entire film is the suave and evil Neville Sinclair (Timophy Dalton) who kills his co-star by accident on a set that looks eerily familiar to the set of ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" with Errol Flynn, Basil Rathbone, Claude Rains and Olivia De Havilland. But once again, poor Dalton is given little opportunity to develop his villain image. In short, none of the characters really work in this film, largely because the script lets them down.As for the plot, the film-makers really have nothing new here. The formula is as simple as : man finds rocket left behind by bad guys, man tests rocket, man uses rocket, bad guys try to get rocket back from man, and man saves world with rocket and gets girl. That this plot is spiced up with a swanky night club and stunts doesn't make the slightest bit of difference, because the screenplay was just not ready for production even with some of the gloss. Furthermore, there is very little excitement in this film. I think the problem is that the Rocketeer is notable only for his rocket. Batman at least had cool gadgets to play with. Superman had special powers. Steven Seagal had martial art moves and a confident charisma. But the rocketeer only has the rocket. So unless the film-makers can come up with interesting ideas for how the rocketeer can use his rocket or unless they can make the character of the rocketeer more interesting and charismatic, then there is very little about this film to get excited about. I do not want to say that this film is a complete disaster. There were a couple of funny parts. The first one (which I think was unintentionally funny) was Howard Hughes' claim that an American died trying to get this intelligence out of Germany. Then he shows his audience one of the silliest cartoons ever of Nazi rocketeer flying to the United States and burning down the White House. The other was Neville Sinclair's quip that he does his own stunts and then proceeds to almost beat up the rocketeer. But these little things are few and far between in a movie that is bankrupt of ideas and vision.",The Rocketeer

The Rocketeer definitely gives me the impression of a steampunk hero.I can't recall Billy Campbell being in anything significant since, and kept thinking to myself that he looked like Billy Zane; perhaps it was the hair. We all know the successful career Jennifer Connelly has had.

70,flapdoodle64,"Before 'The Aviator,' there was 'The Rocketeer.'",9,8 February 2008,"'The Rocketeer' is a really fine piece of escapist cinema that, in slightly better world, would have made a lot more money for the studio. But to the misfortune of Disney, this film was released about 10 minutes before 'Terminator 2.' The producers of 'T2' cynically calculated that the summertime movie-going public, dominated as it is by adolescent males, would prefer the steroid-saturated sadism of Arnold Schwarzenegger. 'T2' stole the audience from this film, and 'The Rocketeer' quickly faded into relative obscurity. (Based on the box office of similar fantasy pieces set in the 1930's, such as 'The Shadow,' 'The Phantom,' and 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,' it might also be true that the audience for retro-thrills has dwindled. Too bad, because those films were good. The horrid 2005 version of 'King Kong,' set in the 1930's, was profitable. But I attribute that to the effectiveness of the studio machine and to the personality cult around director Peter Jackson.) But 'The Rocketeer' is, of course, vastly superior to 'T2,' and deserves to be ranked as a classic within the genre of comic book, fantasy, and adventure movies. If your taste runs more toward 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' or the Indiana Jones films than, say, the 'Die Hard' series or Steven Segal, then 'The Rocketeer' is for you.Also, if you thought 'The Aviator,' particularly the airplane sequences were cool, you might get a bang out of this. Howard Hughes plays an important part of the plot, and there is an 'in' joke for you.In addition, fans of old movie serials and old sci-fi should love this. Odds are you already know that the original inspiration for the character of the Rocketeer was the 1949 Republic serial 'King of the Rocketmen.'",The Rocketeer

72,hbs,wonderful throwback to 30's serials,10,5 February 2001,"This movie is what ""Spysmasher"" and ""The Red Skull"" wanted to be, but couldn't because special effects were too lame then and their budgets were too small. It's sad how a lot of critics dumped on Bill Campbell's performance in this movie, when he does precisely what he should -- he's the square-jawed, slightly naive, optimistic hero who is repeatedly double-crossed by the wily villain (if he were less of a Boy Scout and more of a James Bond, there wouldn't be any movie). Connelly and Arkin are just great as, respectively, the beautiful and plucky girlfriend and the brilliant mechanic father-figure/sidekick. If you liked those old serials, you'll love this movie. Maybe the movie didn't have an audience, but if you watch the trailer it wasn't marketed right -- the trailer makes it seem like an Indiana Jones movie, and it is much more innocent (and sweeter) than that. Apparently Disney was planning to make another one, but pulled the plug because this one bombed at the box office. I recall expecting something else when I went into the theater, and being very pleasantly surprised by it. I was also very surprised when the movie wasn't a hit, but I even sort of liked the old Flash Gordon serials, so...Another thing that is disappointing me at the moment is that I can't find any entries for the Spysmasher or Red Skull serials (the latter was the first one I know of with the Commando Cody character, although I don't recall him being referred to by that appellation -- I saw it 40 years ago, and then managed the catch the last hour or so in the middle of the night about 15 years ago one sleepless night, so it's kind of a blur).",The Rocketeer

The reviews cover the plot enough, and there are no real surprises here, but it's great family fun. My kids really love this movie, and I end up watching it every year or two, and I have never tired of it. When it came out there were apparently sequels planned, but it got killed at the box office by T2, which ran over everything that summer, so Disney never did anything with the show. They have recycled the atmosphere and the music in the ""Soaring over California"" ride at DCA, and I have to say it always makes me wistful that the movie never got a sequel.By the way, the movie doesn't follow the comics that closely, which I don't mind, but if you are a purist and a fan of the ""graphic novels"", you might keep that in mind.",The Rocketeer
74,rcolgan,"Fun, Exciting and A Nice Callback To 30-40's Serials.",8,24 June 2015,"In contrast to a film like Indiana Jones which was built upon the formula of 30-40's serials, the Rocketeer is designed to recreate them. And it succeeds, bringing the real feeling of something like Flash Gordon in every way from it's cool look to it's action packed story.This story starts when a pilot, an everyman named Cliff (Billy Campbell), comes across the strange device that allows a man to take flight without wings and soar through the skies. But he quickly learns that there are many others who are interested in the device, with the machine being said to be capable of world domination and his girlfriend being kidnapped in an attempt to obtain the device. Thus he must now fly to the rescue fighting of gangsters, Nazi's and shady agents in order to save his girl. It's an over the top story with a plan that doesn't make sense when you think about it (how would Nazi's having jet packs lead to world domination?), but one that lives up to the adventure and excitement that the film is going for. The film also has a great cast of memorable and likable characters. Connelly plays the girlfriend to our hero, who may often be a damsel in distress but always remains likable fighting back and even saving the hero once or twice. Timothy Dalton plays Neville Sinclair, a Nazi sympathiser who's snuck into the Hollywood scene and is a straight cut villain who comes equipped with his own James Bond's Jaws kind of henchman. And Billy Campbell as the Rocketman, who is the everyman with little complexity and just the guy doing the right thing. They're all the basic archetypes we've seen before, but they're so well played and are very memorable. Plus it's nice change to see a straight up hero like the rocketeer now we're at a point where it seems that every hero must be dark and brooding. And it's always enjoyable to have a villain like Dalton who always seems like he's a short step away from twirling an evil moustache. It captures the atmosphere of 30's Hollywood in a great way. Everything from the costumes to the sets really gave a great feel of the time. The little details the filmmakers went to do have are impressive from the Hollywoodland sign to smaller things like some characters use of slang in the dialogue, it all goes a long way to make the context very believable. Plus by being in the 30's we get a great character in Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn), who plays a Walt Disney type imaginative character who invents the machine and lives up to the creative legend that Hughes is built up to be. Just like any great adventure film the action sequences are great. Beyond the great shoot outs and brawls, the jet-pack sequences are brilliantly imaginative with some well thought out sequences of the Rocketeer soaring on to a moving plane or speeding round a packed ballroom. Better yet this great imagination is also backed by very impressive special effects. The effects in this film are comparable to something like Christopher Reeves Superman, creating a very realistic feeling of flight which few films have seemed to be able to do. This film has everything you'd expect from a family action movie. In my opinion it's a film that never got the reception it deserved only making a small profit at the box office and sadly stopping the chances of sequels. This is really a shame because they probably would have been something impressive since this film was a great adventure and one that should not be missed.",The Rocketeer

I watched it several times on YouTube. I like the film. It's just like the adventure serial films of Indiana Jones and the concept of Captain America becoming the first Avenger. The style from the 1930's is amazing. There were critics saying that they didn't like the film but Disney would make a film that's entertaining for the audience to watch the action.

78,cutter-12,A love letter to Aviation and Old-Time Hollywood Adventure.,9,6 February 2002,"The decidedly low rating for this movie on this site at the time I write this is just appalling. The majority of the comments seem positive yet they are not reflected in the film's overall score of 5.8. 5.8? Shameful. Who doesn't appreciate the old fashioned charm of this perfectly plotted and well acted tribute to the serial heroes of yesteryear. Anyone who doesn't enjoy it on the level it was meant to be enjoyed just doesn't have an interest in nostalgia or an appreciation for pure - and rare - adventure. The film succeeds on every level, if you suspend your disbelief for a couple hours. It was meant to be just a good natured movie movie and it's a crime how it was so overlooked when first released. Star power truly does motivate audiences as a rule and it's a shame because this was one of the most entertaining movies of the 90's. Harrison Ford might not have sold Raiders of the Lost Ark had Spielberg and Lucas' names not featured so prominently on the advertising material at the time. ""From the creators of Jaws and Star Wars"" tag line on the poster assured it opened to huge line-ups. Rightfully so, but just because The Rocketeer didn't have such big names behind the production and because it starred mainly a B list cast, doesn't mean it can't stand right there on the shelf alongside the Indiana Jones trilogy and not look out of place. People should not have dismissed it. The score is memorable (albeit slightly reminiscent of Randy Newman's score for The Natural) and The cast is excellent, especially Alan Arkin in a role which fits him like a second skin. Who wouldn't want him as your mechanic. Timothy Dalton is even quite good as the Errol Flynn (poor Errol) inspired villain, while Jennifer Connelly proves she should have stayed in mainstream studio movies. She is a good actress and we'd like to see her looking glamorous more often. Paul Sorvino is solid as the gangster heavy and Terry Quinn plays a good Howard Hughes. Bill Campbell is spot on as the aw heck, squeaky clean, all-American hero of the title. The role needed the right actor to bravely carry the role off with a straight face and Campbell's performance never gets corny or tongue-in-cheek. It's just...believable. Credit also to the writers who devised a quick moving and clever screenplay. This picture was crafted by people who have a love for the period and the material. No mishandled junk here, just a good time at the movies. You can't ask for more.",The Rocketeer
79,mwcrunner,Amazing and full of action and adventure,10,26 April 2016,The Rocketeer is an amazing action packed superhero adventure and as amazing as Indiana Jones. It's about a man named Cliff who started out as a racing pilot and then becomes a superhero when he finds a rocket which was stolen from a factory by a gang of crooks led by Nazi agent named Neville Sinclair. It also has a really good love story in it and like in all superhero movies the good guy always gets the girl. In the end of this film Cliff aka the Rockteer saves the world from the Nazi's and gets the woman of his dreams Jenny Blake. This film was worth watching and this came out the year I was born just like Terminator 2 and Beauty and the Beast. The Rocketeer also reminds me of Iron Man cause the Rocketeer and Iron Man both wear iron helmets and use rockets to fly. Amazing and thrilling here. 10 out of 10.,The Rocketeer
80,Newsense,So underrated it's sad,10,12 February 2010,I have always loved this movie. I will never stop loving this movie. It reminds me of the time when directors made film with a love for the craft as opposed to these hacks that make films for the love of money. In this day and time you will rarely find a movie that is this fun to watch and has a good story to boot.The plot is simple enough: Cliff Secord(Bill Campbell) finds a rocket in his airplane. This rocket is sought after by mobsters and a Nazi spy working undercover as an actor named Neville Sinclair(Timothy Dalton). Cliff uses the rocket to thwart Sinclair's gang.Bill Campbell is perfect as Cliff Secord. He's headstrong but still immensely likable. Jennifer Connelly is great as his girlfriend Jenny Blake and Alan Arkin gives a strong performance as Cliff's mentor but wise best friend Peevy. Timothy Dalton gives one of his best performances to date as Neville Sinclair. Neville Sinclair is a great villain without being over-the-top with it. I've always like Timothy Dalton as an actor even when he played James Bond. Paul Sorvino's role as the mobster Eddie Valentine shouldn't go unnoticed either.The thing I like most about The Rocketeer is that its a fun movie. Watching Cliff test the rocket for the first time remains in my mind in a place so snug. The director respects the time period(1930s) without contradicting it(like a few directors that do period pieces tend to do). In short its a blast from the 90s that is more enjoyable than the overrated dross that is out now. Its definitely worth a second look.Before I leave I will say this: do not take directors like Joe Johnston for granted or you will be responsible for the onslaught of Follywood hacks. I've seen Joe Johnston's whole catalog of films and have yet to find one stinker among them. He's earned my trust and how many directors can you say that about? Not many. In conclusion support directors that respect the art of film-making or you will be sorry when all that is left are the hacks. Think about it.,The Rocketeer
81,fdbjr,The Score,7,3 March 2007,"There is not much to say about this movie that the other comments have not covered. It is done in a deliberately dated style, intended to invoke memories of the old serials and adventure movies of the 30's. It is an extremely engaging movie, not terribly important, but impossible to dislike.I am writing this comment simply to single out the score. Opening titles and ending credits are just wonderful, some of the best work ever done by James Horner - loud, noisy, tuneful, and utterly irresistible. It has been recorded several times, and with good reason. Almost worth the price of admission all on its own/",The Rocketeer
82,jljacobi,"Good, and better 20-years on",7,22 January 2014,"When it first came out, I remember enjoying the first 30 minutes of this movie, then finding it a bit slow. This time around, I found myself appreciating the tribute aspects a bit more and enjoyed it in its entirety. You'll like this movie a lot more if you know about the era and the real life counterparts of the characters that are referenced and portrayed. Without that knowledge, the movie might appear far more naive than it actually is. The acting is generally spot on for the tribute tone of the movie and both the leads are outrageously good-looking people. If memory serves I developed a slight crush on Ms. Connelly after my original viewing of this movie. I'm sure I wasn't alone. I'm not sure it didn't happen this time. This was filmed long before she joined the Hollywood cult of the anorexic.The FX are nicely done and the science is perfectly out of whack considering the genre that the film mimics. All in all, I appreciate this movie and its honoring the past without becoming a schmaltz-fest. It's an action movie done in a thoughtful manner. I Like It.",The Rocketeer
83,westerfieldalfred,Personal favorite,10,14 June 2019,"Like other reviewers, I'm a child of the 1940s. This film spoke to me like the serials that ran on the cheap TV stations. I can't add anything to the description of the film, but can explain why it's one of my favorites. Beside the grand adventure and period authenticity, the locations are among my favorites. I'm a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright. The villain's lair was his Ennis-Brown house in the Hollywood hills. The Phantom Empire (1935) thrilled me. I've walked through the entrance to Murania at Bronson Canyon. But the film also used the under-construction Griffith Observatory as the exterior of the control room. I've walked those steps. I'm an airship fan, having collected every film that contains them. And as a Universal horror fan, I have all the films of Rondo Hatton. With all three combined in one scene of The Rocketeer, it was just a film fan's dream come true.",The Rocketeer
84,howdymax,Boyhood Dreams and Adolescent Lust,8,4 July 2004,"I liked this movie for the same reasons most people do.   It illustrates that Hollywood can make a user friendly movie when it sets it's mind to it.  The movie was reasonably successful, so there was no reason not to copy the formula over and over again, just like they do with so many others.  I'm sorry they chose not to do it.  Since Stallone, Willis, Norris, and company have pretty much passed into history, I find that the new breed of action heroes like Vin Diesel (do you believe that name?) all blend together.  On the odd occasion that I watch one of these mindless bombs, my eyes start to glaze over.  Kind of like looking at a kaleidoscope on acid.  No story.  No identifiable characters, no background, no nothing - except explosions, car chases, splattered guts and so on.  The Rocketeer may be a cartoon, but it's a cartoon with a heart.",The Rocketeer
85,shhimundercoverdamnit,The Rocketeer,7,11 February 2008,"Its corny, but I really don't care. It's just a fun film.The discovery of a top-secret jetpack hurls test-pilot Cliff Secord ( Billy Campbell) into a daring adventure of mystery, suspense, and intrigue. As he encounters an assortment of ruthless villains, led by Hollywood screen star Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton)who's a secret Nazi spy & Mafia head Eddie Valentine (Paul Sorvino), whose been hired to recover the jetpack.With the help of his actress girlfriend Jenny (Jennifer Connelly), and his gruff old friend (Alan Arkin) the young pilot battles enormous odds to defeat his foes, who are anxious to use the device in an evil plan to rule the entire world.The thing I really like about this film is the whole 1930's Los Angeles feel the film is set in. The costumes, etc. Two other things I love about this film are: Connelly who is so sweet and gorgeous in this film (that white dress, my god) and Dalton who is just so wicked and charming. The way he plays Connelly's character throughout the film is hilarious; he is basically using her to get at Cliff.Between the two of them, is easily my favorite scene from the film. Connelly is basically playing it all up for Sinclair, and she eventually knocks him out. ?I finally played a scene with Neville Sinclair,"" she says. She then finds like his hidden room, and finds this radio. ?Hello, this is an emergency."" The radio then starts speaking back in German! The look on her face is priceless.Watch for Terry O'Quinn ( Lost) as Howard Hughes as well.",The Rocketeer
86,izzypito,Interesting,6,10 June 2020,I have never seen this movie and after watching it I was surprised that it was a Disney movie. This is a movie that should've waited to be made with better special effects. It's not terrible but the plot of this movie gets to be a little stupid.,The Rocketeer
87,andyetris,"Not Indiana Jones, But Fun",10,17 December 2008,"THE ROCKETEER is a perfect, but not great, movie. It is NOT a tribute to the cliffhanger movie serials of the 1930s, its an homage to the B-movies of the '40s: think SANTA FE TRAIL or CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS. Our swell hero and his wisecracking sidekick take some digs from his girl but, after standing up to the swings of the action heavy, close in for the K.O. in the final reel.This is an affectionate reproduction of a simpler time in film-making and you'll love it if you're not expecting the wrong kind of thing. The critics (abetted by the studio) typecast this as another cliffhanger-tribute movie, but if you're expecting a non-stop thrill-ride like INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE or Brendan Fraser's THE MUMMY, you're going to be disappointed (as many were) because the pacing of this film is totally different. Fighting a Nazi on a zeppelin? You're almost through THE ROCKETEER, but LAST CRUSADE is just warming up.I loved CRUSADE and MUMMY, but hyperactive duds like THE WILD, WILD WEST and THE MUMMY RETURNS show the limitations of the non-stop-pacing school. I wish there were more fun adventure flicks paced like THE ROCKETEER; it works if you give it a chance! I'd describe this as a very warm film; at heart it's all about love. Not just love of flying; Cliff and Peevy's comradely love, Hughes' love of innovation, Valentine's love of country - but most importantly, Jenny's love of the movies! And the filmmakers' love of the period shines through in the little details, not spotlighted but carefully there. Plus you get a neat plot and some fine actors having a lot of fun! Pop in the DVD, break out the popcorn, and get ready for a pleasant good time.",The Rocketeer
88,TVholic,"Move over, Indiana Jones",8,9 May 1999,"Back in the '70s, I used to love watching the old Flash Gordon serials on PBS station WNET. So what if the effects were really bad, the acting nearly so, and the dialogue uproarious. They were fun! In the spirit of those sci-fi cliffhangers of old comes the Rocketeer. The Rocketeer was unfairly denied the attention it deserved in the theaters. Much of that can and has been blamed on bad marketing by Disney and a little to its period competitor, Indiana Jones.The Art Deco production design is very impressive. The South Seas Club set puts Club Obi Wan (from Indy and the Temple of Doom) to shame by the sheer size of its dance floor, bandstand, and mezzanine, not to mention its poshness. Also convincingly nostalgic was the coffee shop shaped like a giant bulldog. It may not be as the real '30s were, but it's the way we'd like to think they were.The soundtrack is quite good. It's one of the better and more original James Horner scores. Horner usually has a bad habit of reusing music he wrote for other movies. Melora Hardin as the chanteuse in the South Seas Club does a great rendition of Cole Porter's ""Begin the Beguine,"" better to my ear than even Sinatra's.The effects were spectacular. To borrow the tagline from another great movie, ""You'll believe a man can fly."" And the fight atop the Zeppelin ""Luxembourg"" was much more convincing than the fight atop the blimp in Black Sunday or the Hindenburg scenes in Indy and the Last Crusade.Bill Campbell was the perfect choice for the title role - ruggedly handsome with just the right amount of youthful vulnerability. Jennifer Connolly made a beautiful, young bombshell. However, the on-screen chemistry between the two were not quite right despite them being an off-screen item at the time. Maybe it just seemed that way because the two barely shared any screen time.",The Rocketeer
89,nxgn_not_not,waste,6,1 January 2007,How can something with so much going for it be so totally devoid of fun? That's what keeps me up at night. (spoilers)Nazi's - Hollywood  Flying Machines  sets to die for - Timmy & Jenny have done such outstanding werk else where. & Disney has built up the reputation of making things fun. How could it all fall so flat? I'm going to have to go with the little jarring things that take you right out of the fantasy. The Mafia guy  the little girl in the restaurant scene  the way the blimp explodes  the metal of the Backpack  distance traveled by flying objects V. cars in about the same amount of time  Painful to watch.

90,L. Lion,Production values and no soul,6,28 February 1999,"The Rocketeer looks fantastic. LA in 1938 is colorful and convincing.  All the characters look like they were chiseled from marble to play their roles - Campbell as the dashing, all-American hero, Dalton as the Errol Flynn-like Nazi villain.  Paul Sorvino looks great in great big gangster suits. Jennifer Connelly fits the period costumes perfectly.  Alan Arkin adds good comic relief as the mechanical genius Peevy.  None of the leads has a problem with acting, either.So why does this feel like it's just pretty cardboard cutouts?  The script zooms along and then loses momentum when they hide the rocket pack and the gangsters shake down the diner.  The big finale looks great but looks aren't everything.  Somewhere in here is a film lacking in soul.  I don't know if it's the actors, the writing, the direction...  They certainly put the effort into it, and there's no reason not to enjoy the film, but somehow Indiana Jones and Star Wars grab you on the inside, and this one sits outside and just shows pretty colors.  The production is so slick and well done it's a pleasure to watch.  You could get a lot less out of a movie, but when they put so much effort into making it look this good it should feel good too. Funny movie alchemy.",The Rocketeer
91,folsominc2,Fantastic fun!,10,1 May 2020,"For the first time ever I just saw ""The Rocketeer."" I didn't really know what to expect except that I'm going through a Timothy Dalton phase. From the first moment of the first scene of the movie I loved it. It is full of life, character and pure fun.Only someone who loves movies as much as I do and loves history as well would get all the tactful innuendos in such a great story.From Howard Hughes to the Hindenburg to the rumor that Errol Flynn was a Nazi spy and the last words ""hey goose!"" this movie was full of history and Hollywood history including the history of Hollywoodland.It also had nuances of the movie ""All through the night"" with Bogart where the alleged crooks turn pro-American when needed when invaded by Nazis.
I love this movie and hopes I can find more like them by the same writers.PS Timothy Dalton was superb, smoldering, and stole the show even if he was a bad guy. He also had the best last line as well as making fun of his romantic persona. Great job! And boy is he hot!!",The Rocketeer

No, it's not perfect (hence the 9) but it offers thrills, suspense and outright adventure. Billy Campbell, Jennifer Connelly (in her early plumpish phase), Alan Arkin, and even Timothy Dalton are all well cast and convincing.

93,Aomalle27,Excellent adaptation of the pulp series of yesteryear,9,29 April 2008,"Although the film lags a bit in spots, this is an excellent representation of adapting an alternate source of drama for the big screen. Too often novels, TV shows, and especially comics have been given a Hollywood treatment only to suffer for it. See The Phantom with billy Zane, Batman television series, the Dick Tracy film with Warren Beatty, etc. Here is a great example of how these sources should be treated. With reverence and authenticity. They truly capture the feel of rural life in the 1940's. On the eve of war with the Nazi's, gangsters running wild, and no real heroes to speak of. A experimental rocket pack is stolen and stashed in a barn. Happy go lucky schmuck pilot discovers it, and builds himself into a American hero. His lady love gets involved with Nazi spy, and his Hulking/deformed henchman. A spectacular chase ensues with a climactic confrontation atop a zeppelin. Some figures of the day make guest appearances (especially Howard Hughes played by Terry O'Quinn), and the period piece is helped greatly by the art director and set coordinator, who seamlessly recreate a 40's era California. Complete with flashy nightclubs, over the top movie sets, and characters straight out of a pulp novel of the time. Sinister Nazis is one of my favorite subplots of any movie. Several Sherlock Holmes films with basil rathbone featured Nazi spies, as did a slew of the Dead end kid serials, East End Kids, etc. A real forties feel, and great special effects of the Rocketeer flying, plus a harmless tone to the film making it accessible to kids and adults alike, makes this a great addition to any film collection.",The Rocketeer

The special effects are also good, again nothing excellent, but still nice to look at. The main characters are also very goodhearted and likable. Now on the negative aspects. This story isn't horrible, but it can get a little TOO silly at times, like what the Nazi's plan to do with the Rockets. The villain is also pretty ridicules. Well despite the flaws, this is a very enjoyable film. It's innocent, good old-fashioned fun, so check it out and have fun.",The Rocketeer
95,keesha45,"""Raiders of the Lost Rocket"" fine imitation of Indy Jones movies",8,20 October 2007,"If anyone is entitled to make a movie that in some ways mimics RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, it's one of the visual effects designers who won the Oscar for ROTLA. Joe Johnston also was one of the creative artists responsible for the first three STAR WARS films (Yoda was his artistic creation) and he also did similar work on the TV series BATTLESTAR GALLACTICA. While this film was not the critical and artistic success of his first directorial effort HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS, I think it still rates as one of the top ten Disney live action films of the last 20 years. It didn't quite bomb at the box office when it was released, but it was unfortunate enough to come out on the same weekend as TERMINATOR 2. T2 was such a juggernaut, it was bound to eat up everything in its path. After such huge successes with the STAR WARS films and first two RAIDERS films as one of a group of talented whiz kids who helped give these films their visual style, some might have thought he moved up to the director's chair too soon, even though HONEY was big enough of a hit to spawn two sequels and the ending to ROCKETEER is tantalizing enough to suggest a sequel also. For whatever reasons Disney shelved any such plans. Johnston moved on to make JUMANJI, JURASSIC PARK 3, and HIDALGO, and it's certain he'll continue to make good films.His films are always entertaining and he knows how to fill the screen with memorable images. THE ROCKETEER is no exception. While not in the same class as his later films mentioned above, it does a fine job of bringing to life the old Saturday morning serials, with dashing heroes rescuing damsels in distress and saving the world from dastardly villains. The flying scenes are first rate, including those with the rocket. Interestingly, the special effects were old school, using models and miniatures, without the computer-generated graphics that its box office rival TERMINATOR 2 used extensively and are now the norm in special effects. Old as it is, this film can still give audiences a good ride. I had the pleasure of watching it last night at Lidgerwood Presbyterian Church, with an audience mostly older than me. We all remembered the Republic serials that inspired ROCKETEER's filmmakers and the Errol Flynn-type swashbucklers that make a brief appearance in the storyline. Some in the audience were old enough to have battled Nazis themselves, as do Cliff, the FBI agents and the patriotic gangsters in the end. In these days after September 11th, when we're still, like the Rocketeer, caught up with fighting people whose values and ambitions for world dominance clash with ours, it was enjoyable to see everyone unite to fight a common enemy. It's sad to think that those battles are still being waged long since those nostalgic Saturday mornings. Dale Roloff",The Rocketeer
96,Bevan - #4,Not ... quite ... there.,7,29 December 2006,"It's hard to pinpoint, really. The makers of The Rocketeer plainly did their homework. It's a very faithful reproduction of Dave Stevens' style, they got so many of the Art Deco details right. The cinematography was lush, Bill Campbell looked right as Cliff Secord, Jennifer Connelly was fine in her own role, the director played it without a trace of camp, the script and plot was reasonably faithful to canon, the production values were first rate, it was just ...... missing. Connelly wasn't quite vampy enough (I know, I know, they wanted to tone Betty's plain porno inclinations down for the Disney crowd), and we know she can do that. Campbell wasn't quite strong jawed heroic enough, and we know he can do *that*. Perhaps it's just that the principals didn't bring their ""A"" games to this movie, because just a touch more energy and verve would have made this a classic.7/10, mostly for the production values.",The Rocketeer

101,the_bluesman,The Rocketeer rocks!,9,13 September 2016,"Despite being produced by Walt Disney Pictures, this is not really a movie for kids. It is actually quite violent for a Disney movie and primarily aimed at a male audience. Presumably, the Disney tag was one of the reasons why the movie failed to become a box office success back in 1991 as people mistook it for a kids' movie.'The Rocketeer' is far from that! In fact, it is a very entertaining and fun adventure movie reminiscent of the Indiana Jones trilogy with its Nazi themes, the television spin off 'The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones'—in which this movie's director, Joe Johnston, was involved, too—and also of the old James Bond movies from the 1960s and 1970s with their exaggeratedly quirky villains. Coincidentally or maybe intentionally, the movie's main villain is portrayed by Timothy Dalton, who took on the role of James Bond two times and is excellent here as the charming but fanatical antagonist.While the screenplay could have been better, the great actors and especially the fantastic, action-packed and visually striking finale make up for what the plot is lacking in direction. Joe Johnston is a capable director with a distinct style that is present in virtually all of the movies he has directed, including 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011), which is similar to this movie in a number of aspects.The cast of 'The Rocketeer' is simply superb and includes a number of very fine character actors and some big names, too. I mean, look at that excellent cast list: Alan Arkin, Paul Sorvino, Terry O'Quinn, Jon Polito, Ed Lauter, William Sanderson, Margo Martindale... These actors have been in like every movie ever made! Billy Campbell is decent in the lead role, even though he is not the greatest actor around, but he carries this movie quite well. It makes you wonder why his film career never really took off afterward. He is familiar of course, mostly from television, but he is not a big name.

Timothy dalton is kinda of going for his role in Flash Gordon as the bad guy neville Sinclair. I liked Peabody but his character comes across as a guilty Frankenstein.

The film starts off with Cliff test flying a new plane that he is going to enter in a national race. Do to no fault of his own the plane crash lands and is lost beyond repair destroying the fuel truck of the local business man. In order to pay for this debt Cliff agrees to fly another plane in the air show that this business man runs. When Cliff inspects this plane he finds a rocket pack in one of its seats. With the help of his friend Peevy (Alan Arkin) he learns to use this rocket pack to save someone's life. Meanwhile two different fractions are searching for this rocket pack. One group is the FBI and the other group is a bunch of mobsters that were hired by Neville Sinclair (Timothy Dalton), a Hollywood actor.Character DevelopmentCliff (Bill Campbell) learns what it takes to become a hero, but he doesn't have to do any soul searching to do it. He doesn't have to sacrifice anything or face any real trials and in the end he is pretty much the same guy he was at the start of the film. Jenny (Jennifer Connelly) does make a more noticeable change. She had stardust in her eyes at the beginning of the story, but by its conclusion she had a different perspective on Hollywood.ActingThe acting was really brilliant in this film. All the players reach high marks all the way down to the bottom of the cast. I particularly enjoyed Bob Leeman's role of W.C. Fields. The acting is on the pinnacle of any current comic book hero movie that you may choose to see, with all the black and white bad guys and heroics and colorful characters you can ask for. There are mobsters with hearts of gold, greedy nickel nursing business men, historical figures, intrepid FBI agents, and a bunch of cartoon Nazis to shot at. This is art mirroring art; Hollywood's looking back onto itself circa 1940.OverviewThis picture could have been made into a sequel. It had all the right ingredients and there was even a seed at the end that hinted that this could be a possibility. Yet I believe the talk was that this picture went over budget and the studio didn't get a good return on their investment so a sequel wasn't in the cards. Still there should have been one. This was movie magic. It had the feel of no other comic book hero movie. Like Batman the Rocketeer didn't have any super natural powers. He could fly, but only because he was wearing a rocket pack, only this was not like any recent Batman film. There was a certain ease and finesse here that didn't go overboard in the telling of it.

The rocket man character itself feels like a rip off of iron man or some other super hero of the time. This feels like a Disney movie, actually like a Disney skit you would see at one of the parks. This movie would have been a sensation in a different time. It is 35 years too late. The pace is just boring and feels much longer than it is. Indiana Jones, while having a similar cheeky delivery, executes comedy and suspense in a way that makes it feel like it's in another dimension if compared to this movie as an example.

Funny in-jokes: the Erroll Flynn doppelganger villain is really a Nazi spy, as Flynn was at one time suspected of; the appearance of a Mondo Hatton look-alike, a monster-ish bad guy with a frightening face; Howard Hughes seeing a model for his Spruce Goose actually fly; the Erroll Flynn villain commenting that he ""does his own stunts,"" as Flynn often did.

106,ad2020,"Good, but I wasn't a real fan.",7,12 March 2001,"I saw this movie in Aerospace class almost 10 years ago,(memories....) and I remember not being too impressed w/ it, but it was OK all the same, even though it was hard to tell us gutter children why the lead character is such pansy and why he don't just give his womyn good lovin'. I provided the answer,(Satan himself)Disney!!!!(Personally, she should've gone w/ Timothy Dalton, provided she didn't know he was a Nazi) I still it found it to be interesting, you've got more than one plot going on w/ an interesting array of characters(which overshadowed the cheesy stereotype-casting, like I said, I'm not a fan.) I also learned that they used real Nazi footage for the scenes that were projected and that we really did almost figure out how to get rocket-packs that could actually harness it's user from certain death (that is, if you can keep it from bursting vs. the power to be actually airborne vs. the ability of the user to fly acrobatically w/out breaking their neck, etc.) I'll give it a 7, hey does anybody notice that these movies don't point out why Nazi's are bad, assuming you didn't know (they didn't back in the 40's), irony and non-fandom are something you should take to this movie.",The Rocketeer
107,marcusman48,This rocket fizzles out....,4,15 January 2008,"You couldn't blame Disney, really. After all, they'd struck gold - and then some - with WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and DICK TRACY. Like THE ROCKETEER, those two films had also been lightweight, glossy adventures set roughly during the World War II era. Who's to say that anyone might possibly have suspected that lightning wouldn't necessarily strike a third time? (Then again, we've all heard the expression about three strikes and an out.) I was ten years old on that summer day when my little sister and I were taken to see this. I had no inkling at the time that it had been based on a comic book, but I didn't care; I didn't read comic books then. All I knew was that it had been produced by Disney (a sure-fire name brand for reeling in kids like my sister and myself) and that it was set in midcentury America (a time and place that I had always regarded as colorful and lively) in my mother's hometown of Los Angeles. I didn't expect a masterpiece....but then I didn't expect to be left cold, either.I think my greatest problem was with the actors who played the hero and heroine: Bill Campbell and Jennifer Connelly. Campbell had very little charisma; and Connelly....well, she might as well have been a very lifelike robot. They were so boring that I found myself rooting for Timothy Dalton's suave and sinister bad guy. If your film's protagonists inspire nothing but apathy from the get-go, you're already in serious trouble.The plot was so superficial and generic that it could indeed have been plucked from a 1930s Saturday matinée serial. The concept of a Nazi takeover of America using Howard Hughes's jet-pack device seemed like an afterthought. Why were there even Nazis in this, other than that a posse of well-dressed Mafiosi (led by Paul Sorvino) didn't exactly present a credible menace? The answer, of course, is that you can inject Nazis into anything and the plot will automatically become sexier. There's really nothing wrong with this (the INDIANA JONES films and Disney's own BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS had also served up Nazis for a family audience); the problem here is that, unlike in other films, here Nazism seems more like a spice rather than an essential ingredient. Even worse, we are never offered any justification for why a wealthy and personable actor like Neville Sinclair would ever be attracted to Nazi ideology.For a supposed action film, THE ROCKETEER features precious little action and spends way too much time on plot exposition during the first half of the movie. The romantic subplot could have been totally written out, as well as the aforementioned Nazi element. Kids like movies with stories in them, but not if those stories are overly convoluted. At the end of the day, we just want to see a guy in a rocket suit beating up villains.(On a side note: Why would Germany be sending a passenger zeppelin around the world in 1938 - a full year after the Hindenburg disaster?) Is there anything at all good about THE ROCKETEER? Sure, there are many things: good dialogue, good music, good special effects, and (in the case of a mob goon named Lothar who looks like he could have made a cameo in DICK TRACY) excellent makeup. But none of these things can ever truly save a movie whose story is weak and whose characters (except for Sinclair) are indeed as paper-thin as the comic-book creations that inspired them.",The Rocketeer

111,donahue-1,Typical Disney Movie,4,21 May 2015,Typical Disney Fluff. If you are a Disney Fan - go for it. I - however - would much rather watch King of the Rocket Men (1949) - because despite all of these years I still find it enjoyable. Special Effects - Nazi Zeppelins and Exploding Rocket Packs - don't always make for a superior movie. The plot was not too technical - because - I suspect that if one were to use one's head as a rudder - (rudder built into helmet) - while zooming along at 100 miles an hour - one would snap one's head off. But - it is what it is and probably would be a nice film for kids. The acting was understandably restrained with the actors holding back - probably due to its PG-13 rating. A nice family film - but - give King of the Rocket Men a try some rainy Saturday Afternoon.,The Rocketeer
112,JudgeChaos,Seriously Under Rated!,9,5 May 2015,"After I saw the Nostalgia Critic's ""Top 11 Under Rated Nostalgic Movies"", I decided I should give this movie a shot, and he was absolutely right! It's a very fun story, with memorable characters, and a few dated effects. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, and I was actually worried when the characters were in danger. The only problem I think is that, although the movie is called ""the Rocketeer"", he doesn't show up that much in the movie. It's like going to see a ""Spider-Man"" movie, but Peter Parker only puts on the costume two or three times. I don't really have a problem with that, because the few scenes he is in are really action packed and fun! If you love World War II movies or super hero films, definitely check this movie out.",The Rocketeer
113,JARA-3,"Fun, but not good",6,17 August 1999,"The Rocketeer captures the look of the 30's serials wonderfully, and the feel, too.... unfortunately.  Most of those old stories were powered by expository dialogue and a couple of snappy stunts --  no real story, no real characters, and that's the problem here.  A story almost happens, when Terry O'Quinn emerges as Howard Hughes, but instead we are carried through a series of cliches and near misses that leave you smiling and intrigued, but never breathless and thrilled.  I like this movie, largely because of the cast and my fond remembrances of the comic book, but I fear it falls well short of its promise.  It remains a tribute to the 30's instead of trying to fulfil the period's fondest wishes.",The Rocketeer

I've watched it over two dozen times and still am not tired of it. And one of the very few films where James Horner did not spread his music over the whole thing like plaster, instead delivering a score that from the very first sequence enters your ear and never leaves it anymore. Delicious the characterization even of the very small roles (eg W.C. Fields in the second act). Timothy Dalton delivers a wonderfully ""naughty and Nazi"" bad guy in one of his best performances. Jenny Connelly is just delicious, Arkin the quintessential engineer-genius, LOST's Terry O'Quinn plays a charismatic Howard Hughes, and Bill Campbell a believable hero. Beautiful the overall irony about Hollywood of the thirties (bit not only). A small masterpiece of popcorn cinema, a good alternative to the Spielberg-Lucas way of doing it. Pure entertainment at its very very best, really.",The Rocketeer
117,toronaga,Sure holds up well,9,24 October 2008,"I never saw this in theaters which I understand was pretty much what happened to it when it first debuted. I discovered it later as a rental. I loved it then and still love it now years later. I guess since it is a deliberate retro it can't really get dated like other movies.I had no real problems with any of the acting jobs, each actor filled the role he/she played well. I always wondered why Bill Campbell didn't seem to go much further after this? Fun to see Terry O'Quinn as Howard Hughes before his ""Lost"" years.This movie makes you feel good. An unpretentious and straightforward action flick, one of the best in that category. It is so amazing how movies like this can be made without needing overwhelming effects, big-name stars, sexual suggestions, or gore. I wish Hollywood could do this more often (and who would've expected this from Disney? - not any more).The soundtrack main theme was wonderful as well, I think I've even heard it in some other movie (not sure how that could've happened).

118,dentonsfarm,Into the Wild Blue Yonder,8,13 April 2004,"This movie has the tendency to fly off the screen at you, especially if you saw it on the big screen like I did. I was 9 years old when the Rocketeer came out, and after seeing it I couldn't help but day dream about flying, and winning over the girl. Of course I tended to have the same day dreams after watching Superman the movie. But this film is a little different. It seemed more believable to me, as a kid, in that it incorporated some semi historical facts with the story line. I believe it to be one of Disney's finnest films, perhaps a modern epic. It's one of those films you've got to watch at least once a year. However I do have a question concerning it, ""How did the Rocketeer manage with all those flames blasting at his ass?""",The Rocketeer
119,ItsRobSummers,Perfection,9,7 December 2020,"In college, eons ago. My brother had this demanding, brilliant, literature professor who had The Rocketeer poster in his office. This was pre X-Men 1. And he said this was the only comic book adaptation that nailed it. It just got the true spirit of it's origin.There have prob been a few great comic adaptations since then ( and maybe before too. SUPERMAN THE MOVIE, any one?) but I don't know if there is one that's better. The Rocketeer captures and I may even argue improves on the source material. Which is saying something. Cause I own pretty much every iteration of the original funny book run.Maybe one of the most perfectly cast films of all time. Every one is spot on. And the cast plays their parts without camp but still in a wonderful ""comic book come to life"" tone.Campbell - he's Harrison Ford Indy perfect as the hero in over his head. Hard to believe he didn't go on to bigger things.Connelly - brings more than her considerable looks, she plays the sweet but plucky heroine and shines in the many vulnerable moments. Can do the funny too. Kinda totally smitten with her. Hard not to be.Arkin - the best. I'm starting to think this guy can do anything. Just pretty much gets every moment dead on.Dalton - may never have been better in anything. A great bad guy created for the movie. He is having a ball. And it shows.O' Quinn - his Howard Hughes is a gas.Some effects are slightly dated but so many use terrific mix with practical stunts and any green screen stuff is utilized with a flair for composition and staging so it really doesnt matter. It delivers the moment it's supposed to.Johnston and screenwriters really got it. The crackerjack script is fast paced, light and fun but has characters we care about and root for. And Johnston has a real eye and feel for the world of the film. Every set and prop and costume is so awesome. No surprise considering he designed Star Wars and Raiders. Perfect fit for the material.Yeah. I love this movie. I could just go on and on.BTW The blu ray is aces on audio/visuals. No extras tho.",The Rocketeer

Full of anticipation, the movie suggests a country and its people on the verge of greatness--the same story of our country retold many times. Rocketeer and pioneer--synonymous with the excitement of an unfolding adventure and, in this case, filled with the daily customs and familiarities of those who were either the protagonists or their witnesses. Powerful components dazzle the viewer:  melodic, brassy and triumphant music; luscious photography one could almost taste; comic book sets more intimate and more grand than real life; action-packed direction to beat the second hand; and a near-perfect cast (imagine actors other than Bill Campbell and Alan Arkin) for one of the ultimate feel good movies.Admittedly, the Dave Stevens graphic novel offered more gristle, stronger counterpoint and puzzles to titillate, but it had to pass the Disney taste test to be allowed to emerge as a full blown movie--and at Disney everything must be sweet.

123,hbenthow,"Great fun, and a masterpiece of its genre.",10,25 April 2010,"""The Rocketeer"" is easily one of my favorite adventure movies. For me, it is one of the most enjoyable movies of all time, a magical experience. In my opinion, it rivals the Indiana Jones movies. The actors all did a terrific job. They gave one of the most accurate modern portrayals of people from the 1930s I have seen in years. This movie got the mannerisms, speech, and slang of the 1930s exactly right. It is one of the few that has the characters speaking exactly the way they would in the 1930s. That in itself is a feat of scriptwriting and acting.Cliff Secord is a very likable character. He is pretty much your average Joe, the type of guy you see every day. The villain, Neville Sinclair is brilliantly portrayed by Timothy Dalton.The plot, well is quite simple, as were the plots of the serials it is inspired by.The music is just plain terrific. The score is one of the most magical I have ever heard. This was back in the day when James Horner was still among the greatest composers around. Don't expect a huge, action-packed extravaganza. In 1991, CGI was just starting out, and ""The Rocketeer"" contains none. All of the effects are achieved with old-fashioned methods, such as stop-motion.Overall, ""The Rocketeer"" is one of the most faithful modern imitations of a 1930s movie. It captures the spirit perfectly, and takes the sources it pays homage to seriously (but not too seriously).",The Rocketeer
124,jordans51,Far superior to most action movies of its type.,9,4 October 2003,"It is difficult for me to understand why this movie is not rated more highly by critics and viewers.  It is an excellent action film, with attractive and likable protagonists confronted by some first class villains.  The plot is logical, it flows smoothly, and the final resolution is entirely satisfying. The photography and special effects are first class. Perhaps part of the reason for this movie's rather poor showing has to do with its title and the way it was marketed.  I really don't know. At any rate, I think ""The Rocketeer"" is far superior to most action movies of its type, including those which were commercially successful like ""Spiderman"" and the Indiana Jones series.",The Rocketeer

Unlike ""The Shadow,"" this is well-balanced, engaging storytelling. The direction is crisp, the art design is particularly lush. This movie conjures an idealized 1930s, and the appeal of that world is half of what I love about these movies, and movies from that time period. I grew up watching this movie, and loved it as a kid.

It's so classic. Guy loves girl, loses girl, finds ""special power,"" girl meets bad guy, guy beats bad guy and reclaims girl. HHmmm..Sounds like a lot of movies. It's how they're executed that stands them apart. And this one is truly one of those times. Although no globe winner or academy winner by no means, this film does excel in entertainment. Even watching it today, it looks and feels just as good as it did when I watched it on VHS. It's like taking a B-movie idea (yes I know it has comic origins) and making it an A grade film. And it was helped along by Disney, which is surprising in those days. Black Cauldron wasn't released for years because it was ""too violent."" This film, however, had a lot going for it that was not exactly Disney standard.Anyhow, if you're a fan of comic books or adventure, if you're looking for a film for the whole family or simply trying to escape the hardships of the world for a more simpler time and place, this one's for you.

As well as this, it has everything an action film should have, explosions, girls and Nazis, with Jennifer Connolly playing a role that decided my sexual preference. When it came out in cinemas it didn't make much money, but this would have been due to its release date falling on the same day as Terminator 2, a surefire problem you would have thought Disney would try to avoid. Had the film been released earlier, I firmly believe it would have been a much bigger Box Office success, (and then made into a trilogy), not only because of the spectacle of Jennifer Connolly's ample bosom, but also because of the quality of action, adventure and childish wonderment that the Rocketeer provides.",The Rocketeer

Since ""The Rocketeer"" first launched in 1991, it has proved itself to be a timeless adventure that continues to entertain to this day. Yet as high-flying and fun as the story is, it should have taken us much higher.""The Rocketeer"" was meant to be an ""Indiana Jones"" franchise for Disney. So why didn't it ever take off? It wasn't the acting. Paul Sorvino is the perfect gangster in any film. Alan Arkin makes a great sidekick. Jennifer Connelly is the girl-next-door love interest any guy would want to rescue. And let's not forget Timothy Dalton, who plays the Errol-Flynn-turned-villain with such sinister charm you can't imagine anyone else in the role. (Bonus: Look for a quick appearance by Jan from ""The Office"" as the singer in the club scene.)Sometimes the subplots get too much priority, the special effects don't blend well, and the score is definitely not as memorable as Indiana's. But these things can be overlooked if the storytelling is good, and ""The Rocketeer"" keeps things flying. It's an adventure, it's a caper, it's a romance, it's a period piece, it's patriotic, it's suspenseful -- so much more all packaged in a single film. It just about makes it as a super hero movie, too. The Rocketeer as a character has that unique and iconic look that makes kids want to dress up and fly around the living room. Even if you barely remember the movie, you still recognize the Rocketeer as a standout character all these years later.So why didn't this film do better than it did? The biggest weakness is the movie's lead. Billy Campbell was not the actor to carry a film like this. It really needed a Harrison-Ford-as-Indiana-Jones swashbuckler type, and Campbell didn't fit the bill. I know that director Joe Johnston fought for Campbell to be his lead, but I don't get what he saw in him. Campbell makes a good side character in ""Star Trek"" or ""Frasier"" (shows in which he appeared). God bless him, he's just not a marquee guy.The Rocketeer just didn't take us to heights it could have. If interest in the character remains high, maybe ""The Rocketeer"" will become more than a by-gone film of yester-year. He seems like the perfect vehicle (rocket?) for the new Disney Plus platform.

Very underrated, but 11 years after release, still a hoot to watch.",The Rocketeer
142,femwolf,Pure fun,10,7 October 2005,"This movie fast became a winner in this household - one-liners abound and the hero is the type I remember from my own childhood. Situated a bit before the Indiana Jones era, it has some (though perhaps not all) of the wonder of taking you back instead of forward to find elements of both sci-fi and nostalgia. There is nothing stale in the presentation - this came across as a new concept even though it was set in the past. Pure fun for all, a good family movie where the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad, and we certainly know that the hero by risking life and limb will win. Even so, it doesn't take away from the surprises. Enjoy!",The Rocketeer
143,Toby-8,How fantasy thrillers should be made,9,22 June 2001,"Talented actors who care more about performance than their own star power, charming characters, an insidiously evil bad guy with an unnerving henchman, and a plot that screams excitement, this is a stunning and somewhat forgotten example of how to make a great blockbuster. Why it wasn't as big as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a mystery and a tragedy...",The Rocketeer
144,LadyBrooke,I have to comment on this movie... It's among my all-time favorites,10,15 April 2001,"Of all the movies I've seen over the years, this movie stands out in a class of its own. It's a sweet mix of adventure, romance, drama and delightful humor. And the flying scenes! Hold onto your seat, sit back, and enjoy the ride.This is a movie where you're not really sure how it will all turn out, but you'll have fun on the way.  The hero is a likeable, ordinary guy, who must save the day, and the stakes are high if he doesn't.The music is intense, the backdrop is elegant, and every scene is strikingly vivid. While the setting is in the thirties, it doesn't have that ""way back then"" feel. In fact, it feels timeless.I highly recommend this movie to anyone! I wish there were more movies like it.",The Rocketeer
145,bdhsd,"Classic, simple and fun",9,6 April 2020,"This is such a good film! It's well written and cast. I'm glad it was made a while ago, because if it were made today I'm afraid it would have crude language and humor that's unnecessary. This has some of the best entertaining, escapism I've seen.",The Rocketeer
146,whatwouldscoobydoo,incredible!,10,2 September 2005,"how how how could anyone not enjoy this film? First off, Bill Campbell, 14 years ago :) plus it is actually really funny, through the action there are comedy moments too: ""biiiiig gopher!"" it shows the darker side of Hollywood (oooh that smarmy git, Neville Sinclair!) and it has a cheesy ending! and it's anti-Nazi I can't say I've ever been called ""pro-American"" but a Nazi is not what I am.but I'm not here to discuss politics, I'm talking about an awesome film ooh, romance, and friendship, and a huge big ugly guy (please tell me his face wasn't real?) and action...PLUS 1991 was, as it happens a very good year! if you are stupid you will put a bad review up here!",The Rocketeer
147,daveruyle,Criminally underrated,9,25 May 2021,"While I do believe this movie might've been better with a longer run time and some more pg-13 material, the pace of the movie is great, and has a lot of action and suspense none the less. 1991 was a VERY gritty and dark time period for movies and this movie was just too clean and ""all American feel good"" for the time, and I believe had it come out in 2001 instead, this movie might have done much better in the box office. I understand some more hard nosed (blow hard) critics might not resonate with movies that are simply made to make you feel good but don't let that stop you from checking out this hidden gem.",The Rocketeer
148,marksciberras,"Fun, fast but sadly forgotten.",10,9 August 2006,"Based on the Dave Steven's 1980s comic book series of the same name, the Rocketeer is one of the first comic book to film cross overs whose director (Joe Johnston of Jumanji) made a serious effort to stick as closely to the source material as possible. Despite a few alterations to the over all story, such as the Risqué Bettie Page character from the comics being replaced with the much more repectable ""girl next door"" Jenny Blake, the film very rarely strayed for the main ideas presented in the comic book.The film was pitched to audiences as Indianna Jones meets Top Gun, but in fact the Rocketeer was actually an update and homage to the popular 1950's pulp movie serial Commando Cody.The film was released in June, 1991, and grossed just under $50,000.00 in the US despite some very positive critical buzz. The film was one of Disney's major financial flops and quickly slipped into obscurity.However as with many films of this genre the movie has built up a cult following both stateside and in Japan, were even to this day a major toy manufacturer (Medicom) continues to produce 12"" action figures and replica helmets based on the film.The films cult status is well deserved, and is one of the most under-rated action films of the 1990's. The script, the actors and even the action were all top notch and exuded a sense of charm that has been somewhat lacking in the last decades barrage of summer popcorn flicks. There was a true sense of that old ""Gee Whiz"" feeling that was so key to the serial films of the 30's 40's and 50's. Billy Campbell, who like the film has slide into a level obscurity, fully embodied the all American fly boy image that America was trying to establish at the time. Billy was able to walk that same fine line between awkward geek and hero that Christopher Reeves did in Superman. Alan Arkin made the fatherly role of mechanic Peevey his own. Jennifer Connoly struck the perfect chord as the girlfriend who feels distanced and shut out from her boyfrieds life and is always on the defensive regarding her career choice to be an actress.This is also one of the most memorable roles for Timothy Dalton whose much maligned jaunt as James Bond never allowed him to show the kind of acting range he displays here. As a villain Dalton was spot on.Yes there are clichés, Nazi's once again are the villains. Yes there are mechanics in the film that are questionable, the Rocket pack shoots out flames that should set Cliff Secords pants on fire. But it's all very tongue in cheek and if you can see past the few flaws then the film is one hell of a ride.This is also one of the last big budget films to use practical effects. The film was released in the same month and year as Terminator 2 which used heavy CGI to accomplish many of its action scenes and is considered by many to have begun the CG revolution. There are directors such as Jon Favreau that have argued for a return to practical effects due to the over saturation of computer Graphics in modern sci fi and action films, and looking at the Rocketeer it's easy to understand why some directors are beginning to rebel against the use of CG. The effects in the Rocketeer have a certain charm and magic that would have been lost with the cold and sterile feel that computer renders tend to exhibit in these kind of films.",The Rocketeer
149,Raygun82,I grew up with this movie.,10,2 June 2006,"How can anybody give this a low rating? I remember going to the movies with my dad to see this, and at the age of 9 I thought it was outstanding! Let alone today when I watch it the special effects are still second to none for '91, this is truly a great movie. The story and plot are terrific, let alone the acting. Out of nowhere comes Billy Campbell which hits the mark on the spot, I cant see anybody else playing this part but him. The supporting cast is awesome as well. I really believe Joe Johnston hits the mark with the nostalgic look of the 1930's, the set designs are miraculous and really put you into the feel of an older time era. So with everybody's help maybe we could raise the ratings on this classic. LONG LIVE THE ROCKETEER!!!!!",The Rocketeer
