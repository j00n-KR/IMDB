0,SnoopyStyle,Paul Hackett annoys me,4,24 May 2016,"Meek office worker Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) encounters Marcy Franklin (Rosanna Arquette) at a coffee shop. She tells him that she's staying with sculptress Kiki Bridges (Linda Fiorentino) at a SOHO loft. Later that night, he goes to meet her. She reveals much from her life and he runs out on her. It's a long night struggle to get home.Martin Scorsese does a lot to make this interesting. He makes this a cinematic experience. There are fascinating characters. However, I really don't like the protagonist Paul. There is no accounting for Marcy's tastes. It's partly how Griffin Dunne plays him but mostly it's how he's written. There is something squirrelly about the guy. He lies when he doesn't have to. He's guarded. He's sneaky. He's whiny. He's bitter. It's not fun to be with this guy. I simply don't like him and it's hard to care about what happens to him.",After Hours
1,Hitchcoc,Nightmare in Soho,10,19 April 2021,"I had never heard of this dark comedy, directed by Martin Scorsese. Griffin Dunne, lonely and depressed, meets a rather scatterbrained but very pretty girl in a coffee shop. She gives him her number and this leads to a nightmare evening where Dunne's character, Paul, hits the waves of a violent sea that drives him back and forth. He only has a few bucks and loses it. This is only the start of his problems where he ends up literally running for his life. But each encounter brings with it hope and then defeat. We have some 1980's stalwarts, including Teri Garr and Catherine O'Hara (yes, from Schitt's Creek), and John Heard. Don't miss this. It's a masterpiece.",After Hours
2,mark.waltz,Welcome to So Ho...NOT!,7,28 May 2013,"A rather geeky young professor (Griffin Dunne) meets, by chance, a young lady (Rosanna Arquette), in a diner, gets her phone number, and later meets her in her Spring Street Apartment for a night he obviously won't forget, no matter how hard he tries. The lives of the people in this trendy but eccentric Manhattan neighborhood surround an artistic flare that reveals their offbeat personalities, some of them not so flattering. The all-night attempt to escape from this nightmare consists of suicide, robbery, plaster bagels and an ice cream truck which still annoyingly plays the same redundant tune over and over 30 years later.In the course of 90 minutes, the unlucky hero finds himself loosing $20 (flying out of a speeding cab window), finding out that his beautiful date is a neurotic, makes the dominatrix roommate accidentally fall asleep while giving her a seductive massage, finds himself short on change during a sudden rain downpour to pay the newly raised train fare, floods the bathroom of a trusting bartender, and ends up with a vigilante group on his hands who believe him to be a serial apartment thief. And that doesn't even top it, his attempted escape from this so bizarrely artistic that he ends up feeling like Frankenstein's monster.This is a who's who of cult actors from Teri Garr as a bee-hived bar waitress with definite self-hatred issues, John Heard as the overwhelmed bartender, Catherine O'Hara as a perky ice cream truck vendor who suddenly turns into Rambo. Arquette, as a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown whom Dunne heads downtown to meet, dominates the first quarter of the film. If you thought that Sandy Dennis and Jack Lemmon had issues in Manhattan as ""The Out of Towners"", these freaks will have you laughing in irony (considering their victim is a native), and a walk down these overly compact and crowded So Ho streets will make you question why people live here in this trendy but overpriced youth obsessed neighborhood that sometimes seems surrealistic and out of step with the rest of the Big Apple.",After Hours
3,claudio_carvalho,Surrealistic Adventure in Soho After Hours,9,11 October 2004,"While reading the Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer in a coffee shop, the bored word processor Paul Hackett (Griffe Dunne) meets Marcy Franklin (Rosanna Arquette), and she gives her phone number to him. Close to midnight, Paul decides to call her and she invites him to visit her in the loft of her friend, the sculptor Kiki Bridges (Linda Fiorentino), in Soho. Paul gets a taxi and loses his money through the open window of the cab. Paul arrives in Kiki's place, where begins his surrealistic adventure along the night. I do not know how many times I have seen this movie along my life, maybe ten times, but it still attracts me and now I have just seen it for the first time on DVD. I love it and it is one of my favorite cult movies. The surrealistic 'saga' of Paul Hackett trapped in Soho without means to return home is fantastic and fascinate me. The cast, direction, soundtrack and camera are excellent. I believe it is the best role and performance of Griffin Dunne in his career. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'Depois de Horas' ('After Hours (literally)')",After Hours
4,kosmasp,Before Dawn,7,22 April 2021,"I have been known to be nice to movies ... I've also been known (at least to myself), that I have issues with characters or choices that I am not comfortable with or think the movie went wrong in certain places. Now our main character here is not the most likeable. And that is something that really makes it hard to feel for him at certain stages, which is something that dampens the movie and its impact quite a bit.If that does not bother you as much, you can easily add another point to my initial rating - or maybe two. I am quite sure I had seen the movie before, but I did't remember it at all. Seen or not I remember seeing the video tape at video stores ... I reckon I have aged myself. Or alienated those not familiar with the terms/words I just used. Whatever the case, if anyone feels that way, wait til they see a movie where the main character is not able to use a cell phone or internet ... I know, shocking! But true as this movie is able to show us.The movie is well done, which is no surprise considering Scorsese did it. Great cast and suspense from start to finish.",After Hours
5,gavin6942,A Forgotten Scorsese,7,3 August 2015,"An ordinary word processor (Griffin Dunne) has the worst night of his life after he agrees to visit a girl (Rosanna Arquette) in Soho whom he met that evening at a coffee shop.At this point (2015), i think I have seen everything that Martin Scorsese directed. His epic gangster films, his low budget stuff like ""Boxcar Bertha"". This is probably one of the lesser-known ones in his catalog, right alongside ""King of Comedy"". Not that it is a bad film, because it is not. It is highly entertaining and won some awards... but yet, it seems to have faded away, much like its star (Dunne).Seek this one out, as it will show a very different Scorsese than what we now expect from him. Part romance, part misadventure, this is a pretty good tale of New York after midnight.",After Hours
6,lee_eisenberg,"the truth is, you really do get a feeling for the city during the night",8,22 April 2006,"While most of us may think that Martin Scorsese can only direct serious movies, here he directs a comedy. It portrays a man (Griffin Dunne) going through a series of weird adventures one night in New York. Whatever you can imagine, it probably happens here.I think that there's something else here. We humans have it as our nature to stay up during the day and sleep at night. Watching ""After Hours"", you really get the feeling - which may or may not be accurate - that you have to stay up all night to really get the feeling for a city sometimes (I'm not encouraging this, as some people may develop health problems if they stay up all night). This is probably especially true in New York.Anyway, this is a really funny movie. Dunne is as neat here as he was in ""An American Werewolf in London"". Also starring Rosanna Arquette, Verna Bloom (that's right: Marion Wormer from ""Animal House""), Tommy Chong, Linda Fiorentino, Teri Garr, John Heard, Cheech Marin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Miller, Will Patton and Bronson Pinchot.",After Hours
7,Woodyanders,Martin Scorsese's brilliantly quirky and startling black comedy treat,9,15 February 2007,"Buttoned-down straight-arrow ordinary schmo word processor Paul Hackett (superbly played by Griffin Dunne) goes to SoHo for a date with Marcy (an adorably daffy Rosanna Arquette), a flaky, but attractive young lass he recently met in a coffee shop. Paul's night out on the town turns out to be a major bummer of cosmic proportions: he loses his money during the cab ride en route to Marcy's apartment, the subway fare goes up so he can't take the train home, Marcy commits suicide, an angry mob mistakes him for a burglar who's been robbing the neighborhood, and he encounters a steady succession of hostile women who exacerbate the severity of his already dire situation. Director Martin Scorsese adeptly uses a bracing and bravura style to relate the engrossingly oddball story: the dizzying whiplash pans, quick snappy cuts, and dynamic camera movements expertly create a disorientingly off-kilter ""anything can happen"" urban ""Twilight Zone"" atmosphere that's both darkly funny and fiercely exhilarating in comparable measure. Moreover, Scorsese deftly maintains a ceaseless swift pace and effectively conjures up a playfully eccentric and unpredictable tone. Joseph Minion's deliciously droll and deadpan script offers a sensationally surreal and edgy existential meditation on fate and misfortune. The first-rate cast excel in their colorfully quirky roles: Linda Fiorentino as a cool, alluring sculptress, John Heard as a friendly bartender, Teri Garr as a wacky, neurotic cocktail waitress, Catherine O'Hara as a crazed, kooky ice cream vendor, Dick Miller as a nice guy diner waiter, Vic Argo as a grumpy diner cashier, Verna Bloom as a lonely middle-aged woman, and Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong as a pair of amiably blundering thieves. Howard Shore's moody, neatly percolating score and Michael Ballhaus' strikingly sharp, slick and handsome cinematography are both exceptional. A terrifically outré, inspired and original one-of-a-kind treat.",After Hours
8,ccthemovieman-1,After The Shock Wears Off........,6,20 November 2006,"Wow, this is another strange movie. Maybe ""bizarre"" are even ""weird"" would be better descriptions. Since it's a favorite of national critics, you know it's not a movie that most normal people are going to like.I watched this movie twice, and found it to be one of those films that is very interesting the first time around, but tiresome and almost stupid on the second look. Some movies are like that, mainly the ones which are wacky and the viewer is shocked at what he's seeing. When the shock wears off, it isn't so entertaining. That was case here. On the first look, it kept my attention because I was wondering what crazy thing was going to happen next. It's hard to explain this film because its a combination of genres and an attempt at black humor. I say ""attempt"" because on the second viewing, I didn't find it very funny. Be warned, too, on the first viewing: the first 25 minutes are slow, and then it picks up, so stick with it.",After Hours
9,moonspinner55,"Agonizing or brilliant, ""After Hours"" doesn't leave much middle ground...",5,19 September 2006,"Director Martin Scorsese doing coldly-cutting comedy--sort of like a prankster with a joy-buzzer that really zaps you. The effect is both rude and sadistic...yet some may find irony in this low-ball humor. Luckless Griffin Dunne chances to meet cute flake Rosanna Arquette one night in New York City, but a follow-up date is fraught with calamities, and characters apparently just sprung from a nuthouse. The attractive supporting performers (including Teri Garr, Linda Fiorentino, John Heard, Thomas Chong and Cheech Marin) are not used to balance out the craziness in the material with their star-personas; everyone on-screen is just a little bit battier than the ones who came before, and once you've become attuned to the movie's intentionally-bumpy rhythm (the cinematic equivalent of Bumper Cars), the rest of the picture can be a very funny lark. However, with so many ciphers on display, and absolutely no mercy shown from our director, I was too aware of the material as ""gag comedy"". It's never less than well-done, and has an amazing full-circle finish, but there's nothing substantial about ""After Hours"". All the requisite Scorsese style is wasted, really, on piffle. ** from ****",After Hours
10,blanche-2,When You See a Mister Softee Truck - RUN!,10,23 August 2010,"""After Hours"" is one of the great comedies of the '80s and alas, there are too few of these films made today. Directed by, of all people, Martin Scorcese, it's the story of a young word processor, Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) who decides to go to Soho one evening rather than sit in his New York City apartment. He soon regrets his decision, as he becomes involved in a death, accused of robbery, chased throughout Soho, and takes part in an art installation.While most people will never have a night like this, many people can relate to days in their youth where a night turned into a nightmare or the world's longest journey. Most of the humor in ""After Hours"" comes from the characters that inhabit this particular night, played by some wonderful performers - Roseanne Arquette as Marcy, a complete looney tune who is staying in the loft of a sculptor (Linda Fiorentino) into S&M; Terri Garr as Julie, a waitress stuck in the '60s who hits on Paul; John Heard as a bartender who offers to give Paul subway fare, but fate intervenes; Catherine O'Hara as Gail, who sells Mister Softee and then leads a vigilante group against Paul in her truck; and June, who shall we say, incorporates Paul into her work. Paul has other encounters, but those are the main ones.Cheech Marin are hilarious as apartment robbers, as is Robert Plunket as a gay guy who brings Paul to his apartment. There's also an angry cab driver and a bouncer from hell.An extremely clever, original script, excellent direction, and the guilelessness of Griffin Dunne are the overarching stars of ""After Hours."" A no-miss.",After Hours
11,Quinoa1984,Scorsese in comedy,10,13 July 2000,"Martin Scorsese has 2 comedies on his movie list- The King of Comedy and After Hours.  While the first dealt with a small time stand up guy trying to get a Jerry Lewis type of big shot, this film is quite different.  Here, a regular yuppie is stuck in a bad section of the city, where Cheech and Chong (probably the best reason to see this film besides Scorsese is C & C) have a truck with a sculpture, a guy has 8 robberies in one house in one week and the yuppie is fodder for scum in the night.  And it is funny.  Scorsese depicts this guy's odyssey to get home in a good fashion (even if comedy isn't exactly Marty's genre), not too bright, yet not too dark either.  One of the best films of 1985.  A",After Hours
12,Theo Robertson,Scorsese's Least Impressive Movie,4,26 February 2005,"I once remembered seeing a movie featuring the actor who played the ghost from American Werewolf In London , a couple of leather boys snogging in a diner and production standards that belonged in a TV movie . I can't remember why I hated it but I sure did remember hating it . Anyway I flicked through the TV guide wondering what was on and saw that there was a black comedy from Martin Scorsese that was given four stars . Hey Scorsese I'm not going to miss this . so I switched over the channel to watch AFTER HOURS and within a few minutes I realised that this was the movie I hated from all those years ago Okay I agree that this is a quirky film . However it's also a deeply unsatisfying one that wouldn't get half as much acclaim if the directing credits read "" Alan Smithee "" . Paul goes on a date , so far so good but after that the story degenerates into an episodic tale hinging on some quite unbelievable coincidences . You might have to suspend disbelief watching the BBC comedy classic ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE , another comedy where the humour revolves around coincidence but not too much , and at least ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE is genuinely funny , alas AFTER HOURS soon loses all credibility , and I'm sorry to point out that it's far from being an amusing film . Try not to lynch me for saying this but it looks like it was directed by someone who has just left film school ten minutes ago Along with BRINGING OUT THE DEAD this is Martin Scorsese's least impressive movie",After Hours
13,Hey_Sweden,Different rules apply when it's After Hours.,8,3 September 2012,"Martin Scorsese's ""After Hours"" is an overlooked film on his resume, a refreshingly unpredictable dark comedy where one won't be able to tell where it's headed from scene to scene. Credit is due to a fine cast and crew that keep things tense and interesting throughout; these 97 minutes practically fly by. Likable Griffin Dunne plays Paul Hackett, a mild mannered word processor who lives to regret his decision to follow up on his attraction to Marcy (Rosanna Arquette), a fellow coffee shop customer. He's been looking for some adventure in his life, but comes to learn that sometimes people should be careful what they wish for. He comes to visit Marcy where's she staying in an artists' (Linda Fiorentino) loft in Soho, and on the way loses a $20 bill. This is just the start of the series of negative developments during the course of the night. Soon, all the harried and haggard Paul wants to do is to get home and get some sleep. ""After Hours"" is endlessly amusing for the parade of characters whom Paul meets, and they range from kooky yet endearing, like Marcy, to out and out nutty. A top notch cast does well with the material: John Heard, Teri Garr, Catherine O'Hara, Will Patton, Verna Bloom, and Cheech & Chong are just some of the people that turn up (there are also small roles for the likes of Dick Miller and Bronson Pinchot). By its very nature, the screenplay by Joseph Minion has a somewhat episodic nature, but these episodes are each hysterical in their own twisted way. Paul is really not too sympathetic a character (if only he'd dealt with a hangup of his, things might have happened differently), but by the end you do sympathize with his plight, especially as a crazed vigilante mob relentlessly tracks him down, convinced that he's the burglar ripping off apartments in the neighbourhood. Scorsese and his excellent editor Thelma Schoonmaker keep this offbeat film moving along extremely well, rarely pausing to take a breather, and paint a picture of NYC at night that is incredibly weird and surreal. This is stylish at all times, as it works its way towards its resolution. Dunne and Amy Robinson are among the producers. Eight out of 10.",After Hours
14,grantss,There's a reason this is one of Scorsese's least-known movies...,5,14 May 2017,"Late one night, Paul Hackett meets a girl, Marcy, in a diner. She gives him her phone number and later that night he calls her. She invites him over to her place, which is across town. At her place things don't quite work out and Paul decides to go home. However, he has no money for cab or train fare and things are about to get very weird, leading to a situation where his life is in danger.One of Martin Scorsese's least-known movies, and there's a reason for that. It is not that good. It had potential, as a quirky comedy or an intense drama, but it's these very possibilities that doom it to failure. Instead of picking one of the two courses and sticking with it, Scorsese tries to have a bet each way, making it a quirky comedy with deadly serious thriller aspects to it too, and the two sides don't gel (how could they, possibly?). Difficult to view it seriously as a thriller, when you have these comedic moments. Difficult to laugh when the danger may be real. This conflict makes for an uneven experience.Not funny enough to be a good comedy (though there are some good moments), not intense enough to be a good drama. The comedy itself mostly revolves around trying to throw as many wacky characters and situations into the mix as possible, and this gets rather tiresome, rather quickly.The adventure that befalls Paul Hackett is quite a roller-coaster ride though, and it is this ceaseless momentum that prevents the movie from being total waste of time. Ending is quite poetic too.",After Hours
15,oscaralbert,To the unfortunate movie mavens of 1985 . . .,6,25 October 2017,". . . AFTER HOURS must have seemed like pure drivel. This tedious sequel to MEAN STREETS seems to drag on aimlessly for two or three times its length by the clock. If mentioned in the same breath with THE RAGING BULL or TAXI DRIVER, film students would bet their bottom wooden nickel that director Martin Scorsese had suffered a stroke or lobotomy (perhaps both!) prior to releasing AFTER HOURS. But it's said that Warner Bros. works in Mysterious Ways, and we now know that America's Extreme Early Warning System was actually focusing its far-sighted energies upon providing a cautionary AFTER HOURS tale for We Citizens of (The Then) Far Future. Serial woman-abusing snoop deadbeat ""Paul Hackett"" is NOT foretelling the upcoming misdeeds of Bill Cosby (too pale), Bill Clinton (too Northern), or Harvey Weinstein (too thin). No, it's clear that Manhattanite Paul--with his mangled hair-do, unwillingness to pay cab or subway fares, and misogynistic woman-hopping ways--represents none other than the Bane of Modern America, Manhattanite Don Juan Rump, as Rump was then, is now, and ever will be. The last third of AFTER HOURS is more of a personal warning to Master Rump himself, as a lynch mob of wised-up citizens pursues his stand-in Paul to deliver long overdue Justice!",After Hours
16,view_and_review,Long Sitcom With No Laugh Track,2,18 November 2019,"I suppose Scorcese's name meant this was supposed to be a good movie. He hates comic book movies but at least they're entertaining. This was a 97 minute sitcom without the laughs or the laugh track to let us know something funny happened.The main character met a girl, went to her house in SOHO, and the next thing he knows he's out of money and can't get home. After his miserable date all he wants to do is get home but one mishap after another keeps him hostage in the SOHO district all night.Like I said, it would have been better if it was at least funny because it wasn't all that creative.",After Hours
17,evanston_dad,An Uneasy Scorsese Experiment,6,18 February 2008,"I tried very hard to like ""After Hours,"" Martin Scorsese's surrealist head trip about a straight-laced word processor (Griffin Dunne) who ventures off into the SoHo night and gets trapped inside a frustrating nightmare. It's an interesting premise for a film -- what goes on out there in the nocturnal world while the rest of us are fast asleep? But I couldn't help but feel that the film was trying too hard, like its creators were intentionally setting out to make something that would eventually end up as a cult classic. That it did doesn't make the movie any better. The best cult classics are those that become so naturally, not those that are manufactured to be so.Griffin Dunne is on screen nearly constantly, and he does well with his role, gradually working himself up to a nearly hysterical pitch of frustration in his failed attempts to get back to the safety of his home. The supporting cast is peopled with recognizable faces in cameos: Teri Garr, Catherine O'Hara, Cheech Marin, Rosanna Arquette. But no one is really playing a character, and no one really gets much to work with. I wasn't bothered by the implausibility of the film; implausibility is the film's point. But I did get somewhat bored by the arbitrary plot twists, and the fact that I couldn't connect with anyone in the film, not even Dunne, whose character is vaguely unlikable.I did like the film's ending, though. It nicely captures that feeling of waking from an unsettling dream into the familiar world that you know and recognize.Grade: B",After Hours

19,anaconda-40658,A Great Film to watch in Those After Hours.,9,5 November 2015,"After Hours (1985): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, John Heard, Linda Fiorentino, Teri Garr: Underrated Martin Scorsese dark comedy about that counter to normality that provides a nightmare. Griffin Dunne plays software programmer Paul Hackett who is bored with life. He meets Marcy Franklin, played by Rosanna Arquette and a chance encounter turns into a trip to Soho where everything that can go wrong does. Dunne plays off the irritable nature of Hackett who discovers a dead body, has his head nearly shaved, and is pursued by a mob who believe that he is robbing apartments. Arquette as Marcy is sexy and mysterious leaving Hackett with nervous sexual tension. John Heard plays a bartender who offers to financially assist Hackett when he is stranded without subway fare. It becomes bizarre when he ties in when he receives a phone call tying an overdosed female to himself. Linda Fiorentino plays Soho artist Kiki Bridges who is roommates with Marcy, and into BDSM relationships. Teri Garr plays a feisty waitress whose bed is surrounded by mouse traps. Scorsese fills the film with intriguing comedic characters thus throwing Hackett into awkward pearl that ends brilliantly where it all begins. Beautiful locations and a theme of normality and consequences of venturing outside the comfort zone in those after hours where anything can and will occur. Score: 9 / 10",After Hours
20,Mr-Fusion,A satisfying urban nightmare,8,23 March 2015,"""After Hours"" bristles with its own distinct energy, which is partially why I love this movie. Even the quiet scene are riding a caffeine buzz and that only ices a cake this absurd. It boasts a pretty great cast, each bringing their own brand of crazy to the table (Catherine O'Hara's my favorite, inciting a lynch mob in her Mister Softee truck). Watching this movies is like stumbling into someone's fevered dream. It's not just that Griffin Dunne can't get back home, but all of these ridiculous situations are bizarrely connected. If it ain't one thin, it's another with this movie. And just when you think there's nowhere left to go with this story, Scorsese flips the tables yet again (once more down the rabbit hole).It's madness, but thoroughly entertaining.8/10",After Hours

A Dark Comedy by Master Filmmaker Martin Scorsese, that offers shock value, some engaging moments, but, it's dark tone, will not attract everyone.'After Hours' Synopsis: An ordinary word processor has the worst night of his life after he agrees to visit a girl in Soho whom he met that evening at a coffee shop.This Dark-Comedy is meant for a certain audience. Scorsese's Direction is fantastic, while the writing material is fairly engaging & offers shock value. But, as said, the dark tone and the complicated narrative, will not attract everyone. You need to be in a certain mood to absorb a film like 'After Hours'. In my opinion, the film worked in bits. I truly feel the second-hour could've been better, and even shorter in terms of length. Cinematography & Editing are well-done. Performance-Wise: Griffin Dunne delivers a terrific performance. He beautifully executes and understands his character. Teri Garr, like always, is top-notch. Rosanna Arquette is impressive. Linda Fiorentino does exceedingly well. John Heard gets limited scope. Verna Bloom lends support.

Overrated and boring, the ""hero"" in this flick marches to the beat of the directors crop behaving uncharacteristically in order to make the film work. Getting four stars from Ebert while Maltin offers a lukewarm 2.5 stars, this film will probably appeal most to cinema junkies who are into weirdness for weirdness's sake.",After Hours
23,MovieAddict2016,Great slice of underrated (dark) film-making from a cinematic genius,9,28 February 2005,"I don't know why everyone thinks ""After Hours"" ends happily. This is a brooding, dark, bitter film, with a pessimistic outlook on life and a downright depressing core message. It is a ""comedy"" with no laughs, and few chuckles. It is also a great cult film by director Martin Scorsese that came and went in 1985 with little attention.It's surprising to see that Scorsese took on another comedy so shortly after his major flop, The King of Comedy (1983), starring Robert De Niro. Scorsese publicly acknowledged that he wished he had never made The King of Comedy and his star disowned it. It was a film so far ahead of its time, no one understood it  or much less, cared to see it.Thank goodness this did not dissuade Scorsese from making another comedy. He was back two years later with After Hours, which is an intense, hellish, nightmarish odyssey through New York City's Soho late at night, and into the morning. The film's protagonist, Paul (Griffin Dunne), is an unlikable character who generally gains sympathy with us only because of his grueling misfortunes. Fate, it seems, has a grudge against poor Paul; as the night progresses, it only becomes worse and worse, until he is running away from a bloodthirsty mob and happens to inadvertently witness a random murder. ""I'll probably get blamed for that,"" he says to himself, which is exactly what we're thinking.This really is the sort of film that makes you almost want to stop watching, it is so painful. Nothing at all goes right for Paul. When he seeks comfort in a friend, he is relieved, finally able to sit back and take a breath of air -- only to look outside and see his ""friend"" alerting the bloodthirsty mob.The plot  what little there is  begins in a typical daytime office setting. Paul meets a girl after a hard day at work (Rosanna Arquette) and they arrange to meet later that evening. On the way there he loses all his cash through the open window of a speeding taxicab and is left with few dollars. On top of this, Paul soon realizes that Arquette is not his type and leaves to go home  only to find that local subway fare has been raised and he doesn't have enough cash to make it back to his apartment. Thus begins his nightmare.Scorsese's genius move here is that as Paul progresses onwards into the night, the film slowly loses its balance and topples over into a distinct category of weirdness. The beginning is fairly standard and realistic. It is typical Scorsese with exterior shots of New York City, character-driven dialogue and so on and so forth. About 1/3 of the way through it becomes a bizarre Terry Gilliam-esquire hell ride and Scorsese lets loose on everything. It's brilliant film-making and a devastating satire of New York's late-night underbelly. The original ending (storyboarded but never filmed) involved Paul being reborn after crawling through a random woman's legs  that's how bizarre, and creative, this film actually is.Dunne is suitable in the role of Paul  a fairly unknown character actor; he doesn't have the charisma or talent to be a typical leading man. Which, I think, is part of the reason he seems so comfortable in the role of Paul, who is certainly one of cinema's most unusual heroes. Another film might setup Paul as a meek, hard-working, likable guy who gets stuck in bad situations  when in fact Paul is a confident jerk who probably deserves what is coming to him. Before picking up Arquette he flirts with her roommate (Linda Fiorentino) and gives her a back massage. He puts the moves on Arquette, then ditches her when she resists. He's not shy and he's not an all-around good guy  he's a flawed character that only helps the entire experience feel more realistic.Scorsese is at the top of his game here. Many techniques would be used five years later in GoodFellas. Note the ringing phone and the abrupt lunge forward; the keys being tossed out of the window in first-person perspective; the rotating camera as it pans around Paul's head in a diner; and so on and so forth. Although it is not his best work nor his most distinct, After Hours is ample proof that Scorsese has a firm handle on black comedy and is able to stretch beyond his (arguably) typified style of gangsters and low-lifes planning how to ""whack"" people. Scorsese bashers should see this, and his fans should too  insightful for everyone.",After Hours
24,lost-in-limbo,Are you sure you want to go out after hours?,10,8 March 2006,"Paul Hackett works as a bored word processor and lives rather quietly repetitious life, but that pattern is broken one night when he chats to a mysterious girl, Marcy at a night diner.

Now this when everything goes pear shape for Paul, as he encounters trouble in a taxi, with Marcy's roommate, a bizarre waitress, a all to friendly barkeeper, a crazy lady who seems to want to hurt him and so-on. All of these confrontations put him on the brink of madness, where no one seems to be sane enough to give a helping hand. What a peculiar film! I don't know, but this flick just totally caught me off guard with its unsettlingly twisted nature. I would even go to say its one of Scorsese's ambitiously finest, if not one of his best. ""After Hours"" is an extreme black comedy that's just so hypnotic with its smoothly unpredictable rhythm, humorously edgy characters and New York's downtown setting that creaks with a dark and moody embrace. After a matter of minutes I was deeply hooked, as I felt every painstaking ordeal that Paul has to go through. You do feel sorry for the guy, but I had trouble wiping the grin off my face as the humour is just enchantingly warped. Mostly the premise is all about picking on our protagonist who just wants to get home, but he can't seem to take a trick by getting himself into one horrible disaster after another. But don't be expecting a laugh out loud broad comedy that'll cheer you up because the lean humour comes with a straight face and has a real cruel streak about it, with anxiety, paranoia, anger, suicide, crime and frustration being the key ingredients involved. The film has a very surrealistic nightmare air about it, with it resembling that off a modern day fairytale / fantasy. Think of the likes of ""Alice in Wonderland"", but even more so ""The Wizard of Oz"", with a reference or two of the latter movie creeping into the story. Though, the surreal moments don't take anything away from realistic actions of these quirky episodes. The story it made up of increasingly whacked-out episodes, which all add up and feed off each other to turn Paul's night really upside down. Scorsese's eye for detail, emotion and atmosphere comes speeding to the forefront. The trance like atmosphere is capitalized by having it set all at night (except for the opening and closing minutes) and the film's backdrop is brought to life with its menacingly empty look. This bleak night tone totally suits what the film is going for. The biggest asset of the film has got to be Michael Ballhuse's handsomely orchestrated cinematography that moves along with such sharp and penetrating shots. This is where the emotion hits its cue and the whirlwind of absolute adrenaline builds on the eccentrically unstable pattern of the story. Also Scorsese's delivers some eye-catching shots that are a work of genius. The script by Joseph Minion it made up of pieces that seem to interlock the tales together and form that of a puzzle (like a crossword) were every small theme is important to the rest. There are so many little things you pick up on throughout the misfortune's journey. The dialog is filled with many cunning jibs, awkward conversations and interesting developments. You can just sense trouble, or a strange turn is on its way, but trying to predict what is... is beyond possibility. I also thought the ending wrapped it up rather nicely; even alternate ending (which is on the 'making of' feature) wouldn't have been bad, if a little more strange, actually a whole lot more! Other notable strokes that have become somewhat of a trademark of Scorsese, would be jumpy pace, showily quick editing and boisterous score which fits in some classical music in the more stable moments (opening and closing moments.) The film trumps a sensationally strong cast who assert their own weird flavour and imperfections to their characters. Griffin Dunne is fantastic as frantic Paul Hackett, who seems to stick out like a sore thumb when compared with the rest of the characters he meets on that horrendous night in downtown New York. You get terrific performances from the rest of the cast too. Rosanna Arquette is innocently sweet as Marcy, Linda Fiorention as Marcy's artist roommate Kiki, John Heard as the friendly barkeeper Tom, Teri Garr gives a memorable performance as an unstable waitress Julie, Catherine O'Hare plays Gail the crack pot, Vera Bloom plays the lonely June and Cheech and Chong play some bumbling thieves. Other familiar faces that show up are Dick Millar, Robert Plunket and Will Patton. This genuinely overlooked, vigorous dark comedy is hard to get comfortable with, but it flows with such freshness with its directorial inventiveness and deadpan humour. Definitely my kinda stuff!",After Hours
25,ElMaruecan82,A Nightmarish Experience for an Underrated Masterpiece ...,10,22 July 2011,"The oldest trick of the 'thriller' genre is to take one ordinary person, and make him live an extraordinary situation. This was Alfred Hitchcock's trademark, which worked because it created enough empathy toward the hero to captivate you all through the film. In Scorsese's underrated masterpiece ""After Hours"", not only this plot device worked, but it did with a sort of metaphysical dimension that transcended the most paranoid of all Hitch's films.« After Hours » follows the nightmarish journey of Paul, an ordinary word processing employee, trapped in the deserted and foggy streets of SoHo by night, during what should have been an ordinary date. Griffin Dunne exudes an ordinary appeal, which I guess, mirrors the actor's less iconic stature that Marty's previous lead: Bobby De Niro and keep us neutral in the beginning.As the movie progresses, Paul grabs our interest, his readings prove higher-than-average intellectual predispositions and creates a realistic mutual attraction between him and Marcy. Rosanna Arquette is perfectly cast as the cute and sensual young New Yorker, well-educated but not sophisticated enough to find Paul dull and uninteresting. She gives her number; Paul calls her and gets a date after a touching struggle to overcome his timidity. Paul is the perfect antihero for Scorsese, charming but not charismatic, although his awkwardness punctuated with frenetic outbursts of temper sometimes reminded me of a younger Pacino.""Whatever can go wrong will go wrong"", says Murphy's Law. The first glimpse on what will be a special night starts with the speed-driving taxi cab, who made Paul's only 20 dollars bill flying out the window. Paul meets Kiki Bridges, a weird papier-mâché sculptor who introduces in Paul's mind the suspicion that Marcy might have severe burns in her body. We get the same feeling and Marcy's weird behavior confirms the possibility. We're put in Paul's position and wonder what can and cannot be as we undergo his instinctive decisions.Paul leaves, but doesn't have enough money to take the subway, a bartender wants to help him, but he must take his cashier's key, Paul accepts to do it, but then he finds out that Marcy is dead, then that she's Tom's girlfriend. Many other characters will try to help and cheer Paul up, but it only goes worse. A genius character to root for, as a sort of modern New Yorker 'Job, Paul is the quintessential good guy who's very kindness put shim in trouble with a unique talent to upset people. From the cocktail waitress Teri Garr who draws and Xeroxes his portrait, to Tom's neighbors who mistake him for the serial burglars that operate in the area and the ice vendor who'll lead the vigilante mob posse formed to track Paul, no one will give him a break.And Marty's treatment is so special that we wonder if laughter is an appropriate reaction, if it's a dark comedy or funny drama. It's hard to tell considering the serious issues the movie tackles but the crescendo is so efficiently gripping you get the feeling that the inner demons of New York City waited for Paul as a punitive wrath from God. In the climactic sequence, self-loathing Paul addresses the almighty God: ""Why me?"". The religious undertones reflect Scorsese's feeling at that time when the falling down of ""Last The Temptation of Christ""'s project profoundly affected him as he needed to prove himself still capable to direct. The emotionality carried by Paul is Marty's reaction to a series of personal misfortunes, and now that he's the Maker, he can have HIS break. And his urge to make the film and get through his personal crisis parallels Paul's disastrous night.You'd never see Cary Grant having a nervous breakdown and shout 'Enough!' in ""North by Northwest"". The paranoia here is total because there seems to be no particular reason for this stuff to happen, except some kind of divine malicious intervention. And the uncertainty of the ending creates even more tension. But I'm glad they kept it happy with that surrealistic touch that conveyed the nightmarish aspect of the film. Paul finally woke up and is the first to get in the office like he was the last to get out. The circle is full and as the closing credits started, Paul is dissolved in the immensity of the Open Space, and becomes an anonymous, a luxury he could fantasize on during that crazy night.The movie embodied nightmarish feelings with a stylish efficiency that reminded me of ""Blood Simple"". Houses take a significant part as places where Paul has no bearings, reviving some of my early nightmares when I couldn't figure where I was. The hostility of streets are reminiscences of ""Taxi Driver"" where the neighborhood replaced Travis Bickle as the embodiment of New York's state of mind. It's a good man vs. the demons of New York who ""mostly come at night"", not the aliens, but New Yorkers alienated by their own ways of life. Finally, the nightmare sensation is completed when Paul relates his story. And it seems so disjointed, and absurd that even Paul didn't believe this really happened.In a way, the star of the film is essentially Scorsese, deserving his Best Director Award in Cannes Festival as it's one of his finest directed films, whose 'dropping the keys' shot remains the trademark. The dizzy direction creates an unsettling feeling all through the film as we follow Paul's movements, not to mention the shots where Paul is running, convincing of the approach of an imminent danger. But I don't mean to make ""After Hours"" sound like an exercise in style, it essentially works because of the story. No guilt, no redemption but just the illustration of the way bad luck sometimes keep going on us.""After Hours"" is in my personal Top 5 of Scorsese's film including the classics ""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"" , ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas""  and this really gets better after each viewing.",After Hours
26,paul2001sw-1,"Alright, but not worth staying up for",6,1 March 2005,"'After Hours' is a minor Scorcese film, the story of a man who heads out one night on a hot date with a virtual stranger. But he loses his money, the girl turns out to be downright odd and everything soon runs totally out of control. It's a nice conceit, but the plot feels contrived and stretched, while the film is never consistently funny: in fact, it feels more amateurish than any of Scorcese's other works. Arguably, this sort of concept works better when there's a conspiracy involved, as in Fincher's 'The Game': otherwise, the hapless hero is left a victim of outrageously bad luck and his own stupidity. There are entertaining moments, but compared with 'Raging Bull' and 'The King of Comedy', which Scorcese also made around this time, it makes a very poor cousin.",After Hours

It's mildly entertaining with all of the misadventures this guy finds himself going through one very strange night, but to me it just kinda felt like a B movie, with a script that never really went anywhere interesting, marginal acting, and cheesy soundtrack. It's a Kafkaesque nightmare and yet it manages comedy elements and the offbeat mood of New York in the wee hours, which is something though.",After Hours
28,inkblot11,"After all is said and done, this is a brilliant and excruciatingly funny film",10,1 May 2007,"Paul (Griffin Dunne) has just started training a fellow worker on the computer system for their firm. The co-worker has trouble paying attention, for he confides to Paul that he is upwardly mobile and will soon leave the mundane word processing tasks to underlings. This gets Paul to thinking about his life...is it too blase for words? When he returns home to his boring apartment and starts to watch another boring show on the television, he snaps. It is getting late, about 10 o'clock, but he decides to head for the nearest coffee shop. It is there that he meets an interesting woman (Roseanna Arquette) when he observes that she is reading the novel called Tropic of Cancer. She gives Paul her phone number and leaves. Back at his digs, Paul makes the call and is startled to get an invitation from the lady to visit her apartment in Soho. Isn't it getting very late? Nevertheless, he hails a cab and begins the ""after hours"" journey of a lifetime. From candles, to books on burn victims, to ladies who like go-go boots and The Monkees, to skinheads, to burglars, to sculptors into bondage, and more, this is a nightmare of a night. Will Paul make it home alive? This film is a brilliant black comedy of errors. Dunne is superb as the man who just wanted a bit of excitement in his world, not a hair raising encounter with the underbelly of existence in the wee hours of the morning. The rest of the cast, including Arquette, Linda Fiorentino, Cheech and Chong, Teri Garr, and others, is also absolutely wonderful. The sets, costumes, and production amenities are fine, as is Scorsese's great direction. However, the script is the triumphant winner here, being intricate, ingenious, and very, very funny. The final scene of the film, involving a fall from a moving van, is awesome and side splittingly comic. If you have any objections to humor that is far from wholesome, you should probably bypass this movie, unfortunately. But, if you want to experience the thrill of exhilarating and gleeful film making, this movie should not be missed. After all is said and done, this film deserves to be on the list of the top fifty flicks of all time.",After Hours

Dunne is perfectly cast as the schmuck who thinks he has lucked into a hot date, only to find himself trapped in a nightmare that he can't escape. Scorsese has surveyed the mean streets of New York numerous times before, but here he creates a uniquely surreal atmosphere in exploring the setting from the dark side. The cast of absurd characters is well played by Arquette, Fiorentino, Heard, Garr, and O'Hara.",After Hours
30,Rodrigo_Amaro,"""I just wanna go home!""",10,30 July 2012,"One night. One man. Infinite troubles and tumultuous situations that can ruin a man's life or just to make him realize he isn't so normal and so different from the insane characters he'll meet in this bewildering journey. What Martin Scorsese does in ""After Hours"" is a humored, provoking and dark challenge where his main character, the word processor Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne, great performance) is a guinea pig tested to the limit showing how difficult it is to be sane in a place that doesn't invite you to be mad, it violently grabs you to the madness in a endless night heading to the initial starting point. But he'll never be the same man as he was before.With no moment to waste, ""After Hours"" starts with Paul training a new comer in the office on how to work with the computer. Finished the work, he's in a restaurant when a girl (Rosanna Arquette) notices he's reading one of Arthur Miller's Tropic books, they start a conversation, liked each other, she gives her number, nothing's out of order. Back at home, bored and alone, Paul calls the girl, who invites him to go to her place in the SoHo to see some artsy paperweights she makes. What was an innocent date turns into a nightmare of troubled happenings from the moment Hackett entered in the cab, lost his money, met the girl that wasn't so good as he thought she would be (she's quite problematic, neurotic, suffered with plenty of men and she's married). So, it's better find the way back home. Yep, he's lost in the city, with no money in his pockets and no one's willing to help. Sometimes, they'll help but there's always a strange cost, there's always something in the way. Crossing his hallucinated path are a helpful bartender (John Heard), the hysterical waitress (Teri Garr) who'll try to accuse him of attacking her after Paul's reluctance in staying in her house, two ""robbers"" (Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong), killers, punk rockers, exquisite figures, a mob, all of them will try to take a piece of him. Why? Because he's the wrong man at the wrong time? No, because he's too careless, too reckless, selfishly unwise. ""I didn't know that"" says Paul almost constantly and that's his problem. The man who never knows anything always pays the price, doing wrong things, acting wrong over and over again, trapped in his own ignorance. Not all is tragedy, actually it's quite humored. Dark humored. Even Paul can be a little bit at ease and make a joke with himself, after testifying a murder across the street while hiding from the angry mob that thinks he's a dangerous person making constant attacks on the region. He watches the murder at distance and says ""I'll probably get blamed for that!"". For the most part, he's just like the man in Edvard Munch's painting ""The Scream"", suffering the century's anxiety and constantly begging for help. This minor work from Scorsese made right after ""The King of Comedy"" and still using of some twisted humor of the earlier film is a small masterpiece where he, master of his art, takes everything he knows about movies and composes an energetic, pulsating, funny and bright film. Appears to be somehow naive, simplistic but it's not. There's so much more than just hearing and watching the plot. Seeing is believing here. It perfectly matches in a non official trilogy I name of ""New York time bomb trilogy"", started in ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) and finishing with ""Bringing Out the Dead"" (1999), all stories taking place in NY, featuring characters living in the thin line between sanity and madness, just trying to get through the night. All of the main characters, Hackett, Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" and Frank Pierce in ""Bringing..."" are all creatures of the night, dealing with lot of pressure on a edgy, wild city that looks like a time bomb just waiting to explode at any moment and they need to decide which way is gonna be, to succumb to it or survive in it, and they're all stuck in a stressful and tiring routine. Well, Hackett is a little bit different though, he's not into something like being a paramedic or a driver, he's just a word processor (as he angrily shouts to God while trying to find a way out of his problems). He spent the whole day in the office and just wanted to have some good time with a girl he liked but got trapped in this maze. Take a look at how close those three films are, not just in their theme but also the way Scorsese edits, photographs, captures small things like the objects in scene, the camera movements, the music, each particular shot. It's a fascinating technique.Thank you, Michael Powell for being the source of inspiration for the most perfect ending this movie could have. And thank you Marty for nailing it again. 10/10",After Hours
31,johnnyboyz,"The sun goes down, the freak encounters come out. Scorsese swings and hits with this simply pitched, brilliantly executed film.",8,2 February 2010,"After Hours is one of those rare films that you get a chuckle out of during the end credits for reasons other than a collection of 'hilarious' bloopers; bloopers that aren't usually as funny as the makers think they are. In this case, it's the disclaimer that usually comes up nearer the end of the scrolling text stating something along the lines of: 'This is a piece of fiction. Any resemblance to a real life person; persons or occurrences are entirely coincidental'. When the credits were fully processed, you'd imagine those that did so would've got a chuckle of equal measure out of said statement upon additionally seeing the film.After Hours is like that though, a mixture of laughing at stuff that isn't ordinarily funny nor obvious to the eye. It's a film about a tale of one night out on the town as a man stumbles and fumbles his way through a number of incidences and interactions, ranging from the the everyday to the downright bizarre, but always arriving with a degree of sheer fascination at how it'll play out. The (mostly) unfortunate lead is a certain Paul Hackett (Dunne), a single man with a reasonably high-flying job in the borough of Manhatten, New York City. One night, meets a young woman named Marcy (Arquette) in a nearby café after a chance encounter involving the discussion of book titles. Paul's work is desk-job orientated and his attitude towards this work is only briefly captured at the beginning when a montage of items in the office in which he works is captured by way of his gaze: typewriters, filing cabinets and piles of paper that require attention. Does he despise this lifestyle? Does he rather enjoy it? Is the meeting with Marcy the ticket he's been waiting for? Is everything going to change? Scorsese leads us down a route, indeed a pretty familiar set up, involving a guy who lives by seeing the same things over and over again before stumbling into one of those routines when the chance encounter with the female stranger might be the key to something more.But After Hours is so much more. Scorsese's very sly, very gradual manipulation of the film's arc sees things take turns we do not see coming and incorporate content we do not expect. If one was to lay the cards out for all to see, one might label After Hours a circular journey; a series of events that tells its lead, in true Wizard of Oz fashion, that there is not a place quite like home after wanting to chase down a loose end; after wanting to live a little. If his office space is rendered a place of one thing at the very beginning of the film, it is later on rendered a place of pure salvation as heavenly sound effects and huge, pearl-like gates open up to welcome him back to normality.Paul's interaction with Marcy leads him to the apartment she shares with similarly young woman and sculptor Kiki (Fiorentino), when it transpires Paul decides to take Marcy up on her promise a paperweight at the designated address. It's from here that Paul has a random, yet thoroughly entertaining, yet somewhat intelligent adventure in and around the general area in the dead of night. Whatever danger lurks around whatever corner for Paul is initially established in Kiki and Marcy's apartment; a figure, a fairly frightened looking figure carved by Kiki stands beside her, looking as if it is cowering at the mere sight of her. This establishes a sense of danger Kiki might possess, as if the expression of the figure ought to be reminiscent of one's internal reaction to Kiki's character – wary and somewhat frightened. The essence of her sculpting and moulding skills are then eerily transfered into real life when she tries to persuade Paul to remove his shirt and aid her in using the gooey materials to help finish off the outer-shell of the figure.Despite the setting of the film being the dark, dreary and rather grimy streets of New York in the late hours of night and the early hours of the morning, its comedic tone and overall light attitude to the things that happen and the situations Paul finds himself in are not exploited in any way. Some of the characters he meets are crooks; some are seedier than others; some come across as violence prone, but the film does not utilise these traits as a reason for gratuitous or outrageous content. Scorsese, somehow, renders the film's atmosphere one that leaps from mysterious, to frightening, to quite alluring and then flits back to one of rather-a tragic nature – amidst the vast array of his directorial achievements, After Hours is most certainly one of them.Paul ends up duelling with just about everyone. He clashes with the opposite sex; an overall class different to his own; the state as well as sin itself. In roaming this part of town and systematically looking for a space within to kill the night off so that tensions can cool down and he can get a grasp on things, everything gets progressively worse. As a suit-clad and rather formal wearing man of high flying business profession, struggling in an around the vamps, tramps and thieves of this city in which he shares with them is a clash of class'. The film's flicking between comedy, horror and tragedy is best exemplified through the number of sins Paul must deal with; the sexually charged temptation that arises during a number of interactions with the female characters; the evading of the wrath an angry mob have in store for him when they mistake him for a serial burglar as well as the guilt he must defeat following the death of a pretty prominent supporting character. After Hours is a thrilling, taut and rather well handled piece which encompasses a lot of weight on a simplistic premise.",After Hours

33,leplatypus,It's never too late for a good movie (web),7,7 September 2013,"Honestly, it's a good surprise: as soon as the credits begin, the music wakes you up and rises you attention. It's easy and fast to understand that Griffin has a dull life: thus, he is open and not afraid of experiences. As soon as he meets Rosanna, he is on the gate of an unexpected journey. It's funny because the same thing happened to me: The first time with the single mother was to have a coffee at my studio. Then, on the spot, we decided to have dinner outside. Then, I asked her to bring her back home in the suburbs. Finally, with all this, it was late and when I arrived to the train station, it was too late to catch the last. So, I was like Griffin in Soho: alone, lost in an unknown district late at night and faraway of my home. I found a night bus to reach back Paris and there strangely, no taxi was roaming the streets. I hesitated to go to my job office as i was waited a few hours later and being in the middle from it and my studio. I took my luck for my studio and after a long walk, i got to my studio and just fall on my bed! So Griffin's crazy night is well done: It's really looks like Soho is another planet for him as the nightlife is indeed a bit particular there! His character is funny as it's easy to understand why he is single: too much impatient, self-centered and too much anxious! The strong points of the movie are that it's written with intelligence: Griffin is like a fly that has been caught in a web as with each steps, his adventure goes more and more silly where everything is finally tied! With that, the cast is excellent as his meetings are faces that we know: Rosanna, Forientino, Dante's buddy, the future parents of ""home alone. Ultimately, the last ten minutes of the movie is great cinema: It begun like a tragic parabola, then it's surrealist sunrise, and the credits are an amazing work of camera. So, with a few good shots of Scorcese during the movie, it's really an unusual funny production that offers an new look about NYC! In addition, you can see that Rosanna was a terrific actress thus I really don't understand why she had the career she had later!",After Hours
34,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A departure for Scorsese, but not as much as it seems",8,30 May 2011,"""After Hours"" certainly constituted a change of pace of Martin Scorsese, but maybe less so than you'd think. Despite ample laughs, a lack of mobsters and Cheech and Chong, the film still fits his library in exposing the off-kilter split-personality of New York City late at night and into the early hours of the morning. Scorsese has turned Joseph Minion's script into something preoccupied with urban culture and the twilight hours, when seemingly anything can happen.More unusual for a Scorsese film is the lack of A-list talent. Griffin Dunne headlines the cast as Paul Hackett, an average Joe who works as a word processor by day and never gets out at night. When he meets a beautiful woman named Marcy in a coffee shop (Rosanna Arquette), he decides he'll call her right when he gets back to his apartment. Although it's already 11:30 at night, she invites him over to her friend's loft in the SoHo district. Soon, the night begins to go strangely in Kafka-esque fashion, eventually spiraling out of control and driving Paul insane.To start, Paul loses his money on the way over and cannot pay the taxi driver. He then begins to learn some strange things about Marcy's life including her husband who lives overseas whom she writes every day. Eventually he realizes he's in over his head, loses his cool and ditches Marcy -- but it's not that easy as things start to come full circle.For a story hinging on suspending your disbelief regarding the number of coincidences and connections between characters, Scorsese provides the film a certain realism. The characters might all be crazy in some way, but their quirkiness feels natural. Scorsese recognizes that a lot of kooks live in NYC, but many of them are kooks with dreams and other definitively human characteristics. When Paul and Marcy meet in the coffee shop, Marcy points out the cashier and asks Paul if he thinks the guy is a bit weird. He's clearly practicing ballroom dance moves and aspires to be doing that professionally, not working at a coffee shop. That's essentially emblematic of New York City.As the strange and dark elements give way to comical lunacy as Paul's night gets worse and worse in improbable fashion, the film becomes more of a comedy and shifts its focus from a study of a city and its people to mainly amusement. The more coincidences and surreal antics that ensue, the more questions arise as to why Paul has become the Job of lower Manhattan and the more preposterous it all feels, which detracts from the deeper meaning.Yet Scorsese manages to ground this farce enough to keep it effective throughout. He does nice work with Dunne, who loses his cool a bit quickly and oddly at times, but manages to magnify our own reactions to the bizarre events unfolding before him.Fun is not a word that usually comes attached to a Scorsese film, but ""After Hours"" can be digested without shame and even without that pair of serious glasses that most viewers keep handy for one of his films. That said, those who bring them will surely find examples of commendable direction.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",After Hours

That's the story.The mood of ""After Hours"" is one of a lighthearted tragicomedy. Martin Scorseses ""After Hours"" is a little gem. Quite unigue. Very loveable. It is one of my favorite small Scorsese pictures which I must have watched over 10 times now. I watch it whenever I feel in a rut and want some comic relief. This movie is all about having fun with the little misfortunes of another person. In this case the character Paul who just wants to get home, but all sorts of disasters keep raining down on him, so he just isnt able to go home. Disasters of the personal encounter type: Paul keeps meeting people who get him into further trouble every step of the way.The story isnt very realistic, because how difficult can it be to just get home? But if you dont analyse it too rationally, then ""After Hours"" is hilarious at moments and astonishingly surprising. Great chararcters, witty acting. Lovely soundtrack. And just a bizarre, unique and funny plot. Highly recommended. Watch this flick in the wee small hours after midnight if you can. It hightens the feeling that you are all alone and everything can go wrong if you get into trouble and you dont have help. And that is exactly what the character Paul is facing in ""After Hours"". Will he get home? I wont tell, but it is a lot of fun seeing Paul trying just to get home. I would like to call it a ""suspense comedy"", because there is definitely something very suspensefull inside this tragic comedy.

36,jzappa,Scorsese's More Exotic and Refreshingly Odd Portrayal of New York,8,17 December 2006,"I've hardly ever put much thought into the SoHo district of New York City. You hear so much about Brooklyn and the Bronx and Manhattan and Chinatown and Little Italy that SoHo is a place that's open to speculation. After Hours, directed by Martin Scorsese, famously a native of NYC, creates hands-down his goofiest and most eccentric atmosphere of his entire body of movies. He creates an almost Cronenbergian or Naked Lunch-ish feeling, practically a zombietown that Griffin Dunne traverses through once outside of his workplace. It's fun, it's cozy, Scorsese and screenwriter Joe Minion's concept of SoHo alone being funny.The cast is full of people you almost mourn when watching due to how little we see them anymore. Dunne, though he carries the story well and has his funny moments, is hardly the film's highlight. Teri Garr, pre-multiple sclerosis beautiful Teri Garr, is quite funny as a cocktail waitress who desperately wants Griffin Dunne to stay at her apartment at the times when he is most needed someplace else or most in need of fleeing for his life. Catherine O'Hara plays a manic, scarcely feminine joker of a woman who lets Griffin Dunne use her phone, but never actually lets him call anyone on it. John Heard is a generous and congenial but at sharp turns poundingly violent bartender. Rosanna Arquette is their clever introduction to quirkiness, the date Dunne meets whose mannerisms and linguistics are just borderline nuts. Linda Fiorentino and Will Patton play the most interesting pair of sculptor and leather-clad S & M punk I've ever seen. And the fact that Cheech and Chong play a pair of bumbling burglars in a truck is funny in itself.After Hours is the only film where you'll find Scorsese using music from the present time, as you will hear to your surprise the 1980s synthesizer in the fittingly quirky musical score, but not for long. He bangs Bach's Air On the G String throughout, with Joni Mitchell, Robert and Johnnie, and The Monkees. This accompanies his familiar intensity with the camera as it soars and rams.After Hours is a wonderfully atmospheric, cozily quirky farce. One way to look at it is that in essence, it's a darker, longer, more violent episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.",After Hours
37,videorama-759-859391,Scorsese's one off,6,18 June 2017,"I don't know why Scorsese made this film. It's a question that quietly plagued me intermittently throughout. Normally he has points to his movies, or they're based on serious issues, or factual stuff, here, besides mocking up what New York can be like at night, where it can be crazy in the day too, it was a really kind of aimless, yet very attracting movie, with good performances to boot. I felt the same way about U Turn, when compared to Oliver Stone's other films. It's great to see Dunne, a really good actor, in the lead, which he does justice, but the other actors, who are just as good, should be credited too, especially O'Hara as one wild chick, with uncontrollable fits of giggles, one crazy, among a collection of strange people, poor luckless Dunne, meets on his night travels, where he simply should of stayed at home. I can't say After Hours is a good movie, or give it the thumbs up, but it is weirdly, or you could say uniquely entertaining, but seeing this is from Scorsese, it makes it a let down or disappointing as in quality. It's a movie that has you questioning, ""Did that director really make this"". The score I really liked, where it really fit the mood, while Dunne's performance was another thing. To make or carry the story along, it relies on strange offbeat characters and too many coincidences, but it is a satire, don't forget, sort of. What potency and importance underneath the satire can't be taken seriously because of those two things.",After Hours

The night long, reluctant pilgrimage made by mild mannered computer nerd Griffin Dunne into the artier underground corners of Manhattan is set in motion by a chance encounter with an attractive stranger (Rosanna Arquette), and ends, at sunrise the following morning, exactly where the evening first began, after a frantic and frustrating series of misadventures governed entirely by chance, coincidence, and the essential curvature of space-time. The escalating absurdity of the scenario helps to maintain a surprisingly lighthearted mood in the face of so many unsavory details, with a lot of credit owed to ace DP Michael Ballhaus and his grab bag of entertaining camera gimmicks.

Instead, his night turns into a nightmare, as he gets stuck in the middle of increasingly awkward situations...The movie is well written and acted, but it's Scorsese who adds the magic to make sure we won't be bored while we follow him on this trip in the Big Apple by night. He knows his city well, and he brings us with him in some of its weirdest corners, where peculiar people live and strange things take place.

42,Lechuguilla,Rough Night In Soho,7,9 August 2009,"Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) is an attractive, unattached, upper middle class Manhattan computer programmer. Hoping for a romantic adventure, Paul arranges a date with a young woman who lives in Soho, a part of Manhattan populated by people who prefer a more bohemian lifestyle. But Paul loses all his money en-route to the woman's apartment. And the romantic encounter doesn't quite work out like he had hoped. Disappointed, Paul just wants to go back home. But fate has other ideas. He becomes trapped in a twilight zone of bizarre clashes and surrealistic frustrations.The entire story takes place in the course of one night. Few people are on the streets, as it is a work night. And off-and-on rain adds to a feeling of helplessness and entrapment in Hades. The film's mood alternates between subtle humor at the predicament Paul has gotten himself into, and melancholy angst.Griffin Dunne is ideal as Paul: likable, smart, reasonable, slightly guilt-ridden and out of his league in an underworld of non-conformists, misfits, petty thieves, and other human creatures of the night. The message here is that one can be successful and comfy in a world of one's own choosing, yet a foreigner and even viewed as a threat in a different setting. Further, we are just one mistake away from the misery of a world where fate rules.The film's acting and eclectic casting are fine. Noir lighting is impressive. The film's score is subtle. I especially liked the songs: ""Over The Mountain"" and ""Is That All There Is?"", both of which add to the film's nightmarish atmosphere.The way Paul loses his money is a little hokey. And the plot becomes increasingly silly and preposterous toward the end, as each subsequent frustration has to be continually worse than the previous one.Overall, however, ""After Hours"" is an enjoyable film. It is an especially good choice to gain a sense of perspective. Not many ongoing experiences can be worse than the rough night that Paul has in Soho.",After Hours
43,barnabyrudge,"Outlandish, Alice in Wonderland-style black comedy.",7,26 May 2003,"Martin Scorsese is always going to be remembered for his gangster pictures and his collaborations with Robert de Niro. However, people shouldn't think that Scorsese's talent ends there. With this bizarre and unique production, he proves himself to be a dab hand at the jet black comedy.Griffin Dunne is excellent as a New York businessman who hits on a girl in a restaurant. The girl (Rosanna Arquette) invites him on a date, but when he gets there he finds that she lives in a really seedy district of town, sharing an apartment with a flirtatious female sculptor (Linda Fiorentino). One thing after another begins to go wrong and Dunne decides to ditch his date and go home. But fate conspires to muck-up his evening, and try as he might he just can't seem to get out of this crazy neighbourhood.Dunne's misadventures begin to resemble something from a violent. modern day uurban version of Alice in Wonderland. The people he meets are increasingly wacky or unhinged, and the situations into which he stumbles range from outlandish to nightmarish to life threatening. Throughout, this film is a deliberately oddball affair. Most of the time it is too disturbing to pass for an all-out comedy, but it remains compeeling thanks to its edgy script which never allows you to guess what is coming next. The pace seems deceptively slow on the first screening, but on repeated viewings it becomes clear that not a moment nor line is wasted, and that every little action links to something yet to occur or something that has already passed.

49,ShootingShark,Little-Seen But Brilliant Kafkaesque Comic Nightmare,7,25 September 2008,"Paul Hackett lives in NYC and is young, single and bored. One night he meets Marcy in a coffee-shop, calls her up and goes out for a date. As the night progresses, things go badly; he loses his money, he doesn't get on with Marcy, he can't get home, he's mistaken for a burglar and ends up with a lynch mob after him ...I love the queasy structure of the comic nightmare movie (see also Society or Nothing But Trouble) and this is one of my favourites; it starts completely normal, then becomes just a little awkward, then starts to turn nasty before metamorphosing into total nerve-shredding horror. Joseph Minion's brilliant script is Franz Kafka in modern-day SoHo populated by psychotic people up too late, as Paul races from street to street, from one awful situation to the next. There's even an explicit reference to Kafka with the scene where Paul argues with the bouncer, which comes from the Before The Law parable in The Trial. The story also has a great original character structure - one man and five flaky women; Dunne (who co-produced) is excellent as the bewildered, infuriated Paul, but the women are terrific. Arquette is the ultimate giggly space-cadet, Fiorentino vamps it up as a sexy sub-culture artist, Garr is hilarious as a waitress stuck in 1966, O'Hara is sensational as a total psycho and Bloom a tragic ageing wallflower. Macho men beware; this is not the movie to see if women intimidate you. There are also funny cameos by Cheech and Chong (in a Scorsese film !) and B-movie favourite Miller as a friendly diner owner. The movie's other strong suit is the zestful, fast-moving photography by the talented German cameraman Michael Ballhaus, in his first of many films with Scorsese. The camera-work really makes the nightmare come to life; the streets and buildings seem to somehow close in on Paul and there are so many brilliant throwaway shots (like the one of the spotlit mousetraps around Garr's bed), which tell us so much more about the characters' mental states than words could. There's also a great bouncy little score by Howard Shore, which ticks along with the clocks and watches that Paul is constantly referring to. I like Scorsese a lot, but I'm not awestruck by films like Raging Bull and Goodfellas the way some people are; as with many filmmakers, I often find his more modestly-budgeted movies more interesting and subtle, and I think this is one of his best, most original and stylish pictures. The direction is pretty much perfect (for fans, he also has a cameo as the spotlight operator in the Club Berlin sequence); it extracts all the emotional power from the story, entertains from start to finish, doesn't waste a shot, and keeps you gasping all the way. Terrific.",After Hours
50,truemythmedia,Scorsese's Unsung Comedic Masterpiece,9,23 May 2019,"I'm honestly surprised that this film didn't catapult Griffin Dunne into some kind of stardom, because his acting in this movie was absolutely stellar. His comedic timing, ability to show his hysterical uncomfortable thoughts on his face, and the subtlety with which he delivers his lines elevates this movie to the next level. This is a bizarre film, and without the proper lead actor I think it easily could've fallen apart. The characters in this film are expertly written, and though we never really know much about any of them, we sympathize for them when bad things happen to them, despite being able to laugh at the situations they're in. Duune strikes a perfect balance of being a perfectly naïve protagonist while still seeming rather smart; things take him and the audience by surprise and his reactions are almost always laugh inducing.
I really enjoyed ""After Hours"", and I couldn't believe I'd never heard of it before. It's a Scorsese film that feels nothing like Scorsese, but still has the cinematic craft that were used to seeing in his films. This is probably the funniest of his films I've seen other than ""Wolf of Wall Street"". It's a pity this film hasn't received the praise it deserves. Check it out if you get a chance.",After Hours
51,a_chinn,"Martin Scorsese's cult ""yuppie nightmare"" comedy is still great",9,22 October 2017,"I was 13-years old when this film came out and for whatever reason, it absolutely clicked with me and I became kind of obsessed with it. It was around this time that I started to notice film directors and the visual flair Martin Scorsese brought to this picture dazzled me, as did the offbeat story. Taking place within the space of one evening in Soho, Griffin Dunne calls up a woman, Rosanna Arquette, for a date who he just met at a diner. From there his evening becomes a series of strange interactions with the color, offbeat, and downright strange denizens of NYC at night. Dunne is the identifiable ""normal"" everyman character who just wants to go on a date but instead finds his money flying out a cab window, buying weirdo pop art from Linda Fiorentino, befriending a 1950s refugee, Teri Garr, awkwardly finding himself helping Arquette's ex-boyfriend, John Heard, and that's just the beginning. From there it just gets weirder as he runs into other colorful characters played by Cheech & Chong, Catherine O'Hara, Verna Bloom, Will Patton, Victor Argo, and the great Dick Miller. Scorcese's ""comedy"" nearly becomes a horror film in the mold of ""Repulsion"" or the ""Tenant"" with Griffin Dunne's evening turning into something of a surreal comic nightmare. ""After Hours"" was part of the cycle of ""Yuppie Nightmare"" films, which included the likes of ""Into the Night,"" ""Something Wild,"" or even ""Blue Velvet,"" a somewhat forgotten sub-genre. Kudos also go to Howard Shore for his fine score and to Michael Ballhaus to his dizzying photography. Overall, this is Scorsese's most ""1980s"" of films and I think one of his most underrated, very much worthy of it's cult status.",After Hours
52,davidmvining,Pitch black comedy,10,4 March 2021,"Martin Scorsese obviously has a dark sense of humor. After Hours, his only outright comedy, is the tale of a young man who travels across Manhattan to meet a girl in the middle of the night and ends up being chased down by a mob convinced he's a thief, trying to kill him. Inspired by Kafka and Hitchcock, After Hours is a very funny look at a night gone wrong, with our yuppie hero lost at how he got into the mess and how he could possibly get out of it.We begin with Paul Hackett, a word processor for a large company in New York, instructing a new employee on the specifics of how to load data into the company's system. Right away we see Paul as he is: disinterested in other people. The new employee tries to tell him about his plans for the future, which includes creating a new magazine, and Paul just walks away. That night he chooses to go to a small diner for dinner alone, reading Tropic of Cancer, when a pretty young woman, Marcy, begins to talk to him about the book. She mentions that she's going down to Soho to stay with a friend who sells papier mache donut with cream cheese paperweights. Would he be interested in buying one? If it gets Paul a phone number to contact Marcy, then yes, he would. When he calls her later that night, she invites him down to Soho, and he goes without a second thought. That's when things start to go wrong.He has a single twenty dollar bill for cab fare there and back again that flies out the window of the cab. When he gets to the apartment, the friend, Kiki, throws the keys to the place down and he lets them drop to the pavement. Marcy's not there and calls Kiki, and it's obvious that Marcy regrets having invited Paul over at all. Paul gives Kiki a massage, obviously with hope that the night won't be completely wasted, but she falls asleep. Things seem to be perking up with Marcy comes back and seems open to him, but he gets freaked out by a medicated cream he finds in her things for second degree burns made no better by a text book filled with images of such injuries. Feeling like he's not getting what he wants, he picks a fight with Marcy and bugs out of the apartment, but he has only ninety-seven cents and the subway fare went up to a dollar fifty just that night.He goes to a bar where the waitress begs him through a note to save her from this job she hates and the bartender offers to give Paul the money for the fare from the register, but the register won't open. The bartender offers to give Paul his keys to go up and check on the bartender's apartment, afraid of the robberies going on around the neighborhood, but Paul offers up his own keys as collateral. He floods the guy's apartment. The waitress quits her job, attributing her move to Paul and seems interested in sleeping with him. And all he wants is to get home. When he finally turns her down, she whips up the mob against him, and literally everyone in the neighborhood goes after him.Paul, you see, refuses to connect with anyone throughout the night. He enters into this foreign land for himself only to find that everyone knows everyone else. When the bartender gets a phone call that his girlfriend died, we instantly know who she is, and so does Paul, even though we've never heard the bartender mention her before that moment. A lot of what Paul goes through would have been avoided if he had simply tried to connect with anyone on any level other than his own desires throughout the film. He could have found out the truth about Marcy's burns. He could have had a place to sleep with the waitress if he had just listened to her. If he hadn't been so dismissive of everyone, maybe he could have gotten what he wanted for any of them.There are two major interactions that dominate the final portion of the movie. In the first, Paul goes up to a man's apartment, with the man expecting a sexual encounter, and Paul just screams the story of his horrible night to this man. The second is when Paul finds shelter in the Club Berlin, and he actually, finally, tries to connect with someone. She's an older woman, alone at a table, and he doesn't scream or harangue. Instead he talks to her like a person, asking for help, giving her a dance as the bar closes up. Because he finally treats someone like a human being, he finds a way out.Being a borderline absurdist comedy inspired by Kafka, though, his way out isn't as simple as getting a few dollars for a taxi. Instead, the woman encases him completely in papier mache. He gets stolen as a piece of art, and then he falls out of the back of the van right in front of his workplace. He staggers to his desk, covered in dust.On the surface, this is a very funny movie of a night from hell where one man goes to an unfamiliar part of town and gets sucked into everyone's business, none of which he's interested in. His frustration with being unable to get home becomes the center of humor in a dark way, much like people trying to navigate life and bureaucracies in Kafka's work. Underneath all of that is the tale of a man who just wants to live a selfish little life, and he gets punished for it, barely escaping with his life and ending up right where he began. Will he have learned anything? It seems like he did by the end, turning this tale of mistaken identity into a moral one.Funny, satirical, almost manic in energy, and well performed, After Hours is Scorsese at his most playfully comedic. That it's also a rather dark adventure makes it all the more entertaining.",After Hours

54,Movie-ManDan,All Around Great!,10,7 March 2020,"Following the success of Martin Scorsese's 'Raging Bull' America's greatest director was in need of reinventing himself. 'Raging Bull' is arguably his finest work that was also the last film in a chapter in his career. Enter the 80s. The boxing biopic may have been in 1980, but the rest of the decade did not bring as much success as the previous decade, despite doing some good movies such as 'The King Of Comedy' and 'The Last Temptation Of Christ.' The most underrated film in the legend's most underrated era is without question the bizarre black comedy, 'After Hours.'If I would have to compare 'After Hours' to another, better known movie, it would be 'The Out-Of Towners.' Both films are about average Joes who encounter an endless string of bad luck in New York City. But Scorsese's flick is even crazier.In more detail with what the film is about, Griffin Dunne plays a word processor named Paul Hackett who meets a beautiful woman (Rosanna Arquette) in a coffee shop and they hit it off. When he goes to her apartment and meets her eccentric roommate (Linda Forentino), all seems to be going well and so does the movie itself. So far, the movie is a romance in New York. Paul has little self esteem and blows up at her when things start to get serious. While Paul encountered some bad luck earlier in the night, they were thing he could brush off. After his date, the bad luck gets shifted into overdrive. So much happens to Paul after his date for the rest of the night that it would exceed this review's limit.In one of Martin Scorsese's most enjoyable films, it is simply impossible not to like this. The comedy, drama, thrills, and technical aspects are all super. And there is no predicting what mess Paul will get himself into.There is nothing wrong with making a normal comedy just for fun. But this seems like it was trying to tell something. Paul learns his lessons with women by himself, so that's not anything huge. I think this is Paul's night to really experience life. He has a boring job, but a night of chaos can really shake things up for him. Sure literally all of what happens to Paul they night is bad, but at least he's living. He's out of his boring desk and out of his apartment and into the world. While 'The Out-Of Towners' seemed to be a hate letter towards the Big Apple, 'After Hours' could deal with some of the same things but that's not the primary focus. This is about living life, no matter how bad the world may be. But maybe I am wrong and I am just looking into this too much.4/4",After Hours
55,Galina_movie_fan,"""Rough night, Paul?""",10,6 February 2009,"Perfect flawless black comedy with humor as dark as the night that caught Paul Hacket (Griffin Dunne), a nice guy, an everyman, an ordinary computer operator in its darkness and surrounded him by all kinds of weird strangers who very well could be the deadly creatures of night that inhabited SOHO of early 1980s every night after hours... or perhaps they are still there? If ever a brilliant film was made about a worst nightmare come true, After Hours it is. This movie seems so different from what we've come to associate with Martin Scorsese but it is undeniably his film. It takes place in NYC, and its dark scary streets come directly from Scorsese's earlier masterpieces, ""Mean Streets"" (the streets after hours are even meaner, are they not?) and ""Taxi Driver"", the horrifying descend to the real Inferno.Amy Robinson, the film producer calls After Hours ""dark, funny, paranoid New York summer movie"" - and it says it all. This movie makes me think how great it would be if Scorsese turned to comedies (not the Hollywood brainless light romantic comedies but ""dark, funny, paranoid"" type) more often. I have to mention writing which is absolutely brilliant, considering that it was the first work by Joseph Minion. Roger Ebert, who recently has included After Hours to his list of Great movies, mentions that Minion's teacher, the Yugoslavian director Dusan Makavejev, gave the script an ""A."" Having seen Makavejev's infamous Sweet Movie, I am not at all surprised. I also want to mention the camera work by Michael Ballhaus, the German cinematographer who has made fabulous in their beauty films with Rainer Werner Fassbinder. It seems to me that Scorsese might have seen Fassbinder's The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant because both films share the claustrophobic and suffocating atmosphere which was captured amazingly by Ballhaus. After their first work together on After Hours, Scorsese and Ballhause would make The Color of Money (1986), The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Goodfellas (1990), Gangs of New York (2002), and The Departed (2006).The journey through the worst night ever by Paul brought to mind another surreal journey, one of my all time favorites, ""O Lucky Man"" by Lindsay Anderson. After Hours is in the same league for me. In both films, the nice guys take a trip that would turn brutal, bizarre, dangerous yet irresistibly funny. Mick Travis wanted to succeed in life while Paul Hacket only wanted some fun night and perhaps to get close to a beautiful woman he'd met earlier (Rosanna Arquette). Instead, he would encounter a trio of mysterious and dangerous women who seduce, mystify, and horrify him (Linda Fiorentino, Terri Garr, and Catherine O'Hara). And I don't even mention all crazy male characters. After Hours does not get mentioned among Scorsese's most remarkable and memorable films but it is. Even if it takes place in the 80s, it is timeless; it does not lose any of its dark nocturnal power. It is a great work of the master who has been always passionate about cinema. Scorsese made After Hours when he was forced to stop working on ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and was depressed, frustrated, and uncertain if he would ever return to it. Scorsese told his friend Mary Pat Kelly. ""My idea then was to pull back, and not to become hysterical and try to kill people. So the trick then was to try to do something."" Scorsese later confessed that working on After Hours gave him back his love for making movies. The members of the jury in Cannes Festival were certainly mesmerized with Scorsese's inspiring directing. They awarded him with the Best Director Prize in 1986. If ever any director deserved it, it was Martin Scorsese for the marvel which After Hours is.10/10",After Hours

I reacted to it more as one long anxiety dream than as comedy, although in a different context, like Charlie Chaplin moving from one frustration to another, I can see the comedic potential. Perhaps on second viewing I would be more receptive to the comedy rather than the anxiety.Paul's interactions with the people he encounters on his nighttime odyssey are all, well, rather weird. So weird in fact that none of them is quite believable. But, I suppose they are no more than exaggerated riffs on personality types that are more familiar, at least in New York.An intriguing aspect of the film is that, while recognizing it as pure artifice, I was sucked into the story. I suppose that is testament to Scorsese's skill as a filmmaker.",After Hours
58,film-critic,What would you do with a night on the town?,8,7 November 2007,"This is a small, probably unseen gem which demonstrates quite a bit of talent, some humorous moments, but mainly soul, rhythm, and excitement. ""After Hours"" was a surprise, because I think I had heard a joke about Scorsese and comedy, but he pulled this one through, providing classic cinematography, that darkened edge that was enjoyed in ""Bringing out the Dead"", and a solid character to lead us through the night. ""After Hours"" gave Marty the inspiration he needed to continue to make films, and it is a little gem he should never be afraid of.This film takes place during the course of one night. As a series of unfortunate events happen to our lead, Griffin Dunne, we watch as he encounters bar keeps, ice cream truck drivers, paper-mâché bagels, 50s-style waitresses, Cheech and Chong, Mohawks, and finally an aging woman at a bar who also loves, you guessed it, paper-mâché. While it seems like the night comes full circle, the events that occur during the 97-minutes are pure entertainment as well as pure Scorsese. From an acting standpoint, only one character needed to be developed enough to enjoy. Dunne is reminiscent of a young Gene Wilder in this role with his passionate rants and witty retorts. Dunne is also easy to follow through this journey, as he is the quintessential ""joe-shmoe"" with the go-nowhere job looking for a night on the town. As he gets wet, hit, excited, and nervous, the audience can relate to him. He is perfect for this role, and his mannerisms fit with his character. Those surrounding Dunne also create their own ""oddities"" of the city. Rosanna Arquette is mesmerizing as a woman with potential burns and non-cohesive tendencies. We never know if she is the truth or instigator of this evening. Linda Fiorentino is decent, but John Heard punches in the laughter, as does Teri Garr and Catherine O'Hara. The cameo by Cheech and Chong may date this film, but it added to the inconsistent chaos that transformed ""After Hours"" from mediocre intertwined story, to independent cult classic.Outside of the quirky characters that Scorsese has ideally placed throughout this film, the cinematography also is an element to enjoy with this film. Scorsese doesn't just sit back and film with generic stock footage; he uses his patented techniques to give us his own signature film. The scene with the keys was impressive (as well as added to the overall oddities of Dunne) as well as the scene near the end where Scorsese takes us around Dunne's office in a swooping visual treat. These are two to watch, but also look at the smaller moments. Scorsese proves in this film that he can handle singular shots as well as full-framed moments with hordes of people. His talent behind the camera isn't wasted or misused; he takes what could have been an average zany night out using Hollywood recycling, and transforms it into a Scorsese picture worthy of his repertoire. Let us not be mistaken, this is a Martin Scorsese picture, and one should not neglect it when mentioning the others in his award winning portfolio. Scorsese isn't known for his comedy style, but with both this and ""Bringing out the Dead"", he really creates his own type of comedy and dives headfirst into the darker element of the trade.On a very small note, Scorsese's use of mythology is slight, but intensely focused in ""After Hours"". The fact that this entire evening happens with the dropping of a set of keys, the opening of a large gate, like a boy heading into manhood or to his first adventure is enjoyable. This film was the study of a man entering life, going from death (the working at a dead-end job) to a life full of adventure on the streets (perhaps not paying the river-man the right amount due to him driving too quickly and his $20 flying out the window), and finally back into death (the swooping final scene) is highly symbolical of the circle of life. Only Marty could give us this deeper meaning on a comedy. ""After Hours"" is a perfect pairing with ""Bringing out the Dead"" with its focuses on life versus death. A side note, but well worth mentioning.Overall, this was a welcomed surprise. I wasn't familiar with Scorsese's ""After Hours"", but it was obviously his film with signature cinematography, apparent cameos, and dedicated characters. This feature has just as much heart, soul, and energy as any ""Mean Streats"", ""Goodfellas"", or ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", and honestly should be credited with giving Mr. Scorsese the inspiration to keep working. Without ""After Hours"", our cinematic theaters would never have known Christ's final thoughts. If you are looking for a comedy, a late night snack, or a great project for your final film class, this is the perfect film to use. It is often overlooked, but should be catapulted into cult classic status. It had everything from monumental lines (who can't laugh at the plaster of Paris cream cheese bagel?), amazing scenes, and characters that kept you glued to the screen. Watch it. I promise a great night out exploring the lonely streets of New York  that side we never see because it is  ""After Hours"".I know, laugh, but it was worth the corny, albeit cheap, shot.Grade: **** ½ out of *****",After Hours
59,sharky_55,I'll probably get blamed for that.,9,3 April 2016,"Has Paul Hackett ever stayed up this late before the fateful night in After Hours? My guess is no. He's a middle-class office worker who has little to attract or like about him; even a lowly temp-worker waffles on about his dreams of giving the unknown intellectuals of New York a space for their voices to be heard, and Paul is drifting out of the conversation, focusing on little inane details in the background and lazily lambasting his own lack of passion. But even he isn't dumb enough to turn down an opportunity with Marcy after a spontaneous meet cute in a cafe. The later he stays out, the more out of his element he becomes, and strange, nightime forces begin to morph his encounters. Ballhaus' cinematography seems to blow everything out of proportion, much like Paul does. The first instance of bad luck is the swept away twenty dollar note out the taxi window, captured in this poetic shot as if it was a leaf blowing in the wind. It then turns up again later in the film, taunting Paul on the chaotic, mindless logic that seems to rule the night. In the diner too, as he tries to recover from a slight mishap in wooing Marcy (after zoom-ins on winks that seem to say that everything is moving along nicely), the camera again magnifies every tiny bit of paranoia that drifts into his mind as he witnesses the blatant flirting with the owner and quickly lets go of her hand in closeup. And then as the night goes on and each obstacle stacks on one after the other, Paul becomes desperate at any kind of escape, and the camera frantically moves towards the telephone that will get him back home, and later practically pounces upon Gail's phone. Much of the humour of After Hours is from the fact that these incidents of bad luck keep hurtling themselves at Paul, unrelenting and without reasonable cause. Minion has embedded his script with an awareness of the usual romantic or erotic conventions. He at first tries to woo the artistic and free-spirited Kiki; it seems the opportunity basically falls into his lap as she requests a massage, already half-naked. He assumes that sensual position behind her, and just as he is past whispering and about to make her move...she starts snoring. Later the same mood is ruined; as he and Marcy return from the diner, he pulls her back to him and leans in for the romantic kiss (a move that has been perfected over decades of romantic movies) until she starts sobbing. And then she is on and off - lighting a candle and hungrily kissing him, and then going into vivid detail about a traumatic rape that would sour any sexual encounter. A simple quest for sex has turned into something unbelievably convoluted and unexplainable. Nothing seems to go right for Paul. As he is continually rejected he glances over to the next apartment and the first thing he sees is a copulating couple. Later he does so again and just happens to witness a murder, to which he sardonically remarks he will somehow be caught in the mess and blamed for the act. Toilets overflow, cash registers don't open, fares increase at midnight, and a bouncer, in the vein of Kafka's Before the Law, frustratingly withholds entry to a club. When he returns to find the now dead Marcy, the suicide itself is second fiddle to his unwrapping of her corpse. In a blow of cruel irony, he finds he has blown his chance with someone flawless and beautiful, as her porcelain skin reveals no blemishes. The forces and creatures of witching hour mock him at every turn - their dialogue cackles and reminds him of each misfortune, each turn of bad luck and missed opportunity. He can do nothing but submit to the surreality of the night. In After Hours, a character says he will be back in two minutes, and returns a little more than an hour later.",After Hours
60,aciessi,Midnight Movie,8,22 January 2021,"What is going on here? It's hard to casually explain. After Hours is one long nightmare, essentially. A seedy tour of late night, 80s NYC. Naturally, the producers went to Martin Scorsese, who captures that world like nobody else. But be warned, this isn't a pure Marty project. Much of this film is written just as it would be if a first timer was at the helm. It's edgy, bizarre, unfocused and disorienting, just like the best indie movies are. For certain, this is the black sheep of the Scorsese's legacy. If you can keep with it until the end, it's rewarding.",After Hours
61,TOMASBBloodhound,A unique experience.,10,15 July 2007,"To get an understanding of the caliber film we're dealing with, you have to imagine some of the finest elements of other films being wound into a tight 95 minute package and directed by the incomparable Martin Scorsese. After Hours reminds this critic in many ways of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. But somehow it seems to be about the best elements of that film. Our film deals with a mild-mannered Manhattan office worker taking a late night trip to the Soho district to meet up with a beautiful woman he first encountered earlier in the evening. So, much like with Tom Cruise in EWS, we have a protagonist searching for love in a world completely foreign to him. But instead of a never ending and overly talky film, we get a tightly wound and much better paced film from Scorsese. When the film does slow down for conversations, the ones we're treated to are comparable to the best Tarantino ever wrote for any of his films. Fortunately we don't get too many of them, like we would in a Tarantino film, however.Griffin Dunne plays Paul Hackett, who is bound and determined to hook up with Marcy (Rosanne Arquette) whom he met in a restaurant earlier that evening. Once he makes it to Soho, Paul quickly realizes this spur-of-the-moment rendezvous may have been a terrible idea. Apparently Soho is (or was in 1985) a macabre place full of eccentric artists, bondage enthusiasts, and vigilante mobs made up of mostly gay people. Not only does Paul fail to score with Marcy, he ends up being stranded in the neighborhood with no money to get home, and being blamed for several apartment break-ins by a crowd that wants his blood! Every place or person he turns to for help seems to get him deeper and deeper into danger. There are all kinds of famous or soon to be famous people popping up in little roles here and there. Will Patton as a leather clad bondage enthusiast may be the most odd. Also look for Scorsese in a nightclub sporting a beard and shining a spotlight down on the rowdy patrons.Unlike many Scorsese films, this one does not rely much at all on violence to get the point of danger across. I believe there is only one violent death, and the victim is not a main character. But in true Scorcese form, the scene produces a laugh! More than anything else, this film has a claustrophobic feeling. It's as if the world is crumbling all around Paul Hackett, and the next door he walks through may be his last. By the final fifteen minutes, he finds himself in the apartment of a gay man he picks on the street. To the man's obvious disappointment, Hackett simply wants someone to tell his story to. Before the scene has any type of logical conclusion, Hackett finds himself back on the street running for his life once again. His momentary attempt at finding compassion shattered in the blink of an eye. The whole film is kind of like that.After Hours may not be for all tastes, but this critic first saw it back in junior high and never forgot what a treasure it is. 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.",After Hours
62,tbills2,The Good Ol' Sweet After Hours,6,10 February 2021,"The opportunities are limitless in the strange, romantic after hours of New York City's downtown dwellings. Time just flies when you're kicking it with Rosanna Arquette or her pretty roommate, Linda Fiorentino, who parades around topless in one instance from this 1985 Scorsese-directed cult classic. People know this, man. Griffin Dunne is actually very memorable and agreeable in this dream starring role of his, also you're sure to recognize plenty of other friendly faces along the ride in this cool, once-in-a-lifetime, nocturnal adventure. Like Teri Garr. Be advised though, one who watches After Hours openheartedly acquires a certain, indistinguishable spiritual reckoning that cannot be undone once upon viewing. Worth the watch though. Final little tidbit, After Hours came out the very same year as Into the Night with Michelle Pfeiffer and Jeff Goldblum, both having very similar nighttime-themed stories.",After Hours
63,petra_ste,Kafka with a wink,8,11 November 2013,"Scorsese's funniest movie, this dark comedy follows meek New Yorker Paul (a brilliant Griffin Dunne) as he ventures for a night outside his safety zone in an unknown neighborhood to a date with a cute young woman (Rosanna Arquette) he barely knows. Soon enough events take a dangerous turn: his date is a creepy disaster, he meets increasingly weird individuals, an angry mob mistakes him for a criminal and chases him through the streets as he desperately tries to go home. The book Paul reads enraptured at the beginning is Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer, a picaresque novel full of seedy sexual encounters and drunken escapades - that's obviously what Paul was dreaming of, but expectations clash with a dangerous reality he isn't prepared for. Scorsese, Dunne and writer Minion successfully play it for laughs, but Paul's nocturnal adventure has the uncanny quality of a nightmare - it's no coincidence a scene with a nightclub bouncer mirrors Kafka's short story Before The Law. Dunne even kind of looks like a yuppie version of the Czech author.The ending is a little gem. Through the use of religious imagery - Paul's ""resurrection"" after getting out of the statue, the bells, the great gate... - the movie ironically implies that Paul, after his disastrous attempt at a new life - which turned out to be a hellish experience - returns to his own personal heaven and benevolent ""god"", his computer in a pleasantly dull office.

64,gab-14712,"A Scorsese ""Minor"" Picture? Yeah, You Should See It!",8,3 July 2020,"The 1980's was an interesting decade for Martin Scorsese. After Raging Bull, the director made quite a few films this decade-including After Hours. These films are, sometimes unfairly, categorized as minor Scorsese films. They are not Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, but they are still solid-to-great films. It took me some time to get my head wrapped around this film, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Just like 1983's King of Comedy, Scorsese attempted to blend dark comedy and satire with his features and did so with relative success. Like all of his pictures, Scorsese continues to tell tales about New York City. As a New Yorker, he is the right man for such authenticity. Is there any city in the world other than New York which would allow a mob to form over a simple act of thievery? Most likely not! Still, we are treated to a very angry ice cream truck lady.Are you one of those people who believe that you have such bad luck and what could go wrong, does go wrong for you? If so, you may find Griffin Dunne's main character very relatable as he suffers everything from rising subway prices to sexual advances being turned down consistently. It is definitely a character that a film maestro like Scorsese would understand. This sort of film is part of a subgenre called ""yuppie nightmare cycle"" which combines two film genres- screwball comedy and film noir. Yeah, you'll be laughing and feeling sorry for Paul Hackett and his misfortunes, but do not be surprised if you are clinching your armrest with such ferocity during the many intense sequences.Scorsese nearly did not make the picture, as Tim Burton held high interest in filming the story, which was written by film student Joseph Minion. Scorsese, at the time, was in production with The Last Temptation of Christ, which was his baby. Paramount was giving him hard financial issues, which made him put that film on the backburner. He turned to independent studios and learned about this story through Dunne and his production partner, Amy Robinson. He decided to direct the film which gave him a much-needed respite from the pressures of filming his baby. Even though this is a smaller film, you can tell it is a Scorsese film. People would often compare this film to a Coen Brothers film, both of whom were getting their feet wet in Hollywood at the time.Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne) is a lonely man and is fed up with feeling that way. After he finished work, he meets Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) at a coffee shop. He earns her phone number. When he calls her, he is invited to her apartment where she rooms with a rather kinky artist, Kiki (Linda Fiorentino). From there, his night takes a turn for the worse. His mission is to get home, but it seems like New York City refuses him to go home as he faces angry cabbies, a waitress (Teri Garr) and an ice cream truck lady (Catherine O'Hara) who form a mob against him, a bartender (John Heard) who is not surprised about what is happening anymore, rising subway fare, and the list goes on and on. What does poor Griffin have to do to end his misfortunes?To no one's surprise, the performances are excellent all the way around. Griffin Dunne really impressed me and certainly made his character relatable. His way of delivering black humor in the dialogue is awesome. Rosanna Arquette was a great find! Out of all the female performances, hers was the best. I mean, how can you deny a performance when she uses The Wizard of Oz to describe sex from her former husband. John Heard, as the indifferent bartender, is fantastic! Even going to the extreme minor roles (Dick Miller as a waiter) has its purpose.On the whole, give this film a watch. The film blends comedy/satire effectively while ramping up the pressure moments. The intensity is so high, I felt like exploding at times. I actually felt, perhaps, the film could have been too intense for its own good. The pacing is incredibly fast. You will see plenty of Scorsese-isms throughout. You see the smoke rising from underneath the sidewalk? Yep, shades of Taxi Driver there. And of course, he continues to explore the city of New York in his films which older residents may view as a documentary. Like all of his movies, the film is tightly-edited (Thelma Schoonmaker), has explorative camera movement (Michael Ballhaus), and boasts a great soundtrack (Howard Shore). As a ""minor"" film, Scorsese used this feature to continue his growth as one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.My Grade: B+",After Hours

68,Horror-yo,Good - even for a Scorsese skeptic,8,7 May 2017,"Like it or not. This film does one thing really well. It does really, really well at catching your attention and never letting go of it. You can regard it as one giant attention-catching moment that is the whole film in its entirety, or a series of attention-catching spurts that somehow don't get formulaic and redundant.The events happening aren't even that interesting or brilliant, but they do so well at keeping you, the viewer, hooked and curious what happens next. At very, very least, even stripped of its symbols and what not, in its most plain viewing, this film must be considered an entertaining watch.Not being a Scorsese fan at all myself, the directing is really good. It conveys that sense of a Kafkaesque-nightmarish sort of feel and does really well at being straight to the point, and not dwelling too long on its weirdness. It's strange, original, but efficient. It is not self-indulgent or edgy like such films always are.It's also just the right length. The story of a man who can never get home, in a familiar but equally surrealistic environment, told in just the right amount of time, with just the right start and ending to it.

69,policy134,One that will forever stay with me as a disturbing but also fascinating exploration of the human psyche.,8,27 March 2005,"Griffin Dunne was born into a cultural family. His father was a playwright and I think that his background has a lot of similarities with Scorsese's favorite, De Niro. Maybe that's why he is so good in this because he looks like such an ordinary guy. He is slightly more handsome than De Niro but in a crowd he would totally melt in.The film was not one that Scorsese had decided to film himself from an early stage but I think that without him it could have been a terrible bore. Scorsese has a rapport with actors that is totally unique. That's why so many of the actors in the movie give the best performances of their career here. Let me name just a few:1) Rosanna Arquette: This and her performance in Desperately Seeking Susan go hand in hand here. She has been kind of lost since then but the way she plays totally clueless and still manipulative is really superb. It also helps that she is extremely hot. 2) Catherine O'Hara: Her insanity is set in stone almost from the first time we hear her speak. It's odd that she has been mostly known as a comedienne. 3) Teri Garr: Another comedienne. Sidesplittingly funny in Young Frankenstein and here demonstrates an untapped range which has gone unused to this day. 4) John Heard: His sinister personality is not apparent but you can almost feel that he is about to burst into a fit at any moment. It's also funny to think that five years later, he and O'Hara would play the most loving parents to a boy who would be the biggest box office draw in the early part of the 90's.There are also a few cameos from actors who were primarily known in underground movies where Scorsese started his career and even a few seconds with Cheech and Chong.So I will say that had Scorsese not made so many other memorable films this would have been his crowning achievement. It does have a few moments where it goes a little over the top, like when we meet the character Horst, played by perennial weirdo Will Patton, but those scenes are such a small part of the whole that it can be overlooked. For the most part it's a fascinating experience and one that can never be duplicated.",After Hours
70,elicopperman,A Night Unlike Any Other,7,30 March 2019,"For every culturally recognizable film by Martin Scorsese, there are those that are more obscure yet still well done. One of them is After Hours, a bizarre dark comedy about a man named Paul Hackett who experiences a multitude of misadventures trying to get back home from New York City's SoHo district at night. What's interesting to note is that Tim Burton was initially going to direct the feature, but Scorsese wanted to do it to get funding for his passion project The Last Temptation of Christ, and the rest is history. So with all that said, while it might not rank up with one of Scorsese's greatest efforts, it's still an overall fun time.Part of what makes this feature such a thrill ride is the unpredictable nature of it all. All throughout the feature, Hackett gets into different forms of circumstances, from getting caught up with a depressed narcotic named Marcy, to losing much of his money, to even getting mistaken in a burglary epidemic. One thing that makes Paul relatable is how sick he is of his mundane life, which in turn makes him somewhat of a jerk. However, the fact that all these shenanigans in the city happen to him makes his reactions and paranoia all the more hysterical. The humorous cliched trope of meeting a young woman at a coffee shop ends up being completely subverted once Paul goes to SoHo, which in turn kickstarts the truly horrendous night he ends up having.In spite of all that, anyone going in to this film could be surprised as to how many scenes in it are actually more serious than funny, with talk of suicide, sexism and even domestic abuse. This ends up creating a bleak contrast between the more humorous moments while giving off a sadder tone that doesn't always feel consistent to the film's intentional wackiness. To be fair though, it does replicate the film's metaphor of feeling like a horrid dream of nothing ever going right, in New York City no less. Scorsese has definitely captured the grittiness of that city before, but considering that the film takes place in one night, the portrayal of anarchy becomes much more down to earth, even if it is exaggerated to heighten up the viewing experience.From a technical standpoint, the film has a lot of frantic and briskly paced editing techniques. Some scenes utilize a zoom in panning shot such as when Paul is on the phone, which helps elevate the unrelenting pressure he displays. Lastly, the acting is noticeably cheesy but still a lot of fun. Griffin Dunne successfully captures Paul's bitterness and inner aggravation depending on the situation the character gets into. Everyone else either displays both an innocent and crazy side like Rosanna Arquette, Teri Garr, John Heard and Catherine O'Hara or are just all around idiosyncratic like Linda Florentino, Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong, Clarence Felder and all the other supporting players. Together, all the distinct acting talents combined culminate into a majority of nut jobs that completely break a well mannered man in just one night.So in the end, in spite of the fluctuating tone, After Hours still works as a relatable dark comedy with a main character who just wants to escape a massive series of predicaments, like many of us do. It might not be laugh-out-loud funny, but it's still worth the experience just to know what will happen next throughout this crazy night. If you're a fan of Scorsese of you're just into dark humor all together, definitely give it a watch to see how far insanity can be pushed in a nasty environment like the NY areas. After thinking about it myself, I can definitely see how Tim Burton could have done wonders with this feature, although it would have been far more surreal and looney. Either way, the film is appropriately exaggerated to the nth degree to bring home the message of the grass being greener on the other side like no other film typically does.",After Hours

I've often found Scorsese's films to be loaded with pacing problems and while the final half hour or so here does drag a little bit it wasn't nearly as what I usually experience with his work.The trim 97 minute running time flies by in a breeze, piloted by Griffin Dunne as a mild-mannered word processor who meets an attractive girl in a coffee shop (Rosanna Arquette, aptly matching that description) and experiences the worst night of his life when he goes to see her at her place. After Hours is quite possibly the ultimate late night comedy, loaded with eccentric and hilarious characters whose quirks are always entertaining rather than grating. Dunne's Paul Hackett falls down a descent into the madness of late night New York, the city which Scorsese earned his reputation depicting.The director took on this film after his first attempt at The Last Temptation of Christ fell apart and you can really tell that he just wanted to let loose and have some fun, a feeling that translates easily to the audience. It's nice seeing him stretch himself into the comedic world and he succeeds to a point where I really wish we could see him attempt it more often. There's a rhythm to this film, a real pulse that drives it so well. Special note should be given to Howard Shore's really tremendous musical score, which plays such a vital role in giving the film it's simultaneously exciting and terrifying atmosphere.As I said before, the time flies by and it's in large part due to how Scorsese orchestrates Hackett's mad journey. Watching it very late at night certainly only helped in increasing my strong enjoyment of the picture. I think that After Hours is most certainly the director's most underrated work, and as of now it's also my favorite of his career. Which was a welcome delight since to this point I had never come across a film of his that I was comfortable saying that in regards to.",After Hours
77,jackasstrange,A delicious film experience.,8,30 October 2013,"After Hours is one of those films which you can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it. Is just a delicious film experience. I'll try to make it short: We have, in the script structure,a formidable plot, totally affected by the French new wave, also known as the famous Novelle Vaguès. It talks about the wonderful and funny events in the story of a normal guy, which gets in trouble during a entire late night in the streets, where absolutely everything happens. I am not exaggerating. All the imaginable and the unimaginable situations happen in the film.It can be a little 'slow paced' and boring in the beginning, but on the elapse of the movie you'll absolutely enter into it. 8.3/10",After Hours
78,CelluloidRehab,Bad date on acid.,8,21 October 2004,"Paul lived an ordinary life (rather boring also) on New York's upper east side and worked as a data processor for a financial company, where he trained Balki Bartokomous. He then met Marcy in a diner. Marcy was a beautiful and exciting girl who was staying in SOHO with a friend and happened to like Paul. Paul calls Marcy that same night (Trent and Sue would call this a faux pas) and she invited him over. From here on Paul takes the ride of all rides as he spends the entire night running around SOHO, in the rain .. with no money. Martin Scorsese pulls out a dark comedy that brings to light all of the nuances of living in New York (especially 80's NYC) : taxi rides, drugs, art, the punk movement, the subway, clubs, bars, gays, strange people, stranger people and even Cheech and Chong make an appearance. I think the movie losses a little flavor for those that have not experienced living in New York, but nonetheless is still a hilarious movie. The LA version of this movie would be Blake Edwards' Blind Date. A little historical tidbit ; the subway fare back in '86 was around 90 cents and not the $1.50 the booth operator asks for.",After Hours

81,quaseprovisorio,it's a great well scripted crazy movie that's taken to the next level due to scorsese's direction.,8,14 June 2020,"After hours is one of the craziest movie experiences we can find. pretty much because at a certain point there like three things ocurring at the same time: somewhere are keys while someone is waiting for him, while he's in one place needing something from the bartender. then he goes there again, meets someone else, and we wait for the rest of the details to unveil.it's the type of movie where the small subplots are actually the movie. the people he encounters and the places he goes. in a city that doesn't seem to sleep at all, a neighbourhood that doesn't allow him to leave. like a nightmare yes, but also like a maze where he's always facing walls, and when it seems he's getting somewhere there's another wall. it's also important for our hero to be an everydayman with a boring job and doesn't seem to have many perspectives of future. he just goes for a meeting with a girl he randomly talked on a cafe.then you have scorsese directing this woolen ball. what scorsese makes? well. almost each scene is memorable. first because again a bunch of the scenes are subplots, so each time he sees someone different or is on a different place you almost have like a short film going on. scorsese uses panoramics like a king, but also small detailed shots, or the wide shots where we can check so many detailes into one frame. it's like he knows how to do this and how to compel the viewer in order to follow the adventures of our hero.this film wants to show one guy outside his neighbourhood, its comfort zone being confronted with a lot of misfortunes. a boring dude with probably a boring life having a night like he never did before. it's also kind of a love letter to a city that always has something going on, where anything can happen. It's underrated mostly because scorsese directs this beautifully without flaws and the script is smart on adding conflict after conflict after conflict.it's the best scorsese i already saw? no. but it's a very good film that deserves more recognition. and i would love scorsese to direct something like this again. a film where we have fun, memorable scenes and a very well set pace that doesn't allow anyone to sleep. even after hours.",After Hours
82,pkzeewiz,A movie with lots of twists and turns.,3,12 May 2010,"This is a film that is all over the place and has such a twisted story to tell. It's basically about a guy who meets a girl in a café and exchanges numbers and he later calls her and she invites him over...sounds simple enough...far from it, he has the most bizarre night of his life and meets some of the craziest people hes ever encountered. From wild cab rides to angry mob chases to drug overdoses and people who hold him down to give him a Mohawk, he has a wild night.This movie is so twisted and very dark at times, it's one of those movies that will almost have you screaming at your television. It was ironic, very ironic...maybe too ironic and thats why it was fun to watch.It was rather slow, it took forever to get started and even then the pace didn't pick up well. I was rather bored through most of it. It had almost no funny parts, it was a comedy, but felt like a drama with a noir feel to it.Martin Scorsese did an okay job here as director, but it's not his best work, at one time Tim Burton was attached to direct, and although he wasn't famous back then, I still think a film like this would've been better under his vision. Howard Shore did the score and I wasn't very impressed, in fact I disliked it many times. I was happy to hear Bad Brains ""Pay To Cum"" played in the punk rock bar because I love that band.Acting wise the movie starred Griffin Dunne. It had a lot of cool people on it including Roseanne Arquette, Linda Fiorentine, Catherine Ohara, John Heard, Thomas Chong, Cheech Marin, Dick Miller, Bronson Pinchett and of course Teri Garr, who had the funniest lines in the film.Interesting movie and if anyone likes strange bizarre films then this is for you, it lacks comedy big time though, but its fun none the less 3/10 stars.",After Hours
83,HelloTexas11,a roller-coaster ride through hell,8,25 February 2008,"'After Hours' tells the tale of a young man's night from hell in that part of Manhattan known as Soho. Everything that can possibly go wrong for him does, and often in ways he could never have imagined. Griffin Dunne plays Paul Hackett, the unfortunate in question. Martin Scorsese directs and while the film was not a financial success, its reputation has grown over the years. One of the fascinating things about 'After Hours' is how so many different plot elements seem unrelated to others, and yet turn out to be in fact very closely related. A chance meeting with a beautiful young woman (Rosanna Arquette) in a coffee shop leads Paul to head to Soho for what he hopes will be a date with her. He can hardly believe his good luck. The first inkling of trouble is when a cab driver races like a maniac through the darkened streets and Paul's only money, a twenty-dollar bill, goes flying out the open window, lost forever. From there, the bad fortune and mishaps that pile up on the guy come flying so fast and from so many directions, it's almost impossible to list all of them. It is really like a nightmare come to life for him, albeit an excruciatingly funny one at times. His encounters with various characters are rampant with misunderstandings. People get mad at him, refuse to help him, chase him, cut part of his hair off, and threaten to kill him. The woman he was supposed to meet ends up killing herself, and Paul suspects it's because of something he said. He comes across another woman who is bound and gagged; he tries to untie her only to find out it's part of a sex game she plays with her partner, who comes in and says, ""That was rude of you, Paul. Why did you do that?"" Paul doesn't know. ""I do,"" the man says. ""Lack of discipline."" Paul meets more and more oddball characters, almost all of whom end up hating him for things that aren't his fault. There is the blonde who is stuck in the sixties (""Do you like the Monkees?"" she asks him), a gay man who mistakes Paul's plea for help to mean he wants to go to bed with him, a bartender who befriends him initially but goes to pieces when he finds out his girlfriend has killed herself (yep, it's the same girl Paul was supposed to go out with). And on and on. By the end, Paul is a man on the run; seemingly everyone in Soho is after him, his picture posted on telephone polls and shop windows. He is finally encased inside a coat of wet newspaper and plaster of Paris by a sympathetic woman (or maybe she's just crazy, it's hard to tell), stolen by Cheech & Chong, placed in the back of their van and driven to his place of work, where the movie started, just as the sun comes up. He falls out of the back of the van, the dried plaster breaks... Paul stands up, brushes himself off and goes to work. It's a shame 'After Hours' didn't find an audience as it's wonderfully scripted and directed and very original. Next time you have friends over to watch a movie and you want something offbeat, pick 'After Hours' and be prepared to see jaws drop.",After Hours
84,coop-16,"Scorsese's""Lynchian""film",9,18 March 2003,"Martin Scorsese is often condemned by his critics(Medved,Goldman) as a crude, bloodthirsty film director.I personally believe that Scorsese is NOT bloodthirsty, and that his films without bloodshed, or with minimal bloodshed(Age of Innocence,Kundun) are just as good as his ""violent"" films. This is a case in point, a superbly paced, well told (another myth about Scorsese is that he ""cant tell stories"")urban nightmare, with superb performances by a great cast.

It's bad to see how a normal guy can get into irritating troubles without really having influence on the incidents. I like how the story flows including the excellent cinematography of Michael Ballhaus and the directing of Martin Scorsese. There is no lag in the flow, no part which is too long winded, all of it is interesting, but also somehow unreal. I like the short running time of the movie, so it's more packed and concentrated.

But was this a fantastic movie regardless!.The positives are that its filled with rich characterisation and great acting to follow suit. The main actor is interesting and his performance as well as the strange events that take place make this tragically very funny. The plot is interesting by itself but you mix in very strange characters and a main actor that just can't get a break make this one of the weirdest and best movies I've seen.Around every corner, every scene, there is something more interesting and buzzar than the last. This has various sub plots and a main plot that are very interesting and its almost like a puzzle where he has to go complete a task before unlocking the next piece of the puzzle.I would highly recommend this. I have never seen a movie quite like this before and to my surprise this was very good.",After Hours
87,Jonathon_Natsis,There's no place like home.,9,19 March 2012,"It's funny how different New York can be made to look depending on the time of day. During the day it's a whimsical place where love and old friends seem to wait around every corner. As the sun goes down, the city becomes a haven for political conspiracies and drug deals gone wrong, while the dead of night favours suicidal taxi drivers, glitterati orgies and, in the case of Martin Scorsese's 1985 cult classic After Hours, the flat-out worst night of your life. Part adventure-thriller, part black comedy, this film is without doubt the best-hidden gem of the respected director's storied career.Paul (Griffin Dunne) lives about as plain a life as one can live. Retiring to his favourite diner after another mind-numbing day as a file processor, he bonds over a Miller novel with the pretty Marcy (Rosanna Arquette). After some casual flirting, Marcy convinces Paul to go back to her apartment, but after he storms out following an argument, Paul finds himself running into all sorts of weird and wonderful creatures of the night, including a seductive punk-chick artist, a disturbingly friendly bartender, a waitress stuck in the swinging sixties, a couple of stoned thieves and a sociopathic truck driver who mistakes him for said thieves. As things go from strange to sinister, Paul becomes increasingly desperate in his bid to just get home.It has always been one of the longest-held truisms of film that if the mind's eye notices something that looks out of place or somehow inorganic to a scene, even for a fleeting second, that object or instance is almost certain to play some role later in the story. After Hours is packed with moments like these, and the film demands a second viewing on this basis alone. The peculiar lingering of the camera on the bartender's keyring, or the cook's insistence that Paul must order something before he can use the restroom only scratch the surface in explaining how delicately every scene is tied together. The result is a dreamlike atmosphere where all events in the film's universe are linked in an extremely fascinating, thought-provoking yet justifiable manner. Admittedly, the film does not take itself as seriously as more poignant Scorsese works like Taxi Driver or Raging Bull. And yet, the tone remains one of paranoia through exposure and sheer danger, actually not unlike the vibe of contemporary classic Drive, where it feels as if the devil himself lurks in every dark alley. The staples of classic Scorsesian filmmaking remain prevalent: New York setting, zippy camera-work, an engaging soundtrack and enhance the film's accessibility, allowing different audiences to appreciate it on different levels of sophistication.After Hours is a masterclass on how to generate audience sympathy. Appearing in the first Scorsese film not starring Robert De Niro in ten years, Dunne steps up to the task admirably, displaying the kind of excellent balance between mental desperation and physical comedy that encourages the audience to view him not as a caricature, but as an everyman we can relate to. It might be due to this level of sympathy developed for Paul, in his soul-crushing determination to return to real life, that some may take issue with the film's ending. Employing one of the most blatant uses of deus ex machina this side of the millennium, personal satisfaction with the final scene could well dictate how this movie is judged overall. However, those who recognise the many similarities between After Hours and The Odyssey by Homer, from which this film appears to adopt the spine of its plot structure, will recognise that things can really only end one way. Rumour has it that two other endings were considered and possibly filmed, one melancholy and one downright insane, but by comparison, it certainly seems the lesser of three evils was chosen.After Hours is an absorbing adventure sure to thrill the senses and stir many a heated debate well after the closing credits. This is no horror film, but a warning to any nightlife lovers out there: one screening and you might find yourself deferring your weekend plans in the city for a stay-in pizza and your favourite blankie instead.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

Everything is there, perhaps a bit magnified in order to create a more dramatic effect: the craziness, the desperation and the fear in the night time. Scorsese didn't create this one to entertain the masses with a wild comedy; this is a testimony of a person who has been with the 'creatures of the night' and needs to reflect his impressions in his audience.I just don't know why this hasn't been released on DVD yet...10/10",After Hours

After Hours is a stroll down a very gloomy and strange 1980's New York city. It's a tale of one man's struggle to stay sane in an insane environment, and to live peacefully when everything around him keeps falling apart. But don't get me wrong - this macabre piece is not the serious cinematic masterpiece it sounds like. Talented director Martin Scorsese crafts weird and very human characters that anyone can relate to, using dark and twisted humor to get his message through.

Following up The King of Comedy (1982), Scorsese created yet another offbeat story filled with tension and danger set against the juicy backdrop of New York street life in After Hours (1985). This film finds the perfect note in combing aspects of black comedy with a general sense of unease. Definitely NOT your typical Scorsese film.We've all had those bad nights; Maybe we missed that subway coming home from work or got showered with a puddle by that car driving by. But we'll forgive those nights after seeing what Paul Hackett endures - he's just your ordinary word processor and one night we find him reading his book in a Manhattan cafe. He meets Marcy, a seemingly normal girl who shows genuine interest in Paul. The two hit it off. Naturally. And Paul decides to see her later that night.Perhaps the first bad sign should have been the abnormally out of control cab ride he has. The cab flys so fast down the road that the only money Paul had on him for the night flys out the window. Little does he know of the series of problematic and life-threatening events that await him. We'll learn that he tries to escape but (in almost a perfect embodiment of 'Murphy's Law'), by one inexplicable happenstance after another, something will prevent him from doing so.""After Hours (1985)"" showcases Marty's true filmmaking skills - the beautiful tracking shots, the extreme close-ups, the dark and foreboding lighting; it's all there and brilliantly keeps the viewer in a state of paranoia and discontent.

On the other hand: to date, I've been lucky enough to never be stalked by a vigilante lynch mob (unless you count Facebook).

97,davidals,A VERY different sort of love letter to NYC,7,15 September 2003,"*SPOILER ALERT*AFTER HOURS has typically been viewed as one of Martin Scorsese's minor films, but this excellent, frenetically-paced dark comedy works at a number of levels, while also  perhaps unintentionally  raising a few provocative questions. In a sense a VERY different sort of love letter to New York (if you get off on the raw, electric buzz of NYC, this film is for you), AFTER HOURS follows Paul (Griffin Dunne) through what begins as a spontaneous attempt at a date/hookup, and swiftly degenerates into one of the worst nights of his life. The uncomfortable outside scenes (constant drizzle) and the always claustrophobic interiors amplify the story perfectly, as Paul loses money, keys, is mistaken for a burglar and is ultimately chased through SoHo by a vigilante mob  AFTER HOURS is often hilarious, and relentless, with precious few moments of relaxation provided. The social ideology running through the film is provocative as well  and somewhat disturbing  as Paul (a rather wholesome looking yuppie) ends up being 'persecuted' by a series of casually weird performance artists, leather freaks, bikers, hippies, punks, gay people and psychologically unstable women  this self-contained enclave of bohemia en extremis is clearly a world that the wholesome-looking Paul is incapable of comprehending, and definitely doesn't belong in. The political implications of this reflexive anti-bohemianism is the lone flaw  problematic as this is otherwise one of the most immaculate 'dark' comedies you'll ever see, perhaps the least-known of Scorsese's many worthwhile films. Minor quibbles aside, this is a remarkable piece of work  the pacing is exhausting (Scorsese manages to very realistically reflect the sensory-overload rawness of New York), the ensemble cast is consistently (occasionally shockingly) great, and the use of music to advance the story (The Monkees, Joni Mitchell, Bad Brains and Peggy Lee all help to advance several great scenes) is also stunning.

His Paul can't get a break until art intervenes (suggested by the late, great Michael Powell), bringing this hilarious endurance test back to square one again. If you've never watched this, you're in for a treat. Linda Fiorentino and Rosanna Arquette (each at her sexiest) are terrific in the night and day loft mate roles. Character specialists Will Patton and John Heard get the best parts of their early careers.

It's a good movie and there is some fun to be had if you are viewing it for the first time, but the way the story comes together just seems forced and contrived to me now. I've always had my pet theories about how writers come up with scripts like this and, while I mean no disrespect to the writers of this film (who clearly had talent), I can imagine some sort of scenario where, having completed the initial outline, the writer leaves the thing on his desk for about six months and adds another twist to the story every Tuesday morning after finishing his morning coffee and taking a dump.

I heard about this movie a few months ago when I read Roger Ebert's review and he absolutely loved it, so I gave it a go and what did I get? One of the best films set in New York City ever! This is directed by Scorsese so as soon as I heard about it I knew it was going to be great, but it was even better than I expected, Griffin Dunne's performance is mesmerising and New York is also another lead character of this story.To sum it up for you, the movie is basically about a guy who has bad luck one night in NYC, meets a lot of crazy chicks, gets involved in the death of one of the females he met and people believe he is the suspect and go after him. He goes into a night club, gets pushed out, meets Catherine O Hara's character, who he later finds out she is in the gang that is going after him, he tries to escape, goes back to his workplace and survives, good one Paul!The frantic camerawork is genius and what Scorsese ended up doing in Goodfellas and Casino. That's another thing I have to mention about this film, the editing is superb, Scorsese's direction of this movie is amazing and the ""Good morning, Paul!"" on the desktop at the end is iconic.

He asks for help whenever he meets somebody but things just get worse every time he runs into a new person. In fact, all the people he meets are eccentric and paranoid. The night seems to be endless, and now Paul is not only trying to go home, he's trying to stay alive and get away from being ""killed"" by all those people who chase after him and think he's one of the burglars they've been looking for...This black comedy makes me laugh hysterically all the way from start to finish and I am breathless. It's something different and I like it. If you like comedies you've got to see this one. It's a classic!",After Hours
104,ToldYaSo,What is the moral here? Don't lie? or Stay away from blondes?,10,22 February 1999,"Oh sure, I could review a film that some of you have seen, but where's the fun in that?In Martin Scorsese's After Hours, you will find a dark ride into the fashionable Soho district of New York City of the mid-eighties that leads Paul Hackett into enemy territory.Once this average word-processing, white, single male realizes he's in over his head, he just wants to go home. Simple enough. But it's not that easy for him.He tells little lies that get him deeper and deeper into trouble until he's literally running for his life from the crazed denizens of the night, to whom ""After Hours"" do not apply.This film is a personal favourite of mine, but I really don't blame anyone for not liking it. It is a little weird, and that's why I probably enjoy it. I do believe this film has truly achieved what is known as ""cult"" status. Although I've never been fond of the term, I can't say I've met many people who've seen this film without my recommending it to them. But I've heard that it is something of a critical success.It is also very darkly funny.My wife doesn't like this film, she hates the main character and she finds his actions to be at times, stupid and irrational. She may have a point, but she's not appreciating the film from an angle of sheer desperation, which causes people to act in such a manner, which is what I feel the film is all about. That and that blondes are essentially trouble, no offence to my dear siblings.See it and decide for yourself. Worth hunting for. K.",After Hours
105,andrewburgereviews,"And so, Paul stepped into the realm where usual things don't happen very often",10,28 July 2019,"""After Hours"" is a very strange, but also intriguing movie. It takes place on the edge of reality, enforces Murphy's Law of ""everything that can happen, will"" at perfection. It is defined by circumstance--improbable, but also not impossible.Its lead is the most basic of human beings: Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne), an everyday Joe, working a 9 to 5 job as a word processor--one of the most basic middle-to-upper class jobs. He is a loner who has a nice apartment, a steady income and is pretty much as uninteresting as anyone can be. This is the beauty of this film. Scorsese designed the most trivial, simple human being and is giving him the worst night of his life.There is an amazing balance present here and it dictates the flow of the film. It does not let it tip towards ridiculousness and denotes so much bad luck that you would think it cannot be real. Yet it IS real, just very very improbable. As an everyday career man, of course Paul's objective is to find a girlfriend. So he does, in a coffee shop and so that night he goes over to meet with her. This is where I will stop describing the plot because this is where it gets interesting. What follows is a nightmare which almost feels designed by a higher power.Most of it is due to the people Paul meets throughout the night. None of them are truly evil, yet they are all strange, they almost feel like we stepped into a twilight zone where normality is twisted, but not beyond reality. It is this aforementioned balance that makes us feel unsure of what to believe anymore. These characters perform life-altering actions during that night which I will not spoil but honestly, no one has been in more strangers' houses in one night than Paul. He becomes more and more frustrated and I truly feel for him. This is another advantage of his simplicity--despite not knowing much about him, I felt I really knew him because he is general enough for everyone. This is a great screenwriting achievement.A particularly self-aware scene is when he describes all that he's been going through to a stranger he just met on the street and it would sound unbelievable if it hadn't just happened. You could argue that nothing out of the ordinary really happened in this entire movie, yet is the fact that everything happens too perfect, Paul always on the edge of the maze just before he gets dragged in the smack-dab middle out of a sudden.Despite its simplicity, ""After Hours"" is still a very Martin Scorsese movie. It's just that this time the odds are at a much smaller scale, the characters less powerful and more reduced in number. But it still has his trademark machismo style, the complicated women and the New York urban set-pieces.",After Hours
106,fatcat-73450,A Modern Odyssey Sauteed in Surrealism,8,15 October 2021,"A woman at a diner opens up a conversation with bland salaryman Paul Hackett. Despite the fact that she's clearly abstracted and not genuinely interested in him in particular, he takes her up on her offer to visit her flat in order to buy a bagel-shaped paperweight from her artist roommate.The rest of the film involves him getting into one challenging bizarre situation after another. Yet Hacket is no Odysseus. He is moderately ethical but no hero. He quickly comes to regret his decision and all he wants is to get back home.At one point he has to get a mohawk to enter a nightclub. At another he's hunted by a mob in an ice cream truck. And that's not to mention the bagel-shaped paperweight which kicks the whole adventure off.In short, it has its share of absurd situations. It might be hard to piece together what it all means or is meant to represent, but if all else fails, this is one of the most interesting ""wild all-night adventure"" movies out there just on visuals and subplots alone.Scorcese's clockwork-like style of directing for this one was also interesting to see.Honourable mentions: Reminds me of the hit SNES RPG Earthbound (1994) in that the protagonist here has to complete a series of tasks and deal with a motley bunch of characters in order to accomplish his mission all done against the backdrop of a surrealist vision of New York.",After Hours

Griffin Dunne is perfection as the computer operator who meets lovely but ditsy Rosanna Arquette in a diner and arranges to meet her late one night. His journey to downtown New York goes hideously wrong when he loses his taxi fare and spends the rest of the evening trying to get home. Along the way we meet feisty Linda Fiorentino, whimsical Verna Bloom, Gorgeous but hysterical Teri Garr and Dusty Springfield look alike Catherine O'Hara. We also get to witness suicide, murder, robbery and vigilante mobs in this tale of big city madness. The camera-work is stupendous and features every trick in the book.

108,spencer-w-hensley,"Interesting, well acted and directed, just not funny in spite of being labelled a black comedy",7,7 July 2021,"I'll admit I was hesitant to see this underrated Scorcese film. His previous black comedy The King of Comedy is still what I consider one of the worst movies I have ever seen and while Raging Bull and Goodfellas are undeniable masterpieces as well as the wonderful Aviator re-visiting Scorsese's filmography I was also disappointed in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.I didnt go into this with high expectations but surprisingly it was an entertaining enough film, far better than the aforementioned Scorcese disappointments and the acting and directing were both good, but this is labelled as a black comedy and I didnt laugh.Not to say that makes it a bad film by any means. I just feel it is far more effective as a drama, or even crime thriller.Griffin Dunne who I haven't seen in much aside from his supporting role in My Girl which came along six years later does very good in the lead, and the supporting performances from Rosanna Arquette, Terri Garr, John Heard Catherine O'Hara and Cheech and Chong are also very good.The film is far too interesting to ever be boring and I was never bored while watching it but I just expected some dark laughs and there weren't any.As a crime drama this works and any Scorcese fan or fans of these actors should definitely give it a look.View it more as a drama or even a suspense film and you will probably enjoy it even more.As it stands it's a solid entertaining effort with good performances. Not Scorcese at his best but very watchable and entertaining nonetheless.",After Hours
109,abyoussef,What a weird dream... experience? What....,10,21 August 2005,"by Dane Youssef""AFTER HOURS"" is a surrealistic experience. It's also one of Scorsese's lesser-known gems and as far as I'm concerned, everything the man has so much as ever sneezed on is a gem. I know that sounds very sad and slavishly faithful, (but keep in mind that the man has a great reputation for spinning cinematic gold with about everything he does). I know I sound like some kind of medication and therapy, but to that, I simply ask you all: Has the man ever made a bad movie?Many have complained that pretty much all of his movies are kinda the same. ""Mean Streets,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Casino"" and ""Taxi Driver."" Griffin Dunne is Paul Hacket, a computer programmer who is just going through the motions and has an empty social life. He strikes up a conversation with a nice lady named Marcy (Rosanna Arquette) at a local restaurant over a novel they've both read. Words are exchanged. So are looks. She seems interested. He's hooked. And from the split-second he gets into that cab, the nightmare begins. The cab blows like mad through the busy streets of downtown SoHo. And after his transportation money literally goes out the window, so do Paul's chance of getting home. He has no idea how deep he's in. At first, it just seems like he's the victim of some bad luck. He encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours. Unpleasant night owls, severe misunderstandings and eventually the next thing he knows, poor Paul is running for his very life.He encounters a lot on those dark streets after hours. Unpleasant night owls, severe misunderstandings and eventually the next thing he knows, poor Paul is running for his very life.Now many of you may be asking, ""Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is a thriller? Is it a horror show?"" Yes. It's... it's like a dream about something that really happened to you. It all plays out like a dream about ""the strangest night of my life...."" And everyone's had that one long, weird night where they were stranded somewhere.... just stuck. No money, no ride. And all the weirdos and sickos all come out from their hiding-places. ""They only come out at night,"" as they say.I don't want to give too much away because this is a movie where surprise after surprise. There's a whole domino effect here as everything leads to a big final act where we fear for Paul and his safety, and our own. Because it feels like we have become Paul.The movie features a first-rate all-star cast. Rosanna Arquette, Verna Bloom, Tommy Chong, Linda Fiorentino Teri Garr, John Heard, Cheech Marin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Miller, Will Patton, Robert Plunket and Bronson Pinchot. This is the most surprising thing to come from Martin Scorsese. Scorsese has been somewhat pigeon-holed as a director, making usually historical bio-pics about true-life Jewish/Itallian Immigrants growing up in the Bronx and embarking on a life of crime. Always operatic, always rich with detail. ""After Hours"" is the arrival of a new Scorsese. One who shows a frightening ""what if?"" story in the Big Apple involving anyone with a big-city nightlife.If it wasn't for Scorsese's name in the credits, you'd never guess he was at the helm. You'd never imagine in a million years he ever had anything to do with the project. He uses a quiet, subtle feeling the movie has when it's... ""too quiet"" and the pumped-up feeling during the more intense dramatic scenes. Scorsese is a master of suspense, mood and timing. The fact that the Academy continues to pass him for an Oscar time and time and time again is not only annoying. It's downright offensive. We all know too damn well that the Academy bases Oscars all on politics. Well, as far as I'm concerned, Scorsese has played by all the rules. His films are very well-made and intellectual. They have a graceful operatic feel to them. They are often all-too historically accurate bio-pics. And it uses it. Every actor is perfectly cast. Everyone is allowed to stand out in a big way without being too contrived or too cartoonish to be real. And Scorsese, who's name stands for quality above all others, makes the most of it.Joseph Minion's screenplay (which he collaborated with Scorsese on) is used for all it's worth. All the characters are quirky, colorful, yet realistic. The dialog is smart and honest without being too unnaturally ""screenwriter-ishly clever."" And 9 out of 10 New Yorkers who see this movie will smile and nod, ""Yep. That's NYC at night to a T."" Everyone else will be sure to avoid New York like a severe audit. Most people who live outside New York fear the city and plan never to go there. I imagine this movie will do a lot to complete the trend. My only real complaint is that Minion should have gotten more credit for his original and winning screenplay. He should have gotten maybe a few more nods from other academies, I'd never seen anything so intriguing and elaborate before. It's not just new. It's smart, fresh, well-crafted and all-too believable. I know the American Academy would give an Oscar nomination to a film like this, but that's almost a sign of it's greatness. Scorsese gives it a realistic, yet outrageous feel and knows how to let the suspense draw out and build skillfully and Joseph Minion has written himself a little bitty treasure. I just wish he'd write so much more. Still, this is a home run on every account. I say this and mean it: YOU ALL MUST SEE THIS MOVIE.

111,xtian_durden,Remarkably Underrated,9,26 July 2017,"A minor work from Scorsese, but remarkably underrated. This mid-80s film is an exercise of style and pure filmmaking from a director who was frustrated when his passion project was delayed again and again. Instead of letting his own disappointments absorb him, he focused all his energy in this low-budget dark comedy about one man's incredibly disappointing and ill-fated night in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. Working with skillful German cinematographer Michael Ballhaus (a frequent collaborator of R.W. Fassbinder), the film was shot at night with a feeling of strange perplexity and a sense of paranoia that had occupied not only the effective actor Griffin Dunne but also the viewers, using crafty camera improvisations to make that effect.The film is thoroughly engaging and it works like a dream – it has no intention of explaining itself, and as the title suggests; it is meant to be watched after midnight.",After Hours
112,OllieZ,Scorcese's most underrated.,9,21 December 2004,"Out of all the Scorsese films - I would have to admit this ranks in the top five. After Hours draws you into it's dark and surreal world with fantastical wonder. The characters are all interesting, the acting superb - especially Griffin Dunne - and the pacing is great.It was made in 1985, and I can already see the techniques Scorsese used in Goodfellas - and the quick editing. It is directed and edited really well. So if you were a fan of Scorsese's frantic camera work in Goodfellas and Casino, this film is for you.It really does put you on edge - as a viewer, you really want Dunne's character to get back home - but everything possible that could happen to him - happens. This is not just a evocation of soHo in the early 80's - it is a deeply black comedy. All the rules go out the window for Dunne's character, because after all it is after hours.Scorsese really is the best living director at the moment - so do yourself a favour and watch this movie - it's fantastic.",After Hours

That appears to be Paul Hackett's problem in this film. Today is just not his day. He begins the day with the usual routine, then he meets a pretty girl at a diner and she invites him to her apartment. That's when everything goes down hill. From that moment on the film becomes an HILARIOUS comedy by director Martin Scorsese. He is a gifted director, so he knows how to push the right buttons and make us pity the character. However, at the same time we must laugh because in a way we can relate to Hackett. Even though his problems are extreme we cannot forget that this is a satire. So, no matter how extreme his situation is we can still laugh at it because we can relate it to our own bad days.RATING: 4 stars (****)",After Hours

While I don't recall it being 2 hours 22 minutes, I still think what I saw was longer than an hour and a half.

115,R-P-McMurphy,Late night troubles,10,6 July 2013,"""After Hours"" is a 1985 American black comedy directed by Martin Scorsese (Goodfellas, Taxi Driver).A New York office worker has a very strange night when he goes on a late night date with a woman he just met, which turns into nightmare when one bizarre problem after another strands him in a hostile neighborhood in his quest to return home before morning.""After Hours"" is a brilliant film, its a perfect midnight movie, date movie, stoner movie, light movie, comedy-horror movie, quirky movie, but most of all its a fun movie.I think its also a very influential film. It has directing and cinematography very similar to Wes Anderson movies, which might be the reason why Scorsese called him ""The next Martin Scorsese"" and coming to think about it, Wes Anderson used the same type of music in ""Bottle Rocket"" and had James Caan's introduce himself the same way as a character in this movie (the sculptor girl that lives with the main character's date).The movie is a segment of strange occurrences, similar to what happens to all the characters in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"". I also found the dinner scenes with the main character's date to be similar to the dinner scene in Pulp Fiction, but maybe thats just me.Apart from comparing it to other movies, the performances are great, the story is unexpected, I loved that Cheech and Chong are in it and I also enjoyed Martin Scorsese's Alfred Hitchcock- like cameo in it.I believe this is a classic because a movie like this could not be made today, because of the technology that exists. If they were to remake this it would all end within 10 minutes thanks to a phone call.I'd recommend it to people who liked ""Midnight in Paris"", ""The Hangover"", ""Being John Malkovich"", ""The Tenant"", ""Roger Dodger"" or ""The Big Lebowski"".",After Hours

121,FSfilmblog,underrated and unseen,9,10 February 2011,"A little known film directed by the great Martin Scorsese, released between The King of Comedy (1982) and The Color of Money (1985), It was another one of his forays into the comedy genre. Though it isn't a straight comedy, it is very offbeat and blackly comical in tone and situations. It zips along at such breathless pace you just don't know what's going to happen from one scene to another. It's a shame that only Crime/Gangster genre seems to be his regular output of films of late and that you can see a marvellous and assured piece of comedic genius on display in this picture.Griffin Dunne (An American Werewolf in London) stars as Paul, a mild mannered office worker in the New York. One night in a coffee shop, he has a chance encounter with Marcy (Roseanna Arquette), a kooky strange character whom he gets her phone number off (he pretends to be interested in buying her friends sculptural work...), and he decides to contact her later that night. His impulsive behaviour leads him to a night he will never forget.On the phone she tells him to come up to see her and so off he goes in what he hopes to be a night of passion but when he gets in the cab, that's when his troubles begin. As the taxi cab zips around the streets of New York, the kinetic camera work and fast paced editing leads us into a whole series of weird and wonderful characters and situations. Whenever you think things can't go wrong for Paul, things take a turn for the worst. His first mishaps occurs when his money flies out of the cab...thus leaving him with no cash to get home.His supposed date goes awry and he leaves on a sour note, he tries to make his way home but fate has other plans for him. With each and every character he encounters, he gets more and more embroiled and increasingly irate at his inability to find a way home. Everyone he comes across has a slightly askew view on his situation (or not really paying him much sympathy to his plight) and he ends up upsetting or offending them. The only man to offer any sign of help is the bartender but unfortunately he turns out to be Marcy boyfriend, which leads to more complications. As the night wears on, you wonder how he gets out of his predicament. Does he make it back home....well you just have to wait and see.Griffin Dunne display the right amount of paranoia and anguish. The supporting cast play their parts well and the numerous quirky characters all come across just on the right side of believability. From the waitress (Teri Garr) to the ice cream van owner Gail (Catherine O'Hara), they all display a little bit of kooky craziness. The only sane one is probably Tom (John Heard) the bartender even then, he can't help our protagonist (we even get Cheech and Chong in on the act as a pair incompetent of burglars).With such a remarkable and resounding weird look into New Yorks' bizarre night life it's like a story you get hooked into and watch to see the madness unfold with ever evolving situation. Scorsese fabulously captures the stranger side of New York and is brilliant lit up by Michael Ballhaus cinematography (It was their first collaboration together and they have gone on since to make Last Temptation of Christ, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York amongst others). The quick speed in which the film took to complete is what Scorsese was aiming for. His latter films became a long and arduous shoot and this film harks back to his early methods and it's not overblown or over polished. It's a wild and wondrous ride which still feels as fresh and unique as it did when it first came on to our screens.if you like my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com/",After Hours

123,doire,Potential plot hole?,9,13 November 2010,"**POTENTIAL SPOILERS**. Though I am not sure if Paul is well-off or not, not knowing how much a computer programmer would have earned circa 1985 - his apartment does look a little sparse - he is still able to take $20.00 with him on his trip down to SoHo, $20.00 being, I should imagine, quite a sum in 1985. So when his money disappears out the window of the cab - the ride downtown costing something like $6.00 - then why didn't Paul, (as a supposedly honest man), ask the driver to take him back to his apartment so that he could have gotten some more money and been able to pay him in full rather than making - what must have seemed to the taxi-driver like a lame excuse? Or are we to insinuate that Paul was down to his last $20.00? Or didn't want to risk going back and risk missing the appointed time for his rendezvous with the wonderful Arquette character? If he had gone back home he might just have saved himself a lot of bother - but then again, probably not. Still, when we accept that this man is desperate to get back home, why couldn't he have just hopped in a cab and paid when he did eventually get home? He was able to get a cab to SoHo without paying, so why couldn't he have just reversed the process? It is not at though he is totally honest, after all. He had previously tried to ride the tube home free when he found that he hadn't enough money to pay the (just-raised) fare and I know he did try to hail a cab home ONCE, offering to pay with the $20.00 bill he had removed (stolen) from the paper maché model, but he never thinks of hailing another cab after this money is stolen, in turn, from him by a less than happy taxi-driver!

As he tries to find the money to take the subway home, he meets several interesting and sometimes very strange people.Dunne's character seems to be the only normal person in this film and that is one of the reasons why it works so well. This poor guy just wants to get home, but problem after problem pops up and destroys his plans. This is really a terrific story about a normal person thrown into weird and crazy situations. The classical music that plays throughout is a wonderful touch as well. However, one of my favorite parts of this film was the cast.

125,TheFilmFreak1,A Scorcese Comedy Doesn't Sound Right for a Reason,7,19 January 2012,"Martin Scorsese's idiosyncratic 'After Hours' is, if nothing else, an interesting film. It explores thematic and visual avenues that most films would barely dream of exploring. Regrettably, it chooses to pursue these avenues through comedic means rather than dramatic or thrilling quasi-philosophical ones, which is highly detrimental toward any effort to maintain the paramount stable of great comedy: that every single scene and story element must have some type of structural or humorous payoff. This is not always necessary with thrillers or epics (though it is certainly beneficial), but with comedies it is absolutely mandatory. It is arguably the cinematic equivalent of telling a joke well; no matter how witty or inherently funny the concepts that are addressed within the gag are, the transference of the joke teller's understanding of the humorous merit of those concepts will only be actuated successfully if every cadence (camera shot), pause (edit), and phonetic (actor) involved in the regalement is predetermined with tremendous precision. Frankly, Scorsese just wasn't up to the task.The editing is just absurdly ostentatious. We're not even ten seconds into the film before over two dozen shots are thrown at us. Once again, if this was some type of Nicholas Roeg-esque Lovecraftian Horror film (or a pop-political conspiracy movie), that would all fine and dandy, but this is a midnight Kafkaesque cringe comedy – an emotionally disturbed 'Out-of-Towners', if you will –; we're not supposed to get a headache until the third act! It was a sign of Scorsese' declining adeptness as a filmmaker, really, and it is perhaps the recognition of these tragic auspices of directorial ineptitude that make the film just that little bit harder to watch. Yet, while the editing is distracting, 'After Hours' is no 'Cape Fear (1991)'.The screenplay brazenly borders the line between Daedalian farce and abrasive pointlessness, revealing its amateurish design with every plot turn (though more frequently 'plot contrivance') and development. By no means aiding the credibility of the script is the fact that the writer, Joseph Minion, plagiarised a good deal of the damn thing (some esoteric comedian's standup routine was the primary fatality). There are flashes of genius in it, of course (a cash register key is a surprisingly efficient plot device), but the lack of polish is really quite repellent at times.I suppose 'After Hours' is successful at being a work of particularly grim jocularity, but it is essentially the cinematic equivalent of a joke without a punchline. With less Kafka and more farcical frivolity, the end product might have been an open-ended joke of a more satisfying mould.",After Hours
126,jonnycof,An amazing rabbit hole of a film,9,8 June 2019,"A quirky, well written comedy. The events of this script are expertedly woven together and beautifully presented by Scorsese as always. His style of filmmaking is as prevalent here as any of his gritty crime flicks. The acting is superb, Griffin Dunne does a great job of playing the frustrated every man and it's a cast studded with 80s regulars. I was particularly fascinated by Roxanne Arquette's performance but all of the supporting cast did an excellent job.What a film! Ranks among Scorsese's best for me.",After Hours

128,wezzel,After Hours,7,21 February 2002,"Starting and finishing with one on the most hypnotising and exciting cameramovements in history, After Hours is vintage Scorsese. This is a movie that almost fysically hurts to watch. You get so drawn in to the situation that it feels like it's you stuck there with all the freaks SoHo can buy.Griffin Dunne is excellent as the everydayman who goes out for a night on the town. The movie keeps on balancing between funny and tragic, it never falls and the situations have enough realism to keep you on the edge of your seat. This is simply a story about a guy having the worst night of his life.Rating: 7.5/10Most Memorable Movie Moment: Griffin Dunne trying to make a phonecall at Catherine O'Hara's place.",After Hours
129,ShempMyMcMalley,"New York, New York!",8,30 July 2008,"'After hours' is classic Scorsese. Young word-processing specialist Paul Hackett, bored of his job, meets a beautiful young lady and gets her number. Later he calls her and treks across town from his posh Eastside NYC apartment to SoHo, in a wry comedic, often nightmarish journey that seemingly won't end, with encounters from a bevy of odd and disenfranchised characters. 'After Hours' is a Kafkaesque nightmare, slightly noirish, and is embodied with Scorsese's signature flares with the camera. These include a P.O.V. shot for a set of falling keys from the keys' perspective and many other, better seen than explained. The direction tight, you may become exhausted with the plight of Paul in just this night. It is said that Scorsese took on this project after the studio shut down his production of ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" just a few days before cameras were to roll. Well, Paul Hackett, possibly, was to Martin Scorsese at that point: ineffectual in changing his circumstances. Through Hackett, Scorsese could seek to expel his disdain.",After Hours
130,QoS007,Scorsese Goes Indie,10,14 July 2008,"After financial problems involving The Last Temptation of Christ, Martin Scorsese was left at a crossroads. Had he decided not to do After Hours, we may never have seen hide nor hair from him again. As for it's ranking in the legendary Scorsese film collection? Among the highest. This underrated masterpiece is the very movie that got me addicted to independent films in the first place.The setting: mid-80's, pre-Rudolph Giulianni era New York City.The story introduces us to Paul Hackett (Griffin Dunne), who works in the daytime as a low-level, word processor. One night, on an unusual impulse, Paul travels to the SoHo District in Manhattan. He lands at an all-night coffee shop where he meets Marcy Franklin (Rosanna Arquette), who proves to also be a night owl. By receiving Marcy's phone number, Paul sets off a series of strange and cataclysmic events that forever alter his night senses.The film has many great supporting actors such as John Heard as the late night bar keep, Catherine O' Hara as the riot monger, and Linda Fiorentino as Marcy's artsy, mysterious roommate.After Hours is a wonderful film from start to finish, and is a must see for die-hard Scorsese fans.

It is filled with intriguingly bizzare characters (played by an eclectic cast) that really shows what big city paranoia is all about.  For everyone who has had ""one of those days"", check this movie out and see what a bad day is REALLY like.  Scorsese also has quite a bit of fun with the camera, so take that Dramamine first.  Oh yeah, and it's HILARIOUS...that is if you find suicide and blood-thirsty mobs funny.

133,Mr Blue-4,Still Great After All These Years,10,17 September 2004,"I saw this when this first came out about 19 (!) years ago, and it became my favorite movie of 1985, and probably my favorite Scorsese film (""Goodfellas"" is right there with it). However it always seemed that I was the only one who felt that way. It was no sensation at the box office (even by art film standards), it was ignored by all the awards as far as I remember, and no DVD release.Until now. First off, I am happy to report that the new DVD release looks and sounds great. It feels like the film came out last year.Now, years down the road, you really appreciate how accomplished ""After Hours"" is in the wake of 100s of inferior indie releases that ape the urban paranoia and ""downtown"" sensibility that this seems to effortlessly catch. The film is pitch perfect:you sense a filmmaker in complete command, but the film is always off balance (as intended). The plot seems to flow randomly and the movie always defies your expectations, yet it's as tightly assembled as a jigsaw puzzle.It's easy to catch the Scorsese style of shooting and editing, really starting to roll here (before taking off in ""The Color of Money"" and ""Goodfellas""), as the engine of the movie. You have to remind yourself that every other director was not trying to make movies this way at this point (1985), and that you are watching the inventor, not just the best practitioner.But don't overlook the cast's contributions. Perfectly cast down to the smallest roles (yes, I mean you Dick Miller), few things are more enjoyable than watching an able cast take the ball and run with it. Obviously having a blast, they not only jump into their parts, but they have no hesitation at being unlikable and annoying. Particularly Griffin Dunne, the perfect Everyman, who becomes more and more of a jerk as the night wears on.",After Hours

135,TheSteelHelmetReturns,One of my top ten favourite films.,10,1 October 2009,"The eighties was the best decade for Scorsese with every film being just full of energy but still having the restraint to focus on the story of one person's eventual downfall and/or redemption – Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, After Hours, The Color of Money and The Last Temptation of Christ. After Hours is my favourite Scorsese picture because it is Scorsese at is his most Lynch-esquire surreal and it is a huge deviation from his Godard influenced style. Not only that, the structure of the story as you follow this one man just run into more excruciating situations that all logically flow into each other is, not only funny, but admirable from a writing standpoint. I wince but also enjoy seeing Griffin Dunne, who seems like a live action Leisure Suit Larry, just fail and it's the great kind of movie where you watch really late on a Saturday night – explaining its cult status. There are also a number of great cameos by performers just before they became well known in the nineties and I am so glad I have a movie on this list featuring one of the female Arquettes.",After Hours

After viewing After Hours, I've concluded that this film ranked right up there as being supremely funny and entertaining.A simple date at Soho gone wrong, that's basically the whole premise of the film. The main character went through unexpected events one after another. Along the way many weird people popped up as the time goes on. My favorite scenes include the moments between Paul and the bartender, and moments with Kiki. This is not a film with deep philosophical messages, it's simply a film to laugh out loud with.

Just thinking about the film, which I last saw about 10 years ago, gives me a feeling of longing in the pit of my stomach. I've never lived in NYC, but I often thought of moving there in my younger days, and this film really captures the reason why.Griffin Dunne sort of reminds me of myself in those days. He is a typical young guy, out for a night, sampling the city. It's easy to relate to him, and we really feel for him, worry about him, and laugh at and with him. His performance is superb.

The movie itself tries to show the nuance of the night in urban area of America. In the movie, you can see Scorsese's cameo appearance in the scene when Paul is try to meet Marcy and Daren (his friends)in the punk nightclub, when Paul is tried to be balded. Scorsese is seen playing the spotlight for a few seconds. Yes, it is a quite light entertaining feature from Scorsese. It's witty and comical. It has aspects of black comedy, and in the end of the movie, I'm sure you gonna smile on it. I can not find any essential weakness in this movie, but it's also not anchoring in my mind.

It wasn't till years later he realized it was a Scorsese movie.The movie came in the WB Box Set released with Goodfellas, Mean Streets, and a few other of the filmmakers lesser known, earlier films. I was happy when I finally popped After Hours into the DVD player, it is a darkly funny, well written downtown New York Adventure.Hackett meets Marcy in a café, who passes her number off to him. Clearly a bored word processor seeking adventure, Hackett calls Marcy, who invites him over, he peers at his watch, 11:30pm, and his night has just begun. So begin's his crazy adventure, meeting peculiar character after peculiar character. The theme of the movie is that the whole world is different after midnight, from the people who inhabit it, to the rules which govern it.Hackett has lost his money, and is so far from his home uptown, that he is virtually stuck in Soho.

I'm sure I am the problem, I just didn't love watching it. If you watch a lot of movies, have a lot of time and are interested in a movie where the point is to appreciate it's cutting-edgeness of the time, this may be for you.

I have a feeling that because this might be one of his least accessible films to current audiences, people just call it his most 'underrated'. In fact, there's a reason it isn't talked about much, because it is rubbish. Here Scorsese seems like he's built up his reputation strongly enough so he can just put out any old tosh and audiences will praise it to high heaven just because Scorsese directed it. The directing is lazy, the plot at first glance seems interesting enough but Scorsese does his best to bring it down and ends up with a stretched, repetitive, sequence of encounters with various deadbeats, and lowlife losers, which we are apparently supposed to show some interest in. Griffin Dunne is just to waspy and bland for us to invest any time in caring for his character. The film just doesn't stop attempting to prepare us for tension and excitement and building up these encounters and situations before resulting in a huge anti-climax and more stretched out, aimless roads to nowhere.",After Hours

I thought it started out great - drawing you in - making you think it's going to be an enjoyable comedy/mystery roller-coaster ride, but some very slow scenes further into the movie without any kind of payoff were a big turnoff, and it devolved from there.

The lead character is very easy to sympathise with as he takes on a night of events which grow progressively worse. The characters are unique to the movie and each interesting in their way. Humour comes from the 'wtf' moments when our relatively grounded protagonists has to deal with incredibly strange people and things going on around him.Where the movie falls over is in its pacing. Too often dialogue will drag on, line deliveries will take twice the time they need to, and frankly scenes just play out much more longer than they need to. 30 minutes could easily be cut from this movie with more concise editing.Ultimately the interesting but slow narrative culminated in a kind of morbid curiosity for us.

150,theclintdavis,Long night's journey into day,8,17 April 2020,"Martin Scorsese has always been a master of kinetic filmmaking but After Hours is really where he starts cranking up the energy even more. This movie is simply alive in a way that most movies aren't. Everyone in it has a story to tell and we're ready to hear them all.From the cocktail waitress who seems stuck in the 1960s to the ice cream truck driver who wears a rape whistle to the stoic bouncer outside the punk bar and of course the sculptor who lives under the bar and has no scruples about using live subjects, there are so many weirdos in this film it's fantastic.I've seen plenty of New York movie but I'm not sure I've ever seen any make the city feel so oppressively large. There's a great sense of space in this film and it genuinely feels hopeless for Paul to try to get home, which could sound like a dumb premise for a movie until you see it handled here. The journey is downright epic and Scorsese uses every visual technique he learned in school to keep the tempo cruising through this long trip.I wasn't bored for a second at any point during After Hours and you won't be either. This film is alive and Thelma Schoonmaker does maybe the best work of her great career at an editing bay. She should've gotten an Oscar nomination. This film is simply a master class in pacing.",After Hours

Paul tries, fails and finds himself recommitting the same errors that created his predicament ---- his nightmare happened because he didn't go to sleep he went out. Paul cannot seem to untwist himself from the odd assortment of characters, lowlifes, psychos and sociopaths that seem to inhabit Marcy's SoHo neighborhood nor does he understand that to them he is the oddball.Scorcese's foray into the black comedy genre is darkly funny and worth renting for a break from the usual.

It gets under your skin -- it's a tale of paranoia that seems retro-geared from the mid '80s for our time -- and, at the same time, it's still as laugh out loud funny as when I first saw it during its original release. I've never been to New York City but Scorsese's best, ""Taxi Driver"", not as damning in its '70s milieu as people think, -- and Letterman's Late Night and years of SNL as well as Woody Allen and Spike Lee -- make me love the particularity of the city in a cool, detached way but ""After Hours"" has a weird universality to it, too. It's a voyage to get back home, hampered by beautiful, crazy women, frustrated gay men, hostile cab drivers, toll-takers, thieves, burly bartenders, performance artists, punks, and a vigilante mob lead by a Mr. Softee ice cream truck; a journey confused by protagonist Paul Hackett's conflicting drives and desires and sensibilities. This is comedy as nightmare and yet you believe in every second -- and it's all the more nightmarish. ""I just wanted to meet a girl"", implores Paul, ""And now I've got to die for it!?"". Stripped down and bare boned as compared with Mr. Scorsese's more acclaimed work, he provides (along with a perfect cast, a smart-eyed shooter, and his usual whip-smart cutter) a picture that stays with you and that you'll watch again and again -- especially when the world around you grows too weird.",After Hours

157,apocalypse_ciao,"After Hours is a weird, spooky, and entertaining movie.",10,19 August 2006,"I actually remember seeing the poster for After Hours displayed at The Vista when it played there back in 1985. It kind of freaked me out to see Griffin Dunnes's head being twisted like the crank of a pocket watch, yikes! I didn't see it though, I wish I did, but I was more into GoBots back then and saw movies with my parents and they weren't into those types of films I guess. Besides the Z Channel, the cable channels during the early to mid 1980's in L. A., never really catered to the off beat, underground, or art-house flicks. Independent cinema was still a largely underground thing until the 90's. So it was a year later on cable that I first viewed Scorcese's highly underrated yet, wonderfully black comedy ""After Hours"", in 1986. It seemed really out of place in what I normally saw on cable.While watching the movie my emotional reaction went from either laughter to this gray area of tension that something worse was just around the corner for Griffin Dunne's character. It broke a lot of taboos for me. It was the first movie I saw where someone who used drugs, smoked a joint, wasn't a hippie, rather a yuppie. The first time I saw references to punk rock culture, first time I heard Peggy Lee's ""Is that all there is?"", and the first time I saw a movie so unpredictably charming and creepy, but that wasn't in a blood and guts horror genre, but was more like an urban nightmare for a working class hero.I remember hoping that Griffin Dunne's character would make it home in one piece. Those scenes filmed in Marcy's, Rosanna Arquette's character, loft so stuck with me, the weird rape story where Arquette is rather stoic when talking about it in detail, the dimly lit studio, Linda Fiorentino sporting a mullet looking hairdo, the book Paul opens up of burn victims, and him busting down the door after discovering she od'd on sleeping pills and falling flat on his back are memorable. Teri Garr's character was at first so seemingly angelic and takes a turn for the worst, so bitingly ruthless and vengeful all because of Paul's refusal at her sexual advances. Cheech and Chong make a cameo as well.I also want to note that Howard Shore does an amazing job on the score. The music accompanies Dunne's treacherous pilgrimage home through dark SoHo streets beautifully and accentuates the eeriness of his mishaps.Whether intentional or not, ""After Hours"" and Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"", were probably only a couple of the few movies that broke through the veneer of 80's Reaganism and excess, not excluding Jim Jarmusch's ""Stranger than Paradise"". I was fortunate to see a showing of ""After Hours"" this past year at the New Beverly Cinema and was just blown away by it.So, that in a nutshell, is why I like this film and can watch it again and again and it gets my nervous system all jumpy...but in a good way : )",After Hours

159,dnjjr,Scorcese's Brilliant Black Comedy,9,18 February 2006,"N.B. Spoilers within.This is an underrated, sublimely realized black comedy by the (at the time) struggling Scorcese. There is a perfect balance here between the big picture-uptown white-collar insurance guy out of his league in night-time bohemian SoHo-and infinite numbers of details within. Scorcese has taken a great script by Joseph Minion and crafted a piece of comedy, suspense, self-exploration, plenty of twists, and interpersonal discovery. Our lead, Paul Hackett (the subtle and brilliant Griffin Dunne) is the most hapless ""hero"" to grace the screen in a long time. Whatever can go wrong does go wrong. As Paul steps into the next venture, there is no telling what will come of it. The script keeps the viewer constantly on edge and clueless as to what to expect next. Paranoia becomes rampant.The music that frames the picture-a youthful symphony by Mozart-defines the outwardly tidy guidelines of Paul's world (number crunching and computer interfacing). But even the small glimpse we get of that world says that all is not right. The trainee whom Paul is overseeing (a small part for Bronson Pinchot-see ""True Romance"") hates the job and wants out of it. Then there is that telling moment where Paul looks around him and watches everything flow by in its idiosyncratic motion. The quick vision is both sexy and unsettling. He's having a momentary insight, but exactly into what? Is his whole life here empty and pointless? Is he bored out of his mind? Scorcese never lets us know for sure. But then Paul meets Marcy in the diner and the fun begins.We can't know if Murphy's Law applies to Paul all the time, but it certainly does on this fateful night. There is a flat-out poetic shot of Paul's sole 20-dollar bill floating from the cab into oblivion, and this is just the beginning. This brings up my first observation, though, on Scorcese: his stunning and beautiful camera work. It flows, it jumps, it's liquid, now it interrupts jarringly. The whole effort contributes to the anxious nature of the story and of how Paul never feels completely grounded while he's out of his territory.The multitudes of characters that Paul meets are all convoluted stories unto themselves. Kiki (a smoking-hot Linda Fiorentino-where has she gone?), Marcy's artist roommate, and the ultimate 80s bohemian; her leather-bound friend Horst (a menacing Will Patton); the ""nice"" waitress (Teri Garr) with more baggage than Paul can handle; Gail (the hilarious Catherine O'Hara) who will turn on Paul in a big way; Tom the bartender (John Heard), himself a ticking time-bomb; Cheech and Chong, industrious through the long night, and the solution to who the bad SoHo burglars are; but especially there's Marcy (the luscious Rosanna Arquette). She is sweet, good-hearted, ditsy, but full of dark secrets. A lot of these are spilled, others only suggested. The rape story, for example...hard to understand until you've seen it, but it's full of comedy. Arquette plays Marcy just right, a girl who is just short of being completely unhinged, but who still stumbles ahead smoothly and confidently if not a good bit clueless-ly. This is one unique character. Her suicide contributes much to Paul's emotional weight-how exactly did he contribute to it?-and also to the comedy's being so black.""After Hours"" occupies an era that is pre-ATMs and cell phones, but there are Checker cabs, subway tokens, gritty artists' lofts, and rotary phones. Punk is king. The picture strikes me as being linear, yes, but also kaleidoscopic: Paul meets and re-meets the same characters throughout, but each time this happens, his circumstances have taken a new turn. The story is also full of strange details that help knit the whole together. An example: the subject of burns and scars. There is this brief focus on burns and burn treatments. Marcy's cream, her trip to the drugstore to get it, the book of gruesome pictures that Paul can't keep himself from...then Marcy floats back in (he slams the book shut) and what is she holding? A candle with a huge flame! Ha! It's details like these that make the movie feel so integrated. (Even Kiki tells Paul she has ""horrible, ugly scars."") Finally, and this part is truly sick, once Marcy is dead under the sheet, Paul can't help but inspect her body for those suspected burn marks. Ugh I have to mention the last of Paul's meetings, when there is absolutely nowhere else to turn: June, at the club (Verna Bloom), seems to be the only person who truly understands his predicament and who helps to finally ""rescue"" him, but her means are highly suspicious. Is she also trying to kill him? What a stroke. One of the key themes of the flick is that everyone Paul encounters is for the moment his savior, but who soon leads him into more trouble than he already has. It is Paul/Upper East Side/trying-his-best versus the nighttime/living-on-the-fly/Downtown mentality, and ""After Hours"" places the two mindsets at opposite ends of the universe.Scorcese, temporarily abandoning the beleaguered ""Last Temptation,"" hit the mark spot-on with this wonderful comedy. In the process he proved his love for the medium, not to mention loving all the memorable characters that inhabit the wacky, unpredictable story. I also think this is Griffin Dunne's pinnacle: he perfectly inhabits a role where everything is falling apart around him but where he hangs on and finds something inside that keeps plugging on until the sun rises again. Polished, inspired, funny, and disturbing film making. Highly recommended.",After Hours

After Hours is not typical Scorsese fare and one reason it works is because of the legendary filmmaker's deft skills- the atmosphere is amazing as is the pacing of the film. The protagonist is relatable in an everyman lost and confused kind of way. Like a bad dream or surreal experience After Hours is one hell of a ride.

The plot isn't much, the acting is okay, the lighting, camera work and general mood is workmanlike, no disgrace. BUT The whole is weak, boring and ultimately pointless. The lingering feeling throughout the film is the sense of injustice, in being trapped in circumstances beyond your control, being forever dragged from pillar to post, the end obscured. But why? Because everyone he meets in the film is a little crazy, acts irrationally and seems to be out to spite him a little. There's no cohesion to it, no reason for all these people behaving so strangely except for some 'noo-yorkers are K-RAzy' concept which doesn't suffice for engendering any real tension. Also, the aim is an amusing little story but because of this constant need to try to create tension there are no laughs, just these odd blank spaces in the film where a laugh should be but which, instead, is a lightening of the more general mood.

Are we watching the same movie? Because the movie I saw had a fairly odious protagonist, a supporting cast that existed solely to be ridiculed, a series of 'crazy' events befalling our 'hapless' protagonist that exist nowhere on the reality continuum, and seemed to have been invented by a corp committee composed of former frat 'dudes' pitching ideas for 'worst night ever' that aren't funny and mostly don't even make sense. Most (all?) of the 'crazy' people whom whatever the guys name is meets in his 'romp' thru nyc are women, who proceed to beguile him with their alluring sex appeal (with the exception of poor Teri Garr, who for some reason is made out to be some pathetic spinster... or something...) only to send him running once they reveal their true 'scary' woman-personalities. Isn't that always the way of it?? This movie is sexist, stupid, unlikeable, unfunny and makes little to no sense. Madcap is one thing. This is more like nocap.

I love the whole bizarre set up, the weird coincidences (for example the piece of newspaper stuck on his arm which talks about a man being ripped apart by vigilantes in the very area he can't get away from - and then the weird woman says 'I'll burn it off' - yet more reference to burns) Love the 'Berlin club', and the idea of the plaster of Paris cream cheese bagel paper weights - so evocative of that pretentious era!

She gets some of the funniest lines in the movie and the awkward tension between her and Paul set a great tone for the film.

168,m-narmin,Scorsese's wildest nightmare,8,7 October 2018,"Reviews on the ""After hours"" are quite different, but here it is: once in a couple of years we see a nightmare of being stock in a never ending circle and don't know how to get out of it, but unless other nightmares this very dream turns out to be so adventurous, that it leaves a bitter sweet aftertaste once we wake up and tell about it to our friends. 
I think Scorsese had a similar nightmare right before he came up with the idea of the ""After hours"" movie.
In spite of all the weirdness and troubles the main character goes through during one night, the movie itself is quite watchable thanks to Scorsese's magical skill of creating action and fun wherever possible and impossible.
Oh, and the MOST important part is as follows: for one hour straight I've been thinking ""what for God's sake it reminds me of? Have I watched this movie before?"" Then, Catherine O'Hara appeared and lights turned on in my brain's memory card: BEETLEJUICE!

It makes you grateful that you are an actual person and not a fictional character!,10,11 June 2000,"I must have seen this film over a dozen times.  Every time I get something else from it.  It's the little touches that do it for me......like when Paul is resigning himself into seeking sanctuary with Julie, so he goes to the gents to wash his face, and there on the wall, like a sign from God, is a drawing of a shark eating a mans dick.There is a big play on sods law, that leaves the viewer empathising with Paul, thinking yes - that did/could/almost happen(ed) to me!It just keeps on getting blacker and blacker.  The rule in general is that everything that can go wrong will and therefore does - only much worse than you anticipated.  Even Paul begins to sense this and falls to his knees in the street crying ""What do you want from me God, I'm just a Word Processor for Christ's sake!"".Watch what's going on the the background closely (tip - never look away from the screen) the director even does a brief Hitchcock type appearance.This film is best watched in the dark, the whole atmosphere is similar to the night time sequences in 'Taxi Driver' with the street lights reflecting in the puddles etc.One of the key points is that the action takes place over a  12-16 hour period, reminiscent of 'Bad Day at Black Rock'.  This keeps it tightly paced, and it feels longer than it actually is, but never ever dull!I can't think of another film that is similar, the only thing that remotely springs to mind is 'American Werewolf in London'.Not everyone will like this film - and you don't have to like Scorsese films to like this, it's 'Scorsese light'.

One of my top 10 all time greats up there on my personal favourites list with the likes of Jaws, Halloween, Pulp Fiction, Enter The Dragon, Weird Science, The Devil Rides Out, Grease, The Craft, American Werewolf In London & A Clockwork Orange.Yet it is unlike any of them. This is a dark, amusing, sometimes uncomfortable and paranoid story of a young office worker Paul (Dunne), who finds himself in increasingly bizarre situations as the night goes on. It all starts when he meets a young woman in a café (Arquette) and ends up calling her to procure a cream cheese & plaster-of-Paris bagel paperweight. He ends up as a wanted man by a whole neighbourhood through chance, coincidence and, more often, sheer bad luck.I can't say enough about this film - it is a truly overlooked gem of the movie world. Griffin Dunne's character, Paul, often reminds me of Patrick Macgoohan's 'No.2' from the exceptional Prisoner series.I find this film is best watched in the small hours, on your own, in the dark, with a nice bottle of wine.

177,arvidarontroeng,An often overlooked masterpiece,10,24 October 2014,"For many years this movie, together with a few others, formed my view of NYC as a mysterious, adventurous, and dangerous place. Although not as gritty and threatening as the Manhattan seen in Taxi Driver or Serpico or even The Warriors, there is a similar feeling in this movie that anything may happen and that downtown is not safe during after hours. After Hours does not take place during the bleak 70s but during the 80s, when SoHo is on the rise to (or well into) the gentrification of today. On my first, and all subsequent visits to SoHo, I have felt and then relived disillusion while seeing major brand stores in the neighborhood. Seeing SoHo today, its hard to believe After Hours as an Oddyssean fairy tale that probably set out to satire the preconceptions of SoHo at the time, of a somewhat dangerous place.One of the reasons I love After Hours is its easy-breezy feel. I read somewhere that Scorsese took on the film on a career low, when other options where few. If that forced him into this territory, lovers of Scorsese should be thankful, since After Hours serves up something very different from his classic show-pieces (however great they may be). I can think of very few films that are quite as enjoyable and easily consumed but still should be considered a serious piece of work. The film leans more towards comedy than is often the case with Scorsese but with familiar camera and editing work. The pace is high throughout the movie and the twists and turns of the story is always entertaining. Other highlight are of course small parts by favorites like John Heard and Catherine O'Hara.After Hours is arguably the most underrated of Scorseses film (despite the high IMDb and Metascore ratings). Overshadowed by many of his other highlights, many will probably consider it a minor Scorsese due to its mainly comedic touch. At the same time, it is a highly entertaining thriller and a proof to Scorseses versatility.",After Hours

However a few minutes into the film and i became envisioned into what was a dark, dirty New York night.The excellent plot, camera work and overall experience leaves you grasped in the film with your face mostly planted in the screen. A long with the good acting performances you truly feel emotional with the characters which is a rare thing in a lot of movies these days. The atmosphere is constantly dark, grimy and unwilling. This is by no means an ""evil"" film, rather so it's very comedic. However Scorsese manages to deliver a feeling that keeps you tense through-out the whole movie wondering what's going to happen next. The subtle hints are perfectly subtle enough to somewhat expect what could happen only to leave yourself surprised of what actually does happen.A crude long-drawn ironic joke plagues the main character ending in a most favorable fashion with plenty of laughs over the malicious delight that the main character experiences.I quite enjoyed this film, in face i even enjoyed it so much i might watch it a second time.9/10 A very well portrayed tale",After Hours

The fact that the script jokes about thing that are not laughable (rape, suicide...) does not help at all.I understand that this movie's absurd humour and the way it deals with twisted versions of actual 80s fears probably were very innovative in its time, but nowadays its not enough to surprise the average viewer.",After Hours

You know there's gotta be something special to it and hope to make you mind work in such a way so you will find what everything makes sense at least to you...The movie did finally make sense to me.

Leaving aside this little parenthesis regarding my personal tastes, this film must be seen EVERYTHING without distractions because it starts with a fairly quiet and usual situation, in which Paul, the protagonist of the grotesque story, meets a girl in a bar and wants to meet her. A series of events all densely and hilariously intertwined makes a night pass completely to forget for our poor protagonist who is a simple computer programmer who tries to move his social life for one evening.It was a really hilarious vision also for the ending that doesn't make poor Paul go home, where he just wanted to rest for the bad night, but to work, returning to that boring tranquility that in the end was not so bad after this grotesque agony.Obviously, as far as directing is concerned, I really have nothing to say and dear old Martin Scorsese has RE-confirmed himself once again with a film that at first glance would never have attracted me, surprising me and making me tear not a few smiles, a few laughs.ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED and very smooth to view, with a very affordable duration below the average of Uncle Martin's films.",After Hours

196,Jimreid21,This is how you do it Todd Phillips.,8,9 September 2015,"In terms of films that play on the shtick of all night adventures this feels more like Martin Scorsese then Harold and Kumar. The movie features a man who goes to meet a girl up for a late night date and possible action. The girl Marcy, played wonderfully by Rosanna Arquette,is a weird, spacey, and mysterious girl. Her troubled past and her possession of burn ointment send our protagonist Paul running. Over the course of the night he finds himself running about Soho dealing with everything from an angry mob to two burglarizing Latinos played by Cheech and Chung. The biggest problem I had with this movie was that it felt a little too rushed. I feel like this could have been 20 minutes longer and focused on some of the funny dialogue and crazy set pieces like the hectic, crazy, and loud Club Berlin. By this time Martin Scorsese had already directed the movies, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, and now he was trying his hand at comedy again. I have yet to see his comedy drama Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore so I didn't have much insight unto how he might deal with the comedic elements. I must say it was a masterfully done. I compared it frame to frame with The Hangover and although one must concede the much stated phrase ""apples and oranges"", I felt that it was clear who was the master film maker and who was going to lose his touch. Some of the other things I loved about the movie was the appearance of Will Patton as a goth and John Heard as a bar keep. Something about Scorsese I have also noticed in his films is he is able to balance the comedy and drama well and not seek out side bursting humor. He focuses on subtle humor that gets lost among the drama but doesn't kill the comedy altogether. And he manages to have scenes of high drama without losing the comedic edge. I would have to give this movie an 8/10.",After Hours
197,benpeltz,Great Movie,9,28 July 2013,"This movie movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from very beginning. Paul Hackett is an average guy who finds himself in a world where he is the only one who is not insane. Everyone he meets presents him with a new challenge. The entire movie gives you this weird panic feeling that does't go away until the very end. As usual Scorsese did a brilliant job directing, and the music just added to the creepy feeling. The camera work was very cool, especially for the time the movie was made in and budget it was given. The acting was also great, all the characters were very believable. The only downside was that there were a couple continuity issues. But overall this movie was a big success.",After Hours
198,mtdb25,"Clever, Original, Surreal Black comedy (POSS. **SPOILERS)",10,12 October 2004,"After Hours is a classic, highly original and bizarre movie that reveals its greatness only through repeated viewings. It all takes place over one night, and becomes a surreal, unpredictable journey through the Manhattan underworld. If you like cleverly written, unpredictable stories then this film is for you. There are great cameo performances from the likes of Rosanna Arquette, Linda Fiorentino and Teri Garr among others. The film begins like a gentle romantic comedy, but as soon as Paul gets into the taxi to go to Marcy's Manhattan loft apartment, everything begins to go wrong and the film turns more sinister.Scorsese is a master at creating a sense of unease, with scenes cleverly set up to make you fear the worst, and share Paul's growing paranoia. This happens particularly with Marcy's character, with the suggestion that things aren't quite right, and why was she visiting the all-night drug store? ""It's under control"" says a guarded Kiki. The plot twists are often difficult to predict but the clues are there, and by a bizarre sequence of events, (SPOILER) Paul is unable to return home and ends up being persecuted by a vigilante mob with a Mr Softy truck.These scenes with actor Griffin Dunne running through the streets in the middle of the night are the highlights of the film - he witnesses a shooting while hiding up a fire escape, and says almost to camera: ""I'll probably get blamed for that."" It's vintage comedy of the darkest kind, and a journey into one man's soul on a search for love and acceptance. The sad thing is that most of the characters he meets are also just looking for a soul mate too, but the yuppy world that Paul comes from makes him too prejudiced and unable to see through their apparent weirdness to the lonely person underneath.",After Hours
199,vaughgeran,Great Dark Comedy,10,31 January 2006,"This piece should be in the dictionary as definition for ""dark comedy"". Never have I seen a better example. It is a series of unfathomable circum-happenstances that send the lead character (and the viewing audience) careening from place to place, person to person, event to event, beginning to end.""After Hours"" also gives the viewer some of the strangest banter from an even more odd assemblage of individuals which are thrust at our hero throughout his ""very interesting evening"". Yet, as odd as they may seem, only this group could come together to make his escapade somewhat plausible.Great cinema.",After Hours
200,klvnmatthews,One of Scorsese's most underrated films,9,16 November 2004,"This wasn't a big hit when it came out, but it should have been. Martin Scorsese is a master of creating atmosphere and exploring a specific setting, and he has proved that in movies like Taxi Driver and Gangs of New York. In this film he brings the SoHo of the early to mid 1980s to life in brilliant and surreal fashion. Griffin Dunne is a great Every Man character. You like him from the very first scene and you follow his adventures with excitement and dread. The tension in this film is also intense, and that is amazing for a light hearted comedy. I am always surprised to hear that people have not seen this movie, or that people don't like this movie. I urge all Scorsese fans to see it. It's one of his best, even though many critics did not like it when it came out. It's a cult hit, but it deserves to be more than that too. It's a masterpiece.",After Hours
201,jeandesanto,Worst Night Ever,10,6 July 2019,"This movie starts quiet and turns into a rollicking things gone wrong epic. When it was first out, there were not a lot movies like it. Underground New York. Spaces usually not seen in mainstream films. It was just a fun good time.",After Hours
202,LT_RYVEN,Amazingly Addictive/Secuctive/Surrealistic Fantasy,10,26 February 2005,"Well this movie is a Ground-Breaking piece of work in my opinion. Its described as surreal and thats what it is, its almost like a ""Trip"" (off drugs) put in a t.v.Its AMAZING, even from a pot heads point of view. Its a pure escape from the moment go, watching and the movie its self is an unexpected escape.Its a complex story with unprecedented twists and turns. There are times when all his chips are down and things just seem to be at the worst point for him, but something always happens and he's alright. Caution should be taken as this film will probably have a profound effect on your ""new"" life, It did me. Its so immersing your gonna have trouble getting out, maybe thats not a bad thing. It ALL seems believable but you just know that it cudn't happen in real life, COULD IT? 15 out of 10.",After Hours
203,j-mather,an inspiring film without question.,10,12 January 2005,"something gripped me about this movie. I felt as if I was somehow drawn into it in some way or other.The loft, the terminal bar and tom,s flat on Spring street, all seemed to capture my innermost feelings as if I somehow needed to belong there.I feel strongly that I MUST visit those places, especially,the Terminal bar and Marci's loft.I have watched this movie on video over and over again, several times a week magnetically. Am I going crazy or something ? I cannot name the magic phenomena which appears to surround it.I first saw it on British TV about four years ago when it first made its impression upon me since which time I have been drawn to it like a magnet for some unexplainable reason.",After Hours
204,lse-2,And the point is?,8,12 March 2021,"Don't go on a date with just 20 bucks in your pocket.
Anyways a great movie with sometimes unrealistic or illogical behavior by the main protagonist.
And I'm really glad that the movie didn't end one minute earlier, thou it would have made a great ending.",After Hours
205,llcooljohn,bleeeeeenhhhhhhhhhhhhnnnyyyyyaaaaaaaa hoop ja! hoop ja!! nnnyaaaaaaa,9,4 January 2010,"Strangely uncelebrated Scorsese movie. 1985 release. Average Joe sent through the wars on bizarro night time odyssey in Manhattan. Eyes Wide Shut springs to mind, with some justification. Shares a broad premise and some detail with that film, but is less stately in tone and has a sense of humour, albeit dark. Scorsese is here revelling in technique, the sheer volume of shots alone is dizzying (eleven in one three or four second sequence for instance). The variety of framing is equally hyperactive: extreme close-ups, the camera side-ways, upside-down, rapid push ins and pull outs for no particular reason at all. Thankfully all this is married to an equally frenetic script, which spotlights the horror element of farce and, in doing so, dispenses with the more tedious aspects.",After Hours

207,dearprudence-2,a unique film in all its aspects,10,20 January 2006,"One of my favorite movies ever. First of all, the film takes place in maybe 9 hours, which is like a wink to all standards of classical theater. Enjoy this ambition ! Classic laws of theater in a very ""off "" environment, excellent start! The hero , Griffin Dunn, is the normal guy transfigured by a city , like Charlotte in room with a view, only NY as a filigree character swallows him and turns him in a another of his cell body, a crazy citizen like all the other characters he meets that night. In no other film you will see such brilliant editing and such absolute genius in directing actors. This film is, to me , THE film of Scorcese. The ambassador of NY as the most accurate and visionary director of this city. The frantic cuts resonates with the frantic night, the echo of the music is a tribute to the American culture turned into a crazy soundtrack as to express the twisted side of it (the ice cream machine, all standards in the most surreal situation : what a bless! great Howard Shore score too) You can read this film at many levels, some will see cruelty, some fun, some surrealism, but all these forms of narrations are mixed together in the most natural and consistent way. The wandering and transformation of its hero has a message to deliver, but can be also taken very lightly, which is in itself a splendid way to depict NY. You can see whatever, but crazy things are happening, whatever you do, and they do affect you , like a contagious ""disease"". Griffin Dunn should have won an Oscar for that role. A must see!",After Hours
