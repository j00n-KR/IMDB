0,MartinHafer,"It's horrible but at least it's not ""Disaster Movie""!",1,19 February 2010,"""Disaster Movie"" was a horribly unfunny and pathetic film. Likewise, ""Epic Movie"" is also horribly unfunny and pathetic...but at least it was slightly better! Unlike ""Disaster Movie"", this one actually had two or three laughs--very small laughs, but laughs nonetheless.Like ""Meet the Spartans"", ""Disaster Movie"" and 174 other recent movies, this one is a rapid-fire parody of many recent movies. And, like all these other films, it's mostly crappy--with very few laughs. The jokes are rapid-fire but unlike the original film of this type, ""Airplane"", the jokes never worked. They would have been better off in hindsight to just stop making these sort of terrible films a lot time ago but they have continued for one reason alone--many teenagers are so stupid and sheep-like that they'll go see anything!!! Nothing else could explain the proliferation of these crap-tastic films.Some of the parodied films include ""The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe"", ""Harry Potter"", ""X-Men"", ""Snakes on a Plane"" and ""The DaVinci Code"" and it could have been funny. The problem, however, is that the writing was absolutely pathetic and it truly appears as if no one cared. After all, not giving a darn is the only way that would explain how a Harry Potter parody has not a single laugh! Overall, a bore-fest with lousy writing, acting and direction that appears as if the director was just punching a time clock--hoping the unfunny mess would just finish itself quickly so they could go on to the next slap-dash production.",Epic Movie
1,TheLittleSongbird,I can't vote lower than 1?,1,16 October 2009,"I will admit I didn't see this until a couple of days ago, and I was really hesitant of seeing it, after reading a lot of negative reviews on the film, and after seeing the excrement that is Disaster Movie. And let me tell you, after seeing this travesty for myself, I can't agree more with the negativity. While not quite as monstrous as Disaster Movie, Epic Movie(more like Epic Dud) is a truly terrible movie. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities here. The humour just isn't funny. It is crude, vulgar, over-familiar and even contrived, and the constant flashing of breasts was way overdone. The acting was really amateur, Jennifer Coolidge and Carmen Electra get my vote as the worst actresses in the movie, and believe me that is not saying much. The Willy Wonka spoof was just as tired as the movie itself. And as a parody of films like Pirates of the Caribbean and chronicles of Narnia, it falls well short in terms of sophistication. The writing is unbelievably bad, the characters are annoying and the plot just isn't there. The music was awful, and the pirate rap was torturously bad. I will say right now, that I don't like any of the recent Friedberg-Seltzer movies, merely because not only do I feel that there is a complete lack of comedic talent in their films, but also their films come across as a complete waste of time. And just like Disaster Movie, I seriously was considering turning the film off 20 minutes in, that's how painful I found it. All in all, probably not quite the worst movie ever, but along with movies like Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Freddy Got Fingered, it is close. A complete disaster of epic proportions, and one to avoid, even if you're thinking of renting. I'm not trying to sound harsh, I am just trying to explain as much as I can what I feel about the movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Epic Movie
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Surely a candidate for minus scores.,1,6 February 2018,"Sometimes you wonder why a production team doesn't cut a movie when they're making it, having the obvious realisation that what they're making is dreadful, surely it's more financially damaging to complete and release a diabolical mess like this, then it would have been to say stop. The premise seems good, two of the writers from Scary movie take the spoof them to a bigger scale, but do it so badly. It's unfunny, it could be deemed offensive, there is virtually nothing positive I can say about it, the acting is unforgivable in this day and age, it smacks of 1980's b movie all the way through, I realise they were up against it with the script, but come on. Do something more useful, like clean the bathroom, 1/10.",Epic Movie
3,jboothmillard,Epic Movie,1,9 September 2009,"It is rare that I recognise every single film spoofed in something like this, and while that it good, it doesn't help that it is as bad as Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie. Basically four troubled orphans: Edward (Kal Penn), Peter (Adam Campbell), Lucy (Jayma Mays) and Susan (Faune A. Chambers), from four scenarios, are brought together after getting a golden ticket to a wacky chocolate factory, only to be trapped by its owner Willy (Back to the Future's Crispin Glover). Hiding from the scary chocolate maker, Lucy gets into a wardrobe leading to the magical world of ""Gnarnia"", greeted by Mr. Tumnus (Héctor Jiménez), who tells her everything she needs to know. Soon Edward enters the world too, and meets its ruler, the nasty but sexy White Bitch (Jennifer Coolidge), who obviously needs to be defeated for everyone's freedom. Soon all orphans are in Gnarnia and all find out eventually that they are related, and that they are prophesied to take over Gnarnia. After seeking a little help from randy lion-man Also (Fred Willard), some training at the castle of Harry Potter (Kevin McDonald), and joining the armies of X-Men heroes and swash-buckling pirates, without drunk Captain Jack Swallows (Darrell Hammond), the battle for freedom begins. Featuring attempted spoofs of The Da Vinci Code, Snakes on a Plane, Nacho Libre (Jareb Dauplaise), X-Men: The Last Stand, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Mission: Impossible III, Superman Returns, Punk'd, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Casino Royale, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Click. Also starring Tony Cox as Bink, Razzie nominated Carmen Electra as Mystique, Kill Bill's David Carradine as Museum Curator, George Alvarez as Ron, Crista Flanagan as Hermoine, Dane Farwell as Dumbledore, Jim Piddock as Magneto, Rat Race's Vince Vieluf as Wolverine, as Nacho Libre, Danny Jacobs as Borat, David Lehre as Ashton Kutcher Look-Alike, James Walker Sr. as Samuel Jackson Look-Alike, Cordele Taylor as Kanye West Look-Alike, Alla Petrou as Paris Hilton Look-Alike, Gregory Jbara as Mel Gibson Look-Alike, Katt M. Williams as Harry Beaver and Darko Belgrade as James Bond, with narration by Roscoe Lee Browne. With the same repetitive jokes, i.e. toilet gags, disgusting bodily stuff, hitting people in the face and crotch, sexy naked chicks, killing a not-very-liked celebrity, etc, there is nothing epic about this film, and how it went to number one in America is a complete miracle, a waste of time. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Remake or Rip-Off and Worst Screenplay. Poor!",Epic Movie
4,tavm,Epic Movie has WAY lower standards than classics like Airplane! and Blazing Saddles,2,27 January 2007,"When I was a kid I watched movies like Blazing Saddles and Airplane! Both were (and still are) hilariously funny to me and while I knew they both were spoofing certain genres and even certain movies I never thought it was essential to see the original sources in order to get the jokes. Also, while the gags were the thing, I also think a little more attention was paid to both characterization and plot. As a result, little dated either one. Watch something like Epic Movie, however, and you can't help but think they've thrown everything (from various TV shows and movies) but the kitchen sink (and no sink is literally thrown as far as I can tell). This results in such a hodge podge of parodies upon parodies that the plot gets interrupted constantly and characterization (what there is of it) is violated for cheap laughs (of which there were few on my side). I did like the performances of Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge. Otherwise, this was mostly a waste of time for me.",Epic Movie

6,lastliberal,Who wants to play with Willy?,2,30 December 2007,"I really tuned into this just to see Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle). Boy! This was just about one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen.Jennifer Coolidge from ""Joey"" was just about the only thing worth seeing here, although Penn wasn't too bad. And, Darrell Hammond did make a fairly good Captain Jack.It was almost like ""Anybody not doing anything this weekend I've got a gig for you."" If you want to see how a spoof should be done, then watch Mel Brook's History of the World, Part I.",Epic Movie
7,zardoz-13,Nothing Epic Here,2,20 May 2007,"""Epic Movie"" (*1/2 out of ****), a lewd, lame-brained, lackluster lampoon of Hollywood movie epics with look-alike actors impersonating celebrity stars, lacks anything approaching either epic proportions or hilarity. The two guysJason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer--that wrote and directed last year's ""Date Movie,"" an amusing enough parody of romantic 'chick flick' comedies, don't fare as well in their attempt to send up big budget adventure sagas. Comparatively, ""Epic Movie"" isn't a fourth as funny as ""Date Movie."" Okay, you'll smile a lot when you watch ""Epic Movie,"" recognize the movies that Friedberg and Seltzer are ridiculing, but you won't laugh out loud or laugh so long or hard that you miss the next three sight gags or verbal puns. Unfortunately, most of the humor is half-baked adolescent antics. Moreover, when the jokes fall flatas they often do, Friedberg and Seltzer fall back in desperation on lowest common denominator clowning, such as having their characters spell their names in the snow with their own urine. Other instances include spitting, drooling, breaking wind, projectile vomiting, and slurping up raw sewage. Friedberg and Seltzer skewer a number of Tinsel town blockbusters, principally ""Nacho Libre,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""Scarface,"" ""Click,"" ""Snakes on a Plane,"" the ""X-Men"" trilogy, the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" flicks, ""Superman Returns,"" and ""The Da Vinci Code."" ""Epic Movie"" follows the exploits of four twenty-something orphans drawn together in a common goal to save themselves from a wicked plot concocted by a madcap Willy Wonka (Crispin Glover) who wants to cannibalize their body parts for his tasty new chocolate bars. More by misadventure than design, our quartet of protagonistsLucy (Jayma Mays of ""Red Eye""), Edward (Kal Penn of ""Van Wilder 2""), Susan (Faune A. Chambers of ""White Chicks"") and Peter (Adam Campbell of the TV's ""Commando Nanny"") obtain tickets to tour Willy's magical kingdom of chocolate. When our heroes and heroines realize the pot into which their body parts are about to be stirred, they try to escape Willy's premises by ducking into an apparently ordinary wardrobe (a free-standing, old fashion closet) and wind up in the land of Gnariathe G is silent for legal purposeswhere they stumble upon land of enchanted animals. Some of these creatures are part beast and part human, and they are locked in a battle for survival against a dastardly dame (Jennifer Coolidge of ""American Pie"") appropriately named the White Bitch. Kal recognizes her immediately in one of the film's few clever moments: ""It's Stifler's mother!"" She captures Kal, and he divulges the whereabouts of his cohorts after a pirate captain (Darrell Hammond of TV's ""Saturday Night Live"") tricks him into a confession. Happily, our protagonists elude the notorious White Bitch and link up with the half-human/half-beast rebels led by Also (Fred Willard of ""Date Movie"") who is the half-man/half-lion that leads the insurgents.""Epic Movie"" does an adequate enough job of imitating its source material, but a good parody must do more than imitate. The best parodies mock the clichés and conventions of its source material by revealing the absurdity that lies beneath those formulaic elements. Most of the time, however, ""Epic Movie"" only imitates. Furthermore, ""Epic Movie"" rarely exposes the absurdity of the movies that it derides and more often than not what should be absurd ends up being asinine. The opening scene that pokes fun at ""The Da Vinci Code"" is as witless as the nitwit character that it introduces. A later scene where a Samuel L. Jackson look-alike actor spouts blasphemous language constantly, like a compact disc stuck in repeat mode, is just as cretinous. The goal of a good parody is to stand something serious on its head to show how goofy it can be from another perspective. Neither ""The Da Vinci Code"" nor the ""Snakes on a Plane"" scenes reveal the lunacy behind the plots. ""Epic Movie,"" however, wastes a first-rate cast. Christian Glover of ""River's Edge"" is ideally cast as the sinister Willy in the Johnny Depp role from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" Similarly, Darrell Hammond's impersonation of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is dead letter perfect. In ""Epic Movie,"" he is called Jack Swallows rather than Jack Sparrows. Ha, ha, right? Jayma Mays does a better job of spoofing Anna Faris from the ""Scary Movie"" franchise than Anna Faris does playing herself. Meanwhile, Jennifer Coolidge is appropriately villainous as the White Bitch and Fred Willard excels as the brave lion Also, both of whom hail from the ""Narnia"" film.One of the best scenes shows Harry Potter as a 50-year old and his girlfriend Hermione Granger as a pregnant, chain-smoker who lets her full to bursting belly bulge from beneath her blouse. This scene works nominally better than most because the actors in the ""Harry Potter"" movies have grown older than the actual age of their characters. Another good joke involves the talking beaver from the sleep aid TV commercial who helps our heroes and heroine in this efforts to defeat the sorceress.",Epic Movie
8,Boba_Fett1138,Makes you want to watch a Leslie Nielsen spoof instead.,2,1 February 2008,"OK I admit, this movie was bad. I'm not the kind of person who easily jumps on the wagon when basically everybody says a particular movie is beyond bad. I mean, I actually liked ""Soul Plane"" for what it was and I think its OK to laugh at a silly Leslie Nielsen every now or then. But ""Epic Movie"" is just plain and simple a bad movie, with no redeeming qualities.So, what is the problem with ""Epic Movie""? Well, what isn't? First of all it just seemed to me that the writers at advance made a list of all 2006 movies they wanted to spoof. Then they thought to themselves how to connect all those different spoof sequences and make one whole move out of it. The end result is unfortunately what the poor viewers got presented. There is not obvious connection between everything which makes this a terrible disjointed spoof to watch, with something that is supposedly supposed to be a story but feels more like a labyrinth, that goes from left to right and flips over, with behind each corner a total different movie it spoofs, as you go through this mess they call a movie.On top of that, this movie just really isn't funny. Seriously this is the best they could come up with? I mean, it's not like 2006 didn't had any good spoof-able movies. There were so many opportunities for them but instead they came up with incredible lame and unfunny sequences, characters and dialog. It makes you wonder, didn't the actors realized that what they did just wasn't funny? Why didn't they just quite and walked off the set, that would had saved them a lot of embarrassment.The movie still has some good production values and is good and professional looking, which is basically the only reason why I just can't rate it any lower.2/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Epic Movie
9,neil-476,There are better spoofs,4,13 December 2009,"This movie isn't dreadful, but it isn't that great. It's always a bad sign, in my view, when the funniest scenes involve mistreating midgets.Jayma Mays may have a career playing Anna Faris once Anna Faris is fed up with playing Anna Faris.Some of the jokes are OK, most are not that good. It was a mistake to concentrate so heavily on The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe, particularly as Adam Chambers is so unequal to the task of playing the Peter character. The portrayal of the Tumnus character was just awful.I'm not as negative about this film as many seem to be, but it's really difficult to work up much sincere enthusiasm.",Epic Movie
10,anaconda-40658,Epic Waste of Time.,3,1 May 2015,"Epic Movie (2007): Dir: Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer / Cast: Kal Penn, Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, Crispin Glover, Tony Cox: Satire making fun of massive productions in big films. Four orphans travel to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory only to escape through a closet into the land of Gnarnia ruled by the evil White Bitch. Starts with promise before showcasing cheap production values and overplayed jokes about urination, vomiting and bestiality. Directed half heartedly by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who prove that two people can make just as bad a film as a solo individual. Kal Penn seems stranded among the victims as he searches for answers. Jennifer Coolidge is typecast as the White Bitch whose ambition is to rule Gnarnia. Fred Willard plays a sex addicted man lion whose transformation from human to lion ranks among the worst display of special effects. Crispin Glover appears as Willy Wonka in full Michael Jackson mode. Glover is funny for the brief time he is present but perhaps more footage would have hit home. Tony Cox is also featured as the dwarf henchman for Coolidge but he presence is becoming tiring in these film and too much of a self parody. Making fun of epic movies, particularly The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it becomes one big embarrassing epic for one's patience.

11,movieman_kev,An awful festering boil on celluloid that will make you lose your faith in humanity,1,28 May 2007,"Epic Movie makes the otherwise dreadful Date Movie look like it has all the wit of a Marx brothers film. I choose to watch this, I will NOT dignify it by calling it a film as I don't want to sully the word, this thing out of morbid curiosity at just how bad a bottom 100 rated thing on IMDb could possibly be. I was not ready for this inept 'spoof' film that is cringe-worthily unfunny The lame pansy ass shots at movies actually spells out what the spoof they're doing is from!!! So it's not only vastly unfunny, it also treats the audience like some severely mentally retarded sloths (which, I'll concede, is in likelihood the coveted demographic they're going after). EVERYone involved in this soul-sucking piece of rancid dog feces should not only be deeply deeply ashamed of themselves, but should actually be sentenced to do community service of some kind. I think it's current standing of 43rd worst thing of all time is actually way to optimistic, as it's not one of, but THE worst supposed comedy I've EVER seen in my life. Trust me I've seen a lot and suffered through many a bad film. But in all sincerity this thing is as painful an experience as having a gravel enema, while your eyes are held open by rusty priors forced to see grandma provide fellatio to a sickly dog who gets so exited his bowels go and he defecates in a baby sister's mouth which she gulps down with delight. No wait, this is worse MUCH MUCH worse. Now i'm not a movie snob in the least. my tastes range from Shawshank redemption to Polyester. From Die Hard to The Toxic Avenger. I love spoof films like Airplane, Naked Gun, Kentucky Fried Movie and Scary Movie (the first one).But I sincerely do NOT want to meet anyone who even chuckled once at this abomination. It's utterly and supremely horrid in every single conceivable way, from the wanna-be Anna Farris, Jayma Mays to the proof that Kal Penn in Harold and Kumar was his highest achievement in life to the brain numbingly so called 'spoofs'. David Carridine, do you need the money THIS badly? Carmen Elektra, what in the hell were they holding over your head?? must have been supremely embarrassing indeed as you were married to Rodman. Fred Willard, where the hell did your career go??? Poor poor Kevin ""Kids in the Hall"" McDonald how could you slum this badly?? Lastly (and i DO mean lastly) to Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer: How can you hate all of humanity with such a passion as to inflict these travesties on us. Every single film you've done thus far, and likely in the future, is complete and utter sh*#. You've totally bypassed other horrible incompetent film makers as Uwe Boll, and others that names escape me at the moment. You're both the worst.My Grade: F",Epic Movie
12,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Epic Movie,1,16 February 2007,"My opinion whether a comedy is a good comedy is fairly simple - even laughs throughout, and in having at least one sequence to make me chuckle so hard that my tears will roll down uncontrollably. I don't care if it's physical slapstick, witty dialogue or crass toilet humour. So long as my tears roll, it's a winner. But sadly, Epic Movie failed to meet the mark.It's plain boring. Drawing its material from some of the largest ""summer"" blockbusters, like The Da Vinci Code, X-Men, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Borat, Pirates of the Caribbean, Nacho Libre, Click, Snakes on a Plane, Fast and the Furious, Harry Potter and Superman Returns, Epic Movie follows the formula of taking a mickey out of genre movies. Written and directed by two of the many writers who gave us Scary Movie (a dig on horrors, thrillers and slasher flicks, the strongest of the franchise and still going), and Date Movie (one off bomb, taking a dig on romantic movies), Epic Movie is uninspiring, and the jokes are very lame.In fact, I found myself yawning at the juvenile antics on screen, playing up plenty of times at the expense of sexuality - big boobs, kinky names, and countless gyrating female bodies. Even Stifler's Mom Jennifer Coolidge makes an appearance as the White Bitch, as do many other celebrities having themselves spoofed at by lookalikes - P Diddy, Ashton Kutcher, Mel Gibson, Paris Hilton, Michael Jackson, Samuel L Jackson, James Blonde, I mean Bond, even, and various Star Wars characters . Even theme songs from the movies get parodied, the most obvious being Teriyaki Boyz's Tokyo Drift theme.The only kudos you can give to the filmmakers, are how they try to gel all these skits into one coherent movie - having all the different movies put together into a common thread is indeed a challenge, and you can't deny the effort. The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe forms the backbone of the story, while the rest are scenes which tangent off, or brought together into the world of Gnarnia. The sets too from the movies it adapted from also get recreated, probably on the cheap, and they do look as good as the original (if not gotten from them).To really make your money's worth, stay throughout the end credits which run pretty long, where you'll see three sequences at various points, and you can bolt out of the door once you see the jab on Mel Gibson. For those who want to give this a miss on the big screen, a word of advice, don't even rent it on VCD unless it's free.",Epic Movie
13,siderite,"Boring, unfunny, completely useless",3,28 July 2007,"Who makes movies like this? It's like Scary Movie 5, only less funny, more gross, idiotic, moronic than either of the exceptionally stupid 4 Scary Movies.There isn't much to say here except avoid at all costs. It's not even Austin Powers funny, it's not funny at all, it's boring. I can watch just about everything and tonight I was in the mood for anything, no matter how dumb. But this was way beyond dumb, after 30 minutes I deleted it.Whoever rented this movie or payed money for theater tickets should demand a refund. It's not even a movie. I have an idea of how to make funnier and more interesting films: just flip the channels randomly with the remote and mix the scenes together. Bleah, what a piece of dung.",Epic Movie
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, yeah, it's retarded, but it's not AS bad as Date Movie",2,24 May 2007,"Now, I don't know why, but I was sooooo curious on what a travesty of film making this movie supposedly is, just if it really was THAT bad. Date Movie is possibly the worst movie that was ever made, so I was expecting a stupid movie, now it is, BUT, I have to admit that I laughed more than I did in Date Movie, but that's not much considering that Date Movie did not get one laugh from me. Epic Movie got like 4 laughs, while they were incredibly stupid and predictable jokes, I admit there were a couple parts I couldn't help but laugh too, like the Click parody and the Jack ""Swallows"" character. There were so many mistakes in this film, I think some were done intentionally though and people were kinda going crazy on them.Four orphans go to a chocolate factory where they discover a closet, where the inside leads to the world of Gnarnia. But it's being ruled by, well, a white B-word, the land needs saving. The four orphans discover not only that they are related, but that they are destined to take over the land and save the goat like people, with some other parody characters.Epic Movie is annoying, stupid, and immature, but I think people did jump a little too fast to just give it the most nasty review possible. I mean, come on, I think there are WORSE films, we know it. This is a movie you might just wanna open your mind too and see where it goes, like I said, it's a stupid movie that I would not be surprised if it got a couple razzie awards, but I think you might get a couple of silly laughs.2/10",Epic Movie
15,OllieSuave-007,An Epic Travesty!,1,17 June 2007,"I guess this movie was trying too hard to follow the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. If it is, it failed miserably. Four orphans are invited to Willie Wonka and the Chocolate (and sewage) factory, where they eventually get stumbled onto a plot by the ""White Bitch"" to rule the world. They must defeat her to save the world and free Gnarnia.In this movie, we see one parody after the other, but done so in an unfunny, tasteless, overly-crude and overbearing way. What follows is a boring story with silly characters and dumb antics. What renders this movie to borderline annoying is the use of excessive rap songs in a number of scenes. Put in some political puns (Fake Saddam Hussein or the real WMDs?), this movie was sure an epic travesty. I got to mention that my one favorite scene in the movie is the ""Paris Hilton"" sequence, where she is squashed by a falling Susan.Other than that, don't bother with this film.

16,Buddy-51,a complete waste of celluloid,2,4 March 2007,"As movie parodies go, ""Epic Movie"" is an aggressively unfunny hodgepodge of such recent movie blockbusters as ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""The Da Vinci Code,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""X-Men"" and even ""Snakes on a Plane"" (despite its decidedly ""un-epic"" nature), most of them not really worth mimicking in the first place.

17,cherold,not as good as Scary Movie and not *quite* as terrible as Date Movie,3,16 August 2008,"In spite of many horrible comments, I thought I should check out Epic Movie because when it comes right down to it, all these sorts of low-brow, multi-film spoofs get terrible comments. So I want to try and put this movie in the context of its siblings.Epic Movie is not as bad as Date Movie. Date Movie was painful, it was agony to watch and I gave up on it pretty quickly; maybe 20, 25 minutes. Epic Movie is more along the lines of dull with occasional amusing bits (notably a silly running gag of one character repeating another's lines). This is not to say it doesn't have painful moments (particularly anything based on MTV/Hip Hop/street culture. I watched about 35 minutes and then began to fast forward looking for amusing bits without much luck. So I probably wound up actually seeing about half the movie.Scary Movies 1 through 3 were all much, much better than Epic Movie. I don't have a strong recollection of Scary Movie 4. I don't think it was as good as the first 3, but would say it was still several steps up from Epic Movie.There's no real reason to see this movie, but at least it's not Date Movie.

19,Robert_duder,For the spoof film genre Epic Movie is not too bad,5,5 February 2007,"Alright so I HATE Spoof films...HATE THEM!! I think Scary Movie (all of them) were travesties to film making along with so called classics like Hot Shots, Naked Gun, Airplane, and follow that with Not Another Teen Movie, Date Movie, and now the EPIC MOVIE!! People complain endlessly about ""how stupid"" these movies are but they always make lots of cash and spawn plenty of sequels. So in order to appease my review readers I bit the bullet and went to see Epic Movie. As spoof films go Epic Movie turned out to be the least of this crappy genre!! It certainly wasn't great or overtly entertaining but from the perspective of spoof films it wasn't bad. It's one of those spoof films that mercifully doesn't shove the spoofs down your throat or go out of it's way to find a way to spoof whatever they want to. I mean to a certain extent they have to do that and there is no way around it...and as with all spoof films lately it's brutally short because you can only mock other movies for so long. As far as story lines go as hard as it is to have one...this one does manage to have somewhat of a watchable story.Kal Penn, Adam Campbell, Jayma Mays and Faune A. Chambers all do a decent job playing off of each other and they suit their respective roles. Kal Penn tends to be the strongest but then he is the actor and comedian with the most experience in this cast. Add in some very funny performances by Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, Crispin Glover, Carmen Electra and a brilliant turn by very funny and clever comedian Darrell Hammond as Captain Jack Swallows.As expected most of the humorous scenes are in the trailer and you can pretty much see the jokes coming from a mile but it's still entertaining enough to not make you groan a lot of the impressions in the film are funny and quite often spot on (ie: Darrell Hammond.) One of the most impressive things about this spoof film that automatically gains points for me is that the dirty, bodily function jokes are barely existent!! It isn't constant fart, barf, urinate jokes although there are some...remarkably it isn't the major focus. When all is said and done there are a million things better to see than Epic Movie but to each their own and some people like spoof films and if you don't you might not hate this one too badly. 5/10",Epic Movie
20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Largely unfunny parody of recent Hollywood blockbusters,2,17 February 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Four daft American teenagers each gain by chance a ticket to Willy Wonka's magical chocolate factory, only to realize it's a trap where he wants to use all their organs to make chocolate (or something?)

I've always had a soft spot for these send ups of big budget films that take themselves too seriously, even when everyone else generally gives them bad reviews, but the negative comments on Epic Movie have been pretty consistent (telling by it's current position in the IMDb bottom 100) and it's fair to say this is pretty much one of the worst of the genre I've seen in some time. It had the potential to be one of the best, a promising and ambitious send up of very recent blockbusters (so none of the jokes would be lost on anybody) but that it should be so virtually laugh free through-out should be some indication of what a failure it is. Another thing that brought it down were the spoof scenes with a hip hop theme to them, with the booming, heavy based music playing over everything whilst women in skimpy bras and bikinis dance around. These weren't even funny in the two most recent Scary Movie films, but there's a real obnoxious element to them here. As I mentioned in the PS, one of the main character's is called White Bitch, a nasty piece of racial stereotyping if ever I heard one that won't have as many of the minority groups up in arms as much if it had been the other way round. This, along with the standard exploitation of women, really brings out the worst in the black culture the film seems to revolve around.That the film only manages to raise one of two very mild titters, when it should have had me roaring the roof down, shows all the lost opportunity. *",Epic Movie

I figured it would be half descent since it has the funny Kal Penn; however, he can't save this dreadful script. At least with Scary Movie, it's spoofing horror/suspense films and Date Movie spoofs the teen films. But Epic Movie seems to pick movies and TV shows at random to spoof. You expect spoofs of films like LOTR and the Narnia films; those are epics. But this movie goes after the MTV shows Cribs and Punked and spoofs movies from Willy Wonka to Harry Potter.

They enter the land of Gnarnia escaping from Willy Wonka. As I said above, this movie is pretty funny. There were also parts that were just plain silly or boring. The acting wasn't too bad, but it could've been better. I think that the older orphans had the best acting. There is no script as you expect with spoof movies. But, who cares. The jokes make up for the lack of script. Also, there is nice scenery shots if anybody noticed. This movie is not as negative as everyone thinks. I rate this film a 8/10.",Epic Movie

25,ironhorse_iv,This movie is an epic failure. It wasn't really that funny.,1,2 March 2016,"Blockbuster Movies are what make Hollywood into a successful business. These movies are so big they need the italic title 'epic' to describe them. So you would think, parody movies about them, would be, worth the big bucks and worth seeing. However, most of them, the most recent ones are pretty lousy and way low-budget. Probably one of the worst, is the film series, movie 'movie'-cash-in, created by director/writer duo, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg. These movies from them, ranging from 2000's Scary Movie, 2006's Date Movie, to 2008's Disaster Movie, doesn't have the cleverness or smarts to take something serious existing, and make something new with their comedy. These men, are no Mel Brooks, Monty Python, or even Zucker Brothers. I think, the reason, why these two writers are not that funny, is because they create comedic movies that parody and reference recent pop culture without concern for the overarching plot or characterization. There is no bigger example of bigger mishap of that, then 2007's Epic Movie; which goes all over the place, ranging from parodies of music videos, viral memes, commercials & television shows that has nothing to do, with epic movies. It's a reference overdosed. Even, when the movie focus on movie parodies, they pick some of the worst choices to parody about. Honestly, ask yourself this, how do you, make a parody of already establishing comedy. The jokes are not new, nor fresh. Like really, what was the point of having 2006's Nacho Libre & Borat in this type of a film. What does they, have to do with epic movies!? The reason, why I ask this, is because, when most people think of epic movies; most of them, think classic historical fantasy setting, or extreme science fiction settings. In my view, I see those two examples as nowhere near that. One of the main criticisms of their work is that the pop culture jokes that they rely on become outdated within just a few years, with the things that they're parodying having fallen out of the collective consciousness. A few of their gags had fallen out of memory before the respective movie came out. Their tendency to base brief parodies on the trailers to movies that wouldn't be released until well into their own production probably has something to do with it, is jarring. Since this movie has little to no continuity, there is no stalks in caring for the story or the characters. Don't get me wrong, all the main actors and supporting characters were mostly fine, is this film, but when sub-plots, like a group of adult orphans, Edward (Kal Penn) & Peter (Adam Campbell), Susan (Faune A. Chambers) & Lucy (Jayma Mays), being force to be turn into food at the factory, are quickly replace, by a Narnia parody that overtakes the rest of the film. It's become really off-centered. Themes like that, and the out of nowhere, horrible deux ex machina ending made this film, really confusing. After all, there is little to care about their plot conflict. The movie treat death, as if a cartoon. These people get seriously hurt, and are perfectly alright in a few moments later. It doesn't allow enough time for these slapstick jokes to sink in. I get that most of the time, they trying to go the low-brow cartoon-like violence route, but most slapsticks comedies, work best, when you can really sense the pain and misery. The movie has no stalks. Then, there is the somewhat offensive, vulgar humor that movies like this, have. Other films work best with this type of humor, because it allow the scenes to have context. In here, it's mostly use as a throwaway gag like the pointless nudity, this film has. Even the low-brow toilet humor felt kinda forced. Yes, some of the gags in this movie kinda works, but most of it, really fall flat. The ""uncut"" version of this film, apparently decides that the best way to improve its below average comedy, is to add more same running jokes scenes as the original version. In my opinion, it does add anything, worth-while. You could argue that the spoof genre would have died out in the late 2000s regardless, as audience tastes moved to ""bro-comedy"" films, ensemble pieces and more intellectual comedies, not to mention the rise in popularity of quickly-produced, and, therefore, more topical web-based movie parody comedy like College Humor, or Funny or Die, but Seltzer and Friedberg helped completely drive the genre into the ground, with Epic Movie being one that officially signified its own death. These days, most spoof movies are relegated to Direct-To-Video. Due to the nature of their films largely being simplistic parodies of whatever is popular at the time, a number of other parody films in the same style have been wrongly attributed to them. This includes 2001's Not Another Teen Movie, 2008's Superhero Movie and 2009's Dance Flick. While, I wouldn't say, all of the recent parodies are super-awful. I do have to say, overall: Epic Movie is one of those, that is.",Epic Movie

28,Anonymous_Maxine,Total crap just like the rest of them.,1,9 December 2007,"Here's something revealing about Epic Movie. From a purely technical point of view, it has some truly impressive make-up and production values at many points. Some of the set designs and character re-creations from real movies are done in great detail and are actually pretty good. For this reason, the movie wins extra points, and yet it still deserves less than a 1/10. Like the other garbage regularly let loose from this group of talentless buffoons, Epic Movie is yet another barely decipherable shoestring of a plot draped carelessly over a bizarre series of idiotic skits lampooning current popular movies (notice ""popular"" and not ""good""), resulting in another romp through the asinine sense of humor of writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. By the way, these guys remind me of strippers or porn stars. I always wonder what these people say to their parents about their ""careers."" Likewise, how can Friedberg's and Seltzer's parents not be horribly humiliated by what their sons do for a living? How difficult is it for them to keep secret what their kids are currently doing to the world? I mean, can they really possibly watch a movie like this and think, ""That's my boy!"" I should think not. I would wonder about them, too. But hey, these guys are laughing all the way to the bank. They spend all summer at the movies and then go home and rip off as many films as they can and throw in as many disgusting jokes as possible and they are making millions of dollars every time. My only consolation is that I live in China and, since everything is pirated here, those jerks didn't make a dime off of me because I watched it on a pirated DVD. Yeah, that's right. I bought a pirated copy of Epic Movie and I own it. I paid 10 yuan (about $1.35) for it, which is about ten times what it's worth. What a ripoff.Actually I take that back. My other consolation is that they are running out of generic genres. What's next, Children's Movie?",Epic Movie
29,elshikh4,Almost a Course in Making Bad Comedy !,1,20 April 2010,"This is nothing but a very bad comedy. Very bad to a degree that made it a full lesson in making a bad comedy:_The repeating: I don't know how to stand this in comedy. What really exploded the movie, and maybe its viewer, was that the repeating this time came not only for many times, but in many forms too. To instance, repeating the lines sickly like the ones of (Samuel L. Jackson)'s impersonator, or the ones of (Lucy - 2014)'s character (yet endlessly!). And repeating the jokes as well, starting with ""You're standing on my body"" of (David Carradine) coming from other movies, to the matter - it's the matters - of ""human married an animal"", ending with the urinating; which's ugly unfunny one in the first place. This is boring, before being poor and so stupid!_The repugnant impersonators. The problem is that THEY ALL CAN'T DO COMEDY; their only talent is looking and talking like someone. And the bigger problem is that they are just too many: (Samuel L. Jackson) from (Snakes on a Plane - 2006), (Johnny Depp) form (Pirates of the Caribbean), (Jack Black) from (Nacho Libre - 2006), (Paris Hilton), (Borat), the (X-Men) team, and the worst of them all, the one who did (Johnny Depp) from (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - 2005); he was unbearable and creepy!_The parodies are totally meaningless. Some parody movies, the smart ones, used to mock at real bad points in other movies. But here, forget it. So I didn't even smile at the (Harry Potter) segment. Simply, they selected this time not impersonators to do the job, but old people. That could have meant anything if the actors in the original movie were actually older than their characters!_It mocks at the image goofs of the movies; with the stuntman, of the lion-man king, is so visible as Asian. Or using a doll as a body double; like in the cell scene. But that was outrageous and very embarrassing itself, since the movie is replete with great number of its own goofs. For example, someone is dead then comes back to life, someone is torn-apart then be complete in the next scene, someone is stabbed then no wound of any kind is appearing, Ahhh, the list is awfully LONG; which makes me ask, what kind of nasty drug the movie's 2 writers and directors were on?!!!_When it's as wretched as that; throw in sex jokes. But even if, the ones in here are no less wretched themselves. It hit the rock bottom of cheap triteness, being perversely adolescent, or wildly disgusting, all under the name of comedy?! This is disturbed and disturbing!_The dated jokes about insignificant things, such as ads, TV programs.. etc. Namely, it isn't enough to produce slight gags that only few, only American, viewers, who would understand, No, they must be dull too, so no one would laugh!!_The plot: It's surrealism meets serious idiocy. This movie says a lot about how writing a parody movie has become so easy job to do. It takes only a viewing to some ""actual"" movies, then re-assembling them horrendously. Still, the surprise is that this easy horrendous movie is produced by major studio?!! I know homemade videos that are extremely comic compared to (Epic Movie) and no Hollywood producer cared about them, even for making good money or good comedy!While it is a spoof, it needs a spoof. On second thought, it doesn't deserve the efforts. It's where the only thing with work behind it; is (Carmen Electra)'s make up as (Mystique)!Fairly, I loved factors from it; (Jayma Mays) is one. There is a magically delicate secret about her in this movie; the line between childhood and femininity, she danced on it attractively. Some motion in the first sequence of presenting the main characters seemed good. And the (Punk'd - 2003) part; at last, someone punched (Ashton Kutcher) on the behalf of us, taking revenge from his annoyance. But none of this or that could make up for the painful rest!(Epic Movie) is a course for anyone who wants to make a comedy; as the consummate guide of ""Don't do that again"". Let alone that it fits perfectly as a comedy, a black one, about the production system in Hollywood lately. And finally, it solves the mystery of (David Carradine)'s death.

To hide they end up finding a wardrobe and going to Gnarnia. It is a really terrible parody, and is really unfunny. They just took a bunch of random movies and connected them very loosely and called it a movie. It's more of a bad sketch comedy. The positives of the film are the camera work and special effects, which are pretty good. Also Darrel Hammond of SNL did a terrific imitation of Johnny Depp in Pirate's. The negatives (I'll try to make it brief) are the writing, which is terrible, the acting, where everyone tries their hardest to be funny, and it ends where nobody is, and everything else. I have no idea why somebody would think it would be funny to parody Chronicles of Narnia.

Don't expect anything creative or insightful to come out of this ordeal, it's all pretty much as lazy and obvious as comedy can get. For the most part the supposed parody scenes are carbon copies of the source material, but sometimes the makers also take a break from flat-out theft to bring in some embarrassing bathroom humor. It's truly a fantastic formula, you could churn out a hundred movies a year using it. Want to parody ""Harry Potter""? No problem, copy some of its scenes but make one of the characters fart halfway through. Genius. There are just two things the makers (accidently) got right. Firstly, the Crispin Glover cameo (as Willy Wonka) is amazing. During the two minutes he's on screen the movie almost becomes tolerable, I've never seen such blatant case of an actor being way too good for the movie he's in.

Well, is it bad? For me, obviously not. It was much better than ""Date Movie"" and you can tell the filmmakers that they actually changed some of their plans to make this movie funnier. And it is.I would compare this to ""Monty Python's Holy Grail"" because this film has its shares of laughs and unfunny jokes. The good thing is the movie is really quite refreshing in a way. Why? They never actually spoofed fantasy movies before. Does it make a difference? Yes, it does.What gets better in this movie other than the jokes are the elaborate costumes, the extensive (and wonderful) set designs, special effects, and score, if you care to know about any of that. Although you may think it's a bigger budget than ""Date Movie"", it's surprisingly the same, if that interests you.The jokes in here are funny because it mocks other films, makes obvious clichés and surprisingly turns them the other way, one continuing joke which I found really funny even if it goes throughout the film, a joke they continued from ""Date Movie"" (the obvious stunt double and dummy), and the randomness.The target audience is apparent: Those who have and liked ""Date Movie"" or have seen the films spoofed in here, including ""Nacho Libre,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" ""Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" the ""X-Men"" pictures, ""Superman Returns"", ""The Da Vinci Code"", and a lot more. More or less, put that down to teens.So, if you're a wise adult, you probably wouldn't be surprised not liking this movie. I, on the other hand, am a teen, and it's not surprising enough that I enjoyed it very much so. Also, I like to applaud Jayma Mays for her very funny role and others like Jennifer Coolidge and Faune A. Chambers.If you're a person who doesn't like stupid comedies with some immature and childish jokes, unlike ""Knocked Up"", you should stay very far away from this. Why would you see it?

43,areatw,About as anti-funny as a 'comedy' movie has ever come,1,30 July 2017,"With virtually everyone in agreement that this is a truly dreadful film, I think the real question is whether 'Epic Movie' surpasses 'Disaster Movie' as the most unfunny comedy movie of all time.Both were a struggle to sit through without wanting to punch the TV and both failed to make me laugh once. Neither of them deserves the 1 star I'm unfortunately forced to give them, but at least I've reserved my one stars for films I'd rather gouge my eyes out than watch again (and 'Epic Movie' comfortably falls into that category).Spoof movies like this are never going to be a hit with everyone, but you at least expect something more than a bunch of unimaginative, stale, unfunny gags, and that's all this movie has to offer. 'Airplane' is an example of how to make a successful spoof film that actually makes people laugh rather than roll their eyes.",Epic Movie
44,Beta_Gallinger,"A frighteningly pathetic ""comedy"", probably inferior to every film it parodies!",1,2 September 2007,"Earlier this year, probably while ""Epic Movie"" was playing in theatres, I can't remember how, but I came across its page on this site. I had never heard of it beforehand. Seeing that it was in the Bottom 100, I did not intend to go and see it on the big screen, but after it came into stores, I rented it. In the end, I was not left wondering why this parody movie was so hated, and I'm now joining the thousands of others who have given it the lowest possible vote on IMDb, 1/10! Four orphaned teenagers, Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edward, all win golden tickets to go on an epic adventure! However, while in Willy Wonka's factory, they learn that he wants to use certain body parts of theirs to make candy! They manage to escape, but the evil chocolate factory owner is after them, so they must all find a place to hide! Lucy finds a wardrobe to hide in, but after she enters, she soon finds herself in the land of Gnarnia! Soon, the other three also end up in Gnarnia, and all four of them find themselves in more danger! Their new enemy is the evil ruler of the land, the White B*&#%! Unfortunately, Edward is fooled by this villain and becomes her prisoner, so the others have to try and save him! Why is this parody of several movies from recent years so bad? Well, basically because it's incredibly stupid! Now, comedies can be incredibly stupid in a good way, but ""Epic Movie"" is in a very bad and frightening way! Not every single moment of this movie is absolutely disgusting, but a lot of it is! I usually don't have a problem with crude sex jokes and toilet humour, and there's plenty of that kind of humour in this movie, but here, it's done extremely poorly! Terrible ""gags"" include Willy Wonka wanting to use the main characters for candy (especially the ""nuts"" part), a pregnant Hermione (from the Harry Potter stories, but portrayed a lot differently in this movie) farting, Susan throwing up all over the place, the sex scene with Peter and Mystique (from ""X-Men""), among others! Some of these may be worse than they sound, and the gags that are not outright bad are simply mediocre, so they are of no significance.I haven't seen every movie satirized (I don't know if ""satirized"" is the right word, more like ""ripped off"") in this spoof, but have seen a handful of them, and they're all better than this, even if some are not that good. Not that good is better than horrendous! The ones I haven't seen, I would probably MUCH rather watch any of them than this stinker! Spoof movies can be very funny, and one can enjoy them whether they're a fan of the movie(s) they parody or not. However, with this 2007 flop, it's the opposite! It doesn't matter what you think of the movies lampooned here, because this horrible excuse for a movie is unacceptable either way! What was everyone involved in this steaming pile thinking?! Trust me, if you have any taste whatsoever, and the word ""intelligence"" means something to you, you do NOT want to watch ""Epic Movie""! I don't know how long this will stay in the IMDb Bottom 100, but for however long it stays there, it's a good place for it!",Epic Movie
45,vip_ebriega,When will they make 'Funny Movie'?,1,23 October 2008,"My Take: A one-joke movie? I never thought there were any jokes at all! The tag-line of the posters of EPIC MOVIE (as well as its infamous predecessor DATE MOVIE) says that it was brought to us by 2 of the 6 writers of SCARY MOVIE. Why couldn't they have picked the two good writers? Okay, finding two 'good' writers in any of the SCARY MOVIE films need a little miracle to pull off, but why did it have to be Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? To make this question far more simple, hear this: Did the world really need a disaster that is DATE MOVIE? Well, enough blaming it all on J&B. As long as this things are making money, this guys have a job. And believe me, this is the worst job you can ever land on a Hollywood affiliation. Exhibit A: EPIC MOVIE. After the 'success' (money can do everything, you know?) of DATE MOVIE, J&A felt ""Hey! People got sucked into that one, why not make another pile of crap... I mean movie?"". And so it is. This time, the choice of parody are big 'event' blockbusters. Not sparing STAR WARS, the film also parodies scenes and story lines from THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, THE DA VINCI CODE, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN 2, including lesser not-so-epic films as NACHO LIBRE, CLICK and BORAT. There are more, but it's only a waste to list them all down here. Why is that? Of all the scenes it lifts and references from other movies, none of them really are funny. J&B really have to know that, in making a movie parody, it's not enough to simple get the scenes and re-paste them right here, they have to make them funny. And when I mean funny, I mean hilarious. Not gross, icky and poor excuse for a sex joke. But the real term of funny doesn't seem to be on the J&A vocabulary. In fact, I bet if they even try to look it up, they'll end up with the same old fiasco of EPIC MOVIE. Apparently, their taste of humor are far different from the audiences. Still, what baffles me more than this films being god-awful disasters, is the fact that these films actually make money. Seeing this film actually going somewhere after opening night is a sign of the Apocalypse. Has the standards for entertainment really have gone into this? Looking at the bright side, I bet any of this films won't see the light of day after many years. Someday, a guy runs up to you and asks ""Hey! You remember that movie called EPIC MOVIE?"". And after answering with a ""No"", the guy replies ""Of course you don't! I don't either."" EPIC MOVIE isn't the kind of movie that stands the test of time. In fact, any movie under the shadow of the infamous J&A will never see light in a matter of years. I'd like to make my testimony of hating this film a little longer, but I have a couple more J&A films coming soon, and I plan to save whatever speeches and adjectives I can think of right now for later. For now, I say don't see EPIC MOVIE, and when I mean don't see it, don't wait for it even when it comes to TV. Unless if you, like me, haven't seen a bad movie for a very long time, and really wanting to hate something real bad. Then, in that case, EPIC MOVIE is a movie for you.

Remember the good old days when talented writers created movies like ""Airplane"" and ""The Naked Gun."" The thing is that many of these spoof movies are turning into sketch comedies with actors embarrassing themselves trying to recreate the scenes and lines from much better movies with really bad lines thrown at them. Epic Movie is crammed so full of movie scenes thinly woven into an incoherent and pointless time-line that nothing makes sense much less remotely funny. It's basically struggling actors impersonating other actors with a lot of needless profanity, unnecessary nudity, objectionable references and failed jokes that get more a smirk than a laugh. There is nothing clever here; the film is lacking in imagination and creativity. It's parodying other movies and that's about it. It runs along as if it was made up as it went along with random references tossed it. I got to ask: ""Who approved the money that went into this?"" I tried to listen to the commentary on the DVD, but it's the commentary from another movie; the creators wouldn't even comment on their own film. The only good thing are the closing bloopers. Apparently, the actors thought what they were filming was going to be something special, and they had a lot of fun making it, but if you're going to approve a movie based on the success of two guys in another movie, you might want to read their script first.",Epic Movie

And I have seen some reeeeaaalllll stinkers in my time!Not that it doesn't have some good qualities: as usual, the art direction matches that of the targeted movies as much as possible in a lot of scenes.

The lead girls were obviously supposed to be replacements for Faris and King, and I think they COULD be funny.

This is not actually a movie, it's a parody, or, better said, a series of parodies, put together in on single film. It tries desperately to make fun of every single known brand hoping to make everyone laugh but it doesn't get even close. It doesn't have any essence, any complexity, any idea of a story, just sequences joined together with ""glue"", hoping that something might come out of the final product. It has so many goofs and faults that it makes you wonder if it was really finished. Not to mention the actual characters which are as stupid as a rock can be.

All of the movies they were making fun of are very well known good movies, so it was easy to see where they were making fun of it. Perhaps someone could find it offensive if one of the movies they are joking about is your favorite. But this is the main purpose of a parody, to cut up other films. I really enjoyed how they tied in so many different movies into the one.

53,oneloveall,"Expectedly bad, but not as bad as film snobs will assert",4,20 May 2007,"Well, another year means another installment of the poor man's slapstick franchise, this time being Epic Movie. From a few of the writers who did Scary Movie, and those solely responsible for last year's Date Movie comes this mindless and flimsy foray into the fantasy genre mock-up. It seems to be an unusual thing, how these movies keep getting made despite ending up near the top of every worst-of list, be it critical or popular opinion. One must conclude that the majority of people who go out and give these movies the smallest amount of stars possible are simply not the intended demographic (which, after 5 progressively sleazy incarnations, should be apparent).Because someone is obviously watching these movies. Yes, the demographics of slapstick humor might have taken a severe nosedive over the past ten years, but that is not to say that films like this are not tailor made for the current pseudo-hip-hop youth culture. And it is that young audience who will likely find the most joy in this positively mediocre effort. Epic Movie is even more dedicated in wooing young urban teens then the more vulgar Date Movie was, infusing an unnecessary amount of it's jokes with awkward rap interludes and cameos. It has become more apparent that the intelligence factor for these types of movies has truly gone down to a lowest common denominator, but that still does not give one the right to say there is nothing here for anyone.Yes, Epic Movie suffers as pretty much all the others like it, in the fact that there is about one funny joke for every ten or fifteen that feel positively dirt-cheap. But those occasional jokes that do succeed prove that this comedy does at least in some small way live up to it's genre's promise. Primarily, Willy Wonka and Chronicles of Narnia are parodied, while dozens of characters from more of last year's films pop in and out for very frivolous appearances. The majority will be a bore, even for a group of drunken teenagers, but there are at least half a dozen gags that are still funnier then most of the material non-slapstick comedies provide, and in this pitiful day in age where Epic Movie remains the flagship of this dying sub-genre, where else can we turn too in Hollywood to see overexposed characters, phrases, and scenes get put in their place?",Epic Movie

56,DonFishies,"If the bloopers are the funniest thing about the movie, something is wrong",1,24 May 2008,"After the horrendous Date Movie, I was hesitant to put myself through Epic Movie. It looked nearly exactly what the preceding film was, had a few of the same actors, and the same writers/directors. But the more I missed it, the more I felt the dire need to see the film. And after sitting through the whole film, I almost wish I did not even bother.If the film was merely titled ""Pop Culture References of 2005 and 2006"", I think it would have been a lot more of an appropriate title than Epic Movie. The film lampoons not just epics like The Chronicles of Narnia (where the film finds its key references), Pirates of the Caribbean and Harry Potter, but takes jabs at the likes of the X-Men series, Borat, Snakes on a Plane, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Da Vinci Code and Nacho Libre (going so far as to cast that film's supporting character Héctor Jiménez in a key supporting role).But like Date Movie before it, the film does not parody the films it references as much as it directly steals right from them. Whole lines and sequences are lifted directly out of movies, and even TV shows like Saturday Night Live and Chappelle's Show. Surely either Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer (the still advertised ""2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie"", as they have yet to prove themselves to truly be box office gold) know that the general population of people who would even give this film the time of day would have watched the films and shows these two steal directly from. Or maybe, as this film suggests, the only people who want to watch this movie are people who watch MTV, as the Cribs, Punk'd and numerous music video references would seem to idealize.I think what is most disgusting about this abomination of a film is that these two filmmakers (if we even want to refer to them as that) are plagiarizing the work of others. In the Scary Movie series (and going so far back as the work of Mel Brooks and David Zucker's earlier, non-Weinstein produced work), despite some of the films being worse than terrible, the filmmakers still attempted to give some semblance of originality to the references and parodies of films they were doing. They were simply not copying and pasting someone else's work and calling it their own. In the real world, if someone does that, they can be fired or expelled from school, and are practically blacklisted for the rest of their lives. Why is it that Friedberg and Seltzer are somehow allowed to do this criminal act? Has Fox somehow given them a pardon just for the fact of giving them some cheap profits in the Winter movie season, and a rather easily profitable Unrated DVD release? Well, Meet the Spartans comes out on DVD in a few weeks, and it looks to be on about the same page.But it could also simply be for the fact that the jokes Friedberg and Seltzer come up with themselves are almost not funny at all. I smirked at the preppy school X-Men send-up, and a few other choice scenes, but the majority of what I could tell was original work, was not funny at all. Maybe Fox gives them a pass on stealing other people's stuff just because their own work is not funny? Or maybe they are just being duped into thinking it was original, and not copyrighted by somebody else? They must know that work is being stolen. Why else would the White Bitch character (played by Jennifer Coolidge) talk about her evil plan, only to have another character joke about how it was directly ripped nearly point for point from Superman Returns? What I found peculiar was that for such a ridiculously written film, so many recognizable faces showed up to ""act"" in it. Coolidge, Fred Willard, Tony Cox, Crispin Glover, Carmen Electra, David Carradine and Kevin McDonald have all acted in some really funny movies, and somehow, it seems that bringing them all here might give the movie some sort of credibility in being funny. Only their acting leaves a lot to be desired. Yeah, Willard tries for a bit, but no one else seems particular enthusiastic that they are a part of this production. They look like they are waiting for their money, and then are going to run off with it.They also seem to have put more money into sets, costumes and music too (when it is not just being taken from the top chart of 2006). I was actually rather amused by how much work went into some of these things, and how it looks like the filmmakers were given so much more money to make this movie than they were for Date Movie. Did Fox really have that much faith in them? I digress however. I got actual laughs in the film courtesy of a completely unrecognizable Darrell Hammond as Captain Jack Swallows (a parody on Johnny Depp's Oscar-nominated Jack Sparrow). He is pound for pound, the funniest thing the movie has to offer, and nails each and every moment he has with an amount of perfection completely devoid from the rest of the production. I am unsure if Friedberg and Seltzer wrote Hammond's lines (they look more improvised than anything), but if they did, I concede that they might have some sort of talent if they get the right actor to read them off. I laughed a lot during the bloopers shown through the credits as well. It just looked funnier to screw up the terrible lines than to actually say them.And if the bloopers are the funniest thing about this so-called comedy, I think there might be a problem. Hopefully Meet the Spartans has more originality, and less plagiarizing. Otherwise Friedberg and Seltzer should be looking at some fines to pay.1.5/10.",Epic Movie

Blazing Saddles was a parody of Western movies. Hot Shots was a parody of Top Gun. And so on. What did these movies have that ""Epic Movie"" didn't? Well first of all they were movies with an attention to the plot, a vision of how to properly portray the parody and actual jokes. These jokes ranged from clever visual gags, to clever wordplay, to just ridiculous situations. Epic Movie had none of those. Instead what we got was gross out humor, jokes that are stretched way too long and pop culture references. Lots of pop culture references. You know, things that a year later are no longer relevant or are, in and of themselves, not funny?Here's an example, they're ""spoofing"" the ""Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" or the first Narnia movie.

Are you laughing yet because this is the formula for the rest of the movie. Something happens, pop culture reference. Something else happens, pop culture reference. Something follows and is followed by a pop culture reference. These aren't ""jokes"".An actual example of the movie is the Satyr, I can't be bothered to check his name, is showing one of the main characters around his place. And it suddenly turns into an episode of MTV Cribs. Where's the joke? The only purpose is for people to look at that scene and say, ""I know where that's from!"".

70,TheHonestCritic,"This is an example of a ""movie"" where the title serves as a lie.",1,5 January 2020,"""Epic Movie"" (2007), this is another rookie mistake that people make in the world nowadays; calling something ""epic"" before it actually occurs. Probably the area suffering the most is the industry of film and television. That's really starting to get on my nerves, where someone says: ""this is going to be epic"", or ""I'm looking forward to an event of epic proportions"", and so on. If you have the nerve to call something ""epic"" before it happens, then you had better be accurate with your predictions! What happens if the event, or movie, is a total bust? Well then, you'll sound and look pretty stupid, wouldn't you? Any way, I've made my point, now let's get to the review (rant) of this ""film"". It's probably no surprise that this is one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. Lazily pointless story, horrible acting, cheap special effects, boring sets/locations, and finally a cliched predictable dull soundtrack to tie this diarrhea stain together. The story, or lack thereof, is just a cliched plethora of subplots with a cliched boring narrative and cliched snore fest that goes absolutely nowhere. Now don't get me wrong, I love parodies when they're done right. But this ""movie"" does it wrong in every sense of the word, and then some! Plot? What plot? What did I just watch? It's like I hit ""play"", watched the ""film"", nothing happened, it ended, who cares? Kind of like the train wreck known as ""Diner"" (1982)! This ""movie"" has some of the worst direction that I have ever seen. Keep in mind, this ""movie"" has two directors. Yet, they still somehow managed to screw it up! Speaking of the film crew, what in the world were they on while making this ""movie""? Whatever they were smoking/drinking, they must have overdosed. What brain operated by a flickering bulb, with broken gears would be stupid enough to green-light this garbage?! A parody movie like this had potential to be funny, but they forgot one thing: the humor. The real tagline of this ""film"" should be: ""a comedy movie, but without the humor"". As far as the acting goes, it is so dreadful, that it almost should be illegal! Most of the so-called performances are so bad, that it leads you to question: ""what were you thinking?!"" Or another question, ""what kind of direction were the actors and actresses given?"" As for the special effects, the majority of them look cheap, cheesy and generic. Therefore, the special effects have not aged well. The sets/locations look dull and boring, and most of the interior scenes were obviously filmed in a studio. When it's obvious you can tell that a movie is filmed in a studio, that's a problem! Isn't it? Finally, the musical score is cliched, predictable and tired. No part of the score is memorable at all. ""Epic Movie"" (which it isn't), is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It angers me how bad it is, but it's also boring in some places. Those are the two worst things a movie or show can do to me, bore and anger me. This ""film"" is so bad, that I'm embarrassed for anyone subjected into making it. Even though they don't deserve any sympathy, they knew what they were signing up for! ""Epic Movie"" should be required viewing for film students in college, so they can learn the basics on how not to make a movie, to avoid ruining the future of cinema! There is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this ""film"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating, my true rating is 0 stars. The only positive thing I can gather from watching this ""movie"", like most other bad movies I've seen, is that I'll never have to watch it again. Stay away from ""Epic Movie"", trust me, I'm saving you 93 minutes of your time!",Epic Movie
71,PoisonKeyblade,A perfect spoof film,8,10 February 2007,"If another person ever compares this far superior film to Date Movie again, I swear I'll hurl all over them. Epic Movie is exactly the kind of film a spoof movie should befunny as hell, not taking itself too seriously, contains decent acting, and makes constant references to pop culture and other fields. In my eyes, it was a comedic masterpiece, and there wasn't a moment where I stopped laughing. By the end of the film, I was completely breathless.The characters in Epic Movie are your usual stereotypes, but this time around, each of the actors brings something hilarious to each role. Even the brief cameos, which could have gone badly, work extremely well; in one of the movie's funniest scenes, David Lehre, in a spoof of Punk'd and Ashton Kutcher, yells ""shwam, shwam, shwam!"" as he 'punks' one of the characters. The movie also features lots of 'in-jokes' if you've seen a lot of movies. For instance, Kal Penn of the film Harold and Kumar go to White Castle says ""It feels like I've been there before"" when the White Bitch says she's taking him to her White Castle.The spoofs are also well-executed, and a lot of them are done with flashy music. Crispin Glover brings an incredible energy to Willy Wonka in his few scenes that it's a wonder he wasn't given more to work with. Darrell Hammond is uproarious as Captain Jack Swallows in a spoof of Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.Overall, Epic Movie is the perfect spoof movie in every way, if spoofs are your cup of tea. Don't listen to what everyone else says! Epic Movie is a hilarious, enjoyable, fun little film that spoofs Hollywood's latest Blockbusters in an excellent manner. I actually liked this better than Scary Movie 4 and equally as much as my favorite film in that franchise, Scary Movie 3.",Epic Movie

Due to the success of the SCARY MOVIE franchise, the film-makers decided to come up with other ones like DATE MOVIE and this one. It looks like that the writers got their ideas from Mad Magazine, The Far Side, or they must be watching too much cartoons. The film blatantly rips-off all those well-known and insignificant movies (such as CLICK). This is what I call drivel with a capital D. The writers put all these references and spoofs in the plot at random. Here's the worst part, all those sick and twisted jokes, especially ones related to bestiality such as the true parents of Mr. Thumnis, the fact that the beaver and Mr. Thumnis are gay, and Also the Liman's true parents. Yuck! My mother was right, this film IS epic trash. This film is a far-cry from what the other films are spoofing, it is the title that seems to deceive the audience. I'd rather watch 300.

It relies way too hard on just making fun of the source materials with no thought, care, or originality whatsoever. All the jokes are either relentlessly immature or have been said by audiences before this film was even made. Nothing is fresh and nothing is funny. The film doesn't even try to be clever. If anything, the attempts at humor are cringeworthy at best. Hell, every single source material here is at least 10 times funnier than this film will ever be. Doesn't help that everything flows poorly, making an already hard thing to sit through that much harder. It's close to unbearable. I personally think a parody movie can work if the jokes aren't rehashed and randomly crude so that only 12-13 year old teenagers could find any sort of enjoyment out of, but that is so far from the case here, that it makes the moon seem like it's 5 minutes away. If you couldn't tell already, I recommend everyone to avoid this like the plague. It's dumb and nothing more. As I said, it could've been funny if the writers knew what they were doing, but since they clearly didn't, it literally never is. Go watch every source material instead, because watching all of those back to back is more fun than watching less than a minute of this crap.

After hearing good and bad reviews of this film, we decided to watch for ourselves. Well, to be honest, the film was a mess, the jokes make no sense and are repeated at random, the only shock on the use of a midget was the midget actually agreeing to be in the movie. The 4 main characters were awfully shallow and weak minded and seemed unable to think of a joke worthy of even reflecting off in thinking of bad movies. Instead of trying to parody things, they just got the same joke from the film and copied it (This being seen mostly by the Borat ripoff character, the only word changed was Gnarnia (They didn't name this because of legal conditions, just because they couldn't think of anything to parody except the magical silent g that does not parody but just adds another letter to the word so cleverly thought up by whats his face). Some of the stuff in there was not a parody, just a scene to show stripper pirates, fawns and mutants. The nudity was pointless and stupid, their not being a use of the two women who show all in this shame fest of a movie, and many a people with horns who bear their ugly face in the movie, proving they struggled to hire real people to the roles of the people in the film.TL;DR This movie is repetitive, non-parodicial (I made a new word in disgust), and just rips off the original movie.

What do they have to lose they already lost respect from almost everyone.There work has already rubbed off on another Scary Movie writer. Craig Mazin who made Superhero Movie is trying there way to. I am yet to see Superhero Movie. But it does look like another piece of trash.The humor in this is terrible. The jokes go on and on and on. Not funny at all. If you think watching a Da Vinci Code spoof with break dancing is funny then you will like it. But for me it was terrible. The worse movie to come out in 2007.I don't recommend this. I wouldn't even recommend to someone i hate. The only reason you should be caught watching this is to see how bad it is for yourself.So we have yet another spoof movie from two of the worse directors/writers in movies today.

Though you know most of the parodies, they are slightly different. It is an okay film but too short, it might be one of the shortest movie. When you watch it, you hoped that the directors had put more action, parodies, made it funnier and longer. There are some slight parodies like the ""Superman"" scene, it is just only for one part, it is been wished that the directors could extent the parodies.

It manages to cobble together a coherent storyline, and hilariously mishmashes characters and settings from the blockbuster movies of 2006. I am actually glad these trite, mediocre, yet inexplicably lucrative movies are made fun of and torn to pieces by ""Epic Movie."" The movie is definitely weird, filled with careless non sequiturs, shoddy editing, and strange, inappropriate hip-hop songs and references; yet it is because of, rather than in spite of these poorly-done and weird cuts, that ""Epic Movie"" is so enjoyable. One of the best scenes involves a fight scene with a kung-fu body double that looks absolutely nothing like the main actor. Dismembered limbs magically reappear as though the character was not hurt. Comedy needs to be weird, over-the-top, and nonsensical. ""Epic Movie"" is all of these, and as a result ends up being a classic of weird comedies.The actors are actually competent and very funny. The beautiful Jayma Mays is excellent as the exaggeratedly stupid, goofy, and childlike Lucy. She clearly understood how to make this character weird, surreal and memorable. Faune Chambers is somewhat of a foil for Lucy's antics. I loved the credibly cowardly character of Peter. Crispin Glover, master of the bizarre is wonderful as a creepy and unnerving Willy Wonka. Darrell Hammond is absolutely spot-on as a parody of Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow; he has an eye for detail and mimics the character perfectly.This movie is not well crafted in terms of a smooth plot line or story structure, but it's weird enough to work.

89,guyfromjerzee,A sign of the Apocalypse,2,19 February 2007,"The fact that this horrid piece of trash got the green light is definitely a sign of the apocalypse. I'm a big fan of the parody, as a genre. We've seen great examples of it in films like ""Airplane"" and ""Kentucky Fried Movie."" Fast forward about twenty-five years later and what do we have? ""Epic Movie."" How anyone can laugh at something this juvenile is completely foreign to me. First of all, it's supposed to be a parody of ""epic movies,"" and almost no epic movies are parodied! Do you consider ""Snakes on a Plane"" to be an epic movie? Do you consider ""Nacho Libre"" to be an epic movie? And many of the films being made fun of aren't that great in the first place. The first rule of the parody genre is to poke fun at ""good movies""! You don't insult bad movies, because a bad movie is an insult within itself! Duh! The filmmakers didn't even make honest attempts to make each gag funny. In the parody of ""Snakes,"" an amateurish black actor plays Samuel L. Jackson and repeatedly yells out ""I'm tired of these G.D. snakes on the G.D. plane!"" Obviously, he didn't say ""G.D.,"" but the point is in the real movie he says, ""I'm tired of these motherf**kin' snakes on the motherf**kin' plane!"" But of course, that can't happen because ooooh, then the film will be slapped with an R-rating. The idea of people under the age of 17 not being permitted to see this trash is positively frightening to the studio. If you ask me, no one with an I.Q. OVER 17 should be permitted to see this movie. What I'm basically saying is the joke doesn't work because he's not even saying the same line! The joke would've worked if, first of all, the directors hired a much better actor who does a much better Sam Jackon impersonation, and second of all, used the line that was in the original movie. Because there has to be a ""truth"" to every joke! Speaking of bad actors, the cast consists primarily of amateurs. The directors probably could've snagged better actors from a high school play. There are some exceptions like Kal Penn, Tony Cox, and Fred Willard (who has the one funny scene in the movie), but obviously they're not given much to work with. I assumed at first it was Crispin Glover that played Willy Wonka in the parody of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" but then I said to myself, ""No! Crispin does a movie, like, once a decade."" Sure enough, it was him. Say what you want about Crispin's real life persona, but he usually has much better taste in films (i.e.: ""Back to the Future"" or ""River's Edge""). He must've been horribly desperate for a paycheck when he volunteered to participate in this amateur hour. Hector Jimenez, the actor who played Jack Black's friend in ""Nacho Libre,"" also has a role in the film. It makes me glad that his character said few lines in ""NL."" Obviously, English is not Hector's first language, and he butchers every line of dialogue with his strained delivery. I always say it's important when you do comedy to hire actors who speak English as a first language. If that sounds racist, I'm sorry, but unless you're playing a Harpo-Marx-type role, comedy is all about inflection. Watch the movie ""Chasing Papi"" if you want to see a good example of an American comedy being executed badly by actors who don't speak the language very well.About the only incentive to watching ""Epic Movie"" is getting the chance to see Carmen Electra prance around half-naked throughout most of the flick. But even that welcome eventually gets worn out, since we later get ""treated"" to a scene where Carmen transforms into a fat woman with a unibrow. What is this trend with making Carmen do something horribly unappealing in every comedy she does? In ""Scary Movie"" there's a scene where she farts. In ""Scary Movie 4"" there's a scene where she takes a gigantic dump. Is this a conspiracy to stop men from fantasizing about Carmen? Sheesh! If crude, brainless gags about puking and peeing is your cup of tea, then ""Epic Movie"" may be the film for you.

Kal Penn is the only actor I remember in the cast, and I'm sure he can do better movies than this.As for the humour in this movie, how did it get by with a PG-13?

This whole movie basically abuses some big talents in small cameo roles in the hopes that stars like; Crispin Glover, David Carradine, Carmen Electra, and Jennifer Coolidge will draw a crowd. Trust me when I say the talent was wasted. The highest point in the movie is the Harry Potter spoof but that didn't take more than 3 minutes and it was over. None of the other parodies made a lasting impression on me. Most of the jokes delt with sex and beastiality on a very immature level. Who is to blame?

95,simonparker1990,Worst Movie of 2007 already?,1,11 February 2007,"When you hear the title Epic Movie and also hear that its a spoof, you automatically assume that it will be spoofing such movies as Lord of the Rings, Lawrence of Arabia, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven etc. In this respect when I first heard the title I will admit I was a tiny bit intrigued. And then the trailer was released, my respect for the movie and its concept went dramatically downhill from there until now I sit before you having seen a movie that really, really, really is the most excruciatingly example of poorness that you will ever find on the cinema this year! You see Epic Movie decides to spoof such movies as The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lione, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Snakes on a Plane, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest, Superman Returns, X-Men: The Last Stand, Borat, Nacho Libre and oh way too much more as well. I can accept movies taking the mickey out of other movies, admittedly I quite like the Scary Movie franchise, sure Scary Movie 4 was a bit of a letdown, but that movie at least has some inventive ideas around it. This movie didn't have one half decent or remotely funny idea at all. When you sit there wishing you were watching the real Nacho Libre when you're watching the Nacho Libre spoof on this you know there's something horribly wrong with the movie. This fails at everything, the idea is pathetic, the cast are pathetic, the jokes are pathetic, hell even the sets are pretty pathetic. And that's the key word for this movie, pathetic. Its like a hyperactive five year old jumping in front of you for the entire movie, its basically screaming at you for attention, and no matter how much you ignore it it just keeps coming back for more. Its a mesh of horrid jokes ranging from slightly (and emphasis on slightly as I didn't even smirk) funny, a beaver getting kicked, to pretty bad (a Mystique scene where a man wants her to become a fat woman), to excruciatingly awful (the horrible Kribs sequence) to just plane suicidally awful, the Punk'd spoof. Epic Movie is neither epic, nor funny, its just a wretched thing that's wondered onto cinema screens and unfortunately the morons of our society have decided to lap it up, which undoubtedly means Epic Movie 2 is being wrote as we speak, god help us all! The major problems with Epic Movie fall into the fact it is not funny at all, ever, not even a teensy weensy bit amusing. And another fault is that it dares to take the mickey out of things that are funny in their original movies. Borat for example, now the mickey take here is ludicrous, and actually I'm still baffled as to how Borat got into this movie at all. But sure enough a man trying to act like Borat shows up, imagine Borat but without a joke and that's what he's like here, just simply walking on for the hell of it. The movie also decides to laugh at Johnny Depp's performance in Pirates 2, except here it seems like a man doing a poor Keith Richards impersonation more than anything else. The scenes where he waddles about singing an odd Pirate rap didn't make me laugh, they just made me sit there with my mouth hanging wide open as to why I am enduring this monstrosity. Then it tries laughing at the movie Click, I haven't seen Click so I can't really comment, but I still don't understand how they tried to take the mick out of it. They even repeated the slow down time to see a woman run joke in this movie, and it was lame here. But the movies ultimate, ultimate mistake is daring to try and laugh at Snakes on a Plane. It falls flat on its face, dramatically so. Whoever let these people try and write something funny about Snakes on a Plane needs to be forced to watch this movie back to back! I mean, what's even slightly amusing about a man trying to be like Samuel L Jackson and repeatedly saying ""I've had it with these goddamn snakes on this goddamn plane."" And saying it at least ten times in a row! My other big moan before I call it a day and try to recuperate from watching this thing called a movie, I will basically slag off the actors as much as possible. First up is Kal Penn as Edmund, now he's probably the least eye gougingly annoying of the lot, but by the time he's on screen with Jack Swallow (the annoying version of Jack Sparrow) you get sick of him. Adam Campbell is definitely the worst male in the movie, he is just ridiculous. He does a brief Superman parody that irritates more than anything else, and the fact his ludicrous English accent just sounds well ludicrous made me despise him even more. The two lead girls are equally as awful and both deserve to stand in a corner, and bow their heads in shame. But the two cast members I'm still amazed that signed on are Crispin Glover and Jennifer Coolidge. Glover is in a disturbing but unfunny parody of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Coolidge tries to scrape some laugh as the main villain, she fails dramatically. Why these two talented actors signed on is above me, and why they even read the script still amazes me as well.Epic Movie is another front runner for worst movie of 2007. I thought Employee of the Month was bad, Employee of the Month looks like a masterpiece compared to this wretched movie. Avoid at all costs, no burn every cinema showing it down, it made stop the spreading of this plague like film.",Epic Movie

The script absolute filth. the jokes they piled on top of each other like a pile of crap and none of them were funny. the characters they were just atrocious and don't even get me started on the acting. worse than awful a mix of bad taste stupidity and unbelievable neglect to the human intellect. simplistic and terrible, poorly written. it looked like it took the writers about an hour or less to complete the script. now i know the journey always seems easier for the one who hadn't taken it but putting my self in place of Aaron and Jason, the writers of the film, i would either spend some time on writing something smarter or change the subject and back away from the genre of parody. and the saddest part it had kal penn in it. after seeing him in harold and kumar i wasn't expecting to see him in such a stupid movie, in case he did not know, it's called turning down the role, lots of famous actors do it. and unlike will smith, who dropped the role of neo and regretted it afterwards, kal penn would have been proud if he did drop the role. one more thing before i leave.

It was certainly not a classic parody movie or even that good, but is was pretty funny and not completely horrible. Some of the plot was very runny. There were some parts where there was a lot of laughter, and long periods of time where there were only a few chuckles. Sometimes it was just too weird...As far as comparing the movie to Date Movie goes, it was better.

The rest of the actors are all mediocre, even Carmen Electra, who usually makes laugh in movies like Scary Movie (which I'll review some time later). The spoofs aren't even funny, but you do get a laugh once in a while, still, this film sucks. If you're at the video store and you are searching for something to rent, do NOT rent this.

Then the snakes in the plane scene was also hilarious, although xmen and nacho libre and harry potter spoofs were kinda dumb. I felt it could have done much more good if it hadn't put narnia as the central spoof. Pirates spoof was good, with the guy spoofing jack sparrow doing a superb job of it.

Walking through a wardrobe, they discover the world of Gnarnia, which is ruled by the White Bitch. Meeting up with characters such as Harry Potter and Captain Jack Swallows, the newly reunited family must team up with Also, a wise-but-horny lion to stop the army of the White Bitch.So two of the six writers of Scary Movie (as we keep on being reminded in the trailers so we don't forget) have come up with another 'parody' movie, but is it really necessary? The story is awful and lacks just about everything. The characters are made to be dumb for cheap laughs (yet again), the acting is a joke as none of the cast could act if their very lives depended on it and the direction was torturous. The worst part is the jokes and the funny scenes, they weren't even funny at all. There really is nothing to review since the whole movie is just a joke.I watch these movies to see whether it can get any worse and they do.

104,mjplysaght,I first watched this movie when I was 13. What a way to ruin your childhood.,1,3 February 2017,"Where do I begin with this?I remember thinking Scary Movie 3 was mildly funny when I was 12 or 13, so I rented this movie on DVD. I was gullible at that age to honestly think that this movie was 'epic', whereas in actual fact, this film is a low budget, unfunny, poorly written, disgusting parody of all the films that were popular around the time of filming this 'film'.Every scene has to incorporate a horrendous parody of a popular film at the time, such as The Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, Borat, Snakes On A Plane, etc. The central parody is The Chronicles Of Narnia where they try to retell the story while cramming in too many pop culture references that couldn't possibly be in any way dated in 10 years time. (*sarcasm*)The writers/directors seem to be under the impression that humour stems from throwing in as many references as possible. The same with gross-out humour. It was really disturbing to look at half of the time.I genuinely remember thinking one scene in the film was funny (or rather, the trailer) and it's when Jayma Mays' character discovers the iconic wardrobe from Narnia, opens it and a tonne of junk and random items come bursting out of it and fall on top of her. Not a hilarious joke, but funny when I was 13. The scene plays in the actual film, the junk falls on top of Jayma Mays, and then in the next shot, a fully nude woman comes running out of the wardrobe. Errrrr.....what?Just comes to show you what the target audience (if one exists) is. Idiots with ADD, low attention spans, sexually repressed and entertained by gratuitous sex and gross scenes.Clearly the actors involved in this film needed the cash because I cannot see any benefits on an actor's career in the long run, after being associated with this disaster.",Epic Movie
105,walken_on_sunshine,Like Watching A Sketch Comedy Series,7,16 January 2007,"The creators of Date Movie bring us an actually decent spoof film the one and only Epic Movie.While certain things are stale and lame most of the spoofs and jokes are funny and therefore the good humor outweighs the bad humor making Epic Movie a pretty enjoyable experience.I think for the most part the acting is good very TV sitcom like which i find hilarious.They make fun of every hit movie in the book X-Men,Superman,Pirates Of The Caribbean,Narnia,Harry Potter etc. and for the most part they do a good job and create some funny spoofs.Quite like Date Movie Epic Movie has a lot of random humor and seems to attempt at trying a Family Guy style and while that made Date Movie fail it makes Epic Movie pass because the jokes don't come out of nowhere and have a stupid punchline or no punchline at all the prime reason Date Movie sucked so badly.This is kind of like watching a sketch comedy series and although they have a thin main storyline that links things together for the most part you're wondering what's going to be spoofed next so you really don't care much about the actual characters.Date Movie also had a very sketch comedy feel but more of a low budget sketch comedy show like Comedy Inc or The Underground (lots of unfulfilled potential)whereas Epic Movie has good quality spoofs and is more of a Mad TV,Saturday Night Live feel.Date Movie made spoofs to a lot of things that weren't well known so to most the spoofs seemed like they made no sense but Epic Movie was smart and spoofed films almost everyone has seen therefore it is a lot funnier to people and they actually understand the jokes.Is this as good as Airplane!, Space Balls, or South Park?Certainly not but it's not as bad as Plump Fiction or Date Movie it's on the same fence as The Scary Movie franchise which I say is a huge step up from the directors last bomb (Date Movie).Overall i enjoyed the film it's funny not overly hilarious but there are quite a few laughs enjoy it for what it is.",Epic Movie

This is comparable to the excrement of bottom feeding creatures.People who actually have talent and appear in this movie: Crispin Glover, Darrell Hammond, Fred Willard, David Carradine and Kevin Mcdonald.This movie proves two distinct things:1.) Jennifer Coolidge will appear in anything.2.) So will Carmen Electra.To say this is a parody movie is an insult to parody movies. What in the hell were Crispin Glover and David Carradine doing in this? And Kevin Mcdonald's paychecks must have really dried up since ""Kids in the Hall"" ended. Even with Coolidge forever immortalized as the ""MILF"" i've seen her in funny roles, wicked roles and even charming ones. She's capable of a lot more than this and the dreaded ""Pootie Tang"". If I can find something nice to say it's that her wardrobe and hair were pretty cool.Kal Penn, in a rare time out from stoner films takes on the only role capable of making him look dumber. Adam Campbell annoyed the living s**t out of me, and most of the other supporting cast barely put out a detectable pulse, and therefore aren't worth the mention.However, as much as it pains me, there were two parts of this movie which I actually thought didn't suck.The first, the fight with the ""monk"" and Fred Willard. I thought it was actually kinda funny they way they kept switching between Fred Willard, and the Asian stunt guy. (No mistake, it was meant to be obvious.) And the second was Darrell Hammond, who actually escapes the talent sucking soul that is this film, and does a pretty good Jack Sparrow impression. (Jack Swallows.) I couldn't tell it was Hammond at all, he's got the look, voice and mannerisms. If you add up the screen time for those two parts, it amounts to less than ten minutes. Everyone in my aforementioned ""talent"" category should be ashamed of themselves, and be sentenced to some sort of community service for appearing in this mental sodomization.",Epic Movie

I do not think that this movie deserves a ten like I gave it, but I gave it a ten so the rating would go up, but it doesn't look like its working. This movie is bad, but not that bad. It does not deserve the credit it got. So, in the end, I give this movie a ten. I think that it should really be a 7, but I gave it a ten. This was a funny movie. 10/10.",Epic Movie

Four orphans get golden tickets to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory where Willy uses humans to make his candy. They escape through a wardrobe leading to Gnarnia, which is in eternal winter due to control by the White B*tch. A prophecy says that the four orphans should be the one to end her reign and restore peace. This movie spoofs many films from 2006 in a sh*tty manner, but mainly focuses on The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The references are not funny and often don't even make sense. They also seem to toe the line of plagiarism quite often. Honestly this movie is just garbage in every way. Writing was almost non-existent, and the acting was bad as well. This movie relied hard on sight gags and references and did both terribly. Just everything was bad. Don't ever watch this film. EVER!",Epic Movie

Where this movie suffers is very weak writing. The story relies upon visual gags that just aren't original or even interesting. The plot is not logical and it serves only as a mechanism to jump from visual parody to parody. Some of the parody scenes just seem to be tossed in as an afterthought. The Superman parody doesn't affect story flow at all and it just isn't funny. The Borat parody is equally pointless. Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that the writers have mocked so many other movies and couldn't find anything to develop into humor.If you liked the Scary Movie series and Date Movie, don't assume Epic Movie comes close to living up. It doesn't. I only gave this three stars to see if I could give it the best review on the site. I can't give it just one star because I did laugh about 5 times.

And while not QUITE as bad, it is still pretty lame.The story spoofs (well, references) ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" by having four orphans (played either annoyingly or blandly by the four lead actors) as they travel through a magical wardrobe locked away in Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory (did I really say that?) where they soon discover they must save Gnarnia from the clutches of The White Bitch. Ha....ha....HA!!This movie is, quite simply, not funny. The movie (AHEM) spoofs James Bond, ""Pirates of the Carribbean"", ""Snakes on a Plane"", Paris Hilton, Harry Potter, The X-Men and also throws in references to MySpace and MTV. Could someone PLEASE TELL ME WHAT ANY OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE EPIC GENRE?! If you were going to spoof the epic movie, what would you choose? ""Ben-Hur""? What about ""Lawrence of Arabia""? Even ""Chronicles"" loosely fits the epic genre. Where does Paris Hilton fit into any of these films? Or for that matter, this genre? Well, she is epically stupid but I don't think that counts.I will be fair. The Willy Wonka parody with Crispen Glover is actually kind of funny. Reimagining Wonka as break-dancing pervert is amusing but it's a pretty fleeting cameo.This cast reeks of ""they only did it for the money."" Fred Willard is a funny guy but is made out so ridiculously. I also find another trademark of these two hacks to be wearing pretty frigging thin. The constant references to woman's breasts is just getting tired. What's so funny about them anyway unless you think it's amusing to see a blue colored Carmen Electra have her boobs inflated to three times their size. It's more weird then it is funny.Bottom line?

This reminds me of a bad plot of date movie. Even I think some of the cast from that date movie made it into this movie except Alyson. I do like the spoof on superman getting the bullet in his eye that is kind of backwards play on things, but really this film lacks any originality and reminds me of an MTV made movie or one of those things you see at the MTV video movie awards you know.

This movie is bad....really, really bad.I have always loved the spoof movies such as ""Airplane"", ""Scary Movie"", or ""Naked Gun"". What made these films classic were the nonstop assault on the funny bone with continuous sight gags, wacky comments, and ridiculous situations. This movie just stumbled from the get-go and left the audience to try to find any bit of humor in any manner they could from what they were being presented on the screen. Any joke that was offered was grade school humor and was overplayed and extended to the point of being annoying. How many stupid spoof rap videos can be randomly inserted into scenes of a movie? How many times can one person get kicked between the legs? It was if the movie intended to be played by second graders in a school pageant! And even that would have been a major improvement! As for the actual acting (if you can call it that), it seems that the cast just wanted to get over with filming and collect their pay.

132,solidgameboy12-1,"Second Verse, Not like the first.",3,2 March 2007,"The last time I saw a parody film that I thought was surprisingly okay was Date Movie. I gave that an 8 out of 10. People probably thought I was something of insane, but I actually enjoyed it. I thought it was funnier than Scary Movie 4, for sure. Jason Friedburg and Aaron Seltzer must have realized that their movies make a nice mint, because they made a sequel titled Epic Movie. I guess what I thought was funny for Date Movie, they just duplicated with different movies, and the result, probably to their dismay, was just not good. Here's the story: 4 orphans (Kal Penn, Adam Campbell, Jayma Mays & Faune A. Chambers) who have no real connection to each other, since they lived in different parts of the world and coincidently, live in different movies (Kal's in Nacho Libre, Adam is the Superhero parody, Jayma is the Da Vinci Code, and Faune is Snakes On A Plane), have all met based on the finding of a chocolate bar, which leads to Willy's Factory. Willy is maniacal, and wishes to use the orphans for his candy. They escape into the large wardrobe into Gnarnia, where the four discover they are the only ones who can save this mystical world.The movie has great ideas, but does not execute them well. Some ""jokes"" (If you could call them jokes) have slight humor only in that they are recognized in Pop culture today, such as the Snakes on a Plane reference where Samuel L. Jackson (Only an actor, not really him) states that due to the internet, the only thing he's most recognized for is his famous quote which he repeats to annoying affect. By the 3rd shouting of this quote, it started to become obnoxious that the writers have indeed, made their point. Why continue? Also, do not be deceived by the title. It says Epic, and many would define ""Epic"" in the sense of film as something that is legendary, such as a lot of the classic films like ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Gone with the Wind"", or ""The Sound of Music"", where the budget was no where near as important as the story telling, and people preferred the Quality of the movie instead of how much money went into it. What the creators define Epic is any movie out now that is overblown to large proportions based on Controversy, content, recognized quotes, or anything else that would not define a film connoisseur's taste for what Epic would be.Some of the humor, and by ""some"", I'm really trying to find points that are funny, can actually provide a laugh, but expect a ""Ha- Ha"" moment. Not a laugh that you would get from watching Airplane! or a classic comedy Jerry Zucker film. The film parody section, like the Zombie section or the Family Travel film section in Hollywood has been played to death. This stuff is beginning to come off as a get rich quick for stringing a bunch of movies together with no real plot connecting them into a 80 - 90 minute film. There are much funnier parody films out there. Chances are you have probably seen them already. Go pull them out of your tape case or re-rent it and have a bowl of popcorn and sit home and watch a movie. Trust me, you'll have more fun listening and probably quoting Leslie Nielsen's movies than sitting through this ""Movie"", if it can be called that.I rate this a 3/10.",Epic Movie

I should have listened to my gut instinct and waited until the movie had been properly review by qualified film critics.This movie is ""crap"" in every sense of the word! There's really no story in this movie, so the ""synopsis"" follows four ""orphans"" as they come together, discover they're brothers and sisters, and stop the evil White B@#!$ who allegedly killed their parents. From that point on, there is no plot. It's just taking some really good movies and turning them into crap.I would say hilarity ensues, but there was very little in this movie that was hilarious. Most of the jokes were crude, obnoxious, or gross-out. There were a few things that made me laugh, such as Mr. Tumnus' crib, Captain Jack Swallows, the White Queen's turbo sled, and even adding some Imperial stormtroopers to the Queen's army. Unfortunately, these jokes aren't enough to save the movie.It seems all spoof movies these days are about being rude and gross. The movies being spoofed are just in there as a backdrop for the movie's ""dumb time."" Half the movies spoofed in this movie, such as Borat, Nacho Libre, Willy Wonka and Click, aren't even epics.

And when the writers were on the cusp of putting together something humorous, like the age of the Harry Potter cast, they couldn't leave well enough alone, and unnecessarily went over the top.This movie was so unentertaining that it (combined with an entire tub of popcorn) made it necessary for me to leave the theatre 10 minutes before I could have sneaked into ""Departed"", just to cleans myself of the experience.Don't even rent this one.",Epic Movie

I could leave it at that and hope you take my advice and save yourself the $8.00, but I know many of you will see it anyway. ""Oh, but the trailer looked so funny,"" you'll say. I almost thought about asking for a refund, and not only that, but also my hour and a half back, and my lost brain cells. I will explain the reasons this film is a literal piece of garbage, and should be buried thousands of feet beneath the earth where it will rot away, never to be seen again. The trailer promises hilarious spoofs of films ranging from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", to ""X-Men"", to ""Narnia"". I tell you this; the only funny scenes in this film are in the trailer. So watch the trailer a couple of times and you've seen the movie. Every other scene is boring, retarded, unfunny, and horribly made. How the studio actually ended up OK-ing ""Epic Movie"" is beyond me. The acting is dreadful, granted it is a spoof, but even spoofs need semi-good actors. The continuity is non-existent; the stunt people will play the characters in a fight scene on full on display for the camera. I think the directors thought it would be funny to show bad continuity, and it isn't in the least. I'll wager that the writers all got drunk and said, ""Ok, everyone say something funny."" ""Let's have Captain Jack dance!"" ""Great! Let's go film the movie dudes!"" Anyone could make a movie like this, absolutely anyone. What's funny in their stupid mind isn't funny to the smart, movie going public. I should've expected this since they are the same guys who made the horribly unsuccessful ""Date Movie"". In fact, it is apparently so bad it made IMDb's 100 worst films of all time list. ""Epic Movie"" will undoubtedly make it as well. It is the worst film of the year, and next year, and probably the year after.So save yourself and your brain cells and don't see this sad excuse for a film.

He then died of cardiac arrest, an exit to the misery that was Epic Movie. There is not ONE funny moment in this entire movie. The fact that it is labeled a comedy is not only an insult to comedy, but an insult to us all. 5 year olds see this movie and become scarred for life. 50 year olds see this and want to end their life. Do not, if you have any faith or love of the world left, see Epic Movie. If George Bush were to do ONE thing right in the rest of his lame duck Presidency, he would do a house-to-house round up of all copies of Epic Movie (should be easy, as nobody would EVER buy this), and bury them in the desert next to ET, the game. We would then pulverize them hundreds of times, burn them, and then seal the ashes in concrete. These ashes would be further destroyed by nuking them in the middle of the ocean.

I have no idea what happened here (I can make some guesses - but I suspect it wouldn't be posted for fear of slander). What I don't understand is how this thing could of ever been made. The problem with the film is that is a poorly organized collection of attempts at spoofing hit films using comedic elements that are mostly puerile and sophomoric (basically it looks like it was written by people with the comic sense of a elementary school kid). I mean, there is a take off on Willy Wonka where the guy starts eating chocolate from a river and cannot stop, and is then told it is a sewage line.The film is extremely muddled and disorganized. It's really hard to describe. It is almost unwatchable.Yeah, there were a couple of high points - seeing Fred Willard again was one, and the part where the Fred Willard character was Kung Fu fighting using an obviously Asian double was actually good - but that was it. Some of the beginning was good - the Davinci code knockoff was OK. But that was it. And, for no apparent reason, there are a couple of unclad females - nice to look at but irrelevant.If you want to see good movie spoofs - watch ""Airplane"", ""Hot Shots"", the vastly under-rated ""Top Secret!"" and ""Spaceballs"" - these movies succeed without resorting to excessive stupid humor and do not require that the watcher have intimate knowledge of the movies they're spoofing.

Epic Movie and Scary Movie poke fun at blockbuster movies from the past year or so and feature dumb (and not likable) characters. At least the Scary Movie series had a good amount of clever humor doses in it, because Epic Movie had next to nothing funny about it. I went into auditorium #9 (one of the largest at my theatre; also a complete mess to signal the target audience of Epic Movie) with high hopes. I left feeling dumber than the two of the six writers of Scary Movie series who directed this masterpiece. Then again, I can only blame myself, as the trailers looked dreadful and it was by only 1/3 of the Scary Movie team (probably the ones who took a massive pay-cut).There are a few funny moments in Epic Movie: Borat appearing in the end was funny, as he says in broken English, ""Yes a-man,"" or whatever that funny thing he says in Borat is. Seeing him in the green thong was disturbing, but funny. Jack Sparrow (hilariously titled Jack Swallows here- please notice the sarcasm) makes an appearance, providing some funny scenes; at least the directors knew that the best part of Pirate's of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest was the wheel fighting scene, and they took advantage of that by including it in Epic Movie.Now for the rest of the filmouch. Directors Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer and their team of crack heads try so hard to be funny, but the only people who should be laughing are little kids and people who are smart enough to avoid watching this movie. Barf and snot aren't funny; they are repulsive and immature beyond words. Maybe if a bored, perverted little kid directed this movie it wouldn't be so bad. But the directors here were grown men. Some examples of the genius-level humor used in Epic Movie is as follows the White Witch is now the White B!tch. A man who sucks at life grows small chicken wings on his back and makes pathetic, whining noises.

That said, some gags like those relating to harry Potter and Wonka's factory, are spot on.Another problem with the film is the ending. Ideally, as the main characters exit Gnarnia back to the interior of Willy's factory, it would have been funnier if we'd encountered Willy once gain, with some gag related to Gnarnia. But, it was not to be.Yes, I laughed, but a repeat viewing would probably be very flat.",Epic Movie

Scary Movie is the only films that are funny, the hell with Date Movie and Epic Movie, seriously this was one of the worst comedies i've ever seen. I can't believe those who voted 10 on it, probably some 12 year old kid. The jokes were bad and it felt like there was no point about this movie, they just wanted to do a parody on new films, i mean who the hell does a parody on ""Borat"" ?!. And the plot is the worst i've ever seen, the guy who wrote it is missing brains, he made sure that everything should fit in with the parodies, such as ""Narnia"" ""Da Vinci Code"" etc, no offense but this couldn't been done any WORSE. A weak 4/10 from me! There is nothing less to say than: The worst movie-movie ever!",Epic Movie
145,Subzero7,Don't bother,1,20 February 2007,"This is literally one of the worst movies I have every seen. It's the first movie at least 10 years or more that I actually walked out half way through it. I usually stay to the end because I keep hoping that something will happen to make it worth it, but this time, I just couldn't do it.The acting was horrible. It looks as if the script was written by the writers by simply going on a drinking binge then eating a lot and then throwing up, looking at the random chunks, and then trying to visualize letters that formed words, and then writing those imagined words down as the script. Then what you see on the screen, is the end result.I love spoof movies. Naked Gun series was excellent. The Scary Movie series was pretty good as well. Scary Movie 1 was excellent; number 2 was good, 3 had a few good moments but wasn't that great, and 4 was about as good as number 2.I do love a good spoof movie and had hight hopes for this movie. The trailer made it look great (as they are supposed to do) but in the end, it was simply worthless. I can't even believe it got the green light to be made. Another disappointment is that they had some good actors for what they were doing and they still couldn't pull it off. Jennifer Coolidge, the White Bitch, was great for that role. She is good in these types of roles but it didn't help. Really, she is the ONLY one that was any good in any of the roles.If you haven't seen this movie yet, DON'T GO!!! Don't even rent it on video, it's not even worth that. I know there are a few people that have given this a rating of 10. I would say that they were either joking, being sarcastic, or slept through the whole thing and didn't want to admit it.Simply put, don't bother!!!!",Epic Movie

The musical numbers are colorful and good take-offs of the stuff they're mocking.There are 100 talented actors doing bits and cameos and this montage is a career- starter for many of them, deservedly so.

It focuses around the Chronicles or Narnia and then parodies an unbelievable amount of films such as Xmen, Yo MTV Cribs, Pirates of the Caribbean, Davinci Code, Superman, Punked. They have also added spoofs of celebrities such as Paris Hilton, Kanye West, Flavor Flav, etc. This movie does not work on any level. It is truly not funny. The character of Harry Beaver was not funny. The Slapstick was forced and not that funny, I did not laugh, smile, snicker etc once during viewing this film. It may rank with Date Movie and Freddie got Fingered as one of the worst theatrical releases ever. Kal Penn and Fred Willard are better than this movie.

The plot line was stupid making parodies at box office smashes such as 'Harry Potter' 'Narnia' and 'Willie Wonka and the chocolate factory' and it is not a patch on other parody films like any of the 'scary movies' or 'shaun of the dead.'I walked into the cinema thinking it would be quite a good laugh but 20 minutes in i was ready to walk out - but my 11 year old sister wouldn't let me. I also felt there was a lot of wasted talent in the film. Jennifer Coolidge is a brilliant comic actress but her performance in Epic Movie was cringeingly bad.

I actually got a headache watching this piece of crap. It makes PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE look like POLTERGEIST, JAWS, PSYCHO and THE SHINING'S greatness combined.None of that hasn't bee said before.

Its a surreal - almost Jungian - moment- and one of the most unforgettable scenes in film history.If you have a problem with beautiful female nudity- then this particular moment will be totally lost on you.The rest of the film- is home video quality though.

I wont tell you what they are for I hate doing spoilers, but there are a few jokes in there that work and that can make you laugh. PG-13 just doesn't work with these type of spoof and reference movies.

Sorry, I think pop culture spoofing of other movies are generally good when its actually done with someone who actually has talent in writing funny things. That was simply a stupid filler movie with bits for 2007. With very few bits that were funny enough to smirk.

These two are the equivalents of Ewe Boll when it comes to 'comedy' film making. I'd put spoiler alert on here, but there's nothing to spoil. I won't even go into the plot, I'll just say: Avoid Epic Movie.Other than the god awful script (I mean, just awful rehash of a bunch of movies thrown together), the less than great acting and the poorly executed timing..........well, okay, this movie's got nothing. I laughed, nay, chuckled once at something that wasn't actually funny, but it hit me enough to elicit a small chuckle. I can't even remember what the bit was, but it wouldn't make SNL these days, and we all know how bad that's been the last decade. Now, I'm of the school that Date Movie was one of the worst films I've ever seen. I still stand by that assessment and this one is actually better than that one. But, by better I mean bottom 20 and and not bottom 10 of all time. If there's something good to be taken from this it's this: if you're a young filmmaker (or going to school to be one), this gives you hope that you can get something green lighted by someone somewhere. If these two guys (who might be the worst comedy writing team since the dawn of man) can sucker people into green lighting two of the worst scripts the world has ever seen, than anyone can get their idea made into a feature length movie, even if it's near Ed Wood quality. Some thoughts on the actors: I do admit that the Mays chick is kinda cute-ish, but I'm partial to redheads. She's not fantastic in any sense, just cute-ish. Meanwhile, Kal Penn is losing his humorous touch, I think. Between this and the apparently awful Van Wilder 2 (I was spared that one, thank you Satan), I think he's just about finished, which is almost too bad, but then, how far can you go being a one trick pony? And the Campbell guy........I really just haven't gotten his appeal as an actor. He's goofy looking, he has very odd facial expressions and isn't much with the comic timing, so it's not hard to see how he's been in two of the worst 'comedies' of the last 2 years. Oh, and Carmen Electra does her usual slow-motion body rub that would win some AVN awards but will never do her any good in the mainstream acting world. Can't go without that, right?If that's a spoiler, than standards are too low. See it if you must, but trust a man when he implores you that this is one of the worst movies he's ever seen.

That's the biggest joke of this entire thing and, like the rest of the ""jokes"" in this movie, there's nothing funny about it.Epic Movie is an example of how Hollywood is just a corporate machine with no interest in producing artistic, though provoking, progressive movies anymore. The idea for this movie was clearly concocted in a marketing meeting with a bunch of fat execs who sat down one day with their big Starbucks coffees and Dunkin Doughnuts and came up with a movie idea that would hit all of their target markets, whilst ripping off any movie that has made money over the last yearYeah, Scary Movie did it, but at least it was funny, and was poking fun back at Hollywood by showing that movies designed by marketers were the real joke. I guess the marketing people didn't get that joke either.I mean what is going on in this world? Who read this script and thought it was a good idea? How did this movie ever get made?

No, I won't even say 'parody', more, references ENTIRE scenes to recreating these comedies, of course emptying these scenes of any of the far funnier jokes that were in the original. How clever of them to basically rip off (NOT parody) comedies far superior to the movie itself and derive it of any of the redeeming qualities. It's just so logical too! I'm not going to review this any longer, if you can't get the picture that this is a crap movie from the dire review on IMDb or indeed any review from someone with half a brain cell, then I suggest you do this, push someone over so they fall and shout tedious derogatory words and you might get an idea of the various horrific punchlines used to substitute for the lack of clever scriptwriters.If you can't comprehend these warnings then I'm sorry to say, you're incredibly low in intelligence and probably need to see a doctor.

Sure, they made me laugh at least once, but only once in an hour and twenty minute movie, that was supposed to be a comedy, not an idiot movie. The same jokes were lapped over and over and over again, until I almost fell asleep. During the first five minutes, I could tell that this movie was going to fail. I even saw twelve people leave.

169,Rick_Terminal,Should have been good... but it's so awful it's plain embarrassing,1,11 February 2007,"Where do I start with this film? (Slight Spoilers).First off, there were three moments in this film when I smirked gently, and reluctantly. The first being when 3 Hogwarts teachers were killed, the second when the four main characters woke up abandoned, and doing a typical heroic charge were all slaughtered with in seconds. The third was the Superman parody. I did say 'smirked gently'.I've got to say that I'm amazed that at the time of writing, there are 602 ""10 star"" ratings. Nobody in their right mind would award this a 10. I found it an insult to my backside that I sat through this drivel  but mercifully the filmmakers didn't have enough material to make a normal length movie. This is very shot at 68 minutes, and frankly, that is something of a blessing.Okay, I'll try and justify why I'm so against this movie in a series of points. Hopefully some people will listen and save themselves the price of a cinema ticket. I'll cap this at ten points to keep this post short(ish).1. Every joke falls flat. Every single one. 2. The quality of writing is appalling. People urinating or being sick just isn't funny. Especially not when it's done as badly as this. 3. You genuinely despise the writers by the end of the film  to the extent where you are loathe to even smile. Jokes about large breasted woman are especially unfunny when you realise that they use them because they didn't have any material to fill the gaps. 4. Oh look. Gay jokes. A gay beaver and part dear/part human joke should be funny  but it just isn't. 5. The acting is depressingly bad. I genuinely felt embarrassed watching these people make fools of themselves like this. Comedic acting is an art form which is hard to get right, but here there is no comic timing, line delivery or posture. It's just a bunch of people dithering from disjointed scene to disjointed scene. 6. The music is diabolical and irritating. I don't get hip-hop anyway, but putting in several hip-hop tracks to fill in time like this is plain insulting. 7. All the ""funniest"" parts of this movie are in the trailer. 8. Even the choice of movies that is parodies is unimaginative. 9. This movie tries to offend everybody, but it's done so badly that it is like an irritating drunk prat mouthing off in a chat room. 10. The public deserve more intellectual respect than this film offers. Seriously, this movie treats you like a moronic simpleton. We can handle clever jokes - maybe these guys just couldn't write them.I've got to put this to the people voting this a ten. Why? What possible justification is there for this sexist, unfunny, badly written cash-cow crap to get a ten?So... Just don't subject yourself to this. These b@stards have already made a fortune, and they don't deserve to make a penny more. I hope that those involved in the high-level decisions have ruined their careers, I really do. I hope they sack the two writers responsible, and force the remaining 4 ""Scary Movie"" to sit down and write something that is genuinely funny for a change.If you feel that you want to argue with me about this, you either have not seen the film, or more probably are scoring lower IQ results than the bedding you sleep on.

Not only is it unfunny, but they do a lot of references in the movie. I like subtle references, but Epic Movie is not subtle with it at all. There's one part in the movie where Harry Beaver tells them, ""I'll meet you at Aslows. May the force be with you."" How on earth is that funny? Epic Movie does a lot of obvious references attempting to be funny. It doesn't work. There's also a lot of pointless montages, like when Mr. Thomnas shows his house on Cribs, or when Willy Wonka tortures the kids, making candy out of them. (I'm not making this up.)

Not helping either are the two female leads who I've never heard of and probably won't remember. ""Date Movie"" was far much worse, starting with opening credits of a fat chick dancing to a lame song. At least there were no opening credits to have the audience sit in agony.

Which wasn't funny. The saga ended in 2003 and we see this film in 2006. Don't these film-makers have any sense of cultural relevance?

Remove fat jokes because they aren't funny, avoid cheesy celebrity impressions from semi look-alikes. Put in some more flashy special effects and not ones stolen from other films. Negotiate a few big stars to be in the lead. Minimize dance and rap moves. They only work in concerts. And above all, try screening your films to tests audiences. That way you know what works and what doesn't. Nows your chance to emulate the Wayans brothers since they've recently made bad films. I suggest you take that rare opportunity. And I hope you the viewers and the film-makers will find this information useful.",Epic Movie

I didn't know a comedy could fail on almost every level until I saw this movie. Honestly, it's the equivalent of watching little school children repeat silly fart jokes they've just heard; only you're watching it on the big screen.I've tried to like this film and see past its countless faults, but it's so bad it's impossible to even be a guilty pleasure. Even if the plot was even slightly comprehensible, the actors don't seem to know what they're doing, or where they are, or even why they've allowed themselves to appear in such shameful trash.There is no humour in Epic Movie; the ""2 out of 6 writers from Scary Movie"" just rely on mind-blowingly stupid, pathetic parodies to ""entertain us"", which are nothing like the parodies in the Scary Movie franchise. Those were actually funny. It's like they've taken the most extremely straight-forward, obvious aspects from well-known movies, added an unprecedented level of stupid childish homophobic potty humour and tried to make us laugh by showing the characters from Narnia, The Davinci Code and Charlie and the Chocolate Factor dancing to hip-hop music.When you can't even successfully parody something that actually deserved to be made, THAT's when you have a problem.3/10.

They say it's stupid, plot less, and filled with cult-references.To be completely honest, they're right. But if you come into this movie expecting any less than what you saw in the Scary Movies, then of course you'll be upset. This movie isn't made to go down as a classic. It's made to keep teenagers entertained.And, trust me, it does.Parodying every intense summer movie (from X-Men to Narnia, Pirates of the Caribbean to Da Vinci Code), Epic Movie delivers hilarious lines, entertaining slap-humor, and makes even the most action-packed films of the summer look simply ridiculous. The acting isn't top-notch and the special effects aren't special...but that's simply what makes the movie funnier. People will surely laugh when they see a Japanese stunt double in clear view and a stunt manikin collapse to the ground.If nothing else, this movie is a fantastic and hilarious Friday night out.

Oh dear, there is a difference between spoofing a movie and blatantly ripping it off. If you think the way to spoof ""Snakes on a Plane"" is to have a plane with snakes on it, then this is pretty much the level of originality to expect here. ""Nacho Libre"" - hey, a Mexican Jack-Black clone wrester in an identical costume... with nachos! Woo! No-body will ever think of that gag, right viewers? And we're only a few minutes in to the movie!!!It's as if the directors just decided to re-film sequences of other movies and throw the odd knob or fart joke in. The movie is less than an hour and a half. One feels sure the script took less time to write. Honestly, the whole film crew should be rounded up humanely gassed after producing this pile of celluloid nausea, and every print should be burnt. The makers of the original movies should sue 7 shades of the proverbial out of this to ensure it never happens again. Try watching paint dry, it's more entertaining.",Epic Movie

But aside of the albino monk's stupid comments, some of it was quite funny. A lot of folks who don't like it are upset that their favorite movies got the job in here, and while it could have been better, it was heads above Date Movie, which didn't make me laugh at all.

I did kinda look funny in the trailer but again at the time I had no idea how bad this would turn out and the worst part about this is they made even more of these godawful parodies and I even made the same mistake again and even saw Meet The Spartans. While that film was slightly better, it was still pretty damn awful. If I had a time machine I'd travel back to 2007 and warn my 18 year old self not to see this movie and that it is awful and downright unfunny and that he could spend his $5 elsewhere, maybe on some fast food meal, anything than this godawful film. A word of warning, don't buy this, rent it, watch it on Netfilx, or even YouTube for that matter. It is not worth your time, in fact rent Norbit or Jack & Jill instead. Yeah both films are still pretty awful, but they are watchable compared to this piece of crap film.

I can't believe they found enough people to dedicate time to make the movie or even people to fund it. The only way this movie could have been worse is if it included Carrot Top, Paulie Shore, and Ben Affleck in the staring roles, but then I think I would of had to lobotomize myself to forget the horror my eyes would had endured.

It definitely wasn't as bad as Date Movie. I found it to be funny. The characters were likable. Also the acting was good. The plot was very simple, but then so was Narnia, the main movie it was spoofing. It also spoofs Willy Wonka & Pirates of the Caribbean to a lesser extent.

It was as if they just collected a bunch of skits made by some drunk frat boys and put them into a movie.... there was no plot, or rhyme or reason to the madness. Fact is we had to turn the movie off because it was just so horrible we could not watch...... that has not happened since White Chicks which we left the theater on during the first 20 minutes.....

But this movie seems to have something special that few movies can boast: very low quality. The original concept of the lampooning of real epic movies is a good concept, and the potential satire in this type of project is, or should be, a gold mine. Historically, these types of movies have been reasonably successful, and most of them rate at least a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. But the uniqueness of this effort allows it a rating that only few producers can have nightmares about.Some of the adolescent, and pre-adolescent audiences may find this story, and all of it's gags, to be funny. But not enough to make it successful. For most adults, however, this film probably misses the mark by a mile. With all of the gags being hinged together so loosely, and with no credibility or sensibility attached to pull them off, one can only hope the movie ends as soon as possible. In comparison, the first few installments of Scary Movie were funny, proving that the concept and format has a chance. But unless you have about an 8 year old mentality, and then are willing to let anything pass for entertainment, you may think twice about paying to see it.

The stupidest jokes are inside Epic Movie. The writers have maxed out everything from the gay faun and beaver to kicking people out of a window and even to that guy from the DaVinci Code spoof who spoke Latin but didn't really ""speak"" Latin.

The writers have to think of fresher ideas.Another thing that bothered me was the amount of recycled actors that had previously appeared in Date Movie. Could we get someone new? The shortness of the movie was also a problem. It's a little more than an hour long, and most of the scenes are filler material. The filler material also got me really upset. The film maker has to justify putting in a bunch of half clothed women just to make the audience pay attention.

But the audience has already seen them if they've seen the trailers.It seems to me that the production companies when they come up with this level of bad movie--better than DATE MOVIE, not as good as the lame SCARY MOVIE 4--it's a matter these days of coming up with an ad campaign to get as many people into the theater the first weekend, and hope to hell you recoup as much of your money as possible.

THIS, is not even a movie. It is a string of scenes pasted together, constantly going from one movie to the next, and TRYING to make it funny. It's not even trying to tell a story, it's just spoof for spoof's sake. I'm only fifteen minutes into it, and I think they've already tried to spoof seven or eight different movies. They try WAY TOO HARD, rather than make the spoofing more subtle, like it was meant to be. It's like they are trying to ram it down your throat and say ""look, it's a spoof movie so that means its automatically funny. Don't worry about a plot or even a cohesive flow to the scenes!!""

I did not laugh once while watching this movie. They say jokes that we have all heard before. It's probably the worst movie in the 'Parody' genre and I don't say this very often however it is probably one of the worst movies ever. It's an Epic Failure for Jason Friedberg. I don't think I watched the ending because I was so bored. It is a stupid movie with people who cannot act to save their lives.

The plot is ridiculously boring and there aren't even jokes. To me it seems like the writers did not even try to be funny here.The movie begins with a parody of Willy Wonka, which sets the tone for the entire movie of badness. From there on, the movie consists of a bunch of people getting hit in the face over and over and over again. Most of the movie parodies The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe with stabs at The Da Vinci Code, Nacho Libre, Harry Potter, Click and some others. None of which are really that funny (There is a funny line about Harold and Kumar go to White Castle and that is probably the only funny ""joke"" in this movie.) The whole thing is rather pathetic on all ends. Even most of the cinematography was awful.Please do not go see this movie, because it just encourages them to make more.

He approaches the ridiculous with a knowing level of sarcasm. He's like, ''It sucks to be in a stupid spoof and I'm going to point it out.'' Mays (TV's Heroes) plays Lucy as if Forrest Gump were playing mentally challenged. There's no payoff to her ditziness. Campbell (Date Movie) plays Peter like a prancing, preening wuss. Nobody ever taught him that spoof characters have to play it straight. And Chambers (White Chicks) plays Susan with no personality whatsoever. She's not even the generically sassy black chick. Spoof veteran Carmen Electra is almost unrecognizable as Mystique, another hot chick in blue, while the Johnny Depp clones are expertly cast, especially Hammond as the effeminate Jack Swallows (Get it?). Glover as the effeminate Willy is also scary.

This movie has a plot at the very beginning and even gets a few laughs out of people, but ten minutes in the plot starts to fade and become too complicated and the jokes are used so many times that they're not funny anymore. How many times can you laugh at Lucy saying exactly what Susan said, or Peter drawing stick figures by peeing in the snow. I think after seeing this I think that its finally time to stop with the spoof movies. they were funny at first and everyone loved them but there's not a lot of movies that are stupid, scary, or funny enough to scare.

This movie held a clinic on bad jokes. It was like they went to a random middle school and had students fill out jokes for them, then they proceeded to make a script around that. Then they have jokes from movies that aren't epic at all. Nacho Libre was OK but it surely wasn't epic. They put movies in it for he hell of it. Did they really need Paris Hilton jokes. And if you do have Paris Hilton in the movie and try to make fun of her, don't put a candy bar in her purse. I think that this movie, if haven't already guessed it, really sucked. Arguably one of the worst movies of the decade if not of all time that i have seen. I truly believe that if they cut the screen in two, put the movie on the one side of the screen, and a piece of dry donkey terd on the other, people would watch the donkey terd trickle down the screen with more entertain than what this movie had to offer.

What caused me to go see it sooner was a thread in the IMDb discussion forums which pretty much accused the film of being an attack on Christianity.Well that settled it. I HAD to go see it because I work for a Christian ministry that is forever fielding calls from worried parents, afraid of the effects the media might have on their children.Admittedly Epic Movie primarily spoofs The Lion The Witch And The Wardrobe, a story that has a strong Christian parallel; but I don't see it an attack on our faith, simply because very few non-Christians are aware of that parallel. If anyone takes exception to the Also character (and he WAS pretty objectionable) I don't think the writers intended it as a blatant attempt to offend us.Taken on its own merits, don't go see the film if you want some intellectual stimulation. It is in the same genre as the Scary Movie series so if you liked them then you will probably like this. If you didn't then go see something else.

It is a sweltering turd, and you absolutely should not watch it. Now, it is worth point out that I am a giant fan of kitsch and camp, and love gems like ""Troll 2"" and ""Freddy Got Fingered"". Sometimes, if a movie can stretch itself too being ridiculously absurd, it can actually manage to develop its own sense of charm. This simply is not the case with Epic Movie.And honestly, I expected it to be a bit more likable as camp. After all, cult favorites David Carradine and Crispin Glover appear in it. However, their appearances are little more than cameos, and neither are given an opportunity to camp things up appropriately.So what makes this movie fail so detrimentally? For one, the writers spend too much time explaining their jokes. They should take notes from the Coen brothers on this one. They obviously feel the audience is completely retarded. But since this movie has an IMDb overall rating of 2, they apparently misjudged the audience. Second off, it would help if the jokes were funny. The typical joke for this movie is making a pop culture movie reference (may or may not be from an actual epic movie), point out where the reference came from, and turn it into a fart joke. I honestly laughed at no more than two of their jokes, and those laughs were more light chuckles. There simply isn't any sense of invention here.It is clear there isn't any intent to make quality cinema here. I mean, there is NO intention of any kind. I'm not sure what the business model is, maybe they are making this on a low budget and getting a lot of sponsorship money and then making enough on ticket sales to come out in the green over all? I don't know, but the mind certainly boggles that these guys are able to continue making films. It is really surprising they are not getting financed the same way Uwe Boll does in Germany. However, the bottom line is: avoid this. Even if you think it might be funny to watch as a bad movie to make fun of MST3K style, don't do it. Because this isn't even unintentionally funny.

There's enough negativity out there from the flamers, the trolls, people who like to spew venom and hide behind their cybernetic anonymity. Besides, why should we listen to the opinions of others, going into something lacking an open mind, just following sheepishly on advance word or The Buzz, or the words of some mealy-mouthed critic who was probably a failed filmmaker-novelist-musician taking it out on others who at least have made an attempt at something? Give everyone a fair chance, man! Does this mean that Epic Movie defied the critics and turned out to be a good movie? NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Are you kidding? It was dross! But no, I am determined not to add to the general negative karma that's floating on the electronic ether. Stay positive, stay positive. Thankfully I didn't spend any money on this, just lost a bet and had it given to me to watch, before passing it onto my 12-year-old niece, whose friends had watched it and liked it. Upon viewing it herself, she liked it too, though she's astute enough to be equally embarrassed at liking it. And having seen it as well, it was initially successful at the box office, and was trimmed on general release to get a wider audience, as only 12 year olds would appreciate it. 12 year olds who undergo involuntary spasms of laughter when they hear swear words and sub-Carry On puns (""Harry Beaver"", anyone?), and generally have sufficient attention deficit to half-watch it while ruminating over whether or not Johnny Depp is hotter than Orlando Bloom. (He is, by the way. I'm straight, and even I know he's hotter than most main sequence suns in our galaxy.) Epic Movie has been made by the same people who did Date Movie, and to judge from the titles, presumably also Not Another Teen Movie and the Scary Movie series. Or maybe they all attended the same grade-school classes where all their best jokes were written. I think I saw Scary Movie once, so I'm certain I've seen them all: some semi-talented and talented people embarrass themselves to varying degrees while spoofing other films in amazingly limp and uncreative fashions. No, spoofing's too strong a word; that implies even a measure of wit involved- No, wait! I'm starting to contradict my earlier Mission Statement on promoting positivity. take a deep breath, start again The plot is a Frankenstein monster of, you guessed it, epic movies like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Da Vinci Code and The X-Men, with minor organs in the beast garnered from less epic fare such as Borat, Nacho Libre, and Snakes on a Plane. Again, I can't use the word ""spoof"" here, because there's almost no attempt at any wit or satire with these. And no, I don't count showing Magneto with a giant Warner Brothers cartoon-style magnet on his head, or calling the Narnia villainess the White B*tch instead of Witch, or having Willy Wonka as a cannibalistic maniac. Mel Brooks at his worst remains superior to what's offered here, because he at least can recreate the target scenes and provide jokes, however lame. Yes, I have just stated that there are worse films than Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and I'm sticking by that claim with Galilean tenacity. What makes it more tragic than deplorable is that there seems to be a genuine, professional attempt to make a decent film (some scenes demonstrate at least an aptitude at creativity) as well as rich, faithful recreations of many of the various elements of the original films. Of special note is Crispin Glover's uncanny impression of Depp's Wonka, and SNL's Darrell Hammond's equally laudable copy of Depp's Jack Sparrow. But giving nothing but accurate recreations is no more funny than that class clown who thought it was amusement in itself to mimic everyone's voices around him. It's as if the screenwriters abandoned the notion of providing humor in favor of letting the audience play Reference Bingo and go, ""Oh yeah, they took that bit from The Fast and The Furious!"" But not totally; there are brief moments that made me chuckle, maybe even laugh if I'd had another beer in me. But it becomes embarrassing, like watching a drunken friend humiliate himself by trying to walk a straight line in an effort to prove his sobriety when everyone knows he can barely manage a few steps. And when they weren't mostly failing to be funny, they had their characters break into hip-hop gyrations. The first time, seeing Oompa Loompas do it, is almost funny. Seeing pirates do it, then mythical warriors, then mutants following, and this tenuous bungee cord of a gag is ready to snap The four leads are forgettable, as they're meant to be, and I expect nothing less- no! Stop that, it's mean! It's not as if the better, more talented performers who appear could do much better with what they were given: Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, Glover and Hammond have appeared in some of the funniest films around, and I'm confident enough in their abilities that they'll survive this. There you go: the scenery looked nice, I almost laughed out loud, and I liked some of the performers to wish them better roles than what they had here. See? That was positive enough, wasn't it? Take that, Samuel Johnson!",Epic Movie
237,after-hour_dvd_collector,Wow. Just ... wow. Someone actually dared to make this movie.,6,12 May 2007,"... and me and two friends went to see it. Double feature, right after Spiderman 3. Having been warned by other friends (well, one, at least), and the low rating here. End result? Well, i've learned that nothing beats seeing a movie in person. Was it gross? Definitely. Was it stupid? Of course. Subtlety of a steam-hammer? Check. Effects on the cheap side? Yes. Trampling all over cherished highlights of great movie making? Right-o. Overuse of bodily functions? Check. Hitting below the belt? - Belt? Which belt?And it was some 90 minutes of the most immature fun i've had in years, mostly because this movie DARED to do all this. I've not seen something that high on the absurdity scale for a long, long time. Mind you, despite its total lack of dignity and/or cinematic integrity, glaring disregard for continuity etc., you need to have A LOT of references at hand at any given moment of the film. MTV, Chocolate factory, M:I, X-Men, DaVinci code, Pirates of the Caribbean, Narnia, Potter, cheap kung-fu movies ... all thrown into the blender, highest setting. Whoever wrote this, they've spent a lot of time inside a cinema over the last years.The storyline? Who you're kidding? If at all, i'd guess it had a design guideline, which maybe read something like that: ""Didn't you hate that annoying talking beaver from Narnia? And that wheel thing from Pirates of the Caribbean! Didn't you wonder how all those Narnia hybrid creatures came to be? And don't get me started about that creepy Willy Wonka! Well, LET'S SHOW THEM how much we hated that! Hey, call that Star Wars fan group you mentioned, ask them if they want to be on screen ..."" etc. etc.Would i recommend it? No way. Then again, the exceptionally bad reputation made me curious, Plan-9-curious. Not expecting anything, i went away amused. It may not be for everyone. You wouldn't want to show it to your parents. Or your kids, either. It may not even work for a second viewing. But, it worked for me, on that one day today, at that one viewing. And for a movie, that's good enough for me.",Epic Movie

But believe me, anyone who saw those film should get a medal, because to stand the whole picture, for 1 hour 33 minutes, you gotta have guts.

The jokes were lacking in any originality, and mostly relied on sight comedy that doesn't have anything to it except the absurd and rancid. I'm all for sick twisted humor, but this is just childish. Especially because it parodies only movies from 2006. No classics or anything, just movies that are recognizable by today's younger generation, so they'll probably will have seen it and find it funny.

Edward (Kal Penn) who has just been thrown out of the monastery, where he's lived all his life, after insulting the cooking skills of the monks. Susan (Faun Chambers)who, on her way to Namibia to meet her adopted parents (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie), get's thrown out of a plane.

In the factory Lucy finds a magic wardrobe that leads to an enchanted fantasy land called ""Gnarnia"" (for legal purposes), and so the ""epic"" adventure begins.Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are two lazy writers who must have seen many Zucker movies but never bothered to stop and think about what it is that make people like these movies or what actually makes them funny. Their formula for humor seem to be that bad special effects, obvious stunt doubles, randomly thrown in hip-hop/musical numbers, low brow potty humor and movie references are by themselves always hilarious no matter what the circumstances are. A few jokes made me chuckle but it's not enough to save this train wreck. It would had been better if they had settled on a main theme like ""fantasy"" and limited it to: The Chronicles of Narnia, Harry potter and the Lord of the rings movies. That, plus a story that is not dependent on the Friedberg and Seltzer formula of ""humor"".This is a very bad movie.

When I saw that Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard were in it, I was eagerly anticipating another brilliant comedy along the lines of Best in Show, or Waiting for Guffman. Jennifer, Fred - WHY did you do this? I won't elaborate on what everyone else has said about this garbage, except I must wonder: WHO was it made for? Not children, considering how many unfunny, vulgar potty jokes and sleezy sexual gags are in it. It couldn't be made for adults, since any reasonable adult would turn it off in disgust after 10 minutes. I'm not easily offended and usually really like spoofs and silly, juvenile humour. I laughed my fool head off at Naked Gun, Airplane, Dumb & Dumber, Hot Shots! and others in that vein, but the difference is that they're FUNNY.I thought I had seen the worst movie ever when I watched the Wicker Man last week. Wrong! Epic Movie hits lows never before seen. In comparison, The Wicker Man is Oscar worthy, and it was a million times funnier.If badly done, crude gags about pustule popping, testicle smashing, vomit and poo/pee make you laugh, this is the movie for you. If not, don't see it, not even for free. Whatever you do, do not pay to see this or you'll want cut your throat afterward.

I'm sure there are lots of people who will have the time of their life watching this movie, but I'm not one of them. During the 80 minutes this film lasted, I laughed twice. So here they are (you could consider them spoilers): The first time was during the faun version of Scarface. A faun said ""I'm Tony Fauntana!"" and a smile appeared on my face. The second laugh was at the ""White Castle"" remark. If you didn't see ""Harold & Kumar go to White Castle"", you won't get it. And then there was the tachometer that went to 11.

Not a good thing.The movie made fun of various pop culture ideas, Paris Hilton, Borat, Snakes on a Plane, Sudoku, Dead Mans Chest, and many others. Tell me what part of Borat, and Snakes on a Plane warrants a satirical view? They are already satire! The humor was very stale too, they took the jokes already said in other stupid humor movies and said them again. It's like watching Airplane, then Airplane II the Sequel, all the same jokes repeated.This movies humor was so stale, that the few one-liners I thought were amusing, were only amusing because of how UN-amusing the rest of the jokes are. The simple placement of ""Chuck Norris Rocks"" now that I think of it is no longer funny. A year ago yes, but not anymore. I chuckled though because I was desperately searching for something to laugh at.The jokes in the movie were not at all creative, most stupid humor movies; their jokes are actually creative. Not epic movie however, for example, they switched up the most obvious things. Changing Willy Wonka's chocolate river with a sewage line, Changing The White Witch in Narnia to ""The Wight Bitch.""

I've seen a few films of this genre (the scary movies etc) and found them to be OK, quite entertaining and humorous in parts, but this film has no redeeming features whatsoever. I honestly didn't laugh once. If you find this film funny, you are either a moron or in serious need of a humour transplant. It's obviously just a cash in and no thought has gone into it whatsoever. It appeals to the lowest common denominator and the jokes are so bad and so ill thought out, they are cringe-worthy (chocolate river is actually a river of excrement - a bit like this film - hysterical. Man gets bitten on the crotch by a snake  genius). It makes me cringe to actually think that I actually sat through this mess. The best thing about the film is the running time, about 80 minutes (even though it feels like a lifetime).I know the film is 12A but that is no excuse for a lack of plot or humour.

We chose to see Epic Movie, because we were in the mood to laugh.The frustrating thing about this movie is that it *could* have been made to be really funny. What a waste for Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, and others! The makers of this movie assumed we are idiots who needto be pounded over the head with the same jokes over and over again. I wanted to walk out, and now really wish I had.All the way home, my husband apologized for taking me to that movie. I told him that we mutually agreed to go to this movie, and he didn't need to apologize, unless I apologized to him, too.Normally, I don't read too many reviews before seeing a movie.

One problem with the movie is there is never and good jokes or very funny parts. I laughed a couple times but not very hard. I liked the way they made fun of special effects and made them as cheesy as possible. I also thought they meshed all the movies together very well, they just needed to make it a bit funnier. Adam Cambell apparently hasn't learned his lesson. He was in ""Date Movie"" another spoof movie that didn't do well at all. I don't see why he came back to do another one. But what I don't get is how you can hate it. It wasn't so bad that I would vote a 1 out of 10 stars, and everyone that was in the theater would agree with me.

My instincts warned me that the experience would not be nice and boy were they right! Every scene feels rushed. So rushed that the makers of this movie did not even bother to conceal equipment used (like dummies to replace untalented actors) in the film. The average viewer can spot at least fifty goofs by the end of it. The script is so poor. I wonder what on earth made the producers think it was supposed to be funny. Every time someone laughed in the theater, I died a little inside. Seriously, 4 year olds can come up with better material. Even my pals who dragged me to see this hated it and their standard for a good film is way lower than mine. They apologized to me when it was over. I did not immediately forgive them.The visuals/special effects are dated but that doesn't really matter as this is (emphasis)supposed(/emphasis) to be a comedy movie. No comedy here though, so you will notice how bad all the acting, effects and everything else are.

Seeing previews for it before, i was familiar with the title but never saw it, i decided to plop this baby into my ps2 and see what unfolded. I am lucky my ps2 didn't throw this movie at my throat. From the start, there lacked a plot. Something about orphans going on an epic quest but that was quickly dismissed as the nacho libre joke came into play which a blind man could see coming from a mile away. The joke of him holding the NACHO!! scream for an extended time. Movie on from there, there was a repetition of every scary and date movie ever conceived. I did not even crack a smile during this movie due to absolute poor writing of every joke. I don't know how anybody could laugh at this because every joke had been done before in every other movies by these people. Scary Movie was the first..gave me some chuckles.....2 was the same thing with new movies, and after that it was just an avalanche of horrible cinema. If i could go lower than a 1 i would. however the ratings do not so i am forced with a one.

It looked highly unoriginal and the jokes were all lame and uninspired. I even boycotted it, and told my sister not to see it. I had been disappointed by Date Movie in a huge way and I couldn't bare the smell of defeat.--But, a few weeks ago, we found a box of DVDs and my sister wanted to watch it. Since there was no financial attachment, I agreed to watch it. Show of hands... how many people found it funny? Put it down... don't be modest. From the start I could tell that it was uninspired... but how so. They didn't change the Willy Wonka character (though the remake was a joke within itself) and the chocolate making thing was just unnecessary. It went on to reference Pirates, Narnia, and MTV Cribs without adding any original twists to it.

The reason is that the make money and there is indeed a market for them, that is perhaps the scariest thing of all.over all id say this film is a disaster there are times where i may say ""not my thing"" or ""I can see why people like it"" but no.

274,BengalTigger,This is an R rated film. Disgusting and perverse,2,27 January 2007,"I am ashamed to admit I saw this movie. ""Epic Movie"" is advertised as a spoof of many recent highly popular films. But, in reality, it is a spoof primarily on ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" with only minor references to other movies thrown in here and there. Even so, if that were all that was wrong with it, I wouldn't be here writing. Quite frankly, this movie provokes descriptions such as disgusting, disrespectful, perverted, vile, inappropriate,,,I could probably apply every negative word I could think of here, but you get the point. Here are a few of the many examples I could give for my negative opinion of ""Epic Movie"": --Lots of sex, sexual innuendo, some very explicit, many very perverse. --Producer obviously has an agenda. Many social norms are ridiculed and many social perversions are made to appear the norm. --LOTS of cursing including use of the ""F"" word. --LOTS of violence, not just sword fights and gun battles, bit people just out of the blue turning around and using brute force against the person next to them, repeatedly, for no apparent reason. And, this type violence is prevalent through the whole movie. --Many scenes based on watching people urinate.I honestly do not understand why this movie is not rated R and wish it would have been so that I would not have seen it.

Who the hell thought of this.To those of you who say 'You need a sense of humor to find this funny', I say you actually have to be either extremely retarded or a five-year-old who would laugh at anything.

281,dan_of_the_year,Proves that quality is better than quantity,2,26 November 2007,"Usually, I love parody movies. I grew up with the works of Mel Brooks, such as Spaceballs and Blazing Saddles, but also ZAZ's Airplane! and The Naked Gun. In my opinion these are wonderful, hilarious films that despite being silly, are also quite enjoyable.Sadly, the parody genre has degraded a lot over the last few years. I thought Scary Movie 1 & 2 were okay as well as Not Another Teen Movie, but this is nothing but a low-water mark in comedy. It's like they went into this project, thinking: ""Whatever, it's not like we're making a real movie, it's just a parody."" Well, a funhouse needs a good structure as much as any other building, or else it will fall apart.First off, the story, if you can even call it that, makes no sense. Don't get me wrong, inconsistencies and such makes other parodies great, but they also have some kind of plot, whether it's taken directly from a different movie or something original. What we have here is just a bunch of scenes put together where the humor depends too much on the likeness of the films they spoof.Second, the tempo is awfully frustrating. A good joke needs timing, whether it's quick or slow. In Epic Movie, the jokes are stretched out like saltwater taffy, as if the directors are thinking: ""Sooner or later they'll laugh at it"".Third, there are too many different movies from too many different genres in the mix. A spoof on Narnia should mainly be crossed with LoTR and Harry Potter, Superman Returns with X-Men The Last Stand, et cetera, but to go this far is just annoying.Fourth, so many good talents are wasted here. Seeing Jayma Mays acting like an overgrown, lisping 8-year-old just breaks my heart. She seems very sweet and I think she can do better than this. Same goes for Jennifer Coolidge. She can be really funny, but the only thing she did that I laughed at was this line: ""The kids have es-kay-puh-duh."" The fact that she never screams bugged me too. She's the bad guy, for crying out loud! A good villain should be able to be somewhat loud and menacing, even if it's just a parody. Heck, even Dark Helmet did that better than her.Thank goodness for people like Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg, known for their work on Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz. These guys know how to make good parodies/homages and they show us there's still hope. I know everybody has different tastes and opinions when it comes to movies, but people ought to be smart enough to figure out what they really want to get for their money. If Hollywood starts to notice garbage like this doesn't do well at the box office, there might be some improvement. Hopefully.",Epic Movie
282,dvallet-20927,If I filmed myself taking a dump for 90 minutes it'd be better than this rubbish,1,7 September 2015,"Clearly the people of this movie don't know the difference between parody and reference, and thus a convoluted abomination that has no right to call itself ""spoof"" was born. I personally like to see something to parodied if it's done with effort, take Spaceballs for example. That movie works because it takes a look at a Star Wars like universe from a comedy standpoint, you have a big powerful leader but underneath he's a complete fool, and it's funny because you may find yourself wondering, "" What if Vader was really like that?"" In this abomination against mankind they look into various pop culture references that are popular and do nothing clever and comedic, they just put it in the movie and say "" Hey, that exists!"" Rumour has it Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have never seen the films being mocked, they just saw trailers and said ""Okay, we'll do that one,"" and that wouldn't be surprising to say the least.While I sat watching this garbage, I instantly knew I wasn't gonna laugh. The ""movie references"" come off as painfully forced, like when someone plugs your nose to make you eat something you don't want. None of the references connect in any way, they're just there. The movie begins with narration from the Babe narrator which made me wish I was watching Babe. We then meet four orphans/siblings who are adults who require parenting because they never had a real family. First there's Lucy (Jayma Mayes), Edward (Kal Penn), Susan (Faune Chambers) and Peter(Adam Campbell). Yes these adults still need parental guidance, if that's the case, how did they even get where they are, they should be dead. Anyway they all win golden tickets to a factory filled with poop jokes and cheap gross-out humor, eventually they discover a wardrobe which takes them to enchanted world with the worst, rushed and unnecessary parodies. Lucy meets Mr. Tummies who takes him to his ""Crib"" where he gives a stupid tour of the place MTV style and then asks her to leave thus making the Cribs joke entire pointless.The only reference that made me give a tiny chuckle was the White Castle joke with Kal Penn, but everything else comes from nowhere and its atrocious to watch. The Pirates joke was the worst excuse to make the movie longer I've ever seen. Edward breaks out of jail with Jack Swallows after making a homophobic comment, where Jack takes Edward to his ship and gives us a music video but in a stupid turn of events, it was an elaborate scheme by the White Idiot (can't curse) to get information out of him. When the other three orphans meet the king, he agrees to help get Edward back in exchange for having a four way, I was ready to lose my mind at that moment. Thankfully the king dies after rescuing Edward, and before the war takes place the following day they throw a party, why? It's just pointless filler with gross-out humor that made me wanna vomit and I did. When the war happens Lucy, Edward and Susan die, and Peter pauses the bad guys with a Click remote he found, uses it to heal his siblings and they kill all the bad guys and they become rulers of the world, they urinate and they get rolled to death, movies done! This is one of the worst comedies I've ever seen, everyone in this movie is brainless, the acting is the worst, there is no existent plot just pop culture references, and it has a running gag in which Lucy repeats everything Susan says and it made me cringe every time. After I discovered this movie in my storage of old movies, I smashed it to pieces with a hammer. Nothing about the movie is good or redeeming about this abomination. This pile of rubbish gets a big fat F!",Epic Movie
283,http_dougie,"It was all I expected, and I had no expectations.",3,28 January 2007,"There is nothing new I can say that many other reviewers and IMDBers haven't already said.EPIC MOVIE is filled w/recycled jokes and simply tries too hard too often to succeed as what could've been a very well produced epic parody.The scenery and costumes were pretty exceptional, which helped ground the movie in reality. Even the acting was pretty darn nifty. Crispin Glover was an inspiring Willy Wonka. Carmen Electra, though recycled throughout the Scary Movies, still shows she can play the scene straight and let the jokes blossom... even if part of the joke is that she's a shape-shifting mutant who acts more like a pussycat doll in the hallway of a school. Faune Chambers played her role beautifully as well, and good luck w/those adoptive parents! Even Jennifer Coolidge stole my heart (""that's Stiffler's mom!"").It was the script itself that doomed this film. I really did enjoy the concept where four orphans from different cultures (and films) would meet up and go on a quest together, but the idea isn't enough when it's laced with poor dialogue and over-used references. Even the Pirates of the Caribbean music video, which I had seen previously on YouTube, was just too obscure for this film. I want to believe Jayma Mays is talented (I loved her in RED EYE), but that she was directed to be an even more stupid Cindy Campbell from Scary Movie fame, which numbed me from giving a damn about her. Overall this movie had great moments which I had wish would've lasted longer (X-Men, especially), but once it was cut together, those few moments of enjoyment just weren't enough. This movie is best saved for DVD when you can watch it while heavily drunk with your friends, but rather then rent it, buy it! ...and make sure it's the (inevitable) Unrated version, as there may be jokes you'll miss from being so far drunk and laughing w/your friends.",Epic Movie

You go from Borat, Prince of Narnia, to Pirates of the Caribbean and it's just mind numbingly bad there's no cohesion between the scenes and it makes it that much more painful to watch. There's not a single funny moment in this movie. NOT ONE. I challenge anyone to find a scene that is actually funny and gives you a hint of a smile.

What they forgot to mention is that the two who wrote it were only responsible for writing the credits and all the jokes deleted for the sake of not causing mass suicide. Put more delicately, this movie almost makes Pootie Tang look Oscar worthy, which ironically enough was made fun of in the last Scary Movie for being horrid. Coincidence? Yeah, not even some sort of Karma dealing fiend would wish this movie upon the world.""So,"" you ask, ""What makes it so bad?"" I bet your thinking that all of the funny stuff was in the previews, right? No, actually there was no funny content in the previews at all, it just seemed that way when taken out of the context of the movie. Much the same way ""Hogan's Heroes"" was funny to people who weren't in Auschwitz during the Holocaust, the previews are funny to those who haven't seen the movie. When you actually see the movie, you start to ask, ""Why was that funny in the preview?"" The answer: You can see pretty flowers if you ignore the fact that they are growing from the corpse of a man who died during a freak green house accident.Do yourself a favor, rent a History channel documentary on the history of documentaries and hit yourself in the head with a hammer. It'll be twice as funny, make three times more sense, and be only a fifth as painful.",Epic Movie

No, that's wrong, the worst movie ever is ""Men In White"" (you know, the one made for the TV). But that Epic B******T is very close.Of course i knew there would be no acting, but i did expect some laughs. Well, wrong again there. Although i remember i smiled in one - (repeat) - one - (and in number) - 1 part of the movie. All the other parts i was really crying the money i gave at the rental shop. For some weird reason, i thanked myself many times during the movie for not going to the theaters to see it.Actually, it's movies like these that makes us appreciate the real GOOD ones, so we should thank the producers for keep giving money to make horrible movies. They truly work for our benefit. Yeah. (Got to remember to remain serious).OK, only one advise. For whatever you think it's holy, stay away from this one. At least a country away.

My suspicions of an awful comedy came true and after seeing this, I realised the awfulness of Date Movie. I mean, how in hell's name is this even remotely funny!? Made up of a plot, heavily based on Narnia, complete with other awful films, such as X-men and Nacho Libre. What amazes me, is that some of the actors returned for this film. I now have instant dislike for Campbell, Coolidge and Willard, starring in this crap second instalment. Some of the other actors, such as Kal Penn, thought that because other epic films won awards, this film would!! A complete joke! Please, do not waste £7 on watching this film.

It is a spoof of other movies which, although not groundbreaking, at least tried to entertain above the waist. This movie is just a series of excuses for toilet humour, tired innuendo and the odd bikini clad babe. The script is plagiarised, diluted-with-sewer-water nonsense; the acting, even for this questionable cast, is plank-like at best; all in all a waste of your life and breath to watch.

I was forced into this by my now defunct ex g/f. After both of us witnessing the travesty that was Date Movie, I had thought she learned her lesson about these...abominations. But then she came home one day with Epic Movie. Out of the 6 people I was the only one to stay awake, and that was just because of sheer anger. I watched this film with the questions ""How?"", ""Why"", and ""Did I die and go to hell?"" running through my mind. At no point was this movie humorous in the least. If I had to listen to that Albino monk screech one more time I was going to drop the the TV and myself into the bath tub.I try not to be judgmental, but I think the ""2 of the 6 writers from Scary Movie"" are actually just conducting a worldwide survey that works as follows: If you see the movie, your a moron. If you don't, your free to live. The only way to stop this movie from being made is to have execution squads waiting at the exits of the theater to eliminate the sad excuse of human beings who find this crap enjoyable.P.S.

Epic Movie did not answer this question by putting its name up with Blazing Saddles or even Gremlins 2. The only reason this gets a 3 and not a one is because of the cast. Fred Willard was worth a point and a half with the other 1.5 belonging to Jayma Mays. I remember a small laugh here and there during the move, but I don't remember why or what I was laughing at 48 hours later. I do remember which parts were worse than others. The whole Willy Wonka satire, any line said by Captian Jack Swallows, any satire of Cribs, Punk'd, or any other MTV related show. However, I may be overlooking the true genius of this picture: It made big bucks. It took a genius to take this bag of moldy tangerines of a movie and make money with it. They got my $8.50.

What started out as a hilarious parody of heaps of films turned bad. Lucy from The DaVinci Code, Peter from X-men, Susan from Snakes on a Plane and Edward from Nacho Libre all get Golden Tickets to Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory where they are turned into food, all these scenes were funny, Lucy goes into a Wardrobe and finds to land of Gnarnia, that was the last good joke. They must now defeat the White B!#ch from her plan to destroy Gnarnia and create a Super-Continant. As i have said before a lot of the jokes fell flat, this would have to be worse than Disaster Movie, as the only thing that i enjoyed here that wasn't present in DM was a story, all in all this film has simply 20 minutes of hilarious jokes and then 60 minutes of bad ones.

According to the commercials, this was going to be another one to add to my collection.....WRONG!!!! I was so disgusted. I kept waiting for a payoff, something, anything. It was so flat, even the actors seemed embarrassed. Obviously the studio was planning on hyping the movie knowing that the first weekend is all the movie was going to have. Yes, there were a few (and I do mean a few) funny parts, but this entire movie could have been condensed into a MadTV skit that would have been just perfect. I literally fell asleep during the movie. Now, how many people do you know that fall asleep during a ""comedy""? I absolutely will not be attending another movie from these guys until after the first few weekends. I know if you were like me you would have to go see it for yourself and make your own determination, but please, I beg you, do not see this movie, do not buy or rent the DVD.

From the moment of David Carradine's humiliation (his lowest ebb on screen for sure)in a skit on The Da Vinci Code trundles on to screen at the start, you know this will be a train wreck. In my long history of watching films, this is without doubt the worst thing I have witnessed on the big screen. I hear Disaster Movie was pretty awful but 'Fool me once...' and all that, I dodged the bullet of watching it.The whole mindnumbing experience is simply a series of pathetic spoofs of blockbusters, with the merest thread holding the weak storyline together. Basically, there is no point going into what little plot there is as you would need a death wish to watch it after the sound advice on this site. Of course, some of you will watch it to see if it is indeed as bad as people are saying. Trust me - it is. And it's not funny in a 'so bad it's funny' kind of way. This is no Plan 9 From Outer Space! Oh deary me, no. This is a *ahem* 'comedy' which , unless you are stoned out of your mind, drunk to the eyeballs AND under 10 years old, will sit stony faced throughout. In fact, you will likely sit quietly seething, grinding your teeth and clenching your fists.The idiots responsible for this detritus should be imprisoned for crimes against humanity.

Ark (2005) should have a 1.0, But this... it was nice. I think it had some good humor attached to it (the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 reference, for instance actually does make sense, and made for good laughs in my opinion). Among other things, it had a plot and didn't needlessly generate discordance (hey, since we're speaking of spoilers, I'll put in a spoiler for people - Will Farrell's Get Hard. period).Point being, it's a lampoon of movies which came out at the time. And overall, it handled those lampoons quite well, and where it succeeded was making me feel relaxed and not perturbed (Will Farrell's Get Hard, people). So, jokes apart, watch it.

(If you've seen the clips during MTV video awards, you get the idea on the kind of jokes I'm referring to). Epic Movie tries to cash in on the Scary Movie, Date Movie, ""Movie"" Movie franchise, but doesn't measure up to the originality shown in the Scary Movie series.It doesn't take a genius to recommend that you save your box-office ticket money, and if you're interested, wait for the DVD, since this isn't an essential big screen movie.",Epic Movie

308,jedilink109,I hated hated hated hated hated this movie...,1,3 October 2007,"My friends and I watch bad movies all the time. Usually they end up being pretty funny B-movies and are pretty silly. For SOME INSANE reason my friend wanted to see this movie in the theaters. Well after seeing that I vowed to NEVER watch that movie again.I was at another friend's house one day and they had RENTED this for some reason (I must have some retarded friends or they at least have TERRIBLE tastes in film I guess...at least some of the time). One of them wanted to watch it. I ended up having to sit through a majority of it a second time. Well it turns out the second time was the ""unrated"" version (it just had different takes of the same shots where they said the F-word instead of what they said in the theatrical version of the film). It was no longer. Thank God. It sucks that it wasn't made shorter though because this film is TORTURE to sit though even ONCE.Up until seeing Epic Movie, the ""worst film I had ever seen"" title went to a movie my friend showed me one time called ""Malibu Beach Vampires"". I have seen parts of ""Malibu Beach Vampires"" since watching Epic Movie and ""Malibu Beach Vampires"" doesn't look like such a bad movie anymore.I'm serious, I have NEVER EVER seen a movie that I just absolutely HATED the entire time I was watching it, but THIS is the first. I have disliked movies, I have not been able to stand some movies, but there has NEVER EVER been a film I just completely hated before I saw this film. They try to make everything so wacky and it's just SO BADLY GRASPING for laughs that (when I saw it in theaters) no one was laughing! They think that the more retarded hip hop musical sequences and midgets there are in this movie, the funnier it'll be. Well I'll say it was more and more cliché, stupid, and annoying the more it went on.The film relies more on parodies than it does a cohesive story or any jokes that are actually supposed to be funny. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer I cannot stand you two. I hate to say it but you two SUCK. Your previous films have been ""parody"" comedies (if you can even call them comical in ANY WAY) and just recycle previously used jokes. A joke is funny when it's the real thing, not when it's a rip off, generic version of the same joke that was previously told in a better fashion.Jason and Aaron, I hope that you two never make another film again (even though sadly they ARE making another film) because your movies are unoriginal, generic, filled with horrid acting, reused jokes, and just abominations in the eyes of God and all of his people (which includes the entire human race). I'll say it again, before seeing this movie, I have never EVER just outright HATED a film but Jason and Aaron, your movie SUCKS! I intend to be a filmmaker myself and I can say that the few shorts I've made will entertain people more than this piece of trash.DO NOT see Epic Movie if you want to keep your soul in one piece. After watching this trash, I feel that a part of me has died and I want my money back for having supported this horrifying abomination. If Jason and Aaron expect me to see their NEXT film, they will have to pay ME because Epic movie was one of the WORST things I've ever witnessed in my life and will be one of those things I will shield my kids away from seeing some day. I hate this film.",Epic Movie

I agree there are different types of humour and that one's taste in humour may be different from someone else's. However, I fail to see how this comment applies to Epic Movie, seeing as it has no successful humour at all.I liked the first two Scary Movies, sure they were crude but enjoyable nonetheless. They did have several funny moments. In Epic movie, the humour is completely forced and is not witty, surprising, clever or any of the other prerequisites for successful comedy. It is an endless sequence of ill-timed and poorly written one-liners, sight gags and unfunny depictions of other movie characters. Honestly, the script seemed like it had been written by a bunch of ten year olds during morning tea. ""Like, make it that, like, Harry Potter's really old, and, like, it would be real funny!"" ""Yeah, and Hermione can be like, pregnant and smoking a cigarette! Ha Ha Ha Ha!"" I don't think so.Plainly, sxc bst has a serious humour deficiency.

I mean in the Pirates of the Caribbean scene, where in the actual POTC movie did it involve half dressed women, gyrating in front of the camera? Same with the first scene of The Lion, Witch and the Waredrobe. That's not parody, it's stupid, a bucket of sand could've wrote better material than this.Not only was the parody material very weak, the jokes (if there were any) and the humour in general was just not funny. I never even laughed or reacted at anything in this movie because there's nothing to laugh at.Those are the two point's that stood out to me while making the huge mistake of watching this movie, that and the fact that it was just awful in general, not worth watching even just to kill a empty 70 minutes of time.

If they do decide to do another spoof, which I guarantee they will do, lets hope its not revolved around someone peeing or throwing up for an attempt at a joke.4.5/10",Epic Movie

Scary movie 4, Date Movie, and this one Epic Movie, have been all the same humor lately, they aren't funny at all, i saw Epic Movie and i thought ""You know what? I would've boughten 2 blockbuster movies instead of seeing this movie for 5 bucks. I couldn't believe it, i expected much more from them. There were some okay funny parts but the majority of the movie was annoying and i wanted it to end.

And thats the best I can say about this movie. I think I may have gotten ONE grin out of the entire movie, it was more of an insult of my intelligence, I was ready to get up and walk out of the theater.

Typical of these productions, the humour was predictable and not especially clever, relying heavily on cheap gags, silly physical fights or just the plain idea of mocking another movie. Hip Hop comprises the majority of the soundtrack, with some songs re-used throughout. Darrell Hammond's imitation of Jack Sparrow was quite striking, but I thought the acting was pretty bland otherwise.Some may argue that the movie is meant to be as cheesy and stupid as it is, that it is the 'style', but I'm so incredibly grateful I didn't pay to see it.",Epic Movie
326,drquantumswildride,This Was Physically Painful To Watch,1,8 November 2016,"I do my very best to remain objective with my reviews. I do this so I don't come across as hyper-aggressive or fanatical. I force myself to watch a film at least three times before I review it. Yes. This film was included in that. Brace yourself, this one hurts. This is probably the only film I will ever address like this....Normally I would break the film down here, but this is a parody of other films so all the visuals and images are substituted from the base content. They don't tell jokes in this. This isn't a comedy movie. This is a film that aims to repeat, verbatim, everything the source material said to the point it becomes excessive, boring, and gives you a headache. I disliked Date Movie. I haven't seen a Scary Movie since the second one and from what I hear, I left it behind at the right time. This was the worst attempt at parody I've ever seen in my life and I've seen Reality Shows parody Human behavior. This was BAD bad. You can't even get a good riff going. It isn't bad on purpose. It feels like it was written by an unfunny twelve year old, whose parents had lied to them telling them they were funny, only motivating the little pr*** to keep trying. They shouldn't have kept trying. This cinematic abortion is probably the worst movie I've ever seen on all scales. I've seen The Room. I found humor in that. I've seen Dragon Wars. I found humor in that. This was just...crap. An attempt to take films that did fairly well, cash in on how recognizable the characters were, and then just repeat scenes shot for shot. This isn't parody, it's plagiarism. It isn't satire, it's copyright infringement in the worst of ways. I support free speech, free press, and free expression. That being said, this degree of stupid shouldn't be permitted to have Theatrical Releases. People paid money for this. I wouldn't buy it from a dollar bin. I wouldn't accept a dollar to take a DVD copy of this film. Don't see it. It isn't worth it. Try making a drinking game with the dumb scenes and you'll die of Cirrhosis before the first Act concludes. Don't buy this. Don't support it's official release, unless you plan on lighting any and all physical copies on fire. Kill it dead, bring it back, and kill it again.",Epic Movie

If you are younger that 13 you will most likely find this movie hilarious. If you have any taste, you will not like this movie.From what i saw of it, it's a bunch of lines that looks like they thought when they were writing it, ""i bet some stupid teens will laugh at this and recommend it to their friends"". it's obvious they were only thinking of a quick buck than to make a quality stupid comedy.0/10",Epic Movie

I went in expecting very little, and the movie didn't even deliver that much. Throughout the entire movie there are only a few scattered chuckles, and not a single real laugh. You really know that a movie like this has failed when its parody of another movie (an action movie!) is less funny than the original. This happens in its parody of Snakes on a Plane, which is really just a very silly reenactment of some of the funnier parts of SoaP.While severely deficient in the humor department, the movie is, however, filled with plenty of gross-out moments, so if you're into that, by all means go. But if you want to see a decent movie or if you even want to laugh at a silly movie, you should avoid this like the plague. Don't spend $8 on a movie ticket, don't rent it, don't even watch it for free. You'll just be wasting your time.",Epic Movie

It is disappointing to see that actors who have received some acclaim from both critics and the public alike have starred in this-the worst movie ever made-worse than Grease 2. And only a few minutes longer than a regular TV show except without interesting commercials, it is highway robbery to make anyone pay to see this half-baked movie where writers, producers, actors and directors have only put half an effort to do something that at least would be satisfactory. And half is giving them too much credit. Unfortunately for Kal Penn, Jennifer Coolidge, Faune A. Chambers and Crispin Glover (you waited for this movie to return to the big screen? where were you last couple of years? in detox?), I won't be running to the theatre any time soon to see one of their movies any time soon.Studio decision-makers have to take a stand against these movies-and so does the industry.

All the jokes have been done hundreds of times before already and usually much better. It makes Little man seem like a masterpiece (and that was a terrible movie too). Thank god it lasted only 70 minutes because there's only so much bad taste a human can take. I find it unbelievable that anyone would dare to sign his name to this piece of crap and that there is a studio who would dare to distribute such utter filth just to make a few bucks.

Jason Friedberg wrote scary movie 1, and did characters for scary movie 2,3,and 4. He also wrote Date Movie. I enjoyed all these movies and I believe gave them 5 or 6 stars instead of a TWO.Jason Friedberg really disappointed me here. I was cracking up like HELL in scary movie and date movie. In Epic Movie, i wanted to kill myself towards the end.I also respect Kal Penn from previous movies such as Harold and Kumar go to white castle, and when he appeared on 24 and Law and Order SVU. He was okay in this movie. His acting was not as best done as I thought it would be.but don't get me wrong, i laughed for a little while. Such as when they featured a scene from Borat,and Nachoooooooo Libre. But other than that the Gnarnia scenes, Pirates of Caribbean scenes, and Snakes on a plane scene were just ridiculous.Anyways to the breakdown, this movie wasn't greatly done. And was most definitely not worth my 9 dollars.

I also Hated the musical interludes, which i thought were so stupid. This movie was so bad, it made the movies it spoofed seem even worse. The borat look-alike was terrible, it didn't even look like him. The acting was terrible, i totally hated the whole thing. I wish i could give this thing a zero. I laughed twice during the movie.

Epic Movie at least had a tighter script,stuck more to the type of films it spoofed and I know that isn't saying much. Date Movie went all over the place,it hard to spoof already funny movies. So I gave Epic Movie a 7 out of 10 for the effort.Kal Penn was great in this and I hope to see more of him in leading roles.The Things I liked The Harry Potter part was funny I loved the Jack Sparrow parody The Use of the Witch,The Lion and the Wardrobe as the glue for the movie.I wont mention the bad, I think everyone has covered it.",Epic Movie

In fact, the funniest parts of this movie were the quick little references it made to movies such as Star Wars and James Bond.

Spoof movies have gotten worse since ""The Scary Movie"" series, which were quite hilarious, except the 4th one which wasn't as funny. ""epic movie"" had very weak comedy and was just a completely boring movie that i didn't find humorous at all, there were maybe a few chuckles here and there but other than that it was a waste of money and time and i can assure you that the box office didn't get much for this one. If some of you still want to see the film, you're lucky that you didn't waste your money to see it in theaters and are able to rent it for a cheap price.

The acting was horrible, the jokes were irrelevant, not funny,and actually stolen from real movies (when wolverine flipped off whats his face in epic movie, it actually came from an actual x-men movie), and we were tempted to walk out, but we hoped it would get funnier. It didn't. I don't remember a single time that I laughed during the movie, and quite frankly I'm getting really tired of the almost naked girls running around for no good reason (apparently the sexual fantasies of a 12 year old), the oral sex jokes, the irrelevant cultural references (Sudoku? please. A fifth grader could've thought of better jokes), and the potty humor. A 6th grader could've thought of a better movie, simply because I'm guessing that's what the target audience was. I'll give everyone a few words of advice: 1.Don't even bother with this at all. I wouldn't even waste money renting the DVD. 2.

The satire of Chronicles of Narnia is a travesty. The superhero satires were mildly amusing, however. The references to White Castle, another waste of celluloid, were hit-and-miss.

With all that's going on in the world these days, that's a precious and valuable commodity, and I don't think people should scorn it. I think one of the reasons this is the most popular film in theatres right now is that it's just plain funny and people like to have something to laugh at. While I liked Borat, which all the critics are apparently ga-ga for right now, I thought this movie was a lot funnier, had more plot, more gags per second and was less cruel to real people.Look, if you're looking for the latest depressing Clint Eastwood directorial effort, this obviously isn't it, but if you're looking for some ridiculous silly humor, this is a great way to spend a few hours in my opinion",Epic Movie

What is Epic Movie 2 going to have a take off of the ""D*ck In A Box"" segment? In all actuality though, the movie wasn't THAT bad. It was far superior to Date Movie, which I walked out of last year. But the movie itself is so short (iMDB says 86 minutes, but it didn't feel like it even cracked the eighty minute mark) that it didn't seem worth the price of admission. It actually didn't give you time to walk out even if you wanted too.The two (out of six) Scary Movie writers, Friedberg and Seltzer, were hit or miss with their bits. But luckily there were more hits than misses. I've got to tell you though; these dudes are OBSESSED with the black rapper and MTV culture. Every other joke is someone having a grill or break dancing or getting ""crunk"" or being a DJ on a turntable. And in Date Movie they did the ""Pimp My Ride"" joke, so of course here they've got to do the ""Cribs"" knock off. If you find that kind of thing funny, this ones a can't miss.But...I will admit I laughed at quite a few of the bits, and the performers did pretty well. Jayma Mays was spot on with her Anna Faris impersonation, and Kal Penn (who seems like he should have grown past these type of movies by now) was able to hold it all together real nicely...as was the rest of the cast. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie in theaters unless you're extremely bored and need to waste eighty minutes, but I would recommend seeing it when it comes to HBO or Showtime. It's decent for what it's suppose to be, but it's not really worth the price to get in.",Epic Movie
358,cherry_advocaat,What the hell was that?,1,14 February 2007,"I've just come back from watching Epic Movie at the theatre, and I have to be brutally honest but that has to be one of the worst movies I think I've seen. It wasn't funny, it was badly put together and the story was stupid. The acting was...OK, but almost seemed amateur at some points. It was over the top stupid. There is a line to be crossed with that kind of 'comedy' and it was definitely crossed. All it seemed to be about was sex, half naked girls, racial jokes and general lameness. I don't think I laughed at all but maybe smiled at one point. Some parts of it seemed to be completely random and irrelevant. Maybe it's just that American comedy isn't funny, or that this movie took it to a whole new level of dumb. It's also very short, which I suppose is a good thing because any longer and I might've walked out. The person I went with agreed that it was rubbish. I think that'll do. I don't recommend this movie, and I'll be surprised if it doesn't spoil the reputations of some of the movie makers or actors.",Epic Movie
359,elevator-room,How was no one able to stop this from existing?,1,27 January 2007,"I am an aspiring filmmaker and when I see all the endless scores of promising indies being lost in the festival pile it's tragic because I can relate to their pain, and their anxiety at not knowing if they're going to make it. ""Hollywood is incredibly competitive, there are a million talented people out there trying to do it."" So they say. And so I've grown a healthy jadedness about Hollywood, but do occasionally enjoy a good mainstream satire, even if it promises to be Sophomoric. But this film was so atrocious that it invites several questions, all along the lines of ""How the f--- did this film make it so far?"" If they had taken any writer from any decent TV show and said ""you have a week to make a parody of every trendy film from the last year"" they would have all come back with something better than this. How the hell did David Carradine, Fred Willard and Jennifer Coolidge attach their name to something so atrocious? Are Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer living in a complete f---ing vacuum? They don't have other writers that they can ask for advice? Friends? Family? Janitors? Is everyone they know completely mundane, ignorant and juvenile? At first I thought, ""whatever, I was stoned, laughed a couple of times, only ten bucks."" But then I thought about the moral irresponsibility of leaving so many filmmakers out in the cold and welcoming this garbage into Hollywood and it made me furious. Constant kicking of things around, breast jokes, fart jokes, vomit jokes, deus ex machina's, poor production choices, dishonest satirizing that doesn't even seem to understand what elements of the films quoted are worthy and appropriate for satire. I really, really hope that Seltzer and Friedberg throw in the towel, or have their feelings HURT out of over bad reviews and really change their perspective and philosophy on film-making.",Epic Movie

I was expecting it to be like the Scary Movies (which I find hilarious) but it was dull and unoriginal. In addition, it took innocent movies such as Narnia and Willy Wonka and turned them into twisted, perverted tales. I found it disturbing, and I am nearly positive that it would disturb any children that happened to see it.So, even if you want to see it, DON'T TAKE THE KIDS!!!!

364,JuniorBruce,What an EPIC waste of money...and life.,1,30 January 2007,"It's not enough that we, the movie going public, are forced to put up with half of the crappy films ""Epic Movie"" attempts to parody, but we're also forced to contend with ""Epic Movie"" itself. In regards to this film, and all others like it, I find myself scratching my head and begging the question: ""How in the Hell did this movie ever get made?"" While I've yet to receive any official response from the filmmakers behind this atrocity, I have come up with my own theory...Hollywood hates us. Wait, scratch that; Hollywood doesn't just hate us; they think we're stupid, insignificant creatures of habit, too. That we're nothing but a bunch of mindless apes willing to throw our hard-earned bananas down on any old piece of crap they manage to squeeze out that week. And it saddens me to acknowledge that to a large degree, they're right. We do throw our bananas down on just any old thing, as proved by ""Epic Movie"" being number one at the big B.O. opening weekend. How could we be so stupid as to fall for a film boasting a lame concept written by a bunch of comedic hacks who think ""I'm Rick James B***h!"" jokes are still relevant--let alone funny? I feel sorry for people like Kal Penn, Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, and Crispin Glover who seem to have become so jaded with their careers that they could confuse accepting this cinematic skidmark on their resume as something remotely resembling a good idea. Especially in Penn's case, as he's on the verge of shattering the Kumar image most people still associate with him.""Epic Movie"" is supposed to be a comedy, but there's nothing funny about it. Every joke falls flat due to either being poorly executed, uninspired, or just plain irrelevant. I'm all for parodies, but this film is so unfunny; it's not even funny.Oh, and next time--God forbid there is one--for ""Epic Movie II,"" why not try parodying truly epic movies? ""Spartacus"" or ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Battlefield Earth?"" At least try to follow your own stinking premise...for once.",Epic Movie

Made from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie, yeah maybe the two that had the worst sense of humour. It sucked, a lot of people walked out half way through and you can tell its bad from the very first line! If you want to go see a good film, go see Hot Fuzz!

All the funny stuff was in the previews!! And sadly, these previews were probably the only parts of the movie that could be shown on TV. This movie was raunchy, rude, disgusting and just plain foul. I suppose if that is your sense of humor, then it will go over very well for you. However, for me, it was all in very bad taste. I wasn't one bit surprised when the family in front of us with 3 young boys under the age of 13 left the theater about 15 minutes after the film started. This was certainly not intended to be a kid's movie. I don't even think I would let a teenager watch this one. It took one of the best kid's movies ever made and turned it into a nightmare. We felt it was so bad that we immediately had to go see another movie to get the bad taste out of our mouths and the horrible images out of our heads. Parents BEWARE! This is not an appropriate movie for anyone under the age of 21!! And even then, I wouldn't suggest it.

368,yescrack,Pathetic,1,1 February 2007,"Have you ever been in a movie wondering how long before it would be over, but it just kept going and going?I hate to say it, but this movie was just -plain horrible-. The idea of Epic Movie sounded funny (and could have been successful) but they failed horribly in its scripting and production.** The PRIMARY fault of this movie was they tried WAY too hard. Every chance they had to make some type of knock off they did, regardless of how funny it actually was. Also, there was entirely too much slapstick - like the producers though every person getting hit in some weird way would automatically make the movie more funny. **I feel very comfortable saying that I got my money's worth from finding out that Reno 911 was getting its own movie. The previews were by far the best part of this horrid flick.My final thoughts: If you really want to see this movie, just wait till it comes out in the discount theater (if you have them.) Or else just rent it on DVD. No reason wasting 5, 8, 10 dollars for a ticket.Hope this helps :)",Epic Movie

And when at the end of the movie, 4 of them get crushed by Jack Swallows. What was that?!! But there are some of the scene that makes me laugh a little bit. Like when Susan get kicked out from the plane and fall on top of Paris Hilton (the look-alike). And when Lucy freaking out and kicked the talking beaver (two times but different scene). I don't know what you guys think of this movie. But for me, I think it's a waste of time. Just like Date Movie. BORING!!!

There goes an hour and a half of my life I will never get back. If you were thinking about watching this movie, be smart, and stay away from it.

374,onomatopoeia11,Spoof films are becoming very unfunny,1,6 December 2007,"Epic Movie is so painful to watch, swallowing a cyanide capsule might be a better alternative. There are four orphans, each of them from the movie The Chronicles of Narnia. This movie begins by showing the audience the background of each character. Lucy is from the Da Vinci Code, Edward is from Nacho Libre, Susan is from Snakes on a Plane, and Peter is from the X-Men Series. First off, none of these films are ""epic"", they barely take themselves seriously. Then, the four orphans end up recovering a gold ticket for an epic adventure from the Willy Factory (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). What follows is a series of unfunny exploits that tries to spoof Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, Talladega Nights, Casino Royale, Mission: Impossible 3, Superman Returns, Star Wars, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Shrek, Click, Borat, V for Vendetta, Scarface, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, American Pie and Beerfest. However, if you think it ends there, you're wrong. They also parody Punk'd, MTV Cribs, 50 Cent, and take unfair cheap shots at other celebrities and shows. The film goes from one reference to another, never creating any valid storyline or joke. The characters they do parody end up doing dance routines (Jack Sparrow and Willy Wonka).

After all, the first two ""Scary Movies"" were hilarious so why not keep an open mind. I really wish that I could have turned my mind off during the movie. Maybe then I would have enjoyed it.I know that they were going for easy gags during the fight scene but really, the stunt man who doesn't even resemble the actor is just not funny.

I get it... its not meant to be an Oscar winner, but this goes beyond terrible. We get it, you can make fun of a lot of different movies in an hour and a half, but enough is enough. The first two scary movies weren't terrible(not my favorites) yet they still spoofed plenty of movies, the difference is they had a plot, and many of the spoofs were more subtle. I don't normally criticize movies because everyone has different taste, but I feel like it is my duty to society to warn you about this one. If I can convince just one person to not see this movie then it will have been worth it. I now have to live with the shame of watching this movie, something that nobody can take away.Here is a quote from IMDb's FAQs list ""There are many(spoofs), but the main plot revolves around ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", ""X-Men"", ""The Da Vinci Code"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", ""Snakes on a Plane"", ""Nacho Libre"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean""."" THE MAIN PLOT REVOLVES AROUND 7 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOVIES!!! In other words, there is no plot. That mixed with no humor makes a terrible combination. They jumped so quickly from idea to idea that i had no idea how the purple pirate midgets got onto the Death Star made out of swiss cheese(never actually happen, but you get the point.)It wasn't even silly to the point of being good, I spent the entire movie wondering how many movies they could possibly fit into a scene. Most porn has a better plot than this piece of garbage.You might as well watch Mad TV....if the writers were replaced by ADD five year old children picking plots out of a hat....and any possibly talented actor was replaced by a brain-dead chimp. There was too much time spent trying to tie everything together and throw in more references to make an actual joke. It was a terrible film.Its a shame this movie set out to be a spoof.

The first three Scary Movies were great, Not Another Teen Movie cracked me up, I even liked Date Movie except for a couple parts. But THIS movie was just sophomoric and juvenile...even for the writers of the previously mentioned movies. The script is comparable to someone taking a crap on a piece of paper, and saying, ""Oh, LOOK, it's a movie!"" The acting was mediocre, the story line made NO sense whatsoever. There were only two good things about the movie: The scenes with the Borat look-alike, and the guy who played Captain Jack Swallows. He was at least funny enough to get a laugh out of me...something the rest of the movie failed to do. Thus the two star rating rather than one.The part in which Harry Potter was parodied was especially terrible. Definitely NOT funny, it was simply disrespectful, pathetic, and stupid. If they're going to parody a movie in which the actors play characters who are much younger than them, Harry Potter is NOT it.I'm just glad we only borrowed this movie from a friend, and it only cost us a little bit of time to watch.

Perhaps the only bright spot would be Jayma Mays as the dim-witted, but cute Susan. While only a pale imitation of Anna Faris, she does make the best of a badly-written cliché of a role, (in stark contrast to her appallingly brief appearance in ""Heroes"" as the charming, but doomed waitress Charlie.) Hopefully, her nascent career will survive this dud and will become the one embarrassing role that haunts nearly every successful career. For the present, save your money and wait for this flick to appear on Netflicks. Even then it will probably not be worth the price.",Epic Movie
389,darkrapster,Only a movie to see if you have nothing better to do...,3,26 January 2007,"....and I do mean only see this movie if you have nothing better to do. I was actually excited for this movie sense the trailer look pretty funny. And when it came close to the movie coming out, it got a few good reviews so I had great feelings about this movie.Then I saw it....The movie really wasn't all that good. To start off, the beginning goes by pretty quickly introducing the characters with bland jokes and parodies. The rest of the movie was quite the same. With a combination of bad parodies, M-TV spoofs, and poor slap stick comedy the movie just fell flat.The only way to describe how I felt through this movie is that it was like a Bad ""You had to be there kind of story"" from an annoying co-worker, they tell you its gonna be funny, but as they tell you the story it just gets worse and worse.Sure the movie made me laugh a few times, but they were too few, and too far apart.Even the rest of the audience *and the theater was packed* laughed hardly except for an annoying fat guy in the back who laughed at everything and probably anything.*Spoilers* The only thing I actually thought was funny was the ending *even though it was kind of moronic* was how it incorporated one of MAIN jokes from the Borat movie *I'll let you guess what joke it is..........NOT*.Aside from that, the movie is really only worth it if you have nothing better to do.",Epic Movie

Just don't see it, it is not worth your money or time.Also, the reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because there were a couple of occasions where they had super-model quality models in bikinis dancing around, and the girl that plays Lucy is just incredibly cute, and she made me smile, as in her the person, not the material.

Ah, but that was before I saw Epic Movie.For the most part, I like parody films...I love films like Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, Spy Hard, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights, just to name a few. Yet, those are parodies with some taste and are they are actually funny. On the other hand, Epic Movie is a train wreck.Ah, where to begin...first of all, I thought much of the ""humor"" was vile and vulgar (or, what was at least supposed to be funny). There are several jokes about going to the bathroom, flatulence, impotence, vomiting, so forth and so on. Good parodies such as Spaceballs and Spy Hard can spoof without resorting to toilet humor...toilet humor is used in Epic Movie, and it is childish, gross, and not funny. In addition, many of the scenes parodied were just jumbled in the middle of the film and made no sense to the plot, such as a parody of Superman, a James Bond spoof, and the parody of Scarface. Many nonsensical jokes fill the plot of the movie. The numerous jokes about rap music are not funny, not even unintentionally.Avoid this film. It is absolutely awful. The only reason I didn't give it zero stars is because one is the minimum.",Epic Movie

They tried to pull of the ""it's so bad it's funny"" feeling, but trust me...they did not even accomplish that which is not very hard to do. And as I sat there in the cinema watching this mind numbing piece of $hit I felt like I was having a near death experience. I was praying to God that the movie would finish and was on the verge of leaving the cinema. The movie was made in an extremely unprofessional manner and there is countless amounts of noticeable mistakes.

395,mysekurity,A late-night sketch running way too long,1,26 January 2007,"You know those movies where if you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the good parts? I felt that way while watching this film. I don't typically expect much from crappy spoof movies, but I at least expect them to try. This came off as too much of a bad Saturday Night Live or Mad TV sketch that runs on way too long. A number of SNL's movies have felt that way, but really....Why can't they ever pick _good_ ""two of the six writers from Scary Movie""? I feel like I've seen this brand of dumb humor a million times before, albeit much better presented. I don't mind abstract references that would seemingly change the storyline (the four protagonists becoming part of Wonka's candy, but seconds later reverting to normal, for example), but these ""Family Guy"" style cutaways were so poorly done, it almost made me want to leave. I felt genuinely ripped off, longing for satires like Spy Hard, Last Action Hero, and Spaceballs. A friend and I debated whether this film or Scary Movie 4 was worse. We agreed it was a tie.The first two Scary Movies were funny because they didn't let the flat parts slow them down. Scary Movie 2 contained a number of bad jokes, but it was okay because the filmmakers had a general idea of where they wanted to take the ""story"", and at least made a concentrated effort to tone down the absurdist humor in places where it wasn't needed.Epic Movie temporarily halts the predictable, unfunny jokes close to the end of the film, when Kal Penn (who made two Harold and Kumar references, also falling quite flat, even amongst the largely tweenage audience) spells out the film's moral--a sappy and poorly placed monologue on the importance of family. The repetitive use of the word ""Bitch"" to refer to the antagonist, played by Jennifer Coolidge (""Stiffler's mother"" in American Pie, a point also mentioned) got tiring. I will admit there were a few laugh-worthy moments, notably in the name of Jack Sparrow's parody, Jack Swallows. The actors were all fairly devoid of talent (especially that kid from the MySpace movie, playing Ashton Kutcher), and the directing seemed nonexistent.Seeing the trailer is a bit of a spoiler as well, as you can tell when certain parts are coming up, effectively ruining the humor. Plus, the trailer has all the reasonably funny moments. It feels as if they directed the rest of the film as merely filler between the points showcased in the preview. I'm honestly not sure whether this review is in fact spoiling anything, because the trailer does a pretty good job of that on its own.My recommendation: don't see it in theaters. Don't rent it. Don't even watch it on TV when nothing else is on. Forget it was even made. Trust me, you're not missing anything.",Epic Movie

399,sohngg,Worst movie of the year - possibly ever,1,11 February 2007,"All I can say after watching this movie is ""How did this script EVER get green-lighted?"" It goes without saying that the latest ""Movie"" movie is by far the worst to date. Not only that, I believe this movie is certainly in the running for worst comedy of the year. The ""Movie"" movie franchise should have died with the original ""Scary Movie"", though I did get a small amount of enjoyment from it's subsequent sequels.""Epic Movie"" is a spoof comedy that revolves around several popular movie franchises that I suppose could be called epic - though the term is sometimes a stretch. Films such as ""Nacho Libre"", ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", and YES, even ""Snakes on a Plane"" make an appearance here. The movie is fueled by terrible writing, and is riddled with awful comedy. On top of everything else, the film is only 75-ish minutes long, which typically wouldn't be bad except for the 20 minute breakout in the middle of the movie where the faun of ""Gnarnia"" (Narnia) shows us his house a la MTV's ""Cribs"".The crude fart humor that this movie consistently pumps out at you is enough to make you want to choke. Essentially, that is all this movie is, as there is no solid plot line to speak of other than 15 minute forays the characters in the movie have with one epic movie to the next. Think of it as the story of four orphans who are kidnapped by Willy Wonka and escape his ""evil clutches"" by going through a magical wardrobe. I am totally serious.This movie should rightfully be getting a rating of 0/10, but for the sake of making SOMETHING about this movie funny, I have decided that it deserves 0.002/10. IMDb is requiring I give it at least a ""1"", which in my opinion is too high. Honestly it's that terrible. For those of you who are 12 or younger, or just in general enjoy fart jokes and bad movie references, there might be something here to see. Otherwise, steer clear!",Epic Movie

I saw it a couple days before its release. Going into it, I honestly was not expecting a whole lot from it. Scary Movie 1 had a couple of redeeming qualities, but they had been getting progressively worse. Date Movie, in my opinion, was the worst so far. That is, until I saw Epic Movie. There is not one moment of this film that I enjoyed. Every joke they did has been done to death. Every other scene in the film, they break out into a rap song. If this movie was rated R and had nudity in it, it might have given me something to look forward to. But alas, Carmen Electra was never seen nude. This is the worst piece of garbage to touch the face of this planet since Vlad the Impailer.SPOILER BELOW*****Not that there is anything to spoil because the movie is worthless, but in a scene where they are making fun of Snakes on a Plane, a man dressed as Samuel L Jackson comes in and says ""I'm tired of these god d*mn snakes on this god d*mn plane."" He repeats the phrase four times to try and be funny. He failed miserably. They spoofed a movie which was almost a spoof in and of itself. Also, they couldn't say f*ck because of the PG-13 rating. To quote a co-worker, they have to repeat the jokes in the movie, in case you did not realize that they were trying to be funny. For example, someone spoofing Pirates of the Caribbean bursts in and says ""I'm Captain Jack Swallows"". Then, Kal Penn says ""Swallows?!?!"" that stupidly fake inquisitive tone.

Instead, they take characters and concepts from some of the major movies of the last several years, most notably Chronicles of Narnia,put them in some lame and generic gags, most which deal with urination and goofy dancing, and offer only half hearted jabs at the movies they parody.

It is a tragic time and happens frequently among those who invite it in. I had the boredom bug tonight. It makes you do strange things that you would never do if you were thinking clearly. I called friends that did not pick up their phones. I eventually called one who suggested that me, him, and some friends all go see ""Epic Movie"" because they were going to see it anyways. Normally, I would not be phased by friends to see a movie I have sworn on two Holy Bibles not to see, but this feeling of boredom led me to go all the while knowing exactly what I am getting myself into.I tried on several occasions to get the fellows to see a different film, but I did not prevail. We sat in the theater, the lights went down and it actually started off really, really well. And by ""it"", I mean the previews. Gosh darn it, I wish they had gone on forever. Eventually the ""film"" started. I put quotes around film because I can not call this monstrosity a film. I can call it an embarrassment of technology. It's films like these that make me think that maybe humans don't deserve to live on this planet. Maybe just a big radioactive nuclear missile should just go off and take out the planet for millions of years. From where I'm sitting right now, it doesn't sound half bad.The movie begins and already we've got idiocy I've only heard about on the E! channel. As I sit through this movie, I start thinking of many ways to hurt myself to take away from the pain that I'm feeling. Randomly throughout the movie, I punch myself in the leg to deaden it... fun stuff. About thirty minutes in (what felt like three days in the Sahara desert with no water and a troll following you around telling you how gay you are) I haven't seen or heard a single solitary joke. I've heard scarce laughter, but I didn't know why! When something was said on screen when I thought ""huh... wow, is this what eating too many aspirin's feels like right before you die?"" others were laughing and going ""My, what humorists these thespians be"".By the end of the film, I had only laughed once. Yes, it is true, I laughed once and I think it was part because of something so unbelievable outrageous happened and part because I thought about if I worked at the movie theater and could run the reel to the film that I would do the decent thing and destroy all evidence that this actually hit theaters. It's been almost an hour since the movie ended and I haven't blinked yet. I think back to what the movie actually was: a film that basically had other actors portray characters from summer movies doing the EXACTLY THE SAME F***ING THING AS THE CHARACTERS IN THE ORIGINAL MOVIES!!! Oh, but they added a fart, pee, or poop element to them. I apologize for using such strong language, but I don't feel to well right now. It might be because the minute I got home I drank an entire bottle of drain cleaner to get out all the ""bad"" that Epic Movie instilled in me. The film also had the elements of randomly throwing in attractive blonde, scantily-clad women coming in to dry hump air to ""awesome"" (sarcastic quotations there) rap music. Shakespeare would be proud.This bulletin has been written for three reasons: a review, a warning, and a renouncing. That's right as of right now I am renouncing my faith as a Christian. There can't be a God if he allows movies like Epic Movie to be made and somehow led me astray to the theater and into that room, that dreaded room where I saw my life literally crumble into a thousand tiny pieces of badger excrement. I'm not mad, though. Oh no, I am merely embarrassed for us as a society that we can accept such trash into our theaters and pay more for it than a warm meal.Don't let the boredom get you, my friends. Here are some suggestions of what you can do instead of see this film: Buy a bunch of Sheryl Crow CD's and listen to them while cleaning your kitchen with a small toothbrush.Find a younger sibling and give them a screwdriver, then proceed to tell them to play dentist with you, you'll start by being the patient of course.Bake sugar cookies, but replace every element of sugar with chlorine. Bake for ten to fifteen minutes and enjoy.Go clubbing with Paris and Lindsay.Eat a live animal and don't cry. See if you've got what it takes to be ""a man"".Watch reruns of The Golden Girls while counting all the individual fibers of your carpet... naked.Urinate on some motorcycles outside a Biker Bar... see how fast you can really run.Shoot a cop... spend the rest of your life in prison.Just please... for the love of God... do NOT watch Epic Movie.

The script lacks substance....it's so empty. It could have been so good. I wanted to go in and have a great time, but I couldn't because it just wasn't funny.",Epic Movie
415,justletgo7,There was nothing epic about EPIC MOVIE,1,27 January 2007,"I just saw this movie last night, and I couldn't believe my eyes. First of all it was not funny at all. This has been the worst comedy movie in all of history. I thought scary movie 4, was not so funny, but i was wrong. Believe me I've seen them, all from Not Another Teen Movie, to All of the scary movies. Compared to epic movie, scary movie 4 was great. The rating pg-13 really made me upset, I saw last night a number of children, with the ages from 4-8 years old. This movie was very inappropriate, and the commercial should announce that. I saw a number of people walking out, by the middle of the movie. The commercial was funnier than the movie, and that says a lot in itself.I DO NOT Recommend IT, even i it was the last movie in existence. I thought with some many funny jokes possible with all those movies out, they would of come up with funnier spoofs. It barley included anything from other movies, it went entirely about ""Gnarnia"" It was not funny at all!!!!!!!! I hated it!!! It should win the award for worst comedy movie of the year.",Epic Movie

417,bigmacsflyingcircus,There is nothing Epic in this movie,1,24 January 2007,"I wasn't expecting much when I paid for my ticket to see this film, however this was the first time I actually considered leaving the theatre in the middle of a film because it was so bad.The main issue about this film is originality. This movie is merely a re-shoot of all the films it parodies with different actors. There is no originality in the script, the writers seemed to just bundle a whole heap of scripts of the movies they were parodying together and added childish slapstick bits here and there along with repetitive MTV references that never varied. This made the film boring.The main parody of the film is The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Those who have seen the film want to see a clever parody not to see every scene in the film re-enacted by terrible actors. If the movie had been any longer than 90 minutes I swear I could have shot myself.The film also recycles old jokes used in other terrible Friedman and Seltzerparodies. For example, Peter, Edward, Susan and Lucy are meant to be siblings and have the same parents yet are portrayed as a mix of black and white actors. This joke was used in the abysmal Date Movie, as the biological family consisted of a black father, Indian mother,and white and Chinese daughters. This joke was not funny in either of the films.Not Only does the film recycle old jokes from previous parodies but also recycles jokes within the movie, Jayma Mays kicking the beaver wasn't funny the first time, so why do it again.I just hope Friedman and Seltzer run out of genres to make films about.The film does nothing but expand on the trailer, I recommend that if you want to see the film, watch the trailer and save the money you would've spent on the movie ticket.",Epic Movie

419,niezzy315,Could have been a lot better (especially if rated R),2,29 January 2007,"This movie had potential to be funny, yet it just wasn't. The parodies were good, the jokes were sometimes funny, but the characters all sucked except for ""Kumar"" who was the only one that seemed to get what the hell was going on. They took the movie as far as they could, yet it needed to be even more insane to make it funny at all, so they should have just bitten the bullet and made a rated R movie out of it. Sadly they didn't. I don't really know if this pertains to the movie or not but it was really sad that my two friends and i were the only people in the theater that were laughing at the parodies, while everyone else was laughing at the idiotic side jokes, the draw obviously was too young and too ignorant. Don't waste your time going to this unless its your only option, but if your into poorly made movies and like to see films that you could have made better, this is the one for you.",Epic Movie

The acting was freaking awful especially the Snakes on a plane scene. Which I'm not going to spoil. And another thing that should be made an important point. IT WASN'T FUNNY AT ALL. Actually, only the ""Punk'd"" parody made me chuckle while the rest of the movie made me cringe.Now I don't want you to think I'm just another guy on the hate bandwagon.

A lot of the jokes do not land at all, instead they crash furiously into the ground and catch on fire. Straight up looks like someone made a movie out of a skit show, but instead of focusing on one skit they focus on all of them at the same time, even overlapping and making zero sense at many points throughout. They have an actor from Nacho Libre in the movie, but he ISN'T in the Nacho Libre parody. WHY??? HOW??? WHAT??? If you plan on watching this with friends, get ready to send out apology cards with a complimentary fruit basket because no one is going to like it or you afterwards.

This is a parody film that spoofs other movies like X-men, Da vinci code, Pirates of the Caribbean etc. Many people I know said it was bad and I thought ""Well, it can't be that bad"".. so I watched it, which I regret.. This is the worst piece of junk I've ever seen, everything in it is terrible, like the lame jokes (I think I had only 2-3 chuckles of the whole movie) that was just exaggerated and childish, the plot, the mixing of the films.. it was just long-drawn. I can't understand how I could stand the whole movie. Save your money and time on this one, and don't watch it. This is just trash that was made to earn money.",Epic Movie

While it does parody The DaVinci Code, Snakes on the Plane, Nacho Libre, Pirates of the Caribbean, Willie Wonka, X-Men, The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, Harry Potter, and tosses in a bit of Star Wars and Bond for good measure, it wasn't nearly as funny as it could have been. Probably because they tried to stuff too much into too flimsy a container. Even though the movie is relatively short, people, and I was one of them, began walking out not even half way through it. Save your money and rent it from NETFLIX, as it is sure to be there shortly. I also thought that the movie's passing homage made to bestiality, should have denied it it's PG-13 rating.

The movie travels along 4 orphans who meet by finding the 4 golden tickets to Willy's chocolate factory and stumble into a wardrobe to find gnarnia(G is silent). it was worth the 7.50 i paid to see it. The ending though will leave you feeling either disgusted or laughing hysterically. If you were a fan of Scary Movie 1,2 and 3 and said 4 was okay, or if you really did like 4 too then you'll like this movie a lot.

Alright if you look closely when they are approaching there is a price tag stem out of the neck mesh on peter. Its only there for a moment but it is such a big mistake that they didn't realize when the movie was being put together. If they did it was a good goof for this movie. But in the theater no one around me noticed it which is odd. But watch it carefully at that point in time and you will see the little piece of plastic that goes through the price tag.

So in other words, I had a totally open mind about it with no opinions either way. At first, I thought it was pretty funny. The first few scenes were well put together and well thought out. The second the ""children"" stepped into ""Gnarnia"", it all went downhill from there. First of all, Narnia was a perfectly good movie. You need to make fun of a stupid film if you are going to spoof it. Secondly, this offends many people that are Christians because Aslan represents God, and he is a drunk pimp in the movie. I know Hollywood probably doesn't care, but I don't think its a great idea to offend a large percent of the people who see the movie. So to sum it all up, I would sit this one out if you haven't already had the ""privledge"" of seeing it.",Epic Movie
428,loonduck91,the truth on Epic Movie,2,4 February 2007,"Okay, i laugh at everything. I tried to come into this review with an unbiased account of what you should expect. But this was just plain awful. The film begins with a Da Vinci code spoof, involving Lucy, one of the main characters, discover a clue in the Louvre museum. She discovers that ""lame"" has seven letters in it, and hurriedly buys candy as she is chased by an annoying psychotic albino guy who has a whip. the candy gives her a golden ticket, which leads her to Willie wonkas factory. Meanwhile, one of the other orphans, Susan, is on a plane. This becomes a parody of one of the most easily laughable films of the year, snakes on a plane. They discover the snakes...on the plane, and she is thrown out of the plane to crush a decidedly self-absorbed Paris Hilton. She finds a golden ticket in her bag. the humor ends here. all of it. The other two discover tickets in similarly ridiculous situations. once in the factory, Willie wonka reveals to them that he has an interesting plan for them, and fergie music blares as he traps them and harvests their organs for candy. They discover the wardrobe to Gnarnia (Narnia) in Mr. wonka's factory. Lucy, the first one in, meets Mr tumnous in a stupid cribs parody, and meets his life partner, the beaver. The orphans are separated from Edward, who was deceived by the 'white bitch'(ha ha very funny) and is now captive in a jail cell. He meets up with captain jack swallow, a pirate on a fake ship. Cue the scantily clad women dancing. the pirates then dance to rap music and we are sickened by a fat man washing himself. The writers apparently found this so side-splitting that they used this rap video type thing one or two times more. The orphans meet up with harry potter who agrees to teach them to use spells, fight, and such. I'm going to skip right over the part with the pregnant Hermione, and continue on to aslow's camp. they are greeted by, among others, James bond from the recent casino Royal. This just shows us how quickly they threw this thing together.there, everybody gets drunk, bonks aslow, and we are subjected to the thousandth unnecessary pop culture reference when they make a fat Britney spears joke. OK, the battle. they get there, realize that they are outnumbered, and are about to fight when the white bitch turns into an..er..extremely effeminate Davy Jones. He mixes a few rap tracks, everybody dances, and in comes Jack swallow on his wheel. an octopus attacks his face, so he looses control of it and just crashes. the writers have now backed themselves into such a corner that the only way they can get out of it is with a major cheat. Peter discovers the remote from click and uses it to stop all the opposing forces. they then take great joy in stabbing, spelling, and breaking chairs over heads of their frozen enemies. at the end, they re-discover the wardrobe, tumble through, and are greeted by borat when they are all crushed by the giant wheel.the end. Okay, there are many things which would have been funnier than epic movie. among them... 1) a six year old making her dog dance to la cucharacha. 2) eating a chunk of asphalt. 3) shaving your hairy great aunt bertha. 4) OK, i've been to funerals with a better sense of humor. So,if you are looking for a laugh, save yourself the 86 minutes, see another movie, go bowling, attend a funeral, just please, don't see epic movie.

On the other hand some bits made me laugh out loud. Yet their are far to many hip hop references. So funny Parody's Borat, some Narnia, Davin chi code, Superman, Willy Wonker (kinda) Yet the others (such as Pirates of the carabbean & MTV cribs) are really kinda lame.

Even Crispin Glover from Back to the Future played a good Willy Wonka. I'll give you this, parts dragged and even went very lame a lot, but if you laughed at all and I'm pretty sure you did, it can't be the worst movie ever.

I found this movie to be a whole lot funnier than other so-called comedies like Sideways, which I found to be extremely depressing in many ways. There was nothing to get bummed out about in this movie. It was just funny, and my kids also liked it. I guess this is a movie where you either love it or really, really hate it, judging from the votes. By the way, I also found the Scary Movie franchise very, very funny, and they kept making these.

First off, one should not be surprised that the Wayans brothers produced this egregious embarrassment to modern cinema as they are now infamous with films that try much to hard to be funny, only to fail horribly (Little Man, Date Movie, etc.). Secondly, making jokes about other bad movies like Nacho Libre is sad and really makes you realize how little effort was put into this production. Next, we come to the mediocre acting, I could have done a better job if I had been high on quaaludes while reading a script backwards.

IF you watch other movies then you will get the humor associated with this movie. If you haven't watched (or are updated) on movies you obviously will not understand or even comprehend the message in the humor it is suppose to pull across. It is a DVD Rentable, defiantly not worth spending a lot on to take the whole family to the movie theaters. But you will obviously get an average laugh, and take out the number of errors in the movie (Which I don't know were on purpose or poor camera crew.) you will laugh at some parts (or not.)

On the other hand, it did give me some laughs, so I can't say it was an entirely bad movie. It actually has humor in it, but it can also get a bit disturbing.. I suppose this movie was meant to be utterly stupid.. so you just have to be the kind of person that is able to laugh at this kind of stupid stuff, and make a fool of other movies (even if you do love the movies it makes fun of.) In conclusion, this movie kind of sucked, but it can cause a few laughs. To be honest, I WOULD watch this movie again, but only for a few bucks.

I'll explain the best I can. I saw this movie when i was younger in the theaters, and i was with many of my mischievous friends. We were in that stage when being the biggest menace to society and crude as possible was cool and fun. We sat down and watched this movie in the theater, and laughed our butts off. Wanna know why? Because we were kids who didn't care about the ""plot"" or anything like that. We just wanted to laugh and have a good time. And the crude jokes just made that easier for us. We didn't expect to see some ""work of art"" or something like that, we expected to see a batch of crude jokes and stupid spoofs of movies we have seen. I guess you can call it immaturity.

The movie also relied heavily on the fact that Kal Penn was in White Castle with the guy from American Pie. They actually show White Castle, which is where the White Bitch lives.

The only other mildly entertaining moment was the naked chick coming out of the wardrobe...I see some reviewers have said EPIC MOVIE isn't as bad as DATE MOVIE. I beg to differ.

The jokes are just bad upon worse, when they can even be called jokes. The rest of it are tons and tons of references to other movies. I won't even bother listing all the references and so called ""parodies"" this movie does, because my fingers would probably start bleeding from too much typing.No joke got a proper laugh out of me and no reference was funny.

Because I refer to a Marvel superhero but say nothing funny about it. That's how most of the movie's references work. The ones they try to make a parody out of are just ruined one way or another, and without a proper storyline with actual effort put into it, that's really all the film is hanging on.The film is terribly unfunny from start to finish and all I could think of while watching it, was: ""Make it stop"".

Then, Willy tells the orphans, that there will be a piece of them each in his candy. It's what makes it so delectable. He locks them in the candy room, and takes a body part from them each.

Date Movie was an atrocious film that is a disgrace to spoof movies everywhere, so, naturally, I wasn't expecting much out of Epic Movie.I was pleasantly surprised.While it is nowhere near the level of some of the great spoofs of the last 3 decades (Airplane!, Wrongfully Accused, Mafia, Hot Shots, Scary Movie, etc.), Epic Movie certainly has it's moments.Though it contains a lot of the unfunny, ridiculous drivel that is apparently a feeble attempt at spoofing that we saw in the last film, it has quite a few worthwhile, funny moments.It starts off quite unfunny, but don't give up on it too early! It does go somewhere, and the film really gains steam as it progresses.The highlight of the film is Darrell Hammond's GENIUS spot-on parody of Captain Jack Sparrow from the Pirates of the Caribbean. He truly does a masterful job spoofing the character.Please note that you will have to be sitting through the numerous spontaneous hip-hop numbers that appear in Date Movie, but they're mercifully few and far-between.Over all, I'd give Epic Movie a 6, purely for it's spirit, and Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg's drastic improvement in quality from the last film.I'd say that the next one might actually be a decent comedy film.",Epic Movie

470,aplivings,Not completely terrible,6,15 September 2013,"I watched this film for the first time in September 2013, with my wife, broadcast on TV quite late at night. Not paying to see the film, not seeing it in 2007, and seeing it after some of the actors have become more familiar provides an altogether different perspective, and possibly this film's reputation deserves some rehabilitation.The fact that we only started to watch it during the 'Nacho Libre' scene and didn't change the channel immediately I think has to be a sort of recommendation. In fact after settling into it we managed to watch it through to the end. And it wasn't completely terrible!There's a mixed bag of humour, from very obvious visual gags, contemporary cultural references and parodies, and the whole storyline is creatively stitched together in a kind of absurdist humour, reminiscent of Monty Python.It was quite nice during the character introduction to recognise actors like Jayma Mays, Kal Penn, and later Jennifer Coolidge, from their later appearances in hit US comedy shows: Glee, How I Met Your Mother, and Two Broke Girls. But of course six years ago they were still relatively unknown, and so that dimension of familiar recognition would have been lost. Shame. But it speaks highly that the casting director picked out such talent back then, and they each play their roles quite well.As a TV movie it definitely works, and approached with low expectations can be pleasantly surprising. It doesn't look 'cheap': the indoor sets are very creative and well finished, the photography is pretty good, and as mentioned the talent also delivers. It doesn't take itself seriously, at any point, and frequently breaks the fourth-wall to remind you of the kind of movie that you're watching.Even the cultural references have a kind of a point now. This films dates itself very firmly by references to the source material of the time (all of which I saw back then) so it was nice to be reminded of those other great films that I did enjoy, six years ago. I doubt I'd watch it again though. I certainly would not have paid money to see it, but then professional film critics never pay either...",Epic Movie

Throughout the plot is weak the premise of the film seems like a good idea but is poorly executed.tie ins to recent films are also poorly done as jack sparrow just appears during the middle of scenes and this sets the trend for the movie. the humour also is very weak when given potentially funny situations the butt for many of the jokes seems to be mtv i say mtv come out better for it, the humour is inappropriate and painful, the writers of this film really have to have a long think about what went wrong here before setting out on a new movie.the worst movie iv ever seen by a long shot made those 93 minutes seem like an entire lifetime including the horrific death.",Epic Movie

This is the movie for you.However, it might not anyway with all the other weird and stupid stuff going on.I was expecting this movie to be so bad it goes full circle and becomes so bad it's good. And my expectations seemed to be fulfilled in the introductions of the main four characters.But the minute they turned up at the chocolate factory, I discovered that this film went full circle twice, and become excruciatingly painful to watch.After watching it from start to finish, you may have a strange feeling that you might have felt somewhere before... The moment after you've just had an accident in your car or on your bike or board that you weren't expecting, and for a few moments you are left dazed and confused. You have no idea where you are, what you're doing, and what just happened. The it all comes rushing back.NEVER watch this movie.

Unfortunately the movie turned out to be a complete, utter disappointment.A story about 4 orphans and their journey from the Wonka factory to Narnia held a lot of potential as a spoof on epic movies.Everything from the storytelling, to the editing, to the acting was so amateur and so not funny - it seems like a bunch of 5th-6th graders got together and made this movie!

In parodying said films, they merely reconstruct the setting (poorly) i.e. Willy Wonka's chocolate river becomes poo. The references to pop culture are 1: over used 2: Poorly used 3: Irrelevant and not funny. It appears that the budget was spent on midgets and a dance choreographer (apparently it is funny when medieval knights, pirates, dwarfs and oompa loompas dance). The narrative is infantile and not remotely funny, no imagination could possibly enjoy the pure nonsense of the characterization. Parody films are meant to parody and this one fails to come even close to funny, it irreverence is pathetic, not hilarious and the writers...well, where to start with them.If you like watching pictures move and people talk, this film is probably for you. If you like films that are intelligent in their parody and genuinely funny, then stick to the Scary Movie catalogue. Even Date Movie was better than thisand that's saying something.This film trades on the pretension that it will be funnyit is not, someone should report it to a fair trading body.

If you are considering watching this movie you should instead shove a fork in your eye. The flashing lights of the ambulance will be far more entertaining than this movie was and the pain will be half as bad. This movie was just one unfunny, pointless, idiotic, pop culture reference after another. From the ""parodying"" (and i use that term loosely)of cribs which was completely pointless to the river of poo instead of chocolate in Willy's chocolate factory. Instead of trying to make clever, witty, and funny jokes they try and parody as many movies as they can as the writers feel that is what people want. I miss the days when spoofs actually had clever references and subtle jabs to the movies they were parodying. Mel Brooks was the master of the spoof genre and made some of the funniest movie because he understood how to make references to movies and not have them entirely consume the spoof itself. The writers of this awful, awful movie have put a stain on American cinema which i hope will not be a model for future movies.

The only amusing satire was from the ""Punk'd"", Cribs, and the Jack Sparrow parody's. The rest was just a string of jokes that are far too overused (terrible Magneto satire, and lame sexual humor). Though, expecting to see an intelligent movie is being a bit unrealistic, expecting good (or at least so immature it is amusing) satire is not asking too much. This movie failed to deliver in most categories, and unless you are wanting a movie that is overall just overused humor, I would not recommend seeing this movie unless you don't have to pay and are willing to sit through about 45 minutes of lame humor.",Epic Movie

The trailers were obviously supposed to bring a 'funny movie', but unfortunately the trailers were* the funny parts. Enough said.Now about the movie: When I came in and saw the movie the first thought that went into my mind was.... ""Oooooookay, was this supposed to be funny in this part?"" Now mind you barely some parts were stupidly funny (As in teasing the movies they used) Most of the actors were poorly picked for the parts we god awful as well, except the man who played Captain Jack Sparrow, or rather in the movie, Captain Jack Swallows, did actually sound close to Johnny Depp. Personally I feel Carmen Elektra would do any part to make money for anything when she played Mystique since she might be close to bankruptcy, you never know.Overall put, the movie....not funny. The movie tried to be ""too funny"" to be funny at one time. If you ever plan to see this, take my advice...don't go! Poor cheesy quality jokes, Very sick humor, A plot line that could of been good if only they would have had different writers for the movie.

It did make fun of some classic movies, such as ""A Christmas Story"", but even that scene was not funny. The plot was entirely based on ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"" and a lot of the jokes were just disgusting. The movie tried to become the ""epic"" movie by including references to not only other movies but also to many television shows, and as a result the jokes became old very fast.

It has way too much sexual suggestiveness and swear words to be PG-13. I took my kids ages 13, 9, and 7 and we could not believe our ears and eyes. I have taken the kids to many PG-13 movies that were totally appropriate. This movie was totally garbage and whoever made it should be ashamed of themselves. Hollywood is turning out some real crap these days. There are enough problems in our world today. Why don't these producers and directors take some responsibility and stop turning out this kind of crap. Too many kids are learning bad behavior and language from today's stupid movies....what a waste of $50.",Epic Movie

The movie kind of sucked. But I'd still see it again.It might not be a 5 star kind of movie, but it's ripping the box office up.Doesn't that say something?",Epic Movie
510,Elysium-15,Terrible...,1,15 February 2007,"First time ever i was speechless after the movie... because it was so damn terrible.OK, before i start bashing Epic Movie, i'll admit that there were at least 3-5 funny parts within the movie (luckily they spread them throughout the movie, otherwise if they carried on with pointless gags, i would of just got up and left the cinema).After watching ""Harold and Kumar - Go to the White Castle"" (good comedy movie), seeing Kal Penn's face in ""Epic Movie"", i would of thought it would be hella funny... (might be just me, but without any materials with Swearing, Drugs or Sex, a movie cannot be funny).It was just so badly scripted (even though it does not have a script, but just ripping other movies off, at least try to pull the movie together).Lucy (Jayma Mays), who i am assuming is trying to be like Cindy Campbell (from Scary Movie, which she cannot pull it off) just tries to hard to act stupid and hardly isn't funny at all.Peter (Adam Campbell), being British myself could not see the funny side to him. He was not funny in Date Movie either... only part i found funny in Epic Movie with him was the superman part, that was about it.Susan (Faune A. Chambers), i wasn't expecting much from her and pretty much didn't see any comedy from her anyways.Edward (Kal Penn), i expected him to be funny... but he wasn't... the chemistry between him and the a other actors just was not right and just made him boring.Well to sum up, ""worst episode ever"" (aka. Crap Movie). You are better off watching Scary Movie 1/2/3/4 (and upcoming 5)Don't waste your time watching this movie, you will understand if you have watched the movie already and you are reading this comment... if not, wait for the DVD and rent it then you'll understand my comments...",Epic Movie
511,montyman1,Absolutely Awful,1,13 February 2007,"This is quite possibly the worst film i have ever had the misfortune to pay entry for. Myself my girlfriend and six friends went to see this awful attempt at comedy only to leave halfway through. The acting was terrible, the jokes were so poor they begged belief. I can't believe that this rubbish made it to the final cut, let alone made general release. The parody's were so weak. The story has been shoehorned together with absolutely no attempt to make any real sense. After seeing Hector Himenez in the brilliant Nacho Libre i was so disappointed to find him amongst this dross. This film will surely ruin the careers of the actors/actresses involved. Why does America churn out these pitiful attempts at humour when they surely must know how bad it is. If you have an enemy or want to make one buy them the DVD when it comes out, it will most definitely offend. I would like to point out that since suggesting going to see this movie my girlfriend has left me, my friends no longer return my calls and people i don't even know shout and throw things at me in the street. You have been warned !!!!!",Epic Movie

That being said, You will not stop laughing throughout the entire film. It's basically about 4 orphans from various backgrounds who are outcasts (spoofing The Davinci Code, Nacho Libre, X-men, and Snakes on a plane). They all wish they could leave, and they all find Golden Tickets. They go to the chocolate factory, (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), and they meet Willy, who makes his candy using human body parts. they run away from him and find a hidden wardrobe which takes them to Gnarnia, where they meet Jack Swallows, (Pirates of the Caribean), and Harry Potter. there they must save Gnarnia from the White B**ch.

Very poor storyline, unless you really like Narnia sorry Gnarnia! I enjoyed Scary Movie, but this type of film has become too predictable, sorry to slate it but laughed twice(maybe). The plot line, whilst attempting to use reference to some 'epic movies' jumped around the place, but only really focused on Naria, although there were some interesting references to other actors and famous people, sometimes just for the reference point - poor Paris!

Don't fall for the same trick , saying I giggled 2 times during the movie is exaggerating blatantly . The humor is predictable and very VERY lame and i highly recommend against anyone putting themselves through the horror of watching it.It attempts to mock several high-budget Hollywood productions such as The chronicles of narnia , x-men or The pirates of the Caribbean .

So, for those who have rated it poorly, get a sense of humor.All the four main characters of the movie are good. Kal Penn is very good. This movie (I felt) was good for passing time.

The pirate looked and sounded just like johnny dep from the movie. I mean it had some dumb parts, but overall it was a great movie, way better then date movie. I think some people took the movie to seriously and didn't find it amusing at all. But all the movies they used to make fun of, i had seen and thats what was funny.

If you are looking to see this movie then I warn you that the humor is crude and inappropriate. If you don not enjoy content in movies like this, then I say that it's not likely that you'll enjoy you're 87 minutes that you could have dedicated to some other activity.

A lot better than Date Movie, And more of a plot than Scary Movie. There were some parts I say that could've been made a lo better. I especially thought that the Willy Wonkas factory could have been much longer. It didn't go on for very long. And the characters could have appeared more in the movie.

There weren't any good parts except for maybe the Paris Hilton part (which was the one part that made me chuckle). The Willy Wonka part was disgusting, the Superman part was stupid, the Da Vinci Code was pointless, the Snakes on a Plane was extremely stupid with that guy just repeating the same line over and over, and the Pirates of the Caribbean part was not even funny and perverted (which is why I'm glad I didn't go with my parents). It was all stupid/elementry school jokes basically the whole time during this movie.Overall-It sucked more than I thought it would....They said it was from 2 of the 5 makers of Scary Movie??

Blondie (The Good) is a professional gunslinger who is out trying to earn a few dollars. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is a hit man who always commits to a task and sees it through, as long as he is payed to do so. And Tuco (The Ugly) is a wanted outlaw trying to take care of his own hide. Tuco and Blondie share a partnership together making money off Tuco's bounty, but when Blondie unties the partnership, Tuco tries to hunt down Blondie. When Blondie and Tuco comes across a horse carriage loaded with dead bodies, they soon learn from the only survivor (Bill Carson) that he and a few other men have buried a stash of gold in a cemetery. Unfortunately Carson dies and Tuco only finds out the name of the cemetery, while Blondie finds out the name on the grave. Now the two must keep each other alive in order to find the gold. Angel Eyes (who had been looking for Bill Carson) discovers that Tuco and Blondie meet with Carson and knows they know the location of the gold. All he needs is for the two to lead him to it. Now The Good, The Bad and The Ugly must all battle it out to get their hands on $200,000 worth of gold.

You can no longer go see a good movie or turn on a TV show without having it infested with profanity, violence, and/or sexuality. Is this really how we want future generations to remember us? What's worse is that the commercials portray it as a good, fairly clean movie, maybe not an award winner, but a movie you could see on a Friday night and actually enjoy. I went to see it expecting a good laugh and all I got, for most of the movie, were girls who were wearing clothes that barely covered them, if they were wearing anything at all, and men who gave the image that these girls were doing things that they liked. While some people may enjoy this, a far majority of the population does not find girls who display themselves in revealing ways appealing. So, if you have the urge to see this movie, you can get the same experience in your own house, without paying 10 bucks.

In theory, the idea of mashing up all these movies in one 'Epic Movie' was rather fabulous. I know that's pretty much what spoofs are all about, but some of the movies that they chose to put in 'Epic Movie' could have made something really very special and absolutely brilliant. But, sadly, that's really not the case; it's just not funny. I laughed out loud in the cinema once and then immediately felt bad because I was the only person doing it. With the exception of two 12 year old boys in the row in front; I envy them the fact that they found it hilarious.All this said, I got home and when I thought about all the separate little jokes and spoofs, I really did have a good laugh. I think that the 'setpieces', I suppose you could call them, were actually really funny out on their own - I laughed for about half an hour about Sudoku in the snow when I got home - but putting them together weakened them. It just didn't work.Although, I have to give kudos to Darrell Hammond for his 'Captain Jack Swallows' (how obvious was that joke going to be?). He provided my one laugh in the cinema and also did a pretty good impersonation of Jack Sparrow.Is this movie a sign that the spoof genre needs a rest? I certainly think so.",Epic Movie

First of all, as you probably guessed, the plot makes no sense at all. Fine. I can live with that. But when the jokes are not funny at all, you have nothing to fall back on. Here are some examples of the ""humor"" in this movie: During the Nacho Libre spoof, Kal Penn doesn't want to eat his food, so Nacho yells NACHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO cheese Doritos are delicious! WTF? Was this movie written by an eight year old? Here's another: During the Narnia spoof, the goat man accidentally hurts someone, and says ""My baa-a-a-a-d."" Hmmmmm. Another thing, when you make spoof movies, it is okay to have characters get injured and then magically recover. BUT.... not when their HEAD IS KICKED OFF AND SHIPPED TO A CANDY COMPANY! I mean really, her head reappeared two seconds later! AND ANOTHER THING! WHY THE F#$@# WOULD YOU SPOOF CRIBS AND PUNK'D???? Those shows are so old, and have been spoofed countless times over the past few years. You know, there are people out there spending $10-15 to see this disgraceful tripe, and the very fact infuriates me. I have totally lost respect for everyone involved in this film. Why Fred Willard?

The movie was very creative and funny. I think they did a good job on the trailers by not giving away all the funny parts. The characters were brilliant and comical. I would have to say I would like to go see it again. It was actually more funny than I thought it would be, because date movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be.

It didn't take long before I wished I was sitting next door in Night at the Museum. Aside from the lack of inspiration/wit, I think this movie's biggest problem was its attempted scope.

The ""segments"" in the trailer is pretty much all that particular spoof is, they last no longer and have no more jokes. The only movie they seemed to make fun of was Narnia, and even that was done somewhat poorly. Not to mention the string between all the movies was weak and made hardly any sense. The budget was also pretty cheap, and was silty reflected in the film. Not to mention the movie seemed to be strung together pretty quickly. And finally, it has too much humorless physical violence, lets face it, no amount of hits in the cock is going to make the movie any better.

But this movies was just not him....to be honest this movie never even made me smile. In Fact it was hard watching the movie. One of the reasons could be watching a lot of his movies and now all of this seems predictable and the comedy in his movies is not new to us anymore. I guess he should try his hands in something else rather then making spoofs.He can surely surely do better then this and come up with movies which can really make us smile and not movies like this which are easily forgettable. These last two movies i.e the Date movie and the Epic movie don't show what kind of capability he has as a director. Any ways I will be awaiting scary movies 5 and although I know it will be another spoof of some big blockbusters I will try and forget the Epic movie and watch scary movies expecting a good comeback by Jason.,Epic Movie

About a third through this movie i wanted to get up, walk out the theater and smoke a cigarette. i understand that spoofs are child-like versions of some of the top movies in the past year or two. epic movie went beyond that and included some parodies that normal teens,who would go see this, would not understand. i experienced this first hand when i was the only person laughing at numerous parts of this movie. i do not suggest seeing this movie if you are of sound mind. there are quite a few dead parts in the movie, i thought at least, where i was just sitting in my seat wondering where is this going and why is it not funny. epic movie will not go in my collection of movies. way to start off 2007 with a bomb.",Epic Movie
543,sxc_bst,I object to the comment made from bigmacsflyingcircus from New Zealand,8,26 January 2007,"I must admit that this movie was not as Epic as i had first thought it would be. Although it did not for a moment disappoint me.There are many different types of humor and bigmacsflyingcircus from New Zealand must not have the same sense of humor that the creators of Epic Movie have or the majority of people that fully enjoyed it. If you did not like Scary Movie then it is obvious Epic Movie will not be your cup of tea. I think that the people reviewing this movie should have that particular sense of humor associated with parody movies. I am one of those people and i loved the Scary Movies, my favorite songs are my Weird Al Yankvich and i was in hysterics for a lot of Epic Movie.So a word of advise for people who review movies... Of course there are going to be bad comments if the person doesn't enjoy the genre they are critquing, so give every movie a fair go and let it be judged by the true fans of that genre. We are the only people who could really judge the quality of one parody movie to the next.Thankyou and goodnight.",Epic Movie
544,claystreet6996,Just Another Rental,6,26 January 2007,"Just as Date Movie, Scary Movie, these shows are good usually one time only. They're good for a few laughs, especially if you are wanting to see other movies made fun of. But overall save your money and rent it later, or get it from someone who was foolish enough to buy it. A lot more could have been done to make this a solid movie, but as in all parody type movies, what do you expect? There are basically 4 kids, well, college age anyway, who have crappy lives and all their misfortunes lead them finding the tickets to Willy Wonka's factory where they stumble into even more mischief. Eventually they find the wardrobe in the room and enter the wild world of Gnarnia (the g is silent, spelled so for legal reasons) where most of the movie takes place. Movies parodied include Nacho Libre, Xmen, Superman, Chronicles of Narnia, Pirates of the Caribbean, DaVinci Code, and a few more.. you lose track after a while.. The credits at the end are long because a couple times they break into song and dance yet again.. so beware if you are one of those people who flee out the door as soon as the credits roll, you might miss a chance to see more goofy stuff.I'd give it a lower rating for the cheesy acting and storyline, but I digress a little because I appreciate a good sarcastic apathetic make fun of comedy. If you are someone who hates series like Naked Gun, Scary Movie, Hot Shots, etc.. Then you are probably more inclined to hate this movie.",Epic Movie
545,alternating_echoes,Movie Review,5,26 January 2007,"An Epic Movie. Sounds like it has potential of making your Friday night off a successful one.I went to go watch this movie with the guys and at first I knew that this movie would come up with lame jokes but I was mistaken. At the beginning of the movie you are introduced to the characters which their fortune of being unfortunate accidents led them to one another. The gags they pulled are all 'Oh, yeah I get it' response. One of my friends laughed out of the rest of 4. This movie later gets funnier with the fighting of stunt doubles.I give this movie a 4/10 because it really lacks that HAHA comedy. If you enjoy parodies this movie only revolves around 1 parody. Naria. So, if you are into the Nacho Libre jokes, than this should be a blast!",Epic Movie
546,xoxbrandysays,What?,1,26 January 2007,OK so pretty much. I hated this movie. The beginning was funny. But after a bit the jokes just dragged on and got really old. I actually fell asleep in the theater. no lie. like i said the movie kept dragging on and on and on. i completely hated it. the music in it was good. and the actors that were chosen were perfect. but i don't see the humor in dragging jokes on and on the way they did. OK its from 2 of the 6 writers from scary movie right.? Well i think they shouldve had the other 4 help them. Cause we all know... Scary Movie was hilarious. This movie was nothing. It was 81 minutes of boring. I liked the idea of the chronicles of gnarnia thing but they shouldve followed the movie at least a little bit. Well thats all I'm saying. Goodbye.,Epic Movie

The only reason I gave this a 2 and not a 1 is that Kal Penn is almost worth buying the ticket for. In fact, you should buy the ticket for him, since I don't think even he would pay up to see it.",Epic Movie

I know this because I slept through 20 % of the movie which never happened before. Comedy is so childishly simple and you can get a feeling of disgust at its worst. a disgrace to the makers of the scary movies if u ask me. pathetically trying to make people laugh. waste of time n money going to such a movie. too many have been made fun of, practically no average movie patron would have seen it all to have the real feel of what these people re talking about. unwanted sexual references and the sequences sicking in their own aspect. the makers could have done better if they come and pump some laughing gas in the cinema halls if they wanted to get people to laugh. references made towards'harry potter', 'x men', 'pirates of the Caribbean' are a shame.",Epic Movie

The Scary Movies are great and Date Movie was nice but Epic Movie just sucked to the high heavens. The few funny parts no body understood and were soon forgotten. I had more fun watching previews for upcoming musicals. And nothing was relevant to Epic movies. I should have known, the Scary Movies are loosing their touch and Epic Movie was awful. The casting stunk. Willie Wonka was gross not funny. the man making out with the beaver was nasty and the ninja dude was creepy. Awful, awful, awful waste of participation. So, there see it if you want you'll be disappointed.",Epic Movie
550,hucketybuck,Horrible Epic Movie,1,29 January 2007,"The movie was very bad, it poked fun at religion, several sexual oriented and suggestive scenes. I do not recommend for any child to watch this movie the parents will be left to explain a lot to the children and the child will be exposed to a lot of suggestive, ignorant content. I do not recommend a person waste their money on this. I was expecting this movie to be hysterical and fun to see, but instead I was disappointed and bored. I only laughed at a few parts and I left the movie disappointed. The vulgar language was annoying and I heard other people who went to see the movie discuss how disappointed they were as well. I do not recommend this movie, it was a disappointment and not funny at all just boring, stupid and offensive. Fairwarning, I am going to tell you a spoiler so don't read beyond this point...The movie is basically The Chronicles of Narnia just redone to incorporate other movies such as the x-men, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Carebbean, the Divinchi Code and more. This was not funny and a complete disappointment and focused on sex and made fun of religion.",Epic Movie
551,pishposh567,A waste of time.,1,28 January 2007,"Wow. This movie was absolutely terrible. It was not very well thought out and wasn't even the slightest bit funny. I walked into the theater expecting it to be amazing but I was definitely misled. Don't get me wrong, I like stupid movies. Ones like ""Nacho Libre"" and ""Napoleon Dynamite"". Everyone I talked to hated those movies but I think that they are the greatest movies ever! I wish that they would have thought the plot line through, because it could have been a great and funny movie. It just seemed as if they just threw everything together in 2 minutes.

My daughter and I started out not like it, thought we'd wait it out to see if it improved, but ended up leaving. I have never done that to a movie. Their was no laughter in the crowd there...only silence. Some of it was just tacky, even for slapstick comedy. Tried to rely too much on ""shock"" instead of really relating to the movie being made fun of.Was a wasted of time and money. Nothing funny about it in my opinion. I love dumb, funny movie, but his one fell short. It appeared the writers were having a hard time coming up with any substance to their punch lines. This left their attempts at sattire flat.",Epic Movie

All of the crude jokes were hilarious and every part of it was funny. I rented it for my birthday party and all of my friends LOVED IT as well so I'm not alone. One of my favorite parts is the harry potter scene because it's so funny when Peter kills McGonagal, Dumbledore and Hagrid! Also when Mystique is changing herself for Peter and he says ""Mono-brow, Mono-brow kingy wants a mono-brow"" It's so funny!!!

Those little jokes were the only laughs I got through the whole thing...WHy did I give this movie an 8? CARMEN ELECTRA, even as an all blue X-men character, she was still the hottest thing I have ever seen.So go see the movie, Its not boring, and its not that funny, but I personally think it is still worth your time.This is my sole opinion, I went and saw it with a kid who probably thought it was one of the funnyest movies he has ever seen.

556,angelbaby_96,Epic Waste of Money,1,6 February 2007,"This movie is VERY, VERY, VERY horrible. I went to the movie after I watched the trailer. The TRAILER is funnier than the MOVIE because the trailer has almost every funny scene in it. From watching the trailer, you can predict what scenes are coming up in the movie. The movie was too cliché, and what you thought would be funny (e.g. Gnarnia) was NOT funny. I can't believe I had the will power to sit through two hours and watch the most horrible comedy in the world. This movie is a disgrace to all spoofs! People were leaving at the middle of the movie, and they weren't even paying attention to it. The theatre was FULL of people, who, by the end of the movie were gabbing on their cellphones and chatting with their friends.

I thought it would be funny, since I saw the preview before and it looked good. HOWEVER, I was very much disappointed, because this movie was not funny-- AT ALL. It was so horrible, that me and my friend just got up and left the theater in the middle of it. We couldn't stand another minute of it and it was such a waste of our money.No originality on the humor whatsoever. All they did was take beautiful classical works, humiliate it and make fun of it, and I didn't even laugh at all (except maybe at the scene with the Paris Hilton thing-- I guess that was sort of funny.) But be warned everyone-- DO NOT waste your time, energy and money on this movie. It was a complete disaster.",Epic Movie

Epic Movie is yet another victim of this trend.Granted, there's very little sophistication here. Some of the jokes are predictable, and continuity is (intentionally) the worst you'll see. That doesn't change the fact that Epic movie is an extremely funny film. It IS funny when medieval knights, Umpa Lumpas, pirates, and dwarfs dance.The laughs are cheap, but they're plentiful, and the pop culture references will one day date this movie, but really demonstrate a well-written script. See this with a group of friends, and I guarantee that you'll hear them quote lines from this movie for at least a week.

I actually enjoy bad movies as much as good ones because they are always good for a laugh; this one was sad, for the fact that it actually TRIED to be funny, whereas others are just bad on accident.To the creators of this film and all the other spoof movies that have come before it, STOP. Spare us please. Come up with something original. The only people who ever made good spoof movies are Mel Brooks and the guys behind the Naked Gun flicks. To the people who are reading this- save your money. It's painfully bad. It's squirm-in-your-chair bad.

We were laughing so hard, especially during the Willy Wonka part.

I wasn't really prepared for urine and vomit jokes. The 12 year olds giggled a lot. Language was mildish, but unnecessary.There were some funny bits, about five minutes total (love the portrayal of Jack Swallow(s), Fred Willard greatly icky as Also, Jennifer Coolidge awesome as the witch).

I just saw the movie, came back, and registered on IMDb to post about it. That's how bad this movie was. I'm a fair person and gave the movie a fair chance instead of walking out like I should have. The movie spoofs were drawn out way too far, most of the jokes weren't funny and half of them were irrelevant. Also, I saw the boom mic a total of 5 times throughout the movie; you'd think if it was meant to be seen, they would've drawn attention to it. Don't get me wrong, I chuckled maybe a grand total of 3 times, but that was being generous. Plenty of the people in the theater were laughing, but they were all children. If you're wondering whether or not to see this movie, wait a few months and pick it up out of the $1.99 DVD bin at Walmart.

Like the part in the beginning where they make Willy Wonka's chocolate into poop. Just the whole Willy Wonka part of the movie I thought was stupid. I think they could've done more with the Nacho Libre part, but thats just my thought. My favorite part is when they made fun of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". With Captain Jack Swallows.

It spoofs, Chronicles of Narnia, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, MTV Cribs, Snakes on a Plane, Pirates of the Caribbean, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle, American Pie, X-Men, Nacho Libre, The DiVinci Code, and several other films. Although there are some less than humorous parts of the film, for the most part it is a rather witty comedy/spoof.But it will only be funny to those who are familiar with the movies it spoofs.It very closely resembled the Scary/Date movies with their random and childish humor.I found it quite funny.",Epic Movie

I hate when movies have so much potential but are dumbed down for the rating and core audience they seek. In general this movie follows the settings of Chronicles of Narnia with other scenes from The DaVinci Code, to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Nacho Libre, X-Men, and with character appearances like Jack Sparrow (Jack Swallows), a team of Storm Troopers, Stiffler's mom (she is called that once) as the ""White Bitch, and so on..... You'd think with all of those ideas and areas to make fun of those movies, they would. But, they basically make the characters act stupid and put them in dumb situations, then out of nowhere throw in dance routines to recent rap music.

This script was obviously written in an afternoon and the director should publicly be flogged and be forced to watch this crapola over and over again until his head explodes.108 mins.

That's about the extent of the jokes in the movie.My friends and I had more fun making our own jokes in the theater about how bad it was... effectively making a better spoof of a movie, then Epic Movie actually did of any movie it tried to spoof.

Epic Movie failed horribly at any of this, and didn't even make me smile. I think my favorite part, and the best parody was the Queen's MySpace, only because I have a strong dislike for that website, and it captured so many pages I've seen far too well...So anyway, it's a large disappointment, as the last Scary Movies/as Date Movie has been; looked funny from the outside, terrible when actually seen. The writers could have done better than to string poorly done, over-used, unfunny jokes together for a...SHORT film, may I call it! Fair enough if you're making a long movie, I can see it a little hard to make every joke good. But this wasn't even a long movie - and not even one joke was funny. Sheesh.

There were a couple places where a joke here and there was somewhat funny, but the writers relentlessly turned what would have been a funny 5 second joke into a 10 minute running gag. Half way in, it just became so boring and repetitive I couldn't take it any longer.Kal Penn gave the least crappy performance, or maybe had the least horrible lines, but doesn't appear to play that big a part in the movie.

The movie had like no funny things in it and anything that was even close to remotely funny was shown in the trailers and by the time we saw the movie we already knew the jokes and it wasn't funny. besides the animation sucked and some of the jokes were not at all funny, some of them looked as if they were just thrown in there to make the movie longer, for example the borate thing at the end of the movie what was that?, another example is the superman thing with peter, and what is up with the chicken wings, thats just idiotic. i mean i can not believe that this movie was made by two of the people who made scary movie i mean those movies are cool but this one sucked.",Epic Movie

If your thinking about going out to watch this movie because you don't have anything better to do, than just have nothing better to do and save your money. Yet, on another hand go and watch this movie, because I want you to feel as miserable as I did, pain, suffering, wretchedness, feeling like kicking my own ass for wasting and hour of my already nothing to do life, crying out to my friend begging him to leave because he drove kind of miserable.

It was my goal to see it on opening night. My friends warned me that it would be stupid. I insisted that it would be hilarious (the commercials made it seem that way...). I dragged along my poor friend to see it with me on opening night. By the end of the movie, we were so horrified. We literally felt that about an hour of our life was ripped from our souls and left a gaping wound in the pit of our stomach...It was that bad!!!! We tried to joke about the movie...but we were so stricken with disbelief of how bad it actually was and we wanted to leave the theaters really badly. The beginning of the movie was pretty funny, but my expectations plummeted at the random rapping and sexual dance scenes. Throughout almost the whole movie, the audience was totally silent and by the end of it, you can hear people moaning on how they are thankful it's done and that they'll never see a movie like that in a very long time.

I was completely wrong when I made this judgment. I didn't even dare to see Little Man, but that was probably better. Throughout I wasn't laughing, nor was I looking. I really did almost fall asleep at this crap. The time taken to make this film was absolutely wasted and dead. toilet humor such as writing their names with urine and seeing a copy of willy - wonka taking some one's balls out is just a very strange sight. There was one part i did giggle at and that was when the copy of willy - wonka was dancing to fergilicous. Please, whomever you may be, a rich person or a hobo, i beg of you do not see Epic movie.

Well i must admit that some of the jokes did give my mates and i the occasional giggle, but the whole way through i just felt embarrassed to be seen watching this sort of crap! As a pretty average 15 year old, i found this film just stupid and silly, i paid a fiver of my money for this movie, and by the end, sitting at home with my cat, watching it assault its tail, was much more amusing! The actual quality of which this is filmed is appalling for a 21st century movie. I could have filmed this in my back garden for that matter! The stunts are so tacky and fake, and at one point it was blatantly obvious that they were using dummies to depict a fight scene. OK well maybe that was one of the jokes... well that was absolutely hilarious.They say that this film was made from two of the writers of scary movie. Well that explains a lot. Scary movie itself was a hilarious film, with so many laughs and hilarious gags, but not great, and with the writers who probably let down scary movie in the first place, they let down this.Thinking about it this movie had a chance, but that chance was ruined, my advice is to watch this only to see a really bad film!",Epic Movie

But there were absolutely no laughs. Not one. Not when laugh in the entiritey of this film. If you are reading this and have not seen this movie, make sure never to see it. I know the only way I'd ever see this movie again involves the chair from Clockwork Orange. Oh, and if you do by the off chance rent it, just fast forward the entire thing and make up your own jokes.

Some things however confused me rather than make me laugh, the harry potter scene and the snakes on a plane scene where not funny.I read that some people expected an Oscar winner after reading the title 'Epic Movie'. For heavens sake, it's in the name! It's not trying to show off, it's being SELF-IRONIC!Epic, read: Legendary. Legendary, read: SUPER DUPER GREAT!!!!11.That bit may have been to complex for some brains, but I at least expected a turkey feast when clicking on play.

588,bruddacag,It Sucked,1,1 February 2008,Watching the previews for this movie I was expecting to have some good laughs. After watching the actual movie however I was extremely disappointed. 95% of the movie I didn't even have a little chuckle or a laugh. I ended up slightly laughing to some of the pathetic vulgar stuff. Even the potty humor in this movie was really really bad. ( Worse potty humor ever!) I am a pretty big fan of potty humor and immature stuff ... but what this movie had to offer was sadly disappointing with what was presented. Aside from the humor there was many rap music type scenes where the characters were participating in a lamed down style of a MTV music video... many of these scenes were unnecessary or too much and far from entertaining. They were more or less not enjoyable and far too many like them. Now to the good parts of the movie ... trust me I'm trying hard to find em! Many movies were parodied and you will probably recognize most of them and there is an occasional scene where they throw characters from other movies in for the hell of it just to have them in the movie. I also liked the rap dance scene (only one i liked) where they were doing a Pirates of the Caribbean rap dance. It reminded me of Captain Dan the Hip Hop Pirate..I wonder if they were trying to parody that guy? Well folks there wasn't much more to this movie other than a waste of time and disappointment.,Epic Movie

After about 10 min, I was wishing I hadn't wasted the $2.00... It wasn't very funny, clever, or witty like they had hoped I think. The writers tried way too hard on this, with little result of any humor. But it was OK. Nothing more. Would I watch it again? Umm, no. But it did entertain me a tiny bit for a little while. So to everyone out there thinking this is going to be a fantastically hilarious movie, think again. Its wayyyy over top with the potty humor, ridiculous really.

Even so, It was nowhere near as good as Scary Movie, and is even below Date Movie. I rented the DVD, and even the special features fail to redeem this title. Such as the option where the entire movie is replayed with farting and belching sounds dubbed over it.While I'm generally into random comedy, I can easily say this is pretty dull, with the exception of a few jokes. Every joke seemed forced, out of place, or completely unnecessary. And rather than making fun of the movies they parody, they simply rewrite bits of them with dumbed down characters.I could have seen this being a very funny movie, had the directors known what they were doing...I've heard that there is a sequel in the works... if this is true, I hope that it is better than this.

592,sparkster-sanjulo,Warning: watching this movie may result in permanent brain damage.,1,3 July 2007,"Sparkster (Yea the Rocket Knight) here with a few words on this... ANNOYING.. Random collaboration of mass horrors. - For a long time I've been getting random questions, one day one of the questions was ""Hey Sparky I wanna make a random movie, but I want it to be best but I don't know where to start how I can make it not be like a steamy pile of poop??"" - And my answer is... As much as it PAINS me to say it.. Watch this. - WHY you ask? - Because... It gives you a good clue in on WHAT NOT TO DO when trying to make a random collaboration of events. - OK sure, some of the plot holes where hilarious, I love plot holes, BUT the problem lies in the repetition of them, plot holes are really hard to get right, the timing has to be at least decently good and the plot-hole absolutely ridiculous but different from the previous ones. It looked like they got desperate or something and decided to throw a bunch of random crap in for the sake of throwing it in. - Another problem is the MUSIC!!! Oh gods!!! Downright annoying, way to much rap!! It's not even funny rap it's downright plain old drum-mashing' person-blabbing' on top kind of rap. Of all the annoying music I've heard the ones in this movie takes the cake. If you love rap it's great but if you don't it'll be a torturous crawl. - What REALLY lets this one down is the enormous amount of pop-culture references.. Waaaaay to much!! I betcha if they left out the pop-culture references and filled them in with something else the overall greatness of this movie would skyrocket. - Also, this movie isn't MY idea of a good quality PG-13 movie, AT ALL, there is A lot of suggestive and inappropriate stuff. It should have been rated higher. - The best jokes where the simple slap-stick humor ones, which there wasn't very many of, most of them are pop-culture reference jokes (It's so bad it needs a second complaint round) that you pretty much have to know exactly what their referencing for them to be funny, of course here's another problem, a lot of people, myself included, don't pay attention to pop-culture at all, so are left thinking ""Well that was dumb"". - It seems to me that this was a decent attempt at random craziness, but it wasn't ironed out NEAR LONG ENOUGH and top of that the base was unstable anyway. - Making random crap like this is like tailoring a rug together from scratch, every thread and string must be picked carefully and strung well, if this movie was a rug it'd look like a totally rushed piece of cloth with strings of all different sizes sticking out everywhere that are in every color and pattern imaginable. - Oh yea, and it'll have a cardboard cut-out of a smiley face glued on to it. - What I'm trying to say is it was rushed, not well thought out and way to stupid!! I usually like stupid movies, but all the stupid ones I like would, on rating of 1 to 10, rate at about 9 or 10, this one breaks the scale by rating at the amazing number of infinite. (So in other words it's *epically* stupid) - Is that 'infinite' even a number? Don't think so but whatever, close enough. - So this WAS inspiring to me, no, not in the way you might be thinking!! - It inspires me to avoid the mistakes made here and this is among ultimate examples of 'lame', so, if you ever wanted to make the world's most awesome random movie, study this sucker (And others like it) to the letter and avoid those 'letters' and chances are, your movie will be great. - Anyhow, after barely managing to survive this torture all I can say is my IQ must have dropped by 99% for at least a couple of days, with at least 5% of the damage being permanent. - It's *that* bad.",Epic Movie

Let me start by saying that I was forced by my nut case of an ex-girlfriend to see this waste of film. It amazes me that movies like this piece of garbage get more recognition than actual movies like City of God and Amorres Perros. What drives me insane is that people were actually retarded enough to PAY MONEY and waste time watching this 1 hour and 8 minute long piece of crap which could have been spent more productively staring at a blank wall or slamming your hand with a car door.Seriously to know that this movie was #1 in the box office and raked 19 MILLION dollars opening weekend made me die inside and made me lose hope in America.

To watch this movie is to encourage those who wrote it and frankly anyone associated with this movie should go and find themselves another job because script writing and comedy definitely isn't it. I really did try hard to like it as I encouraged a friend to watch it with me on Sky Movies but the movie just totally and utterly fails to deliver even one laugh. In the end we stuck out about 30 minutes and then gave up.

For one, it doesn't take ""guts"" to do what Epic Movie does; equally shoddy films have been doing it for ages. Also, the word parody should be used very loosely when describing Epic Movie.

I mean, what the hell is it??? Luckily, I didn't buy it, my boyfriend lent it to me for me and my mum & brother to watch, and after being brought up on films like Airplane!, The Monty Python films and Blazing Saddles, this made me lose all faith in comedy...what's happened? Why was this even allowed to be made? We were just sat there watching it expecting much more, and I was very disappointed with the utter rubbish I witnessed. My brother said, after 20 minutes 'I'm gonna go now, I don't like this much' and my mum and I said 'nor me ..it's just not funny at all'. I really just didn't understand what was supposed to be so 'epic' about it...unnecessary rapping and meaningless, unfunny scenes...I just didn't see the point. Repetition IS NOT FUNNY...maybe for anyone under the age of 9, but no. This is a Cert15. There is no structure to it at all, and it's painfully predictable. Spoofs are supposed to be FUNNY, comical parodies of films, for the retarded people who wrote this. And I can't believe it had a budget of $20 millionMonty Python's 'And Now For Something Completely Different' had a budget of £80,000 (about $100,000) and that's one of the funniest films I've ever seen, ad quite frankly, that sickens and infuriates me. Why the hell were they allowed that much to produce what is easily the lowest of all lows where movies are concerned? It's an insult to comedy. I wouldn't recommend this film to ANYONE. Do yourself a favour- for the love of God don't watch this film. You'll be saving yourself from a complete waste of time. So very disappointing... For god's sake...most films that are utter crap tend to be funny because they are crap, but this just takes the biscuit...pity you can't vote minus stars on here, but for the record i give this pathetic excuse for a film minus infinity out of ten.

It was made by the some of the people who made Scary Movie and Date Movie, so I expected some of the same actors to play in it from Date Movie as Scary Movie does. Some people says they were offended by some parts of it, bottom line, if you are easily offended by what you are, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!

602,npe34,Don't see this movie.,2,26 February 2007,"There is a difference between a parody and an imitation. Parodies are to imitate (a composition, author, etc.) for purposes of ridicule or satire (dictionary.com). Imitations are to make a copy of; reproduce closely (dictionary.com).All-be-it mostly unfunny, Saturday Night Live is still best at doing satirical parodies. They know how to take the situational or character flaws of a celebrity or news figure and exploit them to the point of enjoyment. (There are many gems coming out of the SNL camp, like new heroes characters and Andy Samburg's digital shorts).An imitation will use an original as a template, or if extremely lazy completely just rip off the source material. Since we're contrasting imitations with parodies, imitations in this case usually put a twist to the source. For example, Mr. Tumnus in Epic Movie is played by the actor who brought life to Nacho Libre's tag partner/ Napoleon Dynamyte's friend Pedro. In order to make the character funny, they just made him look really weird, essentially he played the exact same character of Mr. Tumnus in Narnia- the first time.Epic movie also put a FULL 5 minute imitation of MTV cribs. Yes their observations on rappers and scarface were true, but it was funny the first 4 years of my life I saw it on SNL, Mad TV, any other show that actually takes itself seriously in the form of Cribs.Epic movie also put a FULL 4 minute imitation of the Chronicles of Narnia song that came out --( notice my imitation of paragraphs)------ oh I don't know, over 1 year ago? The Chronic-What-cles of Narnia is technically a comedic parody in itself: it parodies hard rap and nerds that really want to see an epic movie like Narnia. RULE: Never Ever Make A Parody of a Parody. It was virtually the same beat, with a new movie title put in.Oh and if you make an Epic Movie --- make sure all the movies IMITATED are Epic. I don't think Talledega Nights is considered epic, nor was it a blockbuster. Neighter was Borat, or Nacho Libre. --- And Paris Hilton isn't epic.",Epic Movie

605,frogs98,Very sad,1,17 April 2008,"Too bad there is no way to rate this zero stars. I rented this hoping for a mindless comedy that I could just watch, laugh at, and not have to think about. I got the last one of those. Really, this was a really bad re-make (not spoof....a re-make) of Narnia. Filled with excessive belches and farts that seemed to be added in post-production, because the studio was desperately trying to make the movie funny. That was my impression. In any case, those sound effects (the first time it got a chuckle, after that they were just annoying) ruined any potential- if there was any- of the script. I kept waiting for the whole movie to just end. It is really so sad that this sort of film can be produced today, and I can't imagine people even saw it in the theaters. I was also really embarrassed for all of the actors in here; seems they were given the script the morning they came onto the set and told to do their part and get out. Just an awful and depressing movie. Very sad.",Epic Movie
606,kaurico,The horror...the horror.,1,29 January 2009,Epic Movie cannot be commented on or reviewed in the traditional sense as there really is no plot to consider.Four friends go to some place where they get moved around sets resembling movies you may or may not have seen. I believe that's the general gist of what happens. I was too busy trying to tear my eyes out to really watch. I think I made it to the scene where Crispin Glover started break dancing before I blacked out completely only to be woken by the screaming of my cat.After putting the cat down (I couldn't let it suffer) I resolved to finish the movie in the same way I was determined to survive those terrible years at the Hanoi Hilton. To my surprise the ending credits did not usher in Armageddon and since burning (it took several attempts) the DVD and scattering the ashes the migraines and nightmares have ceased entirely. I hope this works for you.Epic movie is by far the worst parody movie ever made. I can't think of another attempt at comedy as insipid as this. Period. It's as bad an attempt at parody as George W Bush's attempt at a presidency was. Please stay away. Go watch Airplane instead. You'll feel better about yourself in the morning.,Epic Movie

I watched it on DVD because I have a preference for trash-movies and I was curious to watch this since it was in the ""Bottom 100"" list of the worst films ever. Although it is bad, I must say that I saw a lot of films which are much worse than this one (e.g. ""The silence of the Hams""). The idea of making a ""funny"" movie which contains no plot and simply consists of a sequence of parodies of other popular movies is really not fancy.

In the end, it turns out that the movie makes no sense whatsoever. It also includes very immature ""jokes"" where someone gets hurt, such as getting hit by a car. If anyone should enjoy these movies, it should not be any teenager/adult.

Plenty of gay jokes in these movies. I cannot believe that all the kids, seventh graders, all laughed at every joke. It was horrible. Even worse, now they think 'epic' means 'a funny movie'.

614,ragefast-2,"The pain, the pain!",1,6 July 2009,"OK, I just saw this crap on German TV. I expected a mindless and moderately funny comedy, kind of perfect after a hard days work.Unfortunately, this movie isn't even unintentionally funny. You can't even laugh about how bad it is, because the repetitive 'gags', the randomly stuck together scenes and the dialogues are just plain dull. Boring. I laughed exactly four times throughout the whole movie, which is a rather bad quote for a comedy.The main problem is that although the imitations of the original movies are rather well executed and the famous-actor-look-alikes really look similar to their counterparts, the directors somehow confused simple references to famous movies with being funny. Their interpretation of a gag consists mainly of people/animals getting hit, preferably in the crotch. Gets pretty dull after the, erm, 20th time? In conclusion, the movie is so boring it's not even worth watching it for making fun of it. Doesn't work, just a wast of time. Really.PS: As this movie was a box-office success (!), expect more of this crap in near future. Which probably will become another success due to a huge marketing campaign...

615,alex-mclellan,Epic Movie,3,29 July 2009,This film brings nothing new to spoof films all that it shows is that there are no young actors out there who can do comedy. This film shows that veteran comedy actors Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard are the only people who bring anything to this film. The films lack of a spoofing genre is ridiculous. The directors have decided they can spoof anything around but all spoof films need a genre other than spoof. The spoof of Punk'd and Cribs is pointless and bring nothing to the film as well as spoofing Lord of the Rings and other films for no reason other than to show characters is just plain lazy film-making. Despite the film's gross-out and stupid humour there are a small amount of bright sparks.

In my opinion 'Epic movie' isn't funny at all, it's very mildly entertaining, which is a generous statement. The film has no good qualities at all, badly written, stupid plot; no offence to the actors, but the acting was terrible, in their defence this is most likely how the film makers intended them to act, which clearly is an even bigger insult to the film. After I had seen the film I honestly thought 'what a waste of a couple of hours!' For a person who is passionate about films it made me angry, that this film was put on television. Or even that it was made in the first place. Why did they spend so much money on all the costumes, when they didn't bother to put the effort into the script?

618,edstennett,"Woeful attempt at humour, lacking any substance or flair, the film is on a world of it's own",2,17 January 2010,"To me, you can always tell from the start if a film is worth watching or not. In my mind, if the films slogan is 'We know it's big. We measured', you can almost certainly conclude that its probably a film to miss. I was right. Anyone above the age of 14 can come to an instant deduction that it is a terrible film. The 'plot' jumps around, following a group of high school children, who embark on a supposedly epic quest, making parodies of various other films along the way. However, after the first 20 minutes or so, it becomes all to clear that the film relies heavily on the frequent use of crude toilet humour, and persistent references to feces. I am all to sure that a pack of 12 year olds will think that the height of all wit has been reached in this film, and would have spent majority of the time watching the film, rolling on the floor, giggling away at the references to the male genitalia, and laughing out loud at the abundance of slapstick humour that features throughout. Luckily, the people who will 'love' this film, (children aged 8-12) are those that feel you are incapable of stringing an amusing sentence together, without unleashing one of their newly discovered swear words, or making some sort vulgar reference to fart jokes. It makes me somewhat scared that if the latest crop of 8-12 year olds are so captivated by swearing and any form of slapstick and toilet humour, they fail to think of anything original and funny themselves. Is that really what the future holds for comedy? All jokes making some sort of allusion to excrement. I think you can probably guess by the 'two star' rating that this is a film to miss. It, I know, it is a generous rating, but, though ashamed to admit it, I did laugh twice, partially fulfilling it's role as a 'comedy'. At least now 'HMV' will know which genre to place it under, making the film all to easy to find for those 12 year olds, so eager to grasp hold a copy of possibly the worst film of the year.

This movie is intended for the 13-21 age range, or anyone who doesn't have his or her genitals caught in a vice of pessimism and can just relax and say ""Haha, this is one crazy movie."" Ranting aside, the adolescent antics in the opening scenes (which I won't reveal) set the mood for the entire movie, preparing the audience for a ridiculous journey of epic proportions. Cheesy, I know. However, the film maintains this level of teenage slapstick very consistently, portraying an almost Mad TV-esquire production. A decent job is done by the lead characters, with each persona more irreverent and comically oblivious than the last.I found the parody involved, at times, simultaneously mindless and brilliant. The sheer inanity of the connections truly exposes the adolescence of the writers, and the audience, if not overly obsessed with perfection in film, SHOULD take this nonsense for all it's worth. It takes a certain humor to appreciate parody, no matter how high-brow it may be; apparently, this humor is lost on today's society, where we believe that only the likes of SNL can spoof current culture.Admittedly, this is quite a non-intellectual film.

Willy and Captain Jack along with a few others were well depicted and the characters could have done so much more for the movie had they not burst into irritating songs and pelvic thrusting dance moves.

It's not good enough to stand on its own, and it's nor bad enough to get a laugh out of. If I could go back in time and warn my younger self about how bad this 'film' was, I'd absolutely do it.

651,mgandrews,"Well Produced, Terribly Written.",3,3 October 2007,"There have been mixed comments about this movie. Some people say it is good, others say it is simply terrible. I decided I'd ignore both arguments and see the movie for myself. I now tend to agree with those who think it's simply terrible; here's why: ""Epic Movie"" is a bit like Scary Movie, except it was obviously put together without very much thought and very little attention to the overall storyline. The characters are poor and undeveloped, the storyline unstructured, and the overall atmosphere of the movie is ""unfinished."" It is meant to be a parody of other 'recent' movies, which it does do, but not in an overly successful way. The beginning sequence, a parody of ""The Da Vinci Code"", is mildly entertaining, and could be seen as the ""highlight"" of the film. Other films are also parodied, including ""Harry Potter"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and, of course, ""Narnia."" Personally, I felt the parody of Narnia was overdone, and it was an extremely expensive film to choose as the main ""plot."" The use of rap music in ""Epic Movie"" was truly horrible, and very overdone. I believe two ""rap parodies"" was far too many (none would have been much better), and the parodies seemed to go on and on and never end.The ending was also ridiculous and non-creative, but by then I was expecting it.Apart from the terrible storyline and poor humor, the actors were good, and so were the special effects. It's just a shame a good movie couldn't have been produced with the $20 million budget this movie had. It seemed that thousands of dollars were spent on the stupidest little jokes, that didn't even generate a chuckle. I believe that with a better, more structured script, this movie would have been more successful.",Epic Movie

There were some scenes that we did not need to see. I know it was meant to be funny, but the stunt doubles that were exposed in the fight scenes, should have been hidden. It wasn't really working there.How this movie got a rating of PG-13 is beyond me. For those parents that take their young children to see PG-13 movies, this is NOT the movie to take them to.

Jackson look-alike said was ""I'm sick of these god-damn snakes on this god-damn plane"" and he said that about 4 times before the spoof thankfully ended.There was also small spoofs of Superman Returns, Tallageda Knights, James Bond, Star Wars, Click etc. But those lasted either a minute of a few seconds. Also they do make fun of Kanye West, Ashton Kutcher, P. Diddy and Mission Impossible.They made of Harold and Kumar: Go to White Castle a lot in this movie, which was really funny because of Kal Penn even allowing them to do so.The movie does have a lot of swear words, a couple s***'s and one f-bomb and a bunch more but that was about it.This movie did have some moments, but unfortunately, not enough to prove me wrong.I give this movie 4 stars/10 stars.",Epic Movie

I make videos on you tube (greatestband) and I can think of better jokes for this then they could. Plus one of the worst things about it was people getting hurt over and over again.

I ended up slightly laughing to some of the pathetic vulgar stuff. Even the potty humor in this movie was really really bad. ( Worse potty humor ever!) I am a pretty big fan of potty humor and immature stuff ... but what this movie had to offer was sadly disappointing with what was presented. Aside from the humor there was many rap music type scenes where the characters were participating in a lamed down style of a MTV music video... many of these scenes were unnecessary or too much and far from entertaining. They were more or less not enjoyable and far too many like them. Now to the good parts of the movie ... trust me I'm trying hard to find em! Many movies were parodied and you will probably recognize most of them and there is an occasional scene where they throw characters from other movies in for the hell of it just to have them in the movie. I also liked the rap dance scene (only one i liked) where they were doing a Pirates of the Caribbean rap dance.

They forget not every movie is made to win an Oscar..This movie is supposed to be stupid in a way...If you go into that theater ready to laugh and have a good time and with a good mindset...You will most likely love this film....Take my advice and get out there and see this movie...Laugh and enjoy yourself, thats what this movie is for....GO SEE EPIC MOVIE!!!!",Epic Movie
675,jsanford-67649,So dumb that you need add it to your collection,6,9 September 2018,"Its a 6 as long as you percieve it as a bunch of B Rated actors being kidnapped at gunpoint, tossed onto the stage and told them to remember this script and hope for the best.
Of course a couple of these actors got real rolls later on its just super entertaining to see them do this movie as if they wanted to do this while on some substanceThe plot itself was all over the place let alone no a
Actual plot some pretty disturbing scenes, cheesy stereotypes, terrible insults,couple catchy sing a longs and no haooy ending. I like to think of this movie as an on screen fail and you simply get to watch a movie thats the opposite of what hollywood supposed to achieve. It will fill a place in my heart along with the starving games,fast five, young frankstein(which was actually well done)",Epic Movie
676,chalkoutline007,An Epic failure,1,29 January 2007,"This movie is awful, its a little less than two hours - that I will never have back in my life - a complete waste of time. Its not funny at all- the scripts tries too hard to get a laugh - any type of comedic moment feels forced. I didn't really want to see this movie but some friends did so i went along, I thought well at least it should make me laugh. I did not laugh once. I keep trying to find moments to laugh at, but everything was so over done and unbelievable that I could not find anything funny, I could only roll my eyes in disappointment. The entire theatre seemed to feel the same way, I only heard a couple of chuckles throughout the movie, and I am not even sure it was the movie they were laughing at. It seemed people were whispering about the movie - and then I heard a few chuckles. Don't waste your time by buying a ticket or by renting it when it comes out. An Epic failure. :/",Epic Movie
677,cateyes_3,"Oh jeez, not another one!",2,28 January 2008,"This movie is so lousy, but I can't say I'm surprised. I'm all for punning movies, as long as it's done in a way that's actually FUNNY. Unfortunately, with movies like ""Epic Movie,"" ""Date Movie,"" or Scary Movie 1, 2, 3, X"" that's never the case. Their jokes are either overdone, disgusting, or incredibly stupid; basically, anything BUT funny, which is pretty sad considering this is supposed to be a comedy. I really can't imagine why anyone would find those jokes funny-- the entire Willy Wonka segment is simply sickening, 3/4 of the orphan introductions are stupid rather than funny, and most of the parodies are overdone and incredibly immature. There are about four humorous scenes in this movie, and only one made me laugh out loud. That's pretty pathetic.",Epic Movie
678,demons_of_sum41,Simply Genius *cough*,1,18 March 2007,"Well where to start? I was pretty excited when I entered the theater with a large cup of pop corn. The place was full, literally. Every seat was taken... Once the film started rolling, I understood what I was going to sit through. Crude humor that was only funny to children 11<, primitive sex jokes, talentless and unclever spoofing... bleh, just bleh. Epic Movie is truly the most idiotic film since its ""brother from another mother"" Not Another Teen Movie and even there, the spoofs looks much more clever. I really can't imagine how much money the producers of this pile of garbage had to give the cinemas to show this. I wouldn't advise watching this even to the most immaturest of folk. Just don't waste that hour (yes, the movie is only an hour long) of your life on something like this. I'd suggest watching T4XI or even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles compared to this. It's not even worth a rental.",Epic Movie

680,joeyspidey,Don't listen to them,10,29 January 2007,"Forget what everyone else says, this movie was great. I laughed every 10 seconds and it was like watching Scary Movie 5, except without scary movie parodies. The parodies are creative and hilarious, and this movie deserves a 10, if you haven't seen it, see it. Give it a chance, I thought it was a great movie and you should defiantly see it!!!! Excellent use of ""Fergielicious"" in the movie as well. Great jokes along the way, and I can't watch Chronicles of Narnia without cracking up. I went into this movie as a last second thing to do on a Friday night, and I thought it would suck. But I was pleasantly surprised. I'll be using Epic Movie terms for a long time now. Long live Jack Swallows!!!!!!!!",Epic Movie
