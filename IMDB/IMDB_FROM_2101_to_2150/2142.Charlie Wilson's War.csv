0,TheLittleSongbird,"Compelling, clever and entertaining",8,27 October 2010,"Charlie Wilson's War is a very good film in my opinion, that is compelling, clever and entertaining. I would have liked it to have been a mite longer and any sense that Wilson was gratifying his own ego is downplayed so some events feel rather glossed over. However, it is beautifully shot, with good direction and a smart and sassy script. It also goes at a good pace and is very compelling and clever so the film never/rarely feels boring. The acting is very good, Tom Hanks delves into the role of a booze hound and womaniser yet is still somewhat likable while Julia Roberts is appropriately sharp-tongued and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann is simply brilliant as the gruff CIA agent. The rest of the supporting cast(Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Om Puri and Ned Beatty) are also impressive. In conclusion, a worthwhile film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Charlie Wilson's War
1,bkoganbing,A Thought Provoking Film,9,28 December 2007,"Though the importance of Representative Charles Wilson, Democrat from Texas who served from 1973 to 1997 in Congress, in the fall of the Russian puppet regime in Afghanistan maybe in exaggerated in George Crile's book and in this film, Charlie Wilson's War provides an insight into Washington politics that you won't get from the talking heads of the various news networks.I liked Charlie Wilson, or at least the way Tom Hanks plays him. A politician who doesn't take himself to terribly serious who likes his fun and frolic, but also has some deep concerns about the United States of America and its position in the world. It fell to him because of some key committee assignments to be able to give the Central Intelligence Agency the appropriations necessary to defeat the Russians in Afghanistan which eventually toppled the Soviet Union itself. A feat that conservative Republicans like to assign exclusively to their hero, Ronald Reagan. Wilson and Clarence Long, played by Ned Beatty, belong to that vanishing breed of conservative to moderate Democrats who as they leave, their places are taken by Republicans. The only group growing extinct faster than them are the liberal Republicans. We're a bitterly partisan nation now and no one party or one individual is responsible for it. Note how Wilson is being investigated by a certain U.S. Attorney named Rudolph Giuliani back in the day. Don't think the object there wasn't partly to open that seat up for the GOP.In our story Wilson becomes interested and it's more than the interest of a politician currying for votes of the plight of the Afghans. They just need the weaponry and the know how. Sparking his interest is Texas society leader, political power broker, and former beauty queen Julia Roberts. It's the best part Julia's had since Erin Brockovich.But when he's on the screen Philip Seymour Hoffman blows everyone else out of the water. Hoffman is a career Central Intelligence Agency official who seems to have encountered the glass ceiling in his career there. It's a feeling I know well from my former job, I'd love to have done what Hoffman did to his superior when we first meet him in the film.Hoffman and Hanks become an unbeatable team, Hanks handling the Congress and Hoffman the inside politics of the CIA. They make it happen for the Afghans.Those who criticize the film miss the whole point. We left the Afghans free, but in a devastated country. That was the whole point of that scene where Wilson is vainly trying to get decent appropriations for rebuilding Afghanistan's infrastructure. Because policy makers put Afghanistan on the back-burner the vacuum created was filled by the Taliban with terrible results.Also listen to Hoffman's character's zen like analysis as to what the future could hold as a result of their work. History is full of surprises, mostly unpleasant.I think a couple of Oscars could be in the future for Charlie Wilson's War. It's a thought provoking film that should not be missed.",Charlie Wilson's War
2,SnoopyStyle,not funny enough as satire nor hard-hitting enough as realism,6,29 May 2015,"Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is celebrated by the clandestine services. The movies flashbacks to the early 1980s. Playboy Texas minor congressman Charlie Wilson gets interested in the struggles of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan. Bonnie Bach (Amy Adams) is his executive assistant. He is pushed by his wealthy supporter Houston socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and assisted by maverick CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman).Tom Hanks is fine but I wish he is acting bigger and brasher. Julia Roberts is not nearly acting big enough for a Texas socialite. The hair is big but she's not wild enough. They are playing it a bit too safe for a satire. The thing is that I never bought into its realism either. PSH ups the fun factor with his acting. The movie is not jokey enough to be funny. Neither is it harsh enough. Considering 9/11 at the top of every audience's mindset, it could have hit a lot harder. It's somewhere in the lumpy middle. The film leaves only a couple of scenes for the post-Soviet Afghanistan. That could be a compelling switch in his character but it gets short-changed.",Charlie Wilson's War
3,Hitchcoc,I Have No Problem Believing It,8,2 January 2010,"I don't know if all the events are completely accurate. There are analysts out there that can sort that out. Yes, Charlie Wilson is an inept, womanizing, careless man, but he is changed. We did support the people of Afghanistan and we did leave and the Soviets were torn apart. Of course, you wouldn't want the U.S. to come out in a bad light. I don't see the conclusion of this as any sort of victory. Philip Seymour-Hoffmann's character knows this. And yes, most of sit smugly around, patting ourselves on the back while young men and women go out and get themselves blown up as windbag politicians ignore the realities of war. It's been going on for 10,000 years. It' not even an indictment of the U. S.; it's an indictment of the baser instincts of people in power. I think the empty feeling I got after seeing this tells it all. I didn't admire Charlie Wilson, nor do I see him as a hero. He just found a way to kill a different group of people through the use of taxpayer money. Do we ever remember that those are human beings that are being killed and dismembered?",Charlie Wilson's War
4,Prismark10,One invader to another,5,7 May 2016,"The subtext of this film is that Charlie Wilson's War is still raging in Afghanistan but the USA has replaced the Soviets because they allowed a vacuum to develop in a country after the the Soviet withdrawal where the Taliban amongst other groups stepped in.Writer Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols should have gone for dark, subversive satire with Charlie Wilson, a Democrat congressman from Texas known for some good time partying who somehow built an alliance that led to a covert military campaign to arm the Mujahideen in 1980s Afghanistan and repel the Soviet invaders.What we get is a strained, anaemic film with broad and uneven comedy that barely hits any targets and just about carried by the charm of its star, Tom Hanks helped by Philip Seymour Hoffman's blue collar, truculent CIA operative with Julia Roberts as a wealthy socialite and anti commie Texan with an array of international connections that helps Wilson.Maybe current events in the Middle East at the time this film was made meant that it had to pull its punches and come across as wishy washy.",Charlie Wilson's War
5,classicsoncall,"""Without Charlie, history would be hugely and sadly different.""",8,24 December 2012,"If this weren't based on actual events and a period of U.S. history, I don't think anyone could have made it up. Seriously, how do you go from a mere one million dollar appropriation to fund an action in Afghanistan against the Soviets, and have it grow into a billion dollar enterprise over a span of time? It's always easier to quibble over lesser amounts of money than huge sums because smaller numbers are easier to understand. Billions (now trillions) just don't seem to mean anything anymore.Then there's the question of how a seemingly under the radar politician could wield so much power in the first place. There's just such a randomness to how the film's events turned out that it's somewhat incomprehensible. It wasn't really explained what socialite Joanne Herring's (Julia Roberts) fascination with the people of Afghanistan was all about, other than a conservative backer's insistence that the Russkies be put in their place and out of the picture. You have to wonder what would have ever happened and what the status of the Middle East would be today if these characters hadn't crossed paths in the most coincidental of ways.Hanks and Roberts are OK for what the script calls for, but like many others I found Philip Seymour Hoffman to be the glue that holds this thing together. He gets things started very quickly by adding new meaning to the phrase, 'take this job and shove it'. The rest as they say, can be found in the history books.",Charlie Wilson's War
6,lee_eisenberg,Not even while they were filming it did they realize how relevant it would be!,8,3 January 2008,"As I understand it, Charlie Wilson is in real life a slimier character than the movie makes him out to be. But there's no denying that Tom Hanks does a great job with the role of the Texas congressman who encouraged arms sales to the Afghan mujahideen, which of course indirectly led to the September 11 attacks.But there's even more. While most of the movie is a rather smooth ride, there were two scenes that made me feel like I'd just gotten slapped. Wilson meets with Pakistan's Pres. Zia ul-Haq (Om Puri); it was Zia ul-Haq who executed Benazir Bhutto's father...and I saw this just a few days after Benazir Bhutto's assassination! Moreover, one of the people involved in the indictment against Wilson was a young lawyer named...Rudolph Giuliani! Therefore, Wilson's quote at the end (""...we'll see how things turn out..."") takes on even more significance! Anyway, the movie itself also shows how the people wheeling and dealing in these circles basically have no ethics. To hide US weapons sales to the Afghans, Wilson had to hire an Israeli agent to acquire Soviet arms from Egypt. Seriously, these people will do anything to benefit themselves and their cronies. Philip Seymour Hoffman is really the best character, as a CIA agent (you gotta admire the spunk of someone who does what he does in his first scene).Overall, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is certainly one that I recommend. Mike Nichols accomplished another good one. Also starring Julia Roberts, Amy Adams and Ned Beatty.",Charlie Wilson's War
7,jboothmillard,Charlie Wilson's War,6,19 September 2010,"I saw the leading male star of this film promoting it on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, and I am a big fan of his, so I was going to watch it pretty much regardless, from director Mike Nichols (The Graduate, Closer). Basically, set at the beginning of the 1980's, U.S. Congressman Charlie Wilson (Golden Globe nominated Tom Hanks) from Texas is a womanising representative. The people of Afghanistan are suffering in the brutal Soviet occupation, Charlie learns this from his major conservative supporter Joanne Herring (Golden Globe nominated Julia Roberts). Charlie is determined to help the political and war efforts with the Afghan Mujahideen, with some help from maverick and easily aggravated CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Philip Seymour Hoffman). Raising millions of dollars, the idea is fro Charlie to supply the Mujahideen with weapons and support to defeat the Soviet Union, but in doing this there will be big consequences besides many lives lost. Also starring Amy Adams as Bonnie Bach, Emily Blunt as Jane Liddle, Ken Stott as Zvi, The Parole Officer's Om Puri as President Zia, Ned Beatty as Doc Long and Ugly Betty's Daniel Eric Gold as Donnelly. I can agree with the critics Hanks as a womanising political leader doesn't make his likability fade, Roberts does get her moments as the sharp-tongued socialite, and Hoffman is indeed great as the gruff CIA agent. I may not have understood everything going on, but I had a tiny giggle or two, and I just liked seeing an officer of only female workers, some news footage and explosions from bazookas and stuff, so it's not a bad biographical comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy and Best Screenplay. Good!",Charlie Wilson's War
8,rmax304823,Dumbed Down History Lesson.,2,29 November 2008,"Nichols and Sorkin are smart enough to know that geopolitics is a dynamic system, like pond scum, with each perturbation disturbing the surface and having a ripple effect and not-quite-predictable consequences. Instead, the movie gives us a view of the Soviet/Afghan war that resembles an old-fashioned Western. The world is divided categorically into good and evil.Everything complicated about the confrontation in the Middle East is left out. The Soviet Union shoots down helpless civilians from helicopters and drops booby-trapped baby toys? Absolutely nothing is said about the reasons for the USSR's presence in Afghanistan to begin with. (The country borders the Soviet Union.) Except for a few hints at the very end, we are told nothing of the consequences of our covert intervention. The joy of the American public at the Soviet Union's defeat was mostly a celebration of our having, in the phrase of the day, ""turned Afghanistan into Russia's Vietnam."" And it's given to us as a triumph of Julia Roberts' familiar Texas anti-communism and Charlie Wilson's momentary binge of humanitarianism.The irony of our now having to fight the very people we went to such trouble to inspire and arm would have been a much more challenging film -- a more realistic one, and a much needed obiter dictum. Nobody watching this movie and taking it as Truth is going to learn much from it except that, as usual, Americans are good (and ingenious too) and the enemy (whoever it may be at any particular moment) has earned his own execution.As a film -- as a succession of images and spoken words by performers -- it's not badly done, though I enjoyed Nichols' ""Primary Colors"" more. But Nichols is a seasoned and talented director and he doesn't step wrong. He layers in quite a bit of low-key and offhanded humor, rendering the characters deceptively human. The movie tells the story through the character of Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks), who is supposed to be an endearing character because he drinks a lot and sits naked with some babes in a hot tub. That's not good enough. He'd be far more admirable if, in addition, he knew what the hell he was doing, if he showed the foresight of a newbie chess player. Julia Roberts is hard to recognize at first. It's been years since she's appeared on screen and with her grooming and make up, she looks a lot like the kind of tony, adulterous wife she's supposed to be. Her performance is adequate though. The fustian dialog has little sparkle so neither she nor anyone else can do much with it, with the exception of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who gets to curse a lot between tirades.I fear, though, that what Nichols and Sorkin are trying to tell us is that (gasp) some congressmen snort coke and like women with big knockers. But that in the heart of each there lurks the seed of simple patriotism. And I do mean ""simple."" As I say, Nichols and Sorkin must know better than that.",Charlie Wilson's War
9,Tweekums,If this wasn't based on facts one wouldn't believe it,8,2 June 2014,"Charlie Wilson isn't your stereotypical congressman; he likes to party and staffs his office entirely with attractive young woman; however he doesn't make promises he can't keep. One day, while in a Las Vegas Jacuzzi with a couple of strippers, he sees a news report from Afghanistan; seeing the people there standing up to the might of the Red Army he decides they need more support and on his return to Washington immediately doubles the funding for covert arms supplies to the Mujahideen to a still small ten million dollars. This act gets the attention of Joanne Herring; a very wealthy woman who is passionate about the cause; she wants even more and arranges for Charlie to go to Pakistan to talk to President Zia-ul-Haq who in turn sends him to see the conditions in the refugee camps on the border. Charlie is determined that the fighters must be given modern weapons and sets about meeting the people that can make this happen; this includes a brash CIA man by the name of Gust Avrakotos and an unlikely alliance of Israeli, Egyptian and Pakistani officials. If this wasn't enough he also has to deal with a possible inquiry into an allegation that he used cocaine.One might think a film about raising funds wouldn't be all that interesting but this is a lot of fun as well as being surprisingly funny. This is largely down to Tom Hanks' performance as the larger than life Charlie Wilson and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the hilariously offensive Gust Avrakotos; not the sort of characters one would have associated with the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan. It isn't all laughs though; we are told about the suffering of the Afghan people and without labouring the point there are dark hints that America hasn't heard the last of Afghanistan just because the Red Army was defeated and the Soviet Union collapsed. Overall this was a surprisingly entertaining film that I found well worth watching.",Charlie Wilson's War
10,moonspinner55,"Hanks is congenial--if not totally convincing--as a playboy Congressman ""of no significant importance""...",6,1 August 2010,"Serio-comic adaptation of George Crile's non-fiction book ""Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History"" has been cast with all eyes on the box-office, though the film is pulled off with considerable skill despite occasional lapses in taste. While in Pakistan, U.S. Democratic Congressman Charlie Wilson from Texas (Tom Hanks, miscast but doing his best) makes a special visit to the Pakistani leaders on advice from society maven Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts); he quickly realizes, however, he's out of his league when discussing the lack of support shown to the Afghani people by the United States in regards to Russian military forces, and vows to help the country in protecting themselves from the opposition. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay wisely forges ahead into the political arena without a lot of needless exposition or chit-chat, and director Mike Nichols keeps the scenario lively and colorful (though the Soviet Union--who aren't involved enough here to speak for their alleged actions--comes across as bloodthirsty killers, which some say was hardly the case). Hanks doesn't have the brawl or bravado of a Texan, nor the boisterous gait of a womanizer, but he works smoothly with his co-stars. Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman (as political wild card Gust Avrakotos), and Amy Adams (who drifts in and out as Wilson's top aide) all give entertaining performances, though sometimes the rude humor intercedes on the human drama, and Nichols isn't nimble enough in his approach to guide the narrative from one distinctive mood to the next. **1/2 from ****",Charlie Wilson's War
11,blanche-2,making friends and influencing people,8,5 August 2010,"Tom Hanks wages ""Charlie Wilson's War"" in this 2007 Mike Nichols film, based on the best-selling non-fiction book. Hanks plays Charlie Wilson, a congressman and a good man who likes the good life - women, booze, and an occasional snort of coke. But don't be fooled. Though he seems like a minor player in Congress, he's a member of two foreign policy committees and one covert operation committee. He's approached by a wealthy conservative activist, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) to become involved in the plight of the people of Afghanistan, who, occupied by the Russians, are suffering horribly.Hanks enlists the help of Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and commits himself to calling in favors and getting the budget for this ""cold war"" increased in order to supply the Afghans with weapons that can defeat the Russians.Mike Nichols' direction and casting mines the humor to be found in the story, particularly in the character of Gust Avrakotos. Philip Seymour Hoffman is positively fantastic in the role, and some of the best moments of the film are his altercations with his boss and his conversations with Wilson. Hanks does a terrific job as the laid-back Congressman, who surrounds himself with beautiful women and makes no excuses for it.I'm not quite sure why Mike Nichols is such a fan of Julia Roberts. Perhaps it's a box office ploy. For my money, she was lousy. I'll give her this - she has great taste in the film roles she chooses. Her in and out accent and external characterization were no match for the other actors.Excellent film. Wilson's efforts had far-reaching results that he could never have predicted, but he proved himself to be a compassionate man and someone who could actually get something done. Rarities today.",Charlie Wilson's War
12,Quinoa1984,sly little political satire in the guise of a 'this-is-what-happened' story,7,23 December 2007,"Mike Nichols's latest tragic-comedy, Charlie Wilson's War, details the story of one man's attempts (and success) in fighting the Soviet communists via the Afghans in the 1980s. Actually, that's not entirely correct: under some pressure from a right-wing lady-of-wealth in Joanne (Julia Roberts), Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) started to look further into Afghanistan, and got somehow a tactic of supplying the Afghans weapons to fight the Soviets covertly through his own congress (that, and the complete guidance of Gust, played in probably the best part by Philip Seymour Hoffman).It's a story with lots of little bits and shards of humor, but Nichols also happens to have a good scene that shows what is the quintessential aspect of the character of Charlie Wilson, surprisingly well played by Hanks as a charming, affluent and intelligent man with big tendencies for drink and young female flesh. There's a scene where he's meeting with Hoffman's character for the first time, and as the two talk about tactics starting off towards the problem with the Afghanistan conflict, he keeps getting interrupted by his interns (or his 'Jailbait' as he calls them) who are giving him the scoop and finding out what to say about a scandal breaking out about him with hookers and cocaine. Meanwhile, as Wilson juggles these two sides, Hoffman's Gust offers the best advice of all- following a tap put on Wilson's gift from Gust, a bottle of Scotch.That one scene illustrates greatly, and hilariously, what these two men, Wilson especially, are all about. And it might even be the one scene that can stick to the story while also seeming floating above it. While Nichols does get little jokes in the mix that work well in the vein of his past works ala Catch 22 and Primary Colors (my favorites were a quick sight gag of ignored Native Americans in Ned Beatty's office, and a talk between two Soviets about their sex lives as Afghans get ready with their first torpedoes), it's not for a necessarily great work. It's admirable, and even more fun than it should be. But it also lacks the ""umpf"" of a superb work like Primary Colors. Roberts's part could've been played by someone else, possibly much better, and there feels like things were left out for the sake of a running time between 90 and 120 minutes. It could've been longer, meatier, and it would've helped. Skipping over the bulk of the 80s, with a story like this, seems to be a little erroneous.And, in the end, there's not a whole lot that can be taken away from Wilson's story except that giving arms to a people will eventually- if not cleaned up right- will cause trouble later on. The best I can say about Charlie Wilson's War- and I do recommend it above all else to mature audiences who might be interested in a little more with their Tom Hanks movies and think Hoffman is the latest Godsend of actors- is that it does its job well and doesn't give off any real bad vibes. But if tart, ironic exposes are your bag, have at it, at the least during this Christmas season.",Charlie Wilson's War
13,tavm,Charlie Wilson's War was an entertaining political satire based on a true story,9,10 July 2008,"Watching this movie, I have to admit that politics-while fascinating-can also be confusing when I think about who's fighting for whom and why and how evil and good anyone is. That said, I found myself mainly on the side of the title character and the way he does things. And Tom Hanks makes him very likable both in spite of and because of many of his flaws as a human being. I mean look at all the women he has working for him: all hot as hell with Amy Adams a bit more demure by comparison but still good looking. And director Mike Nichols and writer Aaron Sorkin provide some very funny lines and scenes involving not just him but Phillip Seymour Hoffman (that scene with James Slatterly is especially noteworthy), many of those pretty women I alluded to, Ms. Adams, and Julia Roberts as the Texas socialite Hanks has a thing for. I understood most of what I was watching and how it went wrong, but also how what happened seemed necessary at the time. I'd probably have to watch it again to really take it all in, but for the most part, Charlie Wilson's War was one of the most entertaining political movies I've seen in my life.

17,sunwarrior13,Charlie Wilson's War Works At All Level,10,28 December 2011,"Produced by Tom Hanks, written by Aaron Sorkin, and directed by Mike Nichols, this film adaptation of George Crile III's incendiary bestseller entitled,Charlie Wilson's War:The Extraordinary Story of the Largest Covert Operation in History tells the remarkable story of the Texas congressman whose efforts to prevent the Red Army from overtaking Afghanistan eventually led to the collapse of the Soviet Union while simultaneously fueling the rise of radical Islam. Charlie Wilson's War is a biopic comedy drama recounting the true story of U.S. Congressman Charlie Wilson.It stars stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts together with Om Puri, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Ned Beatty and Emily Blunt.The story takes place in the early 1980s.A hastily assembled army of Afghan ""freedom fighters"" achieved the remarkable feat of fending off Soviet invaders despite the fact that the odds were overwhelmingly stacked against them. At the time, Texas congressman Charlie Wilson was a key member of the hugely powerful House Appropriations Committee. Illuminated to the specifics of this remarkable war by a high-profile Houston socialite, Wilson spearheaded an effort to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons and training to the Mujahideen with more than a little help from brilliant but prickly CIA operative Gust Avrokotos.Charlie follows Gust's guidance to seek support for post- Soviet occupation Afghanistan, but finds almost no enthusiasm in the U.S. government for even the modest measures he proposes. It ends with Charlie receiving a major commendation for the support of the U.S. clandestine services, but his pride is tempered by his fears of what unintended consequences his secret efforts could yield in the future and the implications of U.S. disengagement from Afghanistan.Charlie Wilson's War is a good movie since it manages to entertain and inform audiences.Obviously,its witty script about a terrific tale of political wheeling and dealing as well as the talented cast of power players led by Hanks and Roberts were big reasons behind it.Special mention should also be given to Seymour Hoffman,who definitely deserved his Oscar nomination for this film.And of course,Nichols' direction was masterful and excellent.In summary,this film works at all level.A must- see for every viewer who loves great films.",Charlie Wilson's War
18,dbborroughs,Good as a stand alone film it falls down in trying to explain how we ended up where we are today,5,5 January 2008,"Charlie Wilson, a hard partying congressman that no one has ever heard of finds he must do something for the Afghans when the Soviets invades and manages to funnel millions of dollars to the rebels with the help of a tell like it is CIA officer and a socialite with connections. In other words, this is the story of how we put the Taliban in power.Mike Nichols has made a jokey, yet strangely un-compelling film about how we ended up in the world we have today. Well made to be sure , I kept wondering what they weren't telling us. running a breezy 100 minutes the film mostly consists of Charlie running around trying to get someone to help him as he insists that he can get the money needed to run the Soviets out of Kabul.Other than his concern and the baggage we carry from knowing what the cold war was we really don't have much of a plot. It seemed to me that there should be more to this story than just one guy running from place to place. Even the hints of an investigation into congresses misdeeds (aka Partying members) goes nowhere and seems to have been included as an after thought. What I would have been the point of telling this story now, revelations of Hoffman's character to Hanks about what has happened now that they won fall flat. And as for Wilson quote that ends the film my reaction was ""yea so"" instead of ""yes right"".It doesn't help that there are no real characters other than Philip Seymour Hoffman's CIA Afghan desk chief.Everyone is pretty much a cypher or more to the point eye candy or a cardboard representation of a person. Hank's Wilson is a concerned but shallow womanized under threat of indictment for partying too much.He's a sweet guy but who is he? I don't know. Its less of a character than many of his earlier characters in films like Volunteers. Julia Roberts gives a good weighty performance but we know almost nothing about her. Who is she? I don't have a clue. How do you write about people who don't really exist on screen? Off screen you can feel this whole life, but none of it is ever touched on.Nichols' film is watchable,and on the most basic level, being watchable it works. If nothing else it has several really good set pieces, chief among them the first meeting of Hoffman and Hanks, and the meeting of Hoffman and his boss at CIA where they both think the other is going to apologize but nothing connects these good pieces to anything, to each other or to our lives in the world today, they are good pieces almost in a vacuum. As entertainment they work, but as something more, something meaningful it all falls flat In a weird way this is the weakest of all of the films released in 2007 about the wars the US is fighting. To be certain other films are more flawed, clichéd, some are a total mess, but everyone of them had a passion and a desire to tell you a story that the filmmakers felt was important. I may not have agreed or liked the story they were telling but you could at least feel that the people behind the film were trying desperately to express, and even when it was badly done I knew what they were getting at, I knew what they were trying to say to me even when their ability to say it failed them. Here I have no idea why I'm being told this story. Yes I know why because from Charlie Wilson fighting his war and arming the Taliban, we ended up having to fight a war to get them out of the very place we put them. Unfortunately that was something I knew going in and was not and is not something that is on the screen. I have no idea why Nichols and Hanks and Roberts and Hoffman and everyone else are bothering to tell me this story.What makes this story so important? No idea, at least not from the film itself.As a watchable movie on its own with no connection and no pretense at being important- 6 out of 10. As a film that has meaning and with a pretense of telling you something- 3 or 4 out of 10.",Charlie Wilson's War
19,lastliberal,America's success and shame,9,22 December 2007,"I quit watching ""The West Wing"" after Aaron Sorkin quit writing and producing. It just wasn't the same. Imagine my thrill at seeing a film that he wrote again. It has been a long time - The American President, A Few Good Men. His script was a beautiful blend of humor and tragedy. He made a compelling story believable, and made me weep at the same time.Tom Hanks was incredible as a small-time Texas Congressman whose constituents only wanted lower taxes and to keep their guns. Not a hard job, so he had plenty of time to fool around - and that he did. His office staff looked as if he were at the Playboy Mansion. Like he reportedly said, ""You can teach them to type, but you can't teach them to grow tits."" Despite his sexist attitude, which fits right in with a Texas Congressman, they were fiercely loyal, especially his aide, Amy Adams (Junebug & former Hooters girl).Now, add a rich Texas socialite who wants something done in Afghanistan, played perfectly by Julia Roberts; and a pain-in-his-boss's-ass CIA agent, superbly done by Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have a movie well worth watching.Outstanding writing, and superlative acting, and a story that needed to be told. What more do you want at the movies?",Charlie Wilson's War
20,zardoz-13,"The Best Tom Hanks Movie Since ""Forrest Gump""",10,2 January 2008,"The top-notch new Tom Hanks political comedy ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (**** out of ****) qualifies as his best movie since ""Forrest Gump."" This insightful but outrageous epic about behind-the-scenes American foreign policy illustrates the adage that good intentions pave the road to Hell. ""West Wing"" writer Aaron Sorkin and ""Catch-22"" director Mike Nichols have shrunk George Grile's massive 500 page bestseller down to a nimble 96 minutes. Happily, they never miss a chance to skewer Congress. Mind you, Congress deserves everything it gets in ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" but this review addresses the film's artistic merits rather than its political realities.According to this wicked satirical yarn, a Texas playboy Congressman (Tom Hanks of ""Big"") formed an alliance with a rich, right-wing, born-again, Communist-hating, Houston socialite (Julia Roberts of ""Pretty Woman"") and a profane, blue-collar CIA agent (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to arm Afghan rebels with the best arsenal that U.S. dollars could buy under the table. This improbable trio pushed a billion dollar appropriation for Afghanistan through Congress and then smuggled them Soviet-made, shoulder-mounted, rocket-launchers through an elaborate underground operation that involved an uneasy alliance among Egypt, Israel, and Pakistan. The Afghan insurgentsbetter known as the mujahedinused Stinger missiles to oust the Soviets from their homeland. Inadvertently, our heroes pulled the red carpet out from under the Soviet. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 and the Cold War came to an end. Now, a lot of Ronald Reagan supporters will contest this account. However, the irony is that once the Soviets were driven out, the lack of support from Congress led to the Taliban take-over that nurtured the anti-Western Islamic terrorists who want to destroy all who refused to be ruled by such 7th-century fanatics.Oscar winner Tom Hanks is charismatically Machiavellian as Charlie Wilson, a scandal-riddled, House Democrat from Texas's Second Congressional District, who loves to party. Wilson's staff consists of savvy, drop-dead gorgeous babes that keep him out of hot water, and Charlie never misses a chance to socialize with his Texas constituents or his Jewish supporters. One night in a Las Vegas Jacuzzi with a couple of strippers, Charlie catches the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather reporting from inside war-torn Afghanistan. Rather's report sparks Charlie's interest because an Afghan woman cannot understand why America doesn't help her people stop the Soviet genocide in her country.No sooner has Charlie checked up on the pathetic budget given the Afghans than power-broker Joanne Herring (Oscar winner Julia Roberts in her best Barbara Stanwyck impersonation) rings him up because she wants him to visit Afghan refugee camps. Although she is born-again, Joanne has no qualms about hopping from one bed to another and she has an on-again/off-again sexual liaison with Charlie. Eventually, they visit the refugee camps in Peshawar and the sight of kids whose arms have been blown off by the Soviets spurs Charlie's efforts Later, Charlie calls in pugnacious CIA agent Gust Avarkotos (Oscar winner Philip Seymour Hoffman of ""Capote"") to figure out a way to get the rebels their weapons without incriminating Uncle Sam. Gust relishes anything that will pay off in Soviet casualties. Principally, the Afghans need a weapon that can obliterate the heavily armored Soviet helicopter gunships. When Afghans get their rocket launchers, Soviet gunships start dropping like flies.The best thing about ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is that its revelations never sound like a stuffy history lesson.",Charlie Wilson's War
21,grantss,Excellent,9,2 April 2018,"Early 1980s. Charlie Wilson is a relatively unimportant and unproductive Texas congressman. He does have one advantage - he is on two important committees, covering foreign and military policy. He learns of the situation in Afghanistan and how the Russians are treating the Afghanis and is determined to help, through providing the Mujahideen with weapons. This sets in motion an unlikely sequence of deals and alliances. Excellent movie. Covers an important series of events in world history, the short-term consequences of which were positive, the long term less so. Does so in very light, funny fashion. This highlights the farcicalness of some of the events, and helps the story move along. It would have been a very dry movie if it was entirely serious.Despite the non-seriousness of much of the movie, has a very powerful and profound final message.Great acting by Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and, especially, Philip Seymour Hoffman.",Charlie Wilson's War
22,Boba_Fett1138,Feels incomplete and its not edgy enough concerning its subject but it's a fine movie to watch.,7,4 September 2008,"Consistency is perhaps this movie its biggest problem. The movie starts of as a fast, stylish and just plain fun political satire but in its second halve the movie gets more serious of tone, in an almost Oliver Stone kind of way. It's of course also a very serious subject but I would say that the movie would had been way better and also more effective if it had been completely done in the same style as the first halve of the movie got shot in.For a biography and a movie concerning the subject of this movie, the movie is also quite short with its mere 102 minutes of running time. The movie because of this feels like it isn't telling the whole story. Of course the following up of the events after the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan gets hinted at in the movie but the movie doesn't go deeper into it and it doesn't explain much about it, which feels like a cheap way to just glorify Charlie Wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. Also the actual events in the movie itself gets rather simplified, even though the story still gets told (needlessly) complex at times.Yes, the movie would just had been way better if it was not trying to be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere. The movie should had been for instance more like ""Wag the Dog"", that achieved to find a right combination of satire and sensitive political issues.Because of this incoherent style and way of storytelling, the acting performances are also mixed. When Tom Hanks is playing his character more playfully and in a more comical kind of way he's just excellent. But this just makes it sort of hard to take his character serious in the more serious and sensitive/shocking moments of the movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent though, as he is in any movie that he plays in. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. Most of the other actors just seem to walk around in this movie, just to be in the movie. This goes mostly for Julia Roberts, whose character I found just too mysterious to seem to have a clear enough purpose for the movie. She made a redundant impression on me and is therefor also really forgettable in this movie.It's not that the movie is a bad watch, it actually is quite good and also enjoyable but if the movie would had dared to be a bit more edgier the movie would had been a better and foremost also more effective one at what it tried to obviously achieve.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Charlie Wilson's War
23,view_and_review,Before the Taliban,8,30 May 2021,"Before Afghanistan was known as the home of the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, they were fighting a bloody war against the Russians. And they were losing. Bad.So, how did a major motion picture get made about an obscure congressman named Charlie Wilson who's so unknown he has to google himself to know who he is? When you watch this film you see that it was something that needed to be made--not to make the world aware of Charlie Wilson necessarily, but to make the world aware of a decade in which Afghanistan was being mercilessly obliterated by Russia and how the tables turned.Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) was a hedonistic congressman representing a small part of Texas. In the grand scale of things he was barely a blip on the radar, but he was on the subcommittee for covert defense spending, and that made him a bit of a somebody. When he arbitrarily doubled the CIA's covert budget from $5 million to $10 million he became just a little more important. It was then that he was made aware of the Soviet Union's actions in Afghanistan by a wealthy, ultra-right wing, religious woman named Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts). She had the kind of money, clout, and sexual prowess to gently nudge Charlie Wilson toward supporting a cause she passionately believed in.""Charlie Wilson's War"" started out kind of sleazy and despicable. After twenty minutes I was beginning to ask myself why should I be watching a womanizing lush congressman; even if he is played by Tom Hanks. The gears caught and the movie gained traction once Wilson met with the president of Pakistan, President Zia (Om Puri). The movie became a speeding locomotive when Wilson met with CIA operative Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Hanks and Hoffman on screen together was fantastic. Even when their banter morphed into political and military jargon I didn't completely follow I still was entranced.Like any movie about politics and/or war, your pleasure or displeasure with the movie will have a lot to do with your own politics. I happen to believe that America's covert intervention to arm helpless Afghans against a genocidal bully was a commendable move and seeing a movie about such a move is nice. Of course, it helps if the movie is done well, which this was.",Charlie Wilson's War

25,evanston_dad,A Smart Comedy from Mike Nichols,8,3 January 2008,"Mike Nichols has always had a knack for making slick, populist entertainments that are smart enough for adults to enjoy, and that's exactly what ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is. It's supremely entertaining and has just enough bite to get its point across without scaring away moviegoers who have a fear of ""important"" or ""intellectual"" cinema.Tom Hanks plays Charlie Wilson, a senator who in 1980 stumbled into a covert war to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan. How he stumbles into it and the various parties who coerce and assist him comprise the meat of the movie. Julia Roberts, the film's weakest link, plays a Texas millionaire who serves as the catalyst for the operation. I wasn't remotely convinced by Roberts' performance, and she seems too young for the part, but the movie succeeds in spite of her. Philip Seymour Hoffman can't help but steal every scene he's in as a CIA operative in league with Wilson. And Hanks himself manages his good 'ol boy role with aplomb. I always end up liking Hanks more than I want to.The film never gets too far away from smart comedy, but it does manage to raise quite a few hard to answer questions about hot button issues like religion, women's rights, government corruption, etc. Through it all pulses a warm pride and love of America which I appreciated. The film is critical of our government, to be certain; but it also makes the point that one of the things that makes America great is each citizen's right to criticize his/her leaders without fear of persecution, a luxury many other citizens of other countries don't have.Grade: A",Charlie Wilson's War
26,ferguson-6,"Here's to you, you ...",7,22 December 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. Based on a true story and the book by George Crile, we get a glimpse at the covert war instigated by Congressman Charlie Wilson (from Texas) after the Russian invasion of Afghanistan around 1980. Director Mike Nichols has a few gems on his resume, including ""The Graduate"", ""Carnal Knowledge"" and ""Silkwood"". Sadly, his most recent film prior to this was the tasteless and utter garbage known as ""Closer"". Mr. Nichols can be much more proud of this one.Tom Hanks again shows why he is one of the most remarkable leading men in the history of Hollywood. He once again transforms himself, physically and personality-wise to become the former Congressman. His Texas accent is far superior to Ms. Roberts', who never really comes close to capturing the essence of a wealthy Texas lady sophisticate. Hanks doesn't shy away from the infamous character flaws of Wilson and truly excels in those awkward moments when dealing with the President of Pakistan.The absolute best scenes in the film are those with both Hanks and the great Philip Seymour Hoffman. These two go at each other like brothers and the wit is flying fast and furiously! These are the best scenes and the best dialogue and are the main reason the film is so darn entertaining. Hoffman plays like a caged animal dropped in the middle of society ... he only knows one way to act and that is to punch you in the nose with his intellect and quips.Two usually outstanding performers are given little to do. Amy Adams (""Junebug"" and ""Enchanted"" follows Hanks around like a puppy dog. Emily Blunt ""Devil Wears Prada"" seems to be in the film for only one reason ... to strip down to her skivvies and show off her tightly honed legs and torso. Surely the final cut is missing a scene between Hanks and Blunt that makes their encounter plausible. A major flaw from an experienced filmmaker like Nichols.The core story really is fascinating at we see the maneuvering that goes on between politicians as they negotiate for votes. As great as our system is, we should periodically be reminded that the votes aren't cast by what is right and wrong, but moreso according to who cut what deals behind closed doors. There are a few buffoons on display here including the US diplomat stationed in Pakistan and the committee chairman played pretty well by the long lost Ned Beatty.The best part about the film is the true story it is based upon. Knowing that a few cared enough about the topic to make a difference is thought-provoking and fascinating. This film is entertaining enough for the masses, but provides a few stellar lines that will probably blow by those too impressed with the pomposity of Ms. Roberts and her diamonds and hair.",Charlie Wilson's War
27,anaconda-40658,Charlie Wilson's Peace Play.,8,10 March 2016,"Charlie Wilson's War (2007): Dir: Mike Nichols / Cast: Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Emily Blunt: Provocative drama about one man's journey into overthrowing the Soviet Union. Congressman Charlie Wilson embarks on a quest to send arms to Afghanistan whom are at war with the Soviets. Attitude and placement of humour are off balance but director Mike Nichols advocates a strong point of view. He also presents Wilson's flaws verses his accomplishments. Nichols is an accomplished director with such titles as The Graduate and The Birdcage. Tom Hanks is superb as Wilson who holds his own under the spotlight of the media. Julia Roberts plays Joanne Herring whom establishes his contacts. What really works here is how the screenplay doesn't play off a romantic fling and presents these individuals as people. Strong supporting work by Philip Seymour Hoffman who steals scenes as a foul CIA agent. Amy Adams also steals moments as Wilson's administrative assistant. Other roles are not quite as broad, and Emily Blunt is featured amongst actors who have had more challenging roles. What is interesting is that she holds strong even in the company of such famous leads. The film is well made, ranking as one of Nichols's best efforts. Interesting film about the defeat of the Soviet Union through one man's dealings. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Charlie Wilson's War

However, prodded by his major conservative supporter, Houston Socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), Wilson learns about the plight the people are suffering in the brutal Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. With the help of the maverick CIA agent, Gustav ""Gust"" Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Wilson dedicates his canny political efforts to supply the Afghan mujahedeen with the weapons and support to defeat the Soviet Union. However, Charlie Wilson eventually learns that while military victory can be had, there are other consequences and prices to that fight that are ignored to everyone's sorrow.'The supporting cast is very strong with Amy Adams as Charlie's assistant, Mary-Bonner Baker, Wynn Everett, Rachel Nichols and Shiri Appleby as Charlie's office girls, Om Puri, Emily Blunt and on and on. Philip Seymour Hoffman offers the finest performance of his too short career, Tom hanks shines as Charlie in all aspect of the character's qualities, and Julia Roberts is a haughty sensation. This cast allows the viewer to laugh at the shenanigans of the Washington DC political crowd - a very timely film to see today as the disruptions of the Middle East continue to fester and Congress just continues to be 'Congressional'.... For those who applauded the release of the film in 2007 and for those who have never experienced this little satire, now is a great tie to view it.",Charlie Wilson's War
29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Charlie Wilson's War,8,1 March 2008,"We've seen the state of the world as it is in today, and movies like The Kingdom and Lions for Lambs have continued to paint scenarios that are based in the realities of today. But if you've ever wondered how events have unfolded to become what it is now, then you can probably look no further than Charlie Wilson's War for a quick, up to date summary.Mike Nichols directs a stellar cast in this drama which is based on true life events of a US Congressman who, together with his associates, handled the wheelings and dealings of foreign policy and covert operations to assist the Afghanistan mujahedeens in their battle against the Soviet invasion. With casting like Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, rising star Amy Adams and the acclaimed Philip Seymour Hoffman, how can you not want to not watch the movie? And contrary to the very light, fuzzy comedic feeling that the trailer seemed to display, the movie is anything but.It offers a lot of insights into the political landscape of the time, reinforcing the idea that things are not always what they seem on the surface, where enemies can become friends if they share a common goal, and that there are plenty of buttering and greasing palms in nice ways through owing of favours, and then returning them through various methods of support to push bills and the likes.Tom Hanks hams it up as Charlie Wilson, the Texan Congressman with questionable morals who indirectly holds the pursestrings to the defence spending on covert operations, and through his rather paltry doubling of the budget, he slowly learns from Gust Avrakotos (Hoffman), the CIA man, what exactly needs to be done in order to turn the tide for the Afghans. And leading the fundraising and awareness effort is Julia Robert's rich socialite Joanne Herring. Strange bedfellows, all of them, but everyone with their own agenda which converges and sends significant changes halfway across the world.Charlie Wilson's War is a delightful movie to sit through, like a biography for all the characters involved in this episode in history that started the ball rolling, and because of the usual half-heartedness in seeing things through, we are where we are today. Containing plenty of slick lines of dialogue, the movie never bores, even though its presentation is a pretty straightforward narrative from start to end. For those who are a wee bit interested to know how it all started, and the intricacies in international negotiations, covert ops, and simply put, perception, then this is the movie to catch!",Charlie Wilson's War
30,siderite,Ingenious mix of American propaganda and reality,7,22 October 2008,"There are some movies that tell you from the beginning they are full of inaccuracies (there is another word for it:) ). Many drama and moral/political/religious oriented movies fall in this category. There are others that are ""too"" real, saying the things that no one would say, making the viewers become emotionally involved until they realize there is just as much bull on the other side as well.Well, Charlie Wilson's War was both! When you thought it's all a US propaganda movie it would turn and bite everybody on the ass, then go back again. It actually made for an interesting balance around the (what I think is the) truth.The plot revolves around THE senator who figured out that Afghanistan is a thorn in the Russian side and decided to fund the ""freedom fighters"" in order to starve the Soviet Union of resources and kudos. The senator, played by Tom Hanks, has no problem being a womanizer, a heavy drinker and drugs user while also being a US senator.The movie ends with a warning about the repercussions of one's actions. I can't tell more without spoiling it.Bottom line: can one accurately depict the truth by describing the extremes? This movie comes pretty close. At the very least is thought provoking, without being belligerent. A bit boring at times, but it is based on real events, so not so much base material. My conclusion: if you are into politics and/or Tom Hanks, you should see it.",Charlie Wilson's War
31,JamesHitchcock,Quite an Achievement,7,30 September 2010,"The Soviet war in Afghanistan (aka Russia's Vietnam) featured as the background to a few action/adventure films of the 1980s, such as the third ""Rambo"" adventure and the Bond film ""The Living Daylights"". ""Charlie Wilson's War"" revisits this largely forgotten conflict (forgotten, that is, by Hollywood), but does so from a quite different perspective. Instead of dealing with Rambo or Bond-type heroics it chronicles the struggle inside the American government to organise support for the Afghan mujahideen fighting against the Soviet occupation of their country.The action begins in 1980. Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson is one of the less distinguished members of Congress, a womanising playboy more interested in throwing parties, drinking and pursuing his attractive young female assistants than in political affairs. He is even under investigation for alleged cocaine use. (The allegation is eventually dropped, but only because the alleged use took place outside American jurisdiction). His life is changed when a friend, the right-wing political activist Joanne Herring, draws his attention to the plight of the Afghan people under Soviet occupation. A visit to an Afghan refugee camp in Pakistan means that, at long last, Wilson has a cause to fight for.He begins to campaign for an increase in American funding to the mujahideen and joins forces with CIA operative Gust Avrakotos to work out the most practical ways of supplying assistance, especially in enabling the Afghan resistance to counter the threat posed by Soviet helicopter gunships. One difficulty they face is that the US administration insists that the mujahideen should not be supplied with American-made weapons, so Wilson and Avrakotos have to find ways of supplying them with captured Soviet-made ones. There are some good acting contributions from Tom Hanks as Wilson, Julia Roberts as Joanne and Philip Seymour Hoffman (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor) as Avrakotos. This was Roberts's first on-screen appearance since the birth of her twins in 2004, although she did provide voices for two animated films in 2006.The film's politics are relatively conservative, despite Hollywood's normal reputation for liberalism. Wilson, played by Hanks as a likable rogue who suddenly finds the idealist within him, is a Democrat rather than a Republican, but in the seventies and eighties ""Democrat"" and ""liberal"" were not automatically synonymous. (Nor, for that matter, were ""Republican"" and ""conservative""). The Soviets in Afghanistan are depicted as cruel invaders, using booby-trap mines to kill or maim children and delighting in machine-gunning civilians from the air. Charlie Wilson himself is very much the hero of the story. At the end of the film he does express criticism of the American government for their neglect of Afghanistan after the end of the Cold War and the overthrow of that country's Communist regime in 1992, a neglect which was eventually to lead to the Taliban's seizure of power.The film does not, however, take the line which has become common in left-wing circles (and some right-wing ones) in recent years, namely that, had the Soviets been allowed to deal with Afghanistan in their own way in the eighties, America and the West would not be confronted today with a terrorist threat from Al-Qaeda and other militant Islamic groups. I think that it is right to reject this argument, which ignores both the brutality of Communist rule in Afghanistan and the political complexities of the situation. By no means all the Afghan resistance groups were Islamic fanatics, and the rise of the Taliban was not an inevitable consequence of the overthrow of Communism.I have always regarded Mike Nichols as a director who made a masterpiece with his second feature film, ""The Graduate"", and who has spent the rest of his long career trying to repeat his triumph. I do not think he has ever quite achieved this, although he has been responsible for some very good films, including ""Silkwood"" ""Working Girl"" and ""Primary Colors"". ""Charlie Wilson's War"", his most recent film to date, is another to add to this list. Nichols succeeds, with the help of Hanks, Roberts and Hoffman, in making political intrigue and the doings of Congressional sub-committees seem both interesting and relevant. That is quite an achievement. 7/10",Charlie Wilson's War

We have some very promising actors, but even the actors who are all Oscar winners didn't get into this movie, I know that I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but this is a movie that they took in order to just get good reviews, that's it. It's one of those movies where you have to watch it a few times to fully understand unless you are a fan of shows like The West Wing, where the dialog is so out there, unless you know the history of Charlie Wilson, which I will admit I do not, you're not going to understand. It's like being at a party and you join a group of people who know each other and are talking about a past joke of their's and you have no idea what they are talking about.Even though there are some things that I don't understand, I'll do my best to give you the story. Charlie Wilson is a congressman who is pretty popular with others as well as the women. Everything in his life is just great, but when Joanne Herring tells him to take action on the war in Afghanistan, all the pain and suffering that is going on there, she asks Charlie to help fix. So Charlie does his best to fight the war, but he learns that support can also have it's down fall's as well.Charlie Wilson's War, I'm not going to totally bash it, because the acting and script is done very well, Tom, Phillip, and Julia, not to mention Amy Adams as well are terrific actors and click very well. This is just one of those movies that you'll have to trust your instincts on, because I was watching it with an open mind and still did not enjoy it, I was just bored. I feel bad saying that, I feel like a 12 year old saying it, but I'm just being honest. It's a film that only certain people will understand and appreciate, but for me it just sounded like Greek and I felt like I was 2 inches tall while watching it, because I consider myself intelligent, but I was so lost watching this movie.4/10",Charlie Wilson's War
33,blanbrn,"Well done real life political tale that's fun, cool, entertaining and playful a must see.",8,23 December 2007,"Just finished watching ""Charlie Wilson's War"" and for my say it's one of the more recent and better political films, not just because of the real life story of Wilson at the same time the acting and direction was top notch. Director Mike Nichols who has never been one to shy away from controversial topics and issues like politics, sex, gender, race, and social issues scores a gem here with this real life political tale of early 80's congressman Charlie Wilson(Tom Hanks). Starting in early 1980 in a Las Vegas hot tub with Charlie Wilson surrounded by partying playmates from the start we see the womanizing and shady ways of Wilson from drugs, alcohol and women. Charlie Wilson was the real life democrat Texas congressman from Houston who was liberal and booze and skirt chasing, yet all along he knew how to perk power, back scratch and log roll his way to political favors. One day after getting a call from Joanne Herring(Julia Roberts) a wealthy, elegant and sexy right wing rich Houston socialite who wants change and would like to bring down communism and some of the Soviet empire by funding weapons for help to Afghanistan during their cold war against the Soviets. Then from then on the film shows it's jargon of politics with humor, sex, and scandal with wheeling and dealing that stays true to form with politics. As the viewer clearly sees those methods from his events and covert dealings with Joanne like events and even seducing the socialite and meetings with Pakistani government officials to help provide weapons with Israeli arms dealers to persuading other congressmen to invest in weapons these were some fun and smart covert dealings. Most importantly the help to Charlie is provided from smart but shady CIA veteran agent Gust Avrakotos(Philip Seymour Hoffman) who knows the enter and outer works of global politics. Hoffman's performance is very funny and direct his character was so likable. Piece by piece the film is set up so well that finally Wilson's plan happens the weapons are delivered in high quality being first class and ready as now air strikes can begin against the Soviet empire. Misson accomplished? As we see in the end and saw in the future the mission strategic at it's time ended up biting the U.S. in other ways. So the viewer can really be the judge if as to not that Charlie Wilson's funding of weapons to Afghans would later lead to radical jihad or the terrorism of 9/11 or of the present day. The film proved and showed with strong courage even though playful and shady that Charlie Wilson started the downfall of the Soviets and it was Charlie's right to fight his war his way no matter if you agree or disagree because political sides and each and every country are so complex and different. Overall this movie was done very classy and stylish by Nichols the champion of real life issue films, and the acting is top notch from both Hanks and Roberts the chemistry that Tom and Julia had was great their performances made the film watchable and seem even more like the times of the 1980's real life Wilson saga. This movie is a cool and enjoyable winner.",Charlie Wilson's War
34,DKosty123,Don't Screw Up The Peace,8,1 January 2008,"Philip Seymour Hoffman should be nominated as a best supporting actor for this film. He is fantastic. Tom Hanks is does play Charlie well but this is nowhere near his best film acting role. There are plenty of women in the film including. Julia Roberts looks terrible as a blonde as it looks like she is wearing a wig. Julia Roberts is the Texas woman trying to drive help for the Afghans & the role in itself does not really give her a lot to work with in this movie. She does well with a small role. Hanks & Roberts do generate a little spark in their scenes together.Mike Nichols 22nd career directing effort is a well made film. Granted it does take literary light of the real events. It is interesting that some people are thinking this is a piece of Democratic propaganda. Actually, Democrats do not come off any better than Republicans in this movie. The end message sequence about not voting a Million Dollars to build a school after spending a billion dollars to arm the Afghans, while simplistic, happened while Democrats controlled the US Congress.This message has a particular irony in the fact that this conflict did start the slippery slope the United States went on to lead to Osama Bin Laden & today. It is interesting how the Democratic party does things & then manages to blame Republicans for the problems. We didn't win the peace in Afghanistan in fact, & then that did lead us too today.There is an interesting dynamic to how Charlie is portrayed by Hanks. He is a womanizing, coke snorting Congressman from Texas whose stupid actions are outweighed by his actions in bringing together the right people to help the Afghans. This makes Charlie look a lot smarter than he actually is. Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is presented as the brains though. The way this film plays out that is a good thing.This film is solid entertainment effort by Nichols who does adult themed comedy well (1967 The Graduate). As films go, it is solid entertainment. As far as facts, considering all the records for the Clinton Administration & vital records of JFK's shooting in 1963 are still sealed, I doubt that the real facts of what happened in Afghanistan are available either. Nichols does a fine job with the realistic scenes of the Afghans suffering from the Russian invasion. This is serious stuff.Dan Rather gets a more positive spin in this film than he could have. It was during this period that Ronald Reagen made him look like a fool on his own news show. Take this film for what it is, solid entertainment, & thought provoking history.",Charlie Wilson's War
35,lasttimeisaw,Charlie Wilson's War,6,1 January 2012,"I felt sluggish to watch this film which I had bought for many years as I have a hunch that it will not please me (a main ground is Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts' descending judgment of plumping for right roles); however, since I have an ambitious plan not to miss any Oscar- nominated films, particularly with acting nominations as my topmost priority, thanks to Philip Seymour Hoffman, I have no excuse to shun it.The film is a lot shorter than I expected, and most of the time its satirical tone conforms with the storyline swiftly in spite of its thorny political engagement. Claiming to be a non-fictional biography, the frivolous keynote does deprive a great amount of authenticity of the story per se, (what Charlie did in the film seems to be truly effortless and basically without any genuine barricades, which makes the film look highly doubtful, I think it is a whitewashed biopic which suits well only for its satirical tenor, and if only history could talk!), so even the Oscar-winning veteran director Mike Nichols cannot upgrade the film into the elite rank like his previous works (just to name a few, such as THE GRADUATE 1967, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? 1966, WIT 2001, or even CLOSER 2004), notwithstanding that Aaron Sorkin's sharp-witted script is a bonus. Regardless of the certitude of the narratives, the film is an elegant politics lampoon, it intrigues its viewer into a labyrinthine puzzle about the Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan in the early 1980s, and the intricate Cold War status, but fails to elucidate the entire undertaking in a compelling method, instead it is painstakingly establishing a paradigm of an American hero who has single-handed ended the Cold War menace, which is extremely repellent for me. The Tom-and-Julia pair in the film is perkily fluid, but no vigorous vibes and Hanks' womanizer image is extremely overstating, by comparison Philip Seymour Hoffman becomes the saving grace of the cast, not his best but riveting enough to garner an Oscar nomination under his belt.",Charlie Wilson's War
36,sddavis63,An Unlikely Visionary,7,8 October 2008,"For most of this movie I was consigning this to the ranks of mildly interesting political history. It was based on a true story, and a check of the facts told me that essentially what was being portrayed was true. So - I learned a lot from it. I've been among those who essentially credited Ronald Reagan with winning the Cold War by engaging the Soviet Union in an arms race it had no choice but to fight but no chance to win. I'm not prepared to abandon that position and go so far as suggesting - as some of the hype around this movie suggested - that it was Congressman Charles Wilson who won the Cold War, but I do understand - after watching this movie - that Charlie, who was unknown to me before - certainly played a big role. Still, the bulk of the movie deals with the backroom wheeling and dealing that accompanies appropriations - important stuff, but not exactly the most exciting subject material for a movie.Tom Hanks - as usual - was superb in the title role as Charlie Wilson, the womanizing, heavy drinking Texas Congressman dismissed by most as a joke but who, shielded by representing a congressional district he probably couldn't lose if he tried, was able to finagle his way to a position of some behind the scenes influence in Washington. The depiction of Wilson helped bring some fun to what was for the most part a somewhat dry movie, and Charlie was a lot of fun, from the opening scene with the strippers in the hot tub, to his coterie of pretty young female assistants, to his assessment of Congress (asked why Congress would say one thing and do nothing, Charlie replied ""tradition, mostly."") Charlie, though, had a wisdom that went beyond his somewhat buffoonish image. He understood the importance of defeating the Soviets in Afghanistan, and became the driving force behind funding and arming the Mujahideen fighting the Soviets in that country. That led ultimately, of course, to the embarrassment (for the USSR) of the Soviets having to withdraw their forces in defeat, which many would suggest was the first domino that led directly to the 1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union. Charlie's wisdom went beyond that, though. While most Americans celebrated the defeat of the Soviet Union, Charlie understood that the US couldn't (or at least shouldn't) stop there. He wanted to continue providing help to the Afghans to rebuild their country. Congress, though (and the administration) had moved on to Eastern Europe, which led to the last 15 minutes or so of the movie.Here's where a mildly interesting movie became a sobering and thought-provoking one. It began with a stunning effect by director Mike Nichols. Charlie is talking to his CIA contact Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Gust is telling him that since the Soviets pulled out ""the crazies"" had already started moving into Kandahar. As he explains this to Charlie, we hear the sound of a jetliner flying past overhead. When you combine Afghanistan with jetliners in the post 9/11 world, you can only think of September 11, 2001. The links! The Americans helped rid Afghanistan of the Soviet Union but then pulled out themselves and forgot about the country (and allowed Afghanistan to forget about the U.S.) until it was too late. The final scenes of Charlie in the congressional committee arguing for funding to rebuild Afghan schools, only to be dismissed by another member who couldn't even keep Afghanistan and Pakistan straight had an element of sadness to it.That last 15 minutes really raises this movie a notch or two in my books. To that point, it's no better than OK, but once all the connections hit home, you're glad to have watched this. 7/10",Charlie Wilson's War
37,Buddy-51,an old-fashioned big star vehicle,7,8 January 2008,"In 1980, Charlie Wilson was an obscure Texas congressman, more notable for his folksy manner and serial womanizing than for any legislative accomplishments. Until, that is, he became actively involved in getting Congress to covertly fund some badly needed weapon shipments to the Afghani freedom fighters - also known as the Mujahadim - in their battle against the Soviet invaders. It was these arms, particularly the anti-aircraft guns, that helped to turn the tide of the war in the Afghanis' favor and made them the only force in history to defeat the Soviet army. Wilson was greatly inspired by a wealthy, right-wing socialite by the name of Joanne Herring who took up the Afghani's cause almost as a personal crusade.Though glitzy and superficial at times, Mike Nichols' ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" based on the book by George Crile, is a generally entertaining romp thanks to the performances of its mega-watt stars, Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and to the breezy, crackling dialogue by scenarist Aaron Sorkin, of TV's ""West Wing"" fame. Hanks has rarely seemed as confident and commanding in a role as he is here, and Roberts clearly relishes playing a woman who is both icily elegant and strangely vulnerable at one and the same time. In their sizzling scenes together, the two old pros conjure up memories of some of the great screen couples of the past, actors like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, Myrna Loy and William Powell, who knew what it meant to be movie stars and could convey that larger-than-life quality on screen.These virtues more than compensate for the film's tendency to oversimplify the political and historical issues of the times and for a somewhat disjointed quality in the story's structure. Despite the generally light-hearted tone of the piece, the movie ends on an admirably sober note, showing how what was initially seen as a triumph for American foreign policy might in actuality have been the catalyst for the events that would culminate in 9/11 (the sound of an airliner roaring overhead near the end of the film seems to foreshadow that seminal event).In contrast to some of the year's earlier, more heavy-handed (yet also more substantive) political dramas, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is one social studies lesson that goes down easy - though it should be noted that ""War,"" with its big-name stars, lighter tone and safer, less topical subject matter, earns fewer points for audacity and courage than those others do.",Charlie Wilson's War
38,cherold,Entertaining if somewhat light weight,8,27 December 2008,"I wasn't surprised that a movie directed by Mike Nichols and written by Aaron Sorkin would be smart and entertaining; that's pretty much a given. I was surprised by my enjoyment of Tom Hanks, who thankfully ditched his typically noble characters for someone more interesting; a dissolute congressman who decides to help Afghanistan against the Russians. It's an engaging story and the movie does a solid job of showing the schmoozy nature of international diplomacy. The cast is very good, particular Philip Seymore Hoffman, and like Hanks, Julia Roberts is given a chance to stretch and does a nice job of it.This movie is more entertainment with politics than politics made entertaining, meaning much of the complexity of the situation is tossed out in favor of a pretty straightforward story. But it does work, and it does make a few interesting points, although they are touched on so briefly that the don't have as much impact as they should. All in all, this is a witty, fast-paced movie that is well worth watching.",Charlie Wilson's War
39,Robert_duder,Historical accuracy and controversy aside...it's a very entertaining movie,8,10 January 2008,"I think movies can be a very interesting and educational way to recreate and see history. However I also think when you watch something like this you have to take it with a grain of salt because in all fairness it's only one person's version of a story. I don't know a lot about Charlie Wilson or what he did other than this film and it just seemed a lot of 'too good to be true' really considering that he is painted as a womanizer, alcoholic and potential drug user that had shady connections. Nonetheless the film is very entertaining with some terrific performances and characters. It's hard to go wrong with a first rate cast like this and they all give superb performances. Director Mike Nichols is a very, very versatile director and he's had some really great films and he's had some stinkers but he always creates very intelligent, well developed and very interesting characters. The film is not anti-war per se in a time when we see a lot of those, and it's not pro-war and I really don't think it's trying to address the current situation in Afghanistan although certainly reviewers and movie goers are trying to make something out of it. I think the film makers were simply trying to make a film set nearly thirty years ago about THAT time...not the current situation. Bin Laden is not mentioned nor are the Al Queda, this is about Afghanistan rebels fighting the Russians period.Tom Hanks, probably one of the finest actors alive, takes the title role of Charlie Wilson. He looks terrific and I thought in the trailers that he seemed kind of campy in the part but I was very wrong. His performance is sincere and he balances Charlie Wilson's different sides very well and is terrific. It's more of a subtle performance than the extremes we've seen Hanks do ie: Forrest Gump, or his role in Philadelphia, or Terminal, but it's still a fine performance. Julia Roberts returns to the big screen after a very long absence (more than three years) and for a very good role. She is rich and powerful and has an aura of intelligence about her. She's the whisper in Hanks' ear as far as getting this war under way although her reasons are kind of a mystery. Hanks and Roberts have terrific chemistry together as well. They are both pros and it shows. Philip Seymour Hoffman is sadly underused I thought but still brilliant as tired, and cranky CIA Analyst Gust Avrakotos. His sarcasm and one liners are hilarious and yet his character is deadly serious and very good. He steals the show in many ways and deserves acclaim for his role. Amy Adams has a small but decent role as Charlie Wilson's right hand...woman...and he's obviously picked her for her looks. His entire staff is packed with gorgeous, curvy women but the twist is that they aren't stupid. In fact they are all very intelligent, well spoken and respected by him and they respect him even though it's clear he likes them for various reasons.The character of Charlie Wilson develops well over the course of the film. We see him as a party goer, womanizer, one minded but clearly brilliant and well versed in politics and world issues and we gradually see him take on this very important cause in fighting the Russians. The brilliance of Charlie Wilson's War is also the screenplay penned by Aaron Sorkin who I think is one of the most intelligent writers in Hollywood. He has an amazing way of joking, taking on issues, and creating characters and having it all be the most witty and forceful dialog and scenes. Charlie Wilson's War is very intelligent and well written and documents a very important time in history but is still very entertaining for anyone who doesn't give a lick about the actual story or history. Hanks delivers another terrific movie and I think it's worth seeing although I also think it'll be an Academy shut out despite it's numerous well deserved Globe nominations. 8.5/10",Charlie Wilson's War
40,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A little slow and boring to begin with but stick with it, pay attention and it's a good film",9,14 January 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a typically self-serving US congressman in the early 80s, with a reputation for skirt chasing and high flying lifestyle. But this all starts to change when he strikes up a friendship with the president of Pakistan and subsequently pays a visit to Afghanistan, which is under attack from the Soviet army, sees the suffering of innocent women and children and feels his conscience kick in. He goes on to arrange secret covert weapons shipments to Afganistan to help them fight the Russian oppressors.This is all based on a true story, so it bears some similarities to Schindler's List in a way in it's themes of a flawed man being moved to help a persecuted people. And, while it's nowhere near on that film's level, CWW still manages a decent feat. It suffers from a boring opening, which is a killer for a lot of films that causes some of the audience to walk out before it's even really begun, but use a bit of will-power here, pay attention to everything going on and it pays off in the end.Performances wise, Hanks reliably carries the lead role, managing some convincing emotional scenes, even though his transition from sleazy statesman to righteous people's champion is a bit creakily (for want of a better word) done. Support wise, Phillip Seymour Hoffman provides a sterdy aide to Wilson, as well as some neat comic relief, but Julia Roberts doesn't really cut it as Wilson's wife, a bit forced and chewing off a lot of really unconvincing dialogue.Some have complained the film suffers from a 'schmalzy' ending but I didn't notice this. The only thing I can say about it is that it seemed rather sudden, but this is a good thing as the film doesn't end on a 'hoorah-everything's fine' note but rather one evil being quashed, with another just starting up and remaining unsolved, which is how things tend to be in real life. It's interesting that nothing is mentioned as the Americans train the Afghans to fight how in later life they may have been indirectly responsible for training Osama bin Laden, but it provides a great feeling as the Afghans fire their rockets at the helicopters of the Russian persecutors, giving a great feeling of comeuppance. ****",Charlie Wilson's War
41,ElMaruecan82,When Lao Tseu meets Macchiavelli...,8,14 October 2019,"It's a cliché that many important business decisions are taken during lunchtime, and it's probably true. 'Charlie Wilson's War"" is about a series of decisions, deals and agreements that didn't do much except change the course of history through phone calls, parties and improbable yet successful bargains, as if the trivialities of the world provided the best canvas to history-making decisions.And who'd have thought that this man we see bathing in a Jacuzzi, holding a glass of champagne and surrounded by giggling strippers would do more for his country than what invasions in Cuba, a decade-spanning war in Vietnam and political coups couldn't? I guess this speaks volumes on the way a man's importance can be measured by the effect his decisions have on a geographical area and certain span of time rather than any so-called title. On that level, Charlie Wilson is more historically important than Ronald Reagan and if it wasn't for Mike Nichols' film, his role in the fall of the Soviet regime would have escaped our attention and made his work covert to the end.French politician from the turn of century George Clemenceau said ""war is too important a job to be given to military men"", after watching that diplomatic satire, I couldn't agree more. It seems like the art of winning can pit Lao Tseu's warfare art against the intricate subtleties of diplomacy and make Machiavelli's teachings more relevant. Cynical much? No. Pragmatic, an epithet often been used by historians to describe Lenin's own economical policy and which applies for Wilson. This is a humble congressman who reigns over a Texan district and learned to be friendly and helpful, he doesn't keep a low profile but has no pretension whatsoever to be President material.He knows one thing though, something like the Godfather: the value of friendship, and the way any help pays off sooner or later. What characterizes Charlie Wilson, despite his interest for politics is the way he's totally dispassionate yet professional, it's an interesting departure from Tom Hanks' usually goody-to-shoes roles to see him playing a man who's not an idealist but eager to succeed because that's how he built his reputation on. Of course he's sincerely moved when he visits a refugee camp, but he's a party animal, a womanizer, renown for pretty-looking secretaries with tight corsets and his philosophy of a job is to be able to mix pleasure in it, the kind of man who'd ask Pakistani generals if he could get a glass of whisky; but even when he puts his foot in his mouth, he lands on both.Charlie's talent wouldn't be complete without the help of his assistant (Amy Adams) a rich Christian socialite and romantic interest named Joanne (Julia Roberts) and a CIA agent named Gust played by the so missed scene-stealing Philip Seymour Hoffman. Gust is the kind of guy who's extremely competent but seems condemned to never get the credit he deserves, maybe it's the rough blue-collar looks, the outspoken manners or a certain attitude but it's for these flaws that he gets an instant liking on Charlie. ""You're not James Bond"", says Charlie ""And you're not Thomas Jefferson so call it even"" retorts Gust. Both are outcasts but accessible enough one to another to seal a partnership whose challenge would be to push the Russians out of Afghanistan.The goal is crucial because it would give the Russians their own Vietnam war at a time where the balance was in favor of the West, it would be the overdue deathblow under the Reagan doctrine. But the art of warfare must obey a few principles and in order to make a ""clean"" war, the issue is to destroy the Russian helicopter gunship with a weaponry that couldn't be taken from Americans, which means Russian weapons themseves. Weapon is the key and the found shortcut involves an unlikely partnership between Israel, Egypt and Pakistan, one of these magic tricks that make you wonder if you should applaud the ingenuousness or cry at the tragedy.Sure it's all handled in a lighthearted way and more than the explosion of a Soviet helicopter, the bewildered expression of the missile launchers makes it funny, but behind the laughs, there's a tragedy in march. We all know that the Russian defeat, followed by the fall of the Berlin wall, marked the victory of the liberal world but it's not only near the end that we realize the film was played like a joke without a punchline, but a catch. The mission was clandestine to the point that even the Mujahedeens didn't know who got them the weapons, they'll get back to poverty, cattle and illiteracy. It took billions to give weapons, but a few millions were needed to build schools and hospitals but no one cared about the Afghanistan or any -istan country for that matter, and so the final exchange between Gust and Charlie with the Zen master story foreshadows what would be the Karmic response to the administration's cynicism.Indeed, they were cynical while Wilson and Gust were pragmatic, and it's for attitudes like that that the US policy has often been criticized. The film is like a delicious cake but without the cherry at the end. And what makes so tragic is that none of these lessons have been learned. In 2011, NATO bombed and destroyed Libya through a plan orchestrated by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and philosopher Bernard-Henry Levi, a worse kind of Charlie Wilson. Today, a country is destroyed launching an immigration wave of dramatic results and allowing ISIS to take on the Maghreb.""Charlie Wilson's War"" might be a lighthearted comedy à la ""Wag the Dog"" but It's not that funny watching diplomats playing with matches as they can either burn their fingers or set the whole world in fire. I even hesitate calling it a comedy and that's how brilliant it is.",Charlie Wilson's War
42,paul2001sw-1,A fun film but bad politics,6,19 September 2010,"Charlie Wilson was a relatively liberal Texas congressman who was nonetheless a passionate opponent of communism. He played a significant role in securing funding to aid the Afghani resistance to the Soviet invasion; his private life was wild; and a common theme to both was, at least according to this film about him, the flair and panache with which he discarded the usual rules and played the system to his own ends. Tom Hanks plays the lead; and his partnership with Philip Seymour Hoffman's C.I.A. agent is certainly fun to watch. But I have a number of problems with this film. Firstly, the communist occupation of Afghanistan may have been absolutely a bad thing. This surely doesn't mean that individual Soviet soldiers were personally unsympathetic (as we are shown, presumably so we can celebrate them dying). The sad truth is that for many Afghans, things have never been as good as in the grim days of communism, such has been the chaos and corruption that has followed, arguably fuelled by the supply of weapons by the U.S. to anyone who was willing to kill Russians. This film, which is very kind to Wilson, endorses the idea that he believed in the reconstruction of the country, but that after the cold war ended, no-one wanted to know. This may be partially true, but the belief that a little bit of reconstruction would have been sufficient to pre-empt the current problems is only slightly less naive than the belief that it wasn't necessary. And aside from the rights and wrongs of the Afghan conflict, one might ask, is it really a good thing that the entire direction of U.S. foreign policy was changed by one man with a gift for playing the system? The film seems to suggest it was, because (i) he was right and (ii) he cared. The former is doubtful and the latter the most depressing of Hollywood clichés; even if a good thing was engineered by a skilled operator, in a healthy political system, policy would not be determined by the smartest player. There's always a dangerous temptation, in a house of rogues, to admire the biggest one, whose flair and lack of hypocrisy provide cover for their rottenness; the slimy, self-justifying hypocrites on the margins may be much less appealing types but the greatest damage is done by those who feel no shame. Wilson may not have been evil, and this film argues that he actually did good; but overall, I can't help but feel that the world would be a better place without his kind of politics.",Charlie Wilson's War
43,MOscarbradley,A likable if soft-centered satire,7,1 February 2008,"By now Mike Nichols has rightly earned his stripes. Of course, you could say he earned them on his very first film, the magnificent ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" and then earned them all over again with his second film, ""The Graduate"", taking the Oscar as well. At that time he was the new kid on the block; he's 76 now and has passed from Great White Hope to Old Master, having lost himself a little along the way. But he's back and he's delivering. His television adaptation of ""Angels in America"" is as fine a translation from one medium to another as we've had and his terrific version of ""Closer"" was simply extraordinary.""Charlie Wilson's War"" never quite reaches those dizzy heights. As a satire it's perhaps too soft-centered; as a serious political picture it's too light-weight but it's a smart, likable movie nevertheless, the kind of intelligent entertainment we see all too rarely in the multiplexes. Of course, for that we have to thank Aaron Sorkin as much as Nichols. Sorkin's script, taken from a book by George Crile, is an adroit blend of sentiment and spin. He idolizes Charlie and he makes him a sentimental hero, warts and all, but Sorkin, who devised ""The West Wing"", also has his finger on the political pulse. ""The West Wing"" turned American politics into entertainment for the masses. It could have been ""Dallas"" for the liberal intelligentsia and that comparison isn't lost on Sorkin here. After all, Wilson hails from Texas and Tom Hanks plays him as a cross between JR and Mr Smith, a do-gooder liberal who will break every rule in the book.It also helps he's played by Hanks. He's no longer the boy from ""Big"" but a big, good 'ol boy with bags under his eyes and one too many chins. I've always thought Hanks could be the natural successor to Jimmy Stewart. There is something terribly likable about the man, the embodiment of decent American values and that's how Sorkin and Hanks present Charlie Wilson. Of course, the real thing may have proved a tad more complicated just as the issues here have been simplified. Wilson may not have loved the Russians but until he is taken to an Afghan refugee camp he didn't seem too anxious to get off the fence so whatever his motives or whatever the motives of the US Government who poured a billion dollars into the 'covert' war, the movie boils down to a simple tale of the good guys taking on the bad guys with the good guys coming out on top. I mean, even I felt like cheering when the simple peasant folk shoot down a Russian helicopter.If Hanks is the lynch-pin of the movie, (and it really is a splendid performance), he is surrounded by some very fine players well up on their game: Julia Roberts as the dame with the dough and a few right-wing ideas in her head; an excellent, if under-used, Amy Adams as Hanks' wide-eyed assistant; Ned Beatty as a canny, ageing politico and best of all, Philip Seymour Hoffman as a volatile CIA man who always seems one step ahead of everyone else and who, when it's over, is the first to warn Charlie of the bad times ahead. You see, Charlie Wilson's war is still going on and it isn't funny any more.",Charlie Wilson's War
44,dromasca,a docu-comedy about crossroads of history,5,22 November 2009,"The most amazing thing about this film is that it is based on a true story, and that most if not all the characters are real. The principal question I asked myself during all the screening time was 'G-d, is this really how history was written?'.80s Senator Charlie Wilson is at the peak of his career, influential and looking for good causes to serve. He does not hesitate to live a good life that would make many of his imaginary screen rivals in the James Bond category pale of envy - women, drugs, alcohol - hard to imagine this for a US Representative in an America which was supposed soon to go deep into the moralistic and conservative mood triggered by the Clinton-Lewinski scandal. But the lesser close to reality the better I would say, and the political aspects of the story are really disturbing. The course of Soviet-Afghan war was changed by a bunch of good living characters - idealistic and well intended in their plight of fighting Communism and helping the Afghan people, but politically and culturally illiterate to the extent of asking for a whiskey at the residence of a Moslim president? No wonder no questions were asked about consequences and no thinking seems to have been invested in the day after (the Soviet left Afghanistan) and about and against whom how the remaining stock of arms will be used later.Watching actors like Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman is always a treat. But this is not enough for a solid film about such a serious matter. If the intention of the film was to prove that the American intervention in the 80s was due to pure frivolity then it did succeed. I still like to believe that this film is closer to fantasy than to history.",Charlie Wilson's War
45,MLDinTN,rather bland for a Tom Hanks film,5,3 December 2008,"I'm a big fan of Tom Hanks, but he picked a bad choice in starring in this film. The story was OK, but it wasn't great. Phillip Seymore Hoffman actually had a better role than Hanks. Hanks plays Charlie Wilson, a congressman whom visits Afganistan and sees the poor conditions refugees are living in and the suffering of children, etc.. He wants to help these people beat the invading Soviets. He seeks aid from super rich ex girlfriend Joanne and CIA agent Gust. He's also dealing with his own investigation because he's been accused of using cocaine and like to drink a lot. He uses his wits to get the money he needs to fund weapons to the Afgans. The budget starts at 5 million and at first he wants to get it doubled. The movie shows a couple of years down the line the budget has grown to a billion dollars.The acting was OK, with Hoffman being the best. Hanks southern accent is to over the top. Julia Roberts looks great in this except for the bleach blonde wig.FINAL VERDICT: Not exactly one of the most interesting stories to tell.

46,g-bodyl,A Refreshing Political Comedy!,8,7 November 2014,"Charlie Wilson's War is based off true events which led to the downfall of the Soviet Union and perhaps the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. But instead of making the film a complete political drama, I liked the boldness of the filmmakers by changing the film to more of a political satire. The movie was often funny and it consists of witty, explosive dialogue tanks to the genius writing of Aaron Sorkin. However, I feel that the movie is just way too talkative and the narrative tends to drag on at points.Mike Nichol's film is about a U.S Representative named Charlie Wilson who has been investigated for his party habits. But he pulls his act together by befriending a CIA man in charge of the happenings between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan named Gus. Together along with the help of a rich romantic interest of Charlie, Joanne Herring, they work together to participate in the downfall of the Soviet Union.The acting is really good, as one could expect with this sort of cast. It's weird to see Tom Hanks play a party person, but he pulls it off very well. Julia Roberts is excellent as his cold, rich love interest. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as always, is a great pleasure to watch. Finally, Amy Adams is magnificent as Charlie's assistant, always eager to live up to Charlie.Overall, Charlie Wilson's War is an engaging political satire about the events surrounding the Soviet Union's defeat and it shows how this was truly the beginning of the long drawn-out affair between the Taliban and the United States which would culminate during the 9/11 attacks. But it was funny and the jokes are spot on. The script is unusually clever and it was well-directed by a very well-respected director. Other than some blandness at times, this was a good film.

48,inkblot11,"Just what is going on in Washington, away from the cameras? This fine film gives us a glimpse",7,22 February 2008,"Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks), a congressman from a small corner of Texas, has a penchant for nice-looking women, parties, booze, and even an occasional snort. As he admits, the people in his district want very little, except to be left alone, and this frees him to live the ""high life"" and work on other people's problems. One day, an uber-rich Texas heiress, Joanne (Julia Roberts) asks for his help in the fight against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It seems the Soviets are using helicopters and tanks to ""mow down"" the hapless Afghans, who have very primitive weapons and are fleeing by the thousands into Pakistan. Of course, the United States does have a covert op going, but it is woefully underfunded. Wilson agrees to go to Pakistan to see this situation for himself and he is indeed appalled. With the help of maverick State Department diplomat, Gust (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), Charlie W manages to get weapons and money for the Afghans to shoot down helicopters and blow up tanks. Will the Afghans win before the American public knows what is afoot, especially the billion dollar price tag? This is a fine film about the realities of war and Washington. Wilson is something of a reprobate but he comes through nicely with his earnest desire to help the Afghans defeat the Soviet war machine. But, his covert operations are frightening, since the State Department and the CIA can manipulate whatever world situation they choose to change, without the ordinary American's knowledge. All of the actors, Hanks, Roberts, Amy Adams, and especially Hoffman, are wonderful as the very believable players in the globe's ultimate power struggles. Then, too, the look of the film is gorgeous, as many of the scenes were shot in the wildly beautiful Morocco, while the costumes and art direction recreate the look of the early eighties with skill. Mike Nichols direction is also fine, as he keeps a complex story on track and exciting. If you like political films, are fans of any cast members, or just adore those flicks where the underdog reigns supreme, take a chance on Charlie and company.

The language, the behind the scenes maneuvering, covert ops in the name of liberty and freedom from the red menace all contribute to a fascinating look at the free-wheeling, yet compassionate legacy of one U.S. Congressman, a rich, religious socialite, a knowledgeable CIA veteran employee who flaunted rules and regulations that result a hugely successful effort to thwart the Russian military in Afghanistan. This drama that takes a quality production design incorporates a number of authentic foul language and lavish partying, womanizing lifestyle of the rich and not so famous power-brokers. This theatrical production reminiscent of another Congressional story that was written by Eric Redman's Dance of Legislation (1973) except with more flare and risqué behavior. There is a fun serio-dramatic quality, that at one point is laid on pretty heavy by Tom Hanks and Phillip Seymour Hoffman that it almost becomes fake and artificial. There is also one lost plot point regarding a women imprisoned in Pakistan that becomes a pawn in the attempt to secure funding for a covert war in Afghanistan. Overall, though this different, yet compelling story is delightfully revealing of the unspoken story of Congressional lives and the various colorful characters that may or may not exist in the mysterious corridors of Congressional intrigue. The power of one man is both inspirational as well as frightfully worrisome. The end of the movie is a strong reminder of the loose ends left undone and the lessons, yet not learned to the detriment of the United States and innocent people around the world.

50,The-Sarkologist,An interesting look at the war that brought down the Soviet Empire.,8,25 November 2011,"A friend of mine saw this film back in 2007 and then raved about how good he thought it was. At the time I probably wasn't really interested, but when I was down at the video shop recently (its funny how we still call them video shops despite videos being obsolete) and I decided that I would give it ago. Okay, I found that the DVD itself was scratched which made watching it quite difficult, but it did turn out that my friend was right, this was a really good movie, and I thought it was good enough to add to my Amazon wishlist (I think).Anyway, I probably should mention what this film is about as opposed to some of the incidentals that float around this film. It is about a US congressman (I believe that he is a senator) back in the 1980s. He seems to be one of those congressmen that seem to get elected and once he is elected he simply becomes part of the furniture. He does what he needs to do, and does help out the people of his district, but in the end he appears to be a typical politician (well, actually not really that typical because he was unmarried and a womaniser). We should note this aspect of him, because it is his weakness for women that ended up sending him down the path that he traveled.Now, one might think that the film is about some war that is involved in in Congress, however that is not the case. In fact it is about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and about how Charlie Wilson is dragged into this war (namely being persuaded by a woman). Now which it seemed a good thing to assist a country in repelling an invader, it is generally not that easy, particularly during the cold war where one could not simply give the other side weapons and expect the invaders not to do anything about it. This is something that had happened in the past. Now, Americans generally do not like going to war, they never had. In referring to Americans I am not talking about the ruling elite (they make lots of money from war) but rather the ordinary American citizen. I will not go into the background of this, but it is always something that we need to keep in mind.During World War II, before the US had officially entered the war, they had been funding the Chinese resistance of Japan and this was obvious to the Japanese. The result was that the Japanese wanted to push the United States out of the war permanently, which resulted in the attack on Pearl Harbour, and this officially brought the US into the war. It wasn't Pearl Harbour that gave the US the victory though, but the Battle of Midway, but I digress. Anyway, the concern that was being face here was that if the Soviets got whiff of the assistance that the Americans were giving the Afghanis the it had the potential to turn the cold war into a hot war.The other problem was the balancing of alliances. Israel had always been a strong ally of the US but if the US were to help the Afghanis then they would also need the assistance of some of the surrounding Muslim nations, in particular Pakistan. There was also the question of whether Afghanistan was actually worth protecting, however it became clear that despite the fact that defense of Afghanistan was necessary to prevent the growth of the Soviet empire, it also proved to be a very strategic region, and it appears, on the face of it, that if Afghanistan were to fall then it could start putting pressure of Pakistan, and if Pakistan were to fall, not only would it give the Soviet Union a port on the Indian Ocean, it would also effectively cut the Asian continent in half.However, we do know the outcome, and that is that the Afghanis won and the Soviets were pushed out. Further, after their failure in Afghanistan the Soviet empire was pretty much on its last legs, and collapsed a few years later. While it was not the catalyst of the collapsed (the seeds of its collapse had been sown decades previously) it did play a significant hand. The problem with the Soviet empire was that humans, by nature, are lazy, and when one is paid the same whether they work or not, then most people will chose not to work. However, when the US began to put rocket launchers and anti-aircraft weapons into the hands of the Afghanis then the balance had been tipped in their favour (a little). What the stinger missiles meant was that the Soviets lost their defacto control of their air. When the Afghanis began shooting down their attack choppers and their planes, the war was never going to be the same.Obviously intervention in this war was going to be expensive, and that was where Charlie Wilson played a major role. Sitting on the defense committee he was able to push his agenda towards assisting the Afghanis in fighting off the Soviets. At first the assistance was small, but as the years turned, it grew, and when they began sending in the stingers, the contribution had grown significantly, but it also was one of the events that finally tipped the Soviets over the edge and brought the whole edifice down. Whether it was money well spent is debatable (particularly since once the weapons were in their hands, it became much more difficult to take it out of them again, and further, once the Soviets withdrew there was pretty much a power vacuum left in Afghanistan which produced a civil war which ushered in the Taliban).",Charlie Wilson's War
51,zkonedog,"Could Have Been Epic, But Instead Was Just Interesting",6,11 March 2017,"Political films are some of the hardest in Hollywood to pull off smoothly. Either the subject matter is too controversial, it paints someone in too positive/negative of a light, or it flat out messes with history to fit a dramatic tone. ""Charlie Wilson's War"" suffered from none of these problems, yet still managed to underwhelm due to a completely unexpected source: it couldn't decided whether it wanted to be gripping, or a farce.Basically, this movie tells the story of U.S. Senator Charles Wilson, who (during the Soviet- Afghanistan conflict) was so inspired by the courage of the Afghan troops in fending off the Russians that he launched a covert ""campaign"" of sorts to get the Afghans the funding/weapons they needed to defeat the spread of Communism from the Soviets. As history bears out, Wilson succeeds in this task and is regarded as a hero...at least for the time being.This entire film could have taken (and would have been much better off, in my opinion) a more serious tact to the political issues being dealt with, like the lack of funding to an Afghanistan ""military"" that was essentially fighting the Soviets for the United States, or the fact that Afghanistan went on to produce the terrorists that perpetuated 9/11 and we are now fighting. This approach could have been a great sort of dramatic ""treatise"" on those issues and could have made people really think about them.Unfortunately, the film does not take that sort of tone, and instead focuses on the character of Charlie Wilson. While obviously at the center of all the goings-on, this prolonged focus on Wilson's personality and private life only served to drag the film down. Plus, all the characters (but essentially Tom Hanks' Wilson and his lady-friend played by Julia Roberts) seem way too over the top in their interactions with each other and the plot at hand. I realize the intent of the filmmakers, which was to show what a maverick Charles Wilson really was, but to me that wasn't the most interesting part of the story.Thus, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is a respectable film dealing with an interesting political event, yet views those happenings through a prism (the crazy Wilson) that isn't altogether engaging. While the focus on the Afghan-Soviet conflict is refreshing (not just World War 2 or terrorism), it isn't played for the type of drama that could have occurred. Involved political minds will find it interesting, while lesser scribes may drift off as the message gets lost in Hanks' over-the-top portrayal of Wilson.",Charlie Wilson's War
52,johnnyboyz,An intriguing and at times powerful film about one man's attempt to balance his own life as well as defend the rights of other people's.,8,14 November 2008,"Charlie Wilson's War might make for a fascinating film viewing experience if it were seen back-to-back with 1988's The Beast of War, a film all about Afghan rebels fighting a lone Soviet tank in the Afghan mountains. In which order you'd see the films would raise an interesting debate; perhaps if you saw two thirds of Charlie Wilson's War and then The Beast of War in its entirety and then the final third of the recent Tom Hanks vehicle, you might get quite a feeling for the conflict that arose in the 1980s between the Afghan people and invading Soviet troops. But as a film on its own, Charlie Wilson's War pushes all the right buttons and presents us with a story about a fight; not necessarily a fight on the battlefield but a fight picked by a man who can create the battlefield, or at least ensure the battlefield is level headed.My favourite scene or running joke in Charlie Wilson's War is when Charlie Wilson himself (Hanks) meets up with some Middle-East higher ups to discuss America's aid in the ongoing crisis with the Soviet troops. They bicker over the amount of money America have put into the fight; it was $5 Million but was since doubled to ten million  Charlie, like us, assumes this to be more than enough to which the higher-ups laugh in ironic disapproval. Later on, they review the figure following several victories over the Soviets thanks to the funding and the amount of dollars has risen quite considerably. Charlie laughs with them the second time around because he now sees why the first figure of ten million was so useless. It's a moment that captures perfectly the ignorance towards a certain situation we could all have nothing to do with if we so chose. But we, like Charlie, come to learn of the predicament and understand what the Afghanis face and what they need to defeat the enemy.But the film is more than 'build up the enemy and knock them back down again for a cheap thrill. Indeed, a recent film of a political nature that may be more akin to this set up is the recent 'Rambo' picture which offers nothing but blood and guts as we might get an adrenaline rush out of seeing these evil, faceless bad guys get their comeuppance. Charlie Wilson's War starts out in an expensive looking hotel room as the hero of the title sits in a Jacuzzi amid topless women and cocaine addicts. News of the Soviet Union's involvements in Afghanistan comes through and he is the only one to show any interest, even demanding it be turned up so he can hear properly, much to the confusion of some of the others who wonder why he even bothers.But it's interesting how the film feels so bold enough to present Charlie Wilson as such a womaniser. The opening scene in the penthouse may juxtapose interests amongst individuals seeing that there cannot be too many individuals whom hang about with cocaine addicts and loose women whilst displaying an imminent interest in foreign affairs. The idea or tactic to further confuse the audience or create some sort of clashed opinion is done later on when a scenario involving the apparent imminent sex with a woman in his apartment is juxtaposed with several, thick books all over the tables and shelves to do with world history, particularly World War Two. This sort of set up or clashing of typical codes and conventions is maybe more akin to a film such as American Psycho in which the lead character is involved in an apartment of his own; complete with two call girls but in addition to deep and complicated verbal insights into various musical artists from the 1980s.But that's not to say the two characters share any similarity in mental condition. Wilson may have his office fully inhabited by employed women and he may well be seen in certain scenarios like the one mentioned but we get the feeling he is a patriot and we get the feeling that deep down, he just wants equality and what's right. By the time the scene has arrived to do with a supposed drug scandal involving Wilson in relation to the very first scene, we are perhaps feeling the heat ourselves  maybe we want him to get away with it. It's quite an achievement from director Mike Nichols to be able to blend in these scenes, feelings and clashed content and yet still manages to pull of a satisfying film experience.In reference to the meat of the film, Wilson will encounter Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gust Avrakotos who is doing all he can for the Afghans as it is with the CIA. Complete with Michael Vickers (Denham), whose first scene presents him being able to play four games of chess at once, Wilson and co. put together an aid effort for the fighting Afghans that, by the time their potential victory arrives, is actually quite humbling even if it gets there through presenting the Soviets as bloodthirsty airmen calmly doing their job as they massacre thousands. It would be interesting to review the Russian reception had that one dialogue scene between the three choppers been completely cut. It's quite daring of all involved to have made this film given the state of the world we're currently in and given how it wants us to sympathise with the Afghans, but it's a success all the same about a conflict rarely depicted on screen and a scenario that led to more harrowing events.",Charlie Wilson's War
53,filipemanuelneto,"An interesting film, in which the hypocrisy of politics is skillfully exploited.",6,12 July 2021,"This movie is difficult to assess. At first, it seems like a kind of satire on American politics, where an American congressman, in a totally improbable way, will play a decisive role in the development of one of the most important conflicts of the end of the 20th century: the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.In fact, Texan Charles Wilson is the most unlikely congressman for a situation that was both delicate and risky for the US: at the beginning of the film, we see him having fun with women, alcohol and drugs, and the way he looks be irresponsible, just another politician living off taxpayers. However, he will be able to handle the situation in Afghanistan and be the right man for the task, funding through the CIA the guerrillas who held the Russians back. In real life, he served in Congress between 1973 and 1997, and his actual contribution to the events reported here is, to say the least, debatable. However, the film was able to take advantage of George Crile's biographical book and make a good story out of that material, where Americans do what they have to do, look after their interests, regardless of what happens in the country of others. Yes, the chaos and human drama of the Afghans is just collateral damage and nothing more.Tom Hanks is a very good master of the film and is excellent at the work ahead. It's not his best movie, and I think the actor is within a certain comfort zone here, without challenging himself too much, but it's a positive performance. Julia Roberts also did well, especially when she starred with Hanks. She hasn't been around much and seems to have had some bad luck along the way, but participating in this film was the actress's right choice. Seymour Hoffman had a sympathetic role in this film, playing the role of a sarcastic veteran spy, who becomes adorable in our eyes for the realistic and harsh way he looks at his surroundings. Even though I got famous with ""Capote"", it's in this movie that I feel Hoffman really shows his worth.Technically, the film is very good and has good production values, but it doesn't stand out, it lets the story and cast stand out. The cinematography is good and makes interesting use of a lot of old footage, and while the film isn't always happy about making us feel that this story takes place in the 80s (the sets and costumes sometimes seem undated), it will. Being overtaken by the recurring mention of characters and events from that time. The soundtrack is good and plays its part discreetly.",Charlie Wilson's War
54,howard.schumann,Does not tell us some very salient facts,8,29 June 2008,"Based on a best-selling book by George Crile, Mike Nichols' Charlie Wilson's War is a sharp political satire that suggests that an alcoholic, womanizing Texas politician was mainly responsible for the defeat of the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s, a defeat that led to the end of the Cold War. With a witty and literate screenplay by Aaron Sorkin of West Wing fame, the film stars the great Tom Hanks as the playboy Congressman who teems up with an extreme right-wing socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), and a maverick CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to secure the money and weapons necessary to conduct a covert war against Soviet tanks and missiles in Afghanistan. It is a wild and entertaining ride with a lot of anti-communism and some tacked on warnings at the end but the film slides past the true nature of the operation and the characters involved.Charlie Wilson's War begins in the 1990s when Rep.Wilson is being honored by the CIA for his role in the enhancing the defeat and break-up of the Soviet Union. According to the film, Wilson ostensibly learns about the Soviet invasion by watching Dan Rather on CBS News while soaking in a hot tub in Las Vegas, surrounded by attractive women. Using his Texas connection with Herring, Wilson is able to connect with President Zia (Om Puri) of Pakistan people as well as others in power around the world with the help of Avrakotos. Hoffman, as the world-weary abrasive CIA agent steals every scene he is in but, unfortunately, Julia Roberts leaves us wondering why she was cast in the role she seems not to be suited for.After being moved by visiting Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan, Charlie and Gust organize conspiratorial dealings with Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Israel to secure Soviet-made weapons stashed in Israel so that the world will never know that the U.S. is involved. Dodging charges of cocaine use brought by Rudy Guiliani in a federal investigation Wilson uses his position on the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee to obtain the required money. Eventually the United States, the UK and Saudi Arabia became major financial contributors, the United States donating $600 million in aid per year, with a matching amount coming from the Gulf States. Of course, we know the adventure though successful militarily came at a cost.The ultimate folly of the undertaking was that the very fighters we armed in the early 80s turned into the America-hating fundamentalist Islamic Jihad movement of the last decade. This is mentioned in a coda that tells us that the U.S. failed the ""end game"" by not authorizing the resources to rebuild Afghanistan after the war, but the message of caution seems lost in the overall glee of the film's triumphalism. While Nichols' effort casts a smart and cynical eye on the behind the scenes wheeling and dealing of our elected representatives and the intelligence community, the film does not tell us some very salient facts.Not mentioned in the film is that President Jimmy Carter armed the Mujahedeen to attempt to overthrow the Socialist government of Kabul long before Wilson emerged from his hot tub, that the charming Wilson was a strong supporter of dictators including Nicaraguan strongman Anastasio Somoza, that the lovable Avrakotos helped to replace a democratically-elected government in Greece with a military junta, and that Avrakotos' boss, CIA Director William Casey, organized U.S. special forces to teach the Pakistanis the art of car bombing which was conveyed to the Mujahedeen. Along with the rise of the Taliban and the emergence of Osama Bin Laden, we are still paying the price for Charlie Wilson's War.",Charlie Wilson's War
55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Perfect timing for a political drama,8,11 February 2009,"Books and films about the past are often made because they resonate with the time in which they are published or released. No example is more fitting than ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" which shows how what was once a great--albeit covert--American success in Afghanistan in the 1980s had far-reaching consequences that we deal with today. It's a film that teaches us to be mindful of the past and to be conscious of how our current actions might affect the future.Director Mike Nichols, though certainly a capable director, doesn't do much to add to this film. This is writer's film -- a great screenplay delivered by West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin. Clearly there's no arguing he's got the credentials to deliver ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" originally a book by George Crile. It's smart, witty, intellectual and there's plenty of spice mixed in. Then of course you have incredible talents delivering the script: a writer can't ask for better than Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.The film centers on Texas congressman Charlie Wilson, a whiskey-drinking womanizer who doesn't claim to be anything else. He's a paragon of the immoral politician and this sets him up to be not only a great character, but someone who will certainly learn a thing or two. Hanks gives him the perfect dose of Southern charm to woo you away from dwelling on his sexist behavior and questionable politics. Somehow, Charlie is raptured by what he sees going on in Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union has been unleashing air attacks. With the influences of a wealthy Houston woman (Roberts), Charlie manages to increase funding for countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan to defend themselves. With the help of the CIA and agent Gust Avrakotos (Hoffman), he is able to keep it quiet so that the country doesn't even know that it's really fighting a war.Since this is a political drama, there's a lot of talking, which makes the characters even more critical. In addition to Hanks, Hoffman provides some comic relief with his character's quick temper and foul mouth. It's just what a film with no action needs to stay interesting. The 90 minutes length is also helpful.What makes this film go from good to very good is the knowledge that the viewer brings in. Twenty years from now this might not make an impact on your average viewer with no sense of today's War in Afghanistan. Knowing that arming these countries with weapons to fight Communism was going to come back and bite us in the form or our own war with these countries makes the process of how Wilson went about this all the more interesting.",Charlie Wilson's War
56,jzappa,The Worst Mike Nichols Film I Have Yet To See,6,18 May 2008,"Mike Nichols being an exceptionally able and inspiring director, one could've safely expected a lot out of Charlie Wilson's War, and I, having done so, can safely feel disappointed. Its few and hardly consequential high points include Philip Seymour Hoffman's scene-stealing, rising high above the average of the rest of the cast, of which one could have also felt assured. Hoffman dominates the only successful scene in the film, which happens to be the introduction of his character.Another of the pros is that, as a politically themed film based on a true story, younger people can understand it and learn from it because it's not a jargon movie like, say, Syriana, which though it's a better movie than Charlie Wilson's is like trying to complete several jigsaw puzzles at once.This movie is a disappointment because it's bogged down by a massive overdose of hero worship. Charlie Wilson is too much of a maverick superman, designed for the cocky likes of Tom Hanks to play as hero for whom the audience should cheer every time he suddenly breaks his fun-loving facade and reveals a serious and profoundly righteous side, standing up against government officials. His weaknesses are supposed to appear as a quantitative overwhelming in opposition to the quality overpowering of his sense of honor, morality and justice. What an effective and moving portrait this would be if all of his vices were portrayed as likable and funny. He drinks around the clock, occasionally snorts some coke at parties loaded with bare-breasted and nubile bimbos, and womanizes in a way that women find exciting behind their eye-rolling, to the point where Julia Roberts, playing a politician's cold and domineering wife is having an affair with him that we're not supposed to think anything of. For a movie that criticizes America's betrayal of the world's reality, it surely does not mind bloating itself with schmaltzy all-American bluster and wet dreams.This screaming misnomer on Nichols's record manages not to avoid a consistent weakness found mainly in the middle of his career with Postcards From the Edge, Silkwood, and Working Girl, which is an ending that results in a blink of surprise followed by a whipping of the wrist to calculate the movie's running time via one's watch. After a little over a decade of stunning work that is quite well-paced, harking back to his earliest greats from the late 1960s and '70s, he reprises with a movie that is anti-climactic, in way too much of a hurry to end. This might be the worst case of Nichols's directorial weakness, because I left feeling a gap in the experience, the gap being in the form of a plot swaggering along the path of least possible resistance. There is no conflict that builds any suspense. The trouble the heroes go through to achieve their goal is not portrayed very prominently, whereas in Nichols's earlier political commentary, Primary Colors, is staggeringly powerful, giving us many moments that look like brick walls until the subsequent scenes.Charlie Wilson's War, on the other hand, smacks of a hurry, riding roughshod over its audience. The film, frankly, doesn't even look very good, which is a major point of betrayal for me from Nichols, because the visual style he applied to The Graduate had such a great impact upon me. Here, aside from his dull and sometimes awkward composition, the special effects are bad what with miniature shots of helicopter explosions.Woe is me.",Charlie Wilson's War
57,robert-temple-1,Destroying the Soviet Union in his spare time,9,25 June 2008,"This is a fascinating film, well made as it would have to be, coming from Mike Nichols. I had never heard of Congressman Charlie Wilson before, nor known anything of this story, most or all of which is said to be true and probably is. Tom Hanks does a superb job of portraying 'Good Time Charlie', as he was known then, who was a true 'good ole boy' as the Washington Congressman for the Second District of Texas (the district where all the good ole boys live, with their cans of beer in one hand, one hand on the wheel, and the third hand on the gal beside them). However, Tom is getting a bit stocky, and those of us who love him don't want all that impish character driven out of his face, so whooa boy with those cheeseburgers. The real Wilson must have been a bit more of a redneck, but Hanks's interpretation more than fills the bill. Strange to see Philip Seymour Hoffman with hair dyed dark, but then that's what you have to do when you play a Greek. Naturally, he pulls it off very well as an iconoclastic CIA man who hates bureaucrats and pussyfooting around. The troubling thing about the casting here is Julia Roberts. She has done many a fine performance in her time, but this was not a part for her. I always find her alarming anyway, as she needs the opposite of botox, whatever that might be, or to persuade her plastic surgeon to do a mouth reduction job. There really ought to be liposuction for lips, dontchathink? Anyway, I don't know how all those screen actors have survived kissing Julia Roberts on screen because surely they would slide down her throat and end up sitting there for days undigested, owing to the fact that she probably never eats anything. Well, I guess that's her sorted out. The only person with a bigger mouth is Cherie Blair, and hers is square, which is worse, of course. Now for the film. What an amazing tale! Here we have a good ole boy who changes the history of the world without really trying. I always knew the House Appropriations Committee was powerful, but I never knew a guy with several secretaries on his lap at once could put hundreds of millions through in between fondling his staff. I don't know quite what that says about world affairs, but it is at least something to ponder. All that money to arm the radical Islamists whom we are now fighting! On the other hand, it did bring down the Soviet Union. This is almost too wild a tale to believe, but the man clearly did earn his 'Honored Comrade' award from the CIA with which the film begins. One is tempted to say 'Only in America!', but in fact it was really 'Only in Afghanistan'! Or both! The pathetic station chief in Kabul who 'doesn't want to call attention' is all too typical of bureaucrats in every government. I notice on IMDb that lots of irate ex-Soviet soldiers have written in protesting against this film. There is nothing like getting a Speznaz veteran riled! Somebody has surely pressed some buttons here, not the red one, but the lesser ones. Maybe we all ought to go out to the Second District of Texas and have a look at the people there and see how they make 'em that way. This kind of thing doesn't happen every day, and it was well worth recording in a big Hollywood movie for all the world, even those who live in 'the Russian Federation' as they call it now, to see and ponder.",Charlie Wilson's War
58,Turfseer,Interesting history/Weak Drama,5,13 January 2008,"There's not a lot to say about this film. I wonder if it would have been better as a History Channel Documentary. Certainly the basic historical facts keep one's interest throughout the film. The details of ""Charlie Wilson's War"" are little known and this movie will enlighten you. But as far as a drama is concerned, the story is flat. What's missing is a central antagonist who Charlie must go up against. In a sense, it's the Washington establishment's 'indifference' that Charlie must take a stand against. But there's no one human central face who Charlie will oppose THROUGHOUT the film. Hence, the story has a weak arc. What's more, despite the moral lapses with the opposite sex, the portrait of Charlie is one of a hagiography. Tom Hanks does all he can to place his main character on a pedestal and that also detracts from the drama. After seeing this film about two weeks ago, I can remember little about it. If you're into history, check this film out. If drama is your forte, skip it!",Charlie Wilson's War
59,Chris Knipp,"Win the war, lose the country",8,25 December 2007,"Charlie Wilson's War is a slice of American foreign policy--American interventionism, actually--seen (because this time it really was) as the work of a single Congressman. It's been called ""a history lesson"" and ""a cautionary tale."" The warnings are only tucked in hastily in the end, and no ""history lesson"" so greatly limits its context. Nonetheless, enjoyable as the show is, it's above all instructive. It's the way Stephen Gaghan's Syriana would have been if it had a tidier structure and made more sense. Despite the emphasis on glossy personalities, there's a lot of fast, smart political analysis of how things get done when you want to win a little war on the sly against a big enemy for a little country.Nichol's film is based on a book by the late CBS correspondent George Crile--and that's Crile's title, not a jazzed-up movie version. The screen adapter is Aaron Sorkin of TV's ""The West Wing,"" a master at swiftly blocking in the machinations of top-level politicos.This is a story of people making a big splash momentarily on the world scene, and for it Nichols has enlisted three big American film stars: Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Some commentators wish they played even bigger; that Julia had had a bit more fun and that Tom was as histrionic as an old -time southern politician. But they do okay: Julia can't be Erin Brokovitch every time; Wilson wasn't the old-time kind. What Hanks conveys is a look of mellowness and overindulgence.Hoffman plays a wildly independent and outspoken CIA man who becomes Wilson's ally. He's convincing too, and yes, he does tend to steal most of the scenes he's in, while we're constantly saying to ourselves how he almost doesn't look like Philip Seymour Hoffman: he's hiding behind tinted lenses and black dyed hair as Gust Avrakotos, a man of Greek descent, who hasn't been doing much and thinks most of his bureau chiefs are idiots.Hanks' character is a Texas Congressman who's on two important committees, but so deeply in love with women and booze that it raises a potential scandal, and he justifiably addresses his cleavage-heavy office staff members collectively as ""jailbait."" In 1979, the Soviets are invading Afghanistan, and Congress is offering the Afghans only a pittance to defend themselves. If the Cold War means anything, Wilson reasons, we ought to stop the Russians in their tracks.This movie earns constant points for depicting how things get done in Congress, the deals, the extra doubled allocations hidden in a bill. This war of Charlie's is a secret war, the biggest ever. He increases the funding from $5 million to $1 billion, and works through Israel, Pakistan, the Saudis, the Egyptians, strange bedfellows who all stood to gain from keeping the Russians back. Through CIA operatives arranged by Avrakotos, Russian weapons are delivered to the Afghan resistance fighters, the mujahidin (which Charlie learns means ""holy warriors""--but this was twenty years before 9/11), to bring down Soviet planes and helicopters without revealing an American presence. Wilson is spurred on by a Houston socialite who, despite being a Christian fundamentalist, is working to strengthen the Pakistanis. They of course, are more eager to turn back the Russians than anybody and have the closest stake in Afghanistan. Charlie persuades some of his Congressional colleagues to join his side by taking them to the Afghan refugee camp where he realized the atrocities being committed to the Afghans by the Russian invaders.Wilson wins his war: the Soviets are turned back. Maybe this contributes to the fall of the Soviet Union. Charlie gets a special award from the clandestine services for his initiative. But as a closing caption quotes the Congressman as saying, though things had turned out fabulously well, in the aftermath ""we f----d up."" Indeed: the mujahidin turned out to include Al Qaeda and the Taliban.Mike Nichols has dealt with politics and war interestingly before--Catch-22, Postcards from the Edge, Primary Colors, but he's more at home in the drawing room than on the battlefield. Here, politics seems above all to be the raw material for the acting gambits, the fun sparring between Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman in a room. Wilson calls Afghanistan ""just a pile of rocks"" at one point. The sex between Hanks and Roberts, which is part of our, and Wilson's, introduction to the Afghan-Pakistan dilemma, isn't any more real than the politics. The scenes of aerial battling and desert skirmishing can't be taken very seriously and could have been done overnight at Cinecitta.But the insider stuff is very suggestive. Mike Vickers, played by Steppenwolf Theater actor Christopher Denham, was a young but talented man who Avrakatos put in charge of the covert operation, and he's still a special ops chief for the CIA. When he's first enlisted in ""Wilson's war,"" Vickers is playing simultaneous chess games. It's a good metaphor: the Afghan war is a war game, and only one of many. Though the refugees and the kids with missing limbs and disfigurements are real to Wilson, the lesson of this movie is how Americans habitually fail to see the larger picture when they engage in manipulations of world politics. You can have a dramatic effect sometimes by injecting large quantities of money and arms into a situation, but it's the follow-up that counts. And you can't control a whole region by tweaking a few events.Charlie Wilson's War is a movie that's grown-up, relevant, and smart. It's's not a great movie but it makes you think, and that's all too rare.",Charlie Wilson's War
60,thinker1691,""" I'm told, I'm someone with Character flaws, by a man who murdered his predecessor """,10,2 September 2009,"When you watch this film, you'll easily detect the crisp gunfire dialog between the characters. It is an audible trademark made popular by writer Aaron Sorkin. The movie is called "" Charlie Wilson War "" and based on the real-life Congressman from Texas. Actor Tom Hanks plays Charlie Wilson, a self-inflating, drug addicted, boozing, skirt-chasing Democratic Represenative from the Lone Star state. Wilson is watching the CBS Evening News one night when noted anchorman Dan rather is sending a live report from Afganistan. Listening, he hears the Afgan militia are being slaughtered by the invading Russian Army. In his patriotic zeal, he decided to do everything in his power to provide the Afgan fighters with sophisticated military weapons to drive the Russians out of the country. Teaming up with an experienced but rogue C.I.A. Operative named Gust Avrakotos (Philip Hoffman), Wilson will lie, cheat, steal and mis-appropriate U.S. monies, to provide those needed weapons. Like most idealists, Wilson doesn't think his plan through, but does sleep with rich whores, lies to conniving Isreali, Packistani, Egyptian and U.S. diplomatic Officials to create support for his project. No one explains to him what happens when one creates an animal to kill an enemy. Failing to retrain said creation, it becomes a threat to one's own future and attacks America on 911. Charlie is not alone in his crime. He is helped by wealthy and influential socialites and equally naive congressmen, religious leaders and ambivalent political leaders fighting a decaying Soviet Union. Revelling the outcome, they celebrate when Russia is defeated and a new world threat is created. Seen by many as a hero, Charlie Wilson and men like him realize too late that funding destructive wars is much easier than creating a school system which can promote the ideals of peace. The movie should be a wake-up call for anyone thinking, that Russians fighting Afgans is different than Americans fighting Afgans. An excellent film and sure to become a educational Classic. ****",Charlie Wilson's War
61,freemantle_uk,Good Political Dramady,8,28 November 2009,"Aaron Sorkin is great, he is a brilliant writer of plays, films and TV shows, giving the world A Few Good Men, The American President, Studio 60 On the Sunset Strip, and his greatest creation The West Wing. He is a writer who can mix comedy and drama effectively, and tackles areas that truly interest him. Sorkin, with a good director, tackle a political subject of the 80s, about the unique story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, who ensured money, arms and training went to the Mujahideen to combat the Soviet Invasion.Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) was a Democratic congressman from Texas, who as he states has the easiest congressional district in Congress. He is able to make friends and deals. He also enjoys a party live style, spending time with a lot of women, drinks a lot and has been known to use cocaine occasionally. He office is staffed with young attractive women and he enjoys the fact he could pretty much do whatever he wants: until he gets investigated by Rudy Giuliani. Charlie ends up getting interested in the war in Afghanistan, seeing that the fighters are struggling against the Soviets. The covert budget for the war is only $5 million dollars, and they is no CIA strategy. One officer even wants to just use Afghans to bleed the Soviets as pay back for Vietnam. Charlie quickly raises money and makes contacts with the Pakistani government. Charlie ends up forming an unholy alliance with CIA operative Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a crass European specialist who suffers anger issues, and Joanne Herring (Julie Roberts), a very wealthy right wing woman who campaigns and raises money for the fight against Communism. Charlie and Gust were able to raise money, and form a strategy involving Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to get weapons into Afghanistan, and Charlie uses all his political knowledge to ensure Congress and the American government backs him. I also like to mention that it Afghanistan wasn't the only reason why the Soviet Union fell. There is Mikhail Gorbachev domestic reforms, Glasnoth and Perestroika (or as I like to call Democray and Captailism), the Soviet Union pulling out of Eastern Europe. And finally Ronald Regean's policy of plowing money into pointless defence projects like Star Wars and leading admirals buying golden toilet seats. The Soveits weren't able to keep up, and Regean was able to mess up two countries, America and Russia.As a West Wing fan, I was always going to be interested in the film, and Charlie Wilson's War does pay a little like that. This is true involving Charlie's political dealings. There are elements like conversations involving Afghanistan, it's effects and why Charlie got interested in politics. It can be easily read as a commentary about Afghanstan, then and now. Aaron Sorkin plans the film mostly as a drama, but there are excellent witty moments. Philip Seymour Hoffman has the best moments, and he is a great performance; I could watch him read the phonebook for an hour and an half and be entertained. Tom Hanks is also good as Charlie Wilson who turns from playboy to professional politician. The director Mike Nichols, is a seasoned director, showing he can do both comedy (The Graduate), drama (Closer), an interest in politics (Primacy Colors) and get best from his actors. He handles the material well, allowing jokes to shine, but lets to the become more serious. He builds the tone, and this is a film aimed at adults. If you are going to watch this film you will need to know about a little about the history, and how it affects the world today. I am personally interested in the subject. A little footnote though, the Mujahideen never liked the Americans in the first place, only using them for weapons. America was always the great Satan, but they toned that element down during the war.This is a more right wing screenplay by Sorkin. He tries to be even handed towards the left and the right in the America, and shows a very unflattering view of the Soviet cinema. I recommend watching 9th Company to balance things out. But there is the theme that America are good at winning wars, but bad at winning the peace.A good enjoyable little film.",Charlie Wilson's War
62,dfranzen70,"Inconsequential, but not without some charm",6,23 December 2007,"Charlie Wilson's War is based on real-life events, but that doesn't mean it's awesomely compelling. Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) an almost-invisible Congressman in the 1980s who specializes in drinking and carousing, decides to push for the U.S. to aid the Afghanis, whose country has been invaded by the Soviet Union. Only they had to do it secret-like, you see, because the Cold War was ongoing at the time. Couldn't have the Russkies knowing we were arming their enemies, because then we'd be directly involved when we wanted to remain indirectly involved. You know, because of the nukes.Wilson can't pull this off alone, of course, even if he's the chairman of the committee that funds the CIA's covert ops. The cool thing is that if Wilson asks for the budget to be increased, say, twofold, Congress sees only the amount, not the reasons underlying the increase. Even so, Wilson needs to schmooze and raise funds without blowing the cover; he's pushed and prodded into action by a woman who can help him, wealthy Texas socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts). Herring, a devout Christian, wants to help the Afghani mujahedin to push back against the godless Communist invaders. Rounding out the team is the CIA's own rogue renegade rebel, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an iconoclast with the intelligence - if not the social graces - to help Wilson win his war.Hanks turns in a pretty believable Texas twang and is a pretty good fit for the role, even when he uses profanity. I can't remember the last time I heard Tom Hanks say the F word or be in a hot tub with naked women. Oh, wait, it might have been Bachelor Party. Somehow, even the older Hanks pulls it off. Then there's Roberts, who's also somewhat acceptable in her role as the Texan matron - but who must have had an on-set stylist who absolutely detested her, because she got put in some of the worst wigs known to women. (Men in general have worse wigs, obviously.) I mean, it looked like a blonde muskrat died on her head. I shouldn't be too unkind, since the movie IS set in the 1980s, a decade infamous for its fashion choices, but the look was really awful for Roberts. And, as I mentioned, she's somewhat acceptable - if one looks past the fact that she's 40 playing someone considerably older but still looking like a 40 year old playing dress up.Outshining everyone, easily, was Hoffman. It's like the man doesn't even have to break a sweat to outact people anymore. He's even better than Hanks, who's kind of restricted by the type of role that Charlie Wilson is - a fun-lovin' Man in Charge. Supporting characters, like Hoffman's Gust, often have more freedom to be wacky, offbeat, lovable curmudgeons. Hoffman's fantastic, hidden beneath Gust's bushy mustache and issuing bon mots; he steals the movie from the bigger stars (Oscar win notwithstanding) with a grumpy, energetic performance.All in all, Charlie Wilson's war is simply okay, a decent biopic about a man and situation unfamiliar to most people. It's helped quite a bit by its superstar cast (and direction by Mike Nichols), but it's not interesting enough to warrant much attention. When Hanks, Roberts, and Hoffman have retired from acting, this movie will appear only as a blip, a footnote in otherwise memorable careers.",Charlie Wilson's War
63,PWNYCNY,Ugh! This is Julia Roberts' worst movie.,1,21 January 2008,"Has Hollywood forgotten that the Cold War is over? That Russia is not the enemy? That the Soviet Union was fighting the groups who today are our enemies ... who hate us ... who call us infidels and other vile names ... and who we're now fighting in Afghanistan? If anything, we should have helped the Russians fight those maniacs posing as so-called freedom fighters. Under the pretext of telling a story about an unknown alcoholic, glib politician who miraculously develops a sense of duty to humanity ... while in a hot-tub with coke-snorting prostitutes ... this movie takes direct aim at the Soviet Union (i.e. the Russians). How dumb is that? Russia as the enemy? Duh! Oh, they were communists? Was that the problem? If this movie is some kind of anti-commie tirade, then the movie is way too late. There's no more Soviet Union! Everybody happy now? Is the world now a better, safer place? After the events of September 11, 2001, any country that attacks those groups that hate us and want to harm us is our allie. We would have been a lot better off if we had let the Russians stay in Afghanistan. Better them than us having to fight those criminal fanatics. Bashing the Soviet Union over their intervention in Afghanistan, which borders in their country, would be like bashing the Soviet Union for their actions in the Battle of Berlin in the closing days of World War Two. If the Soviets had not been willing to administer the final coup-de-grace against the Germans, WE would have had to do it and who knows how many thousands of American soldiers would have been lost. That we actually covertly aided and abetted groups in Afghanistan that openly hate us is absolutely amazing. Ugh!Also, neither Tom Hanks or Julia Roberts are particularly believable in this movie. Tom Hanks as a corrupt, alcoholic Texas Congressman? I don't think so. Julia Roberts as a rich Texas Southern Baptist trying to sound like a female Lyndon Johnson? I don't think so. If the movie works for you, fine. But any movie that rags on the Russians is just missing the point. Russia is not the enemy, and while they were involved in Afghanistan, neither was the Soviet Union.Whose idea was it to make the incredibly beautiful Julia Roberts look like a grotesque, overly made-up, two-bit hooker?Does Charlie Wilson EVER stop drinking?By the way, I wonder how we would like it if certain radical groups were located right across our border. In 1962 we were ready to start a nuclear war over the presence of missiles in Cuba, and Cuba doesn't even border on the United States. So why should the Soviet Union have acted any differently? And now that we have troops and helicopters in Afghanistan, do you think the Russians are now willing to help us?",Charlie Wilson's War
64,drqshadow-reviews,"Excellent Conversations, Unflinching Perspective",8,23 August 2011,"A Cliff's Notes version of America's involvement in the Afghan / Soviet war during the mid '80s, this covers quite a bit of ground in a relatively short amount of time. Tom Hanks's Charlie Wilson is a charismatic, entertaining character with the ever-present political gift of gab, but he's upstaged every time he shares the screen with Philip Seymour Hoffman's thick-spectacled CIA op, Gust Avrakotos. The two make for a dynamite pair that can cover extremely deep, complicated topics in casual conversation without seeming overly technical or dull; a major risk in a film that spends so much time behind closed doors in Washington. Julia Roberts can't even begin to keep up with her two co-stars, and makes for an uncomfortable fit when she's crammed into their scenes together.

66,Chris_Docker,A challenging comedy for intelligent adults,8,11 February 2008,"Good political comedies often touch raw nerves. They often have a left or right wing agenda. Look at Wag the Dog. Or Dr Strangelove. But what surprised me about Charlie Wilson's War (at least the version that reached cinemas) is that it manages to advance the core values of both.As the film was released, political heavyweights McCain, Obama and Clinton square off in the race for the White House. McCain is caught singing, ""Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,"" to the tune of Barbara Ann. Ill-advised humour perhaps. I thought of it in the frequent Charlie Wilson's War refrain, ""Let's kill some Russians."" But where McCain's joke was about invading a sovereign country, Charlie Wilson's War is about defending one. A massive covert operation, described in the film, pushes back the Soviets (not Russians) from their 1980s occupation of Afghanistan. It was one of the major factors that enabled Reagan to end the Cold War. An excellent example of the right wing belief in the supreme importance of military strength.On the other hand, the film points out the failure to re-establish schools and so on after the Soviets left  an aim more traditionally promoted by the left. One cannot help but think that right and left philosophy working effectively together could not only have a) saved the Afghans from the bloody Soviet invasion, b) avoided the power vacuum that was filled by the Taliban and led to Al Qaeda training grounds, c) protected the vital geographical and potential mineral resources and d) even reduced the chance of 9/11.This is rather wishful thinking of course, but not totally impossible. National strength can go hand in hand with humanitarian work.Veteran Director Mike Nichols perhaps had a more left wing approach in mind initially. But it has come out surprisingly balanced, even if it over-simplifies matters (as does this review). Nichols fulfils his stated aim of prompting people to think. And this more effectively than partisan productions such as the right wing ""24"", the left wing ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", or ""conversion"" movies such as ""In the Valley of Elah"".Tom Hanks is Charlie Wilson. A pork-barrelling playboy of a congressman whose greatest achievement is getting repeatedly re-elected. Julia Roberts oozes intelligence and sexy charm. She gets Hanks into bed and into Afghanistan. Between them they rope in such unlikely partners as Egypt, Israel and Pakistan. This alone provides more pointed humour as long-standing religious and political impasses are finessed. Hanks gets the arms to the Afghans.A fantastic story in reality is made even more fantastic in a movie, with equally 'fantastic' performances by Hanks, Roberts and a host of other stars. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a scene stealer as an antagonistic, obnoxious, but highly skilled CIA agent. He gets things done but remains cynical about whether any lasting good is achieved.There have been other thought-provoking political films recently  Lions for Lambs, for instance  but many of them lacked the clout to demand top audience figures. Charlie Wilson's War doesn't fail there. It is witty, held together by a director still at the height of his powers, and is a thoroughly entertaining, sexy, and challenging comedy for intelligent adults.",Charlie Wilson's War
67,MaxBorg89,Entertaining and relevant in equal measure - shame about the rushed conclusion,8,23 February 2008,"The trouble with Mike Nichols is he did his best work in the '60s and '70s (The Graduate, Carnal Knowledge, Catch-22) and has never reached those heights again (though he almost managed to with Closer). Not that he is a bad director - it's just that since the early '90s he has a tendency to excessively emphasize the efforts of his actors, something that can lead to either a good-but-could-have-been-better movie (TV miniseries Angels in America) or an out-front disaster (the Jack Nicholson-starring Wolf). Charlie Wilson's War falls in the first category, but is better than Angels. And frankly, who can blame the director for devoting too much time to the cast when he's got Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the same film?Given Nichols' talent for intelligent comedy, this crazy yet true story provides plenty of juicy material. Set in the '80s, it recounts America's involvement in Afghanistan's war against Russia. Nothing strange, right? Yeah, apart from the fact that it took the stubbornness of a politically incorrect congressman to get things done: Charlie Wilson (Hanks) was no saint, his main interests being cocaine, booze and especially women (all his secretaries were young, good-looking girls, nicknamed ""Charlie's Angels""). In fact, it was thanks to an occasional bedmate, high society member Joanne Herring (Roberts) that he first became aware of the Soviet regime's atrocious deeds in Afghanistan. Throw in an irritable CIA agent (Hoffman) and a larger covert ops budget than anyone could dream of, and there's the beginning of a chain of events that eventually led to the downfall of the USSR.So, politics and colorful characters: who better than Aaron Sorkin to write the screenplay? With his ability to mix tasteful comedy and poignant drama, the A Few Good Men author gives Nichols a script that works perfectly for the film's first 80 minutes: for every scene of despair (the refugee camps) there's a piece of comedy gold (Wilson avoiding the latest scandal), supported by instantly quotable dialogue and marvelous performances: Hanks, cast against type, succeeds in making Charlie likable but not so charismatic that all his sins are automatically forgiven; Roberts is feisty and funny, but the best female work in the movie comes from Amy Adams, simply perfect as Wilson's head assistant; Hoffman, the only cast-member to receive an Oscar nomination, is the best of the lot, his portrayal of Gust Avrakotos (the name is of Greek origin) being filled with primal energy, profanity and excellent comic timing (most obviously in the scene where he is repeatedly asked to leave Wilson's office and then come back). He also gets the best lines: when Charlie inquires about the CIA's strategy in Afghanistan, Gust says: ""We're working on it."" ""Who's ""we""?"" ""Me and three other guys."". Political comedies don't come much sharper than this.However, as I said, the movie is awesome for 80 minutes: the remaining 15, where the whole thing has to be wrapped up, feel rushed and superficial, a fact that lessens the epilogue's ironic point (Charlie inadvertently helped Arabic extremists get weapons). Then again, Sorkin's main characteristic has always been to favor witty dialogue over a dramatically involving plot: it worked on The West Wing, but that was a TV series, and therefore the writer had an entire 22-episode season every year for the story to unfold; here, he has to tell a decade of US politics in 100 minutes - no wonder he runs into problems at the end.Roger Ebert famously said: ""No good film is too long, and no bad film is short enough."". Charlie Wilson's War is a good picture, but could and should have been longer. Perhaps, given Nichols and Sorkin's positive experiences on the small screen, a miniseries wouldn't have been a bad idea.",Charlie Wilson's War

I'm certain there's a lot more to him, both good and bad, than is presented here...But, what is presented here is a very compelling story that years later is, perhaps, even more relevant. Charlie Wilson, a congressman from Texas, almost singlehandedly, steered the U.S. legislature into funding Afganistan's ultimate victory over the Soviet Army. That, in and of itself, is important and should be told. The fact that this has potential for an actual movie versus the usual History Channel treatment is the ""over-the-top"" colorful character who name the title bears. Charlie Wilson was potentially unelectable as his private life was a thinly veiled ""frat party"" with political moments sandwiched in between. In spite of his ""warts and all"" persona his Texas constituents elected him to everything he ran for almost 40 years running. That accomplishment is on par with the larger one depicted in this Mike Nichols film! Speaking of the film...It's entertaining as hell. No small feat considering most of us prefer cleaning aquariums to political biopics. As stated, the name sake is colorful and his accomplishments important enough to have shaped both the Middle Eastern Region and Russian States as they are today. But, the reason this movie works is the deft acting interplay between Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The brilliant yin and yang of their persona's create the perfect comic relief needed in order to tell the story which is actually quite dark and controversial. Fiction should be so entertaining! I amazed at what a few people can do clandestinely while it seems sometimes the world's finest equipped military is held hostage by ""political correctness"" and public opinion which, as we know, changes constantly.

The dialog written by Aaron Sorkin is one of the best I've heard in quite some time especially in the scene when Wilson (Tom Hanks) describes Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman)as no James Bond and Gust refers Wilson as no Thomas Jefferson, ""so they're even"" is one of the best lines in the movies. The exchange in dialog between the character in general is keeps this politically-driven movie alive.During the first hour of this movie, the interactions and the characterizations are the meal tickets to this movie. During the first hour. By the time the second half comes around, the story starts to fade out at times, as facts start taking over, like something you pick up in a college history classroom. Of course as predicted, for a movie like this, it comes to no surprise that a political statement comes into play, which takes a huge chunk from the otherwise entertaining movie, without any regards if it truthful or not.In spite of the minor shortcomings, I still think this movie is highly recommended, though I was hoping it would've been better.

When you see all this play out you wonder if Charlie Wlson could help us in Iraq too. Not sure how, but let's give it a try. Anyone know where the real Charlie Wilson is? Well, what about using Tom Hanks and say he's Charlie again. HmmmmOverall this is very entertaining and the fact that It's based on a real person and story doesn't take anything away. Philip Seymour Hoffman was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and he was very good - didn't get it, but could have. Also, the music while not nominated was, at times, a real toe-tapper.

77,valadas,Idealism and reality,6,17 February 2008,"This is a well made and acted movie whose contents can be summed in a few words: Americans helping the enemies of their enemies to fight against the latter. But since the principle that the enemies of our enemies are always our friends is totally wrong Americans are now fighting those former friends who even use the arms furnished to them by the Americans themselves. But that's quite another story and let's try to leave it aside though it's difficult because all is intertwined. Congressman Charlie Wilson sponsored and incited by an evangelic rich lady whose moral and religious principles don't prevent here of sharing her bed with this or that one (including Wilson himself), enters a crusade against Soviet invasion of Afghanistan maybe for idealism but the reality is quite different: the enemies of our enemies are our friends and we must help them not for idealism but because it helps our own cause. Our cause here is to fight Soviet domination anywhere in the world, mainly in such important areas like the Middle East in order that we be able to dominate it ourselves for our own good. No other interests move us and the proof is there: after the end of the war with the Soviet defeat we leave them to their sad lot and not even a cent for a school we'll give. And the consequences are there in Irak and against in Afghanistan now. Coming back to the movie it's a bit unbelievable that all the actions of Charlie Wilson would be of his exclusive responsibility without the surety bond of the Senate and the President. And that circumstance is not even mentioned in the movie. In conclusion we have here a well made movie but whose contents rouse many doubts.",Charlie Wilson's War
78,intelearts,Great comedic lines and a fair dose of thought,7,9 January 2008,"To describe Charlie Wilson as morally flawed is to describe Mt. Everest as well, fairly big, you know: he does drugs, he does women, he drinks in the morning, and doesn't vote: a frat boy of a congressman.But he does favors, he pushes doors, and, crucially he has heart.What follows is a very funny and very good political comedy about how Charlie Wilson learned about, was moved by, and then moved the political machine to raise funds to support the Afghan people against Soviet genocide.That the film was so funny was a surprise. Even given that this is the director of ""The Graduate"" - it is laugh out loud funny all the way through. Amy Adams, who since Junebug has shown she can mix it up more than just Enchanted did does a great job as Tom Hank's assistant. And Sorkin's script is sharp, and again, funny. All performances are good. Especially Hoffman (Philip Seymour not Dustin) as the cynical hard bitten CIA man - his scenes with Julia Roberts are a lesson in getting the timing right.Though it's unlikely to sweep the board at the awards it is very entertaining - and surprisingly educational - and makes its ""there's a huge lesson to be learned here folk"" with a good heart.Recommended.",Charlie Wilson's War
79,DeeNine-2,How an east Texas congressman made Afghanistan safe for the Taliban,8,1 December 2008,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)BEWARE SPOILERS!! (and pompous displays of semi-relevant erudition)Director Mike Nichols is a past master of women's point of view films that go beyond the narrow confines of the ""chick flick."" Silkwood (1983); Heartburn (1986); Working Girl (1988); and the very fine Postcards from the Edge (1990) come to mind. His first feature was an adaptation of Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor back in 1966. He followed the next year with the generation-defining The Graduate with Dustin Hoffman. His films feature fine satire played along the cutting edge of the popular culture.Here he deviates slightly to celebrate Texas congressman Charlie Wilson who managed to persuade Congress to support the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union in the 1980s. In particular Wilson was able to get American shoulder-launched Stinger missiles for the locals to shoot down Soviet aircraft. In the film we see some nice graphics of just how effective those missiles were. It is no exaggeration to say that Charlie Wilson's intervention turned the tide against the Soviets and eventually persuaded them to withdraw. A few years later, as we all know, the Soviet Union came to its sputtering end.Nichols's ""celebration"" of Congressman Wilson is however mitigated by the revelation that Good Time Charlie was no angel. Tom Hanks plays the alcoholic and cocaine snorting congressman with a genial—almost innocent--duplicity that only hints at the Machiavellian personality required to properly grace the hallowed halls of Congress. Hanks is just too sweet, a nice guy playing at being a practiced power broker. What is missing is the edge of obsession and single-minded egoism. Perhaps we needed John Malkovich with an east Texas twang.Julia Roberts plays Wilson's long-time girlfriend whose interest in defeating the godless communists stems not from any sympathy for the out-gunned Afghans but from religious sensibilities of the sort usually associated with evangelical members of the Daughters of the American Revolution. I found her white wig and high-toned manner a step in the wrong direction for Miss Roberts. I fear that the transition she is making from starlet to star to character actor is an embarrassment that she might want to avoid.The real star of this film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman who plays the international operative and sometime American spy, Gust Avrakotos, a sneaky, blunt and very smart guy who also wants to defeat the Soviets. Hoffman brings to the part the kind of rough edge and frankly Machiavellian intent missing in Tom Hanks' character.The film is marred slightly by a depiction of people in power and their environs that conforms to something like television's mass culture with lots of sleeping around and sharp-edged wise-cracking on the spot, and a somewhat simplistic story line. None of this is to be helped since a living must be made and producers must be assured that the mass audience will attend. Mike Nichols is used to this, and it is remarkable how many fine films he has made that simultaneously seduced not only the money men and the audience, but the critics as well.The message of the film is contained in a Zen master story that goes like this (I am paraphrasing from the quotations page at the Internet Movie Database site): There's a little boy and on his 14th birthday who gets a horse, and everybody in the village says, ""How wonderful. The boy got a horse."" And the Zen master says, ""we'll see."" Two years later the boy falls off the horse, breaks his leg, and everyone in the village says, ""how terrible."" And the Zen master says, ""we'll see."" Then, a war breaks out and all the young men have to go off and fight except the boy who can't because his legs are all messed up. And everybody in the village says, ""How wonderful."" And again the Zen master says, ""we'll see."" This captures the spirit of our continuing military involvement in the Middle East. Today's results may look good or bad but can only be really defined by the unintended consequences to come. We armed the Afghans. Unfortunately their triumph against the Soviet Union led to the rise of the Taliban, and that to their harboring of Al Qaeda which led to 9/11, which led to and so on. How Charlie Wilson's War ultimately ends may not be known for generations.See this for Mike Nichols whose clear direction and sharp eye for satire is undiminished as he approaches his ninth decade of life. (He was 76 when this film came out.)",Charlie Wilson's War
80,sme_no_densetsu,A lively political drama/comedy,7,1 September 2008,"Mike Nichols' film ""Charlie Wilson's War"", set in the 1980's, tells the story of how the title character (played by Tom Hanks) managed to wage a covert war with the Russkies by way of aiding the Afghan forces. Of course, we know how well that turned out in the long run but, thankfully, the film does not gloss over the unpleasant after-effects.The cast is star-studded, with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts being among the most bankable stars in Hollywood. As a bonus, you've got the versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman in a characteristically memorable supporting role, one for which he received a not unwarranted Oscar nomination. I'm not much of a fan of Roberts but Hanks is always dependable. Nevertheless, I can't quite buy into him as a drug-using womanizer, although the real Charlie Wilson seems just as eminently likable as Hanks. Apart from the big three, though, there's not much worth remarking on, even from a recognizable name like Amy Adams.The story is engaging and is bolstered by a fine script from Aaron Sorkin. The verbal interplay between the main characters is excellent and is chock full of memorable lines. The later events set into motion by the war are not ignored though the bookending scenes honoring Wilson seem to me to be too earnest to achieve the bittersweet feel which was likely intended. On the whole, Nichols' direction is workmanlike and follows the action of the script admirably.This is a film that, like Charlie Wilson himself, has flaws but is nevertheless disarmingly likable. Certainly recommended for fans of the three stars and for those looking for an engaging political drama with a light-hearted feel.",Charlie Wilson's War
81,schappe1,It takes all kinds,8,23 December 2007,"Some years ago Indiana Senator Birch Bayh ran for re-election with campaign ads that praised him as ""an experienced politician"". He got beat because the opposition ran against him as a ""politician"", claiming that their man wasn't one. People had the idea that Washington insiders were the cause of all their troubles and wanted to elect nothing but outsiders to government. Ever since then, successful politicians have had to paint themselves as ""outsiders"" and political amateurs to get elected.This is, of course, absurd. You've got to have people how know how things work and how to get things done to accomplish anything. If you send a true outsider to Washington, he's going to be a novice and he's not going to be able to effectuate any change until he becomes exactly what you voted against- an insider, an experienced politician. Of course, in order to accomplish things you have to want to accomplish things. There's always the danger of insiders using their expertise to just increase and maintain their wealth and power. But it's also a danger to fill government with idealists who don't know how to compromise- who don't realize that a good compromise means that I'll help you get what you want if you help me get what I want. If politics becomes a battle of unalterably opposed camps, nothing- nothing good, anyway- can happen. And if one group of fanatics succeeds in expelling another they will run the country in the interests of their own kind at the expense of everyone else.In ""Charley Wilson's War"", we first see Charlie in a very compromised position- in a hot tub with a Playboy Playmate, a Hollywood producer and two strippers. But we immediately see that has interests beyond the hot tub when he starts watching a Dan Rather report from Afghanistan. Then he tells the producer off by asking him to ""not throw my name around any more- I still need it"". When he arrives back in Washington, we see that he isn't a lazy Congressman at all- he knows what's going on, (in Washington, anyway), how the place works and how to accomplish things. Then we meet Joanne Herring, ""the 6th richest woman in Texas"" and a master at bringing the right people together at parties. She knows how to obtain and use influence. She keeps talking about her religious conversion but doesn't let it get in the way of her accumulation of money or power or her sex life. But she's been ambassador to Pakistan and has seen what's going on in the part of the world and is determined that something be done. Finally there is CIA operative Gust Avrakotos, a profane ""bad diplomat"" who has burned his bridges with his Ivy League bosses but who knows what's going on everywhere and what to do about it if anyone will listen. Wilson tells the dumpy-looking Avrakotos ""You're no James Bond"". He replies ""You're no Thomas Jefferson"".But together, they change the course of history. A team of saints might have the highest ideals but they are a lot less likely to accomplish what they want than a team of patriots. (Just ask New Orleans and New England.)",Charlie Wilson's War
82,dunmore_ego,Owned by his Own War,6,25 November 2008,"Before George H.W. Bush sold weapons to Saddam, before Ronald Reagan sold weapons to Iran, before George W. Bush lost 190,000 guns in Iraq - there was Tom Hanks, selling weapons to the Mujahideen.A splinter group of the Mujahideen would later become the Taliban. Thanks again, American Politicians.In the Mike Nichols-directed political intriguer, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, America's golden boy, Hanks, is early-80s Texas Democratic congressman, Charlie Wilson, quite a down-to-earth, uninhibited roarer, rogerer and cad (from this movie's account); not afraid to whore around in public, do drugs at socialite parties and admit to unethical politicians (such as himself). Makes us wonder how such a fun guy was elected in the first place.Charlie Wilson was honored with this movie because he was in a position to help the CIA fund Afghan troops against Soviet invaders, thereby altering a major stream of history. Suffice to say, the movie paints him as noble, basing its stance on one trip he makes to an Afghan refugee camp to visit kids with their limbs blown off, thereby strengthening his resolve to appropriate funds and drive out dem debbil Russkies.Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), an enabled high society harlot who occasionally bumped uglies with Wilson, smarms her way into the history books by being the one who convinced him to visit the camp. She is listed as an influence on Wilson, even though she was just another pretty ass hanging off his cocaine-addled coattails, with a decidedly Marie Antoinette mind set (i.e. out of touch with the common rabble): ""People think it's Joanne the social queen. That's not me at all. I get bored to death when people talk about nothing."" Looked in the mirror lately, honey? Chameleon Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a disheveled, loose-cannon, CIA operative, Gust Avrakotos, whose banter with Wilson is one of the features of this sometimes-tedious exercise.Charlie Wilson's grand non-plan eventually unraveled due to the same political apathy that informs today's inept government machinations - after he supplied the weapons to DESTROY Soviet intrusion, Congress funding disappeared before he could REBUILD; infrastructure, medical supplies, troop necessities were all swept under a Middle Eastern flying carpet.The newsworthy elements were all taken care of (helicopters exploding, commerce continuing, funds disbursed, jubilant crowds in the streets) - who cares what happened next? I'm not gonna bite into the political paradoxes of Wilson's deeds. We are not told WHY anyone would go so far overseas to support a war that isn't theirs. What is the political/financial benefit to America? (It's way too exhausting explaining the misdeeds of amoral politicians to an insensate public. In 2008, Alaskan senator Ted Stevens almost won back his senate seat, even AFTER being convicted of 7 felony counts. How's that for Low Information Voting?) Still, there is no animosity towards the American government in this movie - their neglect to finish the Afghanistan conflict is an unfortunate bureaucratic miscalculation, instead of the endemic problem it has always been. Again, the snide Amurrican gubmint never figured that decades later, their underhanded, unfinished, swinish alliances and misappropriations would be uncovered.From this movie's standpoint, Wilson is the hero, he's Tom Hanks, he's getting an award for being such a rogerer or something, and no one cares what the Mujahideen descendants will do on that far-off date of September 11, 2001.The war and its ramifications continued long after Charlie Wilson stopped finger-poking his two cents' worth. So it only seems to be ""his"" war only during his involvement. He may have felt he ""lost"" his battle with Congress, but considering no one knows his name outside of this favorable movie, I'd say Charlie Wilson came out on top in the end.Whatever will they say about George W. Bush's war?",Charlie Wilson's War
83,KUAlum26,"Dry,wry humor and Real Politique",8,4 January 2008,"Texas 2nd District congressman Charles ""Charlie"" Wilson(Tom Hanks)has gotten where he is because of being a glad-handing,hard-partying and affable sort,full of connections and able to ""never promise what he can't deliver"". So when Houston socialite,local celebrity and raging Conservative Joanne Herring(Julia Roberts)contacts him and sells him on the plight of the Afganistani rebels--the Muhjahadeen(spelling?)in particular--Charlie goes to work to get them what they need to repel the invaders of their land.Of course,it bears noting that the time is circa 1980 and the invaders in question are none other than the mighty Soviet military. At the closing decade of the Cold WAr,tensions were still pretty high between the USSR and USA,so any state attempt to try to combat the Soviets would be tantamount to starting WWIII,so the mission to accomplish for CHarlie becomes covert and nebulous,forming alliances between and among middle eastern nations(of whom famously never liked each other)and a sometimes not-so-subtle funneling project involving congress and the department of state,spear-headed by Gust Avrakatos(Philip SEymour Hoffman),a rumpled but sharp CIA vet who knows his way around any nook and cranny of international relations and its natural breakdown. As with any difficult and unlikely mission,the effort to make this run starts slow and meets resistance but,as soon as it gets going,nets most of the desired results. I'd be inclined to call what I just wrote as spoiler material,but I figure that most(if not all)people who are even somewhat intelligent know the outcome of what happened in the central middle east and,in turn,the Cold War.PLenty of wry humor permeates this film that deals in real events and some very dark,disturbing realities of the world we now know. BAsed on George Crile's best-seller,director Mike Nichols is able to use his usual proclivity to helm funny,pathos-tic qualities to get the desired results out of his cast,while threading sober facts throughout the story. Hanks and Hoffman are very good(though perhaps not exceptional here),and Roberts(for whom I've come to believe has much more charm or charisma going for her than true acting range)is actually exceptional here as a much more ""older"",more vixen-ish,equally tough and seductive. Smaller parts shine through here too:Om Puri as the Afghanistani de facto ruler,NEd Beatty as a self-righteous and bloviating senate sub-committee chair and Amy Adams as Wilson's devoted aide and assistant come immediately to mind. While it's never particularly wise to use movies,particularly studio non-documentary ones,as proxies to actual history studies,this movie would be--besides being just reasonably good entertainment fare--a pretty decent compliment piece to any high school or college class that studies US/Soviet relations and/or Congressional action and deliberation. A little over-simplified in its scope of the world perhaps and,clocking in at just over an hour and forty minutes,may seem somewhat skimpy for the material it attempts to cover,it still works as a document of a rather odd and impressive sub-chapter to contemporary history. Or you can just view it for the pure entertainment value it has.",Charlie Wilson's War

But at some points I had a hard time understanding what was going on. Mike Nichols has been making excellent films since the 60's. I wonder what his directorial debit was. Cause if it was The Graduate, then he is something else.There are lots of good actors in Charlie Wilson's war. Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Ned Beatty. Though I can't say that I loved the film, I can't help but recommend it. Tom Hanks is really what makes this movie what it is. The film is also interesting.Hanks gives a good performance as Charlie Wilson, a playboy Texas congressman who teams up with his crush(played by the always great Julia Roberts) and a C.I.A. agent(played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to stop the terrorism in Afganhistan and stop the Soviet Union.That's all I got out of the plot. Other than that part, I enjoyed the movie. The performances and the laughs are what really makes this movie. This is an interesting picture I must say. Hanks and Hoffman alone made the film work for me. I also loved the movie's soundtrack. Great soundtrack. Though I can't say that this is the best film Mike Nichols has done, I can't help but say see it. I had no idea who Charlie Wilson was. And yes the film's a true story.

Charlie Wilson's war is also a little sentimental but overall a snappy political satire, standing as one of the best, maybe the best by far, among all those socio - political movies of the season, with a brisk pace and a strong rhythm. The look at American geographical areas of interest is quite likable and entertaining, it gives some laughs but also makes understand how bad some decisions made by US Administration were.

86,bobsgrock,Better than expected.,8,27 June 2008,"I didn't quite know if I was really going to enjoy this movie as most films with a political backing to them tend to descend into boring dialogs about things no one cares about. Nevertheless, this one is very much relative to today, considering the US dealings with the Middle East. What is also interesting is that this is the story of a man who did something pretty extraordinary but nearly no one knew who he was. Tom Hanks brings a fine humanity to this character, making him likable despite his rigorous lifestyle. Julia Roberts handles her role well as a rich Houston socialite trying to get the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan. But, Philip Seymour Hoffman steals the show as a CIA agent who assists Charlie into getting the deal done. All the other roles are handled nicely, as is the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin. Full of witty lines and harsh satire, Sorkin brings the whole issue to light in a very entertaining and smooth manner. Overall, this is a movie better than expected and certainly worth taking a closer look at.",Charlie Wilson's War
87,Terrell-4,Amusing...just don't watch a hot dog being made,8,27 January 2008,"To paraphrase Otto von Bismarck, ""Government policies are like sausages; it is better not to see them being made."" I'm of two minds about Charlie Wilson's War, the story of how a charming and mediocre Congressman from East Texas managed to involve the U. S. in the largest covert operation in its history, as the CIA financed a war pitting ferocious religious fanatics, the mujahideen or ""freedom fighters,"" against the Soviet Army in Afghanistan. On the one hand the movie is great fun as we get an inside look at the machinations and maneuvers of our elected and unelected leaders to get what they want, and the bureaucratic response that often smothers many effective initiatives. On the other hand, we're looking at a true story where millions of dollars were spent, hundreds of thousands of lives were lost and bodies maimed, and all because a few people knew how to appeal to the egos, the prejudices and the ""get-on-the-bandwagon"" mentality of our leaders and their minions. Watching the gray paste of meat scraps and beef, pork and chicken by-products being stirred and extruded into hot dogs is more edifying. Basically, this partying Democratic Congressman, Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks), joined by Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), a rich Republican society woman in Houston with high hair and high-handed manners, and Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymore Hoffman), a slovenly, out-of- favor CIA employee, managed to parlay a few million dollars going to Afghanistan guerillas into a real war. The government's initial goal was a quiet, deliberate effort to simply bleed the Red Army. After Charlie Wilson was finished there was a multi-million dollar commitment to arm these guerillas with everything from radar to Stinger missiles. The goal now wasn't to tie the Reds down in an endless war (which was costing the Afghans dearly in blood), but to blow up Soviet tanks, blast their helicopters out of the sky and send them back where they came from. From a deliberate war of attrition, Charlie Wilson managed to make a war of victory, and all clandestinely. It's quite a story...as long as you don't think too hard on how it was accomplished. The director is Mike Nichols and the screenwriter is Aaron Sorkin. Both are glowing examples of America's cultural elite who tend to wear their sympathies on their sleeves. I found a little heavy-handed the hit-on-the-head moral lesson Nichols and Sorkin gives us at the end. The reality is that a great victory was accomplished, but we didn't look too closely at the tribal and almost medieval religious nature of the Afghan guerillas. When the Soviets left Afghanistan, so did our support. We could think of no good reason to help rebuild the nation, provide stability and attempt to develop an ally in that area of the world. The result, of course, is that in a vacuum the most extreme, violent elements among all those fighters we armed became supreme. Anyone among us willing to take credit for the rise of the Taliban? Not on your life. This is a point which could have been made effectively and briefly. Nichols and Sorkin have chosen to make the point with such a heavy hand that it looks suspiciously like political preaching. Charlie Wilson's War most of the time is a well-crafted example of political satire. The story truly is amazing and the three leads all do exceptionally fine work. The movie is based on George Crites book, Charlie Wilson's War. It's amusing, amazing and with minimum preaching.",Charlie Wilson's War
88,Philby-3,Charlie's foreign policy disaster,7,2 March 2008,"As entertainment this film succeeds well. Tom Hanks is always engaging and he does a good job here as a larrikin (Australian for good natured tearaway) congressman from Texas, who in the 1980s managed to cause the US to arm the Mujahadeen, the rebel groups fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan, with some effective weapons. There is a certain satirical bent evident but, inasmuch as it is based on a true story the film provides plenty of ammunition for critics of US foreign policy in the last 20 years. The experts are ignored and weapons deployment is organized by a Texas socialite and a playboy congressman.The results speak for themselves  Charlie Wilson and his friends ended up arming the Taliban and 20 years later Afghanistan is still not at peace, though there are many other reasons for this state of affairs. The movie makers admit this at the end of the movie, but this is after portraying Charlie's part in the story as a merry romp through the spa baths and bedrooms of American high society. If this is the way foreign policy is made in the US we are all in deep trouble.Charlie's dealings with the CIA, who gave him a medal for his work, are, in the film at least, conducted largely through the maverick agent Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman). This is a problem since Gust has little standing in the agency. In fact, Gust is a bit of a spare wheel, despite his droll exchanges with Wilson and others, which is why Hoffman's performance falls somewhat flat. Much of the wheeling and dealing with the Israelis, Pakistanis and others is merely alluded to and at the end of the day you are still left wondering how Charlie did it. The scenes of the relevant congressional committee meetings (Charlie's influence stems from his membership of two important defense committees) are equally frustrating. We see the results of Charlie's efforts but not the process by which they were achieved.Aaron Sorkin wrote the script, so there are plenty of good one-liners. He and director Mike Nichols give the film plenty of sparkle (it's worth the price of admission to see Julia Roberts wearing almost nothing) but this is really the sad and sorry story of a major US foreign policy failure. Well, it could have been worse  Charlie Wilson the Musical anyone?",Charlie Wilson's War
89,blott2319-1,Problematic attempt to tell an only moderately interesting story,6,3 February 2021,"Charlie WIlson's War is a strange story to take on as a film, particularly in 2007. It details a time in the life and career of a Texas congressman as he takes part in financing the distribution of weapons to the Afghani people who were rebelling against the Soviet military. It feels like the film is painting Charlie Wilson as a hero for his warmongering, presumably because it helped to weaken the Soviets during the Cold War. However, that story becomes complicated in light of how time changed things over in Afghanistan, and the fact that those same freedom fighters who were once our allies had begun to rebel against the USA. There's no doubt in my mind that this is intentional, and that the writer and director were both trying to make a point, but I don't know if their purpose in drawing these parallels was clear enough to be effective in any way. I can guess at what their purpose is (considering Aaron Sorkin is far from shy about his political beliefs,) but I wonder if there might be a different story which would suit that cause better than this one.I definitely had some problems with Charlie Wilson's War and the biggest one was Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, he's a good actor that I enjoy, but I struggle to watch him in this role. He never feels right as the womanizing alcoholic jerk that this movie needs. He is too lovable and sweet, so it feels all wrong. It's as if I walked in and found my Dad surrounded by topless women, booze, and cocaine. That's both unsettling and is something I'd find completely out of character for him. The thing is, this was an easy fix. It would have been as simple as swapping the roles of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Tom Hanks, and then the casting would work perfectly for me. The rest of the cast does a fine job, though. They all seem to fit in well, and it's nice to see a number of great actors all in one place. The script seems to be lacking some of that Sorkin magic, and I missed it a lot. Perhaps it was a story he was less enamored with, but there was something that lacked pop and the same kind of driving power to the dialogue that makes his scripts such a treat for me. Charlie Wilson's War was perfectly fine entertainment for a couple hours, but it's not one I'll be returning to watch multiple times in the future.",Charlie Wilson's War
90,hall895,Gust Avrakotos' War?,7,18 January 2008,"This film tells the tale of how obscure congressman Charlie Wilson more or less won the Cold War by funding Afghan freedom fighters in their fight against the mighty Soviet army. The always reliable actor Philip Seymour Hoffman is the best thing the film has to offer. But he's not playing Charlie Wilson. Hoffman plays disgruntled, marginalized and explosive CIA operative Gust Avrakotos and in performing the role so brilliantly Hoffman creates far and away the most compelling, memorable character in the film. He steals every scene he is in and totally upstages the actor playing Charlie Wilson, some nobody named Tom Hanks. Yes, if you can steal a film from Tom Hanks that's saying something, especially considering Charlie Wilson was certainly not short on personality. Hanks is perfectly fine in his role but it seems Hoffman gets all the best lines and moments. The two actors work off one another so well and it is in their interactions that the film works best. It's a film which certainly has its flaws. A bland and boring performance from Julia Roberts doesn't come close to matching the work turned in by Hoffman and Hanks. In fact it is Amy Adams, playing Wilson's assistant, and not Roberts who gives the only female performance of any note here. And the film does struggle to get going, starting off rather slowly. But happily Hoffman comes along to inject some life into the picture and things noticeably pick up once his character is introduced.This is a film, which given the rather serious subject matter, has a lot of humor in it. It's more of a political satire than a straightforward political movie. But it's a movie which can get serious when it has to and it certainly gets its points across, including the point that sometimes even the noblest actions can have unintended consequences. Because once the Soviets were defeated and the Cold War was won the United States lost interest in Afghanistan and all hell was destined to break loose in that country. Everyone knows how that turned out. But enough about the film's lessons, the film itself works. Yes, there are some minor quibbles. Roberts brings very little to the table besides a big name to put on the movie posters. But at least there's the young, enthusiastic Adams to at least partially offset that. And while the film does take a little while to kick into gear it never really drags and the whole thing is wrapped up in a nice, tidy 97 minutes. All in all Charlie Wilson's War is a fine film.

91,Karl Self,Pass me the barf bag,3,14 September 2010,"I'm really struggling not to give that movie the lowest single-point ranking -- I hated it, but granted, it did have Julia Roberts' great performance (as an awful woman), and that of Philip Seymour Hoffman as ""Mr. Laconic"", hard-talking' fast-thinking' CIA-man Gust Avrakotos.Otherwise it's a stunningly myopic, desperately unfunny and implausible tale of the US-American involvement in the Soviet-Afghanistan War.Charlie Wilson is a freewheeling member of the House of Representatives, and at the same time he's a commie-hatin' Republican. One moment he's toking coke in a swingers club (while making sure that everyone around him knows that he's a Republican house member who does drugs and sex -- to garner prospective voters, presumably), the next moment he feels that the US of A isn't doing its darndest to fulfill its god-given mission if putting as many reds as humanly possible six feet under. Actually, before that happens he learns in a Pakistani refugee camp that war is bad for children and other living things, which is why he decides to raise mucho dinero to buy Swiss ack-acks, ""bicycle bombs"" and other cool stuff (the old ""war is murder, so let's kill people""-logic). With the help of a dictator and a bible-bashing Southron slag. And bingo, the war is won.Just so that you don't begin to think that maybe Charlie Wilson isn't a good egg entirely, he's then denied money to build a school in Afghanistan, which is what brought about the Taliban, apparently. Roll credits.Yes, it's really that bad.",Charlie Wilson's War
92,fwomp,"Funny, Sexy, and Downright Interesting...",8,8 May 2008,"When director Mike Nichols is attached to a project, actors and studios listen. From THE GRADUATE to THE BIRDCAGE, Nichols' eye for a specific brand of snappy and broad-ranging comedy is something to be cherished and respected.That CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is based on actual events also makes this story all the more interesting. Taking place in the office of Congressman Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks, THE DA VINCI CODE), we're taken on a wild ride of political manipulation that helps defeat communist Russia during the Cold War. Now one might think that such a fantastic thing as eliminating the communist threat would come from an upstanding and righteous man. Not so. Charlie's a womanizing, drinking, and drug-sniffing man who's responsible for a little known congressional district in Texas. But he's also a damn good looking guy, and he's caught the eye of southern socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts, CHARLOTTE'S WEB), the sixth richest woman in Texas. She implores Charlie to go to Afghanistan and witness the atrocities being committed upon that little-known nation in the name of communism. So Charlie goes and his life is turned around. He comes home and begins pressuring his constituents to place more money and military aid to the freedom fighters in Afghanistan.With Charlie's ideas comes a gruff CIA agent named Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman, CAPOTE) who's abrasive demeanor and beer-gut shape is in direct contrast to Charlie's. But the two learn to cope with one another and bring victory to the Afghan fighters.The most notable performances in the film come not from Hanks, but from Hoffman and Julia Roberts. Philip Hoffman's whip-bang line delivery is astonishing and absolutely hilarious (""What is US strategy?"" ""Most strictly speaking, we don't have one. But we're working on it."" ""Who's we?"" ""Me and three other guys."") And Roberts' performance was quite a surprise. She played the soft but opinionated and strong Ms. Herring exceptionally well, giving one of her finest performances to date. I also enjoyed Amy Adams' (ENCHANTED) role as Charlie's personal secretary. She was always in the background and always right-on target with her beauty and wit. But even she couldn't stand up to the power that is Philip Seymour Hoffman (he definitely deserved the Oscar nod he got this year for his performance here).This is a funny, sexy, and downright interesting story that few people probably know about. One can't help but wonder what new gem Nichols might be working on now and who will be in its cast.",Charlie Wilson's War
93,jon.h.ochiai,We shall see...,10,7 January 2008,"Director Mike Nichols' ""Charlie Wilson's War"" chronicles the exploits of Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson (played by awesome Tom Hanks), who almost single handedly funded and orchestrated the U.S. covert war in Afghanistan against the Russians. However, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" serves as a cautionary tale for the U.S. occupation of Iraq. The line from Charlie Wilson is ""We f---ed up the endgame."" Charlie admits to CIA analyst Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), ""I am not a smart man."" Gust says, ""No, you just work in Congress"" Politics and war are the strangest of bedfellows.Aaron Sorkin (""West Wing"") brilliantly wrote the screenplay based on the book by George Crile. Nichols' ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is biting smart and hysterical, in one of the best movies of the year. Tom Hanks is amazing as Charlie Wilson, the Congressman who acts upon his attack of conscience. This is one of Hanks' most powerful and understated performances. Nichols and Sorkin expertly balance the Russian Army atrocities in the Afghan War and the ironies of Congressional politics with a stinging sense of humor. Based on the true story, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" gets it right for never taking itself seriously. Charlie almost single handedly increased appropriations for Afghanistan from $5 million to $1 billion in a covert operation. The performances by Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman are outstanding and award worthy.While partying with strippers and Playboy cover model in a Jacuzzi in Las Vegas, Charlie Wilson (Hanks), watches a news report by Dan Rather from Afghanistan. On the flight back to D.C. Charlie asks his assistant Bonnie (spunky Amy Adams) to make appropriate inquiries on the Hill. Charlie is both on the Armed Services Committee as well as a Covert Operations chair. The divorced Charlie also calls upon Texan power broker and occasional lover Joanne Herring (tough and smart Julia Roberts). Joanne sees Afghan War as a Christian War, even though Afghanistan is a Muslim country. At the same time Charlie is investigated for illicit cocaine use which could terminate his position.First order of business is flying to Pakistan to meet with the Pakistan President. Pakistan harbors the Afghan refugee camps. Charlie witnesses first hand the atrocities upon the Afghan people, particularly the children-- victims of rape and ""toy bombs"". Charlie's imperative becomes providing state-of-the-art hi-tech weaponry and training for the Afghans to shoot down the Russian helicopters of mass destruction. The catch is that the arms must be brokered, and can not be directly linked back to the U.S. This forms an alliance between Israel, Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, who have access to this weaponry—an unheard of feat. Charlie's guy to make this happen is CIA analyst Gust Avrakotos (brilliantly cynical Hoffman). Together they take on the Russian Army in Afghanistan.Near the end Gust tells Charlie the story of the Zen Master and the boy. The message of the allegory is: ""We shall see."" ""Charlie Wilson's War"" eloquently illustrates that by nature, destruction may be easier than creation. We have seen this time and again throughout history, and seem slow in learning this lesson. Mike Nichols' direction is sharp, funny, and ultimately poignant. And his performances are amazing. Julia Roberts is a surprise in really a character role. As Joanne her Southern belle charm and frankness masks a brilliant strategist who takes no prisoners. Roberts kills in this role. Philip Seymour Hoffman is perfection as Gust. Hoffman gives Gust deceptive smarts, and a war weary sense of the absurd. We get that despite himself Gust is a good guy. Amy Adams (""Enchanted"") as Bonnie is a refreshing foil to Charlie—she is a great spirit. The ubiquitous Emily Brunt (""The Devil Wears Prada"", ""Dan in Real Life"") is very sultry and sexy as Jane. Tom Hanks is awesome. There is the great moment when his Charlie tells Bonnie, ""You know you've reached rock bottom when you're told you have character flaws by a man who hanged his predecessor in a military coup."" Hanks is powerful as the flawed man, who takes upon greatness, when his line in the sand is crossed. Hanks amazingly embodies humanity and humor in the often time absurd and cruel world of affairs. He is the soul of ""Charlie Wilson's War"". ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is one of the best movies of the year, well worth seeing.",Charlie Wilson's War

If only the film had the same air of insouciance; but apart from Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as a cynical CIA agent, it tries to be perceived as patriotic too. Aaron Sorkin's trademark staccato dialogue serves its purpose, but the story is no more plausible than one of Wilson's tall tales.

It turns out he was a congressman who was largely responsible for funding the US covert operation in Afghanistan during the 80's against the Soviet Union. Charlie was a larger than life character who was more likely to make the headlines for the wrong reasons than anything he did in politics.Tom Hanks plays Charlie and does a fine job backed up by Julia Roberts who plays a socialite who supports the cause. The standout performance though is from Philip Seymour Hoffman who plays a CIA operative. We're obviously in the Oscar season and I would be very surprised if Hoffman doesn't bag a supporting actor nomination. The fact he won a gong for Capote will probably go against him for the overall award, but it's well worth seeing the film for his performance alone.",Charlie Wilson's War
97,Danusha_Goska,"Smart, Funny, Slick and Sophisticated Take on Recent American History",8,22 December 2007,"""Charlie Wilson's War"" is a funny, slick limousine ride. I haven't heard a script this smart since re-watching an old Joe Mankiewicz movie. No surprise -- the script is the work of Aaron Sorkin, who wrote ""The West Wing."" Though the film depicts the real story of the US's disastrous funding of the very people who would attack her on 9-11, the script is, in many places, laugh-out-loud funny.The leads are superb; Philip Seymour Hoffman, whom I usually can't stand, is especially good here as Gust Avrakotos, a charm-impaired Greek-American CIA agent. Julia Roberts is very believable as a hard-driving millionaire who whips government agencies around to her whim. The thrilling new star, Amy Adams, is wasted in a role that requires her to do nothing but gaze at Tom Hanks worshipfully.I can't give the film ten stars because while it tells one truth -- that of Charlie Wilson, who has no regrets for funding America's enemies  it doesn't tell the whole truth. The Soviets' reasons for involvement in Afghanistan should have been discussed. The Soviets had a lengthy history of mutual relations with relatively progressive forces in Afghanistan, forces that were fighting men who stood for enforced illiteracy and the virtual enslavement of women.The nature of the ideology the Soviets were fighting should have been made more clear. In one scene, Doc Long (Ned Beatty) protests giving money to the kind of people who would imprison a blind rape victim because her being raped meant that she was guilty of sex outside of marriage. But that throwaway line doesn't begin to address the disaster that awaited the US.An opening sequence hints at the blowback the US suffered from Charlie Wilson's war. A mujahedin prays under a crescent moon. He rises, and shoots a missile at the audience.Hanks as Wilson insists that the US suffered this blowback because the US failed to fund Afghan schools. This is nonsense. As UN statistics show, poor education, and, in many places, the denial of education to females, is epidemic throughout the Muslim world. The US can't be blamed for this.Back to the movie. It's slick, sophisticated, funny, and fun. Give it a ride.",Charlie Wilson's War
98,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Light comedy on the surface, biting satire beneath.",9,21 August 2009,"""Charlie Wilson's War"" is a film that has different layers. A viewer with a keen sense for satire will see this instantly in some of the scenes that have caused slight and not so slight outrage. The main of these scenes that I refer to begins with Soviet troops parading through Moscow as a lively anthem plays, it is proud display of Soviet military might that soon cuts to helicopter gunships raking Afghan towns with merciless firepower. The superficial message here is that the Soviet Army is evil. Seeing that this is an American produced film, that explanation seems to fit for many viewers. In fact, the YouTube clips containing this scene contain many comments about this being US propaganda. Is it?The film is written by Aaron Sorkin who has made a career out of acclaimed politically themed writing and is directed by Mike Nichols who makes few but always thought out movies, this explanation feels too lazy. Sorkin and Nichols don't seem to be people who would just show senseless killing for purposes of vilification. In taking look at the way this sequence is put together, we can reveal another layer to the film: the satire. The scene is inter-cut with what looks like stock and archive footage of the helicopters and some obviously computer generated helicopters... it seems rather sloppy for such a high budget film with many A-List actors. The first time the Soviet chopper appears firing, its gun looks like a laser blaster from a video game... the missile effects are inconsistent with the stock footage. One quick shot of archive footage shows a chopper firing to the right, then cuts to a a CGI missile coming in from the right as well as a CGI chopper. Another quick shot of documentary footage shows a volley of missiles being fired from a wing pylon, then, in a perspective shot of the movie's footage ONE missile impacts the top of a wall and engulfs the screen in flame... did the pilot just fly into his own missile's fireball? And why was this one so much bigger than the previous or ensuing ones?The reason being is: the jokes is on us, we the audience. It is all intentionally, and somewhat subtly, ridiculous. There is no doubt that the Red Army committed its share of war-time atrocities in Afghanistan, like any army does in almost an war, but the point is that vilification is senseless. There is more to every story behind every war. The film shows that the typical (and propagandistic in this case) movie archetype of the evil army is shown to be fully ridiculous. In escapist movies it is fine, but in historical films, it is far from it.The rest of the film is much in the same vein. It gets behind what we are normally shown; a different, but key, layer of war: the funding of it. Strings are pulled and words are carefully chosen behind the curtain, but in front of it a full blown war is waged that today had led to disastrous consequences is waged. This is far from typical for a big-budget film and it was probably why the story structure had the main message and satire hidden behind an easily pleasing layer of light comedy. --- 9/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- profanity, drug use",Charlie Wilson's War
99,jpschapira,Nichols and difficulty,7,2 February 2008,"Again, Mike Nichols brings to the theaters a movie that, like ""Closer"", is not for everyone. The mentioned film is a very powerful and painfully honest tale of two couples and their problems; ""Charlie Wilson's War"", Nichol's new film is a political comedy as hard to follow as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". Once it begins, it doesn't stop; for very old people it has too much dialogue and for 14-year-olds it contains too much politics...My brother had it rough.""Charlie Wilson's War"" tells the story of congressman Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) and the things he did to help Afghanistan destroy the Russians during the Cold War; and that's summarized. The first forty minutes the politics are serious and intelligent, even when the first scene shows Wilson in a room with strippers doing cocaine and when his office is filled with beautiful women occupying important positions with a lot of responsibilities.Passed those forty minutes, the intelligence continues but the seriousness goes away and it's replaced by pure satirical comedy. You can argue all you want, but the only serious thing in the movie from that moment on is its historical context, because the rest is Aaron Sorkin's gift for making people laugh and a hell of a cast.It's nice to watch a film where everyone is playing the same game; where they are inside the game and they know how to play it. Mike Nichols achieves this when he directs; in ""Closer"" it resulted in drama, but his four actors where totally connected and shared long scenes together. Here he orchestrates the opposite, putting three great actors on screen but making them share few confrontations; yet the result is the same, except that we laugh and not cry.How can you reject a laugh when the great Philip Seymour Hoffman is back in comedy and in great shape with 'the hand' in place? I don't know if you've noticed, but in each of his roles he manages to find a moment where he puts one of his hands in a determined position; it's always the same position and it's a brand of the actor. Anyway, he's a monster and giving details of his work here is in vain. However, it maybe the only reason to really watch the film.Tom Hanks does a fine job, mostly in the parts where he looks like an ordinary man and drives away from the characters with huge life experiences he's used to play. His Charlie Wilson has no suffering; he knows of his ignorance and he's sure there are millions who can do his job better than him, but he does it and he has fun.Julia Roberts' return to the big screen? It's honestly no big deal. She looks gorgeous and she plays the game I talked about, but if you've seen ""Closer"" you know that Mike Nichols can get a lot more out of her. Now, if Nichols succeeds with a comic script and does the same with a dramatic one, imagine what he could do if he gets something really good that combines both things. He's done in the past. Oh, Sorkin can make people cry too (""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"", ""The West Wing"")",Charlie Wilson's War

Misperceived as a ""comedy"" -- though it is hugely and frequently funny -- the film is fact-based. Charlie Wilson was a member of Congress who did do what the movie says he did: single-handedly engineer funding for the transfer of sophisticated arms to the fighters who ultimately drove the Soviet army out of Afghanistan. And, as the film hints at the very end, the ironic result is that the war ushered in the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan and trained Islamic recruits, including Osama bin Laden, for the terrorist war against the West and, in particular, the U.S. and Israel, who together made the Soviet defeat possible.Charlie Wilson is correctly depicted by Tom Hanks as a hard-drinking womanizer with extraordinary behind-the-scenes influence. I'm not one of Tom Hanks' biggest fans but he is letter perfect in this role. I have no idea whether the rogue CIA agent played by Philip Seymour Hoffman is based on an actual person but if he did not exist he should have, and Hoffman is as good in this part as he has ever been (which is saying quite a bit). Julia Roberts steps completely out of character to play a wealthy Houston woman who passionately embraces the Afghan cause and pushes Wilson to take it on as his own crusade. Roberts is a better actress than she is usually credited with being, and she is utterly believable in this role. Amy Adams, as Charlie Wilson's chief aide, also does well.Much of the credit for the sharpness of the satire must go to Adam Sarokin who wrote the script and to the great Mike Nichols who directed.""Charlie Wilson's War"" is a satire, not a comedy, and it catches a moment and an event that shattered the myth of Soviet invulnerability, helping to end the Cold War -- and at the same time took the United States on the road to its present conflict with Islamic extremism.

Oscar winners Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman dazzle the screen. Of the three thespians, I liked Hoffman the most. His role as CIA agent Gus Avrakotos was not only comical with his one-liner deliverers and cynicism, but he also puts a little bit of a satire as not being the Agent 007 type as most people would anticipate of the agents in the government.Tom still has his charm as being a likable guy. He fits the role well as the womanizing, alcoholic, and persuasive Charlie Wilson. Julia Roberts has good looks and plays a determined character that would do anything to get involved in helping the Afghans for a ""religious cause."" However, I felt her character to be a naïve beauty that likes partying, has a non-subtle accent, and a snobbish attitude.She may have been a little bit weak, but was still a good pick for the role as Joanne Herring. I also liked Amy Adams as Wilson's closest secretary. The story was rock solid. It really got in-depth as how Charlie Wilson aided Afghanistan with weapons with all the men he persuaded and he used to get the job done. It was enjoyable and interesting, not to mention the wonderful script done by Aaron Sorkin. But I have to say I'm surprised that this movie was considered a comedy under the Golden Globes for Best Picture. Yeah, this movie had quite a bit of humor in it, but it's depiction of what happened in Afghanistan in the 1980s was far from being humorous. There was some war violence in it, but that's not what makes it a serious story.The film closes with the quote by Charlie Wilson, ""All these things have happened, and they were gloriousand then we f----- up the end game"". It is a bit funny, but it states that the U.S. may have given Afghanistan weapons and aid during the war in the 1980s, but they packed up and left them behind to rebuild the country for themselves. From this, it has led to some of the trouble in the Middle East.

104,virek213,"Cynical, Profane, Timely, And Hilarious",9,25 December 2007,"There is something to be said for political movies being made in Hollywood at any time in history, but particularly now while we are bombarded with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have lost all meaning. Politics is a pretty gutsy thing to use as the basis of a film. Case in point is CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR.Scripted by Aaron Sorkin (of TV's ""The West Wing"" and the 1992 classic A FEW GOOD MEN), and directed by Mike Nichols (whose 1967 film THE GRADUATE is a touchstone American film), CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is based on the true exploits of Texas congressman Charlie Wilson (here played superbly, as always, by Tom Hanks), who, during the 1980s, with the help of an avuncular CIA man (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and the goading of a right-wing socialite (Julia Roberts), initiated a seven year-long covert operation to help the Mujahadden fighters defeat the Soviet Union after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in late 1979. The film, in its own cynical and profane fashion, shows how this congressman, who despite his liberal credentials somehow represents a fairly right-wing district in east Texas, could make contacts with sworn enemies like Pakistan, Israel, and Egypt, and get each side to fund the Mujahadeen without any evidence of that funding being traced back to the Beltway. The banter between Hanks, Hoffman, and Roberts is wildly amusing and with more than a little sarcasm on the side as well. Indeed, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR seems to be as much a political black comedy as anything else, what with Hanks' womanizing aspects, and Roberts' underhanded put-on of east Texas airs. And although Hanks is made out to be the hero, at the end he is also frustrated that his colleagues on the Hill won't take up the task of rebuilding Afghanistan--a mistake by them that, in the end, will prove to have severe consequences in the not-too-distant future.Decades removed from THE GRADUATE, Nichols, however, hasn't lost any of his directorial instincts, as he shows in handling this dicey material that has considerable relevance to today. Sorkin's wildly inventive dialogue propels the film to even greater heights, and helps straighten out the misconceptions about the end of the Cold War--that it wasn't just America's triumph over the broken Communist system, but the world's as well.

""Technically I did cocaine in the Cayman Islands but that's out of American jurisdiction."" Yes, it's the slimy lecherous alcoholic politician who just saved his hide on a loophole. Our hero, ladies & gentleman... And what's worse is how director Mike Nichols hid Charlie's crime from the audience in much the same way real politicians hide their crimes from their constituents: delicately-worded dialogue and deceptive maneuvering. It's similar to the way we're asked to find Charlie's whoring adorable because we never see his wife. Out of sight, out of mind... right?Sorry. I find the character loathsome, mainly because we're asked to consider him a hero. We've come a long way from Mr. Smith's trip to Washington if an adulterous coke-snorting lush is the new Lincoln.What's even worse about this movie is its political naiveté: There are no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" in war... it's all a matter of where you're standing. And what's worse, this ""war"" is nothing more than a product of the United States' profitable wargames pastime: arming and funding a country or cause to fight our wars for us only to turn around and consider said country or cause a threat, at which we point we bomb them to oblivion and rebuild their country using our contractors. Sound familiar? It's just the life-cycle of the military/industrial complex.

It was shallow, the story was shallow, the character is predictable and the whole thing felt like a work of an amateur.I really tried to like the movie but it really it wasn’t working. The story, it is as if they did only one week of research and writes it in three days, it was misplace, shallow, predictable and unpolished. I’m not a script expert but it was raw enough for anyone to notice that. Also it was boring, and all the jargon making it hard to understand. All the character have one personality of its own, there are no dimension in this movie.Well I guess it was the actors in it that attract me to watch the movie and all of them are Oscar Winners, and here I thought with them on board it was more or less guarantee how good the movie going to be. But I was wrong, it was like a favor to someone that why they are in this movie. I was pretty disappointed with Tom and Julia performance.The direction is pretty weird and what weirder is the editing, I thought it suck big time, and nothing seem quite to be working at all. The montages add more realism to the movie but don’t go well with the tone of the movie. What I didn’t like about this movie was the detail wasn’t there; it was all in the surface.Overall it was a huge disappointment for me, the only thing that might make me come back to watch it was two minutes of sexy body of Emily Blunt and all those hot secretary of Charlie Wilson. Otherwise this movie was flat, and all the funny scenes is no longer funny cause you already seen it on trailer.Recommendation: There No Way I’m going to See This Again.Reason to Watch: Emily Blunt in lingerie’s.Reason Not To: Seem like a Very Lazy Work to Me.Rating: 5/10 (Grade: D).Please Rate Y/N Only After Read",Charlie Wilson's War
107,MichaelMargetis,Refreshing Political Satire,8,29 December 2007,"In one of the better movies of the year, Tom Hanks stars as Congressman Charlie Wilson in this sardonically funny and extremely relevant (given reasonably current events) historical comedy-drama surrounding the 1980s Afghan/Soviet fiasco. The Soviets were attacking Afghanistan killing hundreds of people. Why should anyone care? People are dying, right? No, the reason the United States got involved through Charlie Wilson was because the Afghans, in fear they would get blown to sh_t, started illegally coming into Pakistan which in turn p_ssed Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq off. Charlie Wilson in an effort to fix this situation teamed up with the sixth richest woman and religious fanatic in Texas, Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and a amusing and robust American spy for the CIA, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to help supply Afghans with high-tech weapons to destroy Soviet fight air-craft that would try and attack their land.Although certainly not a serious Oscar contender for Best Picture, 'Charlie Wilson's War' is probably one of the best of the many political films of the year. Academy Award Winner Mike Nichols provides solid directing as to be expected while Emmy Award Winner Aaron Sorkin (Sport's Night, The West Wing) provides a remarkable screenplay that near-flawlessly balances comedy and drama. The acting is great for the most part as well. Tom Hanks delivers his best and most enjoyable performance since his 2000 Oscar-nominated turn as a FedEx worker stranded on a tropical island in 'Cast Away'. Hanks takes a slimy character like Wilson and with his trademark charm turns him into a likable guy. Amy Adams and Ned Beatty are reliable as always, but the real stand-out performance of the film is from Philip Seymour Hoffman. Arguably the finest actor working in the film industry today, Hoffman takes a small supporting role and upstages everyone around him. From his first scene where he's screaming at his boss before violently breaking his window, Hoffman sucks you in. The only disappointing cast member is unsurprisingly overrated Hollywood starlet Julia Roberts. Hamming her way through yet another movie, Roberts' overbearing and over-the-top portrayal of a rich Texas oil woman hits all the wrong notes and is at most times flat-out annoying. At 97 minutes, the movie is short and sweet, and that isn't to say it doesn't drag at some points but when it does drag it's for a very brief amount of time.In conclusion, 'Charlie Wilson's War' is not a perfect film by any means, but it's certainly worth a look.

Aaron Sorkin's writing is perfect for this kind of movie: great dialogue between the characters and good lines throughout the film. But for a movie like this I expect more drama to happen for example: when Charlie was accused of substance of drugs, this kind of mid - plot could have give more details on Charlie's character and deliver more drama if they had focused on it. But at the end this kind of mid - plot was left aside. The characters on the other hand were good. The cinematography was nicely made, I even noticed a few good long shots during the movie that fitted well in the movie's tone of long conversations. All in all I don't recommend if you're interested but the movie overall can be seen as a history lesson.",Charlie Wilson's War
109,andrewroy-04316,"A well-written and acted political drama, but only scratches the surface of its ideas",5,12 October 2020,"Charlie Wilson's war is a fine political movie that has its pleasures, but also has its flaws (like its protagonist). Sorkin writes a solid script as always, with witty and politically plausible dialogue. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is an absolute scene stealer here and elevated the movie to be enjoyable for me. I also liked Amy Adams as always, and Hanks is great in the third act but forgettable otherwise, and Julia Roberts was unimpressive. The film is focused on US involvement in Pakistan during the Cold War, but neither shows much of the political resistance to investment in the region nor adds much thematic depth. It's clear that the narrative is intended to be Charlie Wilson as this unexpected champion for helping Pakistan, but we never actually see the challenges he has to face in getting people on board (we see this a bit in one of the final scenes of the movie with respect to school funding, but by then it's too little too late). Partially because of this, we also get far more exposition about what's going on and convincing different people to get on board than seeing the nuances of the political situation. The situation in Pakistan was given so much exposition that you'd think it was complex, and then the movie presents it as a completely black and white issue of helping helpless people deserving of US aid. The direction and editing were both weak and served to highlight the contrast between the depth of the story being told with the amount of exposition and jumping around between players we do. Scenes with Julia Roberts' character in them were the most egregious, as her interest in the region was poorly explained and she seemed like a character emphasized so that Charlie had a friend to lean on and be pushed into action than to be a genuinely compelling character. The cocaine scandal also felt superfluous, and while the writing of the scene with Gust coming in and out of the room was hilarious, I don't think any of those scenes added anything to the film. Despite these considerable flaws, it still does have the charms I mentioned earlier, PSH chief among them, and even at its worst, it's a superficial, easy to run with political drama. I would've liked to see more nuance to the story and would be really interested to see how the style and themes would have been explored with a better director working with Sorkin.",Charlie Wilson's War
110,ClaytonDavis,Good War Fought,7,2 January 2008,"Aaron Sorkin's quit witted script is the best part of Mike Nichols' newest film Charlie Wilson's War. Starring Academy Award winner Tom Hanks in the title role as the bachelor who takes on the daunting task of helping the rebels in Afghanistan during the 80's and its effects on the future.As light as the film is at times bringing resemblance to 1998's Primary Colors, Nichols' film hits some heavy tones and speaks very effectively to what's going on right now during our time of war. Hanks who has in the past years hasn't even resembled the thespian of his former self that made America fall in love with him, shows the viewer glimpses to his former self. Philadelphia, Big, Forrest Gump, iconic roles like this, that made Hanks the top actor of the 90's has struggled in his past few roles. This is finally something for the actor to be proud of.Julia Roberts who starts off extremely strong and loses steam quickly, plays wealthy Texan Joanne Herring who brought the war to Congressman Charlie's attention. Her cattiness is fun and evident but the role may be too underdeveloped for the audience to engage themselves in her. Philip Seymour Hoffman suffers the same fate as Roberts in a strong supporting turn for the actor but holding no measure to his other 2007 work, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. As the intelligent Gust, he embodies all qualities that we wish we had in our everyday professions.Amy Adams as the Congressman's secretary is equally as effective and underrated in performance. Adams is going to be one of our best working actress' in the coming years. Emily Blunt in her sexy, and that's an understatement, extremely sexy, brief performance is quite memorable It's Sorkin's great script that is awards worthy.Not bad for a good day's work.

I liked Hanks and I thought the acting, particularly by Roberts and Hoffman, turned a patriotic American backslapping exercise into a film that pawed its way out of that sludge.It was embarrassing sitting through all that patriotic nonsense sprinkled throughout the film. Anybody with the slightest knowledge of what America did to the former Soviet Union must watch this movie with a bag of salt on their lap to mollify the Cold War propaganda that kept the folks in Kansas glued to their screens. It is common knowledge that bin Laden was a product of this little Cold War charade in Afghanistan. It is also common knowledge that the opium poppy cultivation during the Taliban years, the group that America put into power, was virtually zero and now after America's invasion and occupation of Afghanistan, the level of poppy production is higher than before the Taliban but then America needs opium production to earn black money so capitalism can continue to expand.

A lot of fun but there was a bit too much propaganda and those clips of actual war footage felt immensely out of place. But Philip Seymour Hoffman was phenomenal. I didn't stop laughing whenever he was on screen. Honestly, his first scene with the breaking of the glass and the scene where he first meets Charlie are two of my favorites of the year. And Emily Blunt was so hot for the two minutes she was on screen. The dialogue was also pretty fantastic. I loved the dry humor, but I really just can't get over how much I adored Hoffman.

It only occasionally achieves the perfect synthesis of performance and screenplay that works so well in Sorkin's other projects, and it's pretty much only Philip Seymour Hoffman who is responsible for it. Hanks is solid but pretty low-key, and Julia Roberts is fairly terrible in her attempt to both speak in a Southern drawl and sound intelligent. That said, the film actually works pretty well until the absolutely dreadful montage of war scenes, which is interrupted by a fairly uncomfortable and disturbing bit of black comedy that feels completely at odds with everything else the film has going for it. And it just leads into a really awkward finish. In general, the film is using a light tone to tackle some pretty heavy subject matter, and the abrupt shift to a 'message' of sorts at the film's finale just doesn't work. It's a decent film, but it's also a pretty big disappointment.",Charlie Wilson's War

Should we castigate the Ruskies for (at the time of the events) being equally obnoxious? Should we feel sorry for the put upon Afghanis who are now considered an axis of evil (by the axis of evil)?

115,MCMAYNERBERRY,Playful Polictians=Witty Film,8,23 April 2008,"The true story of how a playboy congressman, a renegade CIA agent and a beautiful Houston socialite joined forces to lead the largest and most successful covert operation in history. Their efforts contributed to the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, with consequences that reverberate throughout the world today.Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) was a bachelor congressman from Texas who had a habit of showing up in hot tubs with strippers and cocaine. His ""Good Time Charlie"" exterior, however, masked an extraordinary mind, a deep sense of patriotism and a passion for the underdog, and in the early 1980s the underdog was Afghanistan--which had just been brutally invaded by the Russians.Charlie's longtime friend and patron and sometime lover was Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), one of the wealthiest women in Texas and a virulent anti-communist. Believing the American response to the Russian invasion was anemic at best, she prods Charlie into doing more for the Mujahideen (Afghan freedom fighters).Charlie's partner in this uphill endeavor is CIA Agent Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a blue-collar operative in a company of Ivy League blue bloods. Together, the three of them--Charlie, Joanne and Gust--travel the world to form unlikely alliances among the Pakistanis, Israelis, Egyptians, arms dealers, law makers and a belly dancer.Their success was remarkable. Funding for covert operations against the Soviets went from $5 million to $1 billion annually. The Red Army retreated out of Afghanistan. When asked how a group of peasants was able to deliver such a decisive blow to the army of a superpower, Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq responded simply, ""Charlie did it.""

117,bobbobwhite,The most important thing in this film,8,24 December 2007,"was the meaning and implications of the joke told by Phillip Seymour Hoffman's scruffy CIA character to Congressman Charlie Wilson(Tom Hanks)about a good thing following a bad thing following a good thing and on and on....... the joke told that each time one of these things happened one person would ask another, ""what do you think about it"" and he answered, ""we'll see"". That sums up the entire meaning of the film.....what ever one may think is the greatest or worst solution for something at the present time may not turn out to be such a great or wrong answer in the future. Thus, the constant response of ""we'll see"".Proof of that in real life?......sophisticated weapons given to Afgans to shoot Russian choppers and tanks during that '80's invasion were used later by the Taliban to kill US troops after 9/11, but the Taliban part happened after this film's time line so at the end of this film we could have said, ""we'll see"" (if it's so great)and it would have been true until 9/11... something that was a great solution at one time turned terrible at a later time.This film story was very entertaining and included three of the most effective actors working today...Hanks, Hoffman and Julia Roberts. The Hollywood-ized machinations of inner dealworking of a national congressman were interesting and funny, along with the slick and sleazy side action that is always a part of these questionable deals. Hanks was perfect for the role, as he became Charlie Wilson and positively oozed good old boy Texas charm in all his deal making, and his womanizing. Hoffman was also perfect as the no-bullshit, street wise CIA operative who was initially leary and cynical of of the good of it all but who soon turned very supportive as he helped Charlie make the moves that resulted in a billion dollar deal for arms that allowed the Afgans to defeat the Russian invasion. Roberts was also great as a rich Houston socialite who had a long running affair with Charlie, even during marriages, and used his political clout to achieve her grand humanitarian goals that, this time, included saving Afganistan from Russian rule.A very entertaining film, and one of the best of this holiday season.",Charlie Wilson's War

He regularly gets the upper hands and uses it to great effect. Roberts uses her attractiveness to get her way, even in a hot tub and bikini. And Hanks, despite the early scene with his butt, but on a great act as the former congressman.There are some historical flaws, of course. Reagan was said to have been President in 1980. Nacogdoches was called a 'township', though in Texas every incorporation is a ""city"" by default. And the CIA is displayed at to giving weapons in Northern Afghanistan, but yet Pakistan really gave most of our weapons to a man who turned out to be anti-American.Overall, I thought the movie was very well done.

119,luke-a-mcgowan,Surprisingly entertaining romp with a serious storyline.,8,24 May 2015,"Charlie Wilson's War walks a bizarre and uncommon line between political drama and playboy comedy. You won't find many films out there like it. Therefore, what Mike Nichols and co create on screen is a novel, entertaining film with a serious story to tell. It tells the story of Charlie Wilson, a playboy Texas Congressman who finds himself in an easy but very powerful position. His district doesn't want much, so he gets to vote yes a lot. And when a powerful woman in his district becomes passionate about the cause, Charlie finds himself in Afghan refugee camps and his view of the world changes.Aaron Sorkin is a master of words, but I won't pretend that Charlie Wilson's War is a Social Network or a West Wing. The script of Charlie Wilson's War is a lot weaker than those are. But its still classic Sorkin - politically savvy, full of razor sharp dialogue and has some incredibly memorable moments. Case in point, the scene where Gust Avrakatos screams at Henry Craverly about not giving him a promotion, or the scene in which Wilson meets Avrakatos for the first time. There's a lot of banter going on in this film, even in scenes where you wouldn't expect, and its utterly delightful.Mike Nichols does some great work behind the scenes. The aforementioned scene where Avrakatos meets Wilson unfolds like a play, its really quite special. Avrakatos goes out on door, Wilson's staff come in the other. Wilson picks up his dialogue between both with aplomb. The contrast between two scenes, one in which Wilson is on fire making billion dollar deals and the other he's trying to rebuild, is very powerful and very effective.But there are times where I questioned the choices Nichols and Sorkin made. There are lines of dialogue that really don't fit (""I have no ***** idea who this guy is!"" breaks up what is otherwise a master scene between Slattery and Hoffman) and scenes that make even less sense (apparently Joanne gets married during the film, to Wilson's loneliness, but one scene later they openly kiss). Some scenes are funny that shouldn't be, and there isn't as much emotional devastation to the camp scenes as there should be. The film's climactic scene, ostensibly put in because producer Tom Hanks didn't want a sad ending, really screws up the message its trying to make.But the film's strongest asset, and the one that makes up for all of the flaws, is the masterful acting. Tom Hanks is startlingly well cast as Charlie Wilson. At times, he could be an older version of Forrest Gump, he's so jovial and loud. He carries the film's funniest moments and also its more tender ones (even those that don't fit are good because of Hanks). Amy Adams is sweetly adorable as Hanks' executive assistant, with her big eyes and trustworthy nervous smile, she wins the audience over with ease, especially during some of the refugee camp scenes. Julia Roberts is serviceable, showing a bit of talent but mostly just hiding under that huge wig. But it is in this moment where I must dedicate space to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. This is one of my favourite performances of his, and likely his most memorable after Boogie Nights. He's the perfect balance of calm and furious. He nails Sorkin's beautiful words with style, and he creates cinematic gold. What a well-earned Oscar nod, and were it not for Javier Bardem, I think Hoffman might have taken home a second Oscar. Charlie Wilson's War walks an untread path, and comes out unscathed. Its not perfect, but it handles the weird balance very well. Its well-acted, well-scripted and very entertaining, and ultimately, you can't ask for much more.",Charlie Wilson's War

122,the_wolf_imdb,Who did 9/11? Charlie did it!,5,17 January 2012,"The movie is pretty much okay on technical level and the acting is good. It shows, however, the real nature of American stupidity when it comes to politics. The proverb that the ""Enemy of my enemy is my friend"" is basically wrong. You may help your enemy to fight his enemy, but you will never become his friend when it comes to Islamic countries. At the best you will become ""the useful idiot"".You can see it in documentaries: The Americans are proud to help ""freedom"" in the Afghanistan, but the Afghan leaders actually had no idea who was helping them. It was irrelevant to them who would supply them the weapons and explicitly told they gave no damn about Americans, because ""it was their own (Afghan) blood that will be spilled"" and ""they gave us just some money"". Absolutely no respect, absolutely no gratitude. The Americans were the same enemy as the Russians. They were both decadent infidels. The American help actually lead to disruption of the country, increased the production of drugs, lead from communistic dictatorship to the theocratic dictatorship, provided the safe ground for Islamic terrorists and finally destabilized the region including the Pakistan.In the tactical level the ""help"" was a success. But it was the same success as was the success of Enron or Worldcom - short time success followed by the catastrophic collapse. From the long term point of view it would be better to keep Russians in Afghanistan to repair the infrastructure from their own pocket and let them bleed slowly. The Russians could not afford long time ""help"" for financial reasons - the same reasons that Americans cannot afford to ""stay and help"" in Iraq and Afghanistan.The movie was created as a celebration of the success, but more or less it should be presented as a warning. Al-Qaeda is the creation of Charlie Wilson. When you ask who did 9/11 - Charlie did it! Your enemy may defeat another enemy of yours, but in the end he will remain to be your enemy. He will be just better armed and trained than ever.",Charlie Wilson's War
123,Hancock_the_Superb,"Intelligent, witty ""dramedy"" with one serious flaw",8,29 June 2008,"Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a hard-partying, womanizing Texas Congressman with no discernible legislative record. In 1980, he finds himself becoming interested in the plight of Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the USSR. On the auspices of his old flame, arch-conservative Texas socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), he travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation, and is stunned by what he sees. He returns to the US determined to help the Afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and himself under investigation for allegations of drug use. Undeterred, Wilson recruits Herring and the vulgar, outcast CIA Agent Gust Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to begin a convoluted arms deal involving Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and a mostly unknowing US Congress. Ultimately, the Afghans defeat the Soviets, but while America celebrates their victory, Wilson and Avrakotos find their warnings about the instability of post-war Afghanistan falling on deaf ears.Charlie Wilson's War is slick brain candy, a really neat film for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average film-goer. The movie assembles an astonishing array of talent, both in front of and behind the camera, and delivers on its promise of being one hell of a good time. The film's has only one flaw, which we'll arrive at later. As an examination of the improbable way in which the 20th Century's largest covert war was waged - and, perhaps, the way that things get done by the CIA and other intelligence agencies - it's fascinating.The movie is interesting on a number of levels. The story portrayed in the movie - with all of its outrageous double-dealings, sneaky covert operations, and, perhaps most of all, its success - would be so outrageous as a work of fiction, that it could easily be dismissed as a satire. But things really did work out this way, at least within reasonable bounds. The film portrays our three protagonists in an interesting way that highlights their virtues without obscuring their flaws. Wilson as a person who is unapologetic about his vices (even embracing them) - yet willing to embrace a righteous cause. Herring is something of an elitist, and her born-again attitude of righteousness is off-putting - yet she's deeply committed to the cause of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is a CIA outsider with an attitude problem, looked down upon because of his ""street"" background - yet his love of country and hatred of Communism are unwavering. The fact that this odd trio could play a major role in the downfall of the USSR is not only proof that anyone can make a difference, but also that truth is stranger than fiction. It's also very interesting that all of this is played as a comedy - not too surprising, given that our writer is Aaron Sorkin, but it's an interesting way to approach this story.The movie does, however, have one drawback, which is a bit surprising. The film seems to unabashedly celebrate Wilson and Co.'s achievement. This is fine - nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, is there? - until one considers that out of the ashes of the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan came the Taliban and eventually al-Qaeda. Regardless of the US's level of responsibility, it happened, and the movie's portrayal of Wilson's success is almost unmitigated. To be fair, the movie does address this issue towards the end, with a rather topical speech by Wilson about the US's inability to clean up after themselves, but it's done in such a tertiary manner that the average viewer will probably not take much from it. The overall impression will be that these three remarkable people helped the Afghans defeat the Soviets. This isn't a fatal drawback, mind you, but it's one troubling aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie. The film's talent is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols delivers a slick, gorgeous-looking production; the material is perfectly suited to his understated, wry directorial style. Sorkin delivers yet another brilliant screenplay; the film has dozens of quotable lines and classic Sorkin exchanges (the best being the ""Scotch bottle"" discussion between Wilson and Avrakotos), and keeps something of a political and historical perspective behind it. The film's cast is a marvel: Tom Hanks gives a fine performance as the lovable rogue with a cause, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the obnoxious but committed Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene (par usual) as the abrasive Gus. The always-lovely Amy Adams takes another step on her road to stardom as Wilson's long suffering assistant, and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham, and Ken Stott flesh out the supporting cast.Charlie Wilson's War is an intelligent and fun movie, a wonderful bit of a-bit-more-than-light entertainment. The fact that it decides not to be more than that shouldn't be held against it; it's brilliant at what it does.8/10",Charlie Wilson's War
124,son_of_cheese_messiah,Smart but superficial,7,14 April 2012,"On one level the makers of this are to be commended for making what could be potentially a dry story accessible to a wide audience. Aaron Sorkin is a very smart and witty writer and his skill in constructing memorable scenes is everywhere evident. For example, the scene which of Wilson's meeting with the CIA man when they are constantly interrupted by Wilson's staff plays very much like a French farce and is wittily engaging.On the other hand, there is a mishmash between the light witty treatment and the complex and serious subject matter. Rather than realistic character development and exploration of the deeper political themes, Sorkin emphases sexual titillation, smart alec dialogue and other gimmicks. For instance, when the CIA man first appears, he rather arbitrarily breaks the glass of his boss's office (surely a dismissible of offense?) and when we are introduced to the head of intelligence it is while he is playing three simultaneous games of chess. Since this character is never again seen, this is an unnecessary distraction.The wisdom of arming Islamic fanatics is never seriously questioned in the film. Instead it is viewed as an unambiguously good thing. The climax, with Mujahadeen downing some Russian helicopters, is shot over uplifting Handelian music and rejoicing Afghans, with the only downside being America's failure in 'the endgame' which is very briefly shoehorned in at the end.The reduction of such complex political themes to a lot of bed hopping and superficial dialogue may not be ideal, but the film is highly entertaining when taken on its own terms.",Charlie Wilson's War

Zen Philosophy? The bullshit American system and attitude? How it was not all bullshit today, but was so ever since? I picked this movie off the shelf because I kind of like Tom Hanks usually, but this is definitely not the best piece of work he's been in. Again what are they trying to point out. The ugly side of war? We know about that. What? Political relations, especially on a religious theme? How democratic America is and all that. America before 9/11 I guess. I guess I most enjoyed Philip Seymour Hoffman's role most in this film.

126,screenwriter-14,"""You're not stupid...you're just in congress""",7,25 December 2007,"CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a Dramedy which attempts to ""Americanize"" the travesty which is Afghanistan, but only succeeds because of the brilliant humor and deadpan delivery of Philip Seymour Hoffman, along with the excellence of Tom Hanks. Julia Roberts ""in a blonde wig"" did nothing for me, and could have been played by an actress such as Michelle Pfeiffer with glamor and a touch of compassion and believability as a Houston socialite with brains and beauty.However, as one reviews the excellence of THE KITE RUNNER in delivering a powerful story of Afghanistan and the horrors of what the Russians and Taliban have done to the country, the frat boy humor of Charlie Wilson began to become a bit tiresome, along with the cadre of female office workers, which really represent the tawdriness of America.

Tom Hanks plays the main characters in this movie and he did a great job in this role. The storyline, plot, characters, character development are all really good and well done in this movie. Tom Hanks always pick great movies to be in. This is no expectation. The movie was great. There is belly dancing, some action but not really much, politics, Sex, talk of war in this movie. This is not very child friendly movie. So when everyone gets old enough to be able to watch it they should watch this. It not a 18+ movie but more like a 10+ movie or 12+ movie.

Tom Hanks and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are spectacular in their parts, with just enough witty banter between the two to keep your interest when the film is processing through the necessary political moments. Julia Roberts is her usual beautiful and driven self, the kind of woman who may sleep with you, as long as its on her terms. Amy Adams is wonderful as the senior administrative assistant, a woman with an incredible body and the brains to match.

Australians will love this film that simplifies and condemns the Soviet Invasion occupation of Afghanistan whilst provided absolutely no insight as to why it happened. America's involvement bu giving Afghanistan military assistance was factual but it had nothing to do with a scrawny Texan female who supported a republican Congressman. In the film we see women and children running from a sophisticated soviet aircraft strafing and yet you never see women and chi8ldren on the street of Afghanistan especially at this point of history. The attempt to distort history and show America as complete idiots for supporting the Afghanistan who then turned on them as the Taliban is totally false and its happened to many countries and the UN who have supported nations who have then become aggressive monsters like the Taliban. No mention is made of the Taliban Opium fields and the clandestine activities of Al Qaeda. The illusion that American foreign Policies are decided by a handful of corrupt hedonistic one dimensional individuals is total rubbish and Aaron Sorkin and George Crile who wrote the screenplay and book respectively obviously know the anti-American market quite well. There are great acting performances by Tom hanks who plays the Congressman Charlie Wilson , Julia Roberts who plays the wealthy Houston women who supports the congressman and Philip Seymour Hoffman who plays the secret service adviser to Charlie Wilson. There are also some very good war scenes and as I said Australians will especially love the Anti-American theme.

What a well-scripted, snappy witty film! If ever there's an argument for the writers on strike deserving better payment, it's scripts like this one, courtesy of Aaron Sorkon. Listening to pros like Tom Hanks and Phillip Seymour Hoffman speak it is about as good as it gets. Hanks does quite well as the charismatic and dumb-like-a-fox Charlie Wilson. He fools around with drugs, liquor, and women, and yet is capable of great acts. So human of him. These faults should not estrange him from audiences, but enhance his appeal. People's (and politicians) personal lives should not make such a big mark on their image, but rather the things they do and the ideas they stand for.Hoffman steals almost every scene he's in as Gust Avrakotos, a sarcastic and slick CIA worker (his first scene is so good I'm tempted to re-watch the movie in cinema for that scene). Of course Julia Roberts had to come in and break up the winning streak. Her southern accent is inconstant, her hair just as fake (is it so unbearable to dye eye-brows? Her hair sticks out as much as Jake Gyllenhall's dumb-ass mustache in Brokeback). She continues to dismay me by being one of the most over-paid of Hollywood's A-listers.Roberts is the one false note in a very good movie that could not have been made even 4 years ago.

Though some Athletes did go, they were later barred from representing their countries. On a irregular basis, I read what was taking place in that country. But then, suddenly, the Mujhahideen became strong and they were shooting down Soviet Helicopters and jets, as well as destroying items such as Tanks.A Texas Congressman, Charlie Wilson, while watching news on the Television, learns of the news of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the atrocities that are occurring in the country. He then, decides to have the funding increased from 5 million US Dollars to 10 million. But soon he gets further involved after he is shown a clip by a friend of his, Joanne Herring, at a party and decides to go to Pakistan to see the situation for himself. Here he realises that more than 10 million dollars are needed, as well as weapons and sophisticated weapons.""Charlie Wilson's War,"" based on the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, stars Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts and Bollywood actor, Om Puri and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Tom Hanks, plays the role of the Congressman very well and in certain scenes one can feel the intensity in his acting, as is Hoffman as the CIA man ""Gus Avrakotos."" Julia Roberts still looks stunning as ever, even though she pregnant at the time of filming. Lastly, Bollywood actor, Om Puri, also performs well as ""General Zia - Ul Haq,"" the Pakistani leader, who over threw the father of the late and former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated recently,Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose name is mentioned in the movie once. He was hanged in the late 1970's. The weapons that were mentioned in the movie, such as the ""SA"" Stinger missiles, later were used in the 1999 Kargil conflict, when some Mujhadeen men, illegally crossed the Line of Control between India and Pakistan, supported by the Pakistani Northern Light Infantry, against India.Though the movie does have some faults, and, if you are fan of Tom Hanks, and also if you like Political / action stories and movies, then this one is worth watching.",Charlie Wilson's War

But what I really loved is that, based on all the reading I've done now, it seems to be about 99% true. Another novel idea. No matter how bizarre, complicated, exciting and interesting history is, Hollywood screenwriters always seem to think they can make it better. Not Sorkin. He just told it as it was, because if the facts weren't true, who would believe it? It is just amazing how the entire world revolves around the people of Texas. Who would have thought? Why not Tenn.?

In ""Charlie Wilson's War"" the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are at the service of something else, it's personal only to a point. Hanks has to bury his brilliance in single malts and Julia Roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant straightforwardness. Amy Adams witnesses and exist as a character, witnessing. An insurmountable task that Miss Adams manages to surmount, beautifully. It is Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gus with a t, however, that monopolized my attention. His character may not be a first but it is a first the way that Hoffman presented him to us. Someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together. Hoffman is superb.

136,blackburnj-1,Hilarious and thought-provoking,9,16 January 2008,"Mike Nichols and Aaron Sorkin construct a thoroughly entertaining, open minded and thought-provoking film. Foreign policy may not be everybody's cup of tea, but this is hilarious and intelligent fare that will satisfy.The story sounds like it must be made up but apparently the film is pretty accurate. A US congressman quietly manages to make the budget for assisting Afghan resistance to the Soviet invasion rocket up and, by doing so, aide bring about the end of the Cold War. The last part is overplayed a little bit, as this seems to be the plan from the start, but its failings are forgivable as this film uses humour and thought to amuse and say something important.The message of the film is clear even though it presumes that the audience will bring the weight of current affairs to bear on it. The film points out that we should never assume that things will work out and that you have to work at the endgame. It also cleverly points out that not all is black and white. The cause of the Afghans in this film is clearly a good one, and we all know what it produced.The comedy is wonderfully brought to life. Mike Nichols obviously knows what he is doing, as does Tom Hanks who delivers a wonderful performance. However, he almost has the film stolen from him by Philip Seymour Hoffman who, as expected, is pitch perfect and a scene stealer every time. Julia Roberts is also impressive, as is Amy Adams as Wilson's chief secretary. All of them are served well by Sorkin's electric script. His dialogue is at the usual Sorkin-standard and he once again uses his talent at making quite complicated ideas filter into dialogue and become easily digested by the audience.But, whilst the film is utterly satisfying, it doesn't give off the sense of being an all time classic.

137,colonel_green,Quality entertainment for adults.,8,22 December 2007,"This new release from director Mike Nichols and writer Aaron Sorkin, starring Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It focuses on the titular Congressman Charlie Wilson (D-TX) (Hanks), known as ""Good Time Charlie"" for his swinging lifestyle, who becomes the key player in getting the US government to fund the Afghan resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 80s.It's an interesting movie; not as witty as Sorkin's The West Wing (although there are a couple of long-take scenes set in hallways), but there's a lot of humour, although the subject-matter is serious. As drama it's rather sedate (a bit like ""Good Night, and Good Luck""), and the storyline doesn't really have any inherent conflict for the heroes to overcome, but I didn't notice this until a review pointed it out; most of the movie just documents the actions of the three principle characters and their interactions.The performances are quite good, too, although Hanks as a womanizing drunk can be a bit of a hard-sell (in some scenes he looks a bit uncertain about how much enjoyment to play Charle as having in all his antics). One place Hanks unquestionably succeeds is his accent; Hanks is a rarity in that he is a major film star who can adopt an accent for a whole movie without it seeming a gimmick; Charlie's Texas twang is as believable as Forrest's Alabama schtick or Viktor's pseudo-Eastern Europe tone. Julia Roberts (in the first major role I've seen her in in a while) is good as a the conservative socialite who interests Charlie in the cause of the Afghans, and Hoffman is dynamite as Gus, the CIA operative assigned to the Afghan desk.",Charlie Wilson's War
138,bjones,Great true story,9,25 September 2010,"It should be sufficient to say that this film is based upon a book that was based on hard facts. The major characters portrayed are/were all quite real. But, as with things from the entertainment industry, the fill in is all fiction, but brilliantly done.I have a very personal reason to adore this film, which is why I did not review it when it was first released; feeling I was too prejudiced. But time has not taken the shine off the apple so I'll add my humble endorsement. This is a wonderful film that does an excellent job of portraying the kinds of very real people who constantly swim against the current in Washington to accomplish very great things. All of these people feel very real to me, exactly like a lot of people I knew in my career of nearly 40 years working in and around the Defense Department. I am especially taken with the performance of Philip Seymour Hoffman who portrays a character who very much reminds me of me. I was also involved in a small capacity with the events portrayed in this film, so, how could I not love it. Although all of the performances in this film were outstanding, I did enjoy Hoffman's the most for obvious reasons of personal prejudice. Hoffman is a truly brilliant actor. However, the remaining cast is equally superb. Tom hanks portrays the odd character of Charlie Wilson in a most entertaining way. Next in enjoyment to me was Amy Adams who portrays Wilson's Administrative Assistant. She is not only a fantastic talent - as all of her other roles certainly prove - but treated me to one of the most sensual scenes I've yet seen in any film - the simple scene of her, from the back, walking down a hallway in Washington, her pony tail keeping time to her magnificently swaying hips and stunning legs. I truly wished the hallway had been longer; and please, I do not want to know if she was a stand-in, a guy's gotta have some fantasies.Emily Blunt gave a somewhat surprising performance, itself quite sensual in one scene that certainly shows her to just about the best advantage I've seen of her. I don't think I've ever seen a sofa better adorned. Seriously, she is such a terrific actress she illuminates any film she graces with her presence.Possibly the most dynamic performance, and of the one person who probably should get the lion's share of the credit for the success of the whole Afghan operation, was by Julia Roberts as Texas Socialite Joanne Herring. Combining beauty, intelligence and genuine concern for the betterment of the world. Robert's performance was flattering to all such women.The film is peppered with a lot of talented people, all adding to the flavor of this very fine stew. Some others were Om Puri as the President of Pakistan, John Slattery as Hoffman's insipid boss (I've known way too many of his type for real), Ned Beatty as a Congressman, Peter Gerety as one of Wilson's constituents (and Blunt's father), Christopher Denham as the young but gifted CIA weapons expert, Denis O'Hare as a typical cake-eater, Tracy Phillips as a belly dancer and last but certainly not least, the stunning Rachel Nichols, Mary Bonner Baker (a real politician's daughter), Wynn Everett and Shiri Appleby (how could you not like a character named Jailbait?) As Charlie's Angels - his office staff.The other necessary elements of the film were done with great care to create a proper atmosphere and was done with great effectiveness. All the films scenes seemed true to the story, helping to make viewing this film an especially pleasant entertainment experience.Bravo!By Bruce L.

140,simonparker1990,Informative but fun at the same time,10,16 January 2008,"Tom Hanks is one of my all time favourite actors, if a movie is made starring Tom Hanks, or Johnny Depp, I am pretty much guaranteed to see that movie. Toy Story 1 and 2, Castaway, Saving Private Ryan (okay not perfect but good), Philadelphia, whatever the movie Hanks pretty much delivers a killer performance. That and I genuinely like the man, he seems a nice guy. Even when I saw him on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross the other night I couldn't help but smile and think just how great a person he seems. For that reason I was looking forward to seeing Charlie Wilson's War, despite the trailer seeming like the movie could plod. Today I chose to see this over No Country For Old Men, I don't know how good Country is yet but I am very glad I saw Charlie Wilson. This movie is just fantastic. I have read some reviews being a bit nit picky, but I was just very impressed by the movie. Its extremely refreshing to find a movie about politics that doesn't seem to drone on for eternity, the movie is an accessible 97 minutes and goes by in a flash. Oh and did I mention the movie is funny, very funny? This is part of the movies success, for every talking sequence there is a laugh, and sometimes the laughs fit in the middle of a talking scene. The movie is just a fun film while at the same time still informing the audience. The performances are also amazing, Hanks just being as brilliant as ever, Seymour-Hoffman being superb and Julia Roberts making a welcome return to our screens. Charlie Wilson's War is also one of those movies I'd like to see get an Oscar nomination, I doubt it will, the Academy always seems to love the drearier and longer movies, but it would be nice for the movie to get some recognition.Tom Hanks is the big star of the movie as Charlie Wilson. While this isn't his best performance ever he seems to be doing very well in the movie. He actually seems closer to playing Tom Hanks than anything else, and its works extremely well. He has great chemistry with all of the cast and has some really brilliant lines. He also shows the comedic timing he has displayed in many of his films. But despite Hanks being on top form in this movie he is quite easily overshadowed by another one of my favourite actors at the moment. Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman showed his talent in Capote when he quite deservedly won his Oscar, and in my eyes I think he will be walking off with another Oscar this year for his performance in this movie. Hoffman is a hoy to watch as the foul mouthed CIA agent. He has all the best lines in the movie, the best scenes in the movie, and the best presence in the film. Whenever he appears on screen the movie moves to another level of greatness. Julia Roberts makes a welcome return to films in this movie, admittedly she has little to do, but she delivers a relatively good performance and she has great chemistry with Tom Hanks. Amy Adams shows up in an unfortunately underused role, but she shows that great talent like she did in Enchanted. The rest of the cast are equally up to an incredibly high standard.As I have previously mentioned part of the success of Charlie Wilson's War has to be the blend of comedy in the political drama side. In fact for the first hour the movie resembles a comedy at times. The movie makes a shift into more dramatic territory towards the end, but that benefits the film greatly. The ending in fact is pitch perfect although I am aware it will split crowds easily. Thankfully in this movie the usually elongated talking sequences are spiced up with witty dialogue and some great performances. The spark of fun is a welcome relief as well, in fact this is possibly one of the most accessible political dramas I have ever seen, which is a good thing as political dramas tend to be films that think they are a lot smarter than they are. The movies length helps proceedings as the movie is anything but dull, the film movies along at a brisk pace informing you all the way. In fact this movie also doesn't feel like a dull history lesson, rather a movie that makes you interested in the history, a very good thing as way too many films make the mistake of lecturing to you rather than letting you make your own mind up. This is anything but a god bless America flick, sure the movie has times when America is the hero, but there are other times when you disagree. Its a smart flick worthy of a lot of peoples attentions.Charlie Wilson's War is the first movie of 2008 to earn a 10/10 rating and is a very enjoyable movie and has a high chance of showing up on the top ten list at the end of the year. A smart but funny political drama that will make you think and laugh at the same time.",Charlie Wilson's War

Still, it's a good geopolitical flick, full of action, humor, and sex.Think of James Bond Goes to the US Congress and you'll get the basic flavor. Not bad ... but frankly, not all that good, either. I myself made the mistake of approaching this movie with overarching expectations based on the cast, and on the movie's capture of an amazing 5 Golden Globe nominations.However, from my angle, the movie turned out to be an OK flick. OK, but a movie that doesn't deserve to be burdened with expectations that it just can't fulfill.The storyline - about a Congressman who singlehandedly organizes the defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and thereby brings about American victory in the Cold War - is not really more incredible than any National Treasure or Die Hard storyline. But it's not better, either.Similarly, the script wasn't outstanding, but it delivered the storyline and delivered it well: fast-paced, with great action, great dialog, cool humor, and plenty of alcohol and sex.The cast - especially Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, and Philip Seymour Hoffman - was stellar. These, and all supporting actors and actresses, turned in good, competent performances: nothing more, but nothing less, either.Cinematography was solid and competent, again, no more, and no less.All in all, I'd recommend this movie to anyone who would like a good, quick geopolitical flick with lots of action and humor.

144,das417,An Unlikely American Hero,8,16 June 2008,"Congressman Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a dedicated, if unorthodox, member of Congress who loves his country as much as he loves women and alcohol. A hedonist if there ever was one, Charlie Wilson has a dedicated mindset that is perhaps surprising given his rather loose and undisciplined approach to life and politics in general. However this Texan, who comes from an unimportant district, will find himself in the center of Cold War and the fate of a small and seemingly unimportant Asian country known as Afganistan. There, in a land of rugged mountains, unforgivable deserts, and a fiercely violent people, Charlie Wilson will become an unlikely hero whose actions will not only change the course of Afghan History but the world as well.After learning of the Soviet invasion into the small country, Charlie finds his interest of the situation growing. Of course pressure by Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) who is one of the richest women in Texas, a staunch anti-Communist, and lover of Charlie's, only gives him a greater interest in the struggle of the tribal Afghans against the modern day army of the Soviet Union. It is a concern that only grows as Charlie eventually visits one of the many Afghan refugee camps across the border in Pakistan that moves him to a committed vow of defeating the Soviets and supporting the Afghans freedom fighters known as the Mujahadeen.To help both Charlie Joanne is Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is a dedicated, but frustrated, CIA officer who now finds himself in a dead end situation within the agency. The Afghan assignment seems small at first but with support from Charlie Gust now finds himself involved in one of the world's most important secret wars. Impressive for an agent who is known within the agency for insubordination.Charlie's, Joanne's, and Gust's efforts will lead everywhere from Washington, Pakistan, Egypt, Israel and Afganistan itself. US aid is enough to not only support the Afghans but to eventually defeat the Soviet Army. Charlie is hailed a hero by both the CIA and the Afghans for his efforts and his recognized as doing something that no one years earlier thought possible. However, even in the midst of his victory, Charlie will soon taste ash when he realizes that Washington has no further use for the Afghans once the Soviets withdraw. Charlie Wilson is irresponsible but he is also enough of a realist to know that his actions, while bringing a great victory, have also brought an unfortunate consequence that he is in some ways responsible for.Based upon the true efforts of the real Charlie Wilson, the movie portrayal is full of dark humor, wit, but also hard political realities. Tom Hanks and Philip Seymour Hoffman standout as two unlikely heroes who, despite their good intentions, are very flawed characters.

There is no acknowledgment that the funding of the Afghan rebels led directly to the formation of Al-Qaeda and all that followed. Maybe Wilson et al, are indirectly responsible for all that?So, I now wonder how these people, Wilson and Herring especially, can look themselves in the mirror or show their faces in public. Or maybe America would rather gloat over their ""victory"" over the Soviets?But there is merit in the writing, some great gags, some subtle twists, some quotable lines, the saddest being at the very end, where there is a tiny hint that maybe it might not really achieve what they all thought it was going to.",Charlie Wilson's War
146,legendaryunderdog,Philip Seymour Hoffman was the backbone of this movie......,7,30 April 2008,"Tom Hanks performance as congressman Charlie Wilson was fabulous (I never expect anything less than perfect acting from Mr. Hanks) but Philip Seymour Hoffman as Gust Avratados was amazing, he had the greatest dialogue I have ever heard in a movie. His performance alone should be Oscar-worthy in my opinion, extremely-intelligent and not afraid to say how it is, boy did he capture that role beautifully! Julia Roberts character 'Joanna' was interesting, its a first for me to see Miss/Mrs. Roberts in a feisty role as Mr. Wilson's 'fling'. I fell in love with all three characters (Seymours the most) but overall I think this picture treated the political underlings of this story very well and provided a great comedic feel to it as well. I have never been one to watch movies of this type (political genre) but I was comfortable watching this movie from beginning to end. A lot of old clips of Dan Rather from the early eighties provided a great backdrop to the story, to me it gave the viewer a feel for what it was like at that time in politics. The crap that Mr. Wilson has to endure is at times amusing but his character was portrayed beautifully by the great Tom Hanks. Two Thumbs Up for Mr. Hanks, Miss/Mrs. Roberts and Mr. Hoffmans performances. Seven out of Ten Stars, mild nudity but nothing too over the top, colorful language to say the least but the compelling dialogue overrides that stuff. Enjoy!",Charlie Wilson's War
147,lopcar1993,An awesome movie experience!,8,21 September 2009,"Charlie Wilson's war is a movie about a playboy congressman who finally wakes up to the seriousness of war that is plaguing Afghanistan, so he aims to do something about, he plans to launch the biggest and most secretive covert operation in history.This was a film I like form the opening scene it was fresh, smart, original, daring, funny, heart warming and dare I say it. Inspirational. This movie was very good in the way it played out and it convinces you that even the most self-centered and non ambitions person can become a hero to many(too bad it was to a nation that later attacked us.) It's premise is something new that hasn't been done quite this way before, it turns an egotistical, playboy, have a good time, congressman into a real man instead of the man-boy he was in the beginning.Tom Hanks turns in an impressive and dynamic performance as the real life Charlie Wilson and Phillip Seymour Hoffman follows right along with him but is even more dynamic and astounding then Hanks is. The only let down in this films is Julia Roberts, her performance was awful and quite annoying but still actually good. Amy Adams who I thought was great but should have had a bigger part she brings an innocents and grace to this films sexual and sometimes Violent themes(I have zero problem with violence) but she gives the film a spark of style and charm and really brings up this film in a very positive way.As for the story, the story was amazing Mike Nichols brings out the parts of this odd ball sequences of events and turns into an even more odd ball dramedy that is both eye and mind candy. It's a glorious exultation of grandeur and style and of one man's journey form being a nobody to being a somebody and how you can change things around you if you just give it a shot.It's a great zero to hero story that you can enjoy again and again and each time you see it you'll have the same feeling of patriotism and glory that Senator Wilson felt. It's a film that you can't overlook. All in all Charlie Wilson's War is one fight you want to be part of.",Charlie Wilson's War
148,beregic,morality mess in its most sneaky form,3,20 April 2008,"after hearing many positive thoughts of how funny this is and also because tom hanks(in his early performances i might add) i decided to see it.also because it deals with Afghanistan and overall American military and political presence in foreign countries. it took me less then 30 minutes to see where this goes and after completing it i came to the conclusion that this is nothing but a propagandistic feature to justify, to the American public , certain aspects of how the world SHOULD be run. i actually find it disgusting in a specific aspect: that of giving the ""average"" American politician an imagine of ""well intentioned child"" by admitting that mistakes are being made. but those mistakes are not apparently made out of political form but that of a ""human"" one. basically this tells me that ""they"" are just like us conveniently forgetting the huge amount of power and INFORMATION they hold and WITHOLD from the general public. i will not go in details since one has to make up his/her own mind about this.but the viewer using his own practical day to day observations make me confident that will see throw the whole facade made up here. if you remember the older movie ""wag the dog"" with Robert De Niro, you will see how that feature PREDICTED this one...simply amazing.Julia Roberts and tom hanks give a GREAT performance, and i would have liked them if their intentions would have been honest. but there is that ""something"", which makes me believe that their names were used to make this look human and funny, and i wont be surprised if their paychecks were bigger then usual for this specific roles. Julia Roberts especially portrays one of the most dangerous, behind the scene, reality ; that of mixing politics and religion. true that the screenplay trays to put her character aside but just in ""that"" typical manner of actually giving it even more power to this specific faith based groups she represents. for some reasons it feels like the screenwriter condones the ""positive"" effects Inquisition has had apparently in the past. oh my...tom hanks is sinking lower and lower in my opinion, simply capitalizing too much lately on his name as a ""serious"" drama actor ever since ""castaway""(""the terminal"" was his last outstanding role for me).about his acting here, at time it seems that himself is not comfortable with the role he HAS to play because his sarcasm seems to be that of an actor knowing his own ""lies"".from the point of production, there are many flaws and somehow they feel to me as intentioned (convulsive plot with convenient misses) in confusing the viewer and give him an idea that this could be too ""complex"" for him to understand.overall , just be aware of the implications given here; while entertaining from a sarcastic point of view, this is not at all what was advertised as would be.",Charlie Wilson's War

He is worth the ticket price alone in a supremely entertaining performance as maverick CIA agent Gust Avrakatos, but he is not the only good thing about this film, an odd fusion of drama and comedy in which Tom Hanks is also very enjoyable as the titular congressman Wilson. Some reviews suggested the film was uneven, but I enjoyed the whole package  the serious bits were serious, the sad were sad and the funny were hilarious  and some scenes were all three. What more do you want?

151,alexkolokotronis,"""Well See....."" said the Zen Master",7,31 May 2008,"Well we definitely did see and I and many other people were actually expecting worse. It did have some good parts too it that I was not expecting it still did fail in other areas though.First off the acting was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue to this movie. If it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom. His performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary. He gave a good witty, cynical performance in what most other actors could have easily made his character into a cliché. Tom Hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint but he certainly did not impress. What I could not stand was that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. She was as big of a miscast as I have ever seen. For one she is a bad actress, at least to me, she was to young for her character and was to phony even for the character she was playing.The directing was average to me. I'm not really a big fan of the recent Mike Nichols movies and I'm not exactly impressed by this one either. It was made with such a Hollywoodish, cartoonish touch hat I could not stand. The worst part about it was that he tried make it be a really meaningful movie at the end. I love meaningful movies but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the whole movie. That is something that Mike Nichols has seemed to have done a lot in his recent track record.The one impressive part of this movie was the writing. The dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out. The writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level. In so many scenes I found myself laughing in part by the writing.Well that is some of what we saw at least. A lot of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what I mean but not a lot other than that. I did like that this movie did not glorify everything America had done. It is obvious that during this whole war in Afghanistan the U.S. gave weapons to the people who are now against us. This movie kind of show we are too blame for that. It shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something horribly wrong in the future. This movie did have a good original message but it just did not deliver it right. Overall though it was entertaining.",Charlie Wilson's War
152,GethinVanH,American history - re-written,6,24 October 2008,"There's great acting by Hanks and Hoffman but I'm cutting my rating back a bit for the chest-beating nationalism. Hoffman is always a pleasure to watch on screen but I much prefer him as a starring character now instead of a supporting character.The irony that's never mentioned is that the armed Afghanis returned and blew the crap out of the US. The fact is only eluded to once or twice but it would have been nice to make it more apparent. The fact that the armed rebels in Afghanistan were also women-hating zealot religious dictators is also not really eluded to.This kind of movie supports the theory that the ends justify the means. Stopping the Soviets from taking over the country was the main concern, and anything that happens afterward is ignored.It's all typically shy American juxtaposition. It's too difficult to say anything specifically about America's current role in the middle east, so it's easier to say it through the Afghanistan/Soviet war of the 80s. This is done pretty frequently. Think ""MASH"" and what it said about Vietnam through its setting in the Korean war.",Charlie Wilson's War
153,lizziebeth-1,A little below par when compared to Aaron Sorkin's television work.(8/10),8,15 May 2009,"Philip Seymour-Hoffman has arrived. As CWW's wise but ill-fitting CIA analyst, he's a finally matured, sardonic powerhouse.Certainly, CWW enjoys an impeccable cast and terrific performances, inspired by such a generous Aaron Sorkin script. John(Where's Marlowe(1998), ""Mad Men""(TV)) Slattery's timing is pitch-perfect dancing with PSH, while Denis O'Hare is the perfect ""massive tool"" and Om Puri the most measured/culturally accurate ""straight man"" in the ""Pakistani Vaudeville Team"". Ken Stott(""Rebus""(TV)) is seemingly cast for his deadpan reactions and the silly timbre of his voice; this plays against the fear the mere mention of Mossad typically invokes in their Western counterparts.Sorkin's ""crackerjack"" screenplay successfully personalizes the spooks while quietly giving away little-known CIA history. Chief tidbit is how President Carter's DCI, Admiral Stansfield Turner, during his 1977-1981 tenure shockingly dismissed 3,000 career CIA officers alleging their ""unpatriotism"". This truly controversial decision left the remaining spooks mostly ""old school"" Princeton Ivy Leaguers--implied by Gust's line ""...you poncy schoolboy""--but it also rendered toothless the CIA's ""humint"" apparatus. Coupled with subsequent politicization of the remaining ""sigint"" capability, this decision has since delivered America its embarrassing ""intelligence failures"".Post-TV, Sorkin sought another outlet for his complex scripts. Based on Crile's 10-yr-long agonized-over novel, this relatively short screenplay even delivers some of the snappiest dialogue in the business, but ITS ENDING is let down in editing.CWW's ""dramedy"" balancing-act hinges on successfully depicting a flippant and unethical playboy/Congressman from Texas as lovable as the real man was. Complicating this, the screenplay had to extend to the burden of hindsight, but it's UNreasonable for audiences to provide that for themselves.Although in the last 2mins of the main narrative Tom Hanks tries in his close-ups to project Charlie's sense of failure about ""the end game"", the screenplay and editing needed to do more. This was, after all, the raison d'etre of the film! Instead, we're allowed to perceive the film's truncated nature when a PROPER explanation for Charlie's crucial hindsight quote turns out to be missing. The story just fades out, unfinished after only 90mins, while the book-ender clangs it shut with Charlie's receipt of his ""Honoured Colleague"" Clandestine Services(spook) award. Consequently, Sorkin's cinematic adaptation plays as watered-down, and the closing book-ender too pat.George Crile's 416-page same-titled book first noted that Charlie""...had a genius for getting people to judge him not as a middle-aged scoundrel, but instead as if he were a good-hearted adolescent, guilty of little more than youthful excess. This survival skill routinely permitted him to do things that no-one else in Congress could have gotten away with"". This of course was the key that unlocked Tom Hanks' characterization, but Charlie's misbehavior was grossly at odds with the actor's persona. The film therefore gently pillories Charlie's legal selectivity: when the strippers yell ""We love you, Charlie!"", Hanks mumbles ""Oh, it helps not to know me"". Charlie's warts-and-all portrayal is further peppered with his crass expressions--eg ""I like drinking women and chasing whiskey""--which Hanks cleaned up for the final cut.Largely due to Hanks' alchemy, the central conceit of Charlie's likability succeeds and completely sells the story to audiences who've never heard any of this before, but a few additional elements do fail: Hanks' ""Were you listening at my door?!?"" line, for instance, delivered 3x, totally disrupts the pace just to ramp-up Gust's ""Don't be an idiot, I bugged the scotch bottle"" payoff. (Perhaps they couldn't slow Seymour-Hoffman down with a preceding ""Hell no""). Hanks also overindulges the ""...shoot down the helicopters"" line to prod the audience to that conclusion.The early scene with ""Larry""(Peter Gerety, in a hugely satisfying caricature of an overbearing, corrupt ""contributor"" who came to Washington to ""influence"" a Congressman WITH his daughter--that's her in the shirt and heels), is crucial for establishing the haughty Texas persona that even Charlie Wilson shared. His bedroom scene with the newly introduced Joanne Herring(Roberts, now an often over-familiar recourse) further reveals not only her deep relationship with Charlie (who owes her his seat in Congress), but that she isn't above manipulating his electorate as a ""contributor"" either. This then is the ""Helen-of-Troy"" face of corruption of the American legal system.(""One voate? Vhee hav menyi voates""...)This famously ""easy man to like"" proved to be a surprising White Knight while nobody was looking, but sadly, Charlie's $billion-funding bogged down with superpower loss-of-interest for nation-building. Unfortunately, just as Avrakotos' intel predicted, the surviving Afghani orphans of war, in the absence of society/hope, would become easy converts to fundamentalism and a fresh supply of dispossessed angry-young-men that the ""unspooled"" Islamists need(ed).Since career intel officers have occasion to know the ""bouncing ball"" of consequences only too well--they call it ""blowback""--Avrakotos realized that rebuilding Afghanistan was even more vital than kicking the Russians out was.The best defence against terrorism seems to be disallowing its fertile ground (prevention), no matter what non-secular text the unspooled are thumping. Socio-economic investment--Charlie's concept of the ""end game""/""exit strategy""--should never be left to one Congressman to convince a nation; hopefully this true story (Woodward, Bob(2005) Veil--The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981-1987) will finally impact America's ""patriots"". Being too-passionate haters of opposing political systems, amateur ""patriots"" forget that THERE ARE WORSE THINGS. Presidential catchphrases (""the Evil Soviet Empire"", ""Axis of Evil"") too should carry ""BUYER BEWARE"" disclaimers.Missing that, CWW shows Joanne Herring(Julia Roberts) being thoroughly cynical as she manipulates Doc Long(Ned Beatty) in Peshawar for money, but claims she only uses the religious talk because(...it works)/they ""need God on their side"". Charlie's cold-water comeback is a brilliant warning we must all heed: ""What's got Gust worried is that pretty soon God will be on BOTH SIDES!""(...because everybody will be dead).Ultimately, compared to Sorkin's TV work (West_Wing, Studio_60_on_the_Sunset_Strip), CWW is a little bellow par--for him. On the other hand, Charlie Wilson, the ""immature"" ""Congressman from Kabul"" actually deserves credit as a modern-day Scarlet Pimpernel. After 5 meaningless re-elections he finally found a sobering cause.(8/10)",Charlie Wilson's War
154,segacs,"A scathing attack on US foreign policy, disguised as comedy",7,26 January 2008,"Michael Moore, eat your heart out. You've got nothing' on Aaron Sorkin.Most of the reviews I've read of this movie missed the point by a mile. I've read criticism of the movie for being too light-hearted, for glorifying a terrible war and being too cheeky with the consequences. And I have to wonder, were they watching the same movie? Or were they simply taking it at face value, failing to notice that the entire movie was a thinly-veiled parody? Charlie Wilson's War is about a corrupt, live-hard-party-harder congressman from Texas (Hanks) who embodies just about all the negative qualities of humanity we can imagine. He chases and objectifies women, nearly gets brought down in a drug scandal, and freely admits his love of politics stems from the realization he could manipulate people. It's a movie about how he became a hero by almost single-handedly funding and fighting a covert war in Afghanistan that ultimately drove out the Soviet Army and helped trigger the collapse of the Soviet Union. And though the characters in the movie celebrate this ""achievement"", the movie itself, emphatically, does not.Hoffman, ironically, plays the voice of conscience. I say ironically, because he plays Gust Avrakotos, a corrupt, sardonic CIA agent who plays both sides and mostly encourages Wilson in his effort. But unlike Wilson, who, despite his smoothness, can be read as somewhat naive, Gust knows exactly what he is doing and seems to have a firm grasp of what the consequences could be. If anything, this makes him guiltier than Wilson, but he's also the only one to voice the film's true message aloud: ""We'll see"".That zen master speech that Hoffman delivers at the end of the movie felt a bit heavy-handed to me. But then, maybe I overestimated the movie's audience. Because it seemed like it was tacked on at the end to spell out to anyone who was left wondering that the entire movie was a reference to the events that led up to 9/11, and the short-sightedness of America's involvement in wars all over the world that backfired. Reading outside comments and reviews, though, maybe the speech wasn't enough, because I have to wonder why so few people seem to get it.A longtime fan of the West Wing, I have always admired Sorkin's lack of need to talk down to his audience. This movie might have struck the wrong balance: just smart enough to be witty, and just dumb enough to attract a massive audience more accustomed to Michael Moore-like, in-your-face criticism of foreign policy, rather than the light touch chosen here. That's why I believe this film has had such a hard time finding its audience.Of the two approaches, I still vastly prefer this one, though. A Moore film is poorly-researched, underhanded manipulative cheese, and I freely admit I can't stand the guy. But Charlie Wilson's War, despite its brief pandering to its far-left audience (was it really necessary to perpetuate the stereotypes about Jewish money and influence in Congress, Sorkin?) pulls off something neater, cleaner, and far more intelligent. When Wilson, who mostly plays his way through life, gets his heartstrings tugged by the refugees in Peshawar, it's not an appeal to the sympathy of the audience that we're witnessing, but rather, the cheap tactics that utterly sway a man so naive that he asks for alcohol from the president of Pakistan. Wilson, we are drawn to understand, is living proof why a little bit of knowledge - with a lack of perspective - can be a dangerous thing. Was it really Charlie Wilson's War? Or was it the war of those who manipulated Wilson to encourage the US short-sighted approach whereby the enemy of the enemy is (falsely and disastrously) considered to be a friend? The acting, of course, was spot-on. Hanks and Hoffman both nailed their roles to a T, and what's more, they were a real pleasure to watch on screen. Amy Adams does a great job with her role. The one person I felt was miscast was Julia Roberts. She was playing the ultimate symbol of everything this movie disagreed with, but she seemed too young and tentative to really pull it off. I would've liked to see someone else in her role.That aside, this is a fine film, with excellent dialogue and some real food for thought. I recommend it to those who can open their eyes enough to understand what is really being said here. 7/10.",Charlie Wilson's War
155,mike-925,"If We Could Get The Ruskies Interested in Afghanistan Again..,",5,24 December 2007,"Maybe the US could then hightail it out of both Afghanistan and Iraq. The movie is directed by Mike Nichols. But it doesn't particularly strike me as a Mike Nichols film. Its flabby and not funny in the clever way his films used to be funny. The problem is probably the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, head writer on the West Wing, not a particularly comic or well written series.Charlie Wilson is a small bean GOP Congressman from Texas, aged 53, in 1980 when he has an idea how to get the head of his subcommittee to up the amount of defense aid for Afghanistan from five million dollars to half a billion, equipping the Afghans with rocket launchers that could bring down Russian Helicopters that harass Afghan villagers to keep them in line. Wilson (Tom Hanks) does not appear to be consorting with the White House on this at all. Its the Reagan White House after all. Wilson consults with some CIA Beastie Boys led by Gus (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). Gus has an ordinary Joe background. He minces few words, is not particularly respectful toward Wilson, has a serious paunch, black horn rims and smokes.Wilson has to observe a protocol that compels him to get Russian rocket launchers captured by the Israelis, who have the largest collection of them in the world, having captured them from Israel's Arab enemies in the Middle East. American rockets cannot be used because the US must play by rules which say the American Govt. is not officially at war with the USSR, so the weapons can't be American. Gus and Wilson jump the Iraquis and the Egyptians through a few hoops in conferences with the Israelis, to equip the Afghans with some great weaponry. And Presto, the Helicopters are going down in large numbers every week.Wilson is in some tabloid trouble while arranging this, having been photographed by US Attorney Rudy Guliani's men in a limo, possibly sniffing cocaine. Wilson has an all female staff. His public relations woman is a trashily dressed number affectionately named Jailbait. The staff regularly punctuates his meetings on the Afghan Weapons matter with new developments in the cocaine and special interests investigation, with Jailbait regularly developing new PR responses to placate the omnivorous press. Gus thinks its a nice diversion, since no one is likely to believe this minor Texas Republican is conducting his own private war with Russia out of a desk drawer. Wilson's aw shucks Texas mien, overt sexism verging on pigginess, combined with a yen for Jack Daniels, is an easy cover for the private Arms Race he is conducting through a small house subcommittee.Julia Roberts plays a rich Texas contributor who both gets it on with Charlie, promotes Christian values and stages dinner parties for contributors willing to help fight the war in Afghanistan against them ungodly Ruskies. Its a frivolous role. Roberts plays it out almost by the numbers, but the main action is Charlie, Gus and the Beastie Boys.The real Charlie Wilson is 80 years old, retired from Congress and ailing. He's being interviewed on TV to provide publicity for the movie. The film has to shovel a lot of information at the audience to make them understand how the politics work.

The good stuff (i.e. the fall of Communism; the immediate relief of the Afghanis in the 80's) was Charlie Wilson---the bad consequences, well that was Reagan (or so it is hinted...) The party man who gets moral ---when he sees mutilated children in Afghanistan?Maybe if he had been able to sleep with some willing Afghani 19 year old girl---he would have been too busy to help the Afghanis. (Maybe if he hadn't been so busy sleeping around and taking drugs in the U.S., he might have used his apparently considerable political gifts to aid his country in many good ways.) In the U.S. Charlie Wilson devotes considerable time (in the film anyway) to slobber over and sometimes sleep with various barely legal females, as well as power woman Julia Roberts. He seems to target daughters of the religious (Christian, not Islamic - even good time Charlie knows where to draw the line). And he's pleased to slobber over a college girl who is a relation of George Washington - a 19 year law student in a ""slave sale"" dressed in a bikini. She smirks back.If you think all young females are for your personal consumption, particularly the daughters of the powerful or daughters of those you despise, this is the film for you.Just a few who ALL act as if jumping in bed with him was the highest goal of their lives: the 19 year old law student (of DAR blood) (in belly dancer sex slave attire), as well as his ""official"" stripper girlfriend, and the naked young prostitutes in the opening tub scene. Is there one young woman, be she stripper or student, who doesn't salivate over middleaged Charlie? The mostly ""soulless sluts"" who decorate this film --the naked hot tub women, the college students, or the low cleavage smart slut office staff --can anyone say ""self respect"" or ""file a sexual harassment suit""??? Someone (Politician Charlie Wilson says) saved him from the ""prolife"" guys. But he is ""prolife"" for the children he sees whose arms were chopped off by Russians.Wonder how many of his offspring - were cut off before they could live a life??? (We have eight children in our family - who mostly were conceived by ""good time"" guys - someone else pays for the Charlie Wilsons of our world!) Yes, the dialogue is good. (except for all the times they fill gaps with the ""f"" word) Philip Seymour Hoffman is good as the streetwise CIA guy who helps Wilson pull off the covert aid to Afghanistan...He is the best actor in the film. He is so good, that even as a fellow middleaged actor, he doesn't need bimbos or the constant ""F"" word they put in his dialobue - to draw and hold your attention.What of Charlie Wilson's apparently huge tho covert aid to the Afghanis? Like the road to hell, paved with good intentions, perhaps there's a reason that the US government is hurt by the good intentions motivated by Jimmy Carter (or Charlie Wilson) foreign policy mavericks. Their ""better way"" sometimes backfires into the law of unintended consequences.Who knows how many of Charlie Wilson's weapons for Afghanistan now shoot down US aircraft and US soldiers???

The scenes with Mr. Hoffman simply take control of your guts, in a good way though.A dubious film as far as politics. We have Tom Hanks as congressman Charlie Wilson (perhaps the volleyball from Castaway is sort of a real life inspiration for Hanks since he is the producer on this one!) who is a human-tutorial of ""how to become a good politician"". He defines a real man's good taste (in a Conservator's point of view, instead of Liberal): he has intelligent-beautiful women as secretaries, drinks good Scotch, and doesn't beat around the bush when politics is the game. In sum, Hanks reminds us of the parallels concerning personal image and professional life, but with an updated language, the disclosures of backstage ""know how"".The duality of the film lies in how real life facts are constantly left undone. It is a political lesson that shows a group of influential people from Texas in the middle of cold war in the 80's, the Russia x Afghanistan 7 years war. The idea is to bring today's Iraq situation in as comparison with totalitarianism x democracy. Hanks keeps reminding us how good is to be free to choose and express religious beliefs and moral behaviors (I mean, you can do whatever you like in the West, hence Wilson's meeting with Afghanistan President as he's offered something to drink). Meanwhile, Hoffman's character tries to tell us (and Wilson) the little story about the Zen master... well... the movie goes on...In the end, after 1 billion dollars of guns and deaths, Afghanistan is free from the Russians. Only then we get to hear Hoffman's story about the Zen master, which simply explains to us the real issues after the war: how to rebuilt the country. OK, so... let me see if I get that... hum... after years of death and bombings and destruction, what would be necessary to rebuilt the ruins (physical and psychological)? As if strategical men of power could not perceive, only Mr. Avrakotos could! Well... this movie doesn't work, politically speaking! Just as any excuse for war doesn't as well!

Muffled within in this very intelligent, highly involved story of recent history, war and international politics is amusing tongue and cheek humor.The international politics and covert operations encompass many different nations as we see Charlie Wilson pay visits to Israel, Egypt, and Pakistan planning to utilize these nations covertly against the Soviets. His motivations stem from the desire to kill Russians (cold war mentality), his poignant journey to Afghani refugee camps in Pakistan, his integrity despite what we see him doing earlier in the movie, and the benefits Julia Robert's character bestows on him (which is understandable after seeing her gratuitously shot disrobing showing her bikini) The movie believably portrays, and perhaps not to our ease of mind, how things get done in Congress. We are taken into their lifestyle, well..at least Charlie Wilson's.Also interesting is the recent history of the war of the Afghanis fighting the Soviets in the 80s, which has not exactly been overplayed in film.If all this history and political intrigue is not interesting enough, supplementing the entertainment is the humor and of course seeing Tom Hanks (whose performance was great) back in a somewhat comedic role partying with beautiful girls, being a chauvinistic womanizer, boozing, doing drugs etc.The dialogue contained a lot and was detailed however the problem was that it was unnaturally wordy. It becomes hard to swallow and a little unrealistic hearing all the carefully thought out verbiage shooting out at us at such a rapid speed .The movie shows how Charlie Wilson's actions, seemingly glorious at the time, may not be what it was all cracked up to be as when the Soviets leave, Afghanistan becomes confused with Pakistan within the mind of our government, is therefore no longer cared about and we know who takes over next. An interesting question is posed at the end of the movie and the history of what happened becomes so relevant to our own times.",Charlie Wilson's War

162,rlnutt,Enjoyable and interesting... a rare combo for Hollywood to accomplish!,8,24 December 2007,"Being a Texan, I should have heard of Charlie Wilson, but I must admit... never had before this movie. My wife, who grew up in Houston, knew who Julia Roberts character was though... she remembered her as Joanne King (obviously pre 'Herring' days) because she had a interview type local television show on a local station back in the late 70's.I know that Hollywood takes shortcuts when telling a story and this movie was no exceptions. The History Channel ran a documentary on Charlie Wilson that makes Tom Hanks portrayal look like a boyscout selling candles at Christmas. Charlie Wilson was a real scoundrel and a force of nature all rolled into one! After watching the movie and documentary, I've come to the conclusion that Charlie Wilson is a hero and no other individual could accomplish what he was willing to try and do back in the 80's. I was reminded of a line from 'Pappy' Boyington, the WWII flying ace that the late 70's television show was based, when he wrote in his book, ""... you can show me any hero from any war and I'll prove that he was a bum!"" You see, Pappy Boyington was a hard drinking, womanizing, authority hating rascal and Charlie Wilson was cut from the same cloth!",Charlie Wilson's War
163,javaman-7,Movies about actual events and real-life characters are often boring. Not this movie.,9,25 April 2008,"Java Man Reviews ""Charlie Wilson's War"" (Rated R). Directed by Mike Nichols. Written by Aaron Sorkin, based on the book by George Crile. Starring Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Ned Beatty, John Slattery, Denis O'Hare & Om Puri. Running Time: 97 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: Early in the film, we find Texas playboy congressman Charlie Wilson (Hanks) in a Las Vegas hot tub discussing movie deals with a sleazy producer, a Playboy model and two strippers. Out of the corner of his eye he sees a TV news segment featuring Dan Rather, dressed in Muslim garb, filing a report on the recent Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Soon Wilson is deeply involved in clandestine activities that will eventually lead to the Russian withdrawal and the end of the Cold War. His first encounter is with maverick spook Gust Avrakotos (Hoffman); when Wilson asks him who is making Afghan policy Avrakotos answers, ""Me and three other guys."" In order to accomplish the top secret goal of defeating the Soviets, complex deals must be made between such sworn enemies as Pakistan, Israel and Egypt. This calls for complicated and innovative negotiations, involving secret budgets, back-channel meetings and lots of arm twisting. So Wilson seeks the help of a third ally in his quixotic war game, Joanne Herring (Roberts), a conservative Houston socialite who has worldwide connections. She arranges a secret meeting between Wilson and President Zia (Puri), the military ruler of Pakistan. The story rolls along briskly with Texas belly dancers, ""Charlie's Angels"" and a young Rudy Giuliani having key roles to play.REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java Mugs Movies that closely follow actual events and real-life characters often come off as tedious. Not this movie. Writer Sorkin and director Nichols have made a fast-moving, vibrant film that features fascinating characters played by top-notch, Oscar-winning actors. Hanks and Hoffman are rock-solid in all of their scenes, while Roberts inhabits her bizarre southern belle as though she is impersonating a Julia Roberts drag impersonator.Like all of the best directors, Nichols gets great performances not only from his major players, but from everyone who appears on screen. Especially noteworthy are: Puri as the fearsome Pakistani strongman; Adams as Wilson's idealistic, competent assistant; and ""Charlie's Angels,"" the good-looking, sexy-smart staffers who keep Wilson's press core enemies at bay.With Morocco standing in for Pakistan, brilliant location selection and superb cinematography add to the lively feel of the film. In one notable sequence, the camera is placed in the back of a jeep as Wilson is being taken to an Afghan refugee camp. As we bump along behind the driver, we see a hoard of hungry refugees streaming past the jeep and toward a food truck which we know will soon be empty. Later, in a shot that echoes one from Gone with the Wind, a slow pull-out reveals an unending landscape of human anguish, with suffering refugees as far as the eye can see.Though many of the Afghans we helped in the 1980s later turned those guns on us, the filmmakers do not dwell on this gloomy irony. Instead let's leave it with this lesser ironic nugget: Charlie Wilson had many girlfriends over the years. One of them, according to Crile's book, was Diane Sawyer, who is now married to director Nichols.",Charlie Wilson's War

Hanks was pure class, as always, natural and captivating. His duo with Hoffman was pure cinema magic, their conversation towards the end had some great lines. Roberts did not have a big role, but was smooth and made a good fit.Overall, I found this movie entertaining, extremely witty, surprisingly funny...while leaving a good message at the end.",Charlie Wilson's War

He might not have recalled the encounter, 'cause I just sat there trying to gather it all in over coffee with his equally over-the-top PR guy. George had been Down In It. George was Washington Editor of Harper's Magazine. In addition to Harper's, his articles were published in The Washington Monthly, New Times (a short-lived, national truth teller 30 years ago), The Washington Post, and The New York Times. He got in a lot of hot water in the '70s for producing a CBS documentary on the CIA's secret wars from the '50s to that time. George spent a lot of time with Charlie. George wrote the book the film was based on.Just as ""Lawrence..."" (if carefully attended) explains the historical underpinnings of what we've been watching on CNN for the past decade, so does this (if watched carefully). The cultural ""normalizers"" have (expectedly) lined up to take cheap shots at ""CWW."" And the =normalized= will believe what they're told to. But the cat's so far out of the bag now on the far right, big natural resources and the CIA (read Peter Dale Scott, Alfred McCoy, Warren Hinckle, et al) that Nichols can make movies like this and sleep comfortably... even if he still has to do them ""over the top"" like his own ""Catch-22.""",Charlie Wilson's War

So what if Mike Nichols and the book writer and scripter played fast and loose with the facts...as in Liberty Valance: ""This is the west, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" So those put off by Hollywood's version of rather recent events, relax: Commodus didn't fight Maximus in the Coliseum, and Jack Aubrey didn't really fight at Trafalgar. It's a movie, a rather good movie, a jaunty telling of an improbable congressman, the kind of CIA spook I hope we have more of, various naked women, a billionaire former Miss Cotton Bowl, and one of the most fascinating semi historical series of events in recent Russian/Afghan/US histories. Filled with incident, break necked trips from the battlefields of high politics to the savage Northern Frontier of The Man Who Would Be King fame, to esoterica of weaponry...well I'm breathless just trying to type about it all. The plot: how we kicked Commie tail and set the stage for 9/11...in an hour and a half. No Reagan, no Bill Casey, just Charley and Joanne and Gust and a spunky Congressional assistant. A grinning examination of how sausage is made...oops excuse me...how budgets get passed and how Congress works.Recommended highly, leave any knowledge of books such as 'The Looming Tower' behind, wonder at the name dropping (many current politicos must be a bit put off by the trenchant asides about their actions during the period), and a downer of an ending that leaves a historical and real unpleasant taste in one's mouth as the US of A wrote yet another check which when cashed was not honored.",Charlie Wilson's War
167,archer191273,Sadly an eye opener.,9,26 January 2018,"Sadly this is an educational and extremely entertaining movie. Some people say that it is propaganda and that it bias to the Americans war effort in Afghanistan. Obviously they didn't have the brains to watch this movie all the way through. It shows how the USA clearly shot itself in the foot by arming the mujahideen and testing it's weapons against the Soviet army only to leave them cold in a war torn country with no education and a future the would see them attack the USA in the most terrifying fashion in modern history.
 The Soviet army invades Afghanistan in order to bring in a communist state and is engaged in a war with the mujahideen displacing many of the citizens of this country making them refugees.
 Charlie Wilson, a US senator is bought to the attention of this situation and decides that he must convince the US government to help dislodge the Soviets through arming the insurgents. Of course the US government is more than happy to try an array of its weapons without creating an international incident.
 This is an very well made and educational movie that made me sad for the Afghans and quite angry at the US government for the lack of care following this war but i sympathise with Charlie Wilson who had a full heart during and after the conflict but was powerless to help Afghanistan recover. A must see for the younger generation especially. I fpund it a very entertaining piece of cinema.

168,stuprince,A Great Film about how Politics Really Works,9,27 December 2007,"Although this is not a perfect film, it is a wonderful overview of the Soviet Union's ""Vietnam"" and how we essentially spent them to death. It also offers, at the end, some idea of why we are in the current situation in Iraq. Tom Hanks does an impressive job with the Wilson character and, having seen several documentaries on, and interviews of, the former Congressman, Hanks seem to get him dead on as a smart ass womanizing boozer who comes from the only district that does not want anything which gives him a free hand to do what he wants with his vote.This movie shows how much is done in DC behind the scenes and how the committee system can control so much, it also comments that people with limited personal morals can still do good things, an odd concept for many people who see people as either all good or all bad, most of us are somewhere in between.For the purpose of a good movie, this film does feel a bit choppy at times because they are trying to tell a seven year story in the context of a 97 minute film, so knowing the story and suspending the time element helps.I recommend this film, it was very good.",Charlie Wilson's War
169,he_who_leads,Where's the Beef?,5,6 July 2008,"Charlie Wilson. A drinking, womanising, liberal Texas congressman, who was the driving force behind funnelling money to Afghanistan rebels to fight the Sovients.Writer Aaron Sorkin. The man who wrote 'A Few Good Men' and was the main creative force behind 'The West Wing.' An extremely talented guy, who can really hit you for six dramatically and emotionally (many season 1 and 2 'West Wing' episodes). On a good day. Other times he can write poorly (many mediocre season 3 and awful season 4 episodes - that's right - the show went downhill way before he was forced out!! Let's set the record straight!!!).This movie didn't engage my interest enough. It's main mistake is too much information and not enough reflection or specificity on what it all means. The amount of money spent in Afghanistan keeps rising and the weapons keep on getting larger and more sophisticated, but all our main characters don't seem to have much at stake personally except their time and the desire to win. Other real life heroes portrayed in movies have to risk life and limb to achieve what they want. Their wife leaves them, they're alienated by their friends/colleagues, the powers that be try and take them down etc. But the forces of darkness aren't really compelling here. An example is the way Charlie Wilson gets the money from congress to funnel into Afghanistan. Despite some people questioning the soaring amount, at the end of the day, he's always going to get whatever he requests without too much inconvenience. The same with the drinking and womanising angle. Unlike 'Primary Colours' (also directed by Mike Nicholls) It's not good for much except for some humour and a little political inconvenience.The movie is not the total train wreck that I seem to be describing. The main characters are all well played by Tom Hanks, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julia Roberts (not seen enough and surprisingly convincing as a filthy rich politically concerned Texan). And there are Sorkin's trademark amusing/dramatic sparkling dialogue and character exchanges. But the movie doesn't really provide the punch to the gut that I was looking for until the last five minutes, where Wilson has to truly sit back and take stock of what has happened and its implications for the future. Somewhat too little too late.PS This review is not meant to be in any way disrespectful to the real life Charlie Wilson and what he achieved. My review is simply concerned with the big screen translation of his story.",Charlie Wilson's War

The filmmakers of course neglect to tell us the back-story--why were the Soviets in Afghanistan?--but that omission pales in comparison to their failure to reveal that support for Islamicist extremists in Afghanistan in the name of rabid anti-communism ultimately strengthened the hand of anti-western forces and was a big contributing factor to the mess that we find ourselves in today (9/11, terrorist networks, a prolonged ground war in Afghanistan, etc.).

I must however applaud the makeup crew for their work on the dapper Tom Hanks, a coke snorting congressman from Lufkin, Texas; a stunning Julia Roberts as the big-haired Houston political activist; and, Philip Seymour Hoffman, the sleazy CIA operative.

The remaining 3% only mentions the terrible, terrible decisions the US and the Middle East countries did post aftermath. This is the part that most do not comprehend because they severely lack the knowledge to fully understand the implications this had on everyone, and I mean everyone even today.If you're one of the later watchers that doesn't know their history then you can't appreciate the movie in its entirety nor the subtle cries it makes. I would highly to either read up on the wars before watching it or doing that afterwards and watch it again.I make the above comment because although Charlie did do a great thing to end the invasions the US decisions afterwards essentially created what we have today.

I worried about Mr. Hanks return to ""light comedy"" as this is the arena where he made the transition from TV to film- remember ""Big""? Well, ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is not light comedy. It is political satire, and extremely well-written political satire at that. The script is the star of this film, and the word-smithing by Aaron Sorkin is some of the best on offer this year.Mike Nicols holds the entire escapade together, delivering a film that zips along in a very quick 90 minutes (timing is everything in comedy, and nothing is ever funny if it drags). Nicols' choice in sets and lighting are also very reminiscent of '70's and '80's TV, a move used deliberately to root the piece in period.The return to the use of model work and stock photography over digital special effects also enhances the retro look and believability. Note to the production designers in your choice of stock footage: I know the difference between an F-16 and a MiG, and a Bell and a Hind. But that may have been part of the joke, too.I saw this film in Philadelphia. It was interesting to watch and listen to the audience NOT get the historical references to their own history. History tends to repeat because the recidivists have forgotten what happened the first time around.Kudos to both Mr. Hanks and that chameleon Phillip Seymore Hoffman.

So as Julia Roberts. The characters are perfectly set. There is humor in this movie and there is also that thing called reality. The political reality is never filmed as that much brilliance for years. Of course from a Hollywood perspective. But as it is just a time the movie also mentions Pakistan and the president of Pakistan which is also fascinating when we consider what is going on now in Pakistan.

However, in reading these reviews, I found that there are also a good number that portray the film as being the exact opposite of what it is. This seems more than merely not helpful, but outright unhelpful.Perhaps it would be useful to clarify that this is not a movie for people who need dots connected for them. It is a movie that lays the dots out for you and leaves it to you to connect them. If you can do that, you will easily understand that this movie has no illusions regarding the ultimate results of Charlie's efforts, and it is most definitely not a movie about America saving the world again.It is also useful to remember that ""connect the dots"" is a reference to cheesy ""art"" projects designed for those who have no artistic ability.

Apart from one or two very minor factual problems with the script, the only thing that lets this movie down, is the technical direction, there are far too many bad cuts (fudged continuity)and a number of camera ""cheats"" that simply do not work.

179,cineastFGD,Mixed feelings,5,12 March 2015,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie. To start with something positive, the acting is superb, Hanks, Roberts, and Seymour Hoffman deliver as one would expect from such three top class actors. The film is entertaining and well composed, so excellent editing too. Also, it is valuable because it shows some part of the Afghan's suffering under a terrible and unjustifiable Soviet invasion which probably many people nowadays don't know much about. That said I have two fundamental problems with this movie. First, the reduction of all female characters to some ass-wagging eye candy and sex toy and the big men who sit around and 'enjoy/consume' them while puffing their big cigars and deciding on world politics. I'm sure that at some point the real Mr. Wilson and his comrades had to deal with a woman who would not chose to primarily express herself through her décolleté.Secondly, as much as one sympathises with the Afghans in the movie, it still is a terribly wrong policy to fuel a conflict through more weapons and we have ample evidence that this tactics leads not to peace but to the contrary. The cheering about every dead Soviet soldier is still cheering at the expense of the death of a human being, even if the movie tries to trigger us into believing that Soviets are some sort of 'Untermensch', that do not really deserve to live. This utterly stupid black and white painting of Hollywood war movies, with the subliminal tone of the most pathetic sort of (macho) patriotism and the twisting of every historical event into a story that compliments US politics, is sickening. The film absolutely fails to fulfill it's purpose, namely to retell and reflect on a historic event. It stops where it should start, if the makers really wanted to contribute to a better understanding of this historic event. Given the further development of this story, they really missed out on a great opportunity to create a truly great movie. As it is, the movie is just another fairytale combat story that lets the US shine in the most glorious of humanitarian light. Yes oh yes, after all we are the good guys.... By the way, if one wants to see a truly great movie about Afghanistan then 'The Kite Runner' would be an excellent experience.",Charlie Wilson's War

I hated this film - mostly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film glorified war and military technology - blowing things up real good. We are led to cheer as the music swells and the Afghans use our weapons to blow the Ruskies to bits. And no U.S. soldiers put their lives on the line - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, there isn't a touch of real human emotion in the film, just smug, privileged people being sarcastic, feeling superior, and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences. And speaking of consequences, the film only makes a few small hints at what the arming of the Afghans actually led to. I had read an earlier draft of this script, and it ended on 9/11 - with Charlie Wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong. But that wouldn't leave the audience feeling good.

Uhhhh, not exactly. 1. It was the sudden withdrawal of US support once Russia exited Afghanistan that left the power vacuum that was filled by al-Qaeda. 2.

183,correcamino,High Gloss West Wing,7,30 April 2008,"This is a formulaic, higher gloss version of the West Wing, written by Aaron Sorkin. I give it 7 out of 10 stars, so it is not an outright stinker, and the actors portraying the Pakistanis, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman portraying a worn-out CIA agent save the day with real acting.But as is the case with so many moderately successful American movies, this one moves way too fast. If you listen to the initial scenes between Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts as if it were a play, without watching the screen, you realize their acting at this point is just plain bad. Again, the dialogue is too quick for its own good. Charlie Wilson is a Texan and as such, wouldn't he be a slowish talker? He would certainly have been deliberative in his decision making. There is no other word for Hanks' and Roberts' acting: rushed. Part of this comes from the screenplay which too many American writers take to mean conversational one upmanship. Charlie Wilson was a lustful man. Well, then, why do we not see Tom Hanks touch one boob during this entire movie? How prudish! Nor are there any such scenes between him and Roberts. Big stars cannot show frontal nudity or engage in lewd scenes. Well then if they can't, find some worthy actors who can! It's gotten to the point now that if you see a Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, or so many other big stars in a film, then you know there won't be sex in it. Again, films are about the stars' private lives (which dictate no touching of others) and/or protection of their image/biggest asset.One part I did appreciate about the character of Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) was the scene when she is sweet talking Charlie on the phone while in bed with her husband  it captured the utter tastelessness of some of the Texas Rich.With his little lecture to the crèche man, the liberal producers and writers of the film have constructed the perfect congressman in Charlie Wilson: salty in private life, doing the predicable liberal thing in public life. But, again, to be fair, the film did round out Wilson's mediocrity as a legislator. Still, scenes like the crèche one seem stuck-in, as if to ham- handedly remind us: yes, people, we do have separation of church and state. Ugh.Then Charlie Wilson goes to Pakistan. Aha! Here is some real acting. The actors portraying President Zia and the two intelligence officers are simply delivering classical acting at its finest. Good scene.Julia Roberts has an extremely limited range of expression. Most of the time she is rushing her dialogue with an annoyed expression on her mouth. I'm sure she can do better, but has she?Another thing I noticed: the Russians must have been terrible fighters. And to say the Afghans defeated the Russian army I am not so sure is completely accurate. Wouldn't it be more accurate to say they defeated the Russian airplanes?Finally, the tacked on message at the end that Charlie and right wing CIA agent really had nothing whatsoever to do with September 11th, because they did not want to ignore Afghanistan after the Soviets lost, everyone else did (Reagan and the Congress). Charlie Wilson wanted to spend $1 million to build schools. So there. Double ugh.",Charlie Wilson's War

If Charlie Wilson is improbable, Joanne Herring is surreal, and yet that is exactly what happened. The movie is well written, well directed, well acted and the music score is good. First class Hollywood all around.
The movie has a happy ending with a hindsight foreboding. The real ending is still in progress and it is not good. Too bad Charlie Wilson didn't read about Lawrence of Arabia, or he would have realized how difficult it is to win the Peace in Muslim countries. We never learn.",Charlie Wilson's War
186,justbusinessthebook,Another good round of propaganda,5,25 August 2015,"Oh, an interesting watch, entertaining, yes. But disturbing in its one-sided portrayal that what Charlie Wilson and the rich of America did to undermine 'Russian atrocities', committed from high-flying helicopters, was good. OR was their complete, dope complacency inside America during this period of time that, when the Yank did this using drones from on high after 2001, 'someone else!' had better not dare to play Wilson's game in the support of radicals, like ISIS?Oh, maybe the movie is 'honest' (? according to quick research I did, it is not exactly true to history) to only 'some details', but it is at least a must watch to spur the debate as to why, nearing a decade later, we allow lies from all sides to define what 'good democracy' is.... while the rich continue to play their self-serving, high-paying influence games... not really caring about what happened to cause the Russians to enter the destitute nation of Afghanistan in the first place... that part of the story is vainly glossed over.Where was 'peace advocate' Jane Fonda when all of this was going on? Exercising her love handles away for the sake of 'that rich guy' who eventually dumped her anyway?",Charlie Wilson's War
187,hugues-talbot,Enjoyed it but lots of retconed elements,7,1 September 2019,"This film is enjoyable thanks to the unusual performances by Hanks, Roberts and Hoffman. All the characters are deeply flawed, which I find interesting: Hanks plays Charlie Wilson, a real US Congressman who had a lot to do with upgrading the military hardware of the Afghanistan Mujahideen during the USSR/Afghanistan war in the 1980s. He is a terrible womanizer (his behavior would now be unacceptable in the era of the #metoo movement) and an alcoholic, yet in the movie he sees much good in helping the Afghani defend their country. He is motivated along in this endeavor by Roberts' character, who is a great-looking, sex kitten / Christian fanatic who sees God's work in helping Muslim destroy Communist USSR. The know-how is provided by Hoffman, who plays a ruthless CIA covert operator with a lot of experience with the Cold-War international playbook.The movie is very entertaining and does highlight the bizarre, totally undemocratic, donators-driven world of politics in Washington DC. The non-PC atmosphere is fun. Hanks as the main character manages to convey a kind of non-feminist but somewhat women-friendly old school politician. His highly effective team of ""Charlie's Angel"" is fun to watch yet strangely not disrespectful, probably thanks to Roberts' performance as a no-nonsense super-rich unofficial lobbyist for the far right.Historically, the film is inaccurate and biased, yet the ending is basically correct and that is what matters most. All this nonsense for a huge wasted opportunity.",Charlie Wilson's War

189,reddpill,"A fine film, but with some historical compromises",7,7 September 2008,"Charlie Wilson's War, based on a true story, tells the tale of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to secure funding for covert support of the Mujaheddin in 1980s Afghanistan following the USSR invasion of the country. This conflict played a major role in the final years of the Cold War between the US and the USSR.In terms of film making, Charlie Wilson's War is a definite winner. It well-written, well-acted, and well-shot. While most of the attention has gone to Tom Hanks for yet another fine performance, I was even more impressed with Philip Seymour Hoffman's turn as CIA operative Gust Avrakotos. Scenes of Soviet attacks on under-armed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart. The film also gives a good behind-the-scenes look at the wheeling and dealing that Congressman Wilson must go through to secure the desired funding.There are, however, two complaints I have about the film. The first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not well-developed and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line. The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war. The film makes the Mujaheddin look like innocent victims, and while they did suffer large civilian casualties, the Mujaheddin were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of Afghanistan. This government, ignored entirely in the film, not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion, later calling on the Soviet Union for support in their effort. The film also ignores that the US was aiding the Mujaheddin prior to the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan. The film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions -- consequences we are still feeling today -- but it seems as if screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative. (Not having read the book, I do not know if George Crile made the same compromise.) Those complaints notwithstanding, I did enjoy watching Charlie Wilson's War and do recommend it. I would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation, as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana, but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of Charlie Wilson's War than with the ambiguities present in Syriana.",Charlie Wilson's War
190,joeydean61869,An enjoyable melding of tribulation and sitcom,7,31 December 2007,"*** out of **** starsTexas Congressman Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a man of debauchery, but his fast-paced intelligence and charm, along with a few disclaimers, make him extremely likable. He's a womanizer, but not married. He's a 'round-the-clock drinker, but highly functional. He's eyeball deep within several terms (I forget how many) of government bureaucracy, but not corrupt. Deep in his heart, Wilson believes in the American dream, and the nation's ability to make a difference. With the instrumental assistance of Texas millionaire and socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), and individualistic CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Wilson lobbies to increase federal spending for defenseless Afghani refugees (women and children included) who are under attack by Soviet airships on the Pakistan border. His motivation is magnanimous, and no one had any qualms about sticking-it to the Ruskies in the 1980s. Charlie Wilson's War is not a Mike Nichols' masterpiece, but it deserves a special accolade for being admissible and convincing by amalgamating austere subject matter with superior situation-comedy. The acting is top-notch, and the dialogue moves like a freight train running off the tracks. With every conversation (if we listen up, that is) there are gold nuggets to be found, giving us insight into the legislative and covert decision making process. Hoffman is especially enjoyable to experience. Hanks, albeit excellent, always manages to show a little bit of himself in his character by design, whereas Hoffman's chameleon-like talents are astounding. He disappears into Avrakotos. When we laugh out-loud watching this movie, Hoffman is usually on the screen. Julia's part of Joanne, stone-faced yet agreeably imperious, seemingly didn't get as much screen time as I anticipated, not that I was discouraged. She is a regal, unflinching and libidinous woman that we've seen many times before, and Nichols was smart to use her only with purpose. Not to be dismissed are the busty yet intelligent women that make up Wilson's office staff, lead by bright-eyed Amy Adams (Catch Me If You Can, Enchanted). They are willing to jump off a high bridge for Wilson, and ostensibly circumvent Joanne Herring's preeminence by being great fun to watch. The director should be commended for creating scenes in the background that look just as intriguing as a given scene in the foreground, especially through the corridors of Washington. The camera, let's say, may be focused on Hanks and Adams, yet if Nichols decided to closely shoot those around them, we get the impression that the conversation would be just as important. Films often fail at this, making stand-ins seem superficial.It seems every new film about a bygone middle-eastern crisis casts a contemplative shadow on post 9/11 American society. Charlie Wilson's War is no different. We can't help but think that the Afghani freedom fighters would later become the Taliban, and that their country is a disaster again. In the 1980s, the United States, with help from Israel, spent a billion dollars on the resistance against the Soviets. It was evidently successful, but this movie's message is that we didn't finish up, we didn't follow through, we didn't rebuild. Very obvious, with the state of affairs today. It was impressive to learn of this story through such an interesting and precarious medium: comedy and tragedy combined. A risk that worked indeed! Of course, a cast of talented A-list actors doesn't hurt much either.",Charlie Wilson's War
191,ennyman,Insightful Film and Superb Adaptation in an Otherwise Weak Year in Film,9,31 December 2007,"As far as I'm concerned, it was a pretty weak year for films. What I mean is that beginning with spring there were almost no compelling movies playing at the theaters till the very end of 2007. Pirates III with Johnny Depp got a nod from critics and fans as better than Pirates II, but it wasn't enough to make me want to give up an evening or afternoon. I have plenty else on my plate, thank you. I took a chance this fall on Across the Universe, which was entertaining. This year I did most of my movie watching at home.On the other hand, I have read or listened to a lot of very good books this year. One way to get more reading time squeezed in to your life is to listen to books while you commute. Any good library will offer plenty of books on CD or tape for those so inclined. This has been a habit of mine for perhaps eight years now, listening to audio books and lectures.To my surprise, two books that I found especially engaging in 2007 were made into movies that have been released here in mid-to-late December. The first, No Country for Old Men, by Carson McCormac; the second, Charlie Wilson's War, by George Crile. The full title of this latter book is, Charlie Wilson's War: The Extraordinary Story of How the Wildest Man in Congress and a Rogue CIA Agent Changed the History of Our Times.Crile's book is a remarkable read. Purportedly the true story of how Congressman Charlie Wilson led the charge to fund the Afghan resistance, the book is both entertaining and disturbing. Well researched and detailed, it does not drag. The scary part for me, however, is that it proves what I have always said about our federal government: It is too big and out of control.For this reason alone it is an important book, and so is the film that was derived from it. It shows how Washington works.... or doesn't. Or does in spite of itself in some ways.Like many stories interpreting history, it may be a little overboard in crediting Wilson with ending the cold war (almost single-handedly). But the proposition is intriguing and has at least some partial merit. What he accomplished was no less than astounding.So when to my surprise I saw a trailer for Charlie Wilson's War coming to theaters, I was really looking forward to it, and hoping they did not botch the story. Just so you know, the film was a superb adaptation. Tom Hanks was good, of course, and Julia Roberts played her role well, but the screen play is what made it all work. It would have been so easy to have gotten lost in the details and to have made a lengthy, wearisome but ""important"" film. Instead it was a tight story with solid performances throughout. Kudos to director Mike Nichols (The Graduate, Catch-22) and a big round of applause for the incomparable Philip Seymour Hoffman whose range of characterizations is astonishing. The contrast between Capote and Gust Avrokotos is remarkable.The film had any number of places where it could have become derailed. Instead, Nichols maintained the discipline necessary to make this a highly entertaining and thought provoking experience.",Charlie Wilson's War
192,michaelgs,Mostly great fun,9,31 December 2007,"This is one of those movies that grows on you after seeing it. Some people have cast this as political satire, but it's difficult to see who's getting skewered, besides Congress in general. Essentially this is the West Wing with laughs thrown in, and as such it works. The closest thing to a ""message"" is last line of the movie, and while basically the story of every war we've fought over the last century, could almost go either way in terms of the war America is currently engaged in. As such, no matter which side of the political spectrum you are on (except the Social Conservative side, as this movie glorifies fornication and drunken revelry).Hoffman's having a big year, and I liked him far more in this movie than in his less believable and much less likable role in ""Devil."" This movie is actually pretty short but never feels rushed, and one movie you don't want to miss if you would prefer to sprinkle some lightheartedness into your politics over the biting satires and earnest melodramas that have dominated political movies of recent years.",Charlie Wilson's War
193,notevenwordshere,"Move along, nothing to see here, move along...",5,2 August 2008,"It's hard not to be placated by ineffable misery in the myriad manifestations of sludge-like sanctimony that forever flows from those leading the tinseltown rebellion. But while most can't raise their heads out of the slag and slush and perhaps stop yodeling about what a drag everything is, others must emerge with a fistful of the most ostentatious badinage ever penned and slather onto the screen a saliva bender, a hocking spittle-cannon hoisted up on high into a harsh critical staredown. From there snake eyes are king.Philip Seymour Hoffman, doing his best to look once again like Lester Bangs, tells Tom Hanks's titular character about the story of the Zen master and the little boy. Hoffman, so recondite and splayed out, is a Yogi Berra, not recognizing epiphany 'cause he thinks he created it. The story of the Zen master isn't to suggest that people celebrate and/or throw in the towels too soon; that interpretation is arcadian and self-serving. The Zen master is saying in his prescient way, more abstrusely than a Newtonian physicist would, that every action has a reaction, whether or not one has the foresight to be cognizant of it.The film, Charlie Wilson's War, is an interesting one. It marches politic back-dealing as elutriated pragmatism, focused a priori through an ad hominem mindset of self-comforting muses. Diffidence and the courtesy of minding one's own business is a foregone unnecessity. If Wilson's behavior wasn't so rooted in ignorant epicaricacy, his pusillanimous approach to confrontation would be forgivable; for then, at least, he would've known what he was doing, and I can't begrudge that.On the whole, and in the summary of the parts, the film Charlie Wilson's War is a bit predictable, like so many of Aaron Sorkin's screenplays. Nichols effects some strong performances, particularly from Hoffman, but overall his direction is stagnated and impotent, a mash-up of over-lighting and ill-advised design mishaps. Nothing particularly stands out, the showboating least of all. If the cast and crew wants to live by the whims of their double whammys and entendres, then they should do action films. Leave irreverence to the punks -- they do it better.But if you're wondering why I haven't given this movie a terrible rating, then it must be because I kind of enjoyed it. Gee golly, I kind of did. It is an amelioration over all the other attempts to explain the story of how the Soviet Union fell, but as an exercise in cautionary wish fulfillment it falls significantly short of the more intricate and tacit complexity of Syriana, which had much more to say about the (im)morality of interventionary effigies who masquerade pedantic subtleties like a street magician, all while we stare back, empty-headed and with eyes more heavily glazed than doughnuts, like a dog that's just been shown a card trick.",Charlie Wilson's War

Based upon a true story tells us how the West throws money and arms at a problem and expect it to go away. Well, it did go away, albeit temporarily. Look who we (the British, amongst others) are now fighting the very same people who the US gave arms, training and money to in the 80s.This film was always going to provoke political thoughts by the people who watch it, but it does portray a very nice story. However, once the main objective is achieved, i.e. ridding the communists from Afghanistan, it is seen how quickly the plight of people is forgotten about.This film was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. It told the story of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent covert operation by the US to some detail and was dramatised well.

Hanks befriends an odious maverick CIA agent and singlehandedly secures the money for the Mujahedin to defeat the Ruskies in Afghanistan, only to feel a bit down in the dumps when the US fail to fund the reconstruction of the country. Based on a true story? Yeah, right! This film is full of holes. Hanks and Roberts in the same film is my worst nightmare but I persevered to my misfortune. To show the Commies indiscriminately murdering civilians and not suggesting the US does likewise is irritatingly lopsided. I'm not defending the Russians - read about what they are doing in Chechnya - if you can find an investigative reporter who hasn't already been assassinated by the state. But warfare breeds brutality and inhumanity, and the Yanks are as guilty as, if not more so, than most.

The given film despite small duration (""pure"" about 90 minutes) has appeared boring, it was quite possible to reduce to 15-20 minutes. The protagonist of a film - the congressman of USA Charles Wilson. It is represented to us the addict, the drunkard, the fan of women including married, surrounded with women of easy virtue. An awful image. Tom Hanks has played this role it is magnificent, and once again having proved that has knowingly received two Oscars. Further we see that for some top to say lies is a commonplace (one of them says lies that his son was at war in Vietnam against Russian). Really the American elite actually such false?! The main heroine - actress Julia Roberts, has played the role very badly. The worst role in this film. The actor playing the ethnic Greek working in special services of the USA who is apparently discriminated in connection with the origin was pleasant. Thus it is the excellent expert. Further we see that the American elite originally wished to offer 5 million dollars, about 1 billion dollars Thus it as a result has spent has refused flatly to spend ALL 1 million dollars, to help Afghanistan to restore the country. Tremendous greed and nonsense. As a result one of heroes of a film says that Russian have in vain contacted Islam. Also it is the truth. Actually in what the main sense of a film. As I have understood that because of the greedy and silly policy of the USA now is compelled to be at war with Afghanistan. Now she repeats an error of Russian and struggles against Islam.

I didn't think it was possible given that he's a very natural, usually graceful actor, but he was entirely unconvincing as Charlie Wilson. Even Julia Roberts was better in her miscast role as a wealthy Texas dowager. Incredible.As for Aaron Sorkin's screenplay - a bunch of facile quips do not make for a profound exploration of the initial US involvement in Afghanistan.

200,nv-11,Where in the world was Michael Moore?,9,25 December 2007,"Excellent movie (true story) based upon 1 obscure congressman (Tom Hanks) from eastern Texas that catches a glimpse of Dan Rather doing a human interest story in middle east while partying naked in a hot tub in Las Vegas securing future votes. Seems that the Russians have invaded Afghanistan and the Afghan people are under armed to defend themselves. Could it be that the CIA was asleep at the wheel as we find out 20 years later this happens again? Charlie Wilson, with the help of a wealthy socialite from Houston (Julia Roberts), subversively gets the arms/weapons needed to the Afghans for their defense using his connections in the Middle East that normally would not have even been in the same room with each other. Pakistan accepting weapons from Isreal? a little known fact until now. What amazed me is that Charlie Wilson always with a drink in hand and his bimbo looking harem of his office staff (jail-bait as he refers to them) was alert enough to spear-head this covert operation. One can only wonder what kind of a congressman he would have been not under the influence? Philip Seymour Hoffman was superb as the CIA person assigned to this project. His wit was full of sarcasm not totally appreciated by Charlie Wilson. Amy Adams, his office assistant, was perfectly cast, keeping everything in motion in a focused direction. The result of this story leads us to where we are today in Afghanistan. This movie was entertaining, humorous yet serious. So to answer the question Where in the world was Michael Moore? he was making his unbiased documentary at the Hormel meat packing plant in Wisconsin, far from the reality of how the middle east conflict was shaping up to affect us 20+ years later.",Charlie Wilson's War

The truth is, as many awards as Tom Hanks wins, or Julia Roberts wins (and nothing against them, they're tremendous actors), they are always the same. They can do what they've always done the best of anyone else, and that's what sets them apart. But the ability of Philip Seymour Hoffman to be the bad guy in Mission Impossible 3, then be Truman Capote in Capote (that being one of the best displays of acting ever done), and now be the one that supports Charlie Wilson's War on his shoulders, WOW!!! The story follows somewhat the life of Charlie Wilson, and gives him the praise, if that's what you'd like to call it, that he deserves.

202,Gnosys,Very well made for a sensitive topic,8,30 December 2007,"Based on a novel, based on a true story, edited for movie content, and viola - you have this movie called Charlie Wilson's War. However, this movie was released at a time where most people care less about how Afghan people got anti-aircraft missiles and rocket launchers to kick the Soviets out of their country. All people care about these days is kicking ass and having less sympathy for Afghan and Arab people due to the unfortunate disasters occurred in the last 6+ years. However, I will keep my political commentary off this post.Hanks excels as Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson, a morally gray and womanizing politicians with a soft spot for Afghans suffering at the hands of invading Soviets in the early 1980's. Julia Roberts, in a wonderful and exceptional return, plays a former playmate centerfold who now runs a feminist group while living a millionaire lifestyle in Houston, TX. Along with a CIA outcast in Hoffman, they find backdoor methods of assisting poor Afghans fight back the Soviet Russians. In Hollywood, there's one simple rule: if a current or former country was a baddie once, they'll always be a baddie on-screen. A touching masterpiece based on facts set in the past and shows some light side of politicians is very likely to be an Oscar contender, and that's exactly where I see this piece heading. It already has Golden Globe nominations! Due to the political sensitivity of the movie's subject, I'll jump to the praises in production and acting. This has to be Mike Nichols' best work till date, even though Closer wasn't a bad movie, it was carried mostly by the excellent actors. In Wilson's War, too, the movie was carried superbly by the lead and supporting actors. Besides the Oscar-worthy Hanks, Roberts and always promising Hoffman, Amy Adams acted very well as Hank's administrative secretary, the most dignified and least skimpy out of the rest of his young-woman-dominated workforce. Indian actor Om Puri too excelled as the then Pakistani dictator-president Zia Ul Haq who took over presidency after staging a coup d'etat, which is common in that unfortunate nation. Puri surely deserves more recognition in Hollywood. He already is a successful actor in the UK and one of the most respected in his native India.8.5/10. Countdown to the Oscars. Not for the narrow minded type. Keep an open mind about politics and history, you may just enjoy this masterpiece.",Charlie Wilson's War
203,juliana-944-722809,Congressman Charlie Wilson's Classic History Lesson,9,12 February 2011,"It's fair to say, most Americans have practically forgotten the Afghanistan-Soviet War. It was a one sided invasion during the 1980's, during President Reagan's administration, when heavily armed Soviets were destroying primitive tribal Afghan defenders.Except, in ""Charlie Wilson's War Based on the Outrageous True Story"" we learned the inside story about how the 9 year Afghanistan-Soviet War was eventually brought to an end.We watch the true and often humorously outrageous deal making of 2nd District Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson (1933-2010), played brilliantly by Tom Hanks, while he turned from a womanizing boozer into a diplomat. This movie is a history lesson about how one person, with a terrific sense of timing and a network of wealthy supporters, changed the world.In fact, Congressman Charlie Wilson fended off a drug scandal while, at the same time, obtained US foreign aid money to arm badly defended Afghanistan tribal warriors fighting America's enemy, the Soviets.Wilson's public image with the inquiring press was defended by a team of Congressional staffers led by administrative assistant Bonnie Bach, played by Amy Adams.Wilson surprised his colleagues with political maneuvering that eventually contributed significantly to the 1988 Afghan defeat of the Soviets, during the Cold War. It was humiliating for the Soviets, analogous to the American defeat in the Viet Nam War.Nonetheless, Wilson's political triumph on behalf of the Afghans was not without serious consequences. His support of the Afghan fighters created a new breed of warriors, i.e., the Taliban.Charlie Wilson is well portrayed by Tom Hanks. In my opinion, this role seemed natural for Hanks, as he relished playing the naughty hero. Actress Julia Roberts was exceptional as Joanne Herring, the wealthy right wing Christian zealot who bought and paid for any influence she needed to defeat the evil Soviets. Indeed, it was a little hard to believe that right wing Texas Christians were vested in defeating the Soviets, but this was a true story and Ms. Herring was a major influence in Wilson's efforts.An exceptional performance was given by Philip Seymour Hoffman as the second tier CIA operative named Gust Avrakotos. He was a marginalized CIA operative who began his relationship with Wilson as a facilitator, to smooth the edges with an over reaching Congressman. Soon, however, Avrakotos is swept up in Wilson's risky plan to find enough money to help the Afghans. He supported Wilson within the CIA as US foreign aid money was found and used to buy heat seeking weapons to shoot down Soviet helicopters.In the end, Avrakotos taught Wilson the ultimate lesson ""In Zen"". Although Wilson was celebrated for his efforts to bring down the Soviets, Avrakotos says ""We'll see"", as a warning about the unintended consequences of the victory.Charlie Wilson's War is an excellent story, with historic accuracy that makes it a classic.The convincing portrayals, by all characters, against the background of a real US Congressman's deal making lifestyle, will improve this film over time. It was nominated for many awards but deserved to win more. I'd give this film a 10 star rating but the end seemed too choppy, like the editors were eager to finish it off. Otherwise, I loved the movie.",Charlie Wilson's War

How wrong was I, because that short scene is as close as the film ever gets to boring.The film is full of entertaining & amusing set ups and cracking dialogue in some of the most unexpected places. The next scene after the Awards ceremony is Charlie in a Hot-Tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a TV programme. Another rather amusing scene is about 3 quarters into the film comprises Charlie, a group of his rather sexy Secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffmans CIA Man and a bottle of Whisky. As to dialogue what about this for a line, ""The Senator says, He can teach us to type but can't teach us to grow Tits."". OK, School-boyish I know but the film is laced with great lines.As to performances well Phillip Seymour Hoffman as usual steals every scene he's in. Hanks is OK but surprisingly to me anyway was Julia Roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric Texas Oil Millionairess.Charlie Wilson's War is one of the best non Musician Bio-pics in a long while as well as being that rare thing a film that entertains, amuses as well as informs all in equal measure.",Charlie Wilson's War
205,dada_neso,Huge Waste,1,31 December 2007,"The Soviet war in Afghanistan also known as the Soviet-Afghan War was a nine-year conflict involving Soviet forces supporting the Marxist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) government against the largely Islamic fundamentalist Mujahideen insurgents. The latter group found support from a variety of sources including the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations in the context of the Cold War. The Islamists that fought also believed that they were responsible for the fall of the Soviet Union. Osama bin Laden, for example, was asserting the credit for ""the collapse of the Soviet Union ... goes to God and the mujahidin in Afghanistan ... the US had no mentionable role,"" but ""collapse made the US more haughty and arrogant.""Following the Soviet invasion, the United States supported diplomatic efforts to achieve a Soviet withdrawal. U.S. contributions to the refugee program in Pakistan played a major part in efforts to assist Afghans in need. This cross-border humanitarian assistance program aimed to increase Afghan self-sufficiency and help Afghans resist Soviet attempts to drive civilians out of the rebel-dominated countryside. During the period of Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the U.S. provided about $3 billion in military and economic assistance to Afghans and the resistance movement.""The CIA made a historic mistake in encouraging Islamic groups from all over the world to come to Afghanistan.' The US provided $3 billion for building up these Islamic groups, and it accepted Pakistan's demand that they should decide how this money should be spent",Charlie Wilson's War
206,flechette,"Funny, sad, and ultimately frightening - a film that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world.",9,15 December 2007,"Mike Nichols in finest form. I was not a fan of ""Closer"", so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. Just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but Nichols and his very strong A-list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling Congressman.Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant - here playing a damaged but ultra-smart CIA manipulator, and it is in the exchanges between Hanks and Hoffman's characters where the comedy soars. Rarely is movie humour laugh-out loud and also smart... This hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world (often simultaneously).One other major plus is the length of the picture. The film is based on George Crile's fat book of the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is ""The West Wing"") must have been to make a fat movie, but what we get is a breath-taking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implications.This film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of it's sparkling witty script - even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that Herring and Wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11).",Charlie Wilson's War
207,iami-4,Jolly Cholly's enlightenment (and his well-rounded office staff),5,2 January 2008,"Mike Nichols? I thought he was dead. Right, I was wrong on that point and some will think me wrong in this evaluation. Here goes. Director Nichols takes Jolly Cholly Wilson, well-dressed but still a slob on government payroll, and shows us how and when he finds enlightenment concerning violence and carnage. Pardon me, but during the viewing I got to wondering why he didn't learn that at home or in a Texas high school. Or was his favorite teacher the football coach? (I got nothing against sports -- nothing that a more real combo of student and athlete wouldn't satisfy.) Nichols, maybe, is telling us that snazzy dressers win elections in our system of self-governance. OK. When a man can't even govern himself, he can pretend to be a political leader. Funny? That much is. But this movie's dialog isn't so much, unless we consider the f-word skilled writing. (Jon Stewart, take notice.) The office banter and bodies are oh so cute, dontcha know. Tom Hanks does what's required of the role, and I can't deny his skill at understatement. Aided by wild black hair, Philip Seymour Hoffman portrays constant pique at not being relied upon to direct sanctioned murder. Julia Roberts is in this one so she can appear in the ads. You can tell by now that I didn't have fun on New Year's Eve in the theater. Probably I needed a good documentary on the subject of foreign wars involving U.S. intrigue. Instead I got another fictionalized ""based-on"" flik. Also, could be I was too eager for beer, a semi-raw steak, and good conversation. As for the latter, at dinner we couldn't even dredge up much of that about this story which gets lost in the crowded world of fast edits and (I repeat) cute dialog. Hey, almost forgot to mention the portrayal that strong drink is what fuels Congress and its helpers. Yup, war is Hell. But not much worse than our nation's inability to elect representatives who know something important before they even dare run for office. Thanks for telling us that, Mr. Nichols. But it ain't even very entertaining nowadays. Mike gives us a denouement statement on screen with, once again, that humorous word in it. Why not, I wonder, something in a dozen words or less that would help us to imagine how silly we are looking after rushing into this current extended violence that is sapping our strengths? He did that, you say? Naw. Mr. Nichols settled for cutesy with a pretense of shock.",Charlie Wilson's War

He was absolutely brilliant, and he brought such a witty and sarcastic humor to a film that had everything that a good movie should have. A solid plot, great character performances, and Tom Hanks. Julia Roberts was sub par at best, but her role is limited to the point where she can't drag down the brilliance that Hanks and Hoffman have with their chemistry on screen.

Tom Hanks is finally cool again, and who knew the Julia Roberts still looked so damn good in a bathing suit? The only downfall in the film was it's inconclusiveness. I mean, it does come to a close, yet you still feel like there's something coming, and maybe that was the point, because that's the way you feel it should have been, and this is the way it was.

The subject, I admit I never really looked into prior to watching the film. I like PSH though so I thought I would give it a try.Well I was not disappointed! Its a great film. Its incredibly funny (given the subject matter) Tom Hanks is great and must be considered for the nod this year. His character is amusing, lovable, non pretentious and seems to genuinely care about his ""cause"".PSH is the comic relief here. He is fantastic as the helpful if a little angry CIA agent whom Hanks decides to work with in order to get aid and money into Afgahnistan.Roberts does her usual. She does not have many lines but she is great all the same.The way the writers portray a lot of events is obviously been changed a bit for Hollywood. Overall though there is a story here and it did happen. The US funded the Taleban to defeat the Soviets (who were a far more worrying prospect than any kind of terrorist nowadays).The genius of this film is making it so damn funny. Its great satire. I especially liked the uneasiness from the Pakistani president when Hanks goes to visit him at the start of the film.

For me it was a completely waste of time, I was believing that at the final the story was going to make sense and it was going to like me but no! I hated it, it made me loose my valious time. Until now I think its the worst movie that I have seen in the 2009 year.

We have already seen these moments (power, politics, and war) in other movies in many other forms and mixtures. I can't count how much movies were created.What I much like is that this movie never wanted to show USA as holy liberator and a land which can not stand with cold blood while innocents are suffering by a suppressor. Of course, she can, if her interests say that. This time her interest obviously suggests to do something else. I don't believe that the billion dollar support which was given to Afganistan back to that years was up to one or few men only as the story has told but it was really good to see how Charlie Wilson character got his conviction when gone to a refugee camp. Here I have felt some idealistic line behind, while the movie would never say or suggest directly that Charlie has right and want to bring freedom for Afganistan. I think one of the most important virtue in this movie is its realistic portrayal about a senator who has the power to do what he wants but he did nothing important for a long time. He was just like anybody else: a human with passion and weakness. His love, Joanne also.Tom Hanks was great as always but this time I felt Julia Roberts was a bit greater. Philip Seymour Hoffman was also noticeable in his role.Let me close this comment with Charlie's quotas from the end: ""These things happened. They were glorious and they changed the world...and then we f...ed up the end game."" I think, this is the message which has to be learned in this age for everyone who can spend one billion for a war but can not spend only one million for the stability of the regions he had leave his footsteps...My rate was 8 for the movie.",Charlie Wilson's War
215,mstytz,A waste,1,26 December 2007,"The movie presents a biased, untruthful portrayal of the events and decisions surrounding US support for the Afghan rebels in the 1980s. Its even lousy fiction. Others led the way to support the rebels, Wilson only became involved when it was expedient. This movie is a grave injustice to the people who actually risked much to aid the rebels. The film seems more like a propaganda work intended to convince the viewer that Democrats are strong on national defense policy and that even the most liberal of Democrats will be a strong leader in the war on terror. While Wilson did play a role, it was much smaller than that presented in the film. It is a shame that people will see this movie and think that it presents some version of the truth regarding support for the rebels. The humor was juvenile. The acting could have been better. Even granted literary license to stretch the truth, the movie goes way too far in its distortion of the events and times. I did not enjoy the film.",Charlie Wilson's War

Once over in Pakistan the president asks Charlie to go at least look at the refugee camps (where many displaced Afghan's are forced to live due to the war they are in with the Soviet Union). After he sees the camps, he feels compelled to help the Afghan's anyway he can. Go see the movie if you want to see how it all turns out. You will not be disappointed.

Sometimes to be entertained, sometimes to be educated, and sometimes both.Charlie Wilson's War performs the latter sublimely. The script is, to borrow a phrase from a prior review, ""riotously sarcastic."" The performances are excellent. The editing is tight. Why? Tom Hanks pulls off another believable, enjoyable performance as the brazen and unabashed Texas Congressman. Julia Roberts' performance as the smart sassy and hot Texas socialite is unexceptional but competent. And of course, as he so often these is inlined to do, Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals the show as the blunt, acerbic, but hardworking and highly effective CIA agent. It is also important to mention that, to my knowledge, no no major part of the film was fabricated or exaggerated.The main observation I have to add the critical praise of this film is that I believe it should be viewed as a dramedy. Like Juno (if you haven't seen that one too, it's worth at least a bargain showing), it manages to deftly to portray a serious situation with a lot of humor mixed in, without compromising the severity of the message. It also manages to be stray from any punditry on the Afghanistan situation following their defeat of the Soviets. Basically, it tells it like it is while making it enjoyable and stimulating.

221,RevSykes,"Very , very intelligent quasi-black comedy",8,8 May 2009,"When I saw this film in the theater, I was disappointed. From Mike Nichols, Tom Hanks and Aaron Sorkin, my expectations were sky-high. I thought the film kind of petered out toward the end and underplayed the disaster to come in Afghanistan.I've now seen it a bunch more times on HBO and I like it a lot more. Tom Hanks did a great job, but the movie stealer is Philp Seymour Hoffman as Gust. He's sly and vulgar and frank and those playing off him have great comic opportunities. Hanks and Hoffman almost get a Kirk-Spock thing going as they travel around the world making deals. They win over their Israeli contact who complains about Hoffman, ""I don't like this guy!"". Hanks shakes his head and in a soft Texas drawl says slowly, ""I know exactly what you mean!"". Also, now having noted that Hoffman starts the Zen master story when they first meet (who in the world is supposed to notice that the first time?) and the whole story at the end, I no longer worry that it takes the Afghanistan story out of context.The film will never be a hit for the obvious reason -- it has no emotional core. Sorkin doesn't need screen writing 101 of course, but he chose not to highlight an evolution of character for any of the three lead roles. Hanks goes from a party boy lush to a freedom fighter? Well, somewhat, but, as in reality, the story kind of passes him by and leaves him behind. Hoffman is great, we might not want him to change but moving him to the inside so he can wreak havoc on the CIA from higher up might have worked. Julia Roberts' character isn't much. A bit of fun, but nothing to remember about it.Perhaps this film has the bug of ""true story"" to it, limiting how far the writers were willing to go to add drama. They didn't achieve a whole lot of drama, but they added a lot of intelligence, topicality and black humor. A fun movie.

The end point about us spending billions to free Afghanistan but being unwilling to spend a million to rebuild the schools was a clear hat tip to that.

Tom Hanks' easy and smooth portrayal of partying, good ole boy politician Charlie Wilson is undeniably award material. This drama took what many would probably perceive to be minimally entertaining if not completely inconsequential news and political behind the scenes shenanigans and portrayed them in a unique combination of entertainment and real life slice of previously unknown political activism and intrigue. It does seem thought she gives the role a hardy effort that Julia Roberts is somehow miscast in her role.

231,teocalli,Excellent and faithful adaptation of the best-selling book.,9,22 December 2007,"It doesn't happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference.George Crile's 2003 best seller, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely ""difference maker"" imaginable. A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas, ""Good Time Charlie"" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. Likable and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of Lufkin only really wanted two things, their guns and to be left alone. It's Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as Charlie's Angels.When asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive, young aides his response is a classic, ""You can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits."" No argument there.But even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the Russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the Cold War as a result. Fat chance, huh?Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising ""Charlie's Team.""The on-screen ""Team,"" is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. He's aided, abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still-slinky Julia Roberts. Hey, why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? By all accounts Ms. Roberts looks good and holds her own, but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why Kabul and country is so important to her character. Maybe the two Afghan hounds usually by her side know -- but we as an audience never do. As for the third member of the ""Team,"" Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he appears in as Gust Aurakotos, a smart, street- wise (i.e. non Ivy League graduate) CIA malcontent who knows the score -- both in the Agency's boardroom and in Wilson's bedroom.For the Mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance the U.S. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies. This takes money, lots of money, and eventually ""Charlie's Team"" covertly coerces those in Congress to fund the effort to the tune of $1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty, nasty stuff.That this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind Congressional doors is truly alarming. Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. Oh momma, I wish it weren't so...Even though the initial outcome for ""Team Charlie"" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was entirely ""covert,"" the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of Soviet oppression and the end to Russian barbarity was the direct result of American intervention. Yes, once the Russkies left, so did our aid -- zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it's like the forerunner to ""Mission Accomplished.""As Nichol's film so pointedly points out, ""The ball you've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it."" Mike Krzyzewski knows this, Eva Longoria Parker knows this, little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this, but the typical American politician doesn't. So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys. Talk about a Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols film).Perhaps Charlie Wilson said it best, ""We f&%ked up the end game.""Again.",Charlie Wilson's War
232,crimsonandsilver,Parties Save the World: An American War Story,7,1 August 2013,"Charlie Wilson is hanging in Las Vegas with some hookers in a hot tub when he finds out that Communist USSR is invading Afghanistan. Thus begins a wild and often loony tale of how the US aided Afghanistan in the war against communism.Now, I haven't read the book on which the movie is based. I am speculating that the book is the reason the pacing is a little off in certain parts of the movie. There are several subplots that fight for screen time in this less-than-2-hour movie. There are also some scenes that were meant to show the woman-loving Congressman that is Charlie Wilson that could have been consolidated. (One scene in particular is the scene with Emily Blunt. I like Emily Blunt, but the scene seemed odd and out of place.) The story was interesting, and definitely a unique look at the end of the Cold War. So, a little known Congressman, a CIA agent who's career is going nowhere fast, and a socialite whose hair resembles cotton candy band together to get funds and weapons to the Afghan refugees. They do this through a series of well-placed parties, fund raisers, and apparently, the power of Joanne's hair.Tom Hanks played Charlie Wilson rather well. The Texan accent was a little thick at times, but at least it was recognizable. Perhaps it was my ADD, but Julia Robert's performance was often overshadowed by how flamboyantly her character dressed.

233,fczenit,America saves the world....again.,4,1 January 2008,"When the American movie industry tries to critically look at their own government they make damn sure it looks good even when it's bad.The film does 1 thing right it demonstrates perfectly what is wrong with the American politics. The motto seems to be to f**k with whoever it takes to get things done!!! Mix an American Congressmen, a CIA agent, a Jew and an Arab... just to f**k the Ruskies. Thanks to US for giving us Osama Bin Laden.The disappointment of the film comes in the face of muddling up the issues: using imagery of Afghan children with no arms and the stories of soviet atrocities and then making a blatant attempt to suggest a link between those and the reasoning behind the American help. Every sensible person knows why the $1,000,000,000 was raised... not the dying Afghani children that's for sure.As usual the serious issues are covered into facade of bullshit dialogue. ""Here is to you, you M***r F*****s"" Hoffmam chants at the end, all that's missing is the American flag in the background and the stupid military solutes. The films can not help but leave the aftertaste of the feeling of American pride and glee on how we (the Americans) have saved the world... once again. Not even the last 5 minutes of the film can save it, where an attempt is being made to stop praising yourself and wake up to the fact that its just another American F**k up.The acting and editing was good though.",Charlie Wilson's War

Trust me, I am not a Tom Hanks fan, but I thought he was decent in this and was the right man for the role. For Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he was excellent as usual. Julia Roberts, I must say was not so good. I have never been a fan but she turned in a bland performance that lots of other actresses could have cooked up. Another asset which this movie has is the fact the editing was almost spot on. There was a lack of annoying sappy scenes, but you had a sense that they were there, just not on the screen. The directing was pretty flawless, and the cinematography was creative and rather hilarious at times. This can be considered either a drama or a comedy, and I think that this film got snubbed in terms of being on the Golden Globe ballot for Drama, it is definitely more of a drama than a comedy.",Charlie Wilson's War
236,almostgone-1,A note to those who consider this movie to be satire,8,1 January 2008,"Charlie Wilson's War is an almost perfect movie. There are not five wasted minutes in the film; it's as tight as Julia Roberts' little bum. And consider, if you will, the difficulties of telling this story in 90 tight minutes, and telling it with intelligence and wit - not easy. The flaws have to do with casting Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts, probably in the hope that the film might make some money. And they were GOOD, credible and workmanlike and professional. But the actors' persona were too visible; I might rather have seen good character actors in the parts, though it probably would have doomed the movie to obscurity. And Charlie Wilson's War, by the way, is in no sense satire. The characters and situations portrayed are dead on, and if you don't believe it, you ought to spend a little time among Texas politicians and those who fund them.",Charlie Wilson's War

238,prometheus_prime,Outstanding movie,8,2 January 2013,"Every now and then there comes a time where a movie comes along that hits every mark of a great movie. The director was able to find a balance with the dark subject matter and a witty script. Sometimes it may not seem like it, but periodically a person comes around and makes a big difference. It was fascinating to see such an unlikely person to have made a big enough difference. You have a almost invisible congressman from Texas who was more known for his liberal lifestyle then is libertarian bills. Sometimes a good for nothing has something inside of him that comes out and changes how they are defined as a person. Charlies was the atrocities being committed during the afghan and Russian war. With his political savvy and team he helped deliver a humiliating defeat to the Russian army and possibly helped end the cold war. Tom plays a very solid role definitely one of his best. He also has the help of Julia Roberts who really holds her own. As usual another top actor in Philip Seymour Hoffman really steals the show as a disgruntled CIA agent. One of the most important parts was to try to covertly coerce congress to approve close to a billion dollars worth of advanced weaponry so that the Mujahideen could shoot down Russian helicopter gunships and fight the rest of the Russian army. To see something like this take place on screen is a real eye opener on some things that go on behind closed doors. Sometimes movies with a subject matter as this it can sometimes drag on and get boring. You would be sadly mistaken weather it was the great timing of the movie as a whole or the amusing wise cracks and scenes made this very entertaining and amusing.",Charlie Wilson's War
239,bobsphotography2000,Documentary Just On TV: Two Hours of the REAL Story,5,1 January 2008,"Although I haven't seen the movie yet, I'm not sure I want to after watching the documentary. Tom Hanks always makes a winner movie, but the real story is easily disliked for several reasons.Since I don't know what the actual Hollywood movie shows, I can't put 'spoiler' here but you might not want to read the rest.The Congressman was nominated by some group as one of the most INeffective Congressmen on the Hill at the time although he kept getting reelected. One complaint was that he was flying all over the world (which turned out to be the action of the movie that has been made as he was involved in funneling US Dollars to the anti soviet forces in Afghanistan. He was actually doing something but few people knew exactly what).He was accused of using cocaine along with some bathing beauties within a hot tub party in Las Vegas. In the documentary, he remained mum without denial nor admission. He did confess to being a party hog and having multiple DUI arrests in his life. (So, being as smart as he is, he understood that DUI puts innocent people at risk & he did it anyway). So, if you're the kind who doesn't care what a man does on his off work time, then this might not bother you.What is rankling is that by his own admission, he ""DOUBLED"" the initial dollar amount going to fund anti soviet forces ""on my own authority."" THUS, BY CHANCE OF BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE WITH THE RIGHT AUTHORITY, HE BYPASSED THE American PEOPLE / VOTERS AND BEGAN FUNDING ON A SMALL MANNER HIS OWN PERSONAL AGENDA. HE ADMITTED OTHER CONGRESSMAN SAW WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT SAID ""NOTHING."" His game ended up expanding to a BILLION DOLLARS eventually. Did it help cause the Soviets to withdraw from the war in Afghanistan? No doubt some. But, he did it without voter approval and without the knowledge of most of the US Government. Thats why its called, ""charlies war."" Did it affect the average American in any negative way other than taking our money for a war on the other side of the planet and which was on turf right adjacent to the Soviet Union itself? Yes. In one spy type episode, a weapon was discharged on US soil by mistake prior to an authorized viewing of big shots. The weapon hit a local gas station, burned it to the ground, and put ... yes... innocent people's lives at risk. Nobody was harmed but the US Government had to pay the owner of the station for all the damages.So far, dollars taken without proper scrutiny by people who should have been involved and American lives put at risk.The bottom line is this: Americans ARE TIRED OF OUR LEADERS GETTING US INTO WARS AROUND THE PLANET RATHER THAN TAKING CARE OF America. NOBODY HAS AUTHORIZED THE FEDS TO DO THIS. THEY GET US INTO WAR AFTER WAR WITHOUT GOOD REASON WHILE OUR COUNTRY GOES BROKE AND OUR BORDER IS SO UNENFORCED THAT 4,000 ILLEGALS FLOOD ACROSS DAILY.The reasoning Charlie gave as getting us deeper into that war at the risk of a Soviet Union counterattack? "" We had a moral duty "" said Charlie.The American people were used in a way in which they didn't get a chance to decide themselves if the ""moral duty"" really applied. They had to take Charlie's word for it.As it all turned out, the Soviet Union fell apart 10 months after they withdrew from Afghanistan, but it may well have done that without a single congressman's crusade that could have put the USA into World War III with the Soviets who could have possibly destroyed our entire country.Charlie's War should be viewed as something out of history but be cautious in your emotions. One congressman out of 530 or so total took matters into his own hands. Our government isn't supposed to work that way. Thats called Risky Business.",Charlie Wilson's War

241,Andrea-Orsini-1,Messing around with destiny,8,9 February 2008,"Aaron Sorking raises the same questions as Shakespeare did or does. How could they possibly know so much about the inner workings of palace life. Here like in The West Wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that are hardly a shock but seem ton confirm our worst fears. Everything is so casual and at the same time so directly responsible for so many people's lives. A puffy Tom Hanks tells us one way or another that things can be manipulated with semi pure intentions but without weighing the consequences and Julia Roberts in a blond southern hairdo reminds us of the powers harbored in the sidelines. The subject is serious but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the invisible middle man, steals every scene he is in, just like Charles Laughton did in every movie he was in.The dialogue is fast but not fast enough for us not to catch up and discover that this is not an ordinary comedy. The seemingly casual pace filled with strokes of wit and provocation grants another badge of honor in the Mike Nichol's collection.",Charlie Wilson's War
242,dshipley,a pale shadow of the book,4,18 June 2008,"Your time and brains will be much better spent reading or listening to Charlie Wilson's War. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, plays the most enjoyable character in the movie, Gust, the Greek, and he plays him as a eunuch. Gust, in the book, is hard core and completely free to speak his mind. In the movie, he's not even shown as being equally important to Charlie. And poor Charlie is never shown donating blood (which he did every time he visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the movie is too bland, and the history is too old for our modern time. We don't really care about the end of the cold war and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which happened in spite of Reagan, not as a result of) by a well financed group of people who were extremely willing to fight. Not quite the lesson we need to be hearing and seeing considering how well the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going.

Charlie Wilson's War is a well-made depiction of America's business of waging war around the world. Sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose ... or do we? Perhaps only the Zen Master knows. Speaking of masters, Tom Hanks, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Julia Roberts perform masterfully. There is just enough humor to offer adequate contrast with the reality of what the Afghans were coping with under the terrible attacks by the Russians. An excellent and tightly written script does not preach. Draw your own conclusions. My favorite line was, ""Jail bait!"" Oh, and the number one problem in America? Arrogance.",Charlie Wilson's War
244,codeman1964,How The Democrats Won The War,5,24 December 2007,"Hollywood's revisionist historians never cease to amaze me. This movie tells the story of how the Soviet Union was defeated by the efforts of a single Democratic congressman from Texas. And WHAT a Democratic congressman!! His partying, cocaine use and womanizing are enough to bring a patriotic tear to any leftist eye! Why, he's so deliciously charming (think Bill Clinton) that he even staffs his office exclusively with large-breasted rejects from the Russ Meyer circuit who he affectionately refers to as ""jail-bait"".But enough about the blatant pandering to lefty audiences, my main concern is not with the factual content of the movie, which I'm sure is accurate, but with, as with most left-wing Hollywood (was that redundant?) films, the manipulation, the slant and the parts cunningly left out.Actually, the film deserves kudos for including a single line uttered by one of the Pakistani officials...""it must appear as if the aid is coming from Pakistan""...of course, it's significance was downplayed and it was portrayed as a noble sentiment.In reality, Pakistan's only condition for agreeing to U.S. aid to Afghanistan was absolute silence as to the source of the funds. Islamabad (and the ISID secret police in particular) doled out aid to the Mujahideen on the pretext that Pakistan was the sole source of the funds and weapons. The only caveat to receiving this assistance was a requirement for the Afghans to send all of their school-aged children to an Islamic madrasah for education. The madrasah were staffed solely by imams from, you guessed it, Saudi Arabia. Thus these young people who couldn't speak a word of Arabic learned Wahhibi Islam (the most intolerant sect of an intolerant religion) by rote.And 20+ years later, you have Islamic fundamentalism in Afghanistan...but, never mind, I'm sure it was America's fault for their evil attempt to prevent more mutilated children...not Russia's, not bin Laden's, not the Saudi's and not the ISID...only the U.S. It's simpler that way.",Charlie Wilson's War

But how many times have American films gone ahead and defended their fatherland's atrocities. Here comes another example..America has been imperialistic for more than two centuries while Soviets were totally against. Charlie Wilson's war is another classical example which is a fabricated justification of the American arrogance. These are some facts1. Its CIA who sowed the seeds of Mujaheddin & other Islamist extremist organization which is now a real set back.2. Don't you ever forget the Vietnam war??? American Brutalities!!!3. Unlimited funding to Pakistani military expansion who use it against India rather than fighting terror or feeding their own people.4. Soviet Union and other so called iron curtain countries were totally against imperialist expansion at least according to their manifesto.5.

I found that how Charlie escapes one criminal investigation that could end his career hilarious. His interaction with his all-female staff is very amusing as well.The movie was fast-paced, and had great dialogue. It's a good thing that it seemed too sort, though it glossed over years of warfare, focusing on Charlie's interactions with the CIA agent Gus, Pakistan's Prime Minister Zia and his aides, and the wealthy Joanne, ""sixth richest woman in Texas, which is still pretty good.""If you want to find out more about why Afghanistan is such a mess today, contrast Charlie's his ability to find the right financial, military, and human resources to shoot down the Soviet aircraft razing Afghanistan's population versus the lack of funding for basic infrastructure today.",Charlie Wilson's War

Just leave the political baggage at the door.What you don't already know about this story from the trailers and TV ads you can find in other comments on this site. What you may still be asking yourself is ""Should I go see this pic now at theater prices or wait for the DVD."" If you enjoy great acting and witty dialog supporting a fascinating story then this film is worth a trip to your local megaplex. Hanks is great (as usual) and Philip Seymour Hoffman is amazing. Sorkin's dialog is witty and revealing in ways that are often subtle. His screenplay as directed by Mike Nochols is economical with very little flab. This is a movie that will seem even shorter than its 97 minute running time.If you are a ranting conservative you will probably hate the film because it doesn't give Ronald Reagan credit for winning the Cold War. You might also be put off by Congressman Wilson's lack of family values. If you are knee jerk PC lib, you will probably hate this pic because it ""demeans"" women and glorifies the CIA.

248,lordfinese,Another pack of historical lies,1,11 October 2015,"Brzezinski admitted that the US started the war BEFORE the Soviets invaded and that it was a trap for them. The CIA/ISI was waiting for them even before they invaded. This movie portrays it as if some congressman came there in the 80s and he say suffering and then decided to act, with the usual fake made up grotesque stories of Russian barbarism to justify using Afghans as a pawn in a geo-political war. The same head chopping fanatics they used in Afghanistan are know in Syria, the US has a bad habit of exporting terrorism around the world with its shady Gulf/Turkish allies. Then you have the Stingers, which are useless missiles. The Russians lost less aircraft in Afghanistan than in training back in the USSR, although the Russian counter part, the Igla, has pretty much taken out the entire Ukrainian air force, in yet another country the US has unleashed war on with covert action. Also the lie that Afghanistan war is what ended Communism and the USSR, the KGB was training their high level agents in the 1970s for the fall of the USSR, it was all planned by Globalist forces, Gorbachev was appointed successor of Brezhnev if you can believe it, of course the top job went to a few elder politburo members like Andropov before Gorby got the job. The Central Banking elite planned not only the rise of communism but its fall, what they couldn't predict is a young Nationalistic officer of the KGB who played them at their game, and then turned the tables of those very elite, he is the President of Russia today, and knows the US's dirty wars in Libya, Syria, Egypt, Chechnya, Dagestan, Yugoslavia, China, Ukraine, Georgia, Latin America, and many other nations have killed millions, and in Syria he is drawing a line in the sand and saying enough is enough, and starting to kill the US's latest ""freedom fighters"", and that is ISIS. It is sick the amount of lies and jingoism spread to naive Americans through Hollywood, but alas, just look at who runs it financially. Today Communism lives on, but not in Russia. It lives on in the Trotskyist Neo-Bolshevik Neo-Cons who run US foreign policy. It lives on with the invasion of Europe with terrorist GLADIO B armies called migrants, despite the vast majority being military aged men, most of them not even fleeing from Syria, and the ones that are, many are fleeing from the brave Kurds or Syrian Army, the US has to protect its death squad army at all costs.",Charlie Wilson's War
249,roaringfirefilms,An entertaining movie spoiled by major historical flaw.,5,12 February 2010,"This movie moves along in an entertaining fashion but its fundamental flaw is that it ignores the fact that the CIA induced the Russians into the conflict in the first place and so the entire historical fairytale is destroyed. There is no doubt over this historical fact as it has been confirmed by the likes of Robert Gates the defense secretary and members of Carters administration that oversaw it. When you know that the ""good guys"" were behind inducing the Afghan government for asking the Russian military to help them fight the Islamic extremists (CIA funded that became the Taleban) then it changes everything in the movie to being a rather distasteful propaganda piece.Carter adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski stated ""According to the official version of history, CIA aid to the mujahideen began during 1980, that is to say, after the Soviet army invaded Afghanistan, Dec 24th 1979. But the reality, secretly guarded until now, is completely otherwise."" Brzezinski himself played a fundamental role in crafting U.S. policy, which, unbeknown even to the Mujahideen, was part of a larger strategy ""to induce a Soviet military intervention.""

(Some feared this action might lead to the missiles' capture and copying by the Soviets.) So you have at least six players, including Reagan, involved  five of them conservative Republicans. I guess they made a movie about Charlie Wilson (widely known as ""the liberal from Lufkin"") because he was the only Democrat who ""got it"".I suppose in a Hollywood where ""JFK"" and ""Titanic"" are considered good history, we should not expect anything more.",Charlie Wilson's War

Some of the longer reviews here note that Charlie has created a strong network of Muslim fighters, and has flooded Afganistan with free weapons, which has later resulted in the US being the most hated country.It is a mildly interesting story of a seasoned politician... the end of a movie. However, the continued real-life story has continued in a much more compelling way that this introduction movie.Needless to say that we (the US) have abandoned these Afgan people and the militant leaders we created. Once Gorbachev was hugging Reigan in Washington, we have cut these Afgan people out. Moreove, we started hunting them and have tried to kill their leaders.Unfortunately, as a result of treating Afgan people as pawns, we have received 9/11 and other terrorist acts.Also, has the movie been more insightful, it would've shown the parallel between the Afgan and other similar involvements in Chile, Cuba, Africa, Middle East, Ukraine, Georgia, etc. etc.The main point of the movie should've been that this is not an amusing part of our past history - this is going on even now.

To say that this movie is a disappointment will be an overstatement. It's worse.But let me start at the beginning. The book Charlie Wilson's War is phenomenal: deep, wise, incisive. Movie is dumb, simple, and political. If I was George Crile I would sue producer's ass for destroying the book. Why does Hollywood think that they know everything? Why do they need to add political themes that are not in the book? Why do they add things that in their ""creative,"" drugged, and delusional minds seem right? Why such fine actors as Roberts and Hanks lower themselves to such performances? Bits me.If you truly want to understand how CIA works, how US government works, how intergovernmental relationships work, why Russians really lost that war (btw, as a clear parallel you may learn why we are having so much trouble in Iraq too), and what really went wrong (it was not (just) US not wanting to build schools in Afghanistan) do yourself a favor, read real Charlie Wilson's War.Having said that,let me go back to the beginning.

I don't know if this is normal for the North American take on the situation, but for me it looks incredibly ignorant. Russians are rapists, ruthless invaders who's taking their joy in killing children and destroying peaceful villages. I struggled to find irony there but failed.I hope no one takes this movie as an accurate depiction of this conflict. I hope you'll make your research, you'll look at the pictures of dead youngsters who were thrown into this political mess without proper training or equipment (hello, mandatory draft). A lot of Russian families lost their sons and fathers to this war and they even had no reason to justify the loss.The movie itself is okay. Acting is mostly good (Philip Seymour Hoffman kills it like he always does), story is engaging, dialogues are witty and robust. The finale made the overall ignorance somehow less offensive. The ball keeps bouncing, doesn't it?But the way the movie portraits the motives of Russians is disgusting.

This movie is intelligent, captivating and the acting is outstanding.

256,jefferson5581,This film's dialogue is incredible!,10,9 February 2009,"This film's dialogue is incredible! Sorkin definitely poured some sweat into the word processor on this one. I don't care if the wordplay and rapid-fire banter is realistic or not. It's absolutely freakin' wonderful! Tom Hanks is likable as ever as Charlie Wison, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely perfect casting for the streetwise CIA operative, Gust Avrakotos.The initial meeting between Charlie Wilson and Gust Avrakotos is a riot. It starts with the pair sizing up each other's testosterone levels, then continues through numerous interruptions, character entrances and exits from several doors, a possible indictment, a hastily constructed press statement and legal defense, a gross breach of Wilson's privacy, a minor shouting match, and as grudging professional admirers the pair also shares a drink. Their first meeting ends at a second location with an impromptu Top Secret conference in a Washington park with a chess and weapons expert, and a decision on the soon-to-be-passed-by-congressional-committee budget increase for their newly reformulated covert war.Yes, I said this was their FIRST meeting! And if you weren't paying attention, you missed a work of art.Tom Hanks had to have a lot of fun with the Charlie Wilson character. He apparently listens to everyone, then tells you what he's going to do. And if you don't like what Charlie is doing, here's how Charlie is going to make you like it...and like him. You ain't leaving till you're on his side of the fence. And by the way, would you like some whiskey with that.My favorite Charlie Wilson line: ""You know you've reached rock bottom when you're told you have character flaws by a man who hanged his predecessor in a military coup."" Philip Seymour Hoffman is so sharp, interesting and funny that you don't really see his character as menacing until you have a moment to breathe and think about the situation and the true import of his words. Then, it hits you. Witty or not, Gust Avrakotos is not a fun guy; he's hardcore dangerous. Gust Avrakotos kills Russians for a living, and he's very, very good at it.Julia Roberts as Joanne Herring wields power from the religious right like she got her magic wand straight from Jesus. Congressmen and senators are pawns in her game. She has a bit of a soft spot for Charlie. After all, he is both fun and useful, and she barely minds that Charlie's office is staffed with sluts. The only person Joanne Herring doesn't seem to intimidate and manipulate is Gust Avrakotos. Gust has met too many people like Joanne. ""I like you just fine, Mrs. Herring, it's just been my experience that when people with money and too much free time get involved in politics, pretty soon, I forget who it is I'm supposed to be shooting at."" However, Gust will gladly change his mind and become a believer if she'll sleep with him tonight. Mrs. Herring has other plans.Not to bring you down at the end, but the final message is both serious and accurate. The US deserted Afghanistan when the Russians left. This was very likely, if not the primary, at least one of the main starting points for 9/11.This film can be viewed from numerous perspectives. It's political satire. It's a character study. It's history enacted. It's commentary on the Cold War. But overall, it's great, great fun.I highly recommend viewing Charlie Wilson's War several times. You'll want to hear what you missed the first time because you were laughing so loudly.",Charlie Wilson's War

Just like in Casablanca, there is patriotism, politics, intrigue, a love affair, heartache, and lots of drinking and smoking. Casablanca is on my all-time top ten movie list. Charlie Wilson's War is right up their in that league. What I like more about Charlie's story is that it was a true story. Casablanca was set in a real war, but it was a fictional story.

258,jamzer35,Charlie Wilson's War Deserves Your Attention,9,25 December 2007,"I find it extremely sad that this comment section has been taken over by neo-conservatives who can't see the point of this movie because all they can seem to focus on was the sex, drugs and booze. The point, as I see it, was that despite everyone's character flaws (and we all have them--yes, even you neo-cons believe it or not) weak men can help accomplish great things.Hell, I didn't even know he was a lefty until about half way through the movie when he said he was a liberal.Of COURSE Wilson didn't single handedly end the Cold War just as Ronald Reagan didn't but they BOTH contributed to the down-fall of the USSR. As did the will of the average Russian and the collapse of the Soviet economy but that all seems to get glossed over by the Ronald Reagan sycophant cultists.I can't believe the people who think Hanks didn't do a great job!! Were they watching the same movie as I? The interplay between Wilson (Hanks) and Avrakotos (Hoffman) was what made this movie. Their dynamic sucks you in and makes you feel like you were there following their plight and care about the outcome of their actions.These two characters were compelling in their oddball, unconventional way of getting things done. The streaks of humor were well played and added a another level of interest to these fascinating people. Of course Wilson had some character flaws but that combined with his good intentions and concern for others is what makes him so damn interesting!! I find it amusing that some here can only focus on his partying nature as ""immoral"" and ignore the greater morality that he practices by helping a people who were being mostly ignored.Julia Roberts was good but not on the level of Hanks and Hoffman. Her accent kept slipping but overall her character was believable. I was fascinated with this woman and the juxtaposition between her cold hearted appearance and her true heart of gold.This film helps me believe again that our politicians have great potential if pointed in the right direction and shown what is at stake. Speaking of politicians, it was very interesting to get a peak behind the curtain and see how politics gets hammered out in America.Overall I expect great things from the awards season for this film.",Charlie Wilson's War

Even if all the guys in the movie want to sleep with Joanne still she is not attractive!Fast quotes do not make a movie interesting. This is supposed to be cinema, not radio program. The only good actor was the Greek CIA agent.On the historical and political end, this movie was stupid.No one in the US administration had thought of interfering in Afghanistan till Joanne talked Charlie into it with her Christian visions!Portraying Russians as rapists and children killers and cheaters and Americans as decent people who cared about poverty and oppression of women!",Charlie Wilson's War

261,nunjunk,Entertaining or thought provoking?,9,26 September 2009,"Aaron Sorkin is that rare writer that can seamlessly blend an engaging tale with really interesting questions. His West Wing episodes stand as some of the best television ever produced.Charlie Wilson's War recapitulates the hallmarks of the West Wing's success: engaging, larger than life characters; acceptance of the ambiguity inherent in all complex issues; dialog that pleases the ear and tickles the fancy.Browsing the reviews here will quickly demonstrate the power and nuance of the film. Reviewers draw diverse conclusions about the message delivered, the moral qualities of the protagonists, and the impact of Charlie's efforts.All of this provocative thoughtfulness doesn't come at the expense of the entertainment value, in fact, it enhances the entertainment. When a boyish chess master delivers a spot on summary of the weaponry required for an insurgency to defeat a modern army it is simultaneously informative and really funny.I like to think that Aaron Sorkin is on a mission to save us all from Santayana's curse: Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it. If you can watch Charlie Wilson's War without thinking about the consequences of conflicts in Vietnam (French and U.S.), Afganistan (USSR and U.S.) and Iraq you need to read some history.",Charlie Wilson's War

The acting of Tom Hanks was really nice, but seeing Julia Roberts acting elder person than she is was rather strange, but nevertheless acting was nice.. The war is a great, horrible disaster.USSR was not the one country who made people of Afghanistan suffer. And in the end of the movie we can see, that there is no ""happy ending""..

I read numerous books on that era & found out that amazingly almost every thing they showed in this movie is correct. Of course the Afghani tribalism and the role of Pakistani intelligence's contribution & planning were not discussed but people need to remember that it was a movie about Charlie Wilson and not the Afghan war. It looks like that some of the facts were deliberately shown incorrectly such as Afghan Cmdr Massoud receiving the majority of the aid from US. I also believed that the Pakistani President Zia's role was not done in the right way by Indian Actor Om Puri. The only thing matching was his hair style.

This has to be one of the worst insert shots ever, an embarrassment to all involved.Then followed by two more Afghanis launching rockets at the same Soviet chopper.This shot would be bad if it was on ""The Dukes of Hazzard"", but it's unforgivable on such a high brow film.I've discussed this with many fans who all laugh about this lame,comical hack job!

266,abmoorhead,Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance,7,5 January 2008,"I have to say I was a little disappointed by this movie, with such a strong cast I expected a bit more. The thing that saved this movie for me was Hoffman's performance as CIA agent Gust Avrakotos. Hoffman proves again that he is one of the best character actors of our time. The best scene in the whole movie is when Hoffman is arguing with his boss, it's absolutely hilarious. Tom hanks once said something along the lines of ""when your on the screen with Julia Roberts you are being upstaged"". Sorry Julia, but this time, Hoffman steals the show. He deserves a nomination for best supporting actor. Unfortunately for Hoffman, He doesn't stand much of a chance at a win against the likes of Havier Bardem. (No Country For Old Men). Still a noteworthy performance deserving some recognition.",Charlie Wilson's War

However,the main idea,presented by producer,is being found at the end. The American government spent 1 billion of dollars for providing the Afgans weapons, but they grudged just one million to build a school.

269,andersonxl,Was there something else then clichés?,1,10 February 2008,"This 'flick' would even make Jerry Bruckheimer jealous. It contained everything an American blockbuster should have, in order to be classified as an unthoughtful, non-educational, never thought-provoking shameless money-maker.Well, the money comes in thanks to an overacting Julia Roberts and a misinterpretation of George Crile's book by Tom Hanks. Instead of focusing on the real issues that came with the cold war, it was about the private scores a stupid white redneck (Charlie Wilson) who had no idea about any idea(l) at all. Wilson cared only for breasts, butts and whiskey: which were precisely the main anchors of this script.That makes this film a missed opportunity. There were so many possibilities to create a well- documented film about the  at the moment very actual  real consequences of the Cold War, that eventually culminated in the New York attacks. To bad George Clooney (he tried!) couldn't get the rights of the original book. I assume that in his hands the script would focus more on how international policies, governed by the United States, influence the development of worldly events.Instead of a search for cause and effect, it turned out to be a plea for patriotism, sexism, moral-ism and opportunism: the women were heavy breasted dumb nut shelves, the Afghans were backward apelike jumping idiots, the Pakistani's hardcore fundamentalists, the U.S. (of course) as always the altruistic saviours of morality, and let's not forget our beloved Charlie: a true hero.

Furthermore, Tom Hanks is complimented by the unparalleled acting ability of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I have never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly.The film is witty, intelligent and well written.

This movie doesn't take itself too seriously although the reality is everything but funny. I think that Tom Hanks is well cast, his self mockery and his fat head makes him the perfect man for the job. To my surprise I can't get enough of Julia Roberts.

The next scene after the Awards ceremony is Charlie in a Hot-Tub with some naked women and a guy trying to get him to invest in a TV programme. Another rather amusing scene is about 3 quarters into the film comprises Charlie, a group of his rather sexy Secretaries, Phillip Seymour Hoffmans CIA Man and a bottle of Whisky. As to dialogue what about this for a line, ""The Senator says, He can teach us to type but can't teach us to grow Tits."". OK, School-boyish I know but the film is laced with great lines.As to performances well Phillip Seymour Hoffman as usual steals every scene he's in. Hanks is OK but surprisingly to me anyway was Julia Roberts who is very good in the role of a rather eccentric Texas Oil Millionairess.Charlie Wilson's War is one of the best non Musician Bio-pics in a long while as well as being that rare thing a film that entertains, amuses as well as informs all in equal measure.",Charlie Wilson's War

I read the blurb on the front of the DVD box and it said ""Brilliantly funny"". Pardon me there was nothing in it that would rate as slightly funny. The lack of characterisation was frustrating, and really unacceptable, firstly we suddenly see the lead character naked in a hot tub with several women and at least one man, he explains without prompting that he is a congressman when surely he would be more likely to hide the fact, at least until he had got one of the hookers into bed.(Or is that how all politicians behave?) Julia Roberts, now an interesting choice of casting, great actress, but this part needed a Meryl Streep, and just how and why did she contact Wilson? Her motive or interest was never explained. Wilson's first visit to Afghanistan was badly handled, the meeting with the prime minister very shallow, would he really have been in the room without any sort military adviser, he seemed very lacking in diplomatic skills? The visit to the refugee camp didn't raise any emotion. The 'Russian' fighters being 'shot down' were allied aircraft footage, from stock shots. All in all a very unsatisfactory and unmemorable film.",Charlie Wilson's War

Which is precisely why American audiences will watch this in droves. Tom Hanks has portrayed a Texan democrat with loose moral restraints, quite admirably. The honors though go to Philip Seymour Hoffman for his role as a no-nonsense, hard-nosed spook par-extraordinaire. His verbal spar with was the high-point for me. Julia Roberts provides the much unintended shock value to the movie and i am sure this movie will haunt her makeup artist for a long time.The movie is blatantly, anti-communist and so is a reasonable portrayal of American sentiment of the time. Basically each scene tries to out-do the previous one in terms of profanity and shock-value and at some point, the director decides he has had enough and ends the movie.

276,alexei_jur,Simply one of the worst movies ever!!!,1,14 March 2013,"I expected so much more from this movieA great cast, based on a true story, high current IMDb rating.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Sadly enough, what it all boiled down to, is a disgusting display of American/CIA propaganda, obnoxious American self-righteousness and total lack of respect for human life.Frankly, I lost the count of how many times the characters in this movie shout out things like: ""Kill the Russians!!!"", ""F*kc the Russians!!!"" etc. Soviet army is portrayed as a gang of blood-thirsty butchers, specifically hunting down Afghan children to molest, disfigure and kill them in the worst way possible.To say that this movie is just a fiction of some sick and twisted mind, is not to say anything. The propaganda content in this movie is so high that even Goebbels would be impressed.I sat through the whole movie, waiting for some kind of twist, a moment where the director would display his ability to actually think clear, a moment that would show the real consequences of the atrocities committed by CIA and Charlie Wilson. But I waited in vain. This moment never came. It was like having a never-ending nightmare.I felt literally sick after watching this movie. I realized that I just wasted more than 2 hours of my life on one of the worst movies ever made. What made it even worse, is the high rating of ""Charlie Wilson's war"" at IMDb, as this indicates that there are pour souls out there, who actually felt for this fraud, swallowed the poisonous propaganda, without even realizing that they have been scammed and damaged for life.",Charlie Wilson's War

278,Film-Intel,An absent Wilson,6,17 January 2008,"Phillip Seymour Hoffman's stinging wit in this film will be matched, in level, only by the frustration viewers will feel when the end credits role.The main conceit (we track congressman Charlie Wilson as he attempts to supply enough arms to Afghan resistance fighters in order to facilitate them in cleaning the Soviets out of Afghanistan)is well executed and humorously portrayed with Hanks a willing and skillful recipient of Hoffman's much publicised show stealing antics as disgruntled C.I.A agent Gust Avrakotos (the scene in Wilson's office is the highlight).However, it is not just Hoffman who steals the show, nor is it the under-developed, under-used, under-acting Julia Roberts, playing socialite Joanne Herring whose existence in this piece is paid nothing more and, quite possibly, considerably less than lip-service. Amy Adams however, as Wilson's nagging yet affectionate assistant is fantastic despite being given lines which lack both depth and gumption. Adams manages to change a character apparently only included to point out to the audience whether Wilson is currently acting debauched or as the peak of morality into a three dimensional figure who lights every scene and provides Hank's character with the only opponent he can never overcome.Under-developed characters are not, however, this films main weakness. Whilst it does an admirable job in relating to us the tale of Wilson's most famous endeavour the man himself is sadly lost behind the jokes and the guns, the girls and the bathtubs. Wilson is fascinating; a drunk by day and night whose greatest achievement in congress was 'getting himself re-elected six times', he suddenly turns into moral crusader for the oppressed Afghans at the flick of a switch. Baleful shots towards the films conclusion hint that Wilson is not only upset about the outcome but genuinely hurt and depressed yet we are never told how he ended up in this state or what happened to him after his endeavours into Afghanistan. Whether Nichols decided to make this decision due to the fact that the real-life Wilson is very much alive (and indeed attended the premiere) is by-the-by as he sacrifices character integrity for plot manoeuvrability, only to have what little there is left of his character undermine everything.An enjoyable film with decent performances from most of its many characters.

The first time was just like normal .... few years ago .... like watching any other movie.
I like Tom Hanks.
That's why I watched.I watched a second time recently because I remembered it was pretty good.
After this second viewing I looked at the IMDB page to see cast members.
That prompted me to watch it a third time again this evening, specifically looking for Lara Flynn Boyle since I was rather surprised to see her listed in the cast as ""Charlie's Assistant"" (uncredited).
I didn't remember seeing her in either of the other two times and I am pretty good at spotting actor cameos.
Still, I am only human.
I might have missed it.
So I watched closely.
Really closely.
I was on a mission.
I paused the playback numerous times to look closely at some of the characters.She is not in the movie.

Furthermore, they do this without making Islamists the enemy AND without making Republicans the enemy, since it's the Republicans that are in office and are doing this supposedly great thing, bringing down the USSR by covertly supplying a war in Afghanistan.But seriously now . . . do we really want a movie that repeatedly says ""let's go kill some Russians!"" like that's the greatest thing a red-blooded American can do? And are we supposed to find this congressman adorable because he surrounds himself with women with big hair and revealing clothes? Even his supposedly smart assistant, who is always dressed professionally, keeps looking at Charlie like he's just the most wonderful, handsomest, greatest guy around.

Instead we are taken on a magic carpet ride where a ribs n hookers Congressman decides, along with a Texan socialite with a heart of pure gold, to help orphaned children and build hospitals. Yep, that's the extent of the political context we are giving here. This movie could only really have been made for an American audience.It's so sweet that that people still have such pure and kindly motives when there are evil doers in the world.There is no plot to speak of and the funniest moments come when watching somw of the most culturally monochrome and insular characters you could find dress up in ethnic Afghan costume and celebrate with people they would never understand and who they would bombing back to the stone age a short time later. Imagine Boss Hogg from the Dukes of Hazard jumping up and down in Afghan tribal dress in the middle of the desert with mujahadeen, and you are almost there. It's a credit to the producer he didn't throw in a few girls in bikinis.Still, Hanks is watchable and Roberts is pretty, though she looks garish and her features have never looked as sharpened and exaggerated as they do here. I kept watching it because I hoped it would get better, but it never did.I wasted 2 hours of my life watching this and it reminds how useful Hollywood is at producing propaganda and the limits of what commercial film can achieve.If KFC made a movie about the Soviet Afghan campaign, this would be it.",Charlie Wilson's War

I also find it offensive to draw parallels between the action of Charlie Wilson and the collapse of a superpower, which is supposed the be the motto of the story. The sad truth is that the result of Wilson's actions is not the end of Russia, which in fact is being rebuilt as an economic and military powerhouse, but 9/11 with all it's consequences. The film makes no such comparisons and, hence, becomes ridden with clichés rooted in one-sided perspective and an extremely dangerous superficial look at the Afgan - Soviet war. Charlie Wilson is not an American hero, but a fund-raiser for mujahadeen terrorists who in fact are killing the Americans oversees now. I had a very high expectation before this film was coming out, because I thought well finally someone even addresses the issue of Wilson's direct involvement in what eventually became the springboard of Muslim radicalism.

When he sees Dan Rather reporting on the Afghan mujahadin trying to shoot down Soviet helicopters with ""Davy Crockett rifles"", he decides to help. More to prove his clout on Capitol Hill than anything else, he gets funding for the CIA's support of the ""freedom fighters"" doubled --- from $5 to $10 million.It's a meaningless gesture, but it leads to some unexpected consequences: an agonizing visit to an Afghan refugee camp and an uneasy alliance with a disgruntled CIA operative (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance).

Also depressing to realize how many folks love to kill people to accomplish a good deed but can't be bothered to spend a little money to do the right thing when it just means helping a few kids in a faraway country.

He wants to tell it all, so he goes fast at it. In fact, so fast that during my 5 minutes visit to the bathroom apparently I missed an entire episode when all the money for the operation were collected and a major arm deal was signed by multiple parties. The rest of Charlie Wilson's story is told whispered in secret meeting rooms, hidden in boudoirs, swished through brilliant white teeth framed by red lips, or screamed in foreign accents. It is no wonder that one can easily miss one or two pieces of possibly important information. But this is the beauty of the film. After the credentials, the questions are pouring in ; what , when and how, and mostly who. Who is Charlie Wilson and why no one ever heard of him until the movie was released? Like a good history teacher, Charlie Wilson's War makes you think and makes you look for answers, some missed in the movie for the above reasons. And one cannot help wonder what channels was she flipping through when Dan Rather was presenting live on TV reports on one of the big tragedies of the century? There is a story in the story; at times, we face episodes, such as the events that lead to the creation of Afghan refugee camps, so terrible that the very fabric of the entire humanity seems threaten . Against those episodes, and during those times, the movie tells us that liberals and conservatives, womanizers and feminists, right and left, west and east, Israel and Egypt pull it together to help one to save us all.

With a script by Aaron Sorkin (one of my favorites) I really expected poignant, pointed dialogue, a semblance of intensity and seriousness for the subject matter, and more than just old 70's footage of Afghanistan.Instead, what I got were cheesy, over the top performances, poor dialogue and cinematography, and no sophistication. The story was told in such a choppy way, it leaves the impression that perhaps some of the ""good stuff"" is still sitting on the editing floor. Unexpected from a veteran Editor like John Bloom.The movie was amusing at several points, and Hanks was his usual gregarious self. Phillip Seymour Hoffman gave the best performance of the entire movie and held every scene in which he appeared. Julia Roberts was, well, Julia Roberts.I don't recommend spending $10 to see this in the movie theater. Wait and rent the DVD...and if nudity and drugs and plenty of expletives offend you, wait for the TV version...at least you'll get less of them.I can't understand why this movie would win any awards other than it is politically correct from Hollywood's point of view.My rating? Wait for the DVD.",Charlie Wilson's War
290,marisanlaurant,Movie not to be taken seriously,6,26 December 2007,"This movie represents one-sidedness of the US media. Real historians may be able to spot many inaccuracies in this movie: e.g., Soviet hasn't been collapsed by the Afgan war, let alone by this Charlie guy; depiction of the usual ""good US"" and ""bad USSR"" who invaded Afgan is a typical GOP (and some Dems') propaganda to support the current war in Iraq. The initial bathtub scene with naked ladies looks more like a scene in Hue Hefner's Play boy mansion, adding nothing but an extra silliness to the movie. I don't know if playing of the Joanne character helps Julia Roberts either. When she said that she was ""passionate"" about Afgan, I started to wonder if she was more ""passionate"" about nourishing her own ego. I didn't see any like-ability in the Charlie's character either because of the same reason as others mentioned. Hanks may be a miscast for the movie. He can never simulate Clark Gable or Humphrey Boagart. Only savor is Hoffman's acting which I thought, was genuinely funny. The traveling to Afganistan, Jerusalem, to Egypt adds to the scale of this movie, without making it more like James Bond's. Overall, this movie is just another Hollywood entertainment, and it's politics cannot be taken seriously.",Charlie Wilson's War
291,Bugzini,Not worth it,4,27 December 2007,"Was I watching the same film that people gave 9 stars for? You have to kidding me. Phillip Seymor Hoffman is the only thing good, he seems natural, well preparred and at ease. The lines written by Sorkin when delivered by Julia Roberts are bland and unnatural (no one spouts facts and figures like that unless you are a character on the West Wing) The scene where Hoffman is introduced to Hanks's character while also doing a door opening & closing bit with his secretaries was just horrible. What is this a farce or facts!? Yet another movie where just about every 'good' part is given away in the trailers. Do not pay movie prices to see this; wait for DVD, or spend your time watching the HistoryChannel or CSPAN.",Charlie Wilson's War
292,braylove7,Horrible Accents,5,29 December 2007,"If I were Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts I would be embarrassed of my lack of research in making this film. Both of their accents were horrible. Tom Hanks is supposed to represent an East Texas accent and Julia Roberts is supposed to be from Houston. I live in Houston and grew up in East Texas. What kind of stupid accent were they portraying. Their accents weren't even close to accurate. Why does Hollywood keep making movies with stupid inaccurate accents? Tom and Julia take a lesson from Ryan Gosling or Matt Damon, both of them have figured out a proper southern accent. Oh and the movie was a waste of money. The story was OK, but didn't lead anywhere good.",Charlie Wilson's War
293,flawiuss,"emotional movie, very realistic",10,31 December 2007,"This was a great movie, a movie that you will not forget! Very good acting, very good directing... When I saw the name of the movie I was not impressed. I just had to see a little of the trailer movie to convince me. The movie starts unusual with some naked women in a jacuzzi and Tom Hanks, the Tom Hanks. Then, like a white lite, comes Julia Roberts, and plays her role very very well. This combination of big actors could't create nothing else than a very very well acted movie, a movie that not only shows you a piece of what really happened,of the reality, but really move your soul. It feels like you are there, living the the same feeling of the pour children and women. You just have to see the movie !",Charlie Wilson's War
294,s-nethercott,Interesting Film - have to be a fan of US foreign policy though,5,1 January 2008,"This is an interesting film, which is well shot, acted, and written. The characters are quirky, and certainly not without flaws themselves. This adds to the film's charm.However, the politics of the film are another matter. The funding of the afghan resistance ended up being a pretty significant event - and not for the reasons noted in the film. Its interesting how 10 years can make friends into sworn enemies.We all know who won the cold war, but a one sided view of who are the villains and heroes is a bit much here. There are lots of examples of bad behaviour on both sides during this period (Central America) so I found the subject matter a little preachy personally ... but still worth a viewing!",Charlie Wilson's War
295,dgeridoo,Say What?,4,1 January 2008,"Very curious that Nichols and Hanks would team up for this, obviously they believe it. Strange because it should carry the title ""Charlie Wilson's War the Lie.How could the time frame leave out the real history that while ridding Afganistan of the Russians the CIA was providing support for the Taliban, and today's World of Terrorism. In 1990, Bin Laden went home to Saudi Arabia as a hero of jihad, who along with his Arab legion, ""had brought down the mighty superpower"" of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. To avoid any connection to Osama Bin Laden is to say again, Hollywood cares little for Historical Truth. Charlie Wilson, a patriot, hardly, more like a congressman gone amok.",Charlie Wilson's War
296,garykim-denver,Fantastic,10,2 January 2008,"It's nice to see a film that shows flawed human beings rising above those limitations and doing important and laudable things. I was prepared for a simplistic ""good guy, bad guy"" treatment. I was entranced when that wasn't the treatment. It also was refreshing that the stock ""America is the bad guy"" approach wasn't taken.Mistakes get made. People are flawed. People have self interests and aren't always completely altruistic.Despite all that, there is a difference between moral good and evil, and though we might disagree about the precise nature of what constitutes genuine evil, evil exists. Evil impinges on people. Evil sometimes cannot be ignored. Without jingoism, this film is a reflection on that theme.",Charlie Wilson's War
297,jeff271,Well worth seeing,7,6 January 2008,"Any movie Tom Hanks makes should and, does, draw the crowds. Why? Because he is one of the finest actors in the world that can pull nearly any role off and make it believable. His main counterpart, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, should be nominated for an award in this film - truly brilliant.As for the individuals who have submitted comments about the film that merely want to slam it based on politics, war, Presidents and congressman, of which they fervently denigrate, I have this to say, ""Get over it and grow up!"" The real world works this way whether you like it or not - once you pull your heads out of the sand and gain real knowledge about what happens in the world (can't do that by watching CNN, BBC, Fox News, etc.) maybe you won't be so bitter when posting a comment about a movie.But, I am glad you have the freedom to speak your mind and I support your right to do it!",Charlie Wilson's War
298,francodadi,A very Bad Film,1,12 January 2008,"I was really waiting for a masterpiece: all the cast was very well known and it was a long time since Julia Roberts last played in a Film. This film deeply disillusioned me. The Plot even if it's from a real story is definitely weak.Not only there's a one way point of view , that is the Americans but also the topic is treated with such thoughtlessness and imprudence. Also moral issues are involved and the main character, Tom Hanks is depicted with an arrogant character: he is always drinking whiskey, going with stripper in Las Vegas.The fact that he is a member of the congress and does whatever he want despite the decisions should be taken with democracy not only lowers the trust in institutions but also makes me think with another eye to the American heroes. About Julia Roberts i can say she appears only as an extra in the film, she doesn't express any emotions and also her morality is tottering. I advise not to see this films for me was only a waste of time and made me worry..",Charlie Wilson's War

Excellent screen play:It made me, the audience, feel that I was right there. 2. Well-directed:Screen play provides the base.However, it was the director's capability to extract some of the best performances from the players on the set which includes the camera folks, actors/actresses, and the rest of the supporting crew !3. Good adaptation:I happened to do a quick-and-dirty read of the book while on a 4-hr flight. I read the book after the movie as I wanted to dig some more details. I realized that the movie was fairly well-adapted. About acting, the most surprising for me was that of Phillip Seymour Hoffman ! It was a fairly natural acting performed by this side role - though he wasn't the prime focal point for the movie.",Charlie Wilson's War

301,slambob2,Entertaining and insightful,8,24 March 2008,"It was a fascinating peek behind the curtain into how politics works and how America has acted in the world. The storyline veers only slightly in the name of partisan politics when Tom Hanks character awkwardly states that John Murtha was ""pure as the driven snow"", but it takes an even-handed and courageously disturbing look at the actions and consequences of wars started and peace ignored.This movie is perfect for the Frasier fan in its clever, fast-paced banter and entertaining for any Tom Hanks fan. The ending, and the point at which you realize the Afghan rebels are only slightly different than the insurgents in Iraq (from the Arab point of view) leave you with a residue of uncomfortable thought about the impact of American involvement in Iraq twenty years from now and the potential for disaster if we fail to fulfill our commitment to help rebuild that country.The Hollywood ending is not the rote ""happily ever after"" but rather the bow that ties it all up in a single too-simple sentence. Still, very satisfying overall.It's the first movie in a while that I would watch a second time.",Charlie Wilson's War

Who did invention of that?? Hollywood portrays Russian army as horrible, dreadful troops of evil! That is disgusting!! United States President Jimmy Carter had accepted the view that ""Soviet aggression"" could not be viewed as an isolated event of limited geographical importance but had to be contested as a potential threat to the Persian Gulf region.

Even though the main rolls were filled by legendary actors, they made me feel as if I were watching them for the first time. The timing kept me glued to the screen as only the best movies can. The dialog was so real it made me feel as if the actors were indeed making this up on the spot as in real life. The music was intense and yet playful. I could really feel like a part of the moment. The adult content was brief and tasteful. Any overtness was inherent in the character's persona and not forced. The overall effect was as great as the ocean: fluid and powerful with the momentum to destroy perception and gentle enough to support the life of new ideas.",Charlie Wilson's War

Stott's Israeli (Hebrew) accent was dreadful, the deputy Egyptian defence minister's Egyptian Arabic accent was even more laughable. Why not just cast an Israeli and an Arab in these roles??????? Om Puri as Zia Ul Haq had a convincing accent, the Russian helicopter pilots spoke Russian - so why Stott?Otherwise I liked the film - the dialogue was snappy, Hanks was laconic and witty, the CIA guy was great, his dialogue where he breaks the CIA office window was great, Julia Roberts was OK.",Charlie Wilson's War
305,rln1941,Charlie Wilson's War,10,26 January 2010,It was a very good insight into how things work in this capitalistic empire we are forced to inhabit. I like the fact that Russia got kicked in the pants. It was a about time for those Stalinist Ingrates! The fact that a womanizer and drunk could bring it off just showed how corrupt our government is and out of control. Is it any wonder a terrorist can sneak through an airport gauntlet line? It is only a matter of time for another attack on America. The clock is ticking and we have an idiot for president who has not a clue on what to do.

Also communism was not horrible especially under Brezhnev rule(those were not 1930's anymore and not civil war in 1920's). I see antirussian propaganda everywhere these days but this disgusted me more then others because you show taliban like some sort of freedom fighters(but now you view them different aren't you?). Those freedom fighters take skin off alive Russian soldiers. Also russians never dropped children toy mines that's piteful lies. And the pilots scene also was arrogant ""Hey let's hunt some woman and children. Btw I cheated on my wife. Happy hunting."" Just like CIA spread lies during the war Hollywood spreads lies 20 years after the war. USA has honor or what?My friend died in that war he was a pilot and I was not happy when I was at his funeral.

307,ahmedmal2001,"""Charlie Wilson's War"" an example of a realistic movie",9,4 January 2008,"From my point of view, as an Arabic citizen, I think this is one of the best movies. This movie gives an example of how can we expect the good thing from anyone, although this one could not be from our religion, country, or even have our belief, but he has feeling in helping other people just because they are dying under the attack of their enemies. He is not involved, unless he is asked by someone else to go and see how some people are dying with no mercy, and how they live in tents with no enough food, water, or medicine. He shocks, and gives promises to do some help and he does.Tom Hank plays the character of the gay how likes to drink and have sex with women, and how doesn't care about anything else, but he does what ever he can to help the Afghans, and at the same time he doesn't change his life style, he doesn't stop drinking or meeting other women, he continues his life as it is, but he takes the challenge of saving the Afghans, and he manages to at the end. Although, he succeed in his goal, and the others how help him were just want to have the benefit for their personal attitude, but he continues working and working even after the Soviet Union army left Afghanistan, but he discovers at the end how he cannot continue, because those who agree with him took their benefits and they done.I really like this movie and I hope everyone who watches this movie should notice the lessons the story is trying to show to the audience.",Charlie Wilson's War

309,alexanderurquhart,Cheap Shots,2,21 July 2008,"Things began very well with this film, I found myself enamoured with the characters immediately and the backdrop drew me in. I was happily settled down into what I hoped would be an engaging look at a controversial part of American history. After all I knew the subject matter and I also knew it would be delicate but I seemed to be in capable hands.Unfortunately I began to notice a distinct void in the proceedings. Where I expected political commentary I found emptiness, where I expected satire I found only flag waving anti-communist propaganda that should have been put to bed 20 years ago.The scene with the two soviet pilots discussing their own indiscretions, briefly painting them as immoral, before they are shot down and given what they deserve. If this was satire, it was far to subtle for me, it seemed to be from the 'commando comic' school of script writing. War films, nowadays, should not be giving us two dimensional characterisations of the enemy.Long lingering looks at the traumas of the Afghans suffered under the soviet invasion, how does this relate to the men of power and money in Washington and are they really trying to tell us this was ANY part of their decision to provide so much financial aid. Lies about booby trapped toys for Afghan kids, perpetuating soviet myths 20 years after they are relevant, do we really need to be doing this now.There is so much macho dialogue and warmongering in this film that the crux of the plot line is practically ignored. Who cares if they 'fucked up the end game' when Seymour Hoffman, can say 'fuck em' to the commies at the end of the film.A film can be be found wanting in any single element and I would still give it a good rating. This film has great acting, characters, dialog and a wonderful sense of time and place. It is severely lacking backbone, however, and despite the best intentions of its subject matter, I cannot see past that. For days afterwards I told myself, it was just a very clever satire, but there is only so long I could keep spinning that line to myself. The film is a militaristic wolf in a lefty liberal sheep's clothing.",Charlie Wilson's War
310,arl924jig,What an unexpectedly amazing film,9,25 December 2007,"I thankfully knew little about this movie before I saw it on Christmas evening. It was spectacular. Everyone was great, especially PSH. He cracks me up ever since he was the fat dork who couldn't find a shirt that fit in Boogie Nights. I have to say the trailers I did see on TV made it out as a comedy, and though I laughed out loud, it was so much more. The scenes from Afganistan were tragic. I was moved when the camera panned out in what seemed unending tents of refugees. To think those very children are who we are fighting today is eye opening to say the least. And yet the whole movie is peppered with hilarious writing, I fell out when Tom hanks yelled out ""Jail Bait!"" calling for the help of his staff. Very telling and yet not your average documentary.",Charlie Wilson's War

The characters are not fully developed, therefore you don't feel for them, you are not with them all the time. A lot of continuity errors and unclear moments drive you away from the story. E.g. half of the Afganistan refugees can speak perfect English, even in news report, and not to be ignorant, but as it is said in film they can't even read, how come they speak English with hardly any accent?The film had good intentions, and I went to cinema with high expectations, unfortunately unfulfilled.",Charlie Wilson's War

I was fooled by the reviews into thinking this was going to be a thorough and balanced look at the 1980s war in Afghanistan and the covert American involvement in it. Instead, that conflict was presented in cartoonish, propaganda-level terms. The communist forces were thoroughly demonized and dehumanized. Some examples from the movie: helicopters gunning down women and children, women raped, pregnant women bayoneted, toy mines to maim the children, massive, run-down refugee camps, etc. etc. The basic message was that the Soviets and Afghan communists were pure evil and deserved everything coming to them. The movie never considered the possibility that perhaps a communist Afghanistan would have been better for everyone in the long run than an Afghanistan run by tribal warlords and religious fanatics. Instead, the point that the movie hammered home was that what Charlie Wilson did was great and wonderful, and the only problem was that there was no follow-through.

I live in Russia, not in the US. I don't know how US politics act, how they speak, what they like & where they sleep. I can't say that such a man as Charly Wilson can't be shown as in this movie. But I know much more about War in Afganistan & about Soviets. And I know, WHAT was raised by such men as Charlie Wilson. So when Tom Hanks show us some poor little Afgan rebels & cruel ugly soviet soldiers I want to ask Tom: Are You Crasy? Yes, you may be proud, that The Soviet Union lost that war due to US influence, than you may be proud, that The Soviet Union crashed due to this lost, e.t.c. BUT! You may not show that ""Black"" is ""White"". You should show that terrorism in this region is raised on US money & until now no one can stop it. And that's the truth about this war - the CHAOS in the Middle East was created by such men as Charlie Wilson. These men are Criminals and should be judged, because too many people were killed, too many cities were destroyed... In 1988 I saw veterans of this war without legs & arms - they picked up from the ground toys, that where filled with explosives by Charly Wilson's ""rebels"", they were trying to help people & got fire in there backs, because Charly Wilson gave money to support bandits... And what we see in this film? Soviet soldiers, as terrorists, put explosives into toys and laugh...& throw this toys to Afgan Children... And then, WOW! Good rebels kill bad Russian soldiers!!! And people all around the world should think that it's true... And nothing about cutting off heads, teaching children to kill, making drugs, violence against women - ALL THE THINGS the Soviets tried to protect people from. Maybe You don't know, but for Russian soldiers it was an international duty - to protect people in friendly country. And they really tried to do it. Well, You may think that Russians drink vodka all day long, dance with bears & eat ice on breakfast, then this film is for You. So, on my opinion, this film is only propaganda.
