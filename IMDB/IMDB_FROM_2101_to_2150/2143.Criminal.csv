0,MartinHafer,An interesting plot idea...but also some really important plot holes.,6,27 October 2016,"The idea behind ""Criminal"" is pretty exciting and in some ways reminiscent of a really great film, ""Source Code"". However, the film occasionally resorts to excessive violence and explosions and has many plot holes....things which keep the film from being as good as it should have been.When the film begins, Billy Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is being chased through London but you aren't sure who is chasing him or why. Soon he's taken prisoner and tortured to death...which turns out to be just awful considering that he was a CIA agent and he was working hard to prevent the codes to the nation's nuclear bombs to be sold by 'the Dutchman'. With no other options, the government attempts something right out of science fiction--to implant the dead man's memories into a prisoner with the hopes that this prisoner, Jerico (Kevin Costner), will help them find the Dutchman. Unfortunately, the operation appears to be a failure and the agent in charge (Gary Oldman) orders the prisoner to be 'taken care of' (presumably this means killed). However, the CIA does a craptastic job and Jerico soon escapes. No biggie...as he's only a manic serial killer who makes Hannibal Lecter seem like a pussycat! However, something odd happens...slowly, through the course of the film Billy's memories begin to haunt Jerico and he develops the beginnings of a conscience for the first time in his life. So what's next?The story idea described above (apart from the ridiculously easy escape Jerico makes) is excellent. So why am I so ambivalent about the film? Well, too often the film just goes for gore and blood...and the intelligent plot seems, at times, secondary. Additionally, again and again, things work out too perfectly and Jerico escapes CIA custody TWICE!!! Because of this, it's a gory turn off your brain sort of film...when it should have been so much more.By the way, at the end, the film makes it appear that a sequel will be in the works. Considering how badly it did at the box office, I am very, very doubtful if this will EVER happen.",Criminal
1,SnoopyStyle,the growling Costner,4,11 February 2017,"CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is captured and killed by a dangerous group in London leaving behind his wife Jill (Gal Gadot) and daughter. A hacker named The Dutchman (Michael Pitt) and a large amount of money goes missing. Nuclear codes have been compromised. CIA manager Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) seeks out Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones) for help. Franks is experimenting with transferring memories. They find dangerous prisoner Jerico (Kevin Costner) uniquely qualified to be a subject for the highly questionable procedure to receive Bill's memories. After the procedure, Jerico violently escapes.First, it's a mistake to have Ryan Reynolds as the early lead. When he's quickly killed, there is a star-size hole in the movie. It's fine to use an unknown actor in that role. Kevin Costner steps up to fill the hole but he's doing it against type. He's also growling rather than speaking his lines. His first appearance is a little laughable especially since he's in a prison in America. The story is somewhat messy. It's trying to be Bourne-like but Jerico is no where near as appealing. There are some functional action scenes but nothing extraordinary. This is a lesser B-movie that doesn't really make it.",Criminal
2,Prismark10,Criminally wasted,3,5 August 2017,"Criminal is a convoluted and messy film that rips off Face/Off and The Bourne Identity type of movies.Young CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is tortured and electrocuted to death in London by a Spanish anarchist who is after a Dutch hacker that Bill is protecting.The CIA operative Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) keeps Bill from being brain dead and asks Dr Franks (Tommy Lee Jones) to do an experimental procedure to transfer Bill's memories to a dangerous and violent top security prisoner Jerico Stewart (Kevin Costner) qualified for this medical procedure as he has an underdeveloped frontal lobe.Jerico seeks out Bill's widow Jillian (Gal Gadot) and his daughter and slowly he gains Bill's memories as well as skills.There is an all star cast but they are manly wasted. Ryan Reynolds is killed off early into the film. Oldman shouts a lot, Lee Jones just makes a wasted cameo. Costner plays his gruff, unsympathetic character which he has been playing for the last quarter of a century.The film is really a B film with some naff special effects, choppy editing and sloppy writing.",Criminal
3,nogodnomasters,"You hurt me, I hurt you worse.",7,2 December 2017,"Ryan Reynolds is an over billed CIA wuss who gets killed in the first scene. However his mind is the only one that can save the world from Michael Pitt, ""The Dutchman"" who has that proverbial Internet thing to launch missiles that has become far too cliché in films. Ryan worked for Zorg (Gary Oldman) who doesn't care if he is dead, he is still going to make him do his job. Bring in Dr. Tommy Lee Jones in not his most convincing role (Oldman and Lee seriously needed to swap roles as did Costner and anybody else). It seems our doctor has never heard of Frankenstein as he puts Reynolds memory into Costner sporting a new Mohawk, who is also the world's biggest sociopath. He is in a penitentiary, and not a CEO.At this point we resort to the standard spy film formula and not so much the Frankenstein formula, although I would have really enjoyed just one ""fire bad."" In spite of my review, I did find the film mildly entertaining as I do when people get killed by a tough guy.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Criminal
4,kosmasp,"Not your Self, but not less either",7,4 October 2016,"If you are into Science Fiction and like it to be entertaining too, you could be choosing something far worse indeed. Generally speaking you have an amazing cast at hand assembled, though I guess some may focus on Deadpool and Wonder Woman (plus Supermans human dad and Batmans ally in the police). Add to that Tommy Lee Jones former Batman villain and it seems like everyone has been in one comic book adaptation or another.Putting that aside though for a second, it's all about the story or basic idea of people being able to literally put ideas/thoughts into someone else head. It is predictable, which may not flow that well with some viewers. Still even as you can see where this is going (and may be screeching to some resolves), it still has the tension and especially the action to hold its own",Criminal
5,jboothmillard,Criminal,3,1 September 2019,"In The Ricky Gervais Show, Karl Pilkington described a movie pitch, with a character having another character's brain put into their head, so that they can have their memories and thoughts, this idea was hilariously ridiculous, but in fact, it came true(!), it is essentially exactly what happens in this movie, directed by Ariel Vromen (The Iceman). Basically, Jan Strook (Michael Pitt), a hacker known as ""the Dutchman"", has discovered that industrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Mollà) has created a wormhole program to bypass and access computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defence codes. CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) gets him to a safe house and gives him the money for his services. But Pope is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman. Desperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's supervisor Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) contacts Dr. Micah Franks (Tommy Lee Jones), who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memories of a dead person into a living one. They find convict Jerico Stewart, a remorseless killer with no emotional development that resulted in a childhood accident, and Franks requests that they ""graft"" Pope's knowledge into his. After the operation, Jerico escapes custody and fakes his death. He goes to Pope's house, where he holds Pope's widow Jillian ""Jill"" (Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot) hostage while he looks for the money. As time goes on, he experiences memory flashes of Pope's past, but all he can remember is the bag of money but cannot identify where it or the Dutchman are being kept. The Dutchman believes he has been betrayed by the CIA, they learn he is planning to sell the program to the Russians. Fortunately, they are able to find Jerico after he contacts Dr. Franks. Jerico is beginning to develop emotions and draw on Pope's experience. While Jerico tries to retrace Pope's steps to find the Dutchman, Heimdahl creates a distraction at the airport that draws Wells' attention, allowing Heimdahl's accomplice and lover Elsa Mueller (Antje Traue) to try and capture Jerico, killing his CIA guards before Jerico escapes by driving off a bridge. Jerico retreats to the Pope house, where he encounters Jill and explains the situation to her. She is fearful of him initially but comes to accept Jerico as she sees him bonding with her daughter, Emma (Lara Decaro), and allows him to stay the night. The next morning, after a conversation with Jill, Jerico realises that the bag is hidden at the University of London but is captured by Heimdahl and Elsa after finding it. Heimdahl threatens to kill Jill and Emma unless Jerico takes him to the Dutchman. Jerico recalls that Pope hid the Dutchman in Jillian's office at the university, but the CIA and a Russian strike team are seeking him. Jerico uses an improvised nitro-glycerine bomb to escape Elsa and returns to the Dutchman to explain the situation. Elsa finds them before they can escape, shooting Jerico in the shoulder and killing the Dutchman, but Jerico kills, bludgeoning her with a lamp. Jerico takes the flash drive containing the wormhole program to the airfield where Heimdahl is attempting an escape. Jerico is shot by Heimdahl but saves Jill and Emma. As Heimdahl's plane takes off, he programs the computer and fires a missile to strike. But Jerico reveals that the Dutchman reprogrammed it to target the next source of transmission, so Heimdahl unwittingly targets himself, and is killed in the explosion. A few months later, Jerico is shown on the beach Pope and Jillian spend their honeymoon. Wells and Franks take Jillian and Emma to see him, seeing them confirms that some part of Pope exists in Jerico, and Quaker watched and reflects that he will offer Jerico a job. Also starring Alice Eve as Marta Lynch, Scott Adkins as Pete Greensleeves, Colin Salmon as Warden and Steve Nicolson as SSBN Captain. Costner as the convicted sociopath turned anti-hero is suitably sweary and moody, Oldman overdoes his acting, Lee Jones talks science stuff, and Reynolds (who was also in Self/Less, another consciousness transplant movie) and Gadot do very little. To be completely honest, I fell asleep a few times throughout, it is both boring and bizarre, there is only a little part of you that forgets any logic and just goes with it, there are some amusing moments and explosive sequences, I can see why Mark Kermode says it is rubbish, or ""criminal"" as he put it, a disappointing action thriller. Adequate!",Criminal
6,edwagreen,**1/2,6,15 January 2017,"It's just a bit too much to fathom. After a CIA person is killed in trying to thwart a diabolical plot, a total misfit, devoid of any decent behavior, anti-societal to say the least is forced by the government to undergo a brain operation where the thoughts of the dead man are transplanted into his mind in the hopes that he can complete the mission.Kevin Costner is that man who suffers more than headaches following the surgery. Besides the surgery, which leaves his head aching, throughout the course of the film Costner, who does a very good acting job here, survives a car in the river, 3 gun-shots, numerous altercations and whatever else is thrown at him.He takes a liking to the dead agent's family, but it's just too incredible to believe all this.",Criminal

8,LeonLouisRicci,"Entertaining, Highly Emotional and Violent Sci-Fi Thriller with Heart",8,18 September 2016,"Pulp Sci-Fi Thriller that Blows Over its High-Concepts, like Memory Transfer, with Penny-a-Word Hastiness. But this Underrated Entertainment is just that, Entertaining.Forget the Egg-Head Cranks, Kick-Back and have Fun with this Star-Studded Romp that is Highly Emotional, Endearing, Violent, and an Anti-Hero worth Rooting for.

9,zardoz-13,Mind Games,8,17 April 2016,"Oscar winning film director Kevin Costner hasn't made a good action movie like ""Criminal"" since he co-starred with Kurt Russell in the eccentric Las Vegas-heist caper ""3000 Miles to Graceland"" where robbers were Elvis impersonators. ""Criminal"" washed the sour taste of dreadful epics like ""Three Days to Kill"" and ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" out of my mouth. Aside from his supporting roles in good movies like ""Man of Steel"" and his cameo in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" most of Costner's actioneers have been forgettable. Basically, he hasn't made a good movie in 16 years, at least nothing that matches his better films, including ""Message in a Bottle,"" ""13 Days,"" ""Waterworld,"" ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" ""No Way Out,"" ""The Untouchables,"" ""Silverado,"" and ""JFK."" Yes, I enjoyed ""Waterworld."" In ""Criminal,"" Costner gets a chance to shine with a performance that ranges back and forth from one end of the spectrum to the other end. Mind you, ""Criminal"" isn't going to clinch Costner an Oscar. Nevertheless, this contrived but entertaining memory swap movie is provocative enough to watch more than once. The London settings add a touch of exoticism, and the cast boasts Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Gal Gadot, and Ryan Reynolds. Clearly, Ryan Reynolds must have made this movie before ""Deadpool"" smashed global box office records. If you're a Reynolds fan, you're going to be enormously disappointed with his peripheral role. Indeed, had ""Deadpool"" not become the sensational hit that it did, Reynolds might have been reduced to minimal roles like ""Criminal."" Interestingly enough, Reynolds starred in a movie about a year ago with Ben Kingsley where he played the guy who acquired the memories from another man. ""Selfless"" was a terrific movie. Ironically, the roles are reversed for Reynolds in ""Criminal."" London-based CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds of ""The Proposal"") has stashed a cunning computer hacker, Jan Stroop, alias 'The Dutchman' (Michael Pitt of ""Seven Psychopaths""), in a safe place until he can conduct the million dollar deal that the Agency has promised Stroop. 'The Dutchman,' it seems, has pulled a ""War Games"" and has hacked through the Pentagon's firewalls so he can launch weapons of mass destruction whenever and wherever he pleases. The Agency is not alone in their pursuit of Stroop. Insane anarchist Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Mollà of ""Colombiana"") has been tracking Pope so he can find 'The Dutchman.' Heimdahl's right-hand man, actually an indestructible, trigger-happy dame, Else Mueller (Antje Traue of ""Seventh Son""), has been maintaining surveillance on Pope. She nabs Pope with Xavier's henchmen, and Xavier personally tortures Pope in the worst way possible to learn the whereabouts of 'The Dutchman.' Although he shoves a taser into Pope's mouth and singes him to death, Xavier cannot get a useful word out of him. The CIA careens onto the scene at the last moment, but Pope is kaput. What began as an Edward Snowden type thriller takes a crazy swerve into science fiction as the CIA bring in a neurosurgeon, Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones), who has been tinkering with the concept of transferring the memories from one man to another person. All this reminded me of the recent predicament that FBI found themselves in with a terrorist's iPhone. Anyway, with clinical trials years away, Franks manages to appropriate Pope's memories and transfer them intact into another man's mind. ""Criminal"" shifts gears as swiftly and abruptly and goes from probable to improbable. The CIA hopes that this new guy will be able to lead them to whenever Pope has hidden Stroop before Stroop either gives himself up to the Russians or Xavier's henchman can find him. Meantime, Stroop aims to prove to the world that he can really hack U.S. military technology with an example of his derring do.If the CIA and Western Civilization weren't in dire straits enough, the man selected by Dr. Franks for the memory transfer turns out to be a psycho afflicted with a condition known as ""frontal lobe syndrome."" Meaning, prison inmate Jerico Stewart (Kevin Costner of ""Wyatt Earp"") has no feelings one way or another and does whatever he feels when the occasion arises. Basically, he is a loose cannon without a qualm. The experiment succeeds and Jerico suffers intervals when he speaks French that he has never spoken and has access to Pope's memories. He enters the correct security codes to Pope's London apartment and questions Pope's suspicious wife Jill (Gal Gadot of ""Batman v Superman"") about a case containing millions of dollars. Originally, Pope had planned to use this money to pay off The Dutchman, but everything fell through after he died. Initially, Jerico wants the loot for himself. As the plot of this 113-minute, R-rated epic thickens, he decides to do the right thing. Incredibly, he wants to pick up where Bill Pope left off, and Pope's adorable daughter Emma (newcomer Lara Decaro) takes a shine to Jerico.The pair who penned the Sean Connery & Nicholas Cage thriller ""The Rock"" were the minds behind ""Criminal."" Scenarists Douglas Cook and David Weisberg also collaborated on the Tommy Lee Jones & Ashley Judd thriller ""Double Jeopardy"" as well as the Patricia Arquette crime comedy ""Holy Matrimony."" ""Criminal"" shares similarities with ""The Rock."" First, when we are introduced to Jerico, he is locked up in maximum security and sports shoulder-length hair, just as Connery did in ""The Rock."" Against everybody's objections, Jerico is recruited for this radical experiment. Like the Connery hero in ""The Rock,"" Jerico is a Houdini of an escape artist, but he doesn't give a crap about anybody but himself. Second, the man-in-the-middle of ""Criminal"" is as amoral as Ed Harris was in ""The Rock."" The Harris character threatened to launch missiles, and 'The Dutchman' is prepared to wield the Pentagon's doomsday arsenal against it. Essentially, the similarities end here. Of course, ""Criminal"" is incredibly far-fetched, especially its happily ever after finale, but ""Iceman"" director Ariel Vromen never lets the pace slacken and stages several exciting action scenes.",Criminal
10,oscaralbert,"Just because Kevin Costner's ""Jericho"" was thrown . . .",7,20 April 2016,". . . out of a speeding car's window when he was a toddler, destroying the frontal lobes of his brain, is no reason NOT to keep him chained up 24/7, the makers of CRIMINAL illustrate here. Even with a partial brain transplant from Ryan Reynolds, the Canadian gray matter is not enough to prevent Jericho from wiping out half of America's CIA agents in London, as well as a large number of British Highway Patrol officers, not to mention a few random bystanders. Jericho also blows up the Chemistry Building at Oxford University, and trashes the George Orwell section of that school's Rare Books Collection. CRIMINAL makes the argument that the government must permanently lock up the kids of Flint, MI, immediately to protect Society from the violent behavior experts forecast is sure to result from their recent Lead Poisoning. You can shoot Michigan Governor Rick Snyder for High Treason because of this Intentional Poisoning of the Democratic Base if you want to, but ALL of these kids are now ticking time bombs just as much as Jericho is in CRIMINAL. Simply because these kids caught a bad break doesn't erase their future violent tendencies. The entire American population was kept safe from Jericho, and it must be safeguarded against the brain-damaged Flintstones, as well--no matter how evil their governor was for poisoning them.",Criminal
11,george.schmidt,Wily and canny Costner has a field day in this hokey sci-fi actioner,7,26 April 2016,"CRIMINAL (2016) **1/2 Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds, Jordi Molla, Gal Gadot, Michael Pitt, Amaury Nolasco, Alice Eve, Lara Decaro. Over-the-top sci-fi auctioneer with Costner having a field day as a brutal death row-inmate fitted to task by having a killed CIA op's thoughts implanted in order to stop a worldwide cyber threat with the usual drawbacks.

While the overcooked script by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg is all over the map, co-stars Oldman overacting and Jones underplaying-borderline-bored, director Vromen wisely allows his veteran lead to grouse and gruffly grunt his way thru the hokey plot with aplomb and some surprisingly canny motivations including Gadot as the shapely widow and adorable Decaro as the slain agent's daughter.",Criminal
12,neil-476,"Quite good, could have been better",7,22 April 2016,"After CIA operative Bill Pope is killed while still in possession of essential information, he is subjected to an experimental procedure wherein his memories are copied across to the partially unused brain of amoral jailbird Jericho. This puts Jericho and Pope's wife and daughter in a great deal of danger.Dressed up with a little bit of science fiction, this action thriller concentrates on Jericho's journey as Pope's personality and inherent morality begins to imprint itself over Jericho's nihilism. Kevin Costner, as Jericho, has more fun with this part than with any since Silverado, to start off with at any rate. By the end, Jericho's gleeful and unrestrained violence has been replaced with a rather more subdued persona, much closer to what we are used to seeing Costner playing. Ryan Reynolds as Pope is hardly in it, but Gal Gadot impresses as his widow: not only does she look good, she can act, and she makes sense of the odd relationship between the widow and the man on whom her late husband is partially imprinted. Gary Oldman as Pope's boss delivers an hysterical performance of a badly written character.While I quite enjoyed this, I felt almost all the way through that it could have been quite a lot better, although I can't quite put my finger on why.",Criminal
13,anaconda-40658,Criminal in More Ways Than One.,7,20 April 2016,"Criminal (2016): Dir: Ariel Vromen / Cast: Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds: Title seems to symbolize both the anti-hero Jericho Stewart, a convict chosen for a brain operation that fuses a living brain into his own to locate information from the mind of a deceased agent. The title can also reference the operation itself and the head trauma and agony that it leaves Stewart in. He is played by Kevin Costner who escapes custody but keeps seeing images of the agent's mind, which eventually leads him to his family. Tommy Lee Jones plays the surgeon who has second thoughts about the procedure and dislike for the whole treatment. He does give Stewart medicine to calm the pain. Gary Oldman is unfortunately flat as the agent heading this operation that killed one of his men in the film's opening. This is where the film presents an idea that director Alfred Hitchcock employed in Psycho as we have the high profile actor Ryan Reynolds as an agent whose presence is compromised and he is on the run. He sends one last call to his wife and daughter before fate closers in. Gal Gadot plays his wife whose first encounter with Stewart has her tied to a bed. Eventually she comes to realize what is happening. Her husband's brain is fighting through Stewart's. This is all very complex and sometimes complicated but director Ariel Vromen has fun with the action violence that often goes over the top and pointless. The ending is questionable at best but it draws focus on legalities and liberties as well as the good of one's mind influencing the human frame of a villain. Score: 7 ½ / 10",Criminal
14,FlashCallahan,It's the official J.F.K 25 year reunion......,8,24 April 2016,"It's really refreshing to see an actor play against type for a role. To see one of the biggest stars of the nineties play an abhorrent piece of work for the most part of the film certainly brings something refreshing to a hackneyed old terrorist wants a computer hard drive for world domination trope that has been around longer than the star himself...Sociopathic death-row inmate Jerico Stewart is implanted with the memories of a deceased CIA agent, in a desperate attempt to thwart a deadly plot involving a Dutch hacker, known as......wait for it......The Dutchman.At the same time, Jerico reconnects with his own humanity as he bonds with the late agent's family......The film, in my opinion, has been unfairly dismissed by critics and thus has been avoided by audiences, because when you think about it, if the film had been made 22 years ago, and starred the majority of the same cast, it would have been one of the biggest films of the year, and I believe it would have been well received.Costner here is wonderfully over the top, sneering and causing havoc with whatever he does, he goes to get a coffee and breaks someones nose, and in the funniest scene of the film, where he goes to get a kebab, and somebody literally says to him 'that's bang out of order' (the makers are as subtle as a sledgehammer the way they portray the locals).Costner may have portrayed a bad guy in 3000 Miles To Graceland, but here, he's pretty much channelling his character from A Perfect World, except to craziness is turned up to 11.Oldman is in it just to shout and swear a lot, and although he's a great screen presence, he's wasted in this. As is Jones, Eve, Adkins, and Gadot.Reynolds has a wonderful cameo at the beginning of the film, and to be fair, it's the best mind swap film he's ever been in (two and counting).Add some much needed humour, to sweeten the clichés and the predictable narrative, Criminal is a fun film, with decent action, disregard for the British emergency services, and if you look at it another way, one of the strangest DC/Marvel universe mash ups you could ever wish for.Two Face puts Deadpools mind into Jonathan Kent, Kent gets told off by commissioner Gordon a lot, and proceeds to stalk Wonder Woman.Now thats a fun film, much like this one",Criminal

16,gradyharp,'You hurt me... I hurt you worse',8,29 July 2016,"Mixing medical technology with espionage may not be a novel idea but in the hands of writers Douglas Cook and David Weisberg and director Ariel Vromen the marriage produces a nonstop action film that ranks up there with the best of them to appeal to the audience need for grit. The very solid cast makes it happen and keeps our attention from square one. Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA agent on a mission in London tracking down a shadowy hacker nicknamed ""The Dutchman"" (Michael Pitt). When he gets mysteriously ambushed and killed, an experimental procedure performed by Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones) is used to transfer his memories into dangerous ex-convict Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner). When he wakes up with the CIA agent's memories, Jericho's mission is to find The Dutchman and eliminate him before the hacker launches ICBM's and starts World War III. But complications soon arise and the mission turns personal. Gary Oldman plays Quaker Wells, the man obsessed by his own manipulations to save the world from the enemy – including a mastermind Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Mollà) – with the help of Jill Pope (Bill's widow) played by newcomer Gal Gadot, and Marta Lynch (Alice Eve) et al. This is a noisy but very fast paced action film with a brain – the script makes sense (memory transplantation as a means of saving the experience of a deceased CIA operative). One of the aspects of the memory transplantation is the fact that it gives the 'man without feeling' Jericho the ability to feel and love – and that saves the film.",Criminal

The idea is a bit too hard to believe, but luckily, the narrative doesn't lose steam & remains engaging for the most part. And the Ensemble Cast Delivers! 'Criminal' Synopsis: In a last-ditch effort to stop a diabolical plot, a dead CIA operative's memories, secrets, and skills are implanted into a death-row inmate in hopes that he will complete the operative's mission.'Criminal' is racy, violent & ridiculous. I mean, planting a person's memories into another person is a silly thought. But, this is Escapist Cinema & hence what matters here, is how engaged you are amidst the madness. Jericho, the protagonist (played by Kevin Costner in a comeback performance), is an unlikely guy, but its interesting to watch him fight between memories as well as fight the villains behind him. I liked the protagonist & hence the goings-on were thoroughly watchable.Douglas Cook & David Weisberg's Screenplay is entirely escapist, but its arresting, at most parts. Ariel Vromen's Direction is good. Cinematography is passable. Editing is mostly crisp, although the film overstays its welcome by, at least, 15-minutes. A shorter running time would've worked more. Action-Sequences are raw & brutal. Background Score merits a special mention. Performance-Wise: Kevin Costner is in form after a long time. As Jericho, Costner is at his deadliest & also his toughest, enacting the unlikely hero with command. Gal Gadot is wonderful. Gary Oldman is loud, but delivers. Tommy Lee Jones is effective, as always. Jordi Mollà is excellent as the antagonist. Ryan Reynolds adds star-value in a tiny cameo. On the whole, 'Criminal' works for the most part.",Criminal

20,KineticSeoul,Tries to be cool and interesting but fails miserably,3,5 August 2016,"This is a movie that tries to emulate other movies that the director of this film thinks is cool. Films such as ""Face/Off"", ""Inception"" and few other films. It's okay for directors to try and emulate other films if it works, but it just didn't work for this movie. It sort of reminded me of a reversed version of the movie ""Self/Less"" except ""Self/Less"" is a more entertaining movie and more engaging...At least compared to this movie. I could see what the director tried to do, but there isn't any thing here to really get the audiences to get attached to the characters. It was trying to be a film where the audiences really gets attached the the leads and enjoy the journey the protagonist takes while building interest. It falters because there is nothing really interesting about the characters or the story and despite it trying to look cool with it's musical notes and how people are dressed and how things look. The whole experience felt bland with nothing new going on. Plus most of the talented cast didn't even seem to be trying, and just had the expression like ""why am I even in this thing, I gotta do something to get that paycheck regardless"". So yeah, even the cast looked disinterested. Overall, I just have to give a pass on this movie the whole thing was a badly edited snooze fest that tries so hard to be cool but just isn't. 3.5/10",Criminal
21,Hellmant,The film does showcase Costner's talents well!,8,4 May 2016,"'CRIMINAL': Four Stars (Out of Five)Action-thriller flick, starring Kevin Costner as a dangerous convict; implanted with a dead CIA agent's memories, in order to finish an important mission. The film costars an impressive all-star cast; including Gal Gadot, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Jordi Molla, Antje Traue, Alice Eve, Michael Pitt, Scott Adkins and Ryan Reynolds (in a special extended cameo). The film was directed by Ariel Vromen, and written by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg (the duo also co-wrote 'THE ROCK' and 'DOUBLE JEOPARDY'). It received mostly negative reviews from critics, but I enjoyed it.Xavier Heimdahl (Molla) is a rich, and extremely dangerous, anarchist; that hires a computer hacker, known as 'The Dutchman' (Pitt), to make him a device which will bypass all nuclear defense codes. The Dutchman panics though, and tries to turn the program over to the CIA. Agent Bill Pope (Reynolds) is sent to retrieve the device, but he's caught and killed; before he can do so. Due to the fact that Pope is the only person that knows The Dutchman's whereabouts, the CIA is desperate to try a special new experiment; which will transfer Pope's memories to another person. The doctor performing the procedure, Dr. Mahal Franks (Jones), recommends convict Jericho Stewart (Costner); due to the fact he has an underdeveloped frontal lobe, from childhood brain trauma. He's also a violent, and very dangerous, criminal; due to this fact! The movie is without a doubt entertaining, but in a cheesy B-movie kind of way. Despite it being poorly written, and almost completely unbelievable, the film does showcase Costner's talents well; he's fantastic in it. The rest of the cast is impressive, but it seems like they're all just there to support Costner. The guy used to be the most popular actor in Hollywood (in the 90s) for a reason, and this movie definitely shows why!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuGIEoCGrtw",Criminal

But, those are just films the actors played in. This screenplay, however, has made appearances itself in such movies as: The Bourne franchise, Payback, Face/Off, Source Code and The Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, this extremely dark, depressing and gritty film has none of the charm it ""borrowed"" from.This experience isn't a pleasant one, but it does have a better second half than first. Basically, to catch two sets of bad guys – one, a hacker, à la Edward Snowden and the other: a terrorist – they need a third bad guy, the worst of them all. And, like the aforementioned Suicide Squad, they manufacture the (insert movie title here) with the brain of an agent to save the world.Sounds convoluted? Well it is, but it all evens itself out to be a somewhat decent climax. Nothing's plausible and I'm not just referring to the rushed sci-fi aspect. Overall recommended? Eh. Not really. It's just too down and too long to get to the point. But, I guess for a leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature, it works. Barely.***Final thoughts: Kevin Costner rarely makes a bad bad guy. But, if you want this role of his multiplied by a hundred, watch the little known and phenomenal Mr. Brooks. In fact, if you started this movie, stop it, or leave the theatre (like it's still playing) and go get Mr. Brooks. Much, much better.",Criminal

24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Increasingly nonsensical action thriller,4,11 December 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning CIA operative Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is killed in the line of duty while on a mission in London. In order to posthumously complete his mission, Commander Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) decides to implant his memories into sociopathic killer Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner), in a procedure carried out by Dr Franks (Tommy Lee Jones.) Needless to say, things don't go to plan, and when Stewart goes off the rails, it becomes a race against time to catch him, and stop the twisted Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Molla) from executing his diabolical plan, while his protégé 'The Dutchman' (Michael Pitt) tries to usurp him.The Iceman director Ariel Vromen has, with Criminal, his second feature length film, assembled an all star cast of older, past their prime former stars, whilst quickly dispatching current box office golden boy Ryan Reynolds, whom you are left to wonder was paid how much for making such a brief appearance. But the most perplexing thing about the film is how such a seasoned cast could come together and combine their talents for something so flimsy and throwaway, a connect the dots effort that becomes increasingly more nonsensical and crazy the more it goes on.Out of all these 80s/90s throwbacks on display, in the lead role it's Costner, on whose shoulders the biggest weight falls, and he does pretty well, portraying a truly nasty piece of work with no sense of empathy or how to conduct himself, but in supporting roles the rest of the cast are left to fritter meaninglessly away with no real substance. As the film drags on, it starts to defy the laws of logic and plausibility in such a way you can't really take it seriously any more, especially with how far fetched it all seems.It sets its sights really high, but in the end, the best thing about it is the novelty value of seeing Costner enter a kebab shop or Jones riding down a quaint residential English street. **",Criminal
25,MOscarbradley,Surprisingly entertaining if a tad on the violent side,7,6 August 2017,"A cross between a sci-fi movie and a convoluted CIA thriller, ""Criminal"" is neither fish nor fowl but a better than average cast, (Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Michael Pitt and an underused Ryan Reynolds), and some first-rate action sequences do go some way towards making up for the huge lapses in credibility; some way, but not enough to make this feel like something out of the Jason Bourne franchise. It's also a bit of a stretch to accept Costner, now 62, as a no-holds-barred action hero even if his over-the-top, cast-against-type performance is hugely entertaining. Also on the plus side, director Ariel Vromen makes excellent use of his London locations though to be fair, this could have been filmed anywhere. It's certainly watchable and Douglas Cook and David Weisberg's script does play on the comic potentials of the situation, though you get the impression that Oldman, Jones and especially Reynolds are only in it for the money.",Criminal
26,dromasca,quite a good B-movie,6,28 September 2020,"'Criminal', Ariel Vromen's 2016 film is an interesting combination that, depending on the expectations and the mood of the viewers, can disappoint or be a pleasant surprise. It is a spy film based on a science-fiction idea that is not developed in depth, a rather violent action film that fits the B-Movie label. The cast brings together on screen a collection of well-known actors with fame in Hollywood or in the UK. All do their jobs in an exemplary manner, but the exclamation 'what a waste of talent!' was probably heard many times at the exit of the screening halls. The story is quite interesting, but the rules of films of this genre do not allow or allow time to add too much substance to the psychological profiles of the characters. The film, being well acted and impeccably made technically, manages to arouse and keep the interest of most viewers, but I failed to avoid a dose of regret for an artistic potential, less commercial but more interesting, which seemed insufficiently exploited .'Criminal' begins as an espionage action movie, with a by-the-book chase on the streets of London ending in the violent death of a CIA agent. Here starts the element of science fiction, as his memory is transplanted through an experimental process into the brain of Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner), a murderer sentenced to life in prison, the kind of Hannibal Lecter. If the pretext seems thin, you can console yourself by learning that scientific experiences with the transfer of the memory of the dead and are quite advanced, although the transfer is made on other physical media than living persons brains. Returning to the film, the stakes of the procedure are not only a suitcase with a large sum of money, but also access to nuclear activation codes. In a short time, the inmate will be free on the streets of London, pursued by espionage agencies and criminal organizations, and in addition to full doubling of personality, with his criminal instincts overlapping the memories and feelings of the dead agent.The formula works very well and the result is one of the B-movies that I was not at all sorry to see. Ariel Vromen shoots professionally, and the script follows all the rules of action movies. Kevin Costner has the opportunity to be cast in a complex and interesting role. He is an actor who in my opinion has received undeserved criticism, and perhaps this role is the beginning of a come-back, he succeeds well excepting slight exaggerations of physical pain. Tommy Lee Jones as the doctor who invented and leads the memory transfer and Gal Gadot as the wife of the murdered agent manage to make their roles credible and even memorable characters, with the little material at hand. I can't say the same about Gary Oldman, the only one who deserves the 'wasted acting talent' cliché. Could this movie have said more? I believe so, the reason being that the doubling of the personality as a result of the memory transfer could have been written differently and developed in more depth. But this would probably have happened at the expense of the action part, and then the fans of the genre to which the film is targeted would have complained. I hope that at least these would be satisfied.",Criminal
27,ThomasDrufke,Awkward,5,15 April 2016,"Even with the efforts of its top notch cast, Criminal never really leaps off the screen to give us anything of substance. It may please some genre fans with its cool premise, but they'll likely be left with a film of no real substance or personality.Kevin Costner stars as Jericho Stewart, a death-row inmate who is forced to undergo a surgery to recover the memories of Bill Pope, played by Ryan Reynolds, a CIA agent with important and dangerous information regarding a mission. Even though Reynolds is barely in the film at all, I can't help but feel like this idea is utterly similar to his 2015 film, Self/less. But Reynolds isn't the problem here. In fact, the opening 10 minutes in which is largely focused on him, were quite compelling. The opening of the film feels like an entry in the Bourne franchise with its espionage, chases, and thrill sequences. Sadly, the rest of the film never reaches the heights of its opening.Being a criminal, as the title clearly states, it becomes hard for the audience to root for Jericho. Glimpses of his humanity underneath are only shown here or there. As Jericho becomes more and more like Pope, he draws his attention to Pope's family, and there lies several awkward scenes. Gal Gadot provides a solid performance as Pope's wife, but I felt no chemistry at all between her and Costner. Awkward is really the best way to describe it.Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones have some screen time and they are great as always, but again, I was never invested at what was going on to these characters. The script/directing never pulled me in to care about the consequences and what's at stake. The villain, known as the 'Spanish Anarchist' is over-the-top, and there's plenty of gratuitous violence that doesn't fit in with the story they were trying to tell. Overall, the best way I can describe the feeling I had watching this film was awkward.+Good effort from the cast-Wasn't invested in the characters-Gratuitous violence5.7/10",Criminal

29,lesleyharris30,"An Intriguing Story that does not Always Deliver,",7,26 June 2017,"Criminal is a good movie with a well developed plot and a stellar cast. It's a really interesting story that is almost immediately grabbing as you will find yourself curious as to what will happen next. The all star cast is phenomenal, particularly Kevin Costner in one of his best roles in years. He delivers a very believable, dedicated performance that had me from start to finish. It can be quite cheesy at times, which would be the biggest reason as to why it falls flat. There is a lot of one on one dialogue, particularly between Costner and Gal Gadot, that is clear that the writers went over it once and just left it as it was, never looking back over and trying to make it more real, less cringe inducing. It is also very slow moving. Running at about twenty minutes longer than is necessary, what starts off as a very intriguing plot goes on to become tedious, as it lingers on a lot of plot points and gives more development than we as an audience really wanted. It's entertaining, but in no way groundbreaking. A great cast and thrilling moments, Criminal is riddled with flaws, but it is worth the watch if you are looking for a good crime drama, just do not go out of your way to see it. A murdered operative's memory is implanted in to a criminal in hopes that he will complete his mission. Best Performance: Gary Oldman",Criminal

Also fun to see Adkins in a purely supporting role that does not involve him breaking buildings with his elbows.Second, any movie that literally kills off Ryan Reynolds in the first five minutes you know is going to be .... interesting.Well, to skip ahead to the verdict, this movie is strangely fun and engrossing in spite of its many plot holes and script errors.What plot holes you ask? Well, not to give too much away (because I am recommending the movie) you need to remember that the entire story is about an attempt to save the world by ""transplanting"" memories from a dead man to a live one, that this is done for the first time on a human, and that time is of the essence.OK, with that firmly in mind, you will watch the movie and notice that, in spite of the above, on NOT ONE BUT TWO OCCASIONS the character played by Oldman decides the whole thing is simply not working and essentially throws Costner's character away the way a fisherman throws a fish back into the ocean.Following which mayhem ensues and he regrets it.Yes this is indeed a plot device to move things along (in real life people are not that stupid) but the writers use the device not once but TWICE. By the second time, the viewer is going whhaaaa ... didn't we learn anything from the last time???

This is not a masterpiece and isn't in my top 5 Costner movies but this is very entertaining, fast paced and one that I could watch a few times I think.

34,tabuno,A Very Involving Espionage/Sci Fi Thriller,9,13 January 2019,"19 April 2016. I assume it's important to emphasize the science fiction element in this spy thriller. One of the criticisms propelled against this movie is that it requires a huge suspension of belief regarding brain memory transfer. Well considering today's quantum computers, nanotechnology, and all sorts of science gizmos whizzing about, it's not hard for me to pretend that in five years the possibility of some pretty fantastic technologies coming about. The memory transfer stretch made me only appreciate how it made the story plot well realized.Spoiler Alert: Following in the footsteps of Kurt Russell's Snake Plissken's character from Escape from New York (1981), with themes from Cliff Robertson's Charly Gordon in Charly (1968), and Arnold Schwarzenegger bipolar role in Total Recall (1990), Kevin Costner has been offered this delicious role that his whole temperament and film character persona has been evolving towards over the decades. Finally taking movie elements of hard edged espionage films as The Bourne Identity (2002), Bourne Supremacy (2004), and Bourne Ultimatum (2007) as well as Enemy of the State (1998) and even Kevin Costner's own recent spy thriller 3 Days to Kill (2014) or his cold psychological thriller Mr. Brooks (2007), Criminal offers up an intense and captivating action thriller.What makes this movie special is its focus more on thoughtful intrigue rather than just big explosions and action scenes. This movie's action scenes are more focused on the raw, personal violence of one man brutalizing another, so much so, that this movie almost becomes politically incorrect and not exactly sympathy inducing. Even so, it seems that female audience members preferred this movie over the male audience movies, suggesting there is an underlying emotive component that really weeps through the digital screen. Criminal was the movie that Kevin Costner was born to play and he did it magnificently. Even though admittedly there were a few logical flaws aside from the science fiction in regards to expected espionage techniques and the tendency for the movie to be more predictable than average, these weakness pale when considering how bold and rough this movie impacted the emotions and senses.",Criminal
35,Reno-Rangan,A man with the two minds!,6,4 September 2016,"This is a very familiar theme, but a different format and gives a different scientific excuse to execute the story. It is kind of 'Face/off' and 'Self/less' meets the 'Hardcore Henry'. It has some decent stunt sequences, but most of the film was just running and chasing around. And then there's a youngster whose involvement was the centre of the narration.It all begins when an American secret agent was killed before completing his mission in the London. The important data from his brain were transmitted to a prison serving convict and then after the surgery he goes loose. So the man hunt begins against the running out of the time where the original mission needs to be accomplished. How the rest of the story shapes up were a fast paced action-thriller.Something I don't like in the todays films are the open ending keeping in mind a sequel. This was an average box office film, but they might make another film. Wonderful cast, though. There are too many big names and everybody did the brief roles, except Kevin Costner in the main character, a tough one. But I did not know it was his film till I watch. In the poster he looked like somebody else. Though he did well along with the others, particularly Gal Gadot who I saw recently as Wonder Woman and now as an ordinary wife. A swift pace, but the story was nothing, overly depended on the star value as well as the stunts and the technical quality.

The main concept is not enough to sink Criminal. But throw in an incompetent CIA station chief (Gary Oldman); a series of CIA operatives who do irrational activity,getting many of them killed; a truly unbelievable and often idiotic villain (Jordi Molla).The film has a decent concept but feels underdeveloped and when we reach the end, it feels as it they could have done a lot more. Some parts were entertaining and intriguing but thinking of the film as a whole, it was not too great and somewhat messy and confusing. Low expectations were what was had, and it fell through. The ending was too predictable in a whole. Pretty blatant that was how it was going to end. This is a film which could have used some unexpected twists and turns, it surely would have made the film better.

38,leonblackwood,Original and quite enjoyable! 7/10,7,2 October 2016,"Review: I really enjoyed this movie! The strange thing, is that most of the cast has starred in superhero movies throughout the years. You have Gal Gadot (Jill Pope) playing Wonderwoman, Ryan Reynolds (Bill Pope) playing Deadpool or the Green Lantern, Kevin Costner (Jericho Stewart) as Supermans dad, Jonathan Kent, Gary Oldman (Quaker Wells) as Commissioner Gordon in the Batman movies, Tommy Lee Jones (Dr. Franks) as Colonel Chester Philips in Captain America and Two-Face/Harvey Dent in Batman Forever, Jordi Molla (Xavier) as Castillo in Ant-Man and Amaury Nolasco (Esteban Ruiza) as Jack Lupine in Max Payne. They must all have the same agent! Anyway, at the beginning of this film, I was feeling a Total Recall vibe, and I can understand why Ryan Reynolds didn't play the lead, because he recently starred in Self/Less, which had that same, kind of concept but once all the brain enhancements are out the way, I actually enjoyed watching Kevin Costner playing a psychopath with a conscious. The director gave Jericho's terrible behaviour a meaning by giving an in depth explanation about his, somewhat unusual brain, which gave the movie some depth, and when they tweaked his brain, the whole terrorist element of the film was well put together. Gary Oldman was great as Quaker, mainly because of the intensity throughout the film but I didn't quite get the beach scene at the end. I must admit, I was rooting for the Jericho side of Costner, because his outrageous behaviour did make me laugh, so there really is something for everyone in this film. Personally, I hope they make a sequel! Enjoyable!Round-Up: Although the movie didn't smash the box office, you can definitely see were every bit of the budget went, and I can just imagine how much the actors wages must have cost. I honestly think that it deserved a bigger profit for its originality and great performances, especially from Kevin Costner who was acting out of his comfort zone, so I hope that people will give it a chance, now that it's released on DVD. Anyway, the movie was directed by, Israeli born, Ariel Vromen, 43, who also brought you Simple Lies in 2005, Danika and the Iceman starring Michael Shannon, Chris Evans & James Franco. He hasn't had a lot of experience in the movie world but everyone was quite impressed with the Iceman when it was released and when people look back at this movie, I'm sure that they will think that it was a decent achievement for a person who hasn't directed many movies. Budget: $31.5million Worldwide Gross: $36millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/dramas, starring Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds, Jordi Molla, Gal Gadot, Michael Pitt, Alice Eve and Amaury Nolasco. 7/10",Criminal

I had seen it a number of times on my watchlist and had mistaken the star of the film for being Aaron Paul. Even now, knowing that it is Kevin Costner, it looks more like Paul to me. It wasn't until about halfway through the movie that I clicked and asked myself when the hell Aaron Paul was going to show up. That story to me is more interesting than anything the film could come up with. Man oh man was this bland. The acting was bland, the action was dull and the story was as forgettable as you will ever come across.There's actually a great cast assembled for 'Criminal' however none of them are given anything interesting to say or do. Ryan Reynolds even makes a brief appearance near the beginning of the film, however in hindsight I probably would've preferred he wasn't there at all, because the cameo only left me wanting more from him.

Kevin goes back and forth between having no feelings and not caring between right and wrong to remembering Gal and other key bits of information.

His only ally is Dr Franks (Tommy Lee), but that list gets larger as we go on.Somewhere in here is Danny Webb, the only survivor of ""Alien 3"", the British backdrop of this film gives us interesting actors from that area as local denizens.It took me a few weeks to get to this film, at first it did not look like something I'd like. But it has a lot of good things, Science Fiction, Spies, and good Buttkickings. And Gary is always great in Spy movies. This is the second film in which I have seen Gal Godot, and she's a wonder woman here as well.The premise here, is that Reynold's character was after a hacker who had a program that could do some damaging things. So we have the elements of an IT Thriller as well.But what pleases me is that Costner is not finished acting, not by a long shot. And this role is something a lot different, it is the anti-hero. Something which Tom Cruise tried in ""Edge of Tomorrow"".",Criminal
42,sauravjoshi85,A big disappointment!!!!,2,29 August 2020,"The Criminal is an action thriller movie directed by Ariel Vromen and stars Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Jordi Mollà, Gal Gadot and Michael Pitt.An interesting plot, an impressive star cast and a disheartening mess is the short review of the movie. The movie is one of the most forgettable movie I've ever seen. Despite of some of the great talent of Hollywood the movie is real trash.Acting is a major disappointment despite of having stars like Costner, Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Costner is suffering from headache in major part of the movie due to brain surgery which resulted in mine headache, Oldman was running like a headless chicken in the whole movie and I felt that I should also run leaving the movie midway. Tommy Lee Jones was also wasted, other cast was equally disappointed. Screenplay is bad and gets slow, direction is bad and the climax doesn't impresses much.My humble suggestion would be to watch the movie without having any sort of expectation and off course without using your brain.",Criminal

45,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Like a portal to 90's ea action cinema,6,10 June 2017,"Ariel Vroman's Criminal does its best to pay homage to beloved pseudo science fiction genre films of the nineties like Face/Off or Eraser, and for the most part it succeeds. All the elements are in place: padded, eclectic cast, implausibly sketchy high concept brain tampering, slick anti-terrorist war games, a brash arch-villain and adorably clunky emotional interludes. When a deep cover agent (Ryan Reynolds, weirdly uncredited) is killed in London, his FBI handler (Gary Oldman), has a tantrum at the lost secrets he knew and commissions Dr. Tommy Lee Jones to use sketchy cutting edge science and transfer Reynold's memories into another man's cerebrum. Of course they choose some violent, irreparably damaged convict, namely Jericho Stuart, played with growling, feral panache by Kevin Costner. ""You hurt me, I hurt you back worse"", is this deeply sociopathic dude's mantra, and it's expectedly hilarious that the bureau shoots themselves in the foot by picking such a wild card for the program, but there you have it. With new memories, Jericho's basic primal instinct is diluted with emotional scar tissue from Reynolds, haunted by his former wife (Gal Gadot, terrific), as well as a host of clandestine secrets from Ryan's noggin that propel him on a globetrotting (well, London trotting, really) excursion to bring down a radical cyber criminal (Jordi Molla, the Spanish Gary Oldman, coincidentally sharing the screen with his counterpart). This is the Kevin Costner show all the way, it's really the best work I've seen from him in years. He would have been way better taking the antagonist route with his career, as showcased here. Jericho is a bitter, psychotic outsider and Kevin plays it up royally, dishing out bone smashing beatdowns on random pedestrians and calling anyone he sees a 'fu#%ker'. Oldman yells at everything, and I mean everything. It's like there were cue notes next to his lines that said 'just scream your lines the whole way through', but he's fun too, that early career intensity showing through his weathered gaze. Michael Pitt also shows up with a hysterical Dutch accent, doing the boy with the dragon tattoo hacker shtick, looking pale and sullen. The cloak and dagger stuff is uproariously silly, as it should be, the emotional core appropriately sappy too. Smart move in keeping the hard R action movie alive, unlike some movies we know (I'm casting a disgusted look over at Expendable 3), and indeed Kevin gets some overly bloody kills in that fulfill the carnage quota and then some. He kicks ass, Oldman hollers, Reynolds cameos, Gadot cries, Jones looks weary, and so it goes. Not a total slam dunk, but it will make you feel nostalgic for those good old Sly/Armie/Van Damme blitzkriegs of yore.",Criminal
46,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"tense, taut, thrilling action flick that got the wrong end of the stick",8,1 April 2019,"Well, it took Wonder Woman to get me to order this, and I got this considered-to-be a loser dirt cheap. I had downloaded a scene on good old Tubidy, it was the bound scene, and I instantly developed the theory that long-legged Wonder Woman was casted right here in the minds of the 2017 version's producers. Thus a collector's item, from my agog-by-the-actresses viewpoint. And I was relieved to seethat the Gal Gadot character survived, hell, from that snippet alone, anything might have happened. Decided to plunk down for it, and, gee, for once not much was needed, a mere pittance. Of course I didn't expect much, for the general gist of the reviews on IMDb I popped up were sneering at the movie's existence.Sure enough, at first, I really didn't go for it - just a heavy thug movie. The action sequences soon prove it to be above average. But it is the human element that really lifts it up. Initially, I loathed Jericho, but his interaction with the little girl instantly won me over a bit more than halfway through.To those criticising, I honestly can't see what you're bickering about Perhaps you only watched ten, twenty minutes here and there or so? Anyway, there is more than enough blood and gore to satisfy every jaded genre aficionado, so that can't be the problem. Plus my personal favourite, all those jumping police cars...Early on, I did notice two things:(1) Kevin Costner's eyes in the jail cell, when he is still Jericho at his animal worst. Soft, refined, like some rich old former heartthrob dude trying to make a comeback. Too soft. Do over, l'd have said.(2) Gal Gadot in the bound scene. Come on, honey, you're giggling behind the gag! Dammit, had I been the director, I would have been jumping up and down, Not that way! Not that way!But it is only in that scene that I criticise her.

47,TdSmth5,Far more emotional than it needs to be,6,12 September 2016,"Some CIA guy is in London, he picks up a bag full of money but someone is watching and tailing him. He manages to escape in a cab. The CIA station gives him a location where a ""laundry team"" will wipe out the bad guys. But a hacker is also watching him and changes the coordinates on the GPS sending him right in his arms. He wants to know where ""the Dutchman"" is. The agent doesn't talk, is tortured and killed. Special Forces arrive too late.Then the CIA grabs some researcher. They want him to perform his experiments on memory for the first time on living persons. They are keeping the dead CIA agent's brain alive so the researcher can transfer his memories to someone else. That someone else will turned out to be a seasoned criminal with an underdeveloped frontal lobe as a result of which he experiences no feelings.The procedure sort of works. The criminal named Jericho has occasionally flashbacks of the agent's life. The agent had a deal to buy the Dutchman's work instead of killing him which is what the CIA wanted to do. When Jericho ""remembers"" the bag of cash he decides to not cooperate. The CIA is also after the Dutchman but since Jericho doesn't remember they decide to get rid of him but he's a badass and kills the CIA guys who were going to kill him and escapes. He visits the agent's home, ""meets"" the daughter and wife. And tries to figure out where the money is.The Dutchman is hiding somewhere. He developed a wormhole in the dark web which somehow gave him complete control of America's weapons arsenal. The Spanish hacker with the very Spanish name Heimdahl who is also an anarchist wants that access so he can topple all governments. He's got a badass chick on the ground doing his dirty work. He too is monitoring Jericho.So now Jericho has to find the money and evade capture or death by ""Heimdahl"" and the CIA which acts in London as it pleases. Of course the guy with no feelings will develop feelings to the agent's family, and they for him for some reason. Of course of wife and daughter will get themselves captured and he will have to rescue them, too.Criminal starts out good enough. There's an unnecessary intro scene. But too early on the bizarre memory-transfer hocus pocus surfaces which took the credibility of the movie down by a couple of notches. But alright. Then it has to make the guy get all romantic and the family somehow just accepts this guy, too. Kostner does a good job and is occasionally funny but they have him grunting a bit too much. Oldman seems to be stuck in these roles where he's always running after someone, arrives late, then screams orders at nondescript characters. Scott Adkins is in there too, but doesn't get to kick butt at all. What a waste. Lara Decaro is adorable. It could have been a good thriller had they trimmed it by 20 minutes and go easy on the emotional stuff.",Criminal
48,s3276169,Formulaic......,3,3 May 2016,"Criminal is yet another formulaic, unimaginative, espionage orientated action flick, with status quo, affirming overtones.

Once again, as is the current ""trend"", the Russians are the bad guys pals, aiding and abetting, the terrorists. Sorry but the cold wars over and guess what, if people are anything like me, they are not buying into the ersatz ""re-run"". Simply put, Criminal, comes across as a yet another ""beige"" production line affair. A situation made worse by rather bland performances from the actors and a storyline that meanders around aimlessly, like the key character, played by Kevin Costner.Are there any positives here, I hear you ask? Well, there's some action scenes that are not too awful and the acting, whilst uninspiring, is not dreadful.There's not a lot more to say really. I have seen Kevin Costner in at least one decent spy action thriller but this is, most definitely, not it.Three out of ten from me.",Criminal
49,peterp-450-298716,Costner playing a bad-ass who kicks ass unabashedly. Nice !,6,13 February 2017,"""I don't remember anything, asshole. You're confusing me with someone else.""Jerico Stewart (Kevin Costner) is a danger to society. He's locked up in a maximum-security prison as a chained wild beast. An unruly person without feelings. A psychopathic person who doesn't even know the difference between right and wrong (""You can't punish someone who doesn't know he did something wrong""). And this thanks to his mother's friend, who found out that he wasn't the father, and as a response flung him out of the window of the car. The result was a frontal lobe syndrome, making him the suitable candidate to inherit the memory of CIA agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds), who was electrocuted to death during a mission. And this because the memory of Pope is full of information necessary to locate the Dutch hacker Jan Strook (Michael Pitt), also known as the The Dutchman, before he sells his sophisticated software to a crazy anarchist or the Russians. Software that could lead to a global nuclear war and total chaos.Well, it doesn't sound very plausible. And the film is packed with completely absurd idiocies such as setting up a GPS remotely and manipulating surveillance images in such a way that the secret service is chasing the wrong person. I always skipped this film because of the presence of Kevin Costner. In hindsight, I still ask myself how in God's name they got the idea to ask him. I associate Costner with other films where he's dancing with wolves, protecting a pop singer as a bodyguard and floating on a vast ocean as a kind of Mad Max. Jerico Stewart is a character Costner never played before, I think. But I must admit that he did it amazingly well. The aggression Jericho emanates and his violent behavior was played convincingly by Costner. His performance during the appropriation of a van (the owners are beaten up thoroughly), the confrontation with the widow (Gal Gadot) or the harassing language he uses against a pharmacist are some examples. The clash between Jericho's cheeky personality and Pope's more sophisticated behavior created some humorous scenes.For a moment it reminded me of ""The Bourne identity"". Both movies are about someone going through a personality crisis, not knowing who he is, what goal he has and what it's all about. Jerico is a loose object who runs around like a bull in a china shop, making downtown London unsafe. The only thing he's concentrating on, is the lost bag full of money. The story itself isn't really ingenious and will cause some head shaking when watching it. What remains is a pure spy action movie with quite some violence in it.Besides Costner there are some other heavyweights from Hollywood summoned for this film. There's also Tommy Lee Jones who takes care of the character Dr. Frank. All in all, this part isn't really meaningful and apparently he participated reluctantly, judging by the expression on his face (or is this a standard expression?). Fact is that the number of wrinkles on his face is growing steadily. Then you have Gary Oldman as chief Quaker Wells. A similar character as Oldman played in ""Batman"", except that Quaker is more stupid and insensible. The most disappointing role was the one from Michael Pitt. He didn't sound like a Dutch hacker. This isn't a performance that'll stay in memory forever as the one he did in ""I Origins"" and ""Rob the Mob"". And finally Ryan ""Deadpool"" Reynolds who got the shortest role he ever had in his entire career.Even though the film lacks credibility, the subject is a bit over the top and they couldn't make up their mind if it was going to be a SF or a pure action film, this film still managed to surprise me pleasantly. I wasn't bored for a minute. But then again, probably I won't remember much of it anymore in a month or so. Or somebody could regenerate the memory in a similar manner. But that's highly unlikely, I guess.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Criminal
50,robertemerald,A criminal is brought out of prison to help with a terrorist plot,9,4 June 2017,This is my favorite Kevin Costner movie since Waterworld. And it's a successful merger of Bourne-like CIA with a science fiction element excitingly tied to a very primal villain. This is the sort of movie where you cheer as you munch your popcorn. If you like action this is an original and very welcome contribution to the genre.,Criminal
51,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Criminal,6,28 April 2016,"Here are a few observations I've made about some actors/actresses in 2016's Criminal (my latest review). OK, let's begin: Kevin Costner with his meager dialogue readings, grumbles, growls, and grunts. Gary Oldman with his umpteenth American accent, gets ticked off and yells customarily. Tommy Lee Jones who fades in and out of the film, talks fast and doesn't really get to emote. The prepossessing Alice Eve looks sedated while really phoning in her performance and finally, Ryan Reynolds is well, Ryan Reynolds. Now is Criminal the reunion-like sequel to Oliver Stone's JFK (Oldman, Costner, and Jones in the same flick together)? No, not really. This is a nastily violent, techy thriller that's edited tightly, preposterous, and flows nicely. For better or worse, Criminal is passable entertainment despite a premise that is seemingly ""on parole"" (ha-ha). And Costner who looks so far gone from trying to get in the Academy's good graces (remember Dances with Wolves from 25+ years ago?), bulks up here all the while trying to become a successor to Liam Neeson (oh my, the badass, senior antihero circuit is ever expanding).Filmed primarily in London, England and distributed by Summit Entertainment, Criminal on the surface, projects itself to be another straight-to-video endeavor. There's its poster channeling 2015's Extraction (released only on DVD) and then there's the generic title (which feels a little hackneyed). Don't be fooled though, this is a movie that's above the limited release muck. The production values are stronger and director Ariel Vromen (The Iceman) seems to know what he's doing with the camera. Yeah Criminal does promote itself as action for the bloody, horror film host. And yes, its script, musical score, nullified computer speak, and slick look come off as rather stock at times. Here's the thing however: Criminal does deserve a true, theatrical release (despite what I initially thought). Just imagine something above Costner's previous 3 Days to Kill and slightly below Pierce Brosnan's The November Man. Not half bad as far as I'm concerned.The story is sort of unoriginal yet somehow someway, an audience member could be distracted from that notion. Jericho Stewart (Costner) is a despicable man, a convict with a frontal lobe disorder. As the film tells us, ""he has no impulse control, he's unable to calculate the consequences of his actions, and he has a total lack of empathy for anybody or anything."" Because of his condition, Jericho has been tapped to be an experiment for the CIA. Supervisor Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) with the help of Dr. Mahal Franks (played by Tommy Lee Jones), wants to infuse the memory implants of a dead agent (Ryan Reynolds as Bill Pope) into Stewart's brain. This will enable Costner's Stewart to find the location of a computer hacker known as 'the Dutchman' (played by Micheal Pitt). Said 'Dutchman' has the ability to create a wormhole bent on protecting the world's nuclear defense codes. This diegesis is all made simple by Vromen's gruesome, penchant for street-style brutality and Costner's free-based arrogance (he likes to play these types of characters a lot). Look for a scene where Jericho uses a sharp part of a police vehicle to rip a cop's neck open. Also, look for another scene where Costner's Jericho beats a female malefactor with a disassembled lamp. Talk about Antoine Fuqua kitsch that's truly not for the kiddies. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",Criminal
52,Kingslaay,Great cast but film has no substance,6,25 December 2019,"When I read the synopsis and saw the cast I thought I would be in for a treat. This is a dogs breakfast of a film.

53,leftbanker-1,Nothing New or Interesting Here,1,2 July 2016,"What Hollywood needs desperately is to find a few writers who have never seen a movie before in their lives. I think this is the only way to keep from making the same movies over and over again. In this action drama they begin with what they think is some highly original idea, transferring the mind of a valuable CIA asset into the head of a psychotic killer. Throw in a few car chases, a lot of gun play, a heaping helping of clichés, and you have Criminal.This pic gives new meaning to the idea of gratuitous violence. I wonder how many people died from start to finish. News flash: Hans Gruber died in Die-hard so you can't revive his character for the villain in this huge budget excuse for a thriller—and simply changing his nationality doesn't disguise this plagiarism. Then there is Hans Gruber's right hand girl, the sociopathic femme fatale, which I suppose is meant to be seen as progress for women but is just completely stupid. And if you want to have a guy called ""The Dutchman"" then use a real Dutch guy with a real accent instead of some hack actor with a phony one.In the end this movie is little more than the sum total of about 30 movies of its ilk, and by ""ilk"" I mean dumb action movies. The undead dead thing has been used about a thousand times, I mean when someone is supposed to be dead but they really aren't, and they used that in this movie on a few occasions. There is the very important matter of how the criminal escapes. He is an extremely dangerous murderer yet they throw him in the back of a car with his hands cuffed in front of him and then proceed to ignore him in such a way as to make the mother of that child who ended up in the gorilla cage look like parent of the year.",Criminal
54,leftbanker-1,Stupidity at Breakneck Speed,1,24 December 2018,"This movie gave me déjà vu, at least at first it did until I remembered that I had tried to watch it before and stopped after my limited intelligence was insulted.So I understand that we are called on to suspend belief for the bit about transferring memory from one person to the other. That is what fiction is all about. What I can't accept is how they put the guy's memories into a head of a maniac and then the guy's wife is left on her own, even after enough time has passed to realize that something has gone wrong with the plan. Stupidity is not what fiction should be based upon.They have the ability to track a man running through the streets and metro of London but an alarm sounds in the house of the wife of the prime player in the story, they call the house and a man answers, and he's able to call them off? Stupid. Really stupid.A day later he's driving around in a work van he stole the night before. As I said, they can track an individual sprinting through the streets but they can't find this vehicle? He may as well be cruising around London on a parade float.And then there is comically evil bad guy, who shouts out muu-ha-ha-haa every now and again. OK, he doesn't really but that's about the only evil guy cliché they left out.Then there is The Dutchman. What a stupid name! Have you ever heard the one about a thousand monkeys with typewriters writing Shakespeare if they had enough time? It only took one monkey to come up with The Dutchman in two minutes with no typos. Bravo! Give him a couple of Red Bulls and a pizza and he could rock out the entire screenplay by quitting time.""We need to find Jerico."" Two people utter this moronic and completely obvious statement. What else could they say? ""I need to spend less on car insurance.""And then he goes back to his home, and again, it isn't guarded.And then it gets really stupid, so stupid that I lost all memory of this movie.

The film's edgy tone gives the illusion of depth within the brutal and ruthless violence, while the excellent cast adds weight to a variety of the other characters.

There is all: from being wounded to being in love, from betrayal to having courage. All in authentic, 1st person experience, with all scientific details. Liked the stunts and technology too. Bit more amateur and typical than some best movies but still very good. Looks real. Similar bit to Prison Break, Jason Bourne, CSI, Replicas. Story is bit amateur and unrealistic, showing hacker and government making amateur mistakes, as if they are not trained, too unreal. But topic is the best.

But the link is far greater.The story itself has so many references to Frankenstein that it's a wonder people miss them. Dr. Franks is the man heading up the operation. Jericho (the bad guy with the good frontal cortex) plays attentively with the little girl (as he does in a deadly fashion in the original). Jericho learns about music (as he does with the fiddle player). Jericho gets to smoke (as he does with the cigar smoking blind man). Jericho shrieks like a banshee before the good cortex sinks in(as the monster shrieked before he was taught language) etc. etc.Putting aside the obvious Frankenstein references, the film could have been better and it lagged in places, largely a function of mediocre directing.",Criminal
58,one9eighty,Great cast but otherwise nothing new,6,29 September 2020,"Directed by Ariel Vromen this 2016 film has a runtime of 113 minutes and has a cast of A-List Hollywood player to delight. On it's release this film received extremely mixed reviews; some calling it a dark cult classic, while others suggesting it is just an updated version of the 1997 John Travolta and Nicolas Cage cult classic ""Face/Off"", or other body swap sci-fi films.Brief plot:
The memories of a killed CIA operative are put into the brain of a criminal in order to stop World War 3.Detailed plot:
CIA operative Bill Pope is killed in the line of duty while trying to track down shadowy hacker, ""The Dutchman"". Using an experimental procedure Pope's memories are transferred into the head of dangerous convict Jericho Stewart.Stewart begins his mission with Pope's memories leading the way, but things get complicated, especially when the memories get more powerful and more real. Considering Pope's knowledge of America's Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles he becomes a target for the CIA as well as the anarchists he was supposed to be stopping.Film Stuff:
This action thriller was mainly filmed in the centre of London, but some scenes were filmed in Hampshire, Croydon and Surrey too. Written by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg, with cinematography by Dana Gonzales and editing by Danny Rafic. Haim Mazar was initially signed up to do the musical score, but was replaced by Brian Tyler and Keith Power.A budget of $31.5 million mean that this was never going to be a big budget blockbuster, but instead a more character driven film. Unfortunately, with global box-office takings at $38.8 million this film was seen as a commercial flop.Cast:
With Kevin Costner, Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman heading the casting, you've already got some real big hitters in this film. They all do a decent job, but then, director Vromen seems to have the entire cast bringing convincing performances. Costner is the real stand out here, starting fairly empty and void of life he grunts his ways through a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings until he convinces us that he's a changed and learned character. It's a nice ark of character development as his dangerous persona feels love and family and ends the film a different person from what he started.Wrap up:
This film was OK, but just OK rather than anything special. With other sci-fi action films having similar plots where there is some kind of a body swap the concept in this film is nothing new. Lot of action with plenty of violence and bloodshed doesn't save a bland script and unoriginal story with lots of plot holes. The best thing this film has going for it really is the stellar cast of actors who all do a decent job with what they have been given. Rated 15 in the UK and R in the USA, this film certainly isn't for the younger audiences. Like I said, it was OK, but that all really, nothing new, nothing revolutionary, nothing that's going to leave a permanent mark on the face of Hollywood films. At best, this is a 6 out of 10.",Criminal
59,bankofmarquis,Criminally misdirected,4,20 April 2016,"Often times, after I see a film, I look up the director and writer of a film on IMDb to find out more about them. After seeing the Kevin Costner starring film CRIMINAL, I set out to find out more about Director Ariel Vromen and Writers Douglas Cook and David Weisberg.So I can make sure that I NEVER sit through another movie of their's again.CRIMINAL has an interesting premise, the memories of a dying spy are implanted in the brain of a criminal, slowly, those two minds battle, who will emerge? The smart, kind spy? Or the umempathetic, hard edged CRIMINAL (now with super spy skills)? They even enlisted a pretty good list of actors - Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones. Even Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, shows up for a few scenes.So where did it all go wrong?Let's start with the Direction. Vromen, known for 2012's THE ICEMAN (I know, I haven't heard of it either), makes a ""criminal"" sin in this type of movie, he took an interesting premise that could have been a ""bang bang"" Arnold or Willis movie and decided to throw artsy touches and long takes, filming in semi-darkness the ENTIRE film. This makes this movie seem long, languid and BORING. I kept wanting to scream to the screen ""pick up the pace""! The action sequences are mediocre at best and the performances he pulls out of the actors range from bored (Tommy Lee Jones) to over- the- top shouty (Oldman) to Nick Nolte-level grunting (Costner). And that's too bad as they had a chance to make Costner's character really interesting. Jones states that Jericho (Costner) cannot tell right from wrong. Apparently, that means cutting in line at Starbucks and killing bad guys or guys that ""had it coming"". How about putting some real ""I don't know right from wrong"" moments in here that would shock, or at least get our attention. Have him punch a Nun. Have him pee on a cat. Have him liking BATMAN V SUPERMAN. ANYTHING that would make his character actually interesting.At this point in a bad review, I usually pick out one performance that I can say ""at least that was good"". The best I could do here is to say that Gadot and Alice Eve (Star Trek: Into Darkness) didn't suck.Oh, did I mention Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool, himself!) was in this film? I wonder who he owed this brief favor to.As for the writing, I usually ""go with the flow"" in these types of movies, and will cut it slack for moments of logistical nonsense and ""non-science science"", but there were a few plot holes in this movie that I just could not get past. I couldn't understand how the bad guys found out about Costner and I REALLY couldn't understand why they cared about him. Don't even get me started about the inevitable ""twist"" at the end. It made no sense and I just couldn't ""go with it"".You can try to ""go"" with this movie. Or, more to the point, you can ""go past"" this movie and check out something better in this genre, like Arnold in TOTAL RECALL or Travolta and Cage in FACE OFF.5 out of 10 stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis).",Criminal

Will it help having Wonder Woman on his side?I thought Kevin Costner just about stole the show with a gritty masculine performance.Some decent action sequences plus a sprinkling of catchy music makes this movie worthy of a respectable:6/10.,Criminal
61,dave-mcclain,"""Criminal"" isn't a terrible movie; it's just a stupid movie.",3,16 April 2016,"Before I get on with my energetic mockery of ""Criminal"" (R, 1:53), I'd like to tell you about the opening scene – one of the film's few which isn't cringe-worthy: Knowing that a heroic character is about to be killed can be tense. You know he's going to die soon because that's made clear in the movie's theatrical trailer and sets up the whole plot, but you don't know how it's going to happen (and I'm not going to spoil it). As the character careens from one dangerous situation to the next, you feel like the director is playing a game of Jenga with the unfortunate character's life – and your emotions. It's too bad that the script by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg (who co-wrote 1996's ""The Rock"") and the direction by Ariel Vromen (who made 2012's criminally underseen contract killer biopic ""Iceman"", with Michael Shannon) didn't make this entire film as smart as its beginning.When Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds), an American CIA agent stationed in London is killed, Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman), the CIA's London Station Chief, goes into a bit of a panic. There's a Spanish anarchist with the (odd) name Hagbardaka Heimbahl (Jordi Mollà) out there and he wants to decimate the capital cities of major world powers so he can show (what's left of) the world how (what's left of) the world should properly be governed. (Think, Ted Cruz or Bernie Sanders on crack.) When Hamhock (sorry Heimbahl) calmly explains his idea in an ordinary-sounding TV interview, all he needs is the cooperation of his favorite missing computer hacker. But the CIA wants the hacker too.Before he stopped breathing, Pope was trying to secure a computer program called ""Wormhole"", which fits on a flash drive and can control the U.S. military's worldwide arsenal of missiles. Pope was on his way to meet Jan Stroop (Michael Pitt), who calls himself ""The Dutchman"" (a VERY safe and secure on-line name for a Dutch computer hacker). Only Pope knows where The Dutchman is, so with Pope dead, the CIA is SOL (Seemingly Out of Luck). But hold on! Pope's not REALLY dead, he is just most nearly dead.There's still brain activity! There's also an American scientist named Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones) who has successfully transferred memories from one mammal to another and thinks his process can work the same way on humans! There's a chance to save Pope's memories! Oh, happy day! If only Franks had a suitable human host for what's left of Pope. Wait – he does!! It's a good thing that the movie's title character, a dangerous, completely amoral prison inmate named Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner), has an underdeveloped brain that would make the perfect ""clean slate"" on which to transfer Pope's memories! It's too bad that when Stewart wakes up after his major brain surgery, he cannot immediately recall the hacker's whereabouts. Oh, well. Rather than wait a little longer to see if Stewart will come up with this potentially world-saving information, Wells decides simply to have him killed. (Arrrrgh!) The movie's set-up may be ridiculous, but at least there are good guys to root for and bad guys to root against. However, most of these characters are wearing both white hats and black hats. Dr. Franks is a mild-mannered scientist who admits that he's years away from human trials, yet immediately agrees to operate on a human subject without Stewart's consent or even understanding of what is going on. Wells (ironically, the same last name as the scientist who put bionic parts into Steve Austin in TV's ""The Six Million Dollar Man"") is ostensibly trying to save lives, but tosses aside those who don't matter to him.Hambone (Heimbahl. Whatever.) is willing to disregard the rights of millions of people who don't agree with him, but, hey, it's all about making the world great again, so it's okay. (He's just telling it like it is.) Hummelfigure has a henchman (excuse me, henchwoman) named Elsa Mueller (Antje Traue, rocking ginger locks) who is every bit as ruthless as Stewart, but she forgives and hugs her beloved homicidal maniac after he apologizes for a verbal outburst, so, she's kinda cool. The Dutchman has the power to destroy the whole world with his computer program, but he doesn't really want to. (That's why this highly irresponsible computer expert fled from that highly insane anarchist.) Stroop is willing to give Wormhole to the CIA... for a U.S. passport – and $10 million. (But ""it's not about the money"".) Even though Costner's character is described (and shown in his prison cell) as a less cannibalistic, but more dangerous version of Hannibal Lecter, he behaves more like a spoiled child albeit an extremely violent spoiled child. (Think the ""Affluenza Teen"", without the money, but with Rocky Balboa's fists and The Terminator's family values.) The only really decent people in this film are the Popes. (Sorry. Bad phrasing.) Bill, his erstwhile wife, now widow, Jill (Gal Gadot), and their sweet young daughter, Emma (Lara Decaro), are decent folks whose goodness rubs off on Stewart when they um, get inside his head.""Criminal"" is not a terrible movie; it's just a stupid movie. Many political thrillers require Movie Fans to press the ""I Believe"" button, but I wore my button the --ck (heck) out in the film's first 20 minutes or so. Ignoring the story's silliness and plot holes, I actually enjoyed the film's action and its resolution, but that's not good enough. My advice? When ""Criminal"" is out on video, watch the trailer to remind you of the set-up, then start watching the movie at the DVD/Blu-ray chapter ""The CIA Guy Tell His Thugs to 'Take Out the Trash', But the Criminal is Too Stupid to See What's Happening and Gets In the Agents' Car Anyway"" (or whatever they end up titling that scene). Watching this entire movie should be illegal. ""C""",Criminal
62,Vivekmaru45,"If you're a Kevin Costner fan, don't miss this great film.",10,1 September 2018,"I missed watching this film in 2016, I saw it in September 2018. The majority of film critics gave this film a negative review however as of 1st September 2018 it holds a rating of 6.3 which is a score given to good films. The film reprises three A grade actors Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman who last worked together in the film JFK(1991). Here all three actors give thoroughly professional performances.Plot: When Spanish industrialist-turned-anarchist Xavier Heimdahl arranges for his associate Jan Strook-a hacker known as ""the Dutchman""-to create a wormhole program that would allow the owner to bypass all computer codes protecting the world's nuclear defense codes, the Dutchman panics and attempts to hand his secret over to the CIA. He makes contact with London-based agent Bill Pope, but although Pope is able to get the Dutchman to a safe house and recover the money to pay him for his services, he is caught by Heimdahl's men and tortured to death before he can tell anyone where he hid the Dutchman. Desperate to find the Dutchman, Pope's CIA supervisor Quaker Wells contacts Dr. Micah Franks, who has developed a treatment that could theoretically plant the memory patterns of a dead man onto a living one. Keeping Pope's brain stimulated to preserve its knowledge, Franks requests that convict Jerico Stewart be the subject of the procedure, as Stewart's criminal behavior is the result of childhood brain trauma leaving him with an underdeveloped frontal lobe, hindering his emotional development and impulse control, that they can use to ""graft"" Pope's knowledge into Stewart's mind.See the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: I enjoyed the film immensely. The direction was spot on and the background sound-effects enhanced the film. Photography was exceptional as well. Ariel Vromen who directs the film has also made another good film called
The Iceman(2012), based on the true story of longtime notorious hitman Richard Kuklinski. I also recommend these movies for you to see: Memento(2000), The Final Cut (2004), Source Code(2011), Rememory(2017).",Criminal

65,abisio,Just one of the best thrillers of the year,10,24 April 2016,A recent Kevin Costner European produced thriller was such a joke that not even himself look comfortable; however it is not the case in Criminal where gives a humble but very strong performance as psycho with memories implanted from a CIA spy killed in the kind of mission that could represent the end of the world. Kevin's Jerico had his brain damaged as a kid after a violent attack. He cannot discern good from bad so he is basically a psychotic criminal with no conscience. His brain; is however the perfect place to implant the memories of a dead CIA agent; killed in London for a group of Anarchist lead by the Spanish Jordi Molla. As first the implant does not seems to work; so CIA local director Quakes (Gary Oldman doing a character as cruel as Costner's but supposedly on the good guys side) order his disposal. Jericho escapes and start remembering about some money the dead agent was carrying. Things go very violent; the kind that is not easy to swallow. The movie does not try to create even one good guy; everybody is disposable and the result justify the means. The Jericho character is incredible violent and does not care to kill innocent bystanders. It is really a pity that at the end the two main characters get more human; but is a minor defect in a movie that keep you hook on your seat for almost two hours.In brief; do not miss it.,Criminal

I saw so many action filled films similar to this one that I could not get entertained that much. Yes, it is set in London and that gives a nice touch to the whole thing, but it so unrealistic that I could not get serious about this film. It is an interesting idea to give a convicted felon a life so he can have a house, wife, child and so on, but please give me a break. It is not realistic.Acting: Acting is good and Mr. Costner really tried to give something so this film would get off the ground but it did not help that much.If you like action packed films this is one for you but if you do not you can freely skip it.",Criminal
67,JohnRayPeterson,"From Psychopath to Caring Human Being, and a whole lot more",8,17 July 2016,"I know, I know the reviews thus far from popular ratings sites don't score this movie too high, but this is one you should judge for yourself.Keep in mind the cast; this was my first reason to consider watching 'Criminal', my second and third as well. I'm not in the habit of repeating IMDb's full Storyline so I'll let you read that for yourself if you haven't already, and I'll add my take on that, at the risk of revealing some parts you really should discover on your own. But don't worry, I'll give you a warning just before the spoiler.So, the cast includes Kevin Costner, the main character; some roles are good for him, some not, the role of emotionless psychopath in this movie is right up his alley. Then there's Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds, Jordi Mollà (oh you'll remember him when you see him), the gorgeous Gal Gadot who you should remember as Gisele from the Fast and Furious franchise and Michael Pitt as 'The Dutchman' who everybody is trying to catch in this movie. You may think the storyline is that of a B movie, but the script by Douglas Cook and David Weisberg (they wrote The Rock) and direction by Ariel Vromen who directed the 2012 movie 'The Iceman', a movie you ought to have watched if you like tough characters, then you can start to understand why it is not a B movie. It is packed with action, suspense, twists and it will keep you engaged.The part when Reynolds' memory is transferred to Kostner's brain is done effectively, thanks to Tommy Lee Jones credible acting as the doctor who devised the procedure. In fact Jones' participation, minimal as it may be, always comes just in time to add that credibility element throughout the movie, right to the ending scene, my favourite of the movie.The movie lasts one hour and fifty three minutes, but it absolutely feels like a much shorter one. In my humble opinion this an important reason for the critical comments about 'Criminal'. Cook and Weisberg's story would have made a terrific novel because of the secondary sub-plot, the one dealing with Mollà's criminal organization and The Dutchman's role in that organization. In the near two hours movie there was simply no way to expand on that sub-plot. So, moviegoers have to piece together the relation of The Dutchman and Mollà's criminal organization. For those who enjoy a good novel as much as they do movies, that won't be a problem. But I feel those who didn't would have been left with what might be perceived as a messy story, but it isn't. Let me explain.Here come the spoiler parts.The Dutchman, Pitt, worked for Mollà who is an advocate of global anarchy, because he thinks he alone should rule the world, not unlike leaders of cults and such. When Pitt found a vulnerability in the US military arsenal control and developed a program to take over the control while disabling its failsafe measures, he knew he had in his possession the ultimate war device, one his boss Mollà would not hesitate to use for his mad quest. So of course Pitt negotiates with the CIA to sell them that program for lots of money and protection to hide from Mollà. That's the part that you have to piece together from bits of scenes throughout the movie. Furthermore, at the beginning of the movie, Reynolds, the CIA agent who was charged with the mission to make good on Pitt's deal is killed by Mollà' himself, he having figured out Pitt's defection, and this is something Pitt didn't know and concluded he was screwed by the CIA. Again it's something you piece together during the movie, but not knowing this makes it harder to understand why Pitt turns to the Russian FSB for the same deal. See what I mean by the story making a better novel than a two hour movie!So if you read comments that the storyline is messy, it's because it has a criminal organization, the CIA, The FSB, and a psychopath with no allegiance and a third sub- plot (my favourite) I'll get to just below, all in one movie. When the CIA decided to move ahead a secret program to transfer memories from a recently dead person into another living human being, this suddenly having become a necessity for them to find Pitt, using dead Reynolds brain, Jones picked the best candidate for the procedure, but it happened to be Costner, a psychopath with no emotions. As Reynolds memories start to rebuild in Costner's brain, his personality also starts to change. It is a haphazard process as one should expect, and as Jones explains. Reynolds widow and child become as important to Costner as they were to Reynolds and in the end the psychopath has become a human being, worthy of a second chance. That aspect of the movie is the one I most liked, though the fight Costner puts up with all parties to get Pitt's money and break free turned out as well after all the twists.It has a Hollywood ending, so those who don't care for such thing, don't bother; I wanted to be fair in my review, but I still think it's worth watching of course.",Criminal
68,jayraskin1,Jason Bourne Meets Frankenstein Meets Hannibal Lector Meets Deadpool,4,21 May 2016,"The style is imitation Jason Bourne. Kevin Costner is relentless. It is also relentlessly stupid 75% of the time. The C.I.A. has a hundred agents, all the police in London and technology to view every street in London, and instantly identify every person with face recognition, but it keeps losing Costner, plus the guy he's trying to find - a hacker called the Dutchman, and the bad guy- Anarchist. They can plant memories in Costner's head, but they forget to plant a tracking device in his body. The Dutchman has hacked into every defense system in the United States and launch any nuclear missile at will. Smart guy, right? Yet he asks for $10 million dollars to return control to the C.I.A. It reminds one of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers who demands 1 million dollars to not destroy the world. Does this guy really think the C.I.A. and security agencies around the world are going to just leave him alone if he gets 10 million dollars? He can still hack into the national defense systems and destroy the world. He apparently can control all the weapons in the world from a thumb drive. Yep, a thumb drive. One could have a good time laughing at the ridiculousness of the movie, but it really has a nasty edge to. Its like the writers said, of course this is ridiculous, but the audience is 16 year old imbeciles and they won't care. There is a lot of disgusting and pointless violence. Yeah, the 16year old sadistic imbeciles like to see people getting hurt, so lets have the hero hurt a lot of people, smashing things over their heads and punching them in the face. Another problem with the movie is that Michael Pitt who plays the Dutchman is really a handsome young actor and should have had the lead role and Kevin Costner should have had the much smaller Dutchman role.

69,Nozz,Arbitrariness is the big problem,6,29 April 2020,"In this tale of a sort of virtual memory transplant from brain to brain, the main character steps into a situation that's a little more complicated than we're accustomed to. It's the good guys versus the bad guys but with a renegade bad guy in addition who's just as dangerous as anyone else. I'm not sure why that complication was necessary, but it's not the picture's big problem. The big problem is that the scriptwriters have decided the memory transplant is kind of imperfect, maybe even kind of temporary, and they manipulate the degree of its effectiveness in order to help drive the plot. Since there's no such thing as a brain-to-brain memory transplant, there's no way to disguise the ups and downs of the result as anything realistic rather than arbitrary manipulation of the plot and thus of the audience.

73,PyroSikTh,Surprised How Good This Was,8,19 April 2016,"By way of it bursting out from nowhere with next to no marketing, and being funded by a hit- and-miss Lionsgate, I didn't exactly have high hopes for it. The trailer painted an interesting concept and the cast was enough to get me going anyway, but I at least hoped for an entertaining couple of hours. Well, it exceeded those expectations. Criminal opens with the death of an American spy living and working in London. Unfortunately the CIA need the information the spy had just before he died, otherwise the world would be in jeopardy from a Spanish anarchist, so they enlist the help of a doctor who's been working on the transfer of memories from one mammal to the next. The candidate for the experiment is a violent psychopath locked away in maximum solitary, who doesn't know how to function in society and completely lacks empathy for those around him. Of course gaining the memories of a father and husband opens up his mind to the emotions that have eluded him his entire life.The thing that surprised me most about Criminal was how refreshing it was. Jericho, being a violent psychopath and all, is not your typical hero. He's a complete asshole who just happens to have the memories of a good man in his head. This results in some entertaining scenes like him ordering something in French and having no idea what he just ordered, or thanking a clerk and immediately wondering why he did. He's generally not a likable guy, but you can't help to root for him and hope his identity crisis eventually leads to some humanity. He's also not some super human capable of anything. The American spy he gains the memories of is shown to be quite proficient with a gun, but Jericho doesn't gain any of the spy's physicality. Any talents he gains are intrinsically linked to the mental shift in his head (such as language and mathematics). It was also refreshing that the villain wasn't your typical villain. He wasn't Muslim, or Russian, or a drug lord. He was a bit more like a James Bond villain; a Spanish anarchist searching for a hacking program that would enable him to take control of the world's missile systems. This movie is brimming with recognisable faces, in addition to the ones in the trailer. Ryan Reynolds was rightly not made a big thing of in the marketing because he plays the spy who dies at the very beginning. However he does make quite an impact. He plays Bill Pope quite straight and level-headed, proving (again) that he is capable of more serious roles every now and then. Gary Oldman plays a character who's probably a polar opposite of that. Quaker Wells (seriously, this movie has a hard-on for unusual names for it's characters) is hot- headed and impatient, giving Oldman lots of shouting to do. I don't want to say it, but his character was maybe a little one-note. Tommy Lee Jones' Dr. Franks is a relatively small part, and Jones doesn't make too much of an impression with what he's given, but he's certainly serviceable as the remarkably calm doctor. Gal Gadot continues to prove me wrong about her acting. I mean, it's still not worthy of an Oscar, but she brings some great emotional depth to her grieving wife Jill Pope, playing the role of emotional anchor to Jericho.Talking of, I've never been a particular fan of Kevin Costner, but he was actually really, really good as Jericho. In his first appearance he's a threatening figure chained to his cell, with dashes of playful insanity thrown in. By the end he has a softer demeanour and look in his eyes. The journey between that is a spectrum of psychopath and emotional. His stone-cold, emotionless presence is slowly subdued and Costner does a fantastic job of adjusting that progressive balance in his character's emotional state. Michael Pitt, Jordi Molla, Antje Traue, and Alice Eve all do really well with their small supporting roles.I mentioned that there wasn't a lot of action in Criminal, but what action there is was gritty and realistic (to a point; a police car exploding into a lorry wasn't exactly the film's finest realism). It's not flashy or stylistic, it's straight to the point, and is often short and sharp. There isn't a lot of digitally created effects either. The most I noticed was an airplane exploding in the air, but it got bonus points for being a really logical and realistic explosion rather than just an indiscriminate ball of fire. Most of the action revolves around punch-ups and gun fights, and you feel every one thanks to the crisp sound design. The protagonists also miss just as much as the villains, making every shootout feel like a level playing-field.I went into Criminal hoping for a superficial action movie, but what I got was an emotionally- resonate thriller. It may be a bit slow at times for those expecting a more action-orientated pace, but it uses that shift in pace to give us a deeper look at Jericho and Bill Pope's life before he died, adding far more depth than I ever anticipated. Criminal isn't just entertaining, it was actually really, really good. I give it a solid 8/10, and would recommend.",Criminal

I will name them one by one.SPOILER CRIMINAL CHARACTERSRyan Reynolds: Although Criminal tries to cash in on his name, he has the most laconic role ever. He disappears with a cameo. Budget issues? I get it that it was supposed to be the storyline. But really, you kill him that early? At least delve into the details!Scott Adkins: The guy can do so much. But all Vromen asked him to do was stand next to Oldman taking orders, listening to what's next in the course like a normal guy. That was pretty much it! Did the director even know he could fight? Should have taken tips to include a fight scene at least?Michael Pitt: All he did was wait, smoke, wait more, react to some failure, eventually got shot.Antje Traue: She looked promising for a while as she slithered in that T-X kinda feel. But where does she end up? Under a bashed pot!Tommy Lee Jones: He appeared to the scene when he wanted to expound terse memory concepts, and to get ravaged by another 'Old'Man fury.Amaury Nolasco: He was just there.Alice Eve: Was she even there?Taking the spotlight to other actors now, those who could really act. Starting off with Kevin Costner. He still has it in him. You have to give it to him. Had this plot demanded more of him, I have no doubt he could deliver. Gal Gadot was simply good. Gary Oldman gets under the skin of his character so good that you cannot even poke him without getting gouged at. He is definitely good. Unfortunately none of them knew what ground they were in. It was a landslide, and they were dancing on it.BETTER DIRECTOR FOR CRIMINAL?I wish the concept of Criminal found a better director. Definitely not Ariel Vromen. There is no subtlety in him. It flung me into minutes of boredom and insouciance in the beginning itself that it was hard to concentrate. Good thing Costner did some crazy stuff to bring back the Mojo.

It stars A- listers both present (Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot) and past (Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman) bringing their game faces and having fun - none more so than Costner, here trolling more than ever with a gruff, can't-give-a-damn attitude that combines Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte and Keith Richards all in one ultra-badass, ultra-insane swoop.The film was produced by Millennium Films of Expendables and Olympus/London Has Fallen fame, and I'm digging their old- school action offerings. They never aspire to be high-brow entertainment, but given the right script – and this one is from the same scribes as The Rock (1996) – they can make fun movies with a rough-and-tough edge. This has added midnight movie strangeness to its concept, and to Vromen's credit, no action beat is missed.For reasons I'll never know, this film is being savaged by Western critics for being too 'dull' and 'dumb'. Perhaps I saw a different movie. It may be dumb, but it sure as hell isn't dull.",Criminal
79,rollernerd,"You hurt me, I hurt you worse",6,8 August 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the actin flick Criminal (2016) starring an ensemble cast including the likeable Kevin Costner, legends Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman and a brief cameo by Canadians favourite son, Ryan Reynolds. I was excited to watch this one as the first three peepz were all in a movie called JFK - so yep I was hyped up. What transpired was a different yet interesting film. We have Reynolds playing as CIA bloke Bill Pope at the very beginning who dies on a mission to track down someone called the ""Dutchman."" In a last-ditch effort to stop a world ending plot, the dead CIA agent's memories, skills and all that jazz are implanted into a death-row inmate in hopes that he will complete the mission. The guy they pick is none other than Costner's character the dangerous convict Jericho. The implant procedure has similar traits in creating the monster in Frankenstein and we see Costner do well in performing a split dual personality that he is forced to be subjected to. A cool part is when Costner craves doner kebabs and starts bopping to some electro dancey dance tunes while he beats up a few baddies, get into shootouts, has a few car chases and of course saves the day. While grunting and scolding Costner is the one who makes this interesting story come out as an impeccable portrait of a sick psychopath who is greatly affected by an unapproved medical procedure. The remaining cast members are okay, including Tommy Lee Jones who restrains his role - some performed well and other just shouted their dialogue. Plus cudos to Gal Gadot as the wife of Pope who makes her character believable. The story itself is what breaks the film - some part did not fit and make sense for example how did the bad guys escape from the authorities during the bridge sequence? And how did the bad guys get Costner's Jericho out of the library without anyone seeing them? Overall, not the best of all movies due to sloppy writing but still an interesting one 6/10.",Criminal
80,ritera1,"Very interesting, although didn't reach its potential",8,6 June 2016,"That was very much do to the lackluster direction of Ariel Vromen, who has a poor track record. My guess is they chose him because it bore similarities to his previous The Iceman (which didn't match up to the far more interesting, but very disturbing, real person). Iceman was mostly fictionalized and not worth the effort.Much of my praise revolves around the Costner character. It brought up a lot of interesting questions about nature vs. nurture. In the film, he suffered a very severe brain injury that eliminated his impulse control and empathy. Thus there's a whole lot of questions that swirl around bad and good and the soul of man.But it really didn't explore that very well. It hung onto those elements while delivering a decent action ticking-clock film with a predictable ending. Costner's character had done some very bad things in life and during the film. He really needed a strong dose of guilt about all that but it was kind of white-washed in favor of trying to make him a conventional hero, which he wasn't. Some other very good actors doing the best they could. The action was run-of-the-mill except for the very good confrontation at on the tarmac at the end. But his supposed guilt was glossed over when the character caused a couple of cops to be killed pursuing him in the final car chase. The character celebrated that even after the half-hearted attempt at him previously feeling guilt .It's really more for a student of film that could forgive the poor elements of this.",Criminal
81,jb_campo,Costner Kills in Criminal,8,18 August 2016,"Wow, I loved Criminal, which is surprisingly good. You need to know it's bloody and violent, but if you are OK with that, the story, acting, and action really rock.The cast is a veteran crew, starring Kevin Costner as Jerico, an absolute psycho who is in prison because he has no way to differentiate right from wrong due so some brain injury from his childhood. As it turns out, he is the 1 in a bazillion candidate for the new procedure, experimental, from the lab of scientist Tommy Lee Jones. That's the start of why I loved this movie. Costner didn't want this part, but the producers convinced him that he was what they needed. Wow, what a role and he sinks his teeth into it. He is brutal, unforgiving, unrepentant, and gets his head cold. You'll see.Jones is this kind of quirky doctor who actually gives a crap about Costner as his patient. He and Costner are kind of like giving each other a purpose in life. They are both loners, with nothing much besides themselves.Enter Ryan Reynolds, yes, Deadpool/Green Lantern, again. Isn't he in about every movie you see now? His role is short but critical. Let's not forget his wife, played wonderfully by Gal Gadot, the new Wonder Woman.Memory transference is the key to this movie, but what makes this movie great is Costner. He's evil, no feelings, but slowly, creepily, something starts in his brain that he never felt before. He attacks it like he does everything in life. What an awesome portrayal of this change by Costner.What is also great is that this movie actually makes you root for a bad guy who is becoming a good guy to return to be a bad guy, because he's fighting other bad guys, almost kind of like Dr Jekyl/Mr Hide, but smoother.Gary Oldman plays a key role too as the leader of the military or govt that is trying to save the world, all hinging on this guy with a hole in his head, a real psycho.There's one scene that is straight out of Silence of the Lambs. Again at an airport. In some ways, Jerico plays on Hannibal Lector a bit from the totally psycho side at the start, butthen as someone who is actually becoming a somewhat reasonable man as he learns more about Gal Gadot and her husband Reynolds.Criminal is not for the faint of heart. Costner goes berserk many times. But Costner just kills this role with such great acting, that I think you will love this movie. Criminal is a must-see flick. Enjoy.",Criminal
82,srdjan_veljkovic,"A strange mix of good, bad, dull, fun, stupid, interesting...",5,25 April 2016,"Gary Oldman is bad. Never seen him this bad, like he wants to do a bad job.Gal Gadot is good. Never seen her this good, usually she just walks around, as if it's enough - well, for some purposes, it actually is, but, for the purpose of acting, it is as if someone finally got to her.Tommy Lee Jones is dull. It's like ""I got the money, I'm gonna say the lines, but for real performance, give me more money or a better script"".Kevin Costner is fun. This is not his traditional role, he's not great, but he's fun.Script is stupid. Not just the silly mind-transfer surgery thing. Pretty much all of it.But, the ideas behind this are interesting and Costner and Gadot also have a few interesting scenes. Also, it does seem like someone put a lot of actors from DC characters movies together on purpose. Kind of makes you think, Alice Eve is surely up for a DC character, otherwise why is she here? Apparently, her agent hasn't told her yet, 'cause she also doesn't quite get why is she in this movie.I could go on, but you get the picture. A very, very strange mix of unmixable things.",Criminal
83,FallenEye,A Criminal Waste.,5,28 May 2017,"I'm not sure who Ariel Vromen is, nor am I familiar with his work, but honestly, I have to imagine that this man, or somebody heavily involved in this film, was owed one hell of a favor from someone up top in Summit, Lionsgate or Hollywood, because this director had a star studded cast that he did little, to nothing with... a cast that had no reason to say yes to being a part of this movie - especially Ryan - but they did anyway.Gal Gadot, may not be the best actor out there, but, she is A-List and well worth a watch, but, lets say she isn't enough to guarantee commercial success and a fierce Mystery Action Thriller. You then have Gary Oldman (who's role I feel is probably the most idiotic he has ever taken) and Tommy Lee Jones. And lets just say that wealth of experience is also not enough... Kevin Costner steps in too! All of that, including Ryan Reynolds, who's talents had no business being in this movie - which probably explains why he is uncredited - also joined the party, and on composition, Brian Tyler. Somebody pulled some strings, and Criminal had it all... then did nothing with it.This movie is boring. Just put simply. The story, so promising, but even worse, so squandered. Badly edited, badly directed, and all around badly executed. Tommy was incredibly underused, Gary's character was an idiot. Ryan is too big for his role. For Gadot, this was a pay check, and Kevin Costner, with a much better director, would've been right for his role.I was ready to give Criminal 4/10, but something happened in the film that warranted a bump to 5/10... What that was, I can't remember. It must be Billy's memories and personality that affected my brain through the movie. And Ryan, don't think we've forgotten that right before this film, you starred in Self/Less! However, I still have nothing but love for you.Criminal had the potential to be a wicked, gangster hit. Sadly, what they did with it, was just, Criminal.",Criminal
84,dpolwatte,Criminal : An attempt to reboot the sci-fi action genre,7,5 December 2018,"With an amazing cast from both the past and current in hollywood, Criminal (2016) attempts to build the atmosphere of films like Universal Soldier (1992), Minority Report (2002) and Paycheck (2003).It comes out okay for me. It was a good film.Good action sequences. Typical enemy. Bad turned good anti-heroes. Giant screens and CIA stuff.Not a bad film.Overall - 3.5/5",Criminal
85,digdog-785-717538,an enjoyable film who is its own worst enemy,7,17 July 2016,"**MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDED**out of the gate, putting Kevin Costner - whom i suspect was a driving force behind this production - in this role is the proverbial shot in the foot; there is just no way anyone is going to see him as anything but the one, same character he plays in every film.And yet you can see him clearly trying his best and most to not-be the same guy he always is, the emotional, righteous person empowered by justice. or, just Kevin Costner.See, this film is half based on Costner's character being a savage, brutal killer, and half being Costner The Director's classic soppy, emotional shlock where everyone must turn good and there's gotta be an happy ending. So you see what i mean when i say, this film is its own worst enemy; if *anyone else* had been cast in this film as the lead, even an unknown, it would have been better. Pick whether you want to make a grim, sadistic film, or a carebear film where everything turn out for the best, and stick with it, don't jump between styles.Criminal is the story of a thing which is very dangerous. The Amuricans are looking to get it back and the bad guys are looking to steal it. While trying to get the thing, one good guy dies, so they put his brain in Costner's brain. Costner was a bad guy but he becomes a good guy, he kills all the bad guys and gets the thing. (Winner of 2016 Most Innovative Plot Award)Criminal uses fairly well all the other actors it has, without over-saturating the screen time with them, and by keeping the plot moving. It's not perfect, it has a couple things which are plain bad (how they drag the wife back into the picture, a totally unnecessary twist which goes against the tone of the film), it can't decide if it wants to be a hard and unforgiving film, or an emotional feelgood film. But all in all, it's a pretty decent spy story with an unusual character in the lead; Costner in himself is not bad, the direction is pretty solid, the dialogue is decent (the Dutchman is horrible and should be completely re-written), and just to remind you that this is Hollywood, the ending is garbage.I liked Criminal. I liked it despite its baffling choices of cast and plot, and while i will say that this film could have been made into a really epic film and it wasn't, which is a shame, it's still worth the price of a ticket.my vote: 7/10 - conservative here, innovative there, faulty but enjoyable.",Criminal
86,PetarNeo,Costner: love tale of terminator changing into loving machine,5,15 September 2016,"Don't know is this is supposed to be a Costner movie or just lazy, not interesting, not caring and boring. At the start it has a little suspense and some twisty moment where you get some feeling for the movie. Then after they ""transplanted"" dead agents thoughts onto living human being it just falls apart. You get swamped by too many character that don't even matter, feeling is like you are lost and you are wondering around thinking what to do next and it looks like Costner character is on some path to redeem himself as he now is able to feel. All brutality that Jerico strikes upon every human that he gets in touch is remarkable because it feels like he is a machine from Terminator determined to beat up everyone. Even some complicated situations are resolved very quick with some kill or some stupid idea, for instance Dutchman kill was so lame, but Jerico's reaction on his kill was even more absurd. At the end you get a love story, where they managed to imprint feelings onto Jerico which was a walking killing machine and he now loves everyone and is super kind. Idea for the movie was on shaky ground from the beginning and then directing was also not so good as well as writing of some dialogue. Acting of cast that is capable of great things kept movie from falling totally apart. 2/4",Criminal

88,gcsman,Kevin Costner is the main reason to see this,5,21 July 2018,"Other reviewers have given plot summaries so I'll just focus on the acting and production, both of which are pretty much ... routine. It's not a bad film. For a modern action thriller it's competently made, but without anything really special going on, including the last-minut Reveal. It's quite watchable throughout though, and Kevin Costner is the standout once he's introduced. He maintains his gruff, gravel-voiced demeanor from start to finish, first as a criminally psycho violence-prone baddie unable to even tell right from wrong. But once the memories of a recently-killed espionage agent are inserted into his brain, things change bit by bit until he essentially recovers his humanity and saves the day. The rest of the cast is impressive on paper, including Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, Alice Eve among others. (Gadot is seen here just before moving on to Wonder Woman.) But the thing is, except for Costner they're all replaceable. They all do just fine, but you can visualize any of half a dozen other actors doing their roles equally well because the dialog and plot devices are all routine. Costner's part is the one that is really distinctive, so see it for that (but not worth paying for a DVD -- the Netflix option is just fine).",Criminal

The AAA players that were present on the screen were fantastic, but the other characters just fell extremely flat. To be honest, if it wouldn't have been for the absolutely breathtaking moments between Costner and Gadot I would have scored this movie much lower. The exchange between them regarding Bill's past and their life together was inspired and for me the saving grace in this otherwise mediocre action film.I wouldn't necessarily be excited to watch this again, but based on the performance of Costner and Gadot I would recommend it.",Criminal
91,rusoviet,Acting was decent as it should be with that cast 'but'....,1,15 November 2018,.....both the xcript and especially the directing were predictable and pathetic. The worst was the phony 'sci-fi' taking someone's 'brain cells' and 'somehow' make another accept such 'in toto' to transform the 'other; into the 'donor'. (This is found out in the 1st 10 minutes of this lousy film).Costner plays a credible thug but Gary Oldham is mailing in his performance as I believe he would have readily agreed he had.They have the 'de rigeur' clown 'Russkies' who can't shoot straight nor steel enforce a chain link access gate. When they are confronted they slavishly choose to shoot at the threat (Costner) one at a time thus ensuring they're goners - on and on with the nonsense.Ga Godot looks really beautiful but the sappy ending is the crowning touch to what a piece of 'dawg exhaust' this thing is.,Criminal
92,pal05052003,A criminal is implanted with the memory of a dead CIA agent in hopes of stopping an imminent nuclear attack,8,13 August 2016,"This movie feels like a Bourne movie without Matt Damon and his martial arts. The intrigue and the gritty action makes it feel like it takes place in a Bourne movie-verse. It helps that there is a lot of talented cast. Kevin Costner was excellent despite my initial doubts. Tommy Lee Jones played a convincing doctor who cares about his patient. However, there is not much for Gary Oldman. He is basically Commissioner Gordon with more dialogue and running. A brief appearance by Ryan Reynolds also helped drive the plot a lot. His nice-guy character helped set the tone for Costner's character development during the movie. In fact, Kevin Costner carries the movie effortlessly. He is both menacing, and sensitive. His combination of brutality, and sensitivity makes him a close parallel to Damon's Jason Bourne and gives a certain freshness to the spy genre. Yet, it is too bad Scott Adkins did not get to do much. He is the reason I wanted to see the movie in the first place. But I think if he does his martial arts in the movie, it would detract too much from the story. However, he does have quite a presence in the movie. You always feel that this guy has something in him, and he is so serious. In short, criminal is a surprisingly good movie and its strength lies on its focus on the characters, and what drives them; especially Kevin Costner's character.",Criminal

I enjoyed the finesse in which the director was able to conduct the movie. Although I was startled by the movie at first, I really got to see what the director wanted to get across to the audience. He had a vision and it was well broadcasted. From the opening scene to the closing I was at the edge of my seat and completely entranced. I couldn't not see the finale of the film because I had previously got so invested in the process.PROS: The con is simple... ACTING! I don't understand how it is so hard to convey an emotion that the script has pretty much written out for you. You can't try to pull an emotion out of thin air, that's when it becomes unrealistic and shows through the film as being wicked fake.

He develops a totally believable and absolutely impeccable portrait of a sick psychopath who is greatly affected by an unapproved medical procedure. What is great is that he is not politically correct, weak, or conflicted. It makes him incredibly interesting in the age of weak males pandering to everyone. He gets to glimpse a normal life through the eyes of a strong man who is also moral which is the Ryan Reynolds character.

Agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is on his way to the Dutchman to complete the deal when he is killed. The CIA has Pope's memories installed into Jericho (Kevin Costner) a really bad guy, animal-like with no empathy for anyone. Will that operation turn Jericho into a good guy and find the Dutchman? (We can only hope) Let's find out. This will have you on your seat most of the time so find a good relaxing couch. The CGI and physical stunts along with the heart- pounding music will keep you awake and alert. The acting all around is excellent. We don't like seeing Jericho do the mean things he does, but we have to get over that and see (and hope) if Pope's memories take hold as Doctor Francis (Tommy Lee Jones) insists they will. The pacing is fast and furious almost like a Jason Bourne movie. What's not to like?There is one very big plot hole early on as Jericho escapes his CIA custody. Why didn't the CIA keep a closer eye on Pope's home to see if Jericho goes there? Had they done so they could have corralled Jericho quicker and made him comply with the mission he agreed to. Can the CIA be this inept? Let's find out. Things begin to turn, but not too quickly, for Jericho when he encounters Pope's wife Jill (Gal Gadot) and daughter Emma (Lara Decaro). Here the pacing slows down and we get to enjoy a friendlier Jericho. Will it last? Let's find out. We see CIA Chief Wells (Gary Oldman) constantly looking for Jericho and the Dutchman as both elude CIA surveillance. His blood pressure rises when he learns the Russians are now in contact with the Dutchman for the Wormhole and he cannot let the Russians get that program. There is a truly unexpected twist near the end when chief bad guy Xavier (Jordi Molla) jets away with the Wormhole. (Whaaat?)Over all this is an excellent thriller despite some minor plot holes. (There are others?) The action is fast and furious and we like it that way, but we also liked the scenes with Gal Gadot, Lara Decaro and Kevin Costner and these scenes were pure gold. In order to appreciate this movie we need to get over seeing Kevin Costner as a bad guy and hope beyond hope that he eventually turns into a good guy. Will he? Go find out. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

It is another adventure into ""fantasyland"" for thrillers, but what is new in that. The submarine shots and missile launches look nice but hen again there, nothing new.This is a 2 hour film that in my opinion, isn't worth the time. There are other films in this mode that are much better to spend time watching. I just saw it on DirecTV so at least I didn't have to open this much time and money in a theater to see this.",Criminal
107,Chiller7,"Has substance, needed more style",6,30 May 2016,"This is a competently made film, with a decent-enough story, and the interesting sci-fi premise of transferring memories from one person to another, with great performances, especially from Kevin Costner, but... it felt lacking in some ways that could have elevated it to being considered great. I think this is a case of a movie that has substance, but could have used some more style.Story: The real story here is not the beat-the-bad-guys and save-the-world plot, but rather it's the personal redemption arc of Kevin Costner's title criminal as he starts out as an all-around bad guy at the beginning, but transforms throughout the movie into someone we actually care for, because for the first time in his life, he possibly starts to care about others. It was actually pretty touching.Characters: The supporting cast (Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, etc.) is good, they serve their purposes, but Costner is the standout here as Jericho, gruff-voiced, physically intimidating despite his age, capable of brutal violence, but also witty sarcasm.In case it's not clear, by the way, Kevin Costner does not simply wake up thinking he's Ryan Reynolds after the memory transfer! Instead of ever completely turning into Ryan Reynold's character, he is only influenced by his memories - and that's what's interesting here, watching this guy struggle with whether to resist or accept those memories.The villains had minimal backstory or motive or personality, which unfortunately made them mostly uninteresting, which was a wasted opportunity, because this movie could have used some over-the-top villains, instead of the bland ones we got here. They should have taken some pages from Gary Oldman's past performances.Action: Here's where I wish the movie had a little more style. The action in this movie is best described as competent, but not better than that. There are moments when it's pretty good, especially the vehicle scenes, but I wanted more. I feel like a director with a more stylish sense of action, could have handled this movie better, like John Woo perhaps, or maybe the guys who made that John Wick movie.I mean, they got Scott Adkins in the cast, a talented acrobatic martial arts guy, but they don't even use him for any of that. Why not throw into the movie a couple of cool hand-to- hand combat fights? Costner can still handle it, I'm sure, as he shows in this movie, when he's given the chance. But I wanted more. Make good use of him before he gets too old!Final thoughts: I don't regret seeing it, but I'm not in a rush to recommend it to people, or to see it again, which is a shame, because there's some good stuff here, but it could have been better.",Criminal

The movie is more of an action thriller that keeps you curious from the alpha to omega!

Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones are also credible. Memory action films seem to have their own genre now. But this one uses real science, though somewhat of a leap, to give it credibility. It also asks the question and tries to answer, who we really are. Is it the Fromtal lobe of the brain and theta waves that determine good and evil? Are we the sum of our memories and experiences? Or is it all of the above? It does all this while still giving us a good action suspense plot. This review is probably the largest margin between the average reviewer and myself on this site.

They seemed to take that tagline to heart and decided to try to do that same thing, more or less. However, it is actually quite painful to watch. To steal a line from another movie, Tropic Thunder, ""never go full retard""; or in this case, never go full bad guy. The problem when you actually make the main character, supposedly a ""hero"", a genuinely bad person - you find yourself not wanting to root for them, and that was definitely the case in this film. Near the beginning there is one line of dialogue essentially explaining why Coaster does bad things, and this one line is supposed to create sympathy for the audience toward the main character - but it falls flat. They take the true ""good guy/hero"" (Reynolds) and then combine him into the same person as a true bad guy (Costner) - but not like a bad guy in Mel Gibson's Payback where you still find yourself liking/rooting for him - an actual bad guy you want to dislike. Beyond that, I'm not generally one to nit pick on plot hole issues; but there were some huge ones in this movie - it wasn't so much that I wanted things explained, it just made some things confusing and hard to follow. On the plus side, I did think the acting was all pretty good and all the production values were really good.

May be one of his best performances.Few things you got to ignore though. Like a little man Heimdahl with his single laptop could control and change anything while the whole CIA team cannot. He reaches to the spot much earlier than the CIA team every time. Many decisions of Quaker does not make any sense - for example releasing Jerico multiple times and go after him again realizing his blunder.Anyways, those are minor holes lost in a great flick. Satisfies every taste bud of yourself. The conflicts happening inside of Jerico perfectly portrayed by Costner. Jordi Mollà did great as the icy terrorist. Gary Oldman always shines in these kind of roles as CIA chief or something. Cameos of Tommy Lee Jones and Gal Gadot couldn't be better.

It's that bad.Just about everything else works very well though once you give the story the necessary free pass on its one impossible thing, the mind transference gimmick. In a supporting role Tommy Lee Jones is in Sympathetic Good Man mode, which he can do in his sleep better than any other actor wide awake, Costner proves that when he's being an actor instead of a Star he can put in an amazingly good performance, and everybody else, including the ruthless bad guy who nonetheless cares enough for his henchwoman to give her a pass when any other villain would have played the ""You have failed me for the last time"" card, and the terrified fugitive super-hacker who created and is carrying around the film's Maguffin, a piece of software code that makes whoever has it armageddon-capable, is good.(There's a wonderful little bit where Costner's character, still integrating the Reynolds character's memory, meets the bad guy unexpectedly, and says, as if recognizing a guy he saw at the pub the other day, ""You're the guy who killed me,"" to which the villain replies approvingly ""Good memory."")There's also a mid-air explosion that's so aesthetically beautiful that I stopped the film and watched it three times in a row, and I don't know what Alice Eve looks like when she gets up in the morning in real life, but backed by Hollywood make-up artists here she's unnaturally beautiful enough to play Aphrodite herself.Trivia note: this was Ryan Reynolds' second mind-transfer movie in two years: here he plays the donor; in 2015's ""Self/Less"" (also very good) he was the recipient.",Criminal

""Faceoff"" was a story about guys having their appearance changed to look like someone else, so they could pretend to be them. ""Criminal"" is about taking the residual memories from a dead guy and putting them in a live guy so they could learn what the dead guy knew and had done. What do these two stories having in common?? Nothing. If you must compare it to another movie, try Source Code (memories of a dead guy put in another deadish guy) or Star Trek Wrath of Kahn (Spock puts part of his conciousness in Bones). People who compare Criminal to Faceoff apparently failed to get the gist of either movie.
I really liked Criminal even though I'm not a big fan of in-your-face brutal violence. Costner does a great job of portraying a criminal psychopath who has zero concept of right and wrong. Badguy Jordi Molla and his girlfriend Antje Traueare are psychopaths who want to destroy governments . The supposedly good guy government agents are pretty brutal on their own. It's great fun watching Kevin Costner switch from unbridaled random viciousness to specific viciousness directed against the bad guys. Tommy Lee Jones was a decent, out of his usual character meekish doctor/scientist. Gal Gidot shows that she can do a hell of a lot of acting just by changing her expression. The kid was cute. This movie takes you on a wild ride from the depths of cruelty to the heights of love and caring, with a nice little twist near the end. The biggest downers for me was that Gary Oldman's character was just too repetitiously stupid to be believable and bad guys having no trouble tracking an experienced agent thru a busy crowed city.

124,lazyaceuk,Never was a film more aptly named,5,21 September 2019,"There are many guilty pleasures that can be gained from watching movies throughout your life. Moments that you want to go back to even within a dense calamity either side of those moments. Criminal doesn't provide many of them. There are jaw dropping moments but for all of the wrong reasons, not least why the screenwriters guild didn't have lawsuits pending for the levels of 'been there done that - better' that resulted from this film.There are moments of incredulity in this film which just confirm that sometimes actors just suck in their chests and pay the mortgage. This cast deserves better than what was presented to them. Saying that I like the tosh that screenwriter Cook served up in The Rock and Double Jeopardy. Here though, whether it was the inability of the Director or the lesser budget (Double Jeopardy was hardly a blockbuster) Criminal is a painful watch.In his youth Oldman played a number of crazy guys - Romeo is Bleeding,Leon - and clearly Costner used these as his template for this performance. I'm not exactly sure what template or method Oldman centered for his own performance here. The mainly British cast is given the job of playing the CIAs finest, all with the kind of American accents which when reversed annoys me as a Brit.And then there's Tommy Lee Jones. Poor Tommy. He plays his role as a man who is more concerned with managing his haemorrhoids as his emotions are a mixture of pain, pain and thoughts of getting a new agent.The set up that Costner has a spare space in his cerebral to take the memories of a dying CIA agent - Ryan Reynolds, cleverly exiting early enough from the mess - is Brain/Off rather than Face/Off. The clumsy chase through London and the British countryside and Costner's softening from hardened crim to almost family man in the space of 48 hrs is, criminal. The pay off between reformed bad guy and truly awful, I mean really awful as in poorly developed, bad guy is like opening a flat bottle of cola, even after you've shaken it for ten minutes.I gave it 5 stars mainly for the stunts and the decent performance by Gal Gadot.

His English doesn't sound like a Dutchie speaking English but a Russian, German at best, no way a Dutchie. And not being able to pronounce Jan Stroop the right way, unforgivable.

129,writeguyr,Modern day Frankenstein with a heart of gold,10,28 August 2016,"As bizarre as it may seem, Kevin Costner does play a role similar to a modern day Frankenstein monster. The film introduces Costner as wild man criminal Jericho Stewart as the bearded prisoner chained in a jail cell. He talks with a gruff voice with grunts. He is treated like the criminal monster he is. He has no real emotions, he has killed and injured people without anger or remorse. The reason that brings Government Honcho Quaker Wells (Gary Oldman) to Jericho's cell. They need to retrieve important memories of important national security information and transfer it into Jericho's accommodating skull in hopes of retrieving the info. Government agent Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) was killed while attempting to secure the important information from a secret contact called the Dutchman (Michael Pitt.) Wells wants Dr. Franks (yes similar to Dr. Frankenstein) portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones to perform the delicate brain operation on dead Pope retrieving the info and transferring from his still active brain, into the wild man beast's brain. Why Jericho? Seems his brain is the only choice that will accept memories since he has a rare brain malfunction. After the operation is completed there is not much change with Jericho he still seems like a wild monster brute. Yet he starts to have strange visions begin to flash through his brain, but can't decipher what they are. Which causes him much pain. Wells believing the operation to be a failure, gives the order to be transfer Jericho to someplace he could be terminated. However in transit Jericho, kills the security guards and makes good his escape. Once on the streets of the city Jericho unleashes his brutish violence upon anyone and everyone he runs into. He brazenly takes food from a fast food restaurant, daring anyone to interfere, just by his monstrous glare no one does a thing to stop him. Then Jericho steals a van by beating up the tough thug occupants. Suddenly the memories of Bill Pope become more clear and vivid in Jericho's mind. He sees images of Pope's gorgeous young wife Jill ( Gal Gadot) She has an angelic like beauty as she dances on a beach reaching out to her husband, yet it is Jericho who receives the enticing memory. Suddenly Jericho is no longer the brutish monster. He now can speak several foreign languages, he remembers security codes and highly classified information. The villainous character Xavier Heimdahl ( Jordi Molla) is also interested in Jericho, he wants to retrieve the information from Jericho to find the elusive secret contact Dutchman, who has the ability to take over nuclear weapons via his computer and launch them. The only thing to stop the Dutchman's countdown to launch is Bill Pope going to the Dutchman and paying him with a huge payoff. But with Pope dead it is now only Pope's memories in Jericho's head that could find the Dutchman that will save the world. Xavier and Wells are hoping that Pope's memory transferred into Jericho's mind could be the key. Xavier sends his army of thugs to retrieve Jericho. When Wells discovers that Jericho's mind is recalling the important data he also sends agents to retrieve Jericho. Jericho on the run, goes to Bill Pope's home. He remembers the code to open the security system for the front door. Once inside something strange happens to the brute Jericho. As he finds Jill lying in bed, the images of her tender beauty from her husband flash through his mind. Even as he tapes her to the bed, you can see his mind fighting to calm the beast within himself. He gently touches her bare leg, steals a few items then leaves. Now the Jericho before his operation would have raped and sexual assaulted and killed the helpless Jill. Yet something miraculous has happened to Jericho for the first time in his life Jericho VIA Bill Pope's memories has felt tenderness and caring. Later during an escape from Xavier's thugs Jericho is seriously wounded. He is found in the Pope's basement by Jill who has a gun trained upon him. As he patches up his bleeding leg he looks up at her with a calm sentimental expression. He then says to her ""Your husband could never hurt you and neither could I"" Then he tells her all about the memory transfer from her dead husband, and that he can recall all of his memories and all of his feelings. Now Jill's fear vanishes she has now a caring curious look on her face. Could she actually be communicating with her dead husband through Jericho? Then when she sees her young daughter Emma (Lara Decaro) teaching this once monster brute Jericho with scars on the back of his head like the Frankenstein monster to play the piano. She and her daughter take him into their hearts and he also cares for them. There is of course for the action fans a big climax shoot out that has Jericho risking his life for Jill and her daughter, something he would have not ever have done at the beginning of this film. I like the ending twist plot that is so rewarding as is the finale.A truly magnificent; film, acting, directing and screenplay. One of the best films I have seen in a long time. Costner should get an Academy Award nomination for his acting here. And Gal Gadot should have the name Gal Goddess. She is just a stunningly beautiful actress. I liked her as Wonder Woman in Batman vs Superman, and I love her in this film. Definitely a future super star actress with immense talent and beauty. This is a film you should see!!!",Criminal

As this is happening he gets a call from his wife; we learn we're supposed to like this guy. Next he gets chased. Then he dies.But wait! What at first seemed like an average action flick now takes a different turn. This flick is high concept... or so we were told. What is promoted as the ""high concept"" of this thriller, is in fact no more than an excuse to stretch the runtime of this movie to almost two hours. It is also far from inventive, but far fetched and slightly ridiculous: they put the memories of the dead operative into the brain of a death row inmate played by Kevin Costner. So after a redundant operation scene, followed by an excess of scenes where Costner is figuring out what's happening to him, the movie that started as an fast moving espionage flick becomes a gritty, dawdling, Bourne-Identity-meets-You-Were-Never-Realy-Here movie.Now, I'm in for mindless action and I'm also down for gritty human drama's, but if you're going to mix the two it should at least be done in a way that fits the tone. And if you really want to glue the two together with over the top science fiction, then make an over the top movie and not one with an overly serious tone.The biggest problem this movie has, however, is the fact that it takes half the runtime for us to even be introduced to what's really at stake. The fact that there is both a personal ánd an international plot unraveling doesn't help and makes us wonder why we should feel any tension at all. Why were we rooting for Costner again? Oh, that's right, he's playing the bad guy that is discovering his nice side. Super high-concept...The technical execution of the movie (camera, lighting, special effects...) is decent, yet average.

As Jericoh (Kevin Costner) progressively gets more involved with Pope's sentimental memories (feelings of love and kindness), he also develops a sensitivity for humanity: he develops positive emotions. And of course we empathize with JEricoh when we learn the cause of his brain damage--his father throws him off the window of a running car...this marked him forever. I also love how Pope's wife (Gadot) connects with this ""criminal,"" because he carries her deceased beloved husbands memories and feelings. Likewise, Pope's daughter bonds with Jericoh. And the emotional climax of the movie is my favorite part! It's a moment of truth and tears. Another thing I liked was the Russian hacker (Michael Pitt) that have taken control of nuclear missiles system--in the end, he sabotages the system and prevents the wicked Spaniard (Molla, the real villain of the film) to carry out destruction. The science-fiction portion of the story is such an mind-opener! Can people with no ability to distinguish between good and evil be saved? What if they are exposed to the neural pathways/memories of goodness, of kindness? What if they experience these positive emotions and can then make a choice? This is what Jericoh does. He doesn't automatically turns good, he makes the choice to turn good, because he discovers something he has never experience before, thanks to Pope's memories. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when he tells Gadot he couldn't ever harm her because Pope would never do so. After that moment, Gadot overcomes her fear. Pope's goodness has reflected on Jericoh, and Jericoh has accepted that. I also love Tommy Lee Jones as Dr. Frank! Just love him. AND THE ENDING? Fantastic! I wanted to stay in that moment forever! A shining Kevin Costner.2. The ugly and terrible: Seeing Kevin Costner commit such heinous acts of violence without a trace of emotion in his face is hard to watch. Of course his brain is impervious to emotion or the sense of good vs. evil. Hence that's why he becomes the perfect target for Dr. Frank's experiment. But it's Kevin Costner! Our sweetheart wonderful good-guy actor. Also, Pope(Reynolds) suffers a brutal death...that's hard to watch (or hear).3. What I ponder about: Lots of layers, lots of elements going on. But the whole idea of this Spaniard anarchist having such level of power. He doesn't operate on a global scale or doesn't seem strong enough to have such impact.Overall, this is a film with a positive message. I walked out of the theater feeling good! Give it a try!",Criminal

His sensibility and gravitas make for interesting characters, like in this crime drama; the story gets right into it as Oldman does what he used to better do in ""Léon: The Professional"" (1994). Costner visibly jars up his act to embody a careless and violent son of a bitch with no moral restraints, but it gets to be more believable as things develop. And you wind up rooting for him too, since you see him as a redeemable victim of bad circumstances. It's really in Costner's balanced portrayal, since fancy biotech stuff is common movie fare.",Criminal

That he is always one step behind doesn't help too. Could someone so incompetent and with such poor human interaction skills rise up so high in any bureaucratic organisation? A tad over-acting on his part perhaps?Other than that, the film was very good...until the end.I wish they left Jericho the way he was...let the memory fade and everyone goes back to their lives as before...forcing a 'happy' ending is the weak link in the plot. What is she suppose to do with him now? Or him with his new identity, for that matter?It is sci-fi...not a fairy tale...making one little girl happy took so much from the plot that it didn't make sense to me. Even showing that he didn't relate to the little girl at the end and the guy in the jeep had to put Jericho down would be a better (more realistic)ending...Nevertheless...I enjoyed the movie and would recommend my friends to watch it.

All does not go to plan however, and it's a chase for the CIA to get the information before the crime lord Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Mollà) does.Tommy Lee Jones makes a good job of playing Dr Franks and it's nice to see Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) as Pope's widow.The movie takes a little while to really get going but stick with it, although a bit clichéd, there is plenty of action and it's a descent watch.",Criminal

Especially in the middle of the film when there were those 'tender moments' with the family of the character of Ryan Reynolds. I didn't like the character of Kevin Costner either.

142,athawolsux,A good movie almost ruined by modern action movie clichés,4,6 May 2016,"It is hard to argue that Criminal is a very good movie. In fact, in my opinion it starts off pretty terrible, incorporating all the clichés of mediocre fast-paced action / spy flicks down to agents doing stuff on high-tech computer screens, people getting tracked and scene shifts with the typical modern ""action movie font"" introducing cities and characters.However, it gets much better once Jerico (Costner) enters the picture. Bolstered by a really good performance by Costner, all the scenes featuring the character are pretty fun to watch. This could be a much better and interesting movie if it mostly only followed Costner at a slower pace, exploring the conflict he faces regarding his newfound emotions and ""family.""Unfortunately, in the movie this potential is smothered by cliché after cliché and poor cinematography, overall offering a pedestrian effort that manages to shine through the tropes from time to time.",Criminal
143,geraldohanna,Face/Off and Self/Less had a lovechild and its name is...,6,23 June 2016,"In a failed attempt to retrieve a CIA agent (Ryan Reynolds, ""Deadpool"") who has intel on an industrialist-turned-anarchist Heimdahl (Jordi Mollà) The CIA are forced to implant the memories of the now deceased agent into Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner, ""McFarland, USA"") who in turn struggles with the memories and complexities of being a good man. This is the second collaboration between Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, and Gary Oldman following the 1991 film JFK. Hard to believe that it took us 26 years to put these three talented actors together again, and although I would have like to have seen them in a film like JFK; Criminal does hold its own in some merit. Director, Ariel Vromen made his English directorial debut with 2012's The Iceman. With this film, he showed us that he could handle a little budget thriller with a talented lead (Michael Shannon) and shape it into a watchable thriller that whether critics loved it or hated it - It would definitely make him a household name to talk about. Again he works his magic here with Criminal, under the writing talents of Douglas S. Cook & David Weisberg (""The Rock"", ""Double Jeopardy"") who borrow the shared plot device from ""Face/Off"" & ""Self/Less."" If you hated those films then maybe you will hate this film as well, although it does differ in some way adding an anarchist for the baddie. Ryan Reynolds is a pleasure to see for the time spent with him, who coincidentally previously starred in last year's ""Self/Less."" Gal Gadot taking a break from ""Dawn of Justice"" is captivating as a now single mother forced to handle this new found information. Oldman and Jones rarely have much to do which is sad considering their talent. But the real star would be Costner although he does nothing special in the film. It's fun to see him play a character different from what we are normally subjected to among the lines of (""3 Days to Kill"") While Criminal does have enough star talent to break the bank and send people rushing to the theaters - You'll have to determine if the film if worth remembering the minute you leave.",Criminal

There is less of Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman than one would have liked, but they're aptly cast and show the good performances you'd expect from them. But I want to point your attention to Costner's acting. If I told you in advance what kind of character he plays, you would expect something familiar from experience - but it's not exactly what you get. Costner does much more with the role than expected. His character is multi-faceted: A mixture between brutal animal, a bit of a mentally challenged person and some traits he 'inherits' through the film's core procedure. And Costner knows what to do with that. He brings the torn character to screen in a gripping way.

After several weeks of searching for a decent movie to go see, I came across this one. Thank goodness it was not a movie with nothing but CGI to hold it together. Before I decided to write my review, I looked over some of the reviews. Obviously the norm nowadays when reviewing a movie is to nit pick it to death. First of all, I enjoyed this movie. It started right off the bat involving you in the movie and making you think. The story was different and interesting. Using a really, really bad guy and turning him into a hero took some doing, but I think it came off very well. Just when you thought you had it figured out, there came another twist to the plot. Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones and Ryan Reynolds were excellent in their roles. Overall, a good movie. I would recommend this movie. If you enjoy a movie with a good storyline, then this is for you. I would add this one to my DVD collection. Forgo any reviews and critics' reviews and make up your own mind. Enjoy.",Criminal

Boy was it disappointing. The story is ... well really stupid.. but its an action flick.. so we can go along with it in the name of fun.... but the film is very very frustrating to watch. I don't know what Ariel was thinking.. Did he make his mark in music videos or something? The full use of hand-held cameras and the constant movement make sure that the picture is jittery and blurred throughout. A very lazy and cheap approach to film making. It can really ruin a film. If you couple the hand held camera aspect with the way it is cut with extreme closeups in practically every shot, you end up with a film that is extremely frustrating to watch. I have seen enough of Kevin Costner's nose hair. :-)Very few shots last more than 3-4 seconds. Every shot is an extreme closeup, and very jittery and constantly moving.. Arrrrgh.. I kept noticing how much the film resembled the previews shown before movies. Previews are teasers, with very quick flashes of video. But they aren't the full film. This movie is essentially an hour and a half of a preview video. If you can endure it, along with the stupid stupid ridiculous story, you might have a decent time.",Criminal

Costner has become an action hero somehow ala mr.Neeson. Mr.Costner plays the same role as the postman,and the wonderful Mr. Brooks. I have always thought of him as a good actor. The cast for this film was good, but somehow i kept thinking they were keeping their contractual obligations. It is a well crafted movie and nice soundtrack. But i kept thinking of it as a jason bourne redux. Instead of losing his identity and saving the world. He has gained an identity to do the same. You can write an essay comparing the parallel narrative of the two story lines. It was a linear story, good guys tries to get the bad guys, a western with automatic weapons and elongated tubular objects thrusting up into the clouds. It wasn't really a waste of time, not much to it, it was entertaining. Sort of like watching football, basketball, hockey etc.",Criminal
153,mattslim333,Criminally underrated,7,17 April 2016,"Criminal has been slated in most reviews I've read, so I went into this film expecting very little from it. However, the film is actually considerably better than these reviews suggest and has some clever ideas running through it. It's all about the memories of Bill Pope, played by Ryan Reynolds, being transferred into Jericho Stewart, played by Kevin Costner. Both actors do well with what they are given, and Costner is particularly impressive when he has to deal with his own thoughts and Pope's as well. This memory transplant is done so a task can be completed, and you'll understand why if you watch the film. The start of the film is very intense and really pulls in your interest, with a selection of plots being introduced and I felt they all connected quite nicely at the end. The script is a bit lacklustre and uses swearing for effect rather than proper character development, although this isn't totally lacking, as Stewart tries to connect with Pope's family, which develops the story and characters quite nicely.The action sequences provide nothing new or inventive to the genre, but they are well done and they always feel like a payoff for decent storytelling. The primary issue I had with Criminal is the middle section, which becomes very lacklustre and slow, and to be honest is a bit boring. I know most films slow down at some stage, but this one lost my interest a bit, which is never a good sign. We get to see a lot of Gel Gadot here, and she plays a good part and acts well alongside Costner. However the film picks up again with a pretty good final third, although again, nothing new is shown and the action is slightly generic. The film ends well, and the clever principles of this film are not lost through the seen it all before action scenes.So overall, Criminal is film with clever ideas but has generic action sequences which does not merit these ideas, despite the action being entertaining. The acting is good, but the script is lacklustre and the middle section is slow. Criminal is worth a watch, but it won't win any awards despite it being a decent crack at the action film genre.",Criminal
154,danaelambros,Kevin Costner's best role since Dances with Wolves,8,15 August 2016,"Yes, there are some implausible elements to the plot, but this film is really about redemption, and certainly this is a true come-back role for Kevin Costner. It's too bad this film didn't receive wider distribution or a larger viewing audience. I've often felt that Costner has been misunderstood over the past two decades by film goers and movie producers alike. He really is a fine actor and living proof that actors do become better with age... Most of the supporting cast, with the exception of Gal Godot, were just average, given they didn't have much to work with because of the limitations of the script. That being said, I enjoyed this film and it has much to offer thematically speaking. It certainly deserved a better rating that what's been given here on IMDb. Costner is at his crusty best in the lead role, and has truly broken the mold of his former ""good guy"" roles. If you're a spy or thriller fan, enjoy the twists and turns of the plot, then just sit back and enjoy the ride. Criminal is a very satisfying film on several levels.Two thumbs up for Kevin Costner!",Criminal

Yes, it feels like a cousin of Face/Off. Yes, there are tremendous conveniences in the story. Yes, it is predictable. However, if you like the cast and if you like action movies with some surprises then it is worth seeing. Costner brings his star power to the role of Jericho, a man with no social skills due to his underdeveloped frontal lobes, which were damaged as a child (in a touching story). Therefore it's fun to watch him steal a vehicle right in front of people, walk to the front of lines and punch people just because he can. I was happy to see Gal Gadot in a bigger role than I expected. And I spent most of the movie trying to figure out who one of the villains was, as I recognized her from another role but couldn't place it. She is very distinctive (and very beautiful), and at the end I realized it was Antje Traue, the East German actress who played a super villain in 2013's Man of Steel.

156,nyrn,Bourne... again.,5,1 January 2017,"The Dutchman, Jericho, Wormhole and the Russians. This euro-thriller is likely to bore you to death with its clichés, but hey, sprinkle with a few old-timers and we're all good? As per usual, there's no venting fake reviews by IMDb, one-time reviewer 'kevjoyce-41340' not only used the words 'perfect', 'brilliant' and 'flawless' in once sentence, but also gave the film a 10/10 rating. I'd say that's pretty much what this movie isn't. Instead it's a slightly confusing amalgamation of equal parts Bourne – the last boring one, mind you – Die Hard and Face-Off, but with a handful unfunny and overly violent scenes added. Criminal tries hard to be extremely badass, but without the smarts and flair of the many movies it stole from.Story aside, there isn't much excitement in the actor department either. Kevin Costner is not all that bad, but Gary Oldman and Tommy-Lee Jones are both seriously past their expiration dates, and with Ryan Reynolds continuing to be nothing more than a face. 'Bland' is the word here. A few cringe-worthy scenes comes to mind, like when Costner take down four guys at a fastfood joint, grabs a vehicle and starts jamming to the radio. Or 'blending in' by dressing epicly gangster whilst punching a random guy in the face – the kind of overacting reserved for melodrama queen Nicolas Cage. Or maybe Travolta in Swordfish (2001).Other than that, the movie is shot well, has its fair share of action scenes and also includes a few interesting people like Scott Adkins and Amaury Nolasco. Unfortunately, none of whom get the chance to shine this time. No doubt there are some good actors in Criminal, but it leaves you questioning if the film hadn't been better off with a tailor-made script for just one of them. I'm giving Criminal a 5 out of 10.

The summary sounded interesting, so I recorded it to watch later. I have to say, Kevin Costner did a fantastic job as Jerico, the animalistic monster who gets a memory transplant. He presented a mixed personality. I could always tell when he was just Jerico, and when he was Jerico/Bill. He never became completely Bill, unless you count the scenes where he used Bill's skills. On the other hand, Gary Oldman's character, Quaker, was always annoying to me. He reminded me of my view of adults when I was a child. He was always jumping to conclusions, and they were almost always wrong. I get that he wanted to get control of the Dutchman's wormhole as quickly as possible, but whenever he thought he was about to get it, he would order Jerico's demise. Lucky for him, Jerico was good at escaping. He finally figured out Jerico by the end of the film, and we got a happy ending. Of course, Jerico was not going to end up in a romantic relationship with Bill's wife, but looks like he will end up with Bill's job. Great ending.

(The exact nature of the villain's situation. Whether or not it would be in what kind of vehicle and in what way.)Another reviewer complained about overuse of jiggly cam, and I concur. But it's bearable. It's far removed from the shaky-cam insanity that put all Paul Greengrass and Olivier Megaton movies on my blacklist.I would say that the film's worth watching for the streaks of good acting, fun and interesting situations, and of course Gal Gadot's scene stealing beauty (Is she single?). But once the credits rolled, I could only shake my head about how phoned-in (yet well produced) this crap of a movie is.

163,cougarfan-bridger,"Unemotional, Overlong Thriller",3,24 April 2016,"In Criminal, Kevin Costner plays Jerico Stewart, a sociopath, who feels no empathy, emotion or regret. Imprisoned as a violent criminal, he is given a second chance when a CIA operative is killed in action, and ""transplanting"" his memories into Jericho's head could be the only way to complete the mission. In a cast full of talent such as Gary Oldman and Tommy Lee Jones, Costner's portrayal of Jerico is over the top, unnecessarily brutal and slightly moronic. Don't get your hopes up about the rest of the cast either, they do little to shine. Tommy Lee Jones is used sparingly in his role of a doctor who provides little to the story outside of performing the surgery, yet somehow is deemed important enough to tag along the rest of the film. Gary Oldman's character also probably has some psychological issues as well, and it feels as though his only purpose is to drive the nonexistent story line with his impatient mistakes. Overall, Criminal fails to deliver any emotional moments, provides poor characters who I was never able to relate to, and quite frankly, never even liked. I never fully decided whether or not I was supposed to root for this violent, blood thirsty beast or if he was intended as the antagonist. The most disappointing aspect of the film is that it is based on the very interesting, thought provoking subject of transferring memories, and the morality of such actions. Never once did they question should they be doing this, or what kind of adverse effects it could have on society. A bland and stereotypical script fails to delve into what could have made this a very thoughtful and enjoyable film.",Criminal

Apparently however, if the race happens to be Russian, all bets are off.As long as the western establishment... well, ""establishes"", that hating Russians, Putin, and just about everything and everyone else who is associated with Russia is okay, then, voila! Perfectly fine. Ah why not, right? The news media says Russia and Putin are bad so it MUST be true.I wonder how difficult it would be to convince mainstream society that East Asian children have been conspiring to take over the world due to all the sneakers they collectively have had stolen from them by innocent jogging enthusiasts? I will bet dollars to donuts that every person who reads this review will agree that mainstream media along with Hollywood and pretty much all information resources available through the internet and TV, lie. Yet still, while agreeing with that statement, many will still agree that Russia is the bad guy and Putin is evil. What irony! What paradox! It's like saying, ""I know snakes bite but I can't just not take that cobra home with me and let my kid roll around with it."" How does this relate to the movie? Pure racist anti-Russian garbage and propaganda. Typical ""'murica good, Russia bad"" filth. I would hope that in this day and age when we can easily realize about mainstream internet giants blocking our abilities to know the facts, that every single day people are also realizing that it is America and the western media and propaganda that are the bad guys, and definitely (!!!) not Russia, and certainly not its president. In fact, they are about the last stand between good and evil in this world today as it sits.This movie however, makes it a point to continue to force the lies about Russia down the collective throats of whoever watches it. For that reason alone the story was ruined for me. Had they, for instance, made 'murica the bad guy for JUST ONCE (Mary and Joseph!), I would have said okay, realistic story line. But nooo.

Really enjoyed it.,9,25 November 2018,"As the lead was Kevin Costner I skipped this movie when it came out as I thought it would be the usual- one dimensional bad guy comes syrupy good. It's not like that at all and so much the better for it. Once you get past the 'science' and just go along for the ride, I was transfixed by Costners character. That doesn't happen too often for me when watching movies, I was so impressed by his performance. Negatives- the bad guy was forgettable.",Criminal

I saw it, and immediately came to mind my mind another movie Face/Off. This one the story is somewhat similar, to frustrate an extortion plot, an agent dies and his memories, secrets, and as well his skills are implanted into someone else, a casted away death-row criminal; all they hoped was for this man to finish the dead agent mission Yes, Ryan Reynolds again, I think he does have some kind of difficult in choosing his roles, you could say it again, a talent that slowly is being wasted On the other hand, Kevin Costner tries really hard to play a badass criminal, but the result was something like his role in Robin Hood, goodness grace, give me a brake Anyhow, overall it isn't such a bad movie, like I said, pure entertainment, with a good taste of location, and a very well elaborated shots sequence",Criminal
167,baqari-com,What's with Ryan Reynolds and mind transfer movies?,7,22 April 2016,"I mean seriously? First Self/Less and now this? In first one mind was transfered in his body...And now his mind is transfered to the other guy? Come on man...Okay enough of this, let's get to the movie. Sci-fi genre has been developing awhile now. In 90's the peek of it's development was time space-travel(2001 Space Odyssey) and cybernetic organisms(Terminator). In 2000's it was an emotionless society(Equilibrium) and of course The Matrix. In 2010's the directors have begun to tackle with ideas like human mind transfer and gravity. The latter has been explored in a glorious way through Interstellar. But the first one not so much...The last couple of years have presented us a number of movies about mind transfer: Transcendence; self/less and our current matter - Criminal. All three of these movies had some portion of action and drama in it. And all three of them weren't met with high praises. Why?The idea of mind transfer itself is a complex matter. Even in science theory it's hard to imagine it becoming a reality. But why can't they make it work in science fiction...?About Criminal i'll say that this movie was anticipated, but met pretty critically. The film opened couple of doors that weren't meant to even be in the movie like this one. The performances were good and crime + action in the movies description were decent. But the sci-fi element, which should be more important for the film was left out to leave room for drama. And i'd say it worked...in a way. We fell more connected to the characters this way, but the movie doesn't deliver, especially because you can1't shake a feeling that something like this can actually happen.So if you wanna see Deadpool marry Wonder Woman, than die and leave her to mercy of Joseph Kent, who really doesn't like to work for commissioner Gordon, than this movie is for you.But you can absolutely spend two hours watching it. 7/10",Criminal

I was pretty much expecting that it would be a boring star vehicle type of movie, but it was definitely not, due to the excellent acting and overall quality and atmosphere of this film.The story begins with the transplanting of memories and emotions from a dead CIA agent's (Ryan Reynolds) brain into the brain of a death row prisoner (Kevin Costner). While a procedure such as this is still a bit far fetched, this movie actually pulls it off and makes it believable.Kevin Costner's excellent acting is a huge reason that this movie works. As I watched this movie, several times I had to remind myself that this was Kevin Costner: he completely fused himself with the character of Jericho.Filmed in and around London, this movie has the feel of an intense foreign-made thriller, but with popular American actors.I have no idea how this movie was marketed when it was released, but maybe that has something to do with it's relative obscurity and low box office.Criminal is a very good movie worth viewing, even if like myself, you didn't even know it existed.",Criminal
171,daparry,Frantic action in search of a plausible plot,4,6 December 2020,"This is a mix of sci-fi and today's world, and it simply does not work. The basic premise of being able to read a dead man's memory is ingenious, but simply not plausible. I might have accepted it if they had read the memory from a dying man. Buit this, superimposed on action that takes place in today;s Britain, is just the first problem with the plot. It might have worked if i had been set a decade or two in the future.So what is the problem with the plot? It must have been written by an American, because it has all the American cliches about the British police; that they are unarmed, slow and stupid. Puhleez. The script expects us to believe that a private company can send armed killers who hose the unwanted with submachine guns. Cone on. A burst of automatic fire, and the rapid response unit would be out there in a matter of minutes, armed to the teeth. As usual, a killing here or there gets no reaction from the police, and of course nobody thinks of ringing up the police if they are in danger.The plot is actually more in the James Bond league, with a ""out hero saves the world"" schtick that is a cyberwarfare version of Thunderball. Some hacker has found out how to launch nuclear missiles from various locations, even from a submarine. (Face palm) Uh, no.The film has a stellar lineup and great acting. The direction is good, if somewhat routine. There is an awful lot of deja vu in most action films, and this is unfortunately no exception. In short; a pity about the plot.",Criminal

However he has only a small part in the movie. The movie is flat with nothing exciting throughout. Good cast and some good production value in an emotionally dissatisfying and a dull movie with poorly executed good storyline.Lots of chaos but no intelligent action scene anywhere. There was no action choreography at all and most of all the movie is full of cliches. There is absolutely no police while people are fighting all over the place.

I saw that this movie had a good cast so I gave it a shot.Lets just say that I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it again on the proper screen after my flight for a better experience.Below are the main reasons I gave this movie 9/10The cast: Gary Oldman, Keven Costner, Tommy Lee Jones should I say more?The plot: Simple, easy to follow and super entertaining. But most importantly as Jerico (Kevin Costner) develops the memory of Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) I was kept on my seat because I had no idea what Jerico was going to do next and how his character will slowly change as the film progresses. Moreover there was so much at stake!Acting: The dialog isn't that great. But Kevin Costner blew me away with his performance. All of the other cast members also did a phenomenal job.This movie really reminded me of the 90's action movies such as ""Face-Off"".

Yet, I did the research and it's science in the making. It has worked on rats, as quoted in the movie.Costner's character made me laugh, wince, smile, cry, laugh and smile again. He plays the villain and the hero to a tee. Oldman's last line gives me the idea there may be a sequel and I will be first in line to watch Costner strut his stuff once again.Love the London locations and British references, but I may be bias having been born and raised there.Have not come across this director before but is reminiscent of McG and Luc Besson. Was quite sure one or the other had a hand in this movie until the credits. Give it a go lovers of Besson and McG.

If you wondering whether to watch it, you should since it does have some good scenes that were even better in the trailer, but the movie needed more of it since I was hoping for a little more by other reviews and watching the trailer. I was expecting for it to be intense but it was slightly off just a little bit on my expectations. Overall though I thought it was a good film, great actors, acceptable and satisfying plot.

192,LowTekGuy,It must have sounded so...not awful in the pitch meeting.,4,18 April 2016,"No one objects to a big star like Kevin Costner playing his ""aging-actor-career-extension"" card, right? So what if Liam Neeson called and wants his gravelly vocal delivery back? Not even Mickey Rourke would ask for the return of the haircut. **mild spoilers ahead**The screenplay tries to skate along a Bourne-type action path, with just enough sci-fi-ish novelty to support a catchy tag line and get financing. Unfortunately the result is criminal for audience and actors alike. The evidence:Gary Oldman, as Special Agent in Charge of Everything That Happens in Europe, is made to say and do more foolish, self- defeating, contradictory, openly stupid things than any actor should ever be saddled with.Tommy Lee Jones plays a medical genius named Dr. What Movie Are We Shooting. His job seems to be to show that someone has a SAG card with more sags than Mr. Costner's. Both the good and the bad guys have laptops and wall-screens that show perfectly framed video of everything that is happening in all places, public and private, except for the agent's home where the World's Most Wanted Man is hanging out for long stretches. About halfway through, the guy who can launch any US nuke at any moment decides he doesn't want that capability to fall into the wrong hands after all. Maybe just give it to the Russians.Either the production tried to save money by eliminating all use of tripods and dollies or someone kept bumping into the cameraman a LOT.Finally there's Kevin Costner, whose head aches horribly because he is holding the intelligence of two separate people in his brain at once. They both should have turned down the role. It's hard to believe the people who wrote this screenplay once wrote The Rock. Welcome to the action movie business of today--where good writing is not welcome, but big stars compromise themselves just to keep their hand in the game, and pray for a couple of quality acting moments per flick. Faint Praise Dept.: Everyone plays it straight here, and while the actors look confused about their motivations on a moment- by-moment basis, they really aren't just mailing it in. in fact, Gary Oldman may actually be trying to have fun (but I'm not certain about that). Like its main character, this film wants to be bad-ass, not simply bad. But if it does get a sequel, that would be Criminal, too.",Criminal

196,Rawin1981,Mixed but very watchable thriller.,5,4 June 2016,"No spoilers if you've seen the trailer (oh and the trailer really is one of those where if you've seen it, then you've seen all the best bits).Criminal on paper looks like a safe bet, it's produced by super 'B' movie producer Avi Lerner (Olympus/London has fallen, Expendables) has an A list cast and a much worn premise, along the lines of Face Off or Ryan Reynolds lukewarm thriller from 2015 Self/less, involving body/mind swap sci-fi, while being set in a present day surrounding.The premise, Reynolds young spy has his memory's implanted into Kevin Costners gruff, violent criminal by Dr Tommy Lee Jones, overseen by mostly shouty Spy boss Gary Oldman, to stop some bad men doing bad things with hacking and missiles. Costner's criminal escapes and goes on a bit of a rampage through London whilst also wrestling his own violent nature against Reynolds softer character traits seeping through (so basically he's got a bit of a split personality going on).In other words it's a silly high concept plot line to effectively have Costner run around a city, beat up some bad guys, get into shoot outs, chases and save the day.He also along the way tracks down Gal Gadot who is Reynolds wife, and by far the best at delivering anything near a believable character, followed by Tommy Lee Jones (in a very restrained role) in a very mixed bag of a movie.The film was made for around 30 million dollars, so don't expect much big blockbuster action, although the few car chases and explosions there are, are done decently, the film still at times feels quite cheap. The pace is a little off as well as its a bit of a slog and feels longer than it should at times.In terms of tone it's violent, full of bad language, and seems to think both of those pass as humour, they don't in the context they are used in this film and are frankly pretty misjudged.The performances vary, by far the worst being Gary Oldman who whilst normally excellent simply feels like he's in another film altogether at times, he literally shouts his scenes of dialogue at times when it seems a quieter authority would have been better suited.As for leading man Costner, he's playing a pretty unlikeable fella here, so you would expect the filmmakers to try and inject some charm for an audience to sympathize or grow some kind of emotional attachment, but no Costner simply grunts and swears through most scenes in a gruff lazy drool, he's watchable as always but doesn't have much to work with here, though they do try to have him form a Bond with mother and child later on its quite late in proceedings.There's some good touches, Gal Gadot brings out a softer side of Costner's character, there's a decent mix of Electro music and the film score used is atmospheric, some of the visuals are decent, shots of London for example and the action scenes whilst only short bursts are clear to see and not confusing and finally there's the thriller plot aspect of the story that plays like a standard spy/action thriller as our (anti) hero must set out to stop the villains and save the girl.In closing, mixed performances, misplaced serious tone with violent outbursts of humour, some decent action but a bit of misguided film, watchable, not terrible but quite frustrating given the fact there's a better movie in there that could of got out.3 out of 5.",Criminal

The thing I like best about it is that the movie - despite all the action, and gory action at that - is really all about people. People and personalities and knowing good vs evil and wrong from right...and how a person can know wrong from right, and then cherish that knowledge once one sees it. If it was a book it would be a page turner.I was disappointed that few people were in the theater, and I can only speculate that most of the main actors are...what, too old to draw in the crowd? If so, that's sad, because this one is really worth seeing. Even buying a copy to keep.And Kevin Costner deserves an Oscar.",Criminal
206,kevjoyce-41340,Mr Costner.... WOW,10,25 April 2016,"This is my first ever review of a movie and boy what movie.The cast is perfect, the setting is brilliant. The story flawless (if you let yourself go with it)First of all let me say that Mr Costner has proved beyond a shadow of a doubt he is one of the greatest actors of this or any generation. His performance is powerful, stirring and just plain amazing. I would never of thought he could portray a character like this. This is not the man from Robin Hood.. far from a Field of Dreams and so much more than a Waterworld. The pace never lets up and you will find yourself shocked, stunned , cheering, laughing and wincing in equal measure. All parts are played by cast brilliantly and with conviction. The action sequences do not feel like set pieces but more like a fluid progression of the plight of the main character. Gal Godot is beautiful in this movie, frail and torn and you can see it, I mean really see it. Ms Gabot is proving to be far more than a pretty face (not that I only thought that) Ryan Renolds is on key as usual in a familiar kind of role. At one point (i'll let you figure which part I mean) my heart breaks for the man. Gary Oldman is frantic and who can blame him , also brilliantly done. I'm not going to dissect the movie as I'm sure many will but only say be prepared for a movie that will draw you in and keep you hooked until the very end and then have you begging for the movie to be longer. Down to direction, location, stunts, sfx BRAVO !! I'm not sure if this is a movie that will be looked upon as Oscar worthy (it should be) but for the sake of common sense and justice to a great performance, Mr Kevin Costner take a bow and I hope beyond hope that you get the recognition you deserve for this movie... Outstanding !!!!! P.S sorry if my grammar offends (or amuses) :)",Criminal
207,khouloudkhadr,Could have been a great movie,4,18 April 2016,"During the whole length of the movie I've been extremely frustrated knowing that this could have turned out a great movie since it has a good idea for a plot yet endlessly many mistakes, situations that don't make sense, ridiculous script and sometimes funny acting making it the worst movie of the year for me and one of the stupidest I've ever watched. A senior CIA figure panicking all the time and losing his nerves, giving up on a piece of potentially world saving information after 3 minutes of trying, not being able to follow the recommendations of the ONLY scientist in the world who knows anything about this ""experiment"" yet at the end of the movie taking all the time on the world to blame another one of the main characters while security people are rushing them to evacuate the place asap for fear of their lives; having a serial killer braking into my house and not changing the security code after, seeing the same serial killer in my house and not calling the police, the CIA having powerful surveillance systems able to locate subjects in seconds yet when it doesn't serve the plot they take ages to do so; the whole movie is just so flawed, ridiculously directed; it has done so much damage to the image I have of 3 of my favorite and top Hollywood stars; I'll never be able to watch them in any movie again without remembering this fiasco. 2 of the ""foreign"" characters though being German and Spanish would have seemed much more convincing had they actually spoken with a Spanish and German accent respectively, I actually had to go back and check them on IMDb because I was wondering why they were chosen for the roles and not native speakers only to discover they are.And what is with Kevin Costner's voice? I mean this is not a Batman movie.Ryan Reynolds is the only one of the main characters escaping unscathed but only because his character dies on the first 10 minutes.I'm running out of words, I'm sure I was annoyed by so much more but it's frustrating trying to remember, so I'll keep it at that. Having said all that, the movie was not totally ""not fun"" to watch; just stupid fun.",Criminal
208,z-08358,A movie that contradicts to its own title.,3,13 August 2016,"For a movie named Criminal, it shows us not much of a real criminal, but a bunch of simple-minded people. The complex plot that entangles itself is absolutely to blame for ruining a cast of great actors, including one of my favorite Gary Oldman. Yet, it gets worse with its messed up emotions. For a movie like this, there is no need for almost two hours to play it.The first twenty minutes tricks us into believing this is a movie involving a intelligent agent. But no, he died shortly after, and there we can only admire our great Ryan Reynolds from all kinds of retrospect. Is there really a need to use Ryan Reynolds to play a background story that can be briefed in two sentences briefing? ""An agent was sent to engage with a renegade of a terrorist group. The mission failed with the death of the agent, and now the subject who owns control to mass destructive weapons is lost.""Somehow, every character in this film is stupid. The composed commissioner Gordon is being reckless that he actually let an important asset go twice and then regrets his decision, twice. The devastated widow of Bill is amazing, as well. She is so touched by a guy who claims to have his deceased husband's memory that she forgot this guy broke into his house and tied her up. I guess this is the power of memory? I really don't know what to say except good for you Jerico. Getting out of jail and get yourself a free family. Oh, I almost forgot to mention that you will be the new Bill in the CIA just because you have the memory of a former agent.As for a convict who claims, once again, having the set of skills and intelligence of a CIA agent, Jerico does not really utilize much of his ""skill"". How do you not know you will immediately expose yourself when you try to pretend a guy who's already dead? How? Furthermore, I guess when you know there will be people looking after you, the last thing you want to do is punching a lot of people to expose your whereabouts.Finally, the only watchable thing might be the emotion links in Bill's family. A family reunites with its father through memory. However, I was not convinced at all. With so many memory clips, the ones with every member of the family are scarce. What we have is a bunch of useless ones involving the Dutchman and erotic scene with Jill. If you want to build emotion about family that can get the audience to sympathize, a simple scene of the parents pushing a swing will be enough. Don't show us no damn silver brush. You don't convince anyone.",Criminal

215,mullinski-92040,"Underrated, star filled thriller!",9,6 July 2021,"After re-watching this movie on Netflix I just had to get myself onto IMDB and put down a review on paper, metaphorically speaking.This movie has to be in my top five most underrated movies of all time. It has some great actors and they don't underperform either, Kevin Costner plays his character very well indeed and pulls of a great, believable performance. Gal Gadot, Ryan Reynolds, Gary Oldman, Jordi Molla, and Michael Pitt all bring there 'A' game to make what I believe is a great movie.The story line, while simple, is very effective at keeping the entertainment flowing and although this is an American movie (albeit set in the UK) it has the gritty feel of a British gangster flick in parts. Jerico is an ex-con without the capacity for remorse due to that part of his brain functioning incorrectly, yet through this he's able to host the memories of fallen CIA agent Bill Pope, in the hope that they can uncover the identity of the terrorists behind his death and not only find justice for Bill but stop them from committing further, more heinous crimes.This movie is violent, gritty, intelligent, suspenseful and heart-warming at times, but most of all it is entertaining and very enjoyable, if you're having doubts please give it a try you'll not regret it.",Criminal
216,learningbell,A bit underrated than it deserves,8,11 August 2021,"I was a bit half-hearted to see the average ratings on major sites but went on to watch it partially due to the cast and also a rather intense opening.I guess it became a blessing in disguise since I didn't have much expectation and was in just for a thrill but gosh, it's more than that!The good parts:
1. The plot is simple yet rather refreshing.2. A very good character development portrayed by Kevin Costner. All-in-all, acting is top class for most characters in most parts of the movie.3. Good actions albeit a bit violent in some scenesWhat can be improved:
1. As with many other star-studded shows, some of the actors didn't get to shine as much as we think they should. Or could it be due to a less-than-ideal character development?2. There were some buffs in the movie and there are points when the audience can easily question why certain agencies might lack the capabilities that could have made it a even more exciting movie.3. Some of the transition points might make you cringe a little, but once you get pass all that, it'll get better.So overall, the good points surpassed the parts that could have made it a better movie.

This is an action packed movie from start to finish. If you don't like action then why watch it? The movie starts a bit slow, but, you will get the gist of it as it wont let you go, just hang in for the first 5-10 minutes of this film, then after that, your eyes are glued. An enjoyable movie for the whole family to watch , with a bit of everything there to please someone. Like, you want ROMANCE, suspense, Action, Chases, Power and Compassion.....

224,trappergraves,Brilliant from start to finish! (contains possible spoilers),10,19 April 2016,"Now, I'm sure a lot of people are going to see it as an action film and nothing more. But really, it's so much deeper than that. ""Criminal"" is brilliant. Everything about it, the setup, the cinematography, the music, the story, all of it is this intricate dance that teases us with bits and pieces before it's finally laid out before us. The directing, how beautifully choreographed everything is, the quick scene shots that build the tension, are truly masterful. Gal Gadot, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones, Ryan Reynolds all perfect in their parts. Ariel Vromen has crafted an amazing work.But Kevin Costner was just amazing. If you think you know him from his movies, well, you find that you really don't know him at all. Watching the transition from somewhere between a child and an animal, thinking only of survival, to a thinking, feeling human being is really beyond words to describe. And the way he plays Jericho, like how he holds his hands as if they're in shackles, even when he's free to let you know that he's been in the system more than he's been out. You could see him as simply a brutal thug, but he is so much more. On one level, he's an animal, doing what it takes to survive. People don't really exist to him, except to take things from. He doesn't really relate to them at all. At the same time, he's a child, never being able to grow past a certain point, stuck at the time of the accident, acting out as a child would. The short time that Ryan Reynolds' character has on screen is crucial to the way the story plays out for Jericho. And, as the movie progresses, we see flashes of Bill Pope, not just the memories, but the mannerisms, the gestures, even the facial expressions and tone of voice. Kevin Costner has done this so perfectly, so subtly, that it might slip past the most casual of viewers, but it's a critical piece of the story. It's fascinating to watch the flashes of the other personality, Jericho's confusion at the whole idea of feelings, something utterly foreign to him. He has these feelings, and isn't even sure what to call them at first. His sudden familiarity with language, pass codes, computers, stand out to us because they're so very NOT Jericho. But the easy facility with all of them IS Bill Pope, and they're played as if Bill is operating inside Jericho's body, which he is. But not all the time, which makes it even more interesting to watch, the flip back and forth between this near animal and the family man/agent/very civilized human being.The anarchist, Xavier Heimdahl, and the CIA head, Quaker Wells, look very similar to each other. I don't think this is an accident. They are both driven men, not averse to violence, doing anything to achieve their ends. Xavier is trying to use one man's knowledge to destroy everything, Quaker is using one man's knowledge to stop him. Two sides of the same coin. Everyone is expendable to them. They are both zealots.I love the extra touches, the homage to ""Flowers For Algernon"" (if you read the book, you'll know), for example.Yes, it's a violent movie, but the violence is a necessary part if you're going to understand what's going on, the nature of memory, the difficult and unlikely hero's journey that our main character takes. If you want a movie that delivers far more than mere action, this is it.",Criminal

Jericho is a man who suffered a brain injury as a child that took away the use of his frontal lobe. This left him with the animal instincts of survival with basically no other human emotional traits as well as leaving that portion of his brain as virtually a blank canvas. The movie was action-packed, there were no slow points, the acting was spot on, the photography was great, the characters well defined. Jericho is a human experiment that the government forced to happen. The results are what one might expect from government interference in such a situation. If the world every goes full on crazy, I want Jericho on my team! I would go to see this movie again with a friend and I will certainly buy the DVD when it comes out.

The marketing lacked punch and perseverance so audience turnout was lackluster. I liked this movie but didn't love it.Reynolds' character Bill Pope is more than a cameo but less than a supporting role. Costner's portrayal of Jericho Stewart arcs nicely with restrained resistance and confusion of a man who's new memories conflict with his damaged frontal lobe causing emotional disconnect and real anger issues.Tommy Lee Jones supports this crime drama as Dr. Franks in a more understated role than I enjoy watching but gives the role a nice edge.
