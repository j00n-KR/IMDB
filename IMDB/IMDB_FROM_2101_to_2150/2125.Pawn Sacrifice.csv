0,Leofwine_draca,A very well made movie,7,1 September 2017,"PAWN SACRIFICE is, on the face of it, a film about the famous chess match between American and Russian rivals Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky in the 1970s. However, it's not so much about chess, and rather a psychological portrait of a mentally ill man. Fischer was a real character who was adversely affected by the pressure of the international chess scene, and this movie gets inside his head in a very clever and intense way. That's no surprise given that it was directed by the excellent Edward Zwick, who has directed such superlative fare as GLORY and THE LAST SAMURAI in the past. Tobey Maguire gives a very good performance as the nervy protagonist and Liev Schreiber is perfect as his rival; the constantly underrated Michael Stuhlbarg also excels in support. Overall this is a very well made movie, one which kept my interest throughout.",Pawn Sacrifice
1,SnoopyStyle,obsession and madness,8,27 August 2016,"Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire) is a chess master and Russian Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber) is his nemesis. His mother is a Russian immigrant who instilled a fear of spying in him. They don't get along and become estranged. As he rises in chess rankings, he is confronted by the Russian chess players playing as a team. He quits calling them cheaters. Lawyer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) recruits Bobby to continue playing as a way to fight the Cold War. Father Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard) is his constant companion and the only friend who understands since he beat both Bobby and Boris when they were young. Bobby's mind deteriorates and he gets more paranoid. His sister Joan Fischer (Lily Rabe) fears for his mental health.Tobey Maguire delivers an intriguing performance of obsession and growing madness. The chess is more compelling than expected. The big match between Fischer and Spassky turns into psychological warfare. It touches on the specific era of the Cold War. It's a maddening character study and a surprisingly effective thriller.",Pawn Sacrifice
2,Hitchcoc,Spider-Man to Bishop 3,9,1 March 2016,"This is a look at a complex man who was both a genius and mental case. Bobby Fischer dominated the news during the sixties as he faced off with Boris Spassky, the world chess champion. Toby Maguire is excellent as the cracked talent, filled with paranoia and Cold War craziness. He believed he was the greatest chess player in the world, but is his own demons constantly got in his way. Somewhere along the line, at a very early age, he became obsessed with the red threat. His own mother rubbed elbows with communists and the whole country was in fear of the Soviet Union. Fischer, when left alone, assumed he was being bugged, and went to dramatic lengths to find these bugs. He was also highly sensitive to sound. When he met Spassky for the first match of the world championship, he began to react to even the slightest sounds. Probably about as autistic as one could be, he made the people managing him go to great lengths to appease his ridiculous demands, including holding one match in a storage room. Spassky is portrayed as a bit of a paranoic himself. This is a movie about a man who is hard to like, but the portrayal is well crafted. This is the best thing Maguire has done, in my opinion.",Pawn Sacrifice
3,kosmasp,Check Mate,7,17 September 2016,"The artist previously known as Spiderman is playing games now. Well I guess that would be one (very wrong) way of describing this. While he comes off as a bit of a brat (to put it mildly) and I can't confirm how close to the truth this is based on, the overall story is pretty strong and the tension is there, even if you can figure out where this is going very early on.So if this was game of chess, you would feel like you know which pieces would be moved next and who would win in the end. Does it actually all happen like you imagine? Maybe not, but overall you can trust your feeling. Which does not take away too much from the movie, because it still works ...",Pawn Sacrifice
4,blanche-2,brilliant but disturbed,9,15 February 2016,"Well, the reviewer before me absolutely trashed this film for its dramatic license, so now I don't know what to say.This is the highly fictionalized story of Bobby Fischer, a chess fanatic and genius who rose to the very top of his field. He was part of a Russia vs. U.S. superiority struggle when he played Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber), the world champion back then, in the '70s. It's unlikely he understood that; he didn't have a broad or worldly focus. The chess was all he cared about, that and money.Biopics sometimes take a lot of liberties. Characters are made up, time is shortened, incidents are moved around, elements are put in for dramatic emphasis. That's why you can't take a biographical film as factual. It's better if you become interested in the person and read about him, as I did about Fischer, though I remember him.Toby Maguire does a fantastic job as Fischer. Yes, Fischer was tall and Maguire is short. Frankly I wasn't made aware of Maguire's height while watching the film.I believe the filmmakers were trying to give us a psychological story -- a complete genius with an IQ of 181 but one who also had mental problems. Lots of so-called geniuses are strange, I suppose, but Fischer was a real study in opposites.He often made unreasonable, last-minute demands, made anti-Semite remarks, and accused the Russians of colluding against him. In the second game of his world championship against Spassky, he didn't show up. Nevertheless, his achievements in chess were remarkable, and many consider him the greatest chess player who ever lived.His later life was a mess; he became reclusive; his passport was revoked and finally, Iceland took him in. By then he was off the wall completely.Edward Zwick directed this film with a lot of zip and made it an intense and absorbing experience, as did the actors. Look at this as the psychological story of a phenomenal talent whose emotional/mental problems interfered with his life and career. Don't take it as the detailed life of Bobby Fischer, his relationship with his mother, and who taught him what. The most interesting thing about him was his incredible talent.",Pawn Sacrifice
5,sunwarrior13,A Watchable Movie About Bobby Fisher,9,27 October 2016,"Pawn Sacrifice is a biographical film based on the true story of US Chess Grand Master(GM) Bobby Fischer particularly his experiences leading to his match with Russian GM Boris Spassky during the 1972 World Chess Championships. It stars Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky together with Lily Rabe and Peter Sarsgaard. The story starts when Bobby Fischer was a young child at age 6 who feels that he is being watched by Russian spies.Then,we get to see him develop into becoming a great player of chess after he immerses himself into the sport.This leads him to becoming the youngest Grandmaster in the world.Cold War is ongoing and Russians apparently have dominated the sport.This leads Fischer have more determination to become better in the sport and to win against the Russian grandmasters for the sake of his country.His efforts leads him to meet GM Boris Spassky in the 1972 World Chess Championship in the championship match and become fortunate enough to beat him. Well,it was nice to see this film. Tobey Maguire did well in his portrayal of Fischer.He definitely remains one of the better actors we have in Hollywood today.Too bad that it does not really dig deep into the subject particularly Fischer's life and the Russian dominance in chess.A better research on the topic could have made it a better film.In the end,it just became a watchable movie that a viewer will surely enjoy.",Pawn Sacrifice

7,CinemaSerf,"A story that gripped the world, but not the cinema...",6,18 May 2020,"This could have been a fascinating account of the troubled life of American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer - unfortunately, Tobey Maguire just couldn't quite convince me that he was that man! The well documented life of this chess genius and of his many demons is the stuff of public record, but this interpretation borders on the melodramatic just a bit too often, and the lead performance is way too one-dimensional for me to get beyond the initial reaction that he was a bit of an arse. An hugely accomplished master of his craft, but as an human being - an arse. There are flashbacks to try and give us some guidance as to the causes of his paranoia - his mother was a communist living in the USA so he genuinely believed that the FBI were listening in on him from a very early age - a neuroses that never left him - and as such his sense of trust was internally compromised and his ability to form meaningful relationships never remotely developed. Liev Schreiber - who really only features towards the very end, does indicate a bit of the grace and professionalism of arch-rival Boris Spassky but it is delivered by Edward Zwick in an almost grudging fashion - the pesky Ruskies will do just about anything to win - except, that is, play fair! It does demonstrate the effectiveness of the cold war chess battle that many of us will recall from the 1970s, but it could have been much more adventurous and less stereotyping with it's characters.",Pawn Sacrifice
8,grantss,Great insight into the talent and mind of a tortured genius,8,10 August 2019,"A dramatization of the life of Bobby Fischer, one of the greatest chess players of all time. While covering his early life and chess career, focuses largely on the 1972 World Chess Championship match between Fischer and the reigning champion Boris Spassky.Great movie. Shows well Bobby Fischer's exceptional talent for chess and also the mental issues that seemed to be part and parcel of this genius.Always interesting but not consistently engaging though. Coverage of Fischer's childhood and early career give a decent background to how his talent and personality and mental issues developed but aren't compelling viewing. However, when the movie reaches the 1972 World Championship Match it shifts into top gear and becomes incredibly engrossing viewing.Great performance by Tobey Maquire as Fischer. Solid supporting cast that includes Liev Schreiber (as Spassky), Michael Stuhlbarg and Peter Sarsgaard.For an even greater insight into the talent, mind and personal demons of Bobby Fischer watch 'Bobby Fischer Against The World' (2011). Superb documentary.",Pawn Sacrifice
9,oscaralbert,Now that even a second-string computer can beat Boris Spassky . . .,9,30 September 2015,". . . and Bobby Fischer at chess simultaneously, one might wonder if there's a reason to see a movie about people playing this obsolete game nearly 50 years ago. PAWN SACRIFICE is worth seeing since it documents how ONLY folks with serious brain defects can beat top-level Russians. Bobby Fischer is shown here using his paranoid schizophrenia to best Spassky, the pride of the U.S.S.R. Spassky's Russian ""Evil Empire"" itself was briefly crushed a few years later by an Alzheimer's-riddled Ronnie Reagan. Now another Balkan Crazy, Vladimir ""Mad Dog"" Putin, has arisen to threaten America on the World Chess Board, annexing U.S. allies left and right as the ""sane"" desk jockeys in the White House and Pentagon merely sit back and dither about it. PAWN SACRIFICE tells us it's high time that we ask ourselves, ""WWBD?"" If America remains stale and predictable, we'll lose. President ""I-Like-Ike"" Eisenhower MADE the Jewish Fischer (and no doubt thousands of other boys--non-chess-savants--in his demographic) crazy by declaring a random Jewish mom named ""Ethel"" from Bobby's mother's circle to be a Russian Master Spy, and electrocuting her THREE TIMES in the highly-publicized most gruesome state murder in American history. This ""MAD"" policy of Ike's had the U.S.S.R. shaking in its boots, not knowing what insane tactic we might undertake next, as documented in THE BOOK OF DANIEL and elsewhere.

Maguire gives a commanding performance as troubled genius, chess wizard extreme Bobby Fischer who will stop at nothing to be the world champion making it a bloodsport to thwart reigning game czar, Russian Boris Spassky (low-key Schreiber). Maguire's laser-focused, obnoxious to a fault, demanding Fischer is complex yet ultimately sympathetic as the demons of mental illness slowly fades in just as he's at his peak.

11,Uriah43,Historically Flawed,6,8 April 2017,"This film takes place during the Cold War with a young American by the name of ""Bobby Fischer"" (played by Tobey Maguire) setting out to become the World Chess Champion which had been under exclusive domination of the Soviet Union for almost 40 years. Yet, even though he was a most formidable challenger there were several obstacles he had to overcome, which not only included an incredible number of skilled Soviet grandmasters, but his own character flaws as well. To that end, this film provides an interesting--albeit somewhat flawed--glimpse into this person's unique quest. Now, having said that, let me first state that I thought both Tobey Maguire, and Liv Schreiber (as ""Boris Spassky"") performed in an excellent manner. However, to be fair there were certain aspects which lacked historical accuracy and should probably be mentioned as well. First, I don't believe this film gives an accurate or honest portrayal of Bobby Fischer. Yes, he would often become quite agitated when distracted by noise. But let's be honest, he wasn't the only chess player to voice his displeasure in that regard. Likewise, there were a couple of times he walked out during certain chess competitions. However, it should be noted that Bobby had religious restrictions which forbade him from playing on the Sabbath. So when his legitimate objections were ignored he did what he felt was necessary. Yet rather than giving him credit for putting his religious beliefs ahead of everything else this film uses this fact against him. Also worth mentioning is the fact that Bobby was very shy and socially awkward. Unfortunately, rather than taking this into account this film makes him look like a raving lunatic instead. Now, that is not to say that Bobby didn't eventually go completely insane. But this was a gradual process which accelerated after he won the World Championship due in part to his feelings of betrayal by the same religious institution he had put so much faith--and money--into. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, Bobby was quite shy and as a result he preferred to do things on his own and was very much a loner. That said, this movie greatly exaggerates the influence ""Father Bill Lombardy"" (Peter Sarsgaard) and ""Paul Marshall"" (Michael Stuhlbarg) had upon him. Further, it should also be mentioned that Boris Spassky was not the World Champion when he and Bobby sat down at the board during the Piatigorsky Cup in 1966--that honor belonged at the time to Tigran Petrosian and it would be another 3 years before Boris could claim that title. To that extent, these are just a few of the inaccuracies detailed in this film--with several other flaws out there that I haven't mentioned. That being said, those who have followed Bobby Fisher's career will probably be less than impressed with the manner in which he has been portrayed. Ironically, in spite of these criticisms, I still found this film to still be entertaining to a certain degree and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Pawn Sacrifice
12,ferguson-6,Is it Paranoia if they are after you?,7,17 September 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. Being such a fan of the expert documentary film BOBBY FISCHER AGAINST THE WORLD (2011), I found it a bit challenging to clear my head and accept a dramatized approach to the story. This was after all, one of the most fascinating reluctant public figure during one of the most energizing signature events of the Cold War between Russia and the United States  it was even described as World War III on a chess board.Director Edward Zwick (Glory, Blood Diamond) and writer Steven Knight (Locke, ""Peaky Blinders"") wisely focus the story on the infamous World Chess Championship match in 1972 between American Bobby Fischer and Russian Boris Spassky. This was 8 years prior to the ""Miracle on Ice"" when the USA Olympic hockey team upset the powerhouse Russian hockey team, but this chess match caused every bit as much media frenzy and national pride as that day in Lake Placid. This international attention is as important to the story as the psychological state of Bobby Fischer and his genius-level chess skill. And it's the media and citizenry reactions that provide the contemporary comparison to what we see too often these days thanks to social media  icons are born, chewed up, and forgotten.Tobey Maguire plays Fischer, and despite lacking the height and physical presence of the real chess champion, he expertly conveys the paranoia, fear, and arrogance that burdened the man and created even more suspense for those of us keeping a watchful eye at the time. Liev Schreiber (""Ray Donovan"") plays Boris Spassky, and even speaks his lines in Russian. Schreiber captures the iciness for which the Russians were known, but also interjects subtle personality and insight in a story where his adversary is constantly over-the-top. Chess strategy isn't so much the story here, as are these two men from different worlds forced together on a stage in Iceland – with the full attention of the world.Supporting work is varied, but exceptionally strong. Robin Weigert plays Bobby's mother, and we get glimpses of why he later suffered from Mommy issues – in no small part to her intimate gatherings of Communist friends. Lily Rabe is touching as Bobby's sister and possibly the only person who ever had his best interest at heart. However, the real intrigue comes in the form of Peter Sarsgaard as Father Bill Lombardy, and Michael Stuhlbarg as Paul Marshall. Lombardy was Fischer's coach and confidant, and seemed to be the only one who grasped the severity of Bobby's mental state. Marshall, a well known attorney in the Music industry, is a shady fellow who seems connected to the government, and is really the driving force behind getting Fischer to play Spassky. More background and the motivation for these two gentlemen would have been welcome and filled a gap.The story of the tortured genius always makes entertaining fodder – think Van Gogh, Mozart, and John Nash. Bobby Fischer certainly fits that description, but his story is frustrating because we just don't understand the mental issues that caused him to evolve from teenage chess prodigy to World Champion to literal anti-social outcast spewing hateful words (watch the end credit film clips). This film is a worthy primer for the man and the times, and a reminder that we are always searching for the next hero  the next person to hoist up on the pedestal, only to be replaced soon after with another, and then another. Perhaps the film says as much as about us as a people, as it does about Bobby Fischer as a person.",Pawn Sacrifice
13,mm-39,Intriguing,7,4 October 2015,"Pawn Sacrifice is intriguing. One watches Pawn Sacrifice wanting to know more. The characters of Fisher and Spassasky were believable. The director creates a brilliance of Fisher's unpredictability which stymies the opposition. One is mesmerized by the recurring theme of Fisher's unpredictability. Why? What is he doing? The bizarre and unpredictable actions come to fruition as opponents become unhinged. Fisher's tactics made others fight on Fisher's terms. Were the tactics mental illness or planned? I do not know. . Was the C I A bankrolling Fisher? I speculate, maybe. In the end, we see Fisher's brilliance slowly drive him mad. A exciting movie on what could be a dull and dry topic, chess. 7 out of 10. Liev Schrieber should get a academy nomination for the the role of Spassasky. Liev Schrieber clapping at the greatest chess game ever played shows a love for a game which exceeds politics and personal rivalries was a memorable moment. Worth seeing.",Pawn Sacrifice
14,siderite,"Explains Fischer, but takes some liberties",8,18 March 2016,"Tobey Maguire is great in this film. No matter what qualms one might have, you absolutely got that at least. The movie also manages to do something rather difficult: make real chess look interesting and have dramatic tension. The intensity of the story is exacerbated by the gravity of Fischer's mental condition. Having personal experience with afflicted people, I can tell you that if you don't want to see crazy people you should avoid this film.The interesting thing is that, even if I like chess and I am all for strong performances, I couldn't really enjoy the film. I don't think it is a bad movie, quite the opposite, and probably my feelings are getting in the way of correctly reviewing the film, but I felt like pausing the film or even going on fast forward at times. I wanted to know what happened, but I didn't want to go through it.Bottom line: it was difficult to me to see a brilliant man devolve mentally and hurting everyone around him and himself. That is what the movie is really about. Having it be about a real person and a genius in a sport I like is just the icing on the cake. Fantastic acting, though, from Tobey Maguire, who manages to channel Fischer, even if he looks nowhere near like the real man.",Pawn Sacrifice

The second-hour is simply terrific, and the legendary matches between Bobby Fischer & Boris Spassky, are expertly handled. The narrative doesn't catch you instantly, but once it does, it makes sure you can't move from your seat.Steven Knight's Screenplay is an ode to Bobby Fischer - A Troubled Genius. The Writing gives enough time for us to grasp to his paranoia's, as well as be awe-struck by his sheer talent for Chess. Even the supporting parts, particular that off Spassky, are well-written. However, had the Writing been a bit tighter in the initial reels, 'Pawn Sacrifice' would've been more superior.Edward Zwick is a Master in Modern Storytelling. He Directs 'Pawn Sacrifice' with conviction & command. He strikes the balance between a biopic & a legendary chess battle. Bradford Young's Cinematography is top-notch. Steven Rosenblum's Editing is mostly crisp. James Newton Howard's Score is great, as always. Art & Costume Design are perfect.Performance-Wise: Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer, is riveting, yet again. He transfixes as the Chess Legend & also emotes his paranoia's, without missing a single beat. Why wasn't he nominated this year? This underrated actor is far more versatile, than he's been perceived to be. Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky, is faultless. Peter Sarsgaard as William Lombardy, is mature & real. Michael Stuhlbarg as Paul Marshall, is emerging as one of the finest actors of his generation. He's brilliant! Lily Rabe as the Late Joan Fischer, is sincere. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Pawn Sacrifice' deserves to be seen. Watch It!",Pawn Sacrifice
16,StevePulaski,"A film stuck on fast-forward, so much so that it almost eclipses a wonderful, observant performance",6,26 September 2015,"Edward Zwick's ""Pawn Sacrifice"" concerns American grandmaster Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire), a man who sky-rocketed from a humble chess prodigy in Brooklyn to a globally recognized name. Bobby grew up modestly, but was constantly burdened by nobody other than himself. He had a very low tolerance for loud noises and persistent distractions; all he wanted to do was to play chess in peace and, in turn, be the best player in the entire world. Ironically, what he got was deafening noise and an audience of the entire world.After making the rounds as one of the youngest up-and-comers of the American chess world, Bobby voices his desire to beat all the chess greats in the Soviet Union in the 1970's. To earn the title of the world grandmaster, Bobby would have to beat the Soviet's greatest player, Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber), in the 1972 World Chess Competition. Bobby makes clear that he is not a political man; he simply wants to win and to accept all the glory that comes with being the greatest chess player of all time.The problem is that Bobby, who already seems to be teetering on the very edge of a mental breakdown every two minutes, spends more time practicing - going as far as to practice with one of his coaches by having a verbal game of chess - than trying to cope with his mental illness. At one point in the film, Bobby is said to be suffering from a form of paranoid schizophrenia, which makes sense seeing as how, during scenes of stress or extreme concentration, Bobby begins embellishing every little background noise (a flickering camera, the tapping of a pencil's eraser, lips smacking, etc) as if it were loud music at a house party. During these scenes, Zwick smothers us with these sounds as if we're Bobby, victim to hearing every noise as if it were right next to our ears. These particular scenes feel very authentic and do something cinema rarely does, which is attempt to make us feel how our protagonist does in the present.With that, Maguire gives his best performance since ""Brothers"" in a role that challenges him in a similar manner. In ""Brothers,"" Maguire played a war-torn veteran suffering from post-traumatic-stress-disorder and, upon returning home, encountered an entirely new battle with his wife. His performance in that film was incredibly strong, especially the last twenty minutes, where Maguire displayed some of the most violent and unbelievably convincing acting of his career. Here, his Bobby Fischer character is burdened with the same albatross; he suffers from something he has no control over that slowly eats at him until he is entirely unable to focus. His illness handicaps him throughout his quest to defeat the Soviet chess players, and when we see how badly Bobby wants to win, in spite of himself, there is an extra layer of sadness to his struggle.The problem with ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is it feels a bit too much like a film stuck on fast-forward. Zwick, writer Steven Knight, and editor Steven Rosenblum conduct the film with a great deal of montages, especially during the chess games, that creates an appalling lack of investment and suspense. It seems to be a sign of insecurity over the material, as if the audience that was already attracted to the material would grow bored over watching a simple chess game. The concern is logical, but when we see how Zwick handles the more crucial games we get to see Bobby play in certain detail, it's only perplexing to wonder why Zwick decided to confine most of the game to a montage. The result, when we do get to see the cause-and-effect relationship with the players and their pieces, even if we know nothing about chess, is surprisingly gripping and naturally suspenseful, something I didn't see happening.Unfortunately, too, we also don't get much development on the Soviet players, and for how great Spassky is said to be, and how assured and commendable Liev Schreiber has been as an actor over the last few years, it's almost criminal that we do not see him nor his character shine at any point in the film. Much like Bobby's other opponents, they are cold shells that walk around in dapper clothing and with an unfazed smug on their faces.""Pawn Sacrifice"" can be a great many things; sometimes an engulfing thriller about dealing with one's self, a suspenseful sports film, and a nicely edited and acted biopic, it sadly suffers from a presumable lack of confidence with its source material, in addition to a lack of development. It's a film to watch, digest, and to try not to forget on bigger terms than just its singularly strong performance what with the multitude of great film surely upon us in coming months.",Pawn Sacrifice
17,KineticSeoul,Simple and yet gets the job done,7,23 February 2016,"There has been many sports movies and such so it was actually kind of refreshing to watch a movie about a chess prodigy. Although it lacks depths and layers to it, it gets the job done in a simple fashion. Although I do think a bit more depth to the story and a bit better writing could have done this movie more justice. However as it stands, it's a good movie with a decent build up and a somewhat thrilling tournament which involves two players, a board and pieces. So this is a film based on the life of Bobby Fischer who is portrayed as a impolite, arrogant and inconsiderate narcissist but was one hell of a chess player. Now I don't know how much of this is true in real life when it comes to the Bobby Fischer's characteristics. However I do give this film respect for it trying to stay close to the source material while portraying a flawed chess player. Who isn't super likable and is someone the audience would probably not like enough to care as much but empathize with despite his chess playing gift. I just don't like to give respect to someone just because they are really good at something. I respect people that has integrity and has a heart and kindness without any harmful motives, being really good at something is a bonus. But I do give credit where credit is do and Bobby Fischer did play one of the most important and greatest chess tournament during the 70's. And he is a legend when it comes to chess and was really good at thinking ahead and reading people. However he was a guy dealing with paranoia and even a bit of a spaz. However he is unpredictable, which probably played a factor in his playing style. Well at least how he was portrayed in this film. Like I said, I respect this film for trying to give a more realistic portrayal a very important chess game. Without it going in a overly dramatic and pretentious direction. Overall, this is a pretty decent watch, it wasn't anything mind-blowing or something that is impactful in a emotional level or anything like that. But it is a good watch and I thought Tobey Maguire put on a fairly good performance in this. And Liev Schreiber nails it once again as the opposing rival.7.1/10",Pawn Sacrifice
18,Hellmant,"Zwick made a movie about chess, feel like an exciting sports flick!",8,2 October 2015,"'PAWN SACRIFICE': Four Stars (Out of Five)Biographical drama flick; examining American chess champion Bobby Fischer's fight with mental illness, as he also attempted to win the 1972 World Chess Championship. It stars Tobey Maguire, as Fischer, and it costars Liev Schrieber, Peter Sarsgaard, Michael Stuhlbarg, Lily Rabe and Robin Weigert. The film was directed by Edward Zwick (who also helmed such acclaimed drama flicks as 'GLORY', 'LEGENDS OF THE FALL', 'THE LAST SAMURAI' and 'BLOOD DIAMOND') and it was written by Steven Knight, Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson. I found the film to be extremely interesting, insightful and surprisingly intense. The story follows Bobby's (Maguire) life story; beginning when he was a child (Aiden Lovekamp), and continuing all the way up to his victory, at the 1972 World Chess Championship. The film first focuses on his relationship with his mother (Weigert), and his depression/anger over the absence of his father. The filmmakers show how Bobby first got into chess, and then became obsessed with it; through his teenage years (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick). The movie also (obviously) centers on his mental illness (as an adult), and his fight to defeat Boris Spassky (Schrieber), at the Chess Championship.Maguire gives another amazing performance in this film, and it's a shame he hasn't been working nearly as much lately. The rest of the cast is decent as well, but it's totally Maguire's movie to shine in. Zwick always delivers excellent direction, and it seems as though he had a really good script to work with too. I really enjoy how much the film focuses on mental illness, and how someone who suffered with it, so severely, was still able to accomplish great things. I also like how Zwick made a movie about chess, feel like an exciting sports flick. It's definitely a movie worth seeing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/uU2Z04j5ZzE",Pawn Sacrifice
19,cherold,"The intersection of celebrity, politics, mental illness, and chess",8,26 August 2016,"When I was a kid, Bobby Fischer was a big deal. He was a brilliant chess player known for his eccentricities. And I was perplexed as to how chess had become a big deal.Turns out it was another cold war proxy fight in which the U.S. and Russia were trying to prove their inherent superiority. This was not Bobby Fischer's idea; he just wanted to be a chess champ. In the movie, he's fairly oblivious to the tides of history, at least until he gets caught up in paranoid theories.This is a very interesting movie with a terrific performance by Tobey Maguire that manages to make chess riveting even if, like me, you have to real idea what's going on. The story it tells is clear and concise, as a mercurial Fischer descends into paranoia while those around him push him forward at any cost.In fact, the story is a little too neat. The movie feels very much like the movie you'd expect to see if you remember Bobby's weird demands and celebrity. But usually life is a little more complicated than a movie. Reading about Fischer on wikipedia, I saw things that didn't fit in with the movie's view. For example, Fischer was unusually athletic for a chess player, working out regularly during the World Championship, and his love life went beyond hooking up with a prostitute; he later married, which is hard to imagine of Maguire's version.Still, this is a fascinating, well paced movie that is constantly engaging. This is one of these movies, like All the President's Men, that has figured out how to bring intense drama to hard work and tedious thoroughness.It also makes me wish I'd actually read some of those chess books my dad bought me; I always just sort of stumbled through without ever understanding the complexities of the game.",Pawn Sacrifice
20,paul2001sw-1,Chess sacrificed,6,8 November 2021,"Bobby Fisher was a chess wizard, cold war icon, and crank. When he won the world championship, dethroning Spassky, one of a long line of Russian champions, it was a major global event, but one that took place in a mood of mutual paranoia. 'Pawn Sacrifice' tells the story of Fisher's ascent. What the recent 'The Queen's Gambit' did well was in its presentation of the chess, and conveying what it might be like to be playing the game; unfortunately, this film doesn't match it. Indeed, if it was fiction, the chess would be a McGuffin, and any competitive endeavour might do just as well. Perhaps in consequence Fisher, as played by Tobey McGuire, comes across less as tortured genius and more as a petulant brat. Fisher's story is truly amazing; but watching this, I yearned for documentary.",Pawn Sacrifice
21,ThomasDrufke,All the Wrong Moves,5,30 September 2015,"To make a great sports film, or any film rather, you have to make the audience care about the characters. Sadly, not only did I not particularly care about Pawn Sacrifice's characters, but the lead, is enormously unlikable. With that said, I acknowledge that it may have been Edward Zwick's intentions (who I am a fan of by the way). He gets great performances from his leads, the film just doesn't really mesh though.Tobey Maguire gives one of his better efforts in recent memory, playing Bobby Fischer, a beloved chess player from the 1960's. Much like the film Miracle, this sports film deals with the political issues going on with the Soviets and Americans and integrates it into the films story organically. But Pawn Sacrifice does it to a much lesser extent especially considering most of the Soviet references are through Fischer's subconscious. Fischer is similar to Gene Hackman in The Conversation where he is constantly paranoid that people are watching and listening to everything he does. This revelation is the source of Maguire's performance and the depth that his character has. But once again, there was nothing that got me to care about what Fischer was going through, in fact, I was almost pulling for the Russians, and I don't think that was Zwick's intent.Liev Schreiber plays Fischer's main competitor, Boris Spassky. Unfortunately he becomes underutilized as we only see glimpses of him before the final 35 minutes or so. That was another issue I had, is that the film takes a long time to really get going. For the first half, it seemed like most of the intriguing scenes were cut and then just explained right after. I'm not a chess guy, but we don't see him play chess for more than a few minutes until late in the film. It also didn't make much sense to me what his friends' use for coming along were other than keep him sane. We don't get a sense of their back- story or what traveling with a crazy man like Fischer gives them. So Pawn Sacrifice is really nothing special. It has a few wasted performances from Maguire and Schreiber and gives just a very average look at Bobby Fischer's life.+Performances+Last act-Slow-Unlikable lead-Should I be rooting for the Russians?5.7/10",Pawn Sacrifice
22,A_Different_Drummer,exhilarating! -- an extraordinary achievement,9,9 December 2015,"Your humble reviewer was not present at the script meetings, but you cannot help but conclude that writer Steven Knight set out to do the near-impossible -- with a minimalist presentation, no CGI or special effects, not even slo-mo, make a chess movie that packed as much punch for the viewer as Ali-Foreman, or any other sports event you might name.This wonderful film is like the bumblebee. On paper it should not fly. In real life, it soars.This film works and works atreat. Maybe not the greatest biopic ever but darn close.It helps that the topic is a man who even those of us who ""remember the era"" barely knew or understood.Maguire gives the performance of his life. If you use a stopwatch you will be astonished at how much of his performance is merely facial expressions in close up. And it works.The rest of the cast is solid as a rock. Schreiber leaves Ray Donovan so far behind you would think this is a different actor. Sarsgaard, one of the most empathetic actors in the game, is the glue that keeps the film together.Mesmerizing from beginning to end. Exceeds expectations.And here is a tip.According to media legend, after the Spassky match, Fischer did a 7 minute comedy bit on Bob Hope where he not only showed perfect timing but more importantly showed none of the eccentricities on which this script was based. Watching this clip just after seeing this film (from one of the many ""tube"" sites - Google it) is an unexpected bonus for being a child of the digital age.",Pawn Sacrifice

I really enjoyed this & recommend it,8,23 December 2015,"""Bobby won't crack, he will explode."" Ever since he was a young boy Bobby Fischer (Maguire) has been obsessed with chess. His dream of becoming the youngest world champion ever has been crushed by the Russian's way of playing and he slowly starts to lose his mind. Wanting to prove to everyone, and himself that is is the best in the world he sets up a series of matches with Boris Spassky (Schreiber), the best player in the world. As the match draws closer Fischer begins to descend further into madness and it starts to affect his ability to play. I knew very little about the real story of Bobby Fischer before watching this so most of this was new to me. For a movie about chess I have to say the movie was actually pretty exciting to watch, and Maguire really surprised me with his acting. I'm not sure how historically accurate this is but watching it the tenseness was there and you really felt uncomfortable for and with Bobby. One of the surprise movies of the year that deserves a bigger audience than it will get. I really enjoyed this and recommend it. Overall, great acting and great drama. More movies like this should be made. I give it an A-.",Pawn Sacrifice

26,Reno-Rangan,With this 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' is over for me.,7,14 September 2016,"I know Bobby Fischer a genius American chess player, in fact, after watching the 'Searching for Bobby Fischer', which is another biopic as this one. Other than that I know nothing about his life, so I'm very thankful for this film. From the director of many sensational flicks comes this to inspire you. Wait, did I say inspire, but I'm little confused over how this film to be considered. Bobby Fischer was a great player, but he had some mental issues. So you can compare him to John Nash from 'A Beautiful Mind', except they're from different fields, but very intelligents.This film was a little patriotic abut the American nation, especially defeating the Russians in the chess game. So I'm being neutral here. Bobby was the one to focus how he makes his life big with the game that requires a brain. The story began with short span of childhood and then soon skipped to adult Bobby Fischer competing in a biggest tournament in the world, a championship against the best. Nicely filmed with lots of exciting scenes, particularly Tobey Maguire as the main lead was brilliant. Liev Schreiber was another surprise with his frequent on and off role.Good film, but feels it is not complete, there should have more to it and like I said earlier, it has impacted, but not inspiring way which is why I'm doubting the screenplay. A man like him and a film about him should have nominated for several international awards, including the Golden Globe and the Oscars. Sadly, it failed at the box office, as well as to get recognised at the film festival circuits. Still, it got praised, looks not for the artistic work, but as the compensation. If you watch it, you will know there's something wrong, otherwise a film like this won't go unnoticed. I hope someone else makes another film about him in a grand way. Meanwhile, it is a good watch, but what do you expect from the Bobby Fischer like his game or personal issues will decide how much you liked it.7/10",Pawn Sacrifice

In his journey faces many difficulties not only from the Soviet Unions players but also from his owns demons.I have to say that I expected more from this movie because I am always fascinated from biography movies.Despite the good directing made by Edward Zwick, Tobey Maguire makes a poor performance as Bobby Fischer. I liked the interpretations of Liev Schreiber who plays as Boris Spassky and he is very good at it, Peter Sarsgaard who plays as Father Bill Lombardy and Michael Stuhlbarg who plays as Paul Marshall. I believe that these three interpretations saved this movie and I cannot even imagine what would have happened if they wouldn't be there.Finally I believe that ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is a medium movie, don't have high expectations and you won't be disappointed. It's just a simple movie for your spare time and nothing more.",Pawn Sacrifice
28,zkonedog,Great Acting & High Drama In A Wonderful Period Piece,9,25 February 2017,"Despite the fact that I can't play chess worth a lick (and haven't really even given it all that much of an effort), I've always found the game to be fascinating as the ultimate test of mental acuity. It has been said that just four moves into a match, there are 288 billion permutations thereafter. Wow! ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is the story of perhaps the greatest chess player of all time, Bobby Fischer, and his tumultuous battle both with the Soviet Union's best chess players and his own inner demons.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with Fischer (Tobey Maguire) not showing up to his promoted matched with Russian Grand Master Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber). It is clear that Fischer is not well. The film then flashes back to scenes from earlier in Bobby's life, where he is managed by Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) and mentored by Father Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard). Despite being a chess genius, without a doubt, there is always the chance that Bobby will dive off the deep end at any second. As his stature grows, he catches the eye of the Soviet Union (locked in the heart of the Cold War with America), who will stop at nothing to make sure their champion, Spassky, is seen as superior. This sets up the epic clash between Spassky and Fischer, where a good deal more than chess is on the line.""Pawn Sacrifice"" is a great film primarily because of the superb acting performances all around. This is the type of movie that needs simmering drama and sustained emotion to succeed (can't rely on special effects or action/adventure), and all those things are provided. Particularly noteworthy is Maguire as Fischer. It's the type of performance that, had the film succeeded a bit more financial, could have garnered him some awards. All the auxiliary cast are spot-on as well.It's also quite a feat to take a movie that primarily consists of two people staring at a board contemplating seem drama-filled. Obviously, the backstory of everything else going on is what creates the majority of the drama, but even the chess scenes themselves are fraught with tension and suspense. For those who think chess is ""boring"", they might have a different view after watching ""Pawn Sacrifice"".Probably the only thing keeping the picture from being truly great is that a bit more development could have been given to the Spassky character. The story of Fischer is intriguing, to be sure, but for every ""hero"" there must be equal shrift given to the ""villain"", and sometimes that fails to happen here. The scenes where Spassky is given some development are great and Schreiber shines, but they just seem a bit few and far between.All told, ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is a great movie for those who like historical biopics or are interested in Bobby Fischer's story or chess in general. The acting performances carry the way, and there is a sense of tension right up to and even through the final credits. You'll never believe that chess can be this exciting!",Pawn Sacrifice
29,eddie_baggins,A forgettable battle against the odds tale,4,6 March 2016,"Proving once and for all that chess is not a ""sport' to be watched for excitement, Last Samurai and Legend of the Fall director Edward Zwick try's his very best to make something out of the no doubt far more appealing real life event of chess champion Bobby Fischer taking on Russian chess wiz Boris Spassky, but Pawn Sacrifice is a fairly forgettable battle against the odds.Set during the heat of the cold war tensions between America and Russia, this battle of wills and minds enchanted countries and viewers the world over and has been documented in various formats including the fabulous and much more exciting documentary Bobby Fischer Against the World but Pawn Sacrifice fails to replicate the essence of what made this unique event such a big deal at the time and for Zwick in particular it marks a curiously down trodden entry into the filmmakers normally highly entertaining repertoire.Once known exclusively for his epic sagas that often involved battlefields and emotionally manipulative plot progressions, Zwick seems a curious choice to have taken on Fischer's story and can't find the right tone to either make us care for Fischer or his plight and Pawn Sacrifice acts as one of the directors weakest products despite a committed Toby Maguire lead turn.Taking somewhat of a backseat in recent years, Maguire gives it his all as Fischer and almost makes the strange and tortured soul someone we can root for even though his a highly unlikeable and intense individual. It's a testament to Maguire's skill as a performer that he almost pulls it off but in some sense also its hard to overlook the fact that both him and Zwick would've been feeling awards love was on the horizon with Pawn Sacrifice made in the mould of biopics the Academy normally laps up but Pawn Sacrifice was meet with a rather dull reception upon release and it's not hard to see why.For history buffs of the Cold War era and film fans that count themselves as chess fanatics, Pawn Sacrifice will be a new favourite but for the rest of us it's merely a bearable film that offers some sporadically intriguing snippets of a bygone era and another showcase for the unique skill set of Toby Maguire.2 bugged telephones out of 5",Pawn Sacrifice
30,l_rawjalaurence,Biopic of a Chess-Playing Genius Driven to the Edge of Sanity by his Obsession,7,28 June 2016,"The Bobby Fischer/ Boris Spassky chess clash of 1972 was big news at the time. It was advertised as a clash of ideologies - democracy versus communism, freedom versus totalitarianism, plurality versus conformity. When Fischer emerged triumphant, it was seen as a vindication of American values, and the then President Richard Nixon made considerable cultural capital out of it.Edward Zwick's biopic of Fischer (Tobey Maguire) takes the match as its central focus of attention, but concentrates more on the intensity of the protagonist, who from an early age proved himself a genius at chess but found it difficult to adjust to the rhythms of daily life. He rejected his mother (Robin Weigert) at an early age, and separated himself from his sister (Lily Rabe). As he establishes his reputation on the world chess stage, he acquired two full-time companions - former chess player Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard) and fixer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg). Fischer's behavior is often abominable, as he reveals a John McEnroe-esque tendency to criticize everything, from the excessive noise in the chess arena to the lack of money on the table.As he grows older, so Fischer becomes more and more obsessed with winning the world championship - so much so that he shows clear signs of paranoia. He imagines himself pursued by the Soviets at every tick and turn, and blames the Jews for having created such an untrustworthy universe (even though Fischer is himself Jewish). In several sequences he is shown destroying hotel telephones as he searches for the (non-existent) bugging devices. In the end we understand the significance of the title; it is Fischer himself who is the ""pawn sacrifice,"" as his monomaniacal devotion to chess costs him his sanity. Director Zwick encourages us to ask whether all the effort was really worth it.Cinematographer Bradford Young's camera seldom allows Fischer any breathing-space, we watch Fischer's expressions, that range from total impassivity in the chess arena to maniacal obsession as he runs down flights of stairs, trying to escape from everyone. Maguire gives a convincing performance in what is admittedly a highly difficult role.Having said that, the film does contain several slow passages that could have been effectively excised. Too much attention is spent focusing on silent sequences in the chess arena as Fischer faces up to Spassky (Liev Schreiber). There are also some historical inaccuracies: the BBC did not carry the NINE O'CLOCK NEWS in the mid- to late Sixties (it was only given that title a decade later); thus the logo that appears on screen - showing the BBC reports of Fischer's chess exploits - seems anachronistic.Nonetheless PAWN SACRIFICE is generally worth watching, if only as a demonstration of how a so-called sport can often take over an individual's life.",Pawn Sacrifice
31,paul-allaer,"Selective look at the life and times of Bobby Fischer: ""Bobby has problems.... So did Mozart""",4,26 September 2015,"""Pawn Sacrifice"" (2015 release; 115 min.) is a fictional bio-pick about chess legend Bobby Fischer. As the movie opens, we get archive TV news footage from a bunch of different countries with the shocking news that Bobby Fischer did not show up for Game 2 of the Chess World Championship, as we see Fischer holed up in his room, refusing to come out. We then go back to ""15 November '51, Brooklyn, NY"", where we meet 8 yr. old Bobby, growing up with his mom. We already see his mind getting restless quickly, but also starting to astonish with his chess moves. At this point we're maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: when I herd earlier this year that a movie was being made about the life and times of Bobby Fischer, and that it was directed by none other than Edward Zwick (the director of ""Glory"" and ""Defiance"", among others), I was pretty excited about it. Alas, it was not to be. What I thought would be a bio-pick on Fischer's life, turns out to be a very selective look instead. The movie's focus is clearly, and almost to the exclusion of everything else, on the 1972 World Championship against Boris Spassky. Yes, we do get a few glimpses of the younger Fischer. Fischer's mental problems do not get examined in-depth but are dealt with hastily. ""Bob has problems"" comments Father Lombarty, to which someone responds ""So did Mozart"", and end of story. Most disappointing for me was that the film essentially stops with Fischer's win in 1972. The remaining 36 years of his life, which remain clouded in mystery for a good part, are dismissed in about 2 minutes at the end of the movie. The leading acting performances, with Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky, are quite good, but keep your eye out as well for up-and-coming Canadian actress Évelyne Brochu in the role of Donna, Fischer's very first girlfriend (when he already was in his 20s). If you are interested in a more in-depth look at the life and times of Bobby Fischer, I'd readily recommend the excellent 2011 documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against The World"".""Pawn Sacrifice"" opened this weekend on five screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. I was eager to see it. The matinée screening where I saw this at today turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater.

33,PWNYCNY,Iconic chess player depicted as chronic complainer.,8,23 September 2015,"Bobby Fischer is depicted as being moody, pushy, nasty, obstinate, possibly mentally ill. At times he is outright detestable. The problem with the movie, therefore, is that although it seems intent on depicting Fischer as a sympathetic character, one who is being manipulated for political reasons, the exact opposite is achieved. Instead of coming off as a hapless victim, Fischer is depicted as contributing to his own victimization, thus making his character far less sympathetic. Like his handlers, Fischer himself has no use for Communists and lets his feelings be known loudly on that subject. He also has no use for his mother who to him is little more than a Bolshevik whore, hence the basis for Fischer's mouthing off about communism. Thus, he's not cut out to be a Cold Warrior. Patriotism does not figure into Fischer's actions. All he wants is to be left alone so he can prove that he is greatest chess player in the world and make a lot of money. He doesn't need or want the political notoriety which to him is nothing but a distraction. Pay him enough money and he'll play chess anywhere in the world. Of course, Fischer's wishes are ignored and soon chess when played by Bobby Fischer is transformed into a weapon, and the player into a warrior. The question is: how does Fisher handle such pressure? The answer is: not well. One wants to sympathize with him. Even the White House is urging Fisher to play. Nobody really cares about Fischer personally. He's just being used. Yet, he is depicted as being so prissy, self-centered and mean spirited that it is virtually impossible to sympathize with his him or empathize with his plight. In the movie, Fischer is as nasty as his handlers are deceptive. Nothing about him is lovable. Even as a child he is argumentative. As a young child he tells his mother's boyfriend to get out of the house and then scolds his mother for being a communist. Far from being a hapless victim or politically naive, Fischer fully understands what his handlers expect from him, which, not unreasonably, just makes him angrier and more oppositional. Soon, people are questioning Fisher's sanity. After all, how could he possibly believe that the Russians are rigging the matches and tapping his phone? (This at a time when it was standard practice for the KGB to engage in all kinds of covert espionage activities. So Fischer's concerns were not far-fetched.) Not surprisingly, he eventually chucks his career, and then becomes, not surprisingly, a fugitive from US justice over, again not surprisingly, another controversy involving Bobby Fisher and chess. For the rest of his life Fischer is forced to live the life of an expatriate even though he did nothing to warrant such harsh treatment. This effectively ended the career of a world champion chess player whose only ""crime"" was refusing to let himself become a pawn in the big chess game being played between the US and the USSR. But despite the shoddy way Fischer is treated, still in this movie we're glad to watch him go. It's a relief. After all, according to the movie, Bobby Fischer was nothing but an obnoxious ingrate and a chronic complainer, and who wants to deal with a chronic complainer?",Pawn Sacrifice
34,AudioFileZ,A Great Cold War Victory & Rembrance of A Iconic Person,7,15 February 2016,"Bobby Fischer was, by many knowledgeable chess aficionados, the greatest chess player to ever live. As of 2015 there is a sizable number of twenty-somethings (maybe those in their 30's) who have no clue who he was, maybe even never playing the game of chess either. One might see this as an opportunity to correct a slight injustice or a sign that no one cares? Tobey McGuire goes for a bit of later day historical correction in Pawn Sacrifice as he and writer Steven Knight bring Fischer back to life for your introspection and entertainment.Chess as entertainment? In spite of all it's drollness, yes. This is in no small part due to the enigmatic Fischer and his all-time great defeat of Boris Spasky in the Cold War super-match of 1972. It sealed Fischer as chess icon and political pawn in a time when the US was trying to assert any dominance over communism it could achieve without actual war. Within this the game of chess was elevated to a heady pinnacle from which it quickly fell and has never quite recovered. Perhaps if this was all it would be more of piece for a documentary, but with Bobby Fischer being the most integral ingredient it deserves more and that is what viewers get here.Without ever bogging down in too much minutiae the story of how a very young boy with laser like vision believed he was to be the world's youngest Grandmaster Chess Champion is quite entertaining. Fischer from the time he was self-aware believed his lot in life was to be the world's greatest chess player. Complicating it all was the fact that he was somewhat anti-social outside of chess and had a mother who the CIA pegged as a potential communist political threat. High strangeness ensued in Fischer's youth that would only ramp up with age and his own disillusionment. In spite of it all he became a icon in the Cold War between the USSR and USA. A reluctant American hero if you will even though he crashed and burned as he fettered away his chance at becoming the youngest ever World Grandmaster Champion.McGuire brings it in his recreation of Fischer. The viewer actually feels turmoil just watching McGuire bring to life the war between his own greatness and crippling paranoia. It's not a totally sympathetic characterization in that as a viewer you often feel contempt for Fischer's selfishness. I'd say there's great truth in McGuire's realization of the man who for a moment united American pride much like the celebrated moon landing of 1969. It's also nice to see a fine role, and performance, by Peter Saarsgaard. And with limited screen time Liev Schieber turns in an excellent portrayal of the great Soviet Chessmaster Boris Spasky. Add an excellent score by James Newton Howard which includes fantastic period music and what could be a boring as paint drying is anything but. This is a great movie which also sheds light on the injustice of Fischer being somewhat forgotten as of the new millennial. A highly recommended film that should spur some latter day interest in a time where we counted winning against Russia in any way possible, even at the game of chess, as a great victory for our nation.",Pawn Sacrifice
35,TheOneThatYouWanted,Changed the story to save money making the movie,4,6 March 2016,"When I first heard about the movie I was excited. I always knew about Bobby Fischer but wanted to know more about what made me go crazy and etc. Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor and did a great job with the script and direction he was given but because the script was so small, so to speak, and the director was many a little too timid or something when it came to the subject matter, all of Tobey Maguire's hard work in this movie is for nothing. Basically the film is about chess prodigy Bobby Fischer preparing to play the biggest game of his professional career. And that is about it.. and that is also the problem. The movie is so small that it feel claustrophobic. It was like 90% of the movie was shot in random hotel rooms. It was as if they didn't have a dime to spend on more background actors, better locations and etc. They even had to change the actual story in order to save money. Bobby Fischer's mother never left him, she spent years trying to help him. But this movie makes it out like Bobby was crazy from the start and the pressure of playing chess on a grand scale only made him more crazy. Liev Schreiber is an excellent actor but is completely wasted in this movie. His role of chess legend Boris Spassky could have been play by anyone because of how generic the role was written. The script is the major issue but they did it to keep production cost down. Unfortunately they also turned the movie into a boring little nothing of a film. It was like the first hour and 20 minutes are just filler until the Fischer vs Spassky match. This could have been Tobey Maguire's comeback film but now it is just another average post Spider-man movie for Maguire. What a shame.",Pawn Sacrifice

37,bandw,Chess champion biopic should appeal to a general audience,8,16 February 2016,"This is a fictionalized biography of the famous chess champion Bobby Fischer. Early scenes from Fischer's childhood are given, but the focus is on the proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union waged on the chessboard between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky in Reykjavik in 1972. With any fictionalized biography I always wonder what is truth and what is fiction, but from doing some research on the web (mainly Wikipedia) it seems that this movie presents things pretty accurately, especially given the tendency for most movies based on fact to change things for dramatic effect. Chess does not lend itself to mass appeal, but this movie does a good job of pacing things to maintain the interest of a general audience.A knowledge of chess is not required to appreciate this movie. All that is necessary to know is that chess in an inordinately complicated game that requires intense concentration. Games at the championship level can last five hours or longer. Not a game for those with a limited attention span. The movie maintains interest, with little emphasis on the details of chess. Liev Schreiber makes a great Spassky and and Toby Maguire is fine as Fischer, but I think it was problematic to cast McGuire as Fischer. McGuire's small stature and general personality is at odds with Fischer's being physically robust and intellectually intimidating. There seems to be an attempt to cast this as a typical sports movie as underdog bucks the odds to defeat the master, but Fischer was a top ranked Grand Master and it was not at all unexpected that he would put up a fight. That being said there *was* a ""solitary U.S. contestant takes on the Soviet chess machine"" aspect to the match.I am old enough to remember the Fischer/Spassky match and the political circus surrounding it. It will probably be hard for a younger generation to fully appreciate the significance of the cold war as the backdrop contributing to the tensions of this match, but the movie does a good job of building the tension for the match. For a brief moment in history chess was *the* sport. Hard to fathom from some forty years on. I did learn some things from this movie, such as Spassky's standing and applauding Fischer for his masterful play in winning game six of the championship. And I never knew that Henry Kissinger had called Fischer to encourage him to go to the match.This movie wants to trace Fischer's paranoia to two things: his childhood, growing up with communist parents in the cold war era, and the stress of chess competition. However, after having seen the straight up documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against the World,"" I think the representation of Fischer's mental instability in ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is overemphasized. In BFAW Fischer is seen as much more disciplined and focused than is hinted at here. For example he maintained a physical fitness regime to equal that of most professional athletes. As serious as Fischer's mental illness apparently became I have to believe that it was more organically based rather than environmentally based. Based on some of his outrageous anti-Semitic and anti-American comments in his later years there is little doubt that his grasp on reality had been seriously compromised, but he had the wherewithal to stage a rematch with Spassky in 1992, which he won.What accounts for the continued interest in Fischer? For example, Gary Kasparov is close to being Fischer's equal at chess, and his life as a writer and political activist after retiring from chess has been remarkable, in a positive sense. But Kasparov has not obtained anywhere near the status in popular culture as Fischer. Why is that? Is it interest in Fischer's fall from grace? Do tragic lives interest us more than successful ones? Is it due to Fischer's mad genius persona? I guess oddballs are more interesting than grinds. As a counterpoint to ""Pawn Sacrifice"" I recommend the excellent and captivating movie, ""Searching for Bobby Fischer."" That movie, also based on a true story, shows that a more well-rounded person can excel at chess at a high level.Another movie that details how sports and politics were bound together during the cold war is ""Red Army."" Hockey in that case.",Pawn Sacrifice
38,DeeNine-2,Worth seeing but a bit disappointing,6,30 April 2016,"This is a nice vehicle for Tobey Maguire who does a good job of portraying a paranoid schizophrenic, but that person is not Robert James Fischer. They got Maguire's hair style right but otherwise any resemblance between the tall, lanky, expansive Bobby Fischer and Maguire is slight. He probably didn't see enough footage of Fischer at that age. He didn't use any of Fischer's mannerisms that I noticed and of course Fischer was several inches taller. Liev Schreiber who played Spassky actually looks a bit like Spassky but is bigger and more robust. So we have in the movie Fischer vs. Spassky at the chess board but Spassky bigger than Fischer! As for games mentioned in some detail I had to go back to the first and sixth games of the match to recall what happened and to compare my perception with that of the commentary in the movie. The sixth game was a brilliant game as almost everybody agrees, but contrary to some popular opinion Fischer did not blunder away his bishop in game one. He and Spassky were in a clearly drawn bishop and pawn ending. He wanted more, but there was nothing he could do, so what he did was sacrifice his bishop for two pawns, not as some people think in an attempt to win the game but to show his confidence and to shake Spassky up a bit. Fischer thought the resulting position after many moves would be a draw. He was wrong but this is an example of Fischer psychology: I will make you play a hundred moves if necessary just to show you how strong I am. You will weaken not me.Some reviewers pointed out some chessic type errors but there weren't that many and they were minor. Here's one they got right that may surprise some people. Notice that Fischer used the descriptive notation (""P-K4"") while most other grandmasters even back in 1972 used algebraic notation (""e4""). And while there were chess clock on analyst boards where they serve no purpose at least the boards were set up right with the white square at the player's right hand, avoiding a common error in movies.Probably the biggest error had nothing to do with chess but with the fact that Fischer's mental illness at the time of the Spassky match had not developed as much as the movie suggests. His personality was more rounded than displayed. He actually had a charming side. People liked him in spite his bad manners and selfishness. There's a YouTube video of him on TV with Bob Hope filmed sometime shortly after the match with Spassky that shows a very different Fischer than the one Maguire portrayed.The bit with the girl (sarcastically she says to Fischer: ""it was good for me too"" as he studies a chess game in bed) was apparently director Edward Zwick's take on the nagging question of Fischer's sexuality, meaning yes he was heterosexual, but chess was just more interesting.The real disappointment for me was that they did not make clear the really great triumphant of Fischer's preceding the championship match. He destroyed three of the top grandmasters en route to the title match, at one point winning 20 games in a row. Amazing. The greatest streak in grandmaster history. So he was a clear favorite although Spassky was the World Champion. That's why he wanted so much to win the first game and confirm immediately that he was clearly superior.I was also disappointed that Fischer's life after winning the championship was not explored. I had hoped for a cinematic take on what happened to ""The Wandering King"" (the title of a book about his life by Hans Bohm and Kees Jongkind). Perhaps that material would be better presented in a documentary than in a popular flick.Bottom line: worth seeing but not as good as I had hoped.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""The World Is Not as We Think It Is""",Pawn Sacrifice
39,leftbanker-1,Almost Nothing to Do with the Game of Chess,5,24 December 2016,"In 1993 Bobby Fischer was arrested for playing handball with his own poop. When the police interrupted he was ahead 7-3. He would have won! Idiot-savant Bobby Fischer was really good at a board game. Americans—rightly so—mostly believed that chess was nothing more than a game, like bridge or Monopoly® and chose to pay more attention to other silly games like baseball and football. Bobby Fischer came along and for a brief moment in American history a lot of people feigned interest in chess. Fischer won some tournaments and then quickly went off the deep end and you have the feeling that he was a lunatic who probably walked around with a steaming load of crap in his pants as he played chess games in his head against an imaginary opponent.Instead of the film's long music video sequences which attempt to capture Fischer's Asperger's Syndrome or whatever the hell was wrong with him it would have been infinitely more interesting to see a little more than a stereotypical view of his Russian opponent.Speaking of the music, it was totally dreadful for most of the film and I found it confusing and distracting. I realize that they were trying to add a historical perspective with the music but it came across to me as amateurish and irritating and not even slightly relevant to the matter at hand which is chess. Fischer's personal mental state was absolutely the least interesting aspect of this story yet that's the main focus of the film. The historical significance of the events and how chess became—at least briefly—an important phenomenon in America and how Fischer became a household name seems to me to be a more important and a much more interesting subject for a film.The least interesting thing about this guy was his mental illness. Chess, on the other hand, can be intriguing to most people with even a rudimentary knowledge of the game but it takes a skilled storyteller to pull this off. I would direct you to Martin Cruz Smith's novel Stalin's Ghost. The author's description of a speed chess tournament (called a blitz) is absolutely the finest writing about the game that I have ever come across. Movies try to make chess exciting by having players hurl pieces around the board and slam the clock after moves but this short episode in a book that has little to do with the game is positively thrilling. It is truly a masterpiece of writing. And maybe they could have talked a lot more about the game of chess which was barely broached in the film.P.S. I know that I said this before but the music in this was just about the worse use of music I've ever seen in a film.",Pawn Sacrifice
40,blumdeluxe,A bit incoherent,7,30 April 2017,"""Pawn sacrifice"" centers around the life and game of one of the greatest chess players of all time, Bobby Fischer, and his battle with both the cold war and his fragile mind. It thereby mainly focuses on the events of the World Championship in Reykjavyk.In my opinion, the biggest strength of the movie becomes also its biggest problem. The attempt to create a balance between cold war, Fischer's mind and chess sometimes fails a bit. While much screen time is used to portray the events of Iceland, his breakdown afterwards and the questionable views he expressed are only mentioned very briefly. Somehow the movie still tells this story as an American hero tale, the Soviets are still the bad guys and all in all you can't help but say that this is a quite patriotic movie. I think that taking his whole life into account would have helped to understand better what happened to this man. It is indeed sad to see a brilliant mind fall to very dumb ideas and turn into somebody you need to oppose.As it is, the movie is very much one in a row of movies showing us how pressure in sports or art can break people. Despite all my criticism it is still a good movie, thoroughly produced and the person of Fischer surely delivers enough aspects to turn this into an interesting film. One that is solid, but also one that could be even better.",Pawn Sacrifice

42,classicalsteve,The Madman Versus the Marxist: The Incomprehensibility of Genius Through Outstanding Performances by Maguire and Schreiber,9,16 April 2016,"There are a small number of bona fide geniuses who walked the Earth but also skated along the cutting-edge of madness. The late 18th-century composer Wolfgang Mozart was such a figure, often playing and behaving like a pre-adolescent as an adult. Another was the 16th-century astronomer Tycho Brahe who proved the cosmos changed and shifted, contrary to the Aristotelian model. Brahe often engaged in uncouth behavior at the dinner table, including, among other things, allowing his ""pet"" dwarf to eat scraps under the table. And Robert ""Bobby"" Fischer, possibly the greatest chess mind who ever lived, was another. We'll get to the nature of his ""madness"" and how it compromised his career later.In possibly his best role since ""Seabiscuit"", Toby Maguire in an Academy-Award caliber performance walks in the shoes of Bobby Fischer. Fischer became the youngest ever United States Chess Champion, winning the honors at 14 years old. He would continue his streak into the 1960's at the height of the Cold War. After exhausting all the accolades at home, Fischer has greater Everests to conquer. He then meets entertainment/celebrity lawyer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) who offers to run Fisher's competition touring. His second is Father Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard) who will tour with Fischer's entourage, providing emotional support from someone who knows well the game. The two will help him with logistical challenges, such as tournaments, transportation, interviews with the press, and all the while trying desperately to keep him sane.Having exhausted beating all the American and some European masters, Fischer covets beating the Russian-Soviets by challenging their champion and his nemesis: Boris Spassky (played with subtle coolness and swagger by Liev Schreiber in an equally compelling performance) regarded as the best chess player in the world at that time. While Fischer desires to prove he's the best chess player in the world, Spassky has greater ""fish"" to fry (pun intended). The point is a Russian victory over the Americans and the rest of the world would somehow prove superior Russian intelligence, and they'll use subtle tactics, such as playing to achieve more draws rather than necessarily wins.In his first international tournament against the Russians, Fischer becomes aware of the tactics. He claims the Russians are purposefully pursuing draws, essentially playing not to lose but not necessarily to win, although the phrase is never used. Spassky wins the tournament, but Fischer feels he and the rest of the chess community have been duped. Fischer was runner-up in the tournament, but refuses to claim second prize, which becomes only the tip of the iceberg in terms of strange and unpredictable behavior.For Paul Marshall and Father Lombardy, Fischer becomes insufferable. He makes unrealistic demands not only of his entourage but of the tournaments and the chess world at large. He wants more money and more amenities, such as fancy hotels and limos. He disappears from tournaments, sometimes nearly missing crucial matches. He fills his head with conspiracy-theory propaganda he hears in taped lectures and becomes convinced that both Russians and Jews are not only spying on him but planning his death by blowing up his airplane. He goes to hotels and checks to see if there are bugging devices in the phones.The chess world then agrees to produce a World Chess Championship match between Spassky and Fischer in Iceland in 1972, labeled a Cold War confrontation between East and West. It's World War III on a chess board between perhaps the two greatest chess minds in the world. The winner will be given the title World Chess Champion. When Fischer needs to board a plane flight, he runs from the terminal, claiming he had requested no photographers which were at the airport treating him like a rock star. Will Fischer travel to Iceland and meet his nemesis for a true match-up to determine who is the greatest chess player in the world, or will Fischer's eccentricities and paranoia destroy his chances? Will Spassky win by default, a result even the Russian doesn't desire?A wonderful film, the best on chess since ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" (1993). Fischer may have had the greatest chess mind in the history of the game, but his strange psychosis ultimately destroyed his career. Believing that governmental forces were out there to get him, Fischer became a recluse, behavior not unlike Howard Hughes. The tragedy of Fischer, similar to that of Mozart was, that for all his genius in chess, the same mind couldn't find a way to deal with his own demons. Governments didn't bug his phones or plan for his assassination. He played Spassky again 1992 in Belgrade, which was regarded by the US government as a violation of sanctions against commercial activities in Yugoslavia. This time he did become a fugitive of the US government, and was granted asylum in Ireland. However, not even Ireland could give him sanctuary from his own inner demons.",Pawn Sacrifice
43,drjgardner,Very Disappointing,6,26 September 2015,"The story of Bobby Fischer is a fascinating one, with personal as well as global implications, and it occurred at one of the most interesting times in recent history. How then could you go wrong?Start with a superficial biography of Fischer, especially his early years. Try to give us no clues as to how his obsessive disorder developed, or how his paranoia slowly took over his persona. By doing that you leave us adrift, simply observers watching a ""crazy"" man do all kinds of self-defeating things.Then ignore the game of chess. Treat it like it was any other competition. Don't delve into the intricacies of the game - its demands - the strategies that people develop - their characteristic approaches to the game. Just give us close ups of chess pieces and people thinking. That will surely dull us to sleep.Now ignore the other central character in the drama so there is no one to root for. Not the crazy man nor the strong silent one.This is a tragic waste of talent and a sad attempt to tell a truly fascinating story.",Pawn Sacrifice
44,RforFilm,"As a historical recreation about a Chess match, Pawn Sacrifice plays it's game well",7,1 October 2015,"Pawn to C4. Rook to H5. Knight to E6. This might seem like an odd set of references, but they are chess moves. Chess is a game that I have little experience in actual playing, but have seem everyone else in. My two best friends are adequate enough to play a good round and show how their better then me at something. I also see plenty of people, children and adults playing out in a park or inside a bookstore. What their saying to the world is, "" I'm a respectable intelligent person that knows enough about chess that I can be seen as aggressive"".I might take up chess later on in life when I feel like I need another hobby. It's not that I have no interest, but my current interests take a lot of time already. So you could imagine my surprise when my dad told me that the 1972 World Chess Championship was a big deal. Both names Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky were spoken like they were sports stars or even political figures. In a way, it's true as each represented the USA and the Soviet Union. Pawn Sacrifice plays it's game and tries to expose Bobby Fischer for who he really was.As a boy growing up in Brooklyn, Bobby Fischer is a total introvert, choosing to ignore his mother's Russian heritage and communist ways, completely immersing himself in a world of chess. He'll play against himself if he has to, but he's always seen trying to make his game better. Eventually his mother takes him to a local chess club that already knows that Fischer will become a great player. He becomes the youngest grandmaster and wins countless U.S. Chess Championships, while the rest of the world has to put up with his arrogant attitude and his never ending hunger for the world championship. The problem is that the Soviet Union has the best players and one such player, Boris Spassky (played by Liev Schreiber) has been the face of the world champion for many years. Fischer (played by Tobey Maguire) wants nothing more then to prove that he's better then the entire Soviet Union. The problem is that the late sixties were an era that started to show that Fischer was suffering from paranoia and delusions, often believing that the Soviets were spying on him. He even gives crazy demands that might have prevented him from playing in the 1972 match. The Soviets agree and the famous match is on.Strictly as a movie goer, I though that Pawn Sacrifice was a pretty good historical story about a famous match. The best moment of the movie are the chess matches, which are few, but still manage to remain exciting thanks to the film's cleverness to keep the look tight, but tense. It also does well to explain the game for non players, but I'm sure that should be little issue. What the movie doesn't do well at is to try and tell us who Bobby Fischer was.Don't get me wrong. Tobey Maguire plays him very well. It's more on the scripts blame. Sure we know that Fischer was a great chess player, had a lot of psychological problems and said some strange things, but it's all stuff that's been told. Something like Lincoln showed more about the personality of the president and Saving Mr. Banks dwelled into the stern personality of P.L. Travers. The pacing can also come off as a little slow ironically as the filmmakers probably didn't want too many chess games. I think they could have used some more. I'll give this seven chess knight pieces out of ten. Pawn Sacrifice is more likable as a historical recreation rather then an engaging narrative, but I'm glad I saw it. It reminded me that plenty of people play chess and that Tobey Maguire is an underrated actor. Consider playing this movie if you want to know more about a famous chess match.",Pawn Sacrifice
45,cultfilmfan,Pawn Sacrifice,9,26 September 2015,"Before going to see the new film, Pawn Sacrifice based on the true story of Bobby Fischer and his ultimate chess match between the then Russian champion, Boris Spassky, I encountered quite a bit of opposition from different people regarding the film and basing opinions on it before they had even given the film a chance and watched it. A lot of people seemed to be disenchanted by the fact that Tobey Maguire, was playing Bobby Fischer. I think a lot if not most of these criticisms were based on the fact that people did not seem to think that Maguire, neither looked, or had the same type of presence that Fischer had. Also being known as extremely temperamental (which later turned out to be a long battle with mental illness), would Maguire be able to pull off more of a complex role such as this? I think in a lot of people's minds it was kind of like the casting choice of when they got Ashton Kutcher to portray Steve Jobs in the 2013 movie about his life. I think it is safe to say that when Danny Boyle's version with Michael Fassbender opens next month that there will really be no comparison between the two performances and one will likely lead to Oscar gold whereas the original performance was nominated for a Razzie for Worst Actor for Kutcher. I will have to defend Maguire here and say that his performance throughout the film was pretty spot on. How truly it reflected the mannerisms, or real life episodes of Bobby Fischer, I do not know, but for a two hour film he captures your interest and gives what I thought was a decent and thought provoking performance. It won't win any awards, but for what it was it was good enough. Whether another actor would have portrayed and done the role more justice is something I do not know, and unless they make another biopic about Fischer, we will just have to wait and see. Another criticism was that the film should be a biography of Fischer and capture his whole life story as opposed to just covering the part of his life in the late 60's and early 70's with his chess match with Boris Spassky. While a full film covering all of those details would be absolutely fascinating, it would no doubt probably take too long to do and be a long film to watch, so I give credit to the filmmakers here who do touch also upon Fischer's early life and do a pretty good job of condensing everything into a two hour film. I would love to see a three hour biopic, or miniseries about Fischer, but who knows if that will ever happen. As the film stands though it is quite good. The film looks like it was done on more of a miniscule budget and I find that this aspect helps the film by not being overly flashy, or like a big budget Hollywood film. It feels more like a small indie film that is more concerned with storytelling and performances, which is what I generally tend to prefer anyways. The film is fascinating in several different aspects. Bobby's personality for one as one who is certainly dealing with paranoia and various forms of mental illness is riveting and fascinating to watch. You can see him further unravel as time goes by and how he makes these chess games his life and that it may also be the undoing of him. The fact that a lot of the people around Bobby including the American people and government seemed to me at least to be exploiting Bobby because of how good he was at chess and yet he certainly was a disturbed person, so should this have all been allowed to go on? And the fact that all the various world events at the time (the Vietnam War, the Cold War, the Watergate Scandal) all seemed to be put on the backburner over a game of chess between the Americans and the Russians. You can't help but feel that this was almost a clever diversion using a talented yet tormented man to bring forth this diversion whether he was mentally, or physically up to it, or not. Watching people play chess would probably turn a lot of people off because of sheer boredom, but here it is fast and slick and every bit as exciting as watching any other championship game of sports. The filmmakers have successfully managed to make chess and the playing of it interesting as well as showing all the world events at that time being wrapped up in these games and by also delaying, or ignoring the current political situations at the time. As well as Bobby's unraveling into mental illness and those trying to exploit him to better the name of America, the film does certainly leave a lot to think about. The writing is captivating here and the direction is low key but suit's the film perfectly. Maguire does a better than average job playing Fischer and the always good Michael Stuhlbarg and Peter Sarsgaard are great supporting players. The film is a look back at time at important events and makes you think even more about them, whether critically, or positively and makes a captivating time of it all. Definitively recommended viewing.",Pawn Sacrifice
46,Anurag-Shetty,I didn't know chess could be so intense & thrilling!,8,20 September 2015,"Pawn Sacrifice is a true story about American chess legend, Bobby Fischer(Tobey Maguire). Ever since he was a boy, Bobby Fischer has been great at playing chess. In fact, he's obsessed with chess. Even when Bobby is not playing chess, he still plays chess in his head. By the time he grows up, Bobby has won several chess tournaments throughout America. During the Cold War, Bobby Fischer faces his toughest opponent yet, Russian chess player Boris Spassky(Liev Schreiber). The two of them compete for the title of World Chess Champion. However, Bobby starts crumbling under the pressure. As the competition gets more intense, Bobby Fischer must fight his inner demons if he truly wants to win the title. Pawn Sacrifice is an outstanding film. The film is very tense & full of dramatic moments. The chess matches between Bobby Fischer & Boris Spassky are extremely exciting & will keep you on the edge of your seat. The film doesn't move at a lightning fast pace but, still kept me hooked right till the end. However, don't watch this movie if you're not a big fan of indie dramas. This film truly becomes unforgettable, due to the performance of Tobey Maguire. Maguire has come a long way since his Spider-Man days. Tobey Maguire is flawless & gives an electrifying performance as Bobby Fischer. Maguire brilliantly portrays Bobby's aggression & paranoia. It's Spidey, like you've never seen him before! Peter Sarsgaard is great as Father Bill Lombardy. Liev Schreiber is superb as Boris Spassky. Michael Stuhlbarg is awesome as Paul Marshall. Lily Rabe & Robin Weigert are spectacular as Joan Fischer & Regina Fischer respectively. Evelyn Brochu is impressive as Donna.

47,Danusha_Goska,Brilliant Performances: Troubling Account of Bobby Fischer,8,21 October 2016,"For much of its runtime, watching ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is a grueling experience. Young Bobby Fischer is growing up fearing being spied on by government agents. His mother, Regina, (Robin Weigart) is a communist living in Cold War era Brooklyn. Bobby escapes from what looks like a loveless childhood and a chaotic home life by focusing on chess.Regina takes Bobby to Carmine Nigro (Conrad Pia) a teacher who greets Bobby by telling him that chess is a religion that takes anyone regardless of nation or creed. One hopes that this kindly man will serve as a ray of light in Bobby's life, but Bobby behaves as if he is autistic. He makes little eye contact and focuses only on the board, shutting out his opponent and his mother and sister who must stand and watch as he spends hours on his first chess match with a near master. Once young Bobby loses to Nigro, he refuses to shake hands, cries silently, and icily demands another game.The real Bobby Fischer was noticeably tall and slim with very striking facial features: piercing eyes, prominent nose, large, curved lips and a sprinkling of facial moles. Tobey Maguire is short and slight, with refined features, darker hair and no moles. Fischer was from Brooklyn and he lacked a formal education. He dropped out of high school. He talked like an uneducated Brooklynite who happens to be a headline-making genius; he had a lot of attitude. Maguire is from California and he never really captures Fischer's unique voice or inflection.The film picks up with the arrival of three characters played by brilliant actors: Michael Stahlbarg as Paul Marshall, a sort of fixer / hand-holder, Peter Sarsgaard as Father William Lombardy, a chess master, and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky. These three actors are superb, and each has a moment on screen that absolutely took my breath away.Marshall is a long suffering lawyer who prods Fischer to go to Iceland to take on Boris Spassky and become the new world champion. Lombardy is the closest thing Fischer has to a friend. He serves as Fischer's second.Bobby tears apart hotel rooms seeking hidden microphones; perhaps the Russians, the CIA, or the conspiratorial Jews are spying on him. Bobby runs from journalists' cameras and the fans who want to grab and kiss him. Bobby cracks when he hears spectators cough or when he can smell their breath. He demands more money, special chairs, different rooms, quieter cameras. Though Jewish, he listens to tapes that convince him that Jews are evil people taking over the world.All this is really hard to watch. It's especially hard to watch for anyone who remembers the Fischer-Spassky match. Bobby Fischer was an incredibly gifted man. He was world famous. After his match, he could have made millions and enjoyed a cushioned retirement. Instead he trusted the wrong people, became a raving lunatic Jewish anti- Semite and a member of a cult he would later denounce, denounced America, cheered 9-11, spat on documents, broke laws, became an exile, and, after refusing necessary medical treatment, died entirely too young and unnecessarily. His ironic, poignant last words, they say, were, ""Nothing is as healing as human touch.""You can't watch this movie and not wish that somebody had done something to help this man. You can't not wonder, what was wrong with him? Was it the bad relationship with his mother? His lack of a father? His illegitimacy? Was he schizophrenic or autistic? Or is that he was treated like a star and did not receive, from others, the kind of feedback that forms character? A combination of all of these factors? Because Bobby Fischer is a commodity, even in death, we will never know.In the film, Paul Marshall, the more practical and earthbound of Bobby's advisors, suggests taking him to a psychiatrist. Father Lombardy responds that chess is a rabbit hole. He mentions the hundreds of millions of moves that chess masters must take into consideration. He says that taking Bobby to a psychiatrist would be like pouring concrete down a holy well. The implication is that Bobby's chess genius is inextricably tied to his mental illness.Lombardy cites Paul Morphy, a chess genius who could not succeed at conventional life. But look at Boris Spassky. He is still alive and no one suggests that he is mentally ill. Maybe a mentally healthy Bobby would have been an even better chess player.Liev Schreiber, in the commentary, says that chess masters must constantly predict their opponent's attacks, and that doing so contributes to paranoia. Perhaps so.Although I found the film hard to watch, the performances by the leads were so profoundly rewarding that they lifted me up in awe and made me cry. I don't know how Liev Schreiber did it, but he perfectly channeled a Soviet man from the 70s. I know because I was there in the 70s. Michael Stahlberg utterly inhabits his part, a chain smoking, sweaty palmed, tireless enabler who takes every abuse from Bobby and never stops trying to push him forward. Peter Sarsgaard is just simply superb, in every scene, from praying the rosary on his knees to the moment when dawn breaks on his face as Bobby starts winning. Tobey Maguire has a moment that is so powerful it gave me chills. He is beating Spassky. He is in his element. It is his bliss. See the movie for that moment, one I watched over and over again.",Pawn Sacrifice
48,bryank-04844,'Pawn Sacrifice' is definitely worth your time.,7,16 September 2015,"We've seen many stories, films, and television specials about Bobby Fischer, who has a reputation for being the greatest Chess player to ever walk the Earth. It's also well documented on how Fischer fell into madness and became a recluse from his paranoia until his death in 2008. Fischer was for sure a strange and chaotic man, but he was also a genius and fairly charismatic when he wanted to be. Needless to say, Bobby Fischer's life is as interesting as it is sad and is worth telling, which is why so many people have told it over the years.But with director Edward Zwick's ('Glory', 'Legends of the Fall', 'Blood Diamond', 'The Last Samurai') excellent ability to tell a story and Steven Knight's ('Locke', 'Eastern Promises') fantastic, yet brutal script, we finally get to the bottom of Bobby Fischer's descent into madness as he's challenging the Russians to a game of chess for the world championship in 'Pawn Sacrifice'. This is somewhat of a biographical film, and although it does show a young Bobby Fischer for a short amount of time on screen, the film's main focus is over the span of a couple of years where we start to see Bobby (Tobey Maguire) show signs of his mental illness and challenge Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber) to the world championship of Chess.At first, we see Bobby as a very charming young man who loves to talk to the press when he wants to, exuding an almost Muhammed Ali vibe about talking about his talent and opponents. On the other hand, he can be as vicious and cruel to anyone around him if he doesn't get his way, which at times is very unreasonable. This is where Tobey Maguire shines. I've always enjoyed watching Maguire on screen and he's come a long way since his days as Spider-Man. Maguire lets it all hang out here as he struggles with his illness and rocky life in the limelight, which at the time, he was one of the most famous people in the world. Not only that, but he was the poster boy for the United States of America, beating the Russians during the end of the Cold War.After quitting and losing to the Russians and claiming they cheated, Fischer chose to retire from chess, however a lawyer/manager/""friend"" in Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlberg) talked Fischer into beating the Russians in a series of games for the World Championship on a lengthy list of demands. To accompany Fischer on his journey to maintain his sanity was long time friend and ""only person to have beaten him at chess"" was William Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard), a priest who enjoys drinking and smoking, and of course playing chess. The banter with these guys is quite fun, but at times very sincere as they want the best for their friend Bobby, but as we learned, the greatest chess player of all time would do what he wanted, when he wanted, and became paranoid that the government, Russians, and Jews were out to get him, even though he was Jewish himself.I did like that Zwick gave us some little hints that probably some of the greatest minds in chess all had some sort of insanity in showing that Boris Spassky showed signs to of paranoia, and that it wasn't just Fischer. With an excellent screenplay and a fantastic performance by Tobey Maguire, which might give him some attention come award season, 'Pawn Sacrifice' is definitely worth your time.Recommended!",Pawn Sacrifice
49,RonellSowes,The neurotic genius,5,24 December 2020,"Chess has never been a very popular sport or activity in the United States except during the time of Bobby Fischer. Fischer brought a whole new light and popularity to game;in large part because he was the only American in a Soviet dominated field during the Cold War. Pawn Sacrifice covers this aspect of Fischer extensively as well as the other most notable feature of his life...his mental illness. By the time of his death he was practically insane but even as a young man and chess champion he dealt with psychosis. It's not enough to cast in actor who resembles him physically but also one who can convincingly pull off these characteristics. And that's where I believe Tobey Maguire was properly cast in the part. Though he is five inches shorter and doesn't look or even sound like the actual World Champion,Maguire is able to capture his personality and essence. Thus being a believable Bobby Fischer. The film also includes some strong performances from Liev Schreiber and Peter Sarsgaard as well.Pawn Sacrifice is a picture centered around the intense showdown between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer:the global attention that surrounded it and Fischer's neuroticism.",Pawn Sacrifice

My Rating 8/10
If you enjoyed the recent series "" The Queens Gambit ""the story that follows the life of Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy), an orphaned chess prodigy on her rise to the top of the World chess competition I'm sure you'll find ""Pawn Sacrifice ""worth watching .The difference between these two chess movies is The Queens Gambit is fictional but "" Pawn Sacrifice "" is based on a true and very complex character Bobby Fischer.This unfortunately was the last major film role of the incredibly talented Tobey Maguire and I think his portrayal of , Bobby Fischer the American chess grandmaster and the eleventh World Chess Champion is superb and proves again that Tobey Maguire's absence from movie screens is a loss to movie goers.If the depiction of Bobby Fischer in this movie is correct and I suspect it is from what I've read today I'm sure he would be diagnosed definitely on the autism spectrum or a paranoid schizophrenic narcissist.The film begins with Bobby as a child with a Polish Jewish mother who is being investigated by the CIA for Communist connections. Bobby like Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor -Joy's character is obsessed by chess and soon shows that he is a game master and worthy of any competitor or any competition.During the Cold War chess grandmaster Bobbie Fischer takes on Boris Spassky, the Soviet world champion. Though Fischer wants a normal match against his rival the United states wants it to be seen as the Cold War played out on the chess board. All of this isn't helping the fact that Fischer is constantly dealing with paranoia. This is the world of chess like you've never seen it before.Other fine performances in ""Pawn Sacrifice "" are Peter Sarsgaard as Bobby's friend /advisor Father Bill Lombardy , Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky and Michael Stuhlbarg as Bobby's ""Manager Agent"".Well directed by Edward Zwick and screenplay and story by Steven Knight this is a movie that surprised and delighted this movie goer.",Pawn Sacrifice

It is a way of learning something of what happened in this piece of history.I do not usually like either of the two main actors and at least Tobey does not play an impressive role, if he can be convincing.The movie tries to be a good movie, the problem is that it does not get to be it. When you're watching it, you see it's left in every department to be a great movie, none of them are on a level to be great.Photography is not a great photograph. It is a correct photograph, but not astonishing. If it gets you into the age but not more.It's pretty well set up. You think it's the time but at the same time, something fails, there is something that tells you that it is not total. It has a direction that to be Edward Zwick falls short. He is a great director, but this is not his best project. I do not usually like his planning, but he usually gets you completely focused on his films. In this one it does not obtain at all. It has good rhythm and tempo although some moments of archive take me out of the film.I think it will be a movie that will not go beyond its year",Pawn Sacrifice

54,gsygsy,Terrific Tobey,7,10 December 2015,"A magnificent, barnstorming performance from Tobey Maguire is the mainstay of this interesting movie about chess champion Bobby Fischer. Maguire's technique runs the gamut, from tiny eye movements to full-scale harangues, from the subtlest of gestures to the wildest.He builds Bobby on a bedrock of self-confidence while also managing to suggest that same confidence is a massive defence against vulnerability. The film makes a parallel between Fischer's paranoia and that of America in the Cold War, but what could merely have been an idea is made vivid by Maguire's stupendous acting.He is very well supported by Michael Stulhbarg, Peter Sarsgaard and Liev Schreiber. Women don't get much of a look-in, unfortunately, but of the three who emerge from the male fog Robin Weigert makes a strong impression as Fischer's beleaguered mother.Edward Zwick keeps the pace going admirably, aided by Steven Rosenblum's deft editing. I'm less sure about the overall look of the film, and uneasy about its shift to a finale of patriotic triumphalism that it had managed so hard to avoid - even to the extent of satire - up to that point.Unmissable for Maguire.",Pawn Sacrifice
55,bob_meg,Take my pawn. Take my king. Just end it.... Please!,3,14 December 2015,"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a Tobey hater. He's no Olivier but when there's something to bring, he brings it. That something, unfortunately, is nowhere to be found in Ed Zwick's leadenly-directed ""Pawn Sacrifice"" and Stephen Knight's pointless, uninsightful, and often downright boring script.My main problem with the film is that Knight establishes virtually no empathy for Bobby Fischer, even in the early scenes. His dad ran out on the family, Mom is a doting but loving mess, and Bobby, though very intelligent obviously has some mental issues, bordering on psychotic paranoia. Why this is, however, is never explored and neither the script nor Maguire's performance lets us into his head even for a second.I expected Pawn Sacrifice to show us something we didn't already know about the famous Game 6 with Boris Spasky, perhaps how all the political sturm and drang unhinged the already volatile personalities at center stage. It doesn't. It's really just a series of Maguire's increasingly deranged demands and violent freak-outs that become more and more tedious to endure.Edward Zwick, who usually directs light, comedic, *very* commercial fare is a horrible choice for a director, but it's par for the clueless course of Universal's dumb-em-down blockbuster mill lately (It's almost where I have to restrain myself from fleeing the theater when I see or hear the logo and cue anymore). You can see the script doctoring right in the credits (3 writers on story alone? Really?) and on the screen. In an incredibly crass and dumb script-o-tronic device, Bobby loses his virginity to a hooker (natch) who then turns into one of his most knowledgeable and ardent fans. See everyone? Bobby's appeal crosses ALL gender, race, and social boundaries! Yippee! What a bunch of worn-out pap.There is also no suspense built in the matches themselves as we very rarely, if ever, get a close look at the board. Presumably though, we are too stupid to understand the game of chess, so why bother? Why bother indeed. Maybe a Stand and Deliver checkers tournament is in the works right now. Edward James Almos, where are you when we need you?",Pawn Sacrifice
56,scottshak_111,"An exceptional biopic, well directed!",8,29 September 2015,"Edward Zwick is probably one of the most underrated directors. Critics mostly shrug his work with a meh. But to me he makes a home run with every release. His direction is of the finest kinds, extremely riveting, never lets you lose focus. He always comes with a story that has a galloping continuity, which is always heading towards something, which he always moulds into a beauty. You can hardly make out individual frames, as is the case generally with movies by other mediocre directors, as he gorgeously blends into every other shot like a pro.The story of the chess prodigy, Bobby Fischer delves into the head of a man who is dealing with paranoia. We are also introduced to his chess obsession, his genius brain, his Spassky rivalry, with the then existent cold war backdrop. It is a brilliantly shot biopic that focuses on several aspects of the game, of what it could do to people, and primarily tells us what it did to an already broken Bobby Fischer.SPOILERS AHEAD: The prologue commences at an instant where Bobby is missing from a tournament match, and the news channels all across the world are broadcasting their takes. It is a moment of national humiliation, of him going cold feet, whilst Bobby is shown being locked up in his room, wary of every slight movement, noise, and static he hears, and is wondering if there is a conspiracy going on against him. It is a great way to start a movie, and at once puts the question in the vanguard, ""Why?"" As the frames reel on, we are introduced to a young quieter Bobby, with an exceptional concentration, with unmatched interest in chess, his first defeat, the tears that followed, the persisting endeavour of 'again' and the imminent burning will of success.Tobey Mcguire gives wings to the character through his fluent acting. He breathes life into Bobby Fischer, and crawls his way into his psychosis. His ways are articulate and he speaks his heart out. He doesn't care much about the people, but that's how he was. Complementing Tobey marvelously are Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg who are exceptional as Father Bill Lombardy and Paul Marshall.The only thing that I found wrong with the movie was that his genial games weren't highlighted much. This was probably done to make the uninterested interested. To those who are avid chess players it seems unfair. We wished to know how brilliant his moves were. How unpredictable he was in his style. How he nabbed every championship he ever set his eyes on. This goes unheard in the biopic and the tale goes unmoored into his disorder territory.Despite all that the movie still uplifts Bobby Fischer and celebrates him as one of the greatest and prodigious chess players that ever lived. His game is really inspiring and watching his flair would give you the sudden urge to storm off to a board at once.",Pawn Sacrifice
57,jtncsmistad,"""Pawn Sacrifice"": Maguire & Zwick make Chess Exciting...Really!",8,24 March 2016,"Tobey Maguire is superb as the late chess phenom Bobby Fischer. It's a damn tall order to make a movie about chess compelling, but Maguire and Director Edward Zwick (TV's ""thirtysomething"", ""The Last Samurai"") manage to pull it off with panache to burn.This is an absolutely scintillating yet ultimately sad tale of a genius who could not dig out from under an avalanche of family resentment, crippling self castigation, massive ego and unchecked mental illness following his 1972 landmark victory over Soviet arch-rival Boris Spassky. Those who know one whole helluva lot more about the ""King's Game"" than I maintain that this wunderkind from Brooklyn is the best the world has ever known.Or may ever.",Pawn Sacrifice
58,Ramascreen,Intense!,9,14 September 2015,"A well-crafted biopic about one of the greatest matches in history. A career-defining performance by Tobey Maguire. Who knew that a movie about a game of chess could be so suspenseful and riveting. You won't be able to take your eyes off of it.Director Ed Zwick is the man who gave us ""Glory,"" ""The Last Samurai,"" ""Defiance,"" basically movies that have epic battlefield sequences, so it's interesting that his battlefield has been scaled down to the size of a chessboard but it's just as colossal, this is a story back in the era when the whole world was watching which of the two ideologies, United States or the Soviets would ultimately win, tension was running high but instead of bullets or nuclear weapons which both regions did have, it all came down to between Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire) and Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber) and even if the movie may or may not want to preach about which is the ultimate victor, it did capture the animosity in the air, so sharp it can cut through glass, the hatred against communism at the time.Written by Steven Knight, who gave us ""Eastern Promises,"" and ""Locke,"" I think Knight gives in to Hollywood's long-held fascination with brilliance and madness, it's a lot like ""A Beautiful Mind,"" where a person is so brilliant that his mind just snaps. Now, I didn't grow up knowing a lot about Bobby Fischer, my dad taught me how to play chess when I was a kid, but I was terrible at it, which is why I turned to soccer. My point is, I don't know how out of touch Fischer really was, and this movie itself is not a straight adaptation, but I think PAWN SACRIFICE accomplishes what it set out to do from the start, this correlation between genius and paranoia or insanity.Mad props to actors Tobey Maguire and Liev Schreiber who, under the direction of Ed Zwick, successfully manage to dramatize the game of chess. Because chess matches are usually silent, so everything heavily relies on the actors' facial expressions, it's all in the eyes and the body language in order to understand the game's intensity. The movie has to also entertain those who may not play chess and so it does, and it's a testament to the amazing performances by Maguire and Schreiber.The movie also brings up a good point that I think would leave the audiences conflicted. Because we would feel like Bobby Fischer would need medical treatment, but a part of us also don't want to hinder or get in the way of brilliance, out of selfish reasons of course, because we would want that brilliance to work in our favor. We badly want to see the master play but at what cost.",Pawn Sacrifice
59,PeterRoeder,Very good movie,8,19 September 2015,"1. Young Bobby. Pretty good description of chess. He likes chess as a shield towards a dangerous world. Unlikely that he would play 1.d4,c4 etc. It is Fischer!!! Moreover, he puts the king down. Something he would never have done. Why put the king down? 2. Teen Bobby. Pretty cool too. Some weird stuff. He moves h4 and h5 on a chessboard looking into an Informator. Why? 3. Adult Bobby. Excellent acting by Tobey Maguire. Spasskij and Lombardy are awesome as well. 4. Why is Larsen cut out both of the documentary and this movie? No mention of the 6- 0 defeat of Larsen. WHY??? 5. When Fischer takes on h2 it is not actually a big mistake. Computer says small white advantage and his NEXT move h5 is a mistake according to stockfish. There are options of going to the queen side with the king. Fischer was winning stuff like that all the time but Spasskij played it well. Taking on h2 is risky though. It is portrayed like a big Patzer mistake and falsely that he resigned after g3. 6. Nh5 in the benoni game is sort of normal 7. The sixth game of the match is a beautiful game but not that great. Weak play by Spasskij. 8. Fischer never said anything wrong before AFTER he became world champion. They are mixing that up 9. The incident with the hooker is funny but wouldn't Bobby have been scared of stds? 10. He says check when giving a check. Wtf is up with that? 11. Did he actually have a close relationship with his sister Joan? 12. Did he actually have any contact with his mother even in the mid-60s? 13. The role of Donald Byrne is a bit weak but perhaps mainly because the 3 other guys are so awesome. 14. Relation with Lombardy wildly exaggerated 15. Other than that most of the chess was very accurate. The positions on the board are correct and so on. 16. They use old notation which was changed in 1981 so it is not that easy to follow their blindfold games (although it was translated into the new notation). 17. Anyway, awesome movie. 18. The incident with the chair. Spasskij wouldn't have done that in front of the board and everything although that did in fact happen (the thing with the two dead flies). 19. The conversation with the hooker about opening preparation seems a bit more like a candidate master than a strong grandmaster.",Pawn Sacrifice
60,whatch-17931,"Good movie, only sort of about chess",9,11 March 2021,"It's really about a very intelligent man under intense pressures and probably with an undiagnosed mental condition. The fact that Bobby Fischer and his mother were in fact spied on by the FBI didn't help. Also, Nixon and Kissinger really were following the 1972 match, and it really was like a skirmish in the Cold War, and Kissinger did indeed call Bobby.Though, I think the notion that Bobby (or Spassky) were like sacrificed pawns by their governments is rather exaggerated.Bobby certainly seemed to be out there, but a lot of his actions in the 1972 matchup seem to be tactics of a smart man. The ""blunder"" in the first game certainly suggests this.For the movie itself, Tobey does a fine job playing Bobby. It seems the only real complaint about him was that Bobby was really tall, and that may have impacted his opponents psychologically. That may well be true, and Tobey is a lot shorter, but it's impossible to get every nuance right, and it would probably be hard to really convey that.Sarsgaard as Father Lombardy is great, often subtly hilarious. I don't know how well he portrayed the actual Lombardy, but he tended to steal the scenes he was in.",Pawn Sacrifice

No; Long and slow movie, with a lot of shaky cam.I did not choose to play this movie, but watched anyway. I only know two things about Bobby Fischer, his name and that he was a Chess champion. What I can say about the movie it is SO! VERY! SLOW! it drags on and on! It is just shy of two hours but felt at least twice as long.Very poorly written and directed movie full of scenes that jump from one thing to another not showing anything of some chess matches and right back to more ranting, raving and paranoid delusions from Bobby! Even if every paranoid delusion and outburst in the movie from Bobby is true it is portrayed very poorly and have no empathy or connection with Bobby. The movie starts with a time jump ahead, don't miss that part.Like other reviews said, I thought Boris, Father Bill and Paul were well acted. But Tobey Maguire as Bobby seemed more like a petulant spoiled kid having tantrums throughout the movie. After awhile I got numb to Bobby's hissy fits and couldn't wait for the movie to end. They should have chosen a better suited actor to play Bobby or not made the movie.CONTENT ADVISORY: One occurrence of the f-word, Bobby meets a hooker that happens to be staying at the same hotel as him and tells her that he wants to lose his virginity, later they are shown in bed together Bobby without a shirt on sitting up in bed mostly covered by a blanket that starts at the middle of his chest and talking about chess moves. The hooker lays next to him on her stomach touching Bobby's arm with her bare back to the camera.Bobby hints at wanting her to leave so she says, ""Well it was great for me too. Thank you."" Bobby replies, ""Thank you"" as he looks the opposite direction from the hooker. Hooker sits up on the edge of the bed with her back to the camera and everything below the lower back is blocked by the blanket on the bed. No other nudity is shown. A lot of cigarette smoking and occasional hard alcohol drinking, even the priest is shown drinking the hard alcohol and in one scene smokes a cigarette.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}",Pawn Sacrifice
62,jonathanruano,Pawn Sacrifice -- A Review,7,31 May 2016,"The best movies are those where the filmmakers do their research. Director Cronenberg and Christopher Hampton clearly care enough about the psychiatric practice in order to study it carefully and skillfully weave theory into the lives of the characters in the movie, ""A Dangerous Mind."" Darren Aronofsky, likewise, clearly did his research into the inner world of professional wrestling in order to make his film, ""The Wrestler."" As a result, ""The Wrestler"" not only had compelling human stories, but we also got to understand what the lives of some wrestlers were really like with their drug use, the male camaraderie, and the physical stamina involved in one bruising fight after the other.Yet with ""Pawn Sacrifice,"" we get the sense that that Director Edward Zwick, the three screenwriters, and the producers are not really interested in learning anything about chess – despite the fact that this movie was about the only American to become World Chess Champion, Bobby Fischer. Instead, ""Pawn Sacrifice"" is solely a character study on Bobby Fischer (played quite well by Tobey Maguire) with his personality quirks and bad temper, but divorced from his chess. For instance, there are a few scenes where Bobby Fischer defeated Soviet grandmaster Ivanov. Ivanov then withdraws from the tournament by claiming that he came down with influenza. Fair enough, but how was Fischer able to defeat Ivanov? And what made Fischer's chess victory any different from the victories which other grandmasters had over Ivanov? The film does not answer these questions, because it does not even bother to take the time to explain the chess game to us. I also have the same complaint about Fischer's victory over Victor Korchnoi. Korchnoi was a master at defence and counterattack and one of the strongest grandmasters in the world by the late 1960s. So how was Fischer able to beat him? Again, this question goes unanswered, probably because the filmmakers and producers assumed that the game of chess was too boring to be worth explaining to anyone or they were not particularly interested in Fischer's unique genius for chess, which inspired a future generation of Soviet chess players like Garry Kasparov. Yet if they really felt like this, why make a movie about Fischer at all? The reason why neglecting to explain Fischer's chess games is such a big flaw is two-fold. To begin with, Fischer's brand of chess is what made him so unique and extraordinary -- not his moods or his wild conspiracy theories. Yet judging from the film, I do not yet see how Fischer's chess was any different from Soviet grandmaster Ivanov's. Second, Fischer sacrificed everything, including his sanity, to achieve a mastery over his unique craft which no one else had. So shouldn't we get a clear idea of how challenging professional chess is? Should we not be given a clear idea of the hurdles Fischer had to overcome in order to become world champion? And also why achieving this level of mastery over chess was so important that Fischer was willing to sacrifice as much as he did? These are also questions that this film has not addressed.""Pawn Sacrifice"" does have its strengths. All the performances are pretty solid, especially Tobey Maguire's as Bobby Fischer. We get to understand this man's inner demons, his intense sensitivity to noises and lights, his paranoia and anti-Semitism, and his eccentricities. These aspects of Fischer are of some interest to us, since they foreshadow his eventual and tragic psychological breakdown. Yet ""Pawn Sacrifice"" can hardly be considered a great film, largely because the filmmakers seem as clueless about Fischer's chess genius (which I assume is a hugely important component of the film) as the young woman who took away his virginity in California.6.5/10",Pawn Sacrifice
63,CineCritic2517,"Somewhat entertaining, but riddled with clichés",1,19 October 2015,"Maquire plays Fischer, the chess prodigy from Brooklyn in a run of the mil drama about a man's attempt to become world champion in his craft.The structure of the film is one we have already seen a thousand times, from the Rocky movies to more contemporary films like the Great Debaters. In those films, the hero is an underdog whereas in this one, Fischer clearly is not, although one could consider him as such given his mental instability.With little surprises as the film progresses, the audience is treated to the idiosyncrasy and paranoia of Fischer which seemed in the end to be neither here nor there. Yet, with decent acting from just about every one involved, the movie still manages to entertain as it builds up to the famous 1972 confrontation between Fischer and Spassky as the latter defends his world championship title.6/10",Pawn Sacrifice
64,CleveMan66,"See ""Pawn Sacrifice"". You'll gain so much more than you... give up.",9,27 September 2015,"Good actors know how to act ""in the moment"", while GREAT actors know how to RE-act in the moment – AND to act and react with their eyes, their faces and their entire bodies. Based on those standards, ""Pawn Sacrifice"" (PG-13, 1:54) is VERY well-acted – enough to even make watching chess games exciting.Golden Globe nominees Tobey Maguire (""The Great Gatsby"", ""Brothers"", ""Seabiscuit"" and the 2002-2007 ""Spider-Man"" Movies) and Liev Schreiber (""Lee Daniels' The Butler"", ""Salt"", the ""Scream"" movies and TV's ""Ray Donovan"") play American Bobby Fisher and Russian Boris Spassky, two chess champions whose names will forever be linked in history for their decades-long rivalry, their epic matches and, in particular, the 1972 World Chess Championship in the politically neutral location of Reykjavík, Iceland.It's difficult for those who don't remember the Cold War to understand all the commotion that surrounded these two men at this particular time and place, but the film does a very good job at communicating its importance. The movie opens with a brief scene in which we hear a reporter announce one of the strangest of many strange developments during those two months in Iceland, then gives us an interesting back story that puts it into context. The movie focuses mostly on Fischer. It quickly and smoothly takes us through a few key moments in his life as he becomes the world's youngest international chess grandmaster (as a 15-year-old) and shows us his rise through the ranks of the world's greatest players, culminating in his much-anticipated showdown with the USSR's Spassky.Fischer benefits from the help and support of various people, in spite of his erratic behavior. Carmine Nigro (Conrad Pla) mentors young Bobby Fischer (Aiden Lovekamp) from when he's still an unknown Brooklyn chess prodigy. The teenage Fischer (Seamus Davy-Fitzpatrick) becomes estranged from his mother (Robin Weigert), but his sister (Lily Rabe) supports him throughout his ups and downs. As the international star of Fischer the young man rises, but he shows no interest in the political implications of his ability to challenge the Soviet Union's chess dominance, Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) shows up. He's a mysterious lawyer who offers financial and logistical support that will help Fischer achieve his goals – and serve his nation as an instrument of propaganda. (It's kind of like John du Pont's support of the Schultz brothers' wrestling careers in ""Foxcatcher"", but with less insanity and no murders.) Marshall, along with former chess champion and Catholic priest, William Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard), spend many years helping and encouraging Fischer, as well as dealing with the chess genius' arrogant, rude and demanding behavior as well as his increasingly paranoid and fragile mental state. The film leaves out some major events and issues, and encapsulates others, but it flows well and maintains a clear focus.The story of American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer is a remarkable one and has appeared in various forms on TV and in the movies, but never this compellingly. The film's script was written by Oscar nominee Stephen Knight, who has written little-seen, but critically acclaimed movies like ""Eastern Promises"" and ""The Hundred-Foot Journey"" as well as several TV shows and 2015 feature films ""Seventh Son"" and ""Burnt"", not to mention ""World War Z 2"". The director is Oscar-winner Edward Zwick, who has directed great movies like ""Blood Diamond"", ""The Last Samurai"", ""The Siege"", ""Courage Under Fire"", ""Legends of the Fall"" and ""Glory"". The former has turned dull-sounding Europe-based stories into praise-worthy films and the latter seems to do his best work on true stories and stories in historical and/or politically-significant settings. Both of these men's talents seem tailor-made for a movie like this one, and both make great use of their individual talents and experiences which, when joined with this film's truly outstanding performances, make for a fascinating historic, politically-charged biographical drama.Maguire and Schreiber make you feel their characters' brilliance, their arrogance and, most importantly, their humanity, as they were each under tremendous pressure to perform in front of the entire world – and represent their rival nations under a microscope as focused on each of them as on any Olympic athlete. Their bodies, their faces and, especially, their eyes draw our attention to those chess boards more than most of us probably thought possible for a movie. They make us alternately feel, or at least understand, their individual moments of stress, frustration, confusion, desperation, dejection and elation. You don't have to understand chess, have personal memories of the Cold War or even speak their languages to understand what they and those around them are going through. Now, THAT'S acting.When talking about great actors, I've heard people say things like, ""I'd pay to see him read the phone book"", or ""he'd be interesting just watching grass grow"" (or something like that). Well, if there's ever a movie in which Tobey Maguire and Liev Schreiber recite a list of names and phone numbers while fertilizing someone's lawn, give me a call – especially if that movie takes place during a period of high international anxiety and has an extraordinary story as exceptionally well told as ""Pawn Sacrifice"".

66,iantrader,Well worth watching,6,23 April 2018,"An excellent screenplay by Steven Knight makes chess just about as thrilling as it can get - and you don't need to know anything about chess to enjoy it. Couple with the Cold War backdrop and it works on two levels. It is also a look at Fischer's rather sad decline and it would have been nice to see more of the post-game developments rather than the pre-game story.Some of the direction and/or editing slows the pace a little too much in places and cutting the running time by 15 minutes would have tightened it up considerably, perhaps garnering nother * but it would be churlish to criticise it too much.The actors are all superb with a special mention of Michael Stuhlbarg but that's to single out one gem in a bag of diamonds.

67,lucasversantvoort,The Cold War on a chessboard,7,14 December 2015,"First Bridge of Spies, now Pawn Sacrifice? Apparently, the East vs West theme is back in full force again. Pawn Sacrifice details the rise and fall of Bobby Fischer, chess player extraordinaire.The film chronicles Fischer's childhood all the way to his tragic end, though his later years (aka his life after winning the World Championships in '72) are thankfully left as a credits message. The focus lies on his match(es) with Russian master chess player Boris Spassky. After some early childhood scenes, we see Fischer participating in a tournament in which he ends up quitting, claiming the Russians were cheating so he'd lose on points. Not only does he quit the tournament, he quits chess altogether. Sometime later, he meets a lawyer, Paul Marshall, who considers himself a patriot. Being a patriot, he would very much like to see Fischer pick up chess once again and beat the Russians. Fischer also encounters a priest who once beat Spassky when they were young. Together they start the long climb to that fateful showdown with Spassky which would take place in Iceland. And along the way, Fischer would sink further and further into neurotic and paranoid delusions, from anti-Semitic remarks to believing the Russians might transmit rays to his brain through his dental fillings.If anything, I thought the casting of Tobey Maguire was pretty inspired. Although I'm still on the fence in terms of his acting chops, he does come across as a bit of an outsider, the odd one out, which befits the film's portrayal of the paranoid, neurotic Fischer. I also can't fail to mention Liev Schreiber who portrays Spassky. Although the film's focus lies primarily with Fischer, Schreiber does manage to inject a subtle gravitas into the character. Bonus points for the fact he had to learn Russian for the part.Director Zwick also manages to inject a film where people are pretty much standing in rooms talking with excitement and tension. In fact, the film gets better as it goes on. The chess matches in particular need a smart director who's able to turn two guys sitting at a table into a monumental battle of wills. You really get a sense of how high the stakes are, what losing (and winning) would mean for these two.The film's not without its flaws however. It falls headfirst into the trap of feeling the need to show Fischer's childhood, since this is, you know, a biopic. While attempting to seek the source of Fischer's anti-Semitism and anti-communism in his childhood is understandable, these scenes feel rushed': let's quickly establish the political proclivities of his mother, his talent for chess, his need for peace and quiet, then quickly show a fight between him and his mom to show how they drifted apart, etc. All this information could've been inserted into the present fairly easily. What's worse, it doesn't have the emotional impact it should. The acting of teenage Fischer doesn't help either...There's also the matter of the implication of the title. The film makes the case that Fischer's mental problems were ignored so that he could represent America in its 'fight' against the Russians. While the film's convincing insofar as it concerns lawyer Paul Marshall's role in Fischer's life, the film's not as successful in implicating others. With Marshall it makes sense, because he had intimate knowledge of Fischer's mental health, but other people, up to the President? To suggest they all willfully sacrificed this pawn seems a bit of stretch. The metaphor works in a general sense, however, that Fischer was in the wrong place (America) at the wrong time (the Cold War), a time when wars were fought in unconventional locations, like chess boards. In this sense, his participation has a tragic inevitability to it.I guess that's the tragedy of the film. Despite all the factual correctness, it still has to suggest so much. All these unanswered questions. I guess I can't really blame the filmmakers for not providing some clear answers regarding Fischer when psychologists are still debating these issues. The film's directed and acted well enough though to warrant your interest.",Pawn Sacrifice

69,RMurray847,6 stars for a great true story told in a pedestrian manner. Still worth checking out.,6,8 January 2021,"PAWN SACRIFICE was an interesting movie that told a good story. I was never bored. But I was also never gripped. The story of Bobby Fischer, and in particular, his rise to world champion chess player via an epic competition with Russian Boris Spassky, is amazing. I was too young at the time to have any real memories of it now, but I can only image, at the height of the Cold War, how this battle must have resonated with Americans (and Soviets).But I found the approach to tell us the story was clunky and frustrating. First of all, depicting chess on screen isn't the easiest task (at least trying to make it exciting is)...so the approach the film often uses is to have the characters played by Michael Stuhlberg (Fischer's ""agent"") and Peter Sarsgard (a priest who used to be a chess champion, and is now Fischer's ""sparring partner"") explain to each other, and thus the viewer, what is happening and why it's amazing. We never feel the amazement ourselves...we have to see THEM being amazed and by extenstion try to feel amazed. So, the chess itself is tricky. And then, so is the character of Bobby Fischer. If this were a fiction story, I'd say Fischer's character is unbelievable and immensely unlikable. I guess because it's a true story, I BELIEVE the character, but I dislike him all the more. He a massive egoist with no redeeming qualities. He plays great chess, but he treats EVERYONE around him with disdain or worse. He makes insane demands because he can. He's is also a paranoid, driven by demons that have made him crazy (to be blunt). Frankly, at almost no time do we see the ""human"" in Fischer, the guy we can relate to. He's a terribly unsympathetic character...yet I think we're meant to feel sorry for how the strains for his genius have driven him mad. I just want someone to beat the guy up! Tobey Maquire seems to do a fair job with the role (actually, everyone is perfectly fine), but the script doesn't give him a chance to earn our caring or sympathy. It dwells so heavily on his peculiarities.Also, here's a nitpick. I watched the blu-ray of this film and the detail is so fine, I could readily see the makeup on the actors, Maquire in particular. He looked like a guy smeared with inexpensive base makeup preparatory to going out on stage. Or maybe a guy with a bad spray-on tan. It was distracting!The film is quite low budget. Old newsreel footage does a lot of the plot movement for us, rather than other, less clumsy but more expensive solutions. Technically the film is unimaginative.I know my gripes sound like the film is a failure, but it is still worth watching. The performances are solid, if not quite award caliber. And the amazing story is pretty compelling. The raw material is so good, even this somewhat flat-footed telling can't take away from the sheer ""you've got to be kidding me"" of it. Worth a look.",Pawn Sacrifice
70,chas437,"Sanitized History, Plain and Simple",1,28 January 2018,"I suppose this is a nice story and the cast is top notch, but the film bares little resemblance to actual people and events. But what is unforgivable, the film gets Bobby Fischer completely wrong, and in doing so, attempts to sanitize the man's legacy.Tobey McGuire is a talented actor, but this was a terrible casting choice. His mannerisms, speaking style and physical appearance are way, way off. The real Fischer was a tall, dark, brooding, anti-social figure. His ugliness on the inside manifested itself in his outward appearance. Tobey McGuire is simply too likeable to play such a role. He tries really hard, but its just not believable.I'm old enough to remember the World Championship match in Iceland in 1972. It captivated the world and made chess popular in the mainstream. Fischer's victory gave America a much needed morale boost during the depths of the Cold War.So, while it was a triumphant moment for America, it was the beginning of a long, painful descent into madness and infamy for Bobby Fischer. The film portrays Fischer as a somewhat lovable eccentric with a paranoid personality. In reality, Fischer was almost certainly somewhere high on the Autistic spectrum. He had other serious mental disorders as well. None of this was clinically diagnosed, but was evident in his actions over the years. He was a loner who treated people very badly. He died
penniless, friendless, as an international criminal. His was not a life to be celebrated.A much better film on the subject is the 2011 documentary ""Bobby Fischer Against the World"". Even the early-90s film ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" tells us more about the man, and the phenomenon than ""Pawn Sacrifice"" does.""Pawn Sacrifice"" is really a big waste of time and resources. The producers badly missed the mark here. The one bright spot is Liev Schreiber who is a perfect Boris Spassky. Frankly, they should have just made a film about Spassky with Schreiber in the lead. Schreiber is one of our very best actors.What is most troubling about this film, as well as many films these days, its attempting to revise history in a way that is most palatable to the masses. This film really misses the point of Bobby Fischer's' life.",Pawn Sacrifice
71,wrightiswright,It's not always black and white (lol),7,15 December 2017,"What use is winning, if it costs one man his mental health?"" I'm sure this phrase or one like it was coined for the sake of this movie. It features Toby McGuire as real life Chess Champion Bobby Fischer, who was once the greatest player in the world but sadly let the pressure of the game and the attention bestowed upon him slowly drive him to the brink of insanity. He's not the only one though: as we see from the irrational behaviour of his Russian Grandmaster final opponent later on, the rigours of such a complicated strategic game can affect anyone, if they let it take over their existence to the extent as shown here.You don't have to appreciate the finer points of chess to derive enjoyment from Pawn Sacrifice. It would probably help, but the themes of Cold War anxiety and obsessively having to be 'the best' are more universal, and should make it appeal to a larger crowd. McGuire proves he can be so much more than just a webslinger, and we feel every inch of his paranoia as the film goes on: his character shuts himself off from the world, always thinks he's being watched, refuses to eat food unless it's prepared in front of him... one of the earliest 'conspiracy theorists', perhaps?Anyone familiar with the real-life story knows that this movie can't have a happy ending, as the final text during the episode so bluntly demonstrates. All the cheering from Fischer's family and adoring crowds won't change a thing to what occurred after his triumph, and we're left with the stark question: was it all worth it?In this viewers opinion, no. 7/10",Pawn Sacrifice
72,HanShotFirstGR,A good and interesting biography!,7,22 December 2020,"Plot:Set during the Cold War, American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer finds himself caught between two superpowers and his own struggles as he challenges the Soviet Empire.Analysis:Following the first steps to success of the famous American chess player Bobby Fischer this movie tries to tell an interesting story behind a game that included personal ambition, cold war political influence and mental ilnesses. Fischer was a tragic figure and this movie does a good job at giving people a taste of his unique personality. Although, this movie alters the real story a little to make it more cinematic and interesting, the general feeling and the main events are the same, so the viewer can undestand what was going on in Bobby's life at that time.Starting with the good elements, Tobey Maguire proves once more that he is capable at doing great stuff beyond Spiderman and his performance is really breathtaking, he combines that look and the whole feeling of Fischer and does a good job imitating his reactions. The arrogance in his words, the madness in his thoughts, the passion in his eyes, everything is perfect, an acting masterclass from Tobey and a great experience for the viewers. Everyone else was also pretty nice and especially, Liev Schreiber was really good as Boris Spassky, he delivered both sides of hus character and fullfilled his mission in this film.The story follows Fischer from his early years till the big match this movie was made for. Although, the first few minutes were interesting enough there was a huge drop of quality as the film continued until a certain point were it finally found the theme this whole story should have. There are some boring moments, especially until the middle of the movie, mostly because a biography needs to inform people about the details and some of them are really unnessecary. From the point that it gets the right focus, it's way more interesting and quite enjoyable.Pawn Sacrifice was directed by Edward Zwick, the man behind The Last Samurai and that was a huge advantage for this movie. Although, he didn't reach his full potential, there were many interesting choices of camera shots and the general feeling was kept on point, so despite not being his best work, this movie was another example of his great vision and talent. Great capture of feelings, appropriate colours and artistic camerawork are proof that this movie was nowhere near being the classic boring style of many biographies.After all, this is a biographic film. It manages to inform, entertain and give a good taste of society's backround during this time period. It's a full and good experince that although it won't blow your mind, it will keep you interested till the end and will give you enough information to make you look up the story of Bobby Fischer's life. It sacrifices some entertainment to tell the whole story, so some scenes especially in the first half are kinda boring but as the whole story enters the final act, it's way better.Conclusion:It's a great movie, especially for chess fans, it's a great start to make someone search this man's accomplishments, beliefs and life, something that is a result of great acting and direction that really gave this film something special. It could've definetely been more well-written but it's good enough for a nice and memorable experince and a motivation to learn about a great athlete and a troubled man.Rating: 7.5/10",Pawn Sacrifice
73,Bofsensai,'Based on' what? Meandering travesty?,3,23 July 2016,"What's the purpose to invest your (life's)time to watch any film?Cinematic / artistic depiction; tell a story; human endeavour in portrayal acting chops? If so, this film fails on two out of three and on that third (the last), even then is from an incredibly miscast T. Maguire - which affirming what other reviewers here have noted, in that not only his stature (in real life he towered over Spassky) but that when you see archival footage of the real Bobby, it's absolute obvious it should have been Nic Cage as a shoo-in to play the temperamental genius, even more so when you know of Cage's maniacal over-acting style of late which would have been ideal to represent the paranoid troubled Fischer.What about the other two failures then? Cinematically dull, jump shots and ponderously unwinding to what should have been the nail biting '72 Reykjavik held chess championship finale mind games only really briefly hinted at with (just) one shot of Maguire looking as though trying to put the hex on Spassky, which is exactly how many contemporary observers thought contributed to his crushing victory over him; even the famous Icelandic location, in which Fisher (supposedly) disappeared into for the odd no-show second game, little is made cinematically of its legendary landscape - one wandering along road scene when TM / BF is then met by a car  and that's it .. which leads onto story: as any film fan knows a 'based on a true story', ostensibly a bio-pic, is supposed to be marginally more reliable than 'inspired by', but as other reviewers here point out, (most notably 'Susie Bogus') this is almost a travesty of what really was likely: so much that, to me, the scriptwriters were either arrogant, or simply couldn't care less, about much fact at all, and yet of which there is plenty of archival material to reference: by which, I would advise you ignore this – for other than that last 'reel' / 20+ minutes when it finally does begin to excitingly represent the sort of real world politik shenanigans that seemed to accompany the erstwhile niche game of chess at that time, still it ends on only the fourth game – not, arguably, the real clincher 21st 'overnighter' where surely there was just as much drama as Spassky realised his position was so hopeless he was to finally concede the championship to his opponent, the lone hero (even Kissinger called him to patriotically carry on for American superiority against state machine drilled Soviets !) BF, which the film purports to represent: since, well, after that (only 4th) match, the story build up just closes up (did they run out of funds? Lose interest?), so that all the real mystery and intrigue on how Fischer's subsequent life developed is merely summed up in lame end credit captions.Interested in BF? Then instead I would recommend the far more revealing/informative 'Bobby Fischer Against the World' of Liz Garbus' documentary effort from the always reliable HBO imprimatur. Most disappointing travesty of efforts.",Pawn Sacrifice

The first forty minutes or so stand as a background with a fast-forward narration from Fischer's childhood through his adulthood as a prodigy. The second half is dedicated to the famous Reykjavik chess match with Spassky. Before seeing the movie, I quickly went through the wikipedia article about Bobby Fisher and honestly, found it more interesting than the film itself. Bobby Fisher certainly had an interesting life with ups and downs from his birth to his death and it would be impossible to capture all the important milestones of his life in 115 min. So, the film correctly focused on the culmination of his professional career in 1972. However, despite all the embellished drama over the match, the depiction of the events with a style reminiscent of Rocky Balbao series seems too familiar. Besides that, the hiccupy flow of the movie fails to keep the audience attached. Tobey's acting was good but his potrayal of Fischer as a sociopath went a bit overboard.",Pawn Sacrifice
76,brutzel,Quite Engaging,7,28 January 2016,"This is based upon a true story. Chess Prodigy Bobby Fischer (Toby Mcguire) becomes a household name during the Cold War years as he believes he is the best chess player in the world and his goal is to beat the Russian champion Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber). He is somewhat paranoid believing he is being spied on by both governments: Russia and the United States. When a movie comes out and claims to be a true story we really don't know all the facts. Such is the case here. Let's say we get a smattering of the truth and this is contrasted between what we knew from the newspapers and TV broadcasts had we lived during those 1970s Cold War years . And if not, there is always Wikipedia to fill in some blanks. A chess match between Fischer and Spassky was considered to be the Super Bowl of chess. The whole world was interested. What intrigues us mostly are the rules or boundaries that Fischer demands before he sits with Spassky. Will he get away with his demands? Will he show up if his demands are not met? How does Spassky feel about these distractions? We see Fischer beat many worthy opponents, but the goal is always Spassky. What we are drawn to are facial expressions of everyone in the movie, but in particular: Fischer and we cannot look away. These facial expressions are the pull in this story. That and his rebellion against almost everything and it is what keeps us engaged. Is he genius or just mad? You decide. Fischer's behavior can be traced back to childhood when his anti-war mother probably instilled in him that no one can be trusted. (you're just saying, right?)Looking for bugs we often see Fischer rip up just about everything in his rooms and one would think that someone would ask him, ""how many bugs have you found?"" Never happened. (that we know of)As we go along we see 2-friends try to help Fischer to be more reasonable. We see lawyer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Father Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard) fail at almost every attempt. Nothing they do gets through to Bobby Fischer.In 2011 there was a documentary: Bobby Fischer Against the World and that should have been the title for this movie or something akin as the one we have now is too passive. Fischer's struggles were against the world as this movie shows. See?Soooo who won the big match between Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky? I believe it's your move.

Also starring Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg, Pawn Sacrifice dramatizes Fischer's struggles with genius and mental illness, and the rise and fall of a kid from Brooklyn who captured the imagination and attention of the world.I know what most of you are thinking, a movie about chess? Believe me it's not as bad as it sounds. There's actually a lot to be had here. I will say that the chess-related scenes, although minimal, were well done but there is much more to the story than that. What we get to see the most is the ""rise and fall"" of Bobby, from his humble beginnings as a kid, to a young adult chess champion with some good old fashioned Russian communist undertones and cold war paranoia sprinkled throughout. I found these parts a little bland and boring based on the performances of the child actors playing young and teen Bobby (Aiden Lovekamp and Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) and the slightly cheesy story. I found both of them both quite obnoxious and a little annoying and some of their dialogue was cheesy as well. Luckily we don't spend too much time with them as most of the film takes place during Bobby's adult years. These are the better moments of the film as I found that Tobey Maguire did the best at depicting Bobby Fischer's eccentric personality and paranoia of the Russians and Boris Spassky who were his most formidable opponents. I thought he was pretty good throughout but again, he did have his cheesy moments. I will admit that it was hard for me not to think about Peter Parker while watching. I wish they could have explored that angle a little more as you never really got an idea (or at least I didn't) of how evil and menacing they were and despite how good Liev Schreiber was as Spassky, I wish we could have seen more of him. Also the cold war undertones spent most of the time in the background, just giving us an idea of the time in which the film was taking place. I wish the film could have spent more time embracing the whole cold war thing. Like I said, the chess scenes were good but I wish there could have been more as a lot of Bobby's matches happened off screen. I also liked Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg in their supporting roles as Father Bill Lombardy and Paul Marshall. They had great chemistry together will Lombardy as Bobby's coach and Marshall as Bobby's lawyer who appeared to be connected with the government somehow but that connection was never explored. I was not a fan of the ending either and explaining why would spoil the story if you are unaware of Bobby Fischer's story. You don't really have to know much about him before seeing this which was nice. Overall, I thought this was a good movie for what it had but I thought it could have been a touch better.Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Pawn Sacrifice
79,FabledGentleman,"Delivers nothing new, but still quite enjoyable.",7,10 December 2015,"This movie is told in a linear and safe way, without showing anything new. There has already been made several documentaries about Fischer and the game on Iceland in 1972, and this movie pretty much delivers the exact same story, just in different wrapping.But it is exiting to watch, and both Schreiber and Maguire delivers good performances. But a big screen film about the two best chess players in the world at the time, playing some of the most famous chess matches of all time, and being told this linear and ""typical"" is a bit disappointing. Also the movie does not explain all that well why certain moves are good or bad, but makes up for it by just focusing on the facial expressions of the actors. As an easy way out, sort of.I can understand the movie didn't have time to teach everyone how to play chess, but i think they went to easy on this to be honest. A movie called pawn sacrifice, not showing more of how the game itself is played, is a downer. You'd expect the film to be a bit more ""nerdy"", and would capture more of the battle on the board, not just another communist vs USA movie. But of course it was all about that as well. Especially in the media and in many peoples minds.I just felt the movie was taking some easy shortcuts, but it is told in a safe and ordinary fashion, and never really gets boring, it is very exiting at times, and i enjoyed parts of it quite much.And for those who don't know much about Bobby Fischer and the dramatic finale on Iceland in 1972, this movie is a good way to learn more about it.

80,barev-85094,Who would have believed a chess match could be so gripping on screen!,10,14 October 2015,"PAWN SACRIFICE, Biography of a Mad American Chess Prodigy Viewed at the Jameson Cinefest in Miskokc, September 2015, By Herbert Rodin Pevner-Deleon""Pawn Sacrifice"" the masterful biopic of the bumpy life of highly controversial American chess prodigy Bobby Fisher did not cash in on any prizes at the Miskolc festival, but to me it was easily the highlight of the festival week. Okay, I came of age intellectually during the Bobby Fisher years, always admired his rebellious spirit and sheer brilliance, played a little chess myself. and can therefore relate to this picture from a personal perspective, but aside from that, this is a meticulously constructed docu-drama with an uncanny Oscar worthy performance by Toby McGuire as Fischer, most skillfully steered through the historical Cold War setting by veteran Hollywood director, Edward Zwick.Above all Mcguire, who is rather short of stature and does not physically resemble the tall handsome Fischer in the least, nevertheless nails Fischer's complex fuming, unpredictable, mercurial character and personality so thoroughly that physical resemblance becomes a moot point as the story progresses. The film traces Fischer's life from a troubled childhood in Brooklyn (with outstanding juvenile roles) up through national celebrity as a young chess wizard, international political celebrity when he confronts Russian Chess grandmaster Boris Spassky at the height of the Cold War in Reykjavik in 1972, and finally, his decline into paranoid obscurity in his antisemitic anti-American later years.The electrically charged chessboard battle of the titans in Iceland -- billed at the time as ""The Match of the Century"" and symbolically as a major superpower Cold War confrontation, is the centerpiece of the current film -- amazing that a series of chess games can be so action packed and full of suspense on screen -- kudos to Director Zwick.The title of the film refers to a well known chess move in which one of the eight pawns is sacrificed to gain a temporary strategic advantage. In this case it is clearly meant to resonate with Bobby's own sacrifice on the alter of American ""justice"" when he defied a State Department ban on travel to Jugoslavia in 1992 to engage in a nostalgic rematch with Spassky. Fischer won the rematch in Belgrade but had his passport revoked and subsequently became a refugee from American Law for the rest of his life -- bouncing around incognito from country to country behind a full beard he had grown as a disguise.For a time he took up refuge in Chigasaki, Japan, under the tutelage and protection of Go expert Waclaw Lukasiewicz, but was arrested by the Japs and threatened with deportation, until Iceland finally offered him asylum and full citizenship. By now, totally freaked out (never emotionally stable in the best of times) and Convinced that not only the CIA, but the Russian MVD and the international Jewish Conspiracy as well, were all out to get him, he constantly made vicious anti-American and vitriolic anti- semitic statements -- the latter in despite of (or because of) his own Jewish background. Fischer died alone in Reykjavik in 2008 at the age of 64 a raving maniac in a full white beard -- in the very city where he had reached the pinnacle of his fame 36 years before. In a detailed assessment of the film long term Fischer friend and associate Sam Sloan has pointed out a number of minor historical inconsistencies (exact names and dates and slightly variant chess moves) but was very moved by Mcguire's tremendous portrayal of Bobby the man and the overall quality of the picture, both as entertainment and a powerful document of a most intriguing and important American life, now all but forgotten.",Pawn Sacrifice
81,AliceofX,Uneven Drama,6,1 October 2015,"Pawn Sacrifice is a good enough drama to leave you well entertained but not good enough to leave a deep, lasting impression. It is terribly uneven for one thing and can't decide if it wants to be a biography of Bobby Fischer or a story of that moment, their game, and it's meaning for that time. Is it about the game of chess or a man's descent into paranoia and madness? It undecidedly wavers between the various points and can't make them come together to a satisfying whole.That said there is nothing particularly bad about Pawn Sacrifice. Even though the story is mediocre the cast all give good performances. Tobey Maguire especially stands out by creating a character that is a brilliant yet arrogant genius slowly loosing his senses, more pitiable than likable. He is the most memorable thing about this film.Paranoia is the one thing that the movie does really well. It creates an interesting atmosphere of fear and distrust. But in the end there is nothing that really shines about this film and that is always kind of sad about biographical films because it is after all someone else's life story that you are using.Overall Pawn Sacrifice is a decent film, solid entertainment, but nothing to make you want to rush to the theatres.",Pawn Sacrifice

Excellent performances by Maguire, Schreiber and especially Sarsgaard, who was the character I identified with the most. I'm guessing most of the subtle humor wasn't obvious, to most--some of it being Chess humor. The movie perfectly portrays the fact that we'll never know how much of Bobby was show and strategy, and how much mental problems.Excellent to outstanding use of music, especially ""White Rabbit"" by Jefferson Airplane from 40+ years before--which beyond doubt had to have been written and performed expressly for this move. If they'd have included ""One Night in Bangkok"", at least in the credits, it'd have finished it off exquisitely, ""I get my kicks above the waistline, Sunshine""---but I'm obviously in a very small minority.P.S.

83,Jerominator,"Better Than Expected, Great Subject Matter.",8,31 December 2015,"Was hesitant to watch this - didn't like the casting of Maguire as Fischer. Ended up watching it anyway out of curiosity as this story has intrigued me for many years. I still think Maguire was the wrong choice to play Fischer. I would like to have seen Ryan Gosling or a younger Josh Lucas attempt it. At least somebody who could carry off that particular New York accent as that was one of his hallmarks for me. But that notwithstanding, if Tobey was the only choice available then I think he did a hell of a good job. I really enjoyed this. Edward Zwick knows how to put a movie together. Great supporting performances from Sarsgaard, Stuhlbarg and Schreiber. Having followed the story before I got the general impression they were trying to remain faithful to what happened at the chess championship in '72. I'm not sure how much of the mental illness stuff I buy. Clearly there was some kind of paranoia going on there - and the film deals with that well - but I think a lot is projected onto this after the fact. Secondary gains. A lot is conveniently bundled into the mental illness bucket which may just have just been the man's world view. And I think that is disrespectful to a brilliant man who is no longer here to defend himself. But that's not so much a criticism of the film as the general view of Fischer out there now. That said, I think this particular film probably handled it more respectfully than most would have done. So overall it was a lot better than expected. Definitely worth a watch - it's an extraordinary real life story about the extremes of obsession required to compete at that level, and the toll that it can, and often does, take.

A 7/10 is usually what people give a movie if it is basically uninspiring, does not really catch their attention and is simply something they watched once and will never watch again. This movie fits that role. It is the story of bobby Fischer. Told from a perspective that he was completely nuts with mental illness and it revolved around communism. While a historical point that he was indeed stricken by mental illness is very true, pinning it on this Soviet communist paranoia is a bit stretching it. The acting of the movie was OK, the script was fairly well done, but no one is going to be talking about this movie around the water cooler and there are reasons for that. It's a very bland movie. It may possibly catch your attention for a one time watch, but it is simply a one off movie. Good for a DVD night at home, but I wouldn't go standing in line to go see it on the big screen paying tons of money for tickets.",Pawn Sacrifice

He did it perfectly although, a part of me still thinks he's not the perfect actor for Bobby Fischer. He's the best and original Spider-Man for sure but I think there could've been a more suited man for Robert James Fischer. It was a great documentary. I wish they taught us just a little bit of chess; made it a little bit educational because it's the reason I wanted to watch a Chess movie. To learn more about it but don't get me wrong!

88,stanrogersmith,"Wouldn't Classify it as a Checkmate, More of a Stalemate",8,23 December 2015,"I'll start out with one thing that kept nagging at me as I watched the movie - Tobey Maguire. Now, I like Tobey and I think he's fine. I do however think he was miscast here. Fischer was a fairly big man - lanky, well over 6ft tall, and from what I've read of him, his personality seemed bigger than what Tobey portrayed. Now, that being said, I did like the movie and apart from the peripheral story line, I think the Reykjavik showdown was well done and mostly accurate. I felt that Liev did a fine job playing Spassky. I did think that the end should have been somewhat different. Instead of just jumping right to his paranoid slide into dementia, they could have explained better how he dropped out and forfeited the title to Karpov and the circumstances surrounding that. However, if you're interested in seeing a well done movie, this is worth a watch. You can then investigate further if there were omissions or false narratives, as others have opined.",Pawn Sacrifice
89,PrashunChakraborty,The usual mix of good and bad that haunt Edward Zwick films,7,25 September 2015,"Edward Zwick has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, in my opinion he makes terribly flawed melodramatic films but they are very entertaining, engaging and likable because they take themselves seriously despite having logic flaws, case in point - Legends of the fall, The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond. While Pawn Sacrifice is not as good as these previous Edward Zwick films I mentioned it's still a very decent, watchable film. Tobey Maguire is in peak condition as the eccentric but genius chess legend Bobby Fischer, an Academy award nomination worthy performance, people have been paying attention to what he has been doing outside of Spiderman and the good work just keeps on coming. Liev Schreiber plays his nemesis and antagonist, the that time chess world champion Boris Spassky and delivers a good restrained performance compared to Maguire's loud and flashy Bobby Fischer. Good film but there are cheesy moments which have always hung over Edward Zwick's films like grim music playing when Russians win, and cheerful music plays when Americans win, I found this to be rather simple, childish and manipulative in an otherwise a decent film, the audience is smart enough to pick sides but Zwick insists on telling us which one to root for. There are some other daftly executed scenes in the film as well which hurts the film's quality. I spoke to my Dad after watching the movie and according to him, movie is still a bit restrained in showing how crazy Bobby Fischer got regarding antisemitism and conspiracy theories, truly a mad genius who did four chess moves ahead of his opponent and went to the hotel pool to relax while his opponent is still struggling to grasp what just happened. India's own Vishwanathan Anand has claimed Bobby Fischer to be the greatest chess player of all times.",Pawn Sacrifice
90,targa9,Watch only if you are completely ignorant of who Bobby Fischer was,5,5 July 2016,"This biopic reminded me of ""Ali""--it ran through all the obvious parts of a famous man's life, parts you could glean from reading a Wikipedia bio, threw in some over-dramatic music and a backstory about ""family"" and viola! --biopic to order.If you are clueless about who Bobby Fischer was, then you will probably like this film, because you won't roll your eyes at all the chess clichés, you won't get bored at being shown the obvious things about Fischer (such as the details around the 1972 Reykjavik match), and you will probably enjoy the novelty of the whole thing.But who are we kidding? This event happened 44 years ago. If you don't know about it by now, you are either very young or you live under a rock. The film did not really try and show any INSIGHT into Fischer; it just replayed the same record that anyone who knows ANYTHING about Fischer already knew. But even then, they took liberties that were not only inaccurate, but unnecessary and just distracting.First of all, Bobby Fischer was a man from BROOKLYN. Everything about the way this guy walked and talked showed he was a city kid, a real NEW YAWKAH. Did you get that sense from Tobey's impression? I didn't. Tobey didn't really sound all that Brooklyn-ish. In the famous Cavett interview, the real Fischer bragged, but he did it in a way that was a bit endearing. Tobey instead made him sound like an ass.Second, Fischer was tall and lanky, and even gaunt-looking because of that, yet Tobey was short and puffy-faced. Bad casting. Alexander Saarsgaard (not Peter, as in the movie!) would have been a much better casting choice.Third, Spassky was a consummate gentleman. He never spoke to Fischer like that during a game, or flipped over chairs to inspect them, and I didn't buy the hotel room tantrum, which was really a transparent device to make it appear that even Spassky was sick of the Soviet control.Fourth, Fischer received a cheap plastic set when he was younger and used to play a lot with his sister, and then IN THE CLOSET. Instead they show him sitting on the bed with a very nice wooden set, and the next thing you know, he's beating strong club players. The entire youth of Bobby Fischer was quickly skimmed over, although I did very much like the part about the Russian mother, although I have a hard time believing they were self-professed Jews, esp. with the rather sloppy behavior of the mother.Fifth, his second Lombardy, although he was a former priest, did not go around wearing his priest outfit, esp. to Reykjavik. Sixth, to say game 6 was the ""greatest chess game ever played"" is quite pretentious! I can think of a particular Marshall game which is more exciting and filled with more nuance. Seventh, I don't buy Fischer losing his virginity to some hottie in the hotel; they could at least have made him more charming if they're going to embellish like that. Finally, and this is most important--Fischer's mental demise was not really that pronounced at Reykjavik. Yes, he complained and was a prima donna, and suspected the Russians of cheating. But he didn't go full-bore on the Jews and the Zionist conspiracy thing until years later. The film was not ambitious enough to explore possibly WHY Fischer turned into a loon; it was complacent and even eager to just SHOW his looniness.The acting was decent. And the whole story--framing it as a cold war battle between the US and Soviet Russia, was fitting, but easy--esp. when they simply interspliced a lot of period footage and music between the scenes. Avoid if you already know about Fischer's story and are a chess player!",Pawn Sacrifice
91,mmendez-22089,PERfecTion,10,28 September 2015,"Last night I underwent what is now one of my top favorite screenplays of the year; started out on the Hollywood's 2009 Blacklist, PAWN SACRIFICE took me through the insecurities and stress in the mind of the worlds greatest chess master, Bobby Fischer.The unbeatable young adult, is portrayed by the king of the craft, Tobey Maguire who does a sensational job. He gets away with the Brooklyn accent as well as the ill-temper that gets to his head every five minutes. These are my favorite kind of films (as I have mentioned in my previous review for: Love and Mercy) where our main character undergoes a series of mental breakdowns just so that s/he can get his/her way.We follow the life of Bobby Fischer, from his adolescence, beginning as a ""chess prodigy"" to his wonderful stand against the Russian government for permission to face their top chess competitors, since they contained the greatest ones in the world. As the film goes on, we come to recognize Fischer's sickness and how he is oblivious to his actions. Or maybe he sees himself doing these things, but enjoys that his mind going nutso. **Why would any human-being want to go through such pressure? Well, that is why I would say, ""watch this movie to find out."" I think he has a great purpose and am very proud that they took this SCREENPLAY out of the Blacklist. People need to hear the ""athletes"" story and how hard he worked to accomplish what he did.I would also like to give MAJOR PROPS to, the one and only , Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man, Boardwalk Empire, Blue Jasmine) who played the roll of Bobby's manager, Paul Marshall. To me, he was like the ""Paul Giamatti"" of Love and Mercy; making every second well-worth-watch. He can also, be the ""Paul Giamatti"" of Straight Outa Compton, which he honestly plays similar rolls of. // I would also like to acknowledge the work done by Liv Schreiber and Peter Sarsgaard; equally very talented performers and contributed perfectly to the film.I give this picture a 10 out of 10.",Pawn Sacrifice

93,peter-eldon,Pawn Sacrifice - Who is the true pawn in this game?,6,15 September 2015,"Welcome to the complex, neurotic and paranoid mind of the quirky and tragic Bobby Fischer, played by the impressive Toby Maguire. In this true story you see the young chess prodigy become a pawn for the American government during the Cold War against the Russians while battling his own madness. The tensions that made this genius believe that the Jews and Russians conspired in consistently trying to make him fail that led to his true fall and his anti-semitic views. Director Ed Zwick's Pawn Sacrifice gives a snapshot of time in this Cold War clash set during the 1972 World Chess Championship in Iceland. Following the build up and actual game to what is known as the worlds best ever played chess match* between the one and only American chess world champion Bobby Fischer and his Russian counterpart Boris Spassky.Liev Schreiber plays the very cool and reigning chess champion Spassky, speaking every word of his dialogue in Russian, a language he didn't know at all before taking on this role. Schreiber and other supporting roles by Peter Sarsgaard his (Fischer) confidante and ""chess whisperer"" and Fischers lawyer played by Michael Stuhlbarg should all be thought of for an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. As in earlier roles Toby Maguire delivers a well executed performance that should could lead to an Oscar as well. He also produced the film together with director Ed Zwick and Gail Katz after spending the better part of a decade developing the film for his production company, Material Pictures. The only real little down-side about the movie was that it tended to be a bit repetitive leaving it a bit to long.""It's really the free world against the lying, cheating, hypocritical Russians,"" - Bobby FischerRobert James ""Bobby"" Fischer born in Brooklyn was the man who won everything and achieved the highest price becoming world champion and a super star of his time. After all that success he derailed severely with his illness retiring from chess the same year he became world champion saying no to millions in commercial endorsements, loosing his world champion title and following legal trouble in his homeland of America because he violated U.S. restrictions on participating in chess events in Yugoslavia he got asylum in Iceland and died on January 17th 2008.* The match was played over 26 games with game 6 known as the best ever chess match played.",Pawn Sacrifice
94,charmaments,"A disjointed, mildly entertaining film filled with historical/biographical inaccuracies",6,18 January 2017,"This is the ultimate problem of historical or biographical films. Films exist on a scale, realistic on one end and Hollywood on the other. Most based on a true story films try to be in the middle. This one went too far the Hollywood side. Notice I didn't say ""entertaining"" - films can be completely realistic and entertaining and completely unrealistic and still be boring.The real Fischer is so interesting, so there was no need to reinvent a new person to tell the story. Fischer had a father figure who was in his life, he just didn't know it was his actual father. Fischer was interested in languages and learned them to read chess periodicals and was not one to go around saying ""Speak American"" to people. The film has Fischer choosing to lose his virginity to a prostitute, picking the person, time and place. He's completely in control. Even though in this same film he can barely control his emotions. In real life he met a girl during the tournament and he got ""caught up in women and sex"" to the point where it cost him the tournament, the only tournament failure in his career. Isn't that interesting enough to make a film out of it? Why change the story for change's sake?Anyway, other than random script issues, which later become editing issues, the story is the weakest part of this film.The rest is top notch. Production quality is high. Liev Schreiber, bravo, bravo, sir, on your Russian.The film, overall, is a highly polished, professionally produced mediocre picture.

95,khan_rado,Electrifying and intense,8,11 December 2015,"A wonderful depiction of Fischer's chess success, capturing in a perfect way his eccentric persona, game brilliancy and the atmosphere of the time.Many believe that this is a film about chess, while it actually is about the person behind the chess player and for that reason the film strays from giving explanations about game philosophy and every move shown and concentrates on characters and what they go through. In the centre of that focus is the eccentric Fischer with his ridiculous and pretentious demands, unnerving and arrogant behaviour and remarkable chess skills. Tobey Maguire nails the role perfectly and his performance is astonishing. A huge impression makes his never-short of emotions face which in some scenes is used as a substitute for dialogue.Another interesting thing to point out is that the character of Spassky is a bit undeveloped and he is more of a figure in the film rather than a real character and rightly so. This is intentional and is there to show that the real opponent of Fischer is not his chess one, even though it looks so, it's actually his own self, constantly torn apart between suspicion and paranoia mixed with a good portion of overconfidence and ambition.The whole film breathes the time it takes place in and that's a credit to the excellent choice of music and the use of authentic materials, such as videos, interviews, etc. It really shows the Cold War reality with the endless race on all fronts where a simple intellectual game becomes a confrontation point not between players but between nations.",Pawn Sacrifice
96,FeatherlessBiped,"Minor flaws & a couple larger ones, but true in spirit",8,26 September 2015,"I'm a chess master who grew up playing the game during the ""Fischer boom"" of the early 1970s, so I know Bobby's story well. This movie had an accurate ratio of genius to madness, and Tobey Maguire and Liev Schreiber gave worthy portrayals of Fischer and Spassky.Too many chess bits were nonsensical. Some examples:*Bobby playing a couple of absurd moves on the board while copying a master game from a book*Bobby plotting which defense to play with the black pieces in his first-ever game against Spassky, but then being shown playing the white pieces*his second, Bill Lombardy, saying Bobby wasn't playing his usual Sicilian Opening in a game where Bobby had the white pieces, when the Sicilian Defense is an opening that black plays*Bobby making a move on the board when that move had already been shown on the TV feed.The moves from the Fischer-Spassky match were generally correct, though Bobby didn't resign game 1 until more moves had been made than were shown in the movie.My biggest quibbles with the movie, though, concern two major influences on Fischer's career. One, the priest (and chess grandmaster) Bill Lombardy, is very different in real life from the way Peter Sarsgaard portrayed him. Rather than a slim, sharply groomed, drily philosophical figure, the real Lombardy is and was a beefier, more unkempt, more plainly spoken common-man type. This difference reminded me of how Ben Kingsley, in the film _Searching for Bobby Fischer_, played chess teacher Bruce Pandolfini as a stern, acerbic authority figure rather than the warm and humorous guy Bruce really is.The second influence is not misportrayed, but left out altogether. How can a film on Bobby Fischer not mention his long-time chess teacher Jack Collins, who turned young Bobby's primitive but promising chess style into a well-honed weapon (and did the same for Lombardy and some other leading masters of that era)? I know a movie can't include everything, but Collins was the greatest contributor to Fischer's meteoric rise.I give the movie makers credit for providing insights into Bobby's complex persona - and for refraining from pandering by showing more real footage of the crazed older Fischer at the film's end. A little more attention to chess accuracy, and the inclusion of a realer Lombardy and the unjustly neglected Collins, would have considerably polished this rough gem.",Pawn Sacrifice
97,thefilmlawyers,A very tingly performance by Spidey,7,2 October 2015,"Pawn Sacrifice, the new film by Ed Zwick (Blood Diamond) about American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire). It's a movie that certainly was going for the full Red vs. Blue of the Cold War and certainly gave you that if that's what you were after. You've got paranoia upon patriotism upon neurosis upon a little more paranoia. Mixed in of course with ""my phone's being wiretapped"". What to like about the film? Well, in one word the neuroticism. The performance of Tobey Maguire as the ever increasingly mad, and ever decreasingly sane Bobby Fischer was a standout. I, personally did not like his character, especially when it seemed that the success was getting to his head even before facing off against Liev Schrieber's Spassky. But not liking a character, doesn't mean that the character was badly played, in my mind, it was wonderfully played, but he gave the sense of me not wanting to get nowhere near him if we were to meet. However, the plot did keep jumping around and bringing in characters who we were to relate to, but would then unceremoniously disappear when the story shifted to the craziness of Bobby. Also, it's female characters were quite flimsy, where the issues that Bobby's sister may have had were completely ignored, and his mom was just there to play a socialite and later just a women to pan the camera to when need be. All in all, a safe movie with a great performance by Maguire, but the character that resonated with me more was Spassky.

100,peggyatthemovies,"The Chess ""Rock Stars"" of their time...",7,14 September 2015,"REVIEW ""PAWN SACRIFICE"" Q & A W/TOBEY MAGUIRE The story of chess great Bobby Fisher is definitely a complex one as we watch Bobby as a young child (Young actors Aiden Lovekamp and Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who play Fischer as a boy and teenager, are respectively completely convincing) growing up in the Washington Square area of Brooklyn already showing chess greatness but also showing how his paranoia builds with his mother Regina Fisher (Robin Weigert) holding secret communist party get togethers in their small apartment.Director Ed Zwick does well making this tense and gripping story which is for the most part set during the Cold War era between the U.S. & U.S.S.R. (aka Russia), Pawn Sacrifice is a very well acted and quite accurate portrayal of the oft demanding, arrogant, completely unstable and preening chess player Bobby Fisher, as it puts Tobey Maguire in the main role of Fisher when he was in his twenties. pawn sacrifice 2The film opens on Fischer in a state of disarray, panting and pacing around a hotel room, ripping open telephones to check if there are microphones inside. He is going slightly mad, and Fischer will not leave his room. He is paranoid from what is happening outside as the Cold War paranoia that is getting to the American chess grandmaster will be his downfall from life as we know it. As you watch his crazy decline of mental cognizance with Maguire truly inhabiting and embodying this character showing how he had a mind both incredible and dangerous as on the one hand he loved gloating to the public, on the other was a nuisance and nut in private.With the aid of two companions, lawyer Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) and Father William Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard), Fischer plans a trip to Iceland to play against the Soviets.Out of fear and apparent madness, Fischer does not show up for a world title match against his Russian foe, Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber), who is effortlessly cool in his portrayal here mostly just with looks as he doesn't have much dialogue. The fact that this film is quite historically accurate and with spectacular locations perfectly welded together, the scenes in Santa Monica and Beverly Hills being some of my favourite as they got the essence of the era down perfectly and beautifully, showing how these two guys were somewhat the rock stars of their respective countries in such a time of turmoil between the two countries.. along with the fact they make chess almost exciting makes the title perfectly fit with the reference to the sacrifice Bobby Fischer had to make, but because of his almost sheer genius, had the game going and ending how he wanted.Although the physical resemblance with the real chess players isn't spot on, that fact proves to be almost a moot point and unnoticeable with these hands down enveloping performances and truly, once the movie gets a hold of you, just sit back and enjoy the spectacle.Grade: B @pegsatthemovies peggyatthemovies.comPOST Q & A WITH TOBEY MAGUIRE & PRODUCER GAIL KATZ: Tobey noted what interested him most and attracted him to the role was seeing what Fisher's childhood had been about.. Noting that by age 15 he was already at the top of his game, but mentally, what he was doing was telling people his hotel room wasn't perfect or making crazy demands for quiet. It was mostly this that attracted him to the role. He & Gail delved into many long and lengthy stories about how the film got to be made most notably that they first had director David Fincher attached when they first started putting the picture together 9 yrs. ago and then when it became clear he wouldn't be able to do it when Tobey was ready to do it, he had a conversation with Ed Zwick who stepped in and did a fine job. He noted that it is somewhat a sports story but more a life story time capsule of what was going on in the world at the time.",Pawn Sacrifice

Its a piece of history that should be told, and passed on to future generations. Sadly, that won't happen with this movie. The directing and editing destroyed the film. You won't get more than a minute of normal viewing before the viewer is painfully removed from the experience by nausea inducing shaky cam, out of focus hyper close ups, and strobe lighting effects. And the makers of Pawn Sacrifice used all the amateur tactics that predictably pull the viewer out of the experience of enjoying a movie. In the end I made it less than 20 minutes in before I had to walk away because of nausea. I can understand directors who really want to be cool more than they want to make a watchable movie. What I have trouble understanding is why investors would through away cash producing a movie that about a third of the population can't watch without physically becoming ill. They've proved that these tactics decimate the income potential of a movie- and the IMDb ratings. Even if someone makes it all the way through, and enjoyed the story and performances, their body feels like the just sailed a canoe through hurricane leaving a generally dissatisfied feeling about the movie. Increasingly directors are finally starting to take notice that a lot of people really hate being assaulted at the movies. Yet, the investors knew what they were doing, and presented this movie for our review. Its a real shame. This could have been an award earning movie. Now its just another wasted shaky cam amateur production. I've seen teenagers with phone cameras produce more professional movies. How much money did they throw away on this experiment? I used to deduct 2-3 points from my rating for shaky cam because it was a new tool that producers want to explore, develop and integrate in to their story telling. I gave some slack because it was new. Now we're very familiar with the tactics, and the feedback is in. We know for a fact that very large numbers of the audience hates it- and won't watch it even if its a movie we really want to see. Now when a big budget movie comes out with this assaulting style of editing, it will never get better than a 2 on IMDb. And if I went to a theater to watch it, it will result in a refund and several online reviews. I hope that I have helped others avoid wasting their time, and a night of being sick. How long would a restaurant stay in business if they made a third of the clients sick? About as long as the amateurs who produced this movie will find investors for their next project.

104,totally-bogus,Imaginary Characters Grafted onto Real Names,1,4 October 2015,"The first thing you need to know about this film is that is not a ""true story"". It is not the story of Bobby Fischer, nor of other major characters. It states in the beginning that it is ""Based on a true story"". What that means is that they have taken skeletal details about Bobby Fischer's life and about his increasing paranoia and mental instability, and about his historic world championship match with Boris Spassky, and crafted imaginary but plausible characters and plot points which might have fit the known narrative. While the film is serviceable B movie fare, I have to give it my lowest rating because of the fundamental lack of honesty. If you want to make a film about an imaginary chess player and set it within a context of 20th century Realpolitik, fine, have at it. But let your film stand or fall on its own merits. Don't claim it to be the story of a real person, a historic person of immense importance, to give your invented story a gravitas it does not otherwise deserve. Start with the casting itself. As many have pointed out, Tobey Maguire is vastly different from Bobby Fischer. But so is Liev ""Ray Donovan"" Schreiber vastly different from Spassky. Everyone in the performing arts thinks about the difference between ""indicating"" and ""expressing"". The casting of this film is a blatant case of indicating the ""underdog vs the world"" cliché by casting frail little narrow shouldered Tobey as the underdog, and casting 21st century anachronism cut-and-ripped, 6-pack gym bunny Liev Schreiber as overdog Spassky. They even throw in a shirtless, fresh-from-the shower, rippling muscled Spassky to beat the point to death. The reality is that Fischer was 6'2 or 6'3, and that he himself was the first top grandmaster to devote himself to physical fitness and strength conditioning. He was in fact the physically intimidating one, as opposed to the sedentary schlump, Spassky. And Fischer knew it. He was also a bit of a bully. Hardly the false narrative being presented in this film, and one with much more subtlety and ambiguity. The film gives Fischer a highly altered childhood to fit its concocted narrative. It introduces young Fischer's chess wizardry with a scene where Fischer's mother, Regina, takes him to one of the top players in New York City. Regina states that she wants Bobby to lose, to discourage him to the point that he will give up the game. The reality is that Regina was worried that Bobby spent too much time alone studying chess, but she supported his passion to the point that she attempted to run want ads to find other children as playing partners, and she took him to talented adults to coach and develop his game. A film mother who wanted him to quit, vs the real mother who wanted him to excel? As I said, this is not a true story. The film does show us a ""seminal"" scene where young Bobby, studying chess in his room, is haunted by sounds of Regina and some anonymous lover in her room. He confronts her, demands to know where his unknown father is, drops an F bomb on her, and tells her he needs her to leave because he needs silence. Later scenes report that she has in fact departed, going to California and leaving him alone in the apartment as he demanded. There is no evidence that this confrontation happened. None. She did in fact leave him, but in cold-hearted self-interest, to pursue her medical studies. The later wave of scenes where she watches from afar are pure Hollywood clichéd fiction. The film shows no strong male presence in young Bobby's life. There was in reality one important man. Paul Nemenyi, a Hungarian born physicist, was as close to a father figure as Bobby ever had. Nemenyi came to visit young Bobby, took him on outings, and even paid for his schooling. He was an important figure in Bobby's life until he died when Bobby was 9. One can only imagine what this loss meant to Bobby. There's one other reason why Nemenyi belongs in the real story. He was Bobby Fischer's father. Regina never told Bobby, because of the stigma of a child born to a father who was not her husband. Bobby wanted to know where his father was, and Paul was right there, unknown. You want a gripping, emotional film about the real life of Bobby? That film is still waiting to be made.

105,chasebangerter,The Interesting Life of Bobby Fisher,8,27 November 2015,"From the director who brought us Glory, Edward Zwick gives us a movie about a prominent chess player with Pawn Sacrifice. Starring Toby Maguire, this is the story of Bobby Fisher as we get into a really intriguing history biopic about his life and how he became the greatest chess player in the world. In addition, the movie shows how he's dealing with paranoia and the way it's affecting his actions and thought process. Which is funny because he's already super cocky and to add that he's paranoid brings an interesting layer to his character. What Edward Zwick has done really well is that he captured the feel of the movie that it took place during the down years of the Cold War. Not only that, Tobey Maguire has done an excellent job playing as the paranoid genius. In a way, it reminds me of A Beautiful Mind where it is also about a genius that has a mental health issue. But if there's one thing to critique about this film is that I felt that I never got a real connection with the main character. I think if it spends in its opening scenes giving us a sense of not only who Bobby Fisher is, but how we can connect with him, it would turn from a good film to a great one. But I think the way it is, Pawn Sacrifice is a fascinating story about the life of Bobby Fisher. If you like biopics, this is worth checking out.",Pawn Sacrifice
106,areebkhan619,A nice tribute to a chess legend.,8,1 January 2015,"Tobey Maguire fits in the role of Bobby Fisher, and this movie is yet another example that the guy can act beautifully. The suspense builds up as if you are watching the match happen live in front of your eyes. What's more is that we see the paranoiac side of Bobby Fischer, a treat to see Maguire portraying. Although there is not much physical resemblance between Maguire and Bobby Fischer, but it is compensated by his award-worthy performance, and once the movie gets a hold of you, just sit back and enjoy. Again, I have to praise the performance of Tobey Maguire. Never seen before as star of biopic, the actor's hard-work paid off, and it's mainly the reason why I'm giving this movie a full rating, although the good acting of supporting characters do not go amiss. Liev Schreiber just won my heart with his performance. Enjoyable and interesting piece of work on the real incidents of the life of an evergreen chess legend. Worth watching, and worth recommending.",Pawn Sacrifice
107,songofvictory2011,Good biopic with some clichés (possible spoilers),7,1 November 2015,"I have to admit that if you aren't a chess player, this movie might not really interest you. While chess mastery signifies a certain level of intelligence, I concede, plenty of smart people have little to no interest in it. I think though that you don't have to be a daily chess player like myself to enjoy this movie. Biopics in general are not my favorite type of movie. Reading a good book on famous person is usually the better option. But who reads anymore, right?I'm not going to write a mini-biography of Bobby Fischer for this review. Chances are you know he is considered one of the greatest if not the greatest chess player the world has ever known. His life was consumed by chess to a staggering degree and almost certainly his obsession was detrimental to his mental health and personal relationships. The movie chronicles his descent into what could be called paranoid schizophrenia while he also had OCD. What I came away with was the idea that he became a prisoner of his obsession with chess: its own little universe of complex calculations and theories. Throughout the movie he seemed to show little interest in any other subjects spending nearly 14 hours everyday submerged in chess. As he battled the Russian chess masters, he became increasingly afraid of being spied on and even killed. His climactic 1972 chess battles with Boris Spassky, the Russian champ, seemed to push him to the limits of his psychological endurance.The plot follows the familiar biopic: early life and promise of great things, rise to power, series of setbacks and self doubt, triumphant return and film climax, and denouement with later life rap up. I don't really like the biographical notes at the end of a biopic because it seems slapdash and perfunctory. The actual newsreel footage of a clearly mentally unstable Bobby Fischer also seems out of place after watching Tobey Maguire inhabit the role. Overall, the acting was good though I'm no expert on acting. The film moves along pretty well without dissolving into tedium. I didn't notice many problems on the technical end: cinematography, editing, sound, etc. The ending however, just seemed sort of a let down. Then again, real life has a way of being anti-climatic. I don't think I'm a better chess player because of this movie. That would have been nice but unlikely. Its yet another tale of a genius teetering and then presumably falling into madness. I dislike using the term cautionary tale. Few of us ever approach the level of genius Bobby had. Yet, we all can become overpowered by our obsessions whatever they might be.",Pawn Sacrifice
108,fjfuatai-73355,Tobey,1,30 November 2020,What's wrong with this movie???? It's the pink elephant in the room casting a short guy to portray a tall guy. It's like casting Andrei the giant to play napoleon. Part of Fischer's aura was his long lanky fingers wrapped around a chess piece with lightning speed banging out genius moves.... he had physical presence because of his height and broad shoulders and how he would tower over a chess board analysing while standing up ...how can short guy pull that off??? Total 100% self indulgence on Tobey to cast himself as Fischer. The only actor that should have been offered the lead role is Nicholas Cage and the movie would have been a massive success.,Pawn Sacrifice
109,Jxfiles,Enigmatic and Captivating,8,4 April 2016,"Pawn SacrificeCaptivating, confounding, and utterly enthralling, Pawn Sacrifice is a gem of a film that deserves much more attention and praise than it is receiving. Set during the Cold War, Pawn Sacrifice follows what is perhaps the infamous Bobby Fischer's most memorable chapter, that of his showdown with then world champ and Soviet representative--Boris Spassky.The film does a great job of building the tension and setting the stage for what was a very precarious geopolitical time. A time when tensions were so high with the Russians that even a chess match would take on significance. The performances were strong, this being the best role I've ever seen Tobey Maguire in. The dialogue is rich, the characterizations nuanced, and the scenes well executed. In the end we are left both admiring and vexed at the enigma of Bobby Fischer, and that's undoubtedly how it should be. 4/5 Stars",Pawn Sacrifice

111,reflectionofpower,If you know nothing of chess ...,2,17 February 2021,"Then you would know that Fischer was not this way during his climatic peak to winning the World Championship. The stress on this movie was on his mannerisms, thought processes and the way he reacted in chess & social interactions.They were greatly exaggerated for the most part. This individual do more for chess to extol it to a higher ground, more $$ and exposure. The players of today thank him for that. To portray him in such a bad light considering when you got to know how he really was was a great contrast to what we see here. If you're looking for a half-truth movie about a chess player then it's your cup of tea but if you're looking for the real Robert Fischer story then move on.Highly recommended is Frank Brady's book, ""Bobby Fischer: Profile of a Prodigy"" or the highly technical,""A Psychobiography of Bobby Fischer"" by Joseph G.

Because these sort of films where the lead propagandist usually get a lot of critical acclaim because the actor played a crazy person really well. And thats what this is. Its an interesting story about how the media and mediocrity can turn sports into a vessel of patriotism for the middle class. A sports as dull as chess nonetheless. Maguire usually plays innocent polite characters and I was pleasantly surprised by how well he played a rude egoistic sob. The matches shown were surprisingly exciting and Maguire's quirks were so believable that you become irritated by them. The director Edward Zwick has done some masterpieces in the past like The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond. This one unfortunately doesn't even come close to those. I wouldn't recommend this if you are really looking for some entertainment, but if you have limited options then probability is, this might not be the worst one.",Pawn Sacrifice
113,contactdanielphillips,"It Should Say ""Based on a true story?""",1,10 December 2015,"I found it very disappointing that the creators of this movie pointed Bobby Fischer out to be a lunatic rather than having the guts to make a more balanced, controversial film. The Hollywood-tinted spectacles this film plops on the viewers faces fail to explain how Mr Fischer was used like a pawn himself before being cast into the darkness when his country was finished with him.The film gave us a few tiny, weeny little clips right at the end to skip over the more important details of how he was treated after the Cold War.He doesn't like chess, he is more interested in exposing the lies of the American Government. He called out George Bush for being a lunatic and a law-breaker while passionately claiming all he wants is ""the truth"".That doesn't sound like a raving madman to me, nor does being paranoid playing world championship chess against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Especially with a family from Russia.The acting was fine, Spiderman and Wolverine's brother did well to keep their mutant abilities in check for some good chess.I've given this movie 1 star primarily because it felt like Hollywood propaganda and a cowardly cop-out.It should say ""Based on a true story?""",Pawn Sacrifice

The story is plenty of mistakes, and things that never happened.
Important characters of the match are forgotten (Like the good icelandic friend and Fischer´s bodyguard Sammy) and others are invented.
But the most terrible thing is the McGuire performance. The physical resemblance with Fischer is zero (teh actor small stature vs Fischer taller figure, for instead) and his acting is not accurate. Fischer was plenty of sense of humour and always smiling in public. This is a Mcguire´s project so the basic chess mistakes of the film are this actor responsible.

I thought he did a good job of depicting Bobby's paranoia/fear in some scenes though. Someone mentioned Nicolas Cage here, OK if this was the 90s, way too old...Christian Bale would have been better IMO...But, I think once Fincher dropped it they should have pulled the plug. Shame.

117,ralphzoontjens,A Look into the Top of the Chess World and Convincing Drama,9,5 August 2020,"Probably one of the best biographical documentary films / dramas about a chess player living in an intense period of time. And Robert James Fischer definitely belongs in the Top 5 players that have ever lived. I like how they interwove a few scenes of the actual Bobby Fischer at the end and how the chess scenes were mostly accurate. They show some of his novelties however they didn't pay attention to his famous knight maneuvers, together with Morphy's the best in history. Instead the producers focused on the Cold War bout with the Russians. Which is a nice decision for a movie. But they could at least have shown the trap involving the bishop sacrifice from B3 to F7 and winning the queen on D8, which he funnily enough simply obtained from one of those Russian chess magazines, but his GM opponent didn't know.Also in reality, Fischer didn't resign after blundering his bishop in Fischer vs. Spassky Game 1, hoping for inaccuracies, but at that level he indeed might as well have. All in all this is a very good portrayal of the social and mental difficulties tagging along with the full dedication to a potentially brain-wrecking game, and ignoring life's other opportunities such as building relationships. It also shows an outstanding acting performance by Tobey Maguire.",Pawn Sacrifice

Unfortunately, this movie is so both fastpaced and slow that it manages to skip through any suspense or depth and yet really drags on at parts. For people who just want to enjoy a movie, Pawn Sacrifice is more confusing than Harry Potter 4. You don't get to explore the historical context within the movie nor does it really dive into Fischer's psychosis.The movie really moved me however as I understood the depressing mood of the US at the time and the tension that any contact with the Russians could result in nuclear war. But for anyone who doesn't know these things, it looks like a magical world where people are holding their breath waiting for two people to make their moves on a chess board. This isn't eisenhower and Lenin playing, nor is it Obama and Putin. Although it does mention the idea of ideological struggle between capitalism and communism, it doesn't persist long enough for uninformed viewers to understand the importance of proxy matches between east and west. If you're young or fell asleep during history class (especially for those in an international audience from nations not really impacted by the cold war ... aka 98% of countries) you're continuously confused about why the focus on chess, as artful a game as it is.Anyway, it was a good movie and decently directed for what they were given (110 mins running time I believe) and my angst is really against reviewers on IMDb that insist the film makes chess seem exciting. No it doesn't and for those who aren't waiting for this poor young man from Brooklyn to grow up to be a sensational hero for the US, his personal foibles and struggles don't really resonate.In fact I guess I can somewhat agree with the guy that was rooting for the Russians.

Sadly, beyond the superficial, the movie does not deliver. Nor does it have to, for the casual fan or those uninterested in chess, but for those already aware of the games, Fischer's antics, and the history, it is merely an honest retelling of a story already experienced - like watching Aladdin in a 3D-animated 2009 version by different animators.",Pawn Sacrifice

Fischer, one of the greatest chess players of all time (if not the greatest) deserves much more credit.There're many inaccuracies regarding chess history. First of all, there are only two soviet grandmasters in Santa Monica chess tournament , world champion Petrosian and Spassky. A player called Ivanovich simply didn't exist.Spassky, always wearing sunglasses in the film , is shown as an arrogant person. Indeed, he is good natured, likable man. Also, Fischer and Spasky are not enemies but good friends, respecting each other and their friendship dates back to Mar Del Plata chess tournament in 1960. Spassky was in the Fischer's list of ten greatest grandmasters of all time.There is not much physical resemblance between Tobey Maguire and Bobby Fischer. Fischer is handsome, tall. In the film, he is depicted as arrogant, inconsiderate, semi-insane person, somewhat paranoid. Actually, this is not true. For instance, in Curaçao candidates tournament, Tal, one of the contestants and former world champion, became ill (withdrew at the end) and only Bobby visited him in the hospital. Other four soviet grandmasters didn't even bother to visit their compatriots.Fischer didn't like the media and organizers not without a reason. Many of his problems stemmed from his strict adherence to his principles. Many times, media misinterpreted his statements. In 1961, a match between Fischer and Reshevsky, two strongest grandmasters in U.S. , was organized in L.A.. While score was 4-4, game was scheduled to 11 A.M instead of 5.00 P.M. without informing Fischer. Fischer always sticking to his principles quit the match without considering the prize money.True, Fischer hated Soviets though he had friends among soviet grandmasters like Tal, Stein. After realizing he was a real threat to the soviet chess hegemony, especially their strongest granmaster Botvinnik and Soviet press disdained him. Unintellectual, lopsidedly developed and uncommunicative. These were the words used by soviets. What can you expect from Fischer apart from hating? In the film, his great victories over Taimanov and Larsen both of whom were the super grandmasters at the time were not mentioned. Fischer won 6-0 against both grandmasters without a draw and it's unprecedented in the chess history.Finally, I think Fischer is the greatest American athlete in the 20th century. His I.Q. is 180.A great human being and a pure genius. Before him, many chess players died from hunger, did some irrelevant jobs to live like taxi driving etc. Chess players owe Fischer too much.R.I.P. Robert James Fischer.",Pawn Sacrifice
127,Meridianfrost,A massive failure of a film.,1,30 September 2015,"Before you read this, I'd just like to identify myself as someone who has always loved Bobby Fischer as one of the great artistic minds of our time. I play chess. Badly. And I am always fascinated by the enduring legend of Fischer in pop culture. With that being said, Pawn Sacrifice was one of only two films I have walked out of the theater after stomaching about as much as I possibly could. Without taking up too much of your time, I will attempt an explanation.This film has no tempo. From the moment the film begins, it is already swerving out of control, and unless the last 45 minutes of the movie somehow manages to regain a grasp on the cinematic wheel, never recovers. It begins with trying to draw viewers in to a realm of intrigue with Fischer and his family being watched by the federal government. Although this is an interesting facet of the Fischer story, it is completely ancillary to WHY they were being monitored by the FBI. The film just dumps you into their existence, being photographed and followed because of their supposed ""communist sympathies"" I invite all of my readers to familiarize yourselves with the Fischer story, especially Regina Fischer.Also, the film makes it seem like Regina was supportive of Bobby's gifts, but she was nothing of the sort. She knew that Bobby was mentally troubled, and took him to many psychiatrists to help to end his obsessive attitude toward chess. It was very dramatic, and took a toll on the entire family. The portrayal in the film is absurd.Another aspect of this film's multi-faceted deficit, is that it was technically, visually, and artistically bankrupt. The cuts were sloppy, and the dialogue was like watching molasses drip off the side of glacier. I didn't care about any of the characters. I was honestly so desperate for substance, that I wanted to know more about the bullet hustlers playing in central park. So you get it. I thought the movie was awful. I think I will conclude with the most important reason that it was awful, and that is the portrayal of Bobby Fischer. Tobey Maguire was a terrible choice for the lead. He did not possess the capacity to represent Fischer's brilliance and madness. What you end up with is a Fischer who is a petulant child half the time, and a dopey deer in the headlights the other half. His mental illness is the tragic aspect of his brilliance, and that is one of the things that made his story so special. This film failed to tell that story.",Pawn Sacrifice
128,poetssword,It's pretty great,9,17 November 2015,"Now I wasn't alive in the 80's when Fischer was rising in the world, so this is coming from someone who didn't even know the name Bobby Fischer until this movie. Now I need to say that I love this movie. It shows some of the struggles of his early childhood and his fascination with chess. His mother says that even if she takes the pieces away, ""he just keeps playing in his head."" Not only does this movie show Bobby Fischer's slow descent into madness and paranoia, and it does an excellent job of it, but it even goes so far as to explain why this happens. Apparently because of the sheer complexity of the game, chess masters who devote their entire lives to the game can't handle it. As the movie states, ""their are more forty move games than stars in the sky."" Thats crazy if you ask me. The cinematography is excellent and brilliantly shines in some scenes. I'm going to call out one in particular here. It was when Fischer was staying in the house before the championship match and his agent was trying to get in. His agent was knocking on the door trying to get in, but the way Bobby saw it was loud pounding on door and heard him speaking in Russian and saw footsteps under the door, imagery from the beginning of the movie when his mother held a party for her Communist friends. When the agent finally gets in, he finds that Bobby has torn apart the room trying to find a bug as he thinks the Russians are spying on him. This scene shows just how far removed from reality he was. Even his opponent is mad as he thinks there is a bug in his chair.At the end of the movie they tell a little about the rest of Fischer's life. He did get a arrested for vagrancy (My friend who was watching with me looked that up and it means being homeless. Kind of a stupid crime.) and eventually died in Iceland.I think that Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance in this film and it just might be my favorite of 2015 (at least until the new Star Wars comes out!).",Pawn Sacrifice
