0,MartinHafer,"Proper parenting, John Wayne style!",7,5 July 2009,"This John Wayne western is set around the beginning of the Twentieth century. According to the film, the days of the wild West and rustling were now thought to be over, though they soon would learn that this is not necessarily the case. This is because a group of bandits attack the ranch that Wayne's ex-wife (Maureen O'Hara--in a very familiar role) runs. Many are killed and the grandson is kidnapped for ransom. So, she sends out word for Wayne to come home. Once there, they organize a plan and a posse and head into Mexico to get the boy back--but the folks organizing it seem to ignore Wayne and his advice, so you can easily predict what will happen next! After many of them are killed in the process, Wayne takes on the job with the assistance of two of his grown sons.Now before I go on, let's talk about John Wayne's parenting style in this film. Needless to say, it's unconventional! Here are a few of his tidbits of his vast parenting knowledge: 1. If you have been absent from your sons' lives for most of their lives, when you are reunited, don't accept any anger or bitterness from your sons. If they don't immediately respect you and do what you say, slug 'em.2. If they are nearly killed, slug 'em--after all, you love them and don't want anything bad to happen to them.3. Don't allow for the fact that your sons have opinions or accomplishments--they will always be your inferiors.4. If your sons have any questions as to why their mom and dad split up, slug 'em. If they ask about why you ""ran out"" on Ma, ignore them and walk off--a real man NEVER has to be answerable to his children.5. If a son is hesitant about killing someone, belittle him. After all, killing other fellas is a sign of masculinity.6. Have a trusted sidekick who tells the kids ""Keep your mouths shut and listen to him (Wayne)"".7. To show your sons that fighting and manliness is important, take them to a bar and then pick a fight with the meanest guy there. You don't need to win, but a good show of manhood is important. After all, how else will your boys learn?! 8. Hug 'em? Nah...slug 'em! 9. After you and your sons kill off the bad guys in a big blood bath, understand it's a bonding experience. Time to let old wounds disappear. It's Miller time! Although I did come up with a dandy list of lessons I learned from the film (most of them terrible), I must say that the film was well done and satisfying--especially in a brainless sort of way. This is NOT meant as criticism--sometimes a brainless action/adventure film is just what the doctor ordered! By the way, though I am giving the movie a positive rating, I must point out that one scene in particular irritated me (other than all the father-son punching, of course). Glenn Corbet was barely noticed in the film. However, late in the movie, he has a gun drawn on Patrick Wayne. What happens next is the dumbest and most pointless scene from a Western I've seen in ages. Watch this scene and see what I mean.By the way, like many of Wayne's films of the 60s and 70s, the casting is quite odd. First, there is Bobby Vinton playing a son of John Wayne--polka-singing and permed Vinton! Second, Bruce Cabot (a common Wayne supporting actor) plays an American-Indian!",Big Jake
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Could have been more, but watchable",5,6 February 2011,"This is not John Wayne's best film or his worst either, for me it leans towards the watchable but disappointing category. It is definitely watchable, especially for the handsome photography and scenery. Also the first five minutes was inspired I think, and the score was more than adequate. While past his prime, John Wayne is good here, I liked how Maureen O'Hara was so elegant and Richard Boone is very entertaining.Sadly, Big Jake is also quite lazily directed, and the plot is disappointingly meagre. The script is an uneven mix, one minute it flows well, the other it feels stilted, while the ending could have been better rounded off. Out of the cast, I liked Wayne, I liked Boone, I liked O'Hara, but I thought Chris Mitchum and Patrick Wayne were pretty awful.All in all, it is a watchable effort but doesn't quite work. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Big Jake
2,bkoganbing,"""That'll Be the Day""",8,18 January 2006,"Though Big Jake doesn't go down with the greatest of John Wayne's films I put it in the class of The Comancheros which I also found entertaining. This film is the right mixture of chemistry and action. No doubt helped by the fact that John Wayne was surrounded with family literally.John Wayne is the estranged patriarch of a family who owns a big cattle spread just as he did in McLintock. A gang of kidnappers came on the place while most everyone was on roundup and killed several people and kidnapped Wayne's grandson. Grandmother Maureen O'Hara sends for her estranged husband to deal with the kidnappers as he sees fit. Being this is a John Wayne movie, you already know how that is.Son Michael Wayne is the producer and sons Patrick and Ethan play Wayne's son and grandson. This is a bit of a change for Patrick Wayne. From back in the days of The Searchers, Pat Wayne always played callow youths in his father's and in other films. Here he's a grown man and quite bitter at his father. The conflict between them crackles on the screen. Christopher Mitchum, the son of another Hollywood icon, plays another Wayne offspring as does Bobby Vinton.The action flows pretty good here and the tension does not let up for a moment. There are some good comic moments, but they are well integrated into the plot of the story.Of the Duke's films post his Oscar from True Grit, Big Jake is one of his best and a personal favorite of mine.",Big Jake
3,Leofwine_draca,Solid western for an ageing hero,6,26 July 2017,"BIG JAKE is another solid western for the dependable John Wayne, here playing up his age as an old-time gunslinger drawn back into action once more when his own son is kidnapped. The film charts the progression of the Old West with the advent of new technology; I never thought I'd be watching motorbike stunts in a John Wayne movie! I loved Wayne's character in this one, as his one-liners are tougher than ever and he has lots of little neat touches, like needing his glasses to read anything and sticking to short-range weapons due to his failing sight. The rest of the story is familiar but the cast is well populated by familiar faces and the action hits home.",Big Jake
4,SnoopyStyle,needs to be darker and bloodier,6,25 December 2014,"It's 1909. A gang of outlaws from various background led by John Fain (Richard Boone) attack the McCandles ranch. They kidnap little Jacob McCandles for ransom. Grandmother Martha (Maureen O'Hara) is offered help from the Army and the Texas Rangers but she decides to call on her estrange husband Big Jake (John Wayne). He is a legendary gunfighter and ""an extremely harsh and unpleasant kind of man to see it through."" Martha gives him a million dollar for the ransom. His son James doesn't like him not having seen him for almost ten years. His other son Michael rides up on a motorcycle with a visual sighting of Jacob. While everybody takes off to hunt down the bandits, Big Jake goes by himself with the money on horseback. An aging Apache friend Sam Sharpnose joins him. The mechanized group is ambushed and their cars are all out of commission. Big Jake finds the group stranded. Michael angrily joins Jake and they find James with his crashed motorcycle.This should be much darker and bloodier. It takes too many detours into comedy which never actually pays off. It's like the movie forgets about the kidnapped boy. This is a lower grade western which seems to be from another era. The formula is getting as old as John Wayne. When the action and the story twist comes, it's not half bad. It just needs to stay out of the comedy. There's nothing funny about the story.",Big Jake
5,mark.waltz,"Grandpa, Get Your Gun!",6,14 November 2012,"When the grandson of beautiful Maureen O'Hara and her estranged husband John Wayne is kidnapped, Wayne re-appears after being believed by many people other than his wife to be dead. He joins his sons (Bobby Vinton, Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum) to find the nasty gang (lead by Richard Boone) who are holding him hostage out of vengeance. Wayne and sons fight the villains tooth and nail, and Wayne gets to show a sentimental side for both the wife he still loves and the grandson he never knew.The focus may be on the family, but the style is violence. Boone and his men are evil renegades, and Wayne and sons represent old-fashioned goodness. The conflict is there, the heroes all rugged and handsome, and the wasted O'Hara undeniably one of the most beautiful veteran actresses still working in the 1970's. You can't take your eyes off her for her fleeting time on screen, and wish she was there more. The final battle between the two groups goes on far too long, and the situation with Wayne and O'Hara is never resolved, leading the viewer to make their own conclusions. In spite of that, it is hard not to like the film, even if this is one of Wayne's bloodier westerns.",Big Jake
6,kosmasp,John Wayne and sons,9,25 January 2021,"Well the character is Big Jake, so it'd be Big Jake and sons. But the charisma of the man who is loved by many (rumors about certain things and views of his aside, which I can't confirm and have been denied by his relatives) is really apparent here. And one of his sons ... is his son. In real life that is - I didn't check or search for it, but with the last name Wayne, I don't think one has to wonder too much or speculate on that, to know it's true.John Wayne also seems to have had his contribution on the script. Uncredited but it shows in the movie. He really is beyond giving ... well let's just say there is a lot of smirk, there is a lot of winking when it comes to his persona or what the public saw him as. Really well acted movie, tension filled (if maybe a little bit too long). If you like Western movies that have some wit and humor, you can not go wrong with this one. Blood effects are aged and some shooting ... poses may seem ridiculous nowadays, but those are minor flaws, that cannot take anything away from the movie overall. You know there is a reason why people love John Wayne and his movies ... and this only solidifies that.",Big Jake
7,classicsoncall,"""Now boys, you know that ain't no way to treat your old Daddy.""",7,10 January 2016,"As I sit here thinking about the movie, the question that keeps popping up is 'who was Little Jake's father?'. At the shootout to end the story, he calls James (Patrick Wayne) 'Uncle Jim', and Michael (Christopher Mitchum) was obviously too young. Process of elimination would make the wounded McCandles brother Jeff (Bobby Vinton) his Dad, but that was never firmly established, and I don't recall Jeff ever reacting to the kidnapping like Jake was his own son. So what gives? If anyone can answer, we can start in on who was Little Jake's mother.I liked the way the story mixed in elements of humor to move the story forward. The buckshot butt scene was comical, and hearing John Wayne sing in Spanish in the shower was a bit offbeat for the film star. I don't think I've ever seen Wayne sing in a picture, so that was an interesting touch. Dog's (Dog?) role was a welcome addition to the story too, but it was a little distracting whenever his coloration seemed to change from time to time. Still, a dog that loyal comes highly recommended.I'm on record in some of my other reviews for preferring the old Paladin himself, Richard Boone as a Western villain. He seems more colorful as an outlaw and certainly has the craggy features to pull off the bad guy role. His 'thought you were dead' line to Big Jake at the finale was priceless; the film needed that closure to fulfill one of Big Jake's promises earlier in the story.All in all a decent John Wayne Western, establishing his character right up there with the likes of J.D. Cahill and Rooster Cogburn. Now if we can get the Little Jake mystery cleared up we'd be all set.",Big Jake
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Big Jake Holds His Own, Thank You",8,1 November 2005,"Mark this down as a very entertaining western with more realistic gunfight scenes than most films, meaning the good guys get shot as well as the villains. John Wayne's ""The Searchers,"" a very similar movie story-wise, gets a lot better press than this film but ""Big Jake"" is just as good, if not better. To be fair, while the gunfights in here were well done, the fistfights were an insult. Whenever someone got slugged, such as Wayne belting his kids, it had no effect on them, except just to knock them down for a second or two. In real life, folks, chances are you will knocked unconscious if you are hit in the face, especially by a powerful man like Wayne. This has been a ludicrous fact-of-life, however, in all films for 100 years, not just here.Other than that, the film is a straight hard-nosed one with Wayne and adversary Richard Boone both fascinating. The dialog between the two was especially fun to hear. Too bad there wasn't more of it. Boone did not have enough lines in this film. Wayne's real-life sons in this film didn't impress me with their acting but they weren't horrible either.Bruce Cabot was a hoot as an old Indian friend of Wayne's. As with most westerns, there is some nice scenery so if you have the opportunity, watch this on widescreen DVD. It was nice-looking movie.",Big Jake
9,rmax304823,Big Duke,5,24 August 2009,"Big John Wayne had a normal screen persona by this time and he rarely tried for much else. He was the relaxed, authoritative, retrograde man of action -- slow to wrath but volcanic once aroused. It wasn't that he couldn't play any other roles. He was quite different in films like ""Red River,"" ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" and ""True Grit."" In earlier works like ""The Wake of the Red Witch,"" he could seem positively mean. He may have been incapable of playing, say, a coward or a child molester, but he could stretch when he wanted to.He just didn't want to. He was an icon of vernacular culture and felt that he would be providing the public with a poor role model if he played a weakling. (His lung cancer was at first concealed from the public.) And, secondly, he believed his audiences wanted to see his usual self on the screen, as we see it here in ""Big Jake."" So both moral and commercial considerations were involved. What's visible here is Duke's default setting. Richard Boone and his gang kidnap Wayne's grandson, Ethan Wayne, and Duke and a handful of companeros track them down to deliver the ransom and precipitate a final shootout. The shootout is the most exciting part of the movie, resembling that in ""The Sand Pebbles,"" though not nearly as well done.It's 1909. Pavlova is famous. Caruso is singing at the Met. The Texas Rangers try to follow the kidnappers in motor cars and some carry new-fangled gas-operated semi-automatic repeating pistols. But Duke will have none of that. He rides a mule and trails two others, one carrying a million dollars in ransom. I mean, Wayne has a dog named ""Dog,"" so what do you want? ""Old Yeller""? ""Blue""? You will never find THIS Duke with a dog named anything like ""Agamemnon"" or ""Siwash."" The script has some comic moment and some dramatic, but they aren't too well blended. By the climax, we don't know what to expect -- farce or tragedy. Actually, as it turns out, it's neither. The Indian and ""Dog"" are lost, but the bad guys are all gone and the principals survive. The last line is, ""Let's go home."" Award for Best Performance in a Routine Western goes to -- envelope please -- thank you -- Richard BOONE as the puffy-faced, squint-eyed villain and the single most expressive features on the screen! First Runner Up: An almost unrecognizably grizzled Harry Carey, Jr. Worst Performance -- no need for an envelope -- Patrick Wayne as Duke's son, which he was in real life. Not a line is believable. First Runner Up: Chris Mitchum. Come to think of it, ""Dog"" isn't bad either. Not for a dog, anyway. When he's wounded, he gives an extremely good impression of crawling along painfully on his belly -- extremely good for a dog, anyway. Maureen O'Hara has a few minutes of screen time at the beginning and she's good, as always, but make up has given her the beehive hair do that all the women in this movie wear, and it's unbecoming. We need those Titian curls cascading down her cheeks.",Big Jake

It's a sympathetic western , with a beautiful cinematography , glamorous scenery and great soundtrack . Besides , it contains good feeling as friendship , faithfulness , companionship , and enjoyable father-sons relationship . Furthermore , an anti-racism subtext was written into the script in response to ongoing criticism of John Wayne . The screenplay is plain and simple, with a conventional plot , but ultimately gets overcome . Gorgeous outdoors with decent art production by Carl Anderson . The picture bears a certain resemblance to ¨Chaill US Marshal¨ (1973) by Andrew V. McLagen replacing the baddie George Kennedy for Richard Boone . Enjoyable acting by always great John Wayne , owing to the hit of this movie , John Wayne was number one at the U.S. box-office for the last time, a bit later on , he sicked by cancer .

Colorful and spectacular cinematography in Panavision by William H. Clothier . Rightly produced by Batjac Production , a company presided by John Wayne and his son Michael A. Wayne . This well-paced film was compellingly directed by George Sherman and uncredited John Wayne himself . Sherman does the human touch including lots of nice moments , it is a very good picture that could become another western worthy of any anthology . Sherman made reliable low-budget fares for Columbia between 1945-48, then moved on to do the same at Universal for another eight years . Sherman specialized almost exclusively in ""B"" westerns there , including the ""Three Musketeers"" series, which featured a young John Wayne. George directed lots of Westerns as ¨The Last of the Fast Guns¨ , ¨The Lone Hand¨, ¨Santa Fe stampede¨ , ¨Red skin¨ , ¨Chief Crazy Horse¨ ¨Calamity Jane¨, ¨Relentless¨ , ¨Comanche Territory¨ , ¨Dawn at Socorro¨, ¨Border River¨ and many others . He also made occasional forays into action and horror themes, often achieving a sense of style over substance . The only ""A""-grade films to his credit were two westerns starring John Wayne: ¨Comancheros¨ (1961) (as producer) and ¨The big Jack¨ (1971) . His last films were realized in Spain as ""Find That Girl"" , ¨The new Cinderella¨ and ¨Joaquin Murrieta¨. Rating : 7.5/10. Well worth watching.",Big Jake
11,wes-connors,My Three Sons,5,17 August 2007,"At this point in his career, John Wayne shows he can still make a John Wayne movie. He plays ""Big Jake"", a rancher estranged from his family. When grandson ""Little Jake"" is kidnapped, the elder Jake leads takes a crew (including sons) out to rescue the kid. The sons he takes are the uncles, by the way, of the boy. Bobby Vinton play's the kid's father, but he's left behind.There is some ""generation gap"" stuff going on between Mr. Wayne and his sons (one of whom is Robert Mitchum's son, actually). Maureen O'Hara appears briefly. It's very typical and predictable. Wayne has a hair raising shower scene, but his hair stays on (don't worry). The ending is exciting - predictably successful, with a touch of sadness.More bloody than other Waynes, with some questionable casting decisions. ***** Big Jake (1971) George Sherman ~ John Wayne, Richard Boone, Patrick Wayne",Big Jake
12,michaelRokeefe,One of John Wayne's best.,7,27 December 2012,"Aging Texas cattleman Jake McCandles(John Wayne)is looked upon by some of his peers as being too old to cut the mustard; but this man's man musters into action when ruthless cutthroats led by John Fain(Richard Boone) kidnap his grandson. Big Jake returns to join his estranged family in the search of the youngster called Little Jake. Once again The Duke is paired with the beautiful Maureen O'Hara as his wife; real life son Patrick plays sharpshooting son James. Robert Mitchum's son Christopher plays Big Jake's son Michael. Boone is the perfect villain. And his minions are faithful, but dumb enough to die for him. Plenty of gun play and violence to befit a Wayne western. Beautiful, but rugged scenery filmed entirely in Mexico. Other players include: Glenn Corbett, John Doucette, Jim Davis, Harry Carey, Jr., Bruce Cabot and Wayne's own son Ethan plays Little Jake. Maybe not a big money maker as some, but one of The Duke's most popular movies. I personally consider it one of his best.",Big Jake
13,searchanddestroy-1,Amazingly fun.,8,4 June 2020,"One more western played with the Duke during the late sixties and early seventies in the pure fifties tradition, thousand miles away from the other features of this era: gloomy, bleak, brutal, depressing tales made by the likes of Sam Peckinpah, Monte Hellman and many other directors, even old timers. This western directed by the veteran George Sherman - his last film - could have been made by Burt Kennedy or Andy Mc Laglen. Remember WAR WAGON, TRAIN ROBBERS, GREAT MC LINTOCK, UNDEFEATED, CAHILL US MARSHALL. I was not deceived by the humor all long this feature, I liked the family comedy links between Wayne and his sons. I don't think a violent and bloody atmosphere would have been right in this kind of film; unless it is a totally other movie. And I prefer dark and violent features than comedies, but here it's different. Speaking of Andrew Mc Laglen, without the Duke, he gave us in 1976 a very dark western, starring Chuck Heston and Jim Coburn: THE LAST HARD MEN. In BIG JAKE, I particularly crave for the opening sequence, presenting the most impressive batch of bad guys I have ever seen in a film. And with an off voice describing every of those ""lovely"" characters. This way of story telling reminded me Roger Corman in ST VALENTINE 'S DAY MASSACRE;",Big Jake
14,hitchcockthelegend,You follow him and I'll hunt you down and kill yah.,7,27 April 2011,"Big Jake is directed by George Sherman and written by Harry and Rita Fink. It stars John Wayne, Richard Boone, Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum and Maureen O'Hara. Elmer Berstein scores the music and William H. Clothier is the cinematographer. It's shot in Panavision and Technicolor with the principal location for the shoot being Durango in Mexico. Plot finds Duke Wayne as tough old rancher/gunfighter Jake McCandles, who is estranged from his family and spends his days roaming the west with his trusty dog. However, when the McCandles family ranch is raided by a gang of outlaws led by John Fain (Boone), and Jake's grandson Little Jake is kidnapped for ransom, Big Jake gets the call from his separated wife Martha (O'Hara) to go find the boy. Which he sets off to do, with two of his sons in tow.There were many critics who felt John Wayne should have stopped making movies before the 1970's arrived. Which is a bit ignorant considering he would bow out with the heartfelt and poignant The Shootist in 1976. It's undeniable that of the ten 1970's film's he made before his death, half of them are disposable at best, Big Jake isn't one of them. Yes, the formula is hardly new, only here the blood quota is considerably higher than previous Duke Wayne outings, and yes, tonally the film is a bit too up and down for its own good. But it's a film that finds old hands Wayne and Boone turning in good shows and the action and thematic camaraderie on show more than compensates for the looming cloud of same old same old.Of worth, too, is the time setting of the story, coming as it does towards the back end of the Old West, we get to see many examples of the Wild West being tamed. Be it the railroad, or motor driven vehicle's, our protagonist and antagonist are old school characters framed by a changing West. This is where it pays to have Wayne and Boone in the main roles, turning it in in an old school, knowing, style. The names Clothier and Bernstein are synonymous with the Western genre, and they don't disappoint here, both the photography and score treat the eyes and the ears. And although not in it for very long, O'Hara adds a touch of class in what was the last of the five times she appeared on film with her friend Duke Wayne. In amongst the violence there's also plenty of fun, some intended courtesy of banter between Duke and his estranged sons, some not intended; such as watching the dog out act the siblings of Duke and Robert Mitchum! But all told, if you don't expect The Searchers or Hondo et all, then this holds up as a good way to spend an afternoon. 7/10Footnote: I wonder if John Carpenter watched and enjoyed this film so much he cribbed a reoccurring joke from it for Escape from New York? Big Jake keeps coming up against people who say that they thought he was dead, same thing happens to Snake Plissken in Carpenter's picture. A homage I'm sure.",Big Jake
15,CinemaSerf,Interesting turn-of the-century western.,7,18 December 2019,"This is probably the most violent of Wayne's westerns depicting a tale of an estranged husband who returns home after his grandson is taken hostage by a ruthless gang of kidnappers. This well paced thoughtful drama takes us on the journey as he - with his two sons and an almost unrecognisable Bruce Cabot set off to rescue the boy. Richard Boone is outstanding as the evil leader of the kidnappers; he really does exude a sense of threat. The production does let this down a bit, though - the music is intrusive and the look and feel makes me wonder if it was shot on tape, rather than film and the colours and light don't look so hot. It's still a good, exciting watch with some touches of humour and a very much on-form star.",Big Jake
16,utgard14,"""You're short on ears and long on mouth.""",7,27 April 2014,"Excellent western from Duke's later years. In the early 1900s, Jacob McCandles (John Wayne) sets out to rescue his grandson from kidnappers led by John Fain (Richard Boone). On the journey he gets to know his two grown sons (Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum) he hasn't seen in nearly a decade. This one's lots of fun. Richard Boone makes for a great villain. One of the few villains Duke ever had in his films that seemed close to a match for him. Maureen O'Hara plays Duke's wife in their last movie together. Duke's longtime friend and frequent costar Bruce Cabot is very likable as Sam the Indian. This is one of those ""death of the West/old vs new"" stories that were all over the place in the '60s and '70s. Not surprisingly, Wayne made some of the best of those. It's a great western with some lighter moments, lots of action, and memorable tough guy lines.",Big Jake
17,zardoz-13,Violent But Above-Average Wayne Western,7,8 July 2011,"Several things about director George Sherman's last western shoot'em-up ""Big Jake"" are significant. First, this represented the last time John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara co-starred in a film. Earlier, Wayne and O'Hara made ""Rio Grande"" (1950), ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), ""The Wings of Eagles"" (1957), and ""McLintock!"" (1963). O'Hara has two scenes in ""Big Jake,"" but she appears in only one with the Duke. Second, this was the tenth and last time Wayne and Sherman worked together. Sherman had called the shots on several strictly average ""Three Mesquiteers"" B-movie westerns with Wayne for Republic Studios back in the late 1930s. Reportedly, Wayne stepped in to helm some scenes when the ailing Sherman could not. Third, this oater also re-teamed Wayne with a poncho-clad Richard Boone as an unsavory main villain. Previously, they appeared together in ""The Alamo"" (1960) and ultimately confronted each other again in a bar room shoot-out in Wayne's final western ""The Shootist"" (1976). ""Dirty Harry"" scenarists Harry Julian Fink and Rita M. Fink penned the entertaining but formulaic screenplay about the kidnapping of a wealthy but aging cattleman's grandson. Indeed, the villains are a dastardly bunch, and they give our the heroes a difficult time. As ""Big Jake,"" John Wayne spends most of his time riding around Mexico trying to keep himself and his two inexperienced sons alive. Although this is largely a traditional Wayne western, ""Big Jake"" pits the weapons and transportation of an old-fashioned western (horses, revolvers, and shotguns) against the new-fangled western where people ride in cars or on motorcycles and wield automatic weapons. Predictably, 'Big' Jake wins the day with his old-fashioned approach. Sherman does a solid job of establishing the setting of this sagebrusher and the time period with a lengthy prologue. John Fain (Richard Boone) leads a gang of murderous cutthroats who raid the McCandles ranch. This opening shoot-out qualifies as the bloodiest gunfight in a Wayne western. When bullets hit bodies, huge smears of red paint appear. Remember, the Duke objected to those exploding blood squibs in Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" and described them as ""obscene."" Since most of the ranch hands are away on a cattle round-up, Fain and his trigger-happy gunmen have little trouble when they start blasting away after some friendly conversation with the foreman. Without a qualm, they wound and/or kill ten men, women and children. They wound McCandles' eldest son Jeff (Bobby Vinton of ""Surf Party"") and kidnap his eight-year old grandson (Ethan Wayne) and then post a ransom of $1 million. 'Big' Jake McCandles' wife, Martha (Maureen O'Hara of ""The Quiet Man""), summons her husband through some messengers. They meet at a railway station, and she hands him the ransom note. Jake and Martha have been estranged for almost a decade, but they both love little Jake, and 'Big Jake' vows to bring him back. Waiting for their father at the depot are sons James McCandles (real-life son Patrick Wayne of ""The Alamo"") and Michael (Christopher Mitchum of ""Rio Lobo"") and their reception is soured by James' sarcasm toward his father. James calls him ""Daddy"" in a snide voice, and Jake pulls him off his horse and hurls him into a mud puddle. Jake informs James in no uncertain terms: ""You can call Dad, you can call me Father, you can call me Jacob and you can call me Jake. You can call me a dirty old son-of-a-bitch, but if you EVER call me Daddy again, I'll finish this fight."" Jake takes custody of a huge red strongbox with a million dollars in it and rides off with his old friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot of ""King Kong"") while James and Michael follow Buck and the Texas Rangers.A conventional and often predictable oater, ""Big Jake"" springs no real surprises. The revelation about an hour into the action that our heroes have been guarding a strong box that contains nothing but paper clippings comes as no surprise. No sooner have Buck and the Texas Rangers entered Mexico than Fain's men ambush them, kill three of them, and riddle their cars with gunfire. Meanwhile, it appears that Michael has been shot because he crashes his motorcycle and lays sprawled in the dust. Jake is more surprised than we are when his son gets back up. Naturally, this calls for Wayne to punch Michael's lights out. Jake leaves the Texas Rangers to fend for themselves while he rides off to the rendezvous with Fain. At about a hour into the plot, Jake and Fain meet in Jake's camp. Fain instructs them to go to the nearby Mexican town of Escondero and await their orders. Later that evening, gunmen try to storm room number eight where our heroes are lying in wait for them. Jake, James, and Sam leave Michael alone in the room. Jake stages a distraction so Sam can slip back into the room, while James guns down to bullies in the saloon with his automatic pistol. Not long afterward, a suspicious Pop Dawson fetches Jake and company and they ride out to meet Fain and ransom the youngster. It is a classic stand-off again when Fain and Jake confront each other with Little Jake in plain sight. Michael has ascended to the top of water tower and uses his high-powered rifle to knock out a sniper in an adjacent belfry. What started as an interesting scene degenerates into a free-for-all shoot-out without a shred of suspense. The brute with a machete manages to slash poor old Sam to death and later kills the dog. Jake throws a lantern at Fain and lights him up before he perforates him with a bullet. No sooner has Little Jake been reunited with his family than the film freeze-frames them and comes to an end.""Big Jake"" qualifies as an above-average Wayne effort with more blood than usual, and the Duke makes a memorable entrance that overshadows everything that follows.",Big Jake

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay western but certainly not one of John Wayne's finest films ever produced as it was a bit too predictable and the characters seemed rather shallow as well.

20,Wuchakk,"One of the lesser latter-day Wayne Westerns, but still amusing",5,8 January 2015,"Released in 1971, ""Big Jake"" is a Western starring John Wayne in the titular role. His grandson is kidnapped by a ruthless band of cutthroats, led by Richard Boone, and taken to Mexico where they await the ransom money. Jake teams up with his estranged sons, whom he hasn't seen for ten years (Patrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum), to rescue the kid (Ethan Wayne). The magnificent Maureen O'Hara plays Jakes long-lost wife, but her role is limited to a glorified cameo in the opening reel.Some of The Duke's best Westerns were in the last decade of his career, like ""True Grit"" (1969), ""Chisum"" (1970),""The Cowboys"" (1972), ""The Train Robbers"" (1973), ""Rooster Cogburn"" (1975), ""The Shootist"" (1976), and even oaters like ""The War Wagon"" (1967) and ""El Dorado"" (1967), but ""Big Jake"" isn't one of 'em. It's definitely likable, like most of Wayne's Westerns, and it has its highlights, like the almost shocking opening raid (marred by incredibly fake-looking blood). It's also unique in that it takes place in 1909 and there are quite a few sequences with old automobiles and a motorcycle, which isn't typical of Westerns. Unfortunately the mid-section fails to thoroughly captivate, but it is entertaining having John and the underrated Patrick working together; and Mitchum is charismatic as well.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in the Durango, Mexico area.GRADE: C+",Big Jake
21,SimonJack,A Western family affair in the story and the cast,7,14 January 2018,"John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara appeared together in five films over 20 years. In most of those, they co-starred as the leads. But in this final pairing of 1971, O'Hara's part is little more than a cameo. That's because it's all guys and guts after their reuniting after many years of separation, and the guys ride off into danger. The Duke plays ""Big Jake"" McCandles, and two estranged sons join him in his quest to save his grandson. Little Jake, whom he has never seen, was kidnapped and is being held for ransom. Apparently, Martha (O'Hara) is a rich woman and has agreed to pay the $1 million ransom. But, only Jake can be trusted to make the swap. Of course, the local sheriff and a posse with new-fangled horseless carriages think they can get to the kidnappers faster. After they are ambushed and taken out of action, Jake's sons see the wisdom of his ways and join in his quest. Surprises are in store for the kidnappers and for others as well. Wayne plays an older man - or his age, in this film (64), and so he's slowed down. Wisdom in this case encompasses taking one's time and not rushing headlong into things or places. I can identify with that. Otherwise, it's a solid Western with plenty of action. It's a good tale in the John Wayne tradition of Westerns. Among the very good supporting cast is Richard Boone as John Fair, the ""brains"" of the kidnappers. The Duke's son, Patrick Wayne plays his son, James, in the film. Others are Bruce Cabot, Harry Carey Jr., and Christopher Mitchum, son of actor Robert Mitchum. The film's cast is as much a family affair as is the story and their parts in it.",Big Jake
22,whpratt1,The Polish Prince was in this Film,7,27 May 2007,"This was a John Wayne film I greatly enjoy and was surprised at the wonderful old automobiles from the 1900's driving up and down every trail and even motorcycles. John Wayne played the role as Jacob McCandles who was looked up to as a man you did not mess with and respected. Maureen O'Hare, (Martha McCandles) seeks the help of her husband after years of being separated when their grandchild is kidnapped for a ransom for One Million Dollars. The gang of crooks is headed by Richard Boone, (John Fain) who will kill women and children in cold blood and think nothing of it. Patrick Waynes son has a role in this film along with the Polish Prince of Music and Song, Bobby Vinton.

24,weezeralfalfa,"Brutal cattleman and gunslinger rediscovers his estranged sons and wife, and helps wipe out a murdering bandit gang",6,27 April 2014,"John Wayne, now in his 60s, plays a crude version of Ben Cartwright(TV's Bonanza), in rediscovering his abandoned Texas cattle ranching family, after a 10year absence, and helps rescue his grandson from a very violent bandit gang. The latter, instead of merely rustling cattle, kill most of his wife's firearm-incompetent hands(her 2 sons conveniently escaping serious harm), and kidnap his grandson for a whopping(especially in those days) $1 million ransom. Seems his wife Martha(Maureen O'Hara) had been a very savvy ranch manager in his absence, and claims that losing $1 million will not set her back too much(hardly believable unless she is pumping lots of oil too). She sends for Jake to deliver the chest supposedly containing the greenbacks, trusting no one else to do the job right. Of course, there will be an attempt to do in the bandits instead, without getting their grandson killed. Martha OKs a plan to ambush the bandits, using Texas Rangers touring cars to get there fast. Jake doesn't like it. It turns into a disaster(as Jake presumably predicted), as the would be bushwhackers get wacked on the way, instead. The message is that modern mechanical technology is not always appropriate in this frontier environment... Be prepared to see a lot of red dye on shirts and pants. A lot of people get shot, often multiple times, sometimes dying, sometimes only wounded. In some respects, it reminds us of ""McLintock"", also produced by Wayne's company: Batjac, 8 years previously. However, this time it's Wayne's character, rather than Maureen's character, who returns to their ranch home after a long estrangement. Wayne's interactions with his sons and grandson, rather than with his wife and daughter(as in ""McLintock'), is at the heart of the story. Although she dominates much of the first portion of the film, Maureen disappears after the men leave to try to recover the grandson. In contrast to ""McLintock"", there is a spirit of temporary cooperation, rather than emphasizing the personality clashes between Wayne's and Maureen's characters. However, unlike in ""McLintock"", there is no hint of an eventual romantic reconciliation. Also, the abundant gunplay, killings and woundings, is in marked contrast to ""McLintock"". Two of Wayne's actual sons play one of his sons or grandson, while one of Robert Mitchum's sons plays Jake's other son(the one who arrives on a motorcycle). The following year, Wayne again starred as a father figure, albeit quite different, in another coming of age film ; ""The Cowboys"". I prefer that film, despite its implausibility. Richard Boone plays his usual villainous role in the present film. Bruce Dern was much more interesting as the demented leader of the baddies in ""The Cowboys"" . ""McClintock"" and ""The Cowboys"" are much better and more original films than the present one.Wayne plays one of his most blustering and violent characters, ordering people around he doesn't know, slapping and punching his sons or others on occasion to show who's boss, and intimidating most just by his past reputation. Not the most appealing guy to have around, but he usually gets the job done. Some John Ford-type humor is included here and there. However, there is no romantic aspect involving Jake or his sons. This was the last non-TV film directing job by veteran George Sherman, who was sometimes too sick to perform his function, resulting in Wayne sometimes being the functional director. Sherman specialized in directing mostly 'second feature' films. However, two of them; ""Against All Flags"" and ""Comanche Territory"" are among my favorite film roles for Maureen. As in the present film, she is in a normally male role as a powerful leader or manager.As some others have pointed out, the dialog often comes across as stilted, and the acting generally is mediocre. The 'good guys' seem incapable of harming the bandits 'til the final showdown, when they all of sudden find their targets or find other ways to kill all the baddies, thus saving the justice system considerable trouble.We first encounter Jake muttering to his dog and horse, spying on a curious sight in an open field, with a single tree in the center. A man is about to be hanged on that tree by 3 men. Jake rides in to disturb the proceedings. He learns that the victim's crime is being a sheepherder in cattle country. He uses his reputation as a feared gunslinger and an attack by 'dog' to bully the cattlemen into releasing the shepherd and his young son, provided their sheep are moved elsewhere. This episode presumably functions to give us the idea, which Jake later claims, that his predilection for violence usually is for a good purpose. 'Dog' apparently is the collie 'Lassie', who has been dyed blackish to provide a sinister wolf-like impression. Soon after, a Mexican rider meets Jake riding alone on the range, giving him a brief written message request from Martha that he is needed at home, with no explanation why. He nods OK. Next thing we know, he arrives at their ranch by train. Unlikely for a man who hasn't communicated with his family for 10 years! Meanwhile, the bandits have been waiting for their ransom money, apparently without lawmen on their tail for their many recent murders.",Big Jake

Mr J.Wayne despite the usually politically inspired sniping by intellectuals,remains perhaps the greatest of the mythic Hollywood stars. In ""Big Jake"" he visits one of his recurring themes,the absentee parent or father - figure/mentor who eventually comes good. When the grandson he never even knew he had gets kidnapped,Jake's long - suffering wife (the glowing Miss M.O'Hara) gets word to him and sets him off on an odyssey with his best (only?) friend Sam Sharpnose and a strange collie - type dog that exhibits chameleon - like qualities as it struts the stage in its brief moment of fame. Mr Sharpnose - a Native American - is played by the great Mr B.Cabot who once saved Mr Wayne's life in a Tijuana bar.A penchant for the ladies had led the Duke into harm's way and Cabot bravely interposed his body between him and his assailant,sustaining serious injury. And a penchant for the ladies has cost Jake McCandles his marriage,his children and his ranch. Generously,Mr Wayne allows Mr R.Boone as the head villain to match him in every scene they appear in together. Some old favourites from John Ford's repertory company give the film a firm foundation. Dismissed by most critics at the time as a typical John Wayne potboiler, ""Big Jake"" is,in fact a very enjoyable picture.Perhaps not so elegaic as the later ""The Shootist"" or as fashionable as its near - contemporary ""The Wild Bunch"",but visiting the same territory with absolutely no pretensions to significance or greatness,merely the wish to involve and entertain its audience.And that it surely does.",Big Jake
26,MBunge,A Wayne Western with a touch of Peckinpah,7,11 March 2011,"Big Jake is a traditional John Wayne Western with a strangely unacknowledged level of modern savagery. It's got all the adventure and comic relief you'd expect, but every so often the level and intensity of the violence exceeds anything you'd anticipate. Sometimes that contrast appears to be intentional. Sometimes it's just odd. What it does is give this film an edge that makes it stand out from the many other Wayne Westerns.Set in 1909 as 20th Century civilization has finally taken root on the East Coast, this story concerns the still largely untamed American Southwest along the border with Mexico. John Fain (Richard Boone) leads a crew of 8 other vicious killers on a raid of the McCandles ranch, massacring a number of people and kidnapping the grandson of ranch owner Martha McCandles (Maureen O'Hara). Confronted with a million dollar ransom demand for the boy's return, Martha summons her long absent husband Jacob (John Wayne) to deliver the money and get his grandson back. Joined by his faithful dog, his sons James and Michael (Patrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum) and his old Indian friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot), Big Jake McAndles heads out through the beautiful countryside to battle Fain's raiders, greedy cowboys and the bitter resentment of his son James.Amidst the shootouts, brawls, scenery, gags and other elements of the Wayne Western, an interesting theme is woven through Big Jake. This is a tale about how the folks who lived and prospered in the Wild West, both good and bad, weren't all that pleasant. Jacob McAndles is a hard man. His Indian friend is a hard man. His wife is a hard woman. Even his dog is a hard beast. These are people (and an animal) of unflinching will who will risk and inflict death without hesitation. Michael McAndles, whose nicer manners and love of the latest 1909 technology represents the new era, has trouble accepting his father's ruthless violence. Big Jake serves as both an ode to the uncompromising strength needed to tame the frontier, yet doesn't shy away from the rough and unappealing aspects of that strength.That bluntness explains some of the graphic violence in this movie. It's not quite at the level of Sam Peckinpah, but Big Jake is bloodier and more cold blooded than most other Westerns. Not all of the moments of barbarism fit that explanation. For example, two characters meet extremely brutal ends without them having any emotional impact on the other characters.The best parts of this movie are Wayne (unsurprisingly) and his interactions with Bruce Cabot and Richard Boone. Wayne and Cabot mine a lot of humor out of their age, while Wayne and Boone perfectly capture the idea of men who are so tough they don't feel any need to show off. Wayne's scenes with his younger co-stars don't come off as well, particularly when Big Jake has to deal with the obviously forced and exaggerated anger from James, though perhaps that generation gap was on purpose.Big Jake is about a legendary Wild West figure who's so legendary everybody knows him, but they all think he's already dead. But though the movie accepts that the time and place for someone like Big Jake may have been ending, it argues there's still a little more room for that sort of spirit.",Big Jake

30,drystyx,Fun for Duke lovers and haters alike,9,10 March 2007,"When this film was made, the Duke already had the reputation for either being someone you love or hate. So the writers created a movie which was just all ""Duke"", that could make you love him or hate him, but still laugh your heart out and relish a perfect movie. There are too many big stars in this movie to mention. It starts almost like a commentary, which works well, and adds to the comic flavor of this movie. It isn't a comedy, but it has a very light hearted attitude, so you don't have to roll your eyes at ridiculous scenes that modern movies would try to make you take seriously. Nine outlaws raid a ranch, kill several people, and kidnap a boy. They give Maureen O'Hara a ransom note and head for the border. Easy money, right? Excuse me, that is the duke's grandson, buddy! Enough said about that. So the Duke embarks with his old companion and his two healthy sons (a third is shot up too bad), and clever writing, acting, and directing make this a romp anyone could enjoy. A lot of great lines. Patrick Wayne:...I'm really moved....Daddy! John Wayne: Daddy? Patrick: Daddy! John Wayne: Well, son, since you haven't learned to respect your elders, it's time you learned to respect your betters! (Whack! Thud!) Every family had fun with that line, just as I'm sure the Waynes did. Hard action. And the duke is mean and evil, or is he really good?

31,slokes,A Very Weird Wayne,2,14 September 2015,"To get this out of the way up front: I love John Wayne. Seeing him in a film as bad as this isn't just disappointing, it feels wrong.Jacob McCandles (Wayne) is a famous gunslinger whose estranged wife Martha calls upon him to return to his old ranch after desperadoes kidnap the grandson Jake didn't know he had. To get the boy back, Martha is told she must have a million dollars brought to the kidnappers in Mexico. Jake takes on the task of the boy's recovery.The film opens with carnage at the McCandles ranch, not at all realistic but certainly meant that way. There are a lot of blood splotches and random killing, of women and children as well as men. The bad guys in this movie may be likened to the James Gang, but they operate more like the Manson Family. No doubt this was an effort to reach numb and jaded audiences circa 1971.This proves a serious miscalculation as the film goes on and tries to develop a lighter, comic touch around the Big Jake character. He's established as an ornery cuss who punches out one of his own sons for calling him ""Daddy,"" then punches him out again for cracking wise about his leaving Martha. (How these McCandleses eat solid food is a mystery.)Every once in a while, Jake's dander is riled when someone tells him: ""I thought you were dead.""""Next man says that to me I'm gonna shoot, so help me,"" Jake fumes.The tone issues are the worst of it for me, clumsily handled by credited director George Sherman with an uncredited assist from Wayne. But nearly as bad is the dodgy plot. Simply put, there is no way Big Jake could expect his plans for recovering the boy to work in a world anywhere other than Hollywood. He relies on two bad eyes, an Apache also with bad eyes, a dog, and two unproven boys to take on a gang of criminals who just wasted a bunch of ranchhands and three carloads of Arizona Rangers.Oddities abound. Bruce Cabot plays Jake's Apache friend with a lot of Man Tan on his face and an attempt at Tonto-speak he discards within a few minutes. Bobby Vinton plays one of Jake's sons with an anachronistic perm and gold necklace whose sole purpose is getting shot. Other sons are played by Patrick Wayne, Wayne's real-life son and a terrible actor, and Christopher Mitchum, even worse here with his shimmering blond Beatles haircut and his left-field Evel Knievel motorcycle stunts.The motorcycle is probably anachronistic, too, although the point is made right away that we are in 1909, where lawmen ride cars, not horses, and pistols can be fed ammunition automatically. Of course, the real time change behind ""Big Jake"" is the 1970s, and Wayne adjusting to a new decade and a different culture. In other 1970s films, Wayne's characters handle this with grace and self-aware humor. Here Big Jake grumbles a lot and punches people.There's a confrontation scene in a Mexican town between Big Jake's group and a secondary bandit gang that, while illogical and overly convenient in its execution, is almost exciting. The final battle is a mess, though. I won't get into spoilers, but when five men with pistols and rifles surround an injured old man and a boy behind a hayrick, you need more than a lot of cutaways and back-and-forth dialogue to explain how the latter can possibly survive, let alone prevail.Watching a great actor play down to his stereotype persona is frustrating. When he's as inanimate as Wayne so often is here, it's worse. ""Big Jake"" seems to operate under the notion that if it features Wayne, and serves up as many reminders as it does of better Wayne movies, it will be enough. It's not, and when combined with its ugly, disjointed tone and general strangeness, ""Big Jake"" makes for a singularly deflating experience.",Big Jake
32,dworldeater,Big thumbs up for Big Jake,8,16 January 2021,"Big Jake has John Wayne saddle up yet again (with his two sons) for this solid western. The Duke is Big Jake and is out to rescue his grandson Little Jake from a gang of kidnappers. John Wayne is in top form here as a rugged old cowboy at the end of the western era. He is tough, charismatic and heroic here with some great one liners and unique screen presence. Opposite Wayne is Richard Boone as the leader of the kidnappers and is equally impressive as the iconic main villain. The movie is quiet bloody and violent for a Duke picture. However, other than the 70's level of violence Big Jake is a pretty traditional styled John Wayne western. Big Jake has a lot of comedy for a movie this violent, but it somehow works and works well.

The rest is left to Wayne Senior and his faithful attack dog, to shoulder the weight of the uneventful build up. He delivers a convincing performance with his typically formidable persona for mythmaking and a reverence for tradition. A high dose of overgrauitous violence mirrors the influence of revisionist filmmakers, like Sam Peckinpah, in the early 1970s. Richard Boone is impressive as the quietly psychopathic villain leading a band of cut-throats. There is only passive support from Maureen O'Hara.",Big Jake
36,coltras35,Just don't call him daddy!!,10,24 July 2021,"Apart from the inclusion of cars and bikes and the gritty violence reminiscent of revisionist westerns released around the late '60's and early 1970's, Big Jake is a traditional western, the kind Wayne could make in his sleep. Ideally cast as a cantankerous tough guy, Wayne is on top form in this turn of the century western, which mixes comedy and adventure quite well, and he is ably supported by his usual entourage of actors such as Patrick Wayne, Chris Mitchum, and Bruce Cabot, though Boone is - apart from the Alamo - isn't a Wayne stock player, and, boy, is he one cold-blooded villain.The story - Following a vicious raid on the McCandles's ranch, the young grandson of the family is kidnapped and held ransom for a million dollars. It's time for the head of the family - Big Jake - to swing into action....Big Jake is a highly entertaining western that has some great action sequences such as the motorbike scene - it's the most violent Wayne western, and sometimes it can be too much, such as the villain attacking with a machete, but it stops short of gratuitous and the humour balances it out. I loved watching this when I was young, finding it a film with a lot of heart, which leaves you feel good, especially with that rousing climax where the Duke and his sons sort out the bad ones, though I wish the dog ( actually a collie and a relative to Lassie!) didn't bite the dust.Wayne responds to Boone with a similar line to what he had said earlier: ""And now you understand. Anything goes wrong, anything at all... your fault, my fault, nobody's fault... it won't matter - I'm gonna blow your head off. No matter what else happens, no matter who gets killed I'm gonna blow your head off."" Absolute classic line delivered with totally conviction.",Big Jake
37,MiketheWhistle,A really good Wayne family feature,10,30 June 2020,"There are a few acts of violence, but otherwise this is pretty tame. Wayne is as good as he ever was, and having his sons makes it a truly Wayne family feature that has real good acting, action, suspense, light comedy, and truly worth watching.",Big Jake
38,one9eighty,Don't call me daddy!,7,27 July 2017,"The McCandles ranch is attacked by a gang of bad guys led by John Fain. They kill people, they steal things, but worse, they kidnap little Jacob McCandles and hold him for a million dollar ransom. Only ""Big"" Jake McCandles, John Wayne, can save the day, despite being old and presumed long dead in the film. Big Jake leads a small group which includes his real life son, as well as the kidnappers bounty through the wild west to the meeting point. Learning about each other in the process and having the occasional punch up.The acting can be split into two in this film. First, the dialogue - it's strong and the narrative drives action throughout the film. Secondly the acting, it's bloody awful, the punches are so fake that you could walk an elephant through the space between fist and face. Not being a massive font of knowledge on John Wayne films this felt like what a typical John Wayne film would feel like; an older looking fellow who rides into town, he's got a smart and sarcastic mouth, he respects ladies, he stands up to the bad guys, he punches some people, shoots others, then he rides off into the sunset. This is that kind of a film. It's set in 1909 at a time when motorbikes and motorcars roamed the wild west as well as outlaws on horseback, this felt a little out of place for my expectations of a western film, but hey ho, they have to move with the times too I guess. Not the best western, not the best western (because that's a hotel in the UK), something to watch with your brain disengaged on a lazy Sunday. Enjoy!",Big Jake
39,SanteeFats,Great stuff,9,26 July 2013,"This is a great movie. Lots action, great plot and acting. Big Jake is believed dead by almost everyone he runs into. Believe me he isn't!!! John Wayne is Big Jake and he is one tough mother. Richard Boone gets the lead bad guy role and he is very good. Maureen O'Hara is his wife and a very demanding shrew, yet they are still married. When his son is kidnapped by Boone and his gang that come to the McCandels ranch and kill a bunch of people and take the youngest and very effeminately dressed youngest son she calls for Big Jake. He shows up and with his sons he goes after the bad guys. I like that one of his sons are actually played by his real son. The bath scene is good and violent. Several of the amateurish bad men in the town are just sooo out classed and they die. Big Jake finally runs the kidnappers down and things come to a head. When things finally get to crunch time the dog gets killed by the fat ass, one son shoots the sniper and Richard Boone gets killed. The young son is safe and returned to mama.",Big Jake
40,kenandraf,Macho grandpa!,9,21 June 2001,"Wayne really looked tired and frail in this movie but this man was so full of macho charisma he can still be imposing half dead!By this time in the 70's,Wayne had perfected his acting skills and he acually had his best performances at this late stage of his career.Some things bothered me about this movie like the hero(Wayne) beating up his kids although I understand this was his way of imposing his leadership of the pack under those circumstances.Another thing that bothered me was the way the relationship was between Wayne and his trusted loyal Indian sidekick.We all know Wayne's right wing policy regarding people of color and that is they are ok as long as they are subservient to him as this Indian was.At one point the example was shown very clearly when Wayne asked the Indian to leave the room ALONG WITH THE DOG when he needed to talk to his sons.Kinda makes one chucke a little bit becouse that is so John Wayne.What a guy.The cinematography and attention to detail was good.The direction was average and the performances were very good except for the two sons of Wayne.Those two young actors skills were very amateurish.The screenplay and script was also good.Overall this movie made classic status by the skin of it's teeth.Not recommended to be seen by pre teens though becouse of it's more tha usual graphic style compared to other Wayne movies which is a plus for this movie as well!The 70's Wayne was the best!",Big Jake
41,virek213,Just Don't Call Him Daddy!,7,10 June 2007,"Regardless about how one feels about his arch-conservative politics, there really isn't any secret as to why John Wayne personified what it meant to be a star in Hollywood for decades on end. And even though he seemed to settle into a routine of making films under his Batjac production banner in the last decade and a half of his life without the strong guiding hand of a John Ford, a Howard Hawks, or a Henry Hathaway, he still put out what everyone had come to expect of the man. Case in point, BIG JAKE.Written by the same writers who gave Eastwood DIRTY HARRY, BIG JAKE stars Wayne as Jake McCandles, a Texas rancher whom everyone thought was dead because no one had seen him in eighteen years (as always, rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated). But he is called back into action by his estranged wife (Maureen O'Hara) after a gang of ruthless outlaws, led by Richard Boone, shoot up his ranch, kill much of the hired help, and kidnap his grandson (Ethan Wayne). Wayne, not surprisingly, takes up the challenge. But he also has to keep his sons (Glenn Corbett; Chris Mitchum) in line when they call him Daddy (obviously, this gets a burr up the Duke's backside). They all must venture across the Rio Grande to Boone's hideout on the Mexican side, helped out by Wayne's trusty Indian aide (Bruce Cabot). And it all comes down to an eminently satisfying and traditional showdown between Wayne and Boone.BIG JAKE is very much in the style of Wayne's other Batjac westerns (CHISUM; THE UNDEFEATED; THE WAR WAGON; CAHILL, U.S. MARSHAL) in its being somewhat predictable, but that predictability is precisely what makes it a success; people want Wayne to win, and who can blame them? Fortunately, he gets a vicious enough antagonist in Boone, who had had a minor role in the Duke's own 1960 directorial opus THE ALAMO and who does sagebrush villainy as well as anyone else. George Sherman, who had directed Wayne in several B-westerns prior to the Duke's ascension to stardom via Ford's STAGECOACH, shows he still has the directorial goods here despite the poor health he suffered during its making (Wayne reportedly directed significant sequences, but refused to take credit or have Sherman taken off). BIG JAKE also has superlative cinematography by William Clothier, no stranger to Westerns he, all of which was done on location in what had become the Duke's favorite Western locale--the landscape around Durango, Mexico. The only really serious disappointment with BIG JAKE is that Wayne and O'Hara barely have any screen time together, given how well they worked under Ford, particularly on 1952's THE QUIET MAN, and seeing as how this was their last joint appearance on screen (Wayne died in 1979, and O'Hara wouldn't make another feature film until ONLY THE LONELY in 1991).Still, just about everything else one expects from the Duke on screen happens here in BIG JAKE, including those little bits of humor revolving around being called ""Daddy"" and being thought dead. It's just a lesson to you: You don't mess with the Duke.And you definitely don't call him Daddy either!",Big Jake
42,michaelarmer,Another Wayne Vehicle,5,14 January 2020,"Its another daft one from John Wayne, pairing up again with Maureen O'Hara, and Chris Mitchum, and with one of his sons, Wayne still has not mastered the art of acting yet, but he is getting better.The storyline is ok, but a lot of the acting/performing is not so good, with obvious flaws, such as why some people let themselves get killed so easily ? and why at the end they don't bother to check on/bury the old Indian Tracker (Bruce Cabot) that helped them, nor the dog, so its a bit ridiculous in parts, it was made in 1971, every other film had moved on by then, fast action and credible scenes, but not here, it was like it was made 20 years earlier!But still adventurous and entertaining, the best actor was the dog, followed closely by Richard Boone who always seemed to play bad guys well.Not the best but certainly not the worst.",Big Jake
43,angelsunchained,Despite the horrible acting,8,13 October 2018,"I liked this film. I gave it an eight. However, some of the worse acting in history takes place. John Wayne's nine year old son is possibly the worst child actor in history. Sorry, but the kid couldn't act. Chris Mitchum and Bobby Vinton are just as bad; stiff and wooden and sound like they are reading their dialogue. Even the dog stinks. The only bright light is Richard Boone as a psycho's psycho. Bruce Cabot, Patrick Wayne and Glen Corbett sleep walk through their roles. But, I am a big fan of the Duke and I still enjoyed Big Jake.",Big Jake

After seeing Big Jake many times, I only wish Maureen O'Hara and John Wayne made more movies together. They had the greatest chemistry in movie history. Richard Boone gave an outstanding performance as the artful villian keeping one step ahead of Jake at every turn. Bruce Cabot as Sam Sharpnose put on an acting clinic as the much needed Indian tracker. Patrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum kept just the right tension as Jake's estranged sons. Too many other great actors here to mention but they all gave memorable performances. This all star cast, John Wayne's family on and off the screen produced a magnificent film for the ages.",Big Jake
45,daniewhite-1,Big Jokes,4,22 April 2020,"Following one year after 'Chisum' John Wayne plays the same character but this time seperated from his wife rather than a bachelor who lost out in love to his deceased brother. Plus he has a dog called 'Dog' and comedy sons to ""aid"" in the rescue mission to recover his violently kidnapped grandson ""little Jake"".With 'Chisum' the whole film flows along, like a fat river on flat ground, never very original or powerful but doing a steady even job by a lot of people who could make the film in their sleep until a fairly bombastic climax.'Big Jake' tries to be more inventive, and introduce more moving parts but overall this more involved scenario is less enjoyable due to incredibly broad character and situation writing, stiff acting, poor sound quality, middling score and unconvincing practical effects and stuntwork. However the final act does provide entertainment value which saves the film with two shootouts that are fairly well put together and adequately well brought off. Plus the middle stretches of 'Big Jake' have nice amber, golden hued, location cinematography.I slightly prefer it's predecessor but not by a great deal: in 'Big Jake' a comedic tone plays with technology and parentage at the expense of John Wayne's crotchety hero but apart from a couple of throw away lines for Wayne the writing is so broad and the acting so stiff that it's a waste of the more involved themes.With the technical limitations already considered I rate a 4/10 and I recommend only to people who are already fans of John Wayne's ""late phase"" westerns because the last act of 'Big Jake' is OK: with a good bit of tension and bravado and action, if a rather sudden and sharp finish; plus the photography is charming during the earlier scenes.",Big Jake
46,Mr. OpEd,Your fault. My fault. I'm gonna blow your head off!,10,21 April 1999,"That's one of my favorite lines from this picture and the way it's delivered, both times, is thrilling. Violent and bloody (and Bernstein's music makes one of the machete attacks even worse, his sense of drama is so good!) so don't let pre-teens or the impressionable see it! Boone is an awesome villain and Wayne and his ""dog"" make an odd hero combo. Big Jake is a big film, depicting the end of the cowboy era, without bemoaning the passing, and deftly incorporating new technology with the old. The tension between Wayne and his three boys is fine and there's some funny scenes, too. Highly recommended. PS: a Big Jake fan wrote into Entertainment Magazine in the 80s that this was one of his favorite Wayne films; the EM staff had never heard of it. I canceled my subscription.",Big Jake

Here's where the Duke does the stuff he's good at, dry humor, laying down the law, and pulling no punches. The whole ""Your fault, my fault, nobody's fault..."" exchange is Classic!! It's a great family reunion (John, Patrick, and Ethan). His oft costar Bruce Cabot does great in his supporting role. As well, the Duke and O'Hara show splendid chemistry in their final costarring.

With added motor cars in a weird comedy aspect which are taken out by a single baddy bullet. I thought cowboys had died out by 1909 but no here they are shooting up the whole town murdering willy- nilly. Cowboys this stoopid didn't last as long as some here. Yes the baddies are archetypically unshaven and plain evil. Big John Payne as usual impervious to pain ,is no match for them and arrives as if by magic to save everyone even though he's been away from his family for years. There follows minimal exposition and 3 sons not surprisingly miffed at this idiot and his absence from their lives. A shocker.",Big Jake

In the early scene with the sheepherder, Dog appears to be a solid black collie. In the end of the scene in which Christopher Mitchum plays dead and Wayne slugs him for it, Dog appears to be a bright brown color with a wide swatch of blue or blue merle around his neck and down into his ruff. At other times, Dog appears to be solid dark brown. I've seen blue merle collies before, but I've never seen one that blended blue and brown like that.",Big Jake

The story is simple,a person asked by his ex-wife to save her grandson from Bandits who have demanded ransom, but it was entertaining at the same time which was complimented well with acting. The role of was a tailor made for Duke. Hadn't he been in this movie then it wouldn't have been worth watching it. The supporting cast of Patrick Wayne,Christopher Mitchum and Bruce Cabot was excellent. The Richard Boone as the villain was also tremendous and was on par with Duke. The action scenes were first rate and funny. Along with The Shootist and Cowboys this movie can be ranked as one of the best film of Duke of his later career.",Big Jake

Bruce Cabot playing an Indian just does not work for me. Sometimes his English is choppy, and sometimes he sounds like Hamlet. Good grief. Did not care for the machete hacking at all.

John Wayne's character, big Jake, is an estranged husband and father who comes back to rescue his nephew. He has this invincible, super hero aura. There are those ""old western"" humorous scenes to break the hardness of the story, I guess.The resulting movie is however, very watchable, surprisingly violent compared to what I was expecting.

54,charlywiles,The Duke and Maureen - one last time,5,30 August 2017,"I'm a huge fan of John Wayne and this was the first Wayne western I saw in a theater on first release. It's a treat seeing Wayne and O'Hara again and many of the veteran character actors such as Bruce Cabot, Harry Carey, Jr. and Hank Worden that have appeared in many films with the Duke. Richard Boone also gives a marvelous performance as the vicious villain and he's the perfect foil for Wayne in the film. No one could play a slimy bad-guy like Boone. Having said all that however, this still is not a very good picture. The direction is shoddy (reportedly director Sherman was ill during the shoot and Wayne directed scenes himself), the script weak and many of the performances are sub-par (Patrick Wayne is particularly bad). Most of the humor in the film comes across as forced and some of the violence is kind of gratuitous and in bad taste. This was typical of most of Wayne's 1970's films (the exceptions are the classic ""The Shootist"" and the underrated ""The Cowboys""), he often gave clichéd performances during this era and was mostly just going through the motions and playing his ""personna."" I almost gagged when I saw an earlier reviewer state that this is better than ""The Searchers."" Sorry - not even close. Still, it's The Duke and most of the movie is kind of fun - just don't compare it with Wayne's best Westerns. ""Stagecoach,"" ""Red River,"" ""Rio Bravo,"" ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" and the aforementioned ""The Searchers"" and ""The Shootist"" are all miles ahead.",Big Jake

56,WandrinStar,Big Jake (1971),6,23 January 2012,"(6/10) Conflicting opinions on this western, although it is slightly above average than most western films in the early seventies. Movie started off strong, including a very entertaining opening montage that highlighted life in 1909. The final shootout was one of Wayne's best in his later westerns, and I appreciated the bloody and dark tones that were missing in many of Duke's pictures. Middle part of the film drug on with less than inspiring performances by Patrick Wayne and Christopher Mitchum, although Boone played a nice villain. Lacked originality is comparison to other Wayne westerns: kidnap/rescue plot from The Searchers, dog as a partner like in Hondo, etc. Disappointed that O'Hara was in MIA after the first thirty minutes and the film ended too abruptly failing to resolve several issues such as the fate of Big Jake's son who was shot in the beginning. Highlight of the film was when Wayne's real life son playing Little Jake first met Big Jake and asked if he was his grandpa.",Big Jake

This movie has something for everyone, but be warned it has plenty of violence and is definitely a PG/ PG13 type film.The supporting cast is excellent with Patrick Wayne, Christopher Mitchum, Richard Boone,Bruce Cabot, Maureen O'Hara, Gregg Palmer and Dog turning in solid performances.While there are the formulaic elements such as horrendous acts perpetuated by bad men that give license to the good guys to do whatever is necessary to right the wrong, Big Jake also has other elements that make this film not just another Western:1) Takes place in transition period of the turn of the century which provides some interesting interaction between the old ways and new ways. 2) Fun relationships and interplay between an estranged father and his young adult sons. 3) Great mixture of fun and intense gritty action. (John Wayne movies are known for this)Consequently - If you like Westerns this is a classic that you will enjoy.If you are a fan of John Wayne at all this is a must see film.If you are just looking for a good gritty action film with a healthy dose of humor seamlessly woven in to the story you will not be disappointed.Ultimately, this is one of my favorite John Wayne films.",Big Jake

Big Jake is one large blob of ham, cheese, hilarious stereotypes, amateur dialog, lousy acting and some of the worst sound dubbing this side of a high school review.

When he was a young man John Wayne once said he'd have to retire when he reached forty because after that you couldn't play a believable hero. Well, here he is at 63, still kicking ass with the best of them! BIG JAKE has a sense of self-referential humor about it that I find irresistible (the ""I thought you wuz dead?"" running gag, for example). Written by the screenwriters of DIRTY HARRY, this movie always struck me as their attempt to send up the larger than life image of The Duke in the most affectionate possible way. Wayne's introductory shot (and the line leading up to it) makes me laugh out loud every time I see it (it was cut from a TNT showing of the movie a few years ago, making me howl with such outrage that my kids cracked up!). The only thing I don't like about this movie is the callousness of much of the violence. I know Richard Boone and his gang are being set up as the baddest of the baddies, but women and children being hacked to bits with a machete is a bit much. Still, not enough to ruin BIG JAKE for me.

The movie moved at a good pace and the blending of technology and the west in 1909 was interesting but the acting by Mitchum stunk up the whole film. The motorcycle scene during the shootout and the soundtrack of the film was a rip off of The Great Escape. Also, while motorcycles may have been around in 1909, I doubt they were of caliber to make jumps across boulders and ravines.Also, Wayne's constant reference to his dog as ""Dog"" was suppose to provide a little comic relief I suppose but it grew old after a while.Also, when Richard Boone's ransom note demanded $1 million dollars, I immediately thought of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers. I doubt gangs in 1909 would demand that much. I could be wrong but I see a ransom request of $200k or $300k to be more believable.",Big Jake

O'Hara is excellent as the matriarch, and Boone plays the villain to perfection.Set at the turn of the 19th century you see a passing of an age; the mechanical age is supplanting that of the horse driven age.

69,knight_hawk2002,Violently Good,7,19 August 2007,"From the outset 'Big Jake' will always be a firm favourite of mine, it's the first John Wayne movie I can recall watching, and this is the movie that has made him my all-time favourite movie star and actor.The movie follows Dukes pursuit of seven kidnappers whom killed a large number of people at his former ranch (now run by his estranged wife) and kidnapped his grandson.Up until this point in John Wayne's career he had by in large refrained from using excessive violence in his movies. However it could be argued and with some basis that movies such as 'True Grit', 'The Green Berets' and 'The Alamo' to name but three were physically violent in their own right. Regardless of this however 'Big Jake' was to be a dramatic departure for John Wayne due to the fact that on numerous occasions it give an honest depiction of physical violence. The opening shootout at the Candles ranch is a prime example of this, the sequence is extremely well executed by the director and stunt co-coordinators and there are many examples gunshot wounds which add to the realism of the movie.The screenplay is rather slick with ample action included to satisfy audience expectations. The movie does contain many memorable scenes such as the opening and closing shootouts, Dukes casual killing of a would be assassin and some touching and at times volatile scenes involving Jake and his ex wife played eloquently by the great Maureen O'Hara.An interesting segment at the start involves a voice-over retelling the transformation of the west from the early 1800's to its relatively civilised state in 1909 (when the film is set). The voice-over also introduces the audience to nine bandits whom act as the heavies in the movie, its fascinating to hear a brief introduction of each bandit and what skill they bring to the group e.g. Fain is the leader, O'Brien the gunfighter and John Goodfellow is proficient with a machete etc etc.Duke in this movie is accompanied is his pursuit if the kidnappers by a trusted dog (who is very violent) an Indian friend played very well by Bruce Cabot, and his two on screen sons James (Patrick Wayne who is Dukes own son) and Michael (Chris Mitchum). The main protagonist in the movie is John Fain played superbly by Richard Boone and some of the scenes between him and John Wayne are very memorable containing both tension and style. John Wayne's youngest son John Ethan Wayne makes his debut in this movie playing the kidnapped grandson of Jake and acquits himself very impressively to the field of acting.Despite my fondness for this movie it is not however without its weaknesses, for one the acting by both Patrick Wayne and Chris Mitchum is horrendous and neither one manages to endear the audience to their respective characters. Some sloppy direction also resulted in the disappearance of one of the Fain gang early in the movie, despite being given an introduction at the start of the movie; young Billy simply disappears without any explanation right at the beginning of the raid on the McCandles ranch. Several campfire scenes that are set at night appear much too bright; the director should have masked the lens on the camera more in order to ensure the scenes effectiveness. Finally several stunts involving Mitchum and a motorcycle come across as tired, overblown and generally dull although the director rightly erased the motorcycle from the movie quite early on much to the relief of the audience.Critics were less than impressed with the movie stating that it was 'overly violent', these were the same critics who praised the Wild Bunch months earlier for being innovative and honest in its depiction of violence. Despite what he critics stated and some of the minor criticisms I have pointed out about this movie it remains a firm favourite and was a big box office hit when first released.",Big Jake
70,pcsimonson1651,John Wayne's worst Movie,1,31 August 2013,"This basic idea of this movie had potential but, the acting was stiff, everyone seemed like they were just saying lines for the sake of saying them, no pathos, no feeling, nothing convincing about the acting or lines can be found in this. Way too much stupid stuff was portrayed by all. The ""Rangers"" who were supposed to be these great shots, had a hard time even getting close to the ambushers, and they were standing up, like they wanted to get shot! And of course,the ambushers were picking off the Rangers real easy. Way too many unbelievable moments were had by all. Way too many dumb, unconvincing lines by actors that were great in other Wayne films!",Big Jake
71,mcgx6,John Wayne at his larger than life best!!,9,5 September 2021,"As bad as the actors and acting, save for John Wayne, was in his last film ""Rio Lobo"", This movie has some fine actors and acting. John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Richard Boone, even Bruce Cabot in an unusual role. Plus Harry Carey Jr. And as always Hank Worden!!! All he ever wanted was a rocking chair by the fire!!! The story is engaging and who doesn't like a good revenge movie. Will there be anyone who doesn't like this movie? ""Not hardly""!!!! John Wayne is most certainly not a harsh and unpleasant kind of man!!!!",Big Jake
72,georgeorwell-27697,"My ""Go To"" Duke film",9,23 March 2019,"Great actors, great writers and great directors make great films. Add the Duke sparring with the immortal Richard Boone and you have movie magic. The movie starts in the year 1909, the ending of the West of legend. Cars and motorcycles have made their entrance in everyday life. Against this backdrop a band of crooks and cowboys, led by Richard Boone, plans a heist to set them up for life. They kidnap little Jake, Big Jake's grandson, kill cow hands and an innocent cook leave and another son lying in near death. They demand a million dollar ransom for the life of the boy. Mrs. McCandle (played by Maureen O'Hara), States the only one who can deliver the money and get her grandson home safely is her estranged husband, Big Jacob McCandles. Big Jake takes the job and is accompanied by his friend Sam Sharpnose (Bruce Cabot) and his two sons, James (Patrick Wayne) and Michael (Chris Mitchum), along with a dog named.....Dog. Big pluses to Patrick Wayne and Chris Mitchum. Patrick plays Big Jake's short-tempered, fast-draw son, and IMHO it's his best role. Chris Mitchum shines as his cerebral son, much more respectful of Big Jake and a dead long-shot with a rifle. The journey to deliver the money becomes a hero's arc as it helps the father and sons mend the years Jake was away. Finally, the interaction between Richard Boone (as the head of the band) and John Wayne is epic.This is one of those movies when I'm flipping channels that I never fail to watch. Give it a look, just to see great acting, and you'll see.",Big Jake
73,Kerbob,Awesome Flick,10,5 May 1999,"Wayne is at his best when he is sent by his estranged wife (O'Hara) to deliver a ransom to be paid to a band of western thugs who have taken his grandson hostage.The film is largely over-looked or under-rated, but if you are looking for a good John Wayne movie, buy it, rent it.Which ever, way just see it!",Big Jake
74,jenbpeace,"I really tried to like it, I just didn't.",3,25 December 2019,"Maybe you have to like westerns, I don't know. I am truly baffled at all the positive reviews of this movie. The character Jake is basically a deadbeat dad and a cold violent person. He shows love for his sons by punching them out cold. He doesn't bother to name his dog and orders the dog around and simply calls him ""dog"". Jake doesn't seem to care about life or death, not even when his dog gets horribly killed at the end. Nobody seemed to care. I found this very offensive.
And the acting....well, pretty bad from start to finish. John Wayne was OK I guess. Maureen O'Hara, her character, I dunno man, I couldn't figure out if it was just horrible acting or a cold character that she was playing. She watches her household get murdered and her grandson kidnapped by the murderers and the expression on her face is that of someone who just discovered fungus gnats in their favorite houseplant.
And the strange scenes with the dare devil motorcycle riding, the guy losing control of his handgun, and the one with the guy getting shot and banging into the church bells like a pinball machine...um...wha??? Was this supposed to be a comedy, too? It just didn't work.",Big Jake
75,gmaloney1,One of Wayne's best,8,14 March 2006,"I agree with one of the preceding comments, that ""Big Jake"" is better than ""The Searchers."" In fact, I have watched ""the Searchers"" several times and cannot understand why many critics praise it as Wayne's best. ""Big Jake,"" ""Hondo"" and ""The Shootist"" outrank Searchers, in my opinion... (except for the appearance of Vera Miles, my favorite Pratt, Kansas lovely). ""She wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is a good Wayne film. Very entertaining is ""Rio Lobo."" Jack Elam's switch from bad guy to comedy is super! The writers of Big Jake, Hondo, Rooster Cogburn and the Shootist composed the right words and actions to showcase the best John Wayne character.",Big Jake
76,mwentworth-604-501263,Best Version of Wayne Sharing a Moral Code,10,26 August 2018,"I once told a friend, ""All I needed to learn in life I learned from Big Jake."" Next to The Shootist, this film clearly communicates Wayne's moral code. Maureen O'Hara is the strong independent woman who respects and admires Wayne's moral code. ""Your mother and I aren't going to pay them for that!"" is a perfect example. O'Hara and Wayne clearly have a different point of view...call it political...but when it comes to dealing with evil, they unite. Highly recommend watching it once a year to keep the spirit of the film alive.",Big Jake
77,gmead02,bayshore NY drive-in,7,18 September 2012,"I believe it was the last film I saw in the old Bayshore 5th avenue drive-in (not the bayshore sunrise drive-in). Websites claim the drive-in's last season was 1964, but to those that remember it closed much later. I think during or after that summer (1971)when the screen was torn in half by a tree after a storm. Either way, this film was a good old-fashioned western that came out in a time when westerns became revisionist garbage (""Doc""), or had political undertones that paralleled the view of some on the Vietnam war (Ulzana's raid, soldier blue, pat garrett and billy the kid)- not to say these were bad films, but it was the direction many films were going at that time. ""Big Jake"" made a statement about the changing times and how certain old tried-and-true methods were tried-and-true for a reason. Wayne knew full well what he was doing; his popularity was so for many reasons, one of which was tried-and-true movie-making. Good was good, bad was bad and people just wanted to sit back and enjoy rooting for the hero. This is not to say he didn't make westerns with gray areas, but when he did it was more a case in character study than political statements for the purpose of revision.",Big Jake

81,rubinmail-one,Love the Duke!!,8,17 February 2005,"First I have to say that I am a huge JW fan. In this film JW is his classic Kick A** self. There is some sentimental stuff in here, about the old man's relationship with his grown sons. Basically it is good old John Wayne Action. When the bad guys get the drop on him, all you can think is ""Big mistake"" This film is set in the early 1900s. There is an interesting parallel between the passing of the baton from one generation to the next (Jake and his grown sons) and the passing of technology. We see new fangled weapons and a motor car. (Naturally Jake rejects these)Finally: You got to love the idea of Big Jake owning a dog named ..... DOG.",Big Jake
