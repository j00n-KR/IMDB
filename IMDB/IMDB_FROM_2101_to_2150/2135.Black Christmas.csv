0,Leofwine_draca,Hugely influential slasher/horror is nearly a match for Halloween,10,4 December 2015,"A classic exercise in subtlety, this film prefers to leave the horror to the imagination rather than splattering it graphically across our screens. And it benefits as a result of this. In fact, the film has the (dubious) distinction of being the first 'proper' slasher film, influencing many others that were to come later, including the classic HALLOWEEN.The director, Bob Clark, was no stranger to horror films, having directed CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. With Black Christmas, he popularised many of the clichés we are used to seeing in horror films today, such as the obscene telephone calls. Of course, when this film was made these ideas were still fresh, and not clichés at all. There's also the POV shot from the killer in the opening scene, which was used again to great success in HALLOWEEN. Due to the success of the latter, this film remains neglected in the annals of horror, and is not credited with the creation of the numerous clichés which slasher horrors of the 1980s contained.One big advantage this film has over the many other slasher films around is the realism and atmosphere. For instance, the characters in the film are totally realistic, and all have traits which make them interesting. Margot Kidder is fine as the foul-mouthed alcoholic and Olivia Hussey is excellent as the main heroine. Obviously parallels are to be drawn between her character and Jamie Lee Curtis' character in HALLOWEEN, but I would go so far to say that Hussey creates a more believable person in this film, someone to really empathise with. John Saxon is on hand once again to play a policeman (what else?) and personally I find him totally capable in the role as well - he offers a hard, but kind presence, someone who you can turn to for help, which is exactly what a policeman should be.There's also a little bit of comedy, revolving around a slow policeman at the station. The killer's manic telephone calls are totally disturbing and offer a contrast to the silent menace of Michael Myers. This killer is insane! With lots of atmospheric scenes and an unsettling ending guaranteed to stay with you long after the film has finished playing, this is really one of the best slasher films there is, a film strong enough on chills to cope without the welter of blood and gore and inventive deaths we are used to seeing.",Black Christmas
1,SnoopyStyle,Serial killer and a Sorority - before panty shots were the norm,6,8 October 2013,"It's Christmas break, but there's a serial killer terrorizing a college sorority. First there are the crank calls. Then he starts killing. This is a horror movie from Bob Clark who would be better known later for 'A Christmas Story', and the Porky's franchise. He's certainly much better in comedies than horror. He doesn't have the touch to juice up the intensity. This movie is far too slow. The kills have limited shock value.The den mother is boozy Mrs Mac. Margot Kidder plays the brash Barb. Olivia Hussey plays the pregnant Jess who's considering abortion. Andrea Martin plays Phyl. When they report a missing girl, the police is unconcerned, busy with a missing 13 year old girl named Janice Quaife. However Lt Fuller (John Saxon) soon realizes that there is something wrong going on.When a modern horror movie of a serial killer in a sorority, it's expected to have hot young co-eds strutting around in their panties. This was before that all started. It does have some modern touches like a killer's POV. But the lack of editing and its slow pace do hold it back. I consider it a transition piece that don't quite measure up to its more scary compatriots.",Black Christmas
2,mark.waltz,"Not the type of film I'd watch over the holidays, but much better than I expected.",6,9 February 2021,"The mixture of the holiday season and slasher horror isn't exactly what I'd call a proper mix for the Christmas season, but for some reason, this one comes off unscathed thanks to a tense atmosphere aided by a witty screenplay. it deals with three women staying at their sorority for the holidays, Olivia Hussey, Margo Kidder and Andrea mtartin, and stalked by a psychotic killer who keeps calling them with very spooky threats. The audience witnesses one of the girls, preparing to leave, becoming a victim of the killer, and her disappearance is what sets off the mystery. Marian Waldman, as the dipsomaniac house mother, steals the film, obviously emulating veteran comic Patsy Kelly with her boisterous manner. Then there's John Saxon as the police lieutenant, perplexed by the incompetence of his sergeants and doing his best to solve the mystery.The young Margo Kidder is very funny as an extremely sarcastic and foul mouthed student, very sexually graphic in her manner and not someone who will be told to act like a lady. Ironic, it's the sweet looking hussy who is pregnant out of wedlock, threatening to get an abortion and threatened by her boyfriend who is against it. The young Andrea Martin, long before she became famous for her comic portrayals and show stopping stage roles, is their nerdy friend, staying put even though there is danger around.This is one of those films I have avoided watching simply because I don't think that the holidays should be exploited like this but I did find this much better once I got into it. Taking it several steps beyond the TV movie thriller very popular at this time especially those surrounding sorority girls in jeopardy, this manages to take a rather exploitive premise and makes it gripping. It's not the gore that becomes scary. It's the frightening phone calls with sound effects and screams that will really keep you on edge. I may not wrap this up to put it under my Christmas tree, but I am glad that I did not avoid watching it when the opportunity came around.",Black Christmas
3,claudio_carvalho,Simple but Very Dark and Suspenseful Horror Movie,7,19 November 2009,"In Bedford, most of the girls of the sorority house Pi Kappa Sigma that is administrated by Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) travel in the Christmas holiday to the houses of their families. Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) schedules to meet her father on the afternoon; however, an intruder kills her in her room, hides her body in the attic and Mr. Harrison (James Edmond) never sees his daughter. Meanwhile Jess (Olivia Hussey) receives obscene anonymous phone calls while Phyl (Andrea Martin) and Barb (Margot Kidder) go to the precinct with Mr. Harrison to report that Clare is missing. Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller (John Saxon) is interviewing a mother that reported that her thirteen year-old daughter has never got home and the police organize a search party. When they find the body of the girl in a park, Lt. Fuller asks to bug the telephone of the sisters. Meanwhile the prowler has killed Mrs. Mac and is stalking the three sisters.""Black Christmas"" is a simple but very dark and suspenseful horror movie. The deranged serial-killer is never seen and the slightly ambiguous conclusion clearly indicates that Peter had nothing to do with the murders or calls, and the incompetent police officers do not find the bodies of Clare and Mrs. Mac. In 1979, the idea of a psychopathic killer calling from the inside of the house was brilliantly used in the creepy ""When a Stranger Calls"". The future Superman's girlfriend Margot Kidder is very beautiful but her character is completely fool. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Noite do Terror"" (""Night of the Terror"")Note: On 03 July 2020, I saw this film again.",Black Christmas
4,kosmasp,First,6,9 May 2007,"I've got to admit, that I'm not into mindless slashers that much. If they're nicely made and or have great death scenes, they can be ""fun"" though! This one of the first slashers though and it seems like other slasher movies, have a lot to be thankful for, concerning boundary breaking ideas! Having said that, you have to feel free to enjoy a movie with no plot whatsoever, with girls (victims) on a Christmas day and a killer on the loose. That's all you get (plus a few death scenes of course) and if that's you're cup of tea, why not watch this movie and see how they did it in the 70s. Much better than the remake then!",Black Christmas
5,gavin6942,The Horror Film That Started It All,9,26 December 2006,"Before Bob Clark made ""Porky's"" or ""A Christmas Story"", he made this lost classic: ""Black Christmas"". A sorority house is infiltrated by a serial killer who is probably mentally deranged. Being Christmas, the police are overburdened and the girls are drunk. Who can save them? Can they be saved? This film excels at everything. The mood is very good. The casting is great (Olivia Hussey is fantastic, and a young Margot Kidder steals the show). The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. This really lays the groundwork for films to come.And this is what makes ""Black Christmas"" so great. Besides a foul-mouthed Santa Claus and the feeding of alcohol to children, we have the beginning of some of the most well-known horror clichés. ""Halloween"" borrows the first person camera angles, and all slashers in general take something from this movie (since, to my knowledge, this was the first movie featuring drunk kids hacked up by an outside intruder).""When A Stranger Calls"" borrows heavily, as does ""Scream"". The horror comedy ""Student Bodies"" (now very hard to find, and not even on Netflix at all) takes so much from ""Black Christmas"" it should have made them royalties. In short, once you've seen this horror film you've really seen them all.Some have said the music was noteworthy. Personally, I didn't notice the music -- but I'll just assume that means it fit the mood well. What I did notice was the voice of The Moaner. Films with phantom callers are not unusual, but I don't think any of them do what this film does with the creep. Some strange calls.There is a subplot of a killed girl and of a possible abortion. These story lines never get resolved but work to reinforce the tension in the air. And unlike every other horror film, there is no ""Black Christmas 2"". I commend them for that choice... will the remakers make the same decision? If you haven't seen this film, see it. You've been eating your hot fudge sundaes without the ice cream, and it's time for that to change.",Black Christmas
6,lee_eisenberg,all kinds of crossroads,10,18 July 2007,"OK, you've probably heard that Bob Clark's (RIP) ""Black Christmas"" is basically the original slasher movie, the inspiration for John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". Well, let me just say that - in response to the tag-line - my skin did actually crawl a little bit during some of the phone calls! Of course, that doesn't even begin to identify what makes this such a scary movie. Aside from not knowing the killer's identity, some of the scenes towards the end really catch you.But that's only one cool aspect. The cast includes Olivia Hussey (Juliet in ""Romeo and Juliet""), Keir Dullea (Dave in ""2001: A Space Odyssey""), Margot Kidder (Lois in ""Superman"") and John Saxon (Roper in ""Enter the Dragon""); no doubt when Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea appeared in their most famous roles in 1968, they never imagined that they would co-star in this sort of movie. Director Bob Clark is most famous for ""A Christmas Story"" and the ""Porky's"" movies; seriously, what kind of person can lay claim to directing movies as different as these, plus ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things""? But the main point is that this is the mother of all slasher movies. Like ""The Jazz Singer"" to sound, like ""I Haven't Got a Hat"" to the Looney Tunes, like ""I Love Lucy"" to sitcoms, everything started here. No matter how you look at it, ""Black Christmas"", for lack of a better word, is DA BOMB! Not only do the cast members truly have something about which to proud, but it goes to show what we lost when Bob Clark got killed in a car wreck earlier this year.PS: the special edition DVD includes an interview with Olivia Hussey (and she still looks quite good after all these years). She didn't see the completed film until many years later, as horror flicks scare her. Well, I think that it's practically a guarantee that at least one scene in this movie will scare you. Because as Olivia Hussey notes, the idea of there being something creepy out there is scarier than knowing what's there.",Black Christmas
7,jboothmillard,Black Christmas,6,13 December 2009,"This film was promoted in 1974 with the tagline ""If this picture doesn't make your skin crawl, it's on too tight!"", and practically wrote the rulebook for all future slasher scary movies, including Halloween (released four years later). It was only because of the 2019 remake coming up that I thought to watch this 1974 original again, and I'm glad I did, directed by Bob Clark (Porky's, A Christmas Story, Baby Geniuses, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2). Basically, during the Christmas holidays, an unseen and disoriented man climbs up into the attic of a sorority house. One of the sorority sisters, Jess (Death on the Nile's Olivia Hussey), answers an obscene phone call from a mentally unstable man. It is implied that the caller has been calling the house regularly, other girls gather as the voice (Nick Mancuso) screams and curses them on the phone. Foul-mouthed Barb (Superman's Margot Kidder) takes the phone from Jess, she provokes the caller, who in turn threatens to kill her. Clare Harrison argues with Barb, she is worried that the caller could be a serial rapist. While in her bedroom packing for Christmas break, the stranger lures Clare into the closet, where she is suffocated by a plastic bag, and her dead body is placed on a chair in the attic. The following morning, Mr. Harrison (James Edmond) arrives at the school to pick up his daughter, but she does not show up at their agreed meeting place. At the sorority house, the housemother, Mrs. ""Mac"" MacHenry (Marian Waldman), is surprised by Clare's absence. Meanwhile, Jess meets her boyfriend, Peter (2001: A Space Odyssey's Keir Dullea), a neurotic music student. She tells Peter that she is pregnant and planning to get an abortion, angering him. In town, Mr. Harrison, accompanied by Barb and another of the girls, Phyllis ""Phyl"" Carlson (Andrea Martin), attempt to report Clare as missing, while Jess tells Clare's boyfriend Chris Hayden (Art Hindle) about Clare's sudden disappearance. They learn that another local girl named Janis Quaife has also seemingly vanished while walking home from school. While a drunken Barb is put to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris, Jess, and Phyllis help search for Janis, hoping also to find Clare. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac is lured up into the attic, where she discovers Clare's body. The killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. Janis's disfigured body is found by the police in the park, Jess returns, while the search for Clare continues. Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to appear and surprise her. He tries to persuade her into marrying him for the sake of their child, but Jess refuses. Peter leaves emotional, while Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller (A Nightmare on Elm Street's John Saxon) arrives to bug the telephone. While Jess is distracted by a choir of children arriving at the house carol singing, the killer enters Barb's bedroom. Barb is murdered her with a glass figurine, but her screams are drowned out by the singing children. After the children leave, Jess answers another unnerving phone call, and mentions the conversation between her and Peter. Lieutenant Fuller theorises that Peter could be responsible, due to the caller's knowledge of the argument and his mentality, but Jess doubts it. Moments later, Phyllis enters Barb's room and is ambushed by the killer, who murders her off-screen. Jess answers the telephone again, she stays on the line long enough to be traced by telephone company employee Bill Graham (Leslie ""Les"" Carlson). Sergeant Nash (Douglas ""Doug"" McGrath) instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls have been traced to be coming from within the sorority house. Jess arms herself with a poker and ventures upstairs, where she discovers Barb and Phyllis's maimed bodies. The killer appears and pursues Jess through the house, she locks herself in the cellar, while Peter appears outside one of the windows. He smashes the window to get to Jess, who proceeds to bludgeon him with the poker, assuming he is the killer. The police arrive, alerted by Jess's screams. They discover her barely conscious in the basement, with Peter's body next to her. They put Jess to bed and discuss the murders, unaware that the bodies of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry are still in the attic. While Jess is resting, with a policeman standing outside. The killer climbs down from the attic into her bedroom, Jess's fate is unknown, and the telephone begins to ring as the credits roll. Also starring Michael Rapport as Patrick, Leslie Carlson as Graham, Martha Gibson as Mrs. Quaife and Robert Warner as Doctor. Hussey and Kidder among the other young actresses give good performances as the victims to the maniac stalking them on the phone and in the house. This is a good slap in the face to the traditional festive movie full of happy families and joy, it feels creepy, and the kills are reasonably inventive, the bag death being the most memorable (featuring in both remakes), overall it's not a bad seasonal slasher horror. Good!",Black Christmas
8,Woodyanders,A splendidly scary & spooky 70's seasonal slasher landmark,9,1 May 2006,"Made a good four years prior to John Carpenter's phenomenally hair-raising terror movie watershed ""Halloween,"" this superbly scary and suspenseful ahead-of-its-time seasonal slasher trailblazer laid the basic groundwork for the countless similarly plotted holiday-themed horror entries which followed in its influential wake throughout the late 70's and up until the mid 80's.The then fresh and novel, now stale and generic premise centers on a frightfully maniacal cackling lunatic who escapes from an asylum and holes up in the dusty attic of a nearby college sorority house on December 24th. At first the babbling, profanity-screaming nutjob taunts the sorority girls with disturbing obscene phone calls before proceeding to pick off the hapless lasses one at a time. Eventually a token lovely coed (sympathetically played by the astonishingly gorgeous Olivia Hussey) has to face the murderous kook on her own (said only lady left heroine is called in slasher movie parlance ""the final girl,"" which later became a huge cliché in subsequent slice'n'dice features). Director Benjamin ""Bob"" Clark, who had previously helmed the superior zombie pictures ""Deathdream"" and ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" (Clark's latter efforts include the first two uproariously raunchy ""Porky's"" films and, amazingly enough, the disarmingly sweet yuletide treat ""A Christmas Story""!) masterfully creates and sustains a genuinely eerie and nerve-jangling atmosphere while establishing such standard body count movie components as hand-held subjective camera shots of the killer on the prowl, bravura murder set pieces (suffocation with plastic bag, impalement on hook, and, in the single most stunning kill scene, a comely honey being stabbed to death with a crystal unicorn ornament that's brilliantly inter-cut with an angelic children's choir singing ""Sleep in Heavenly Peace"" with positively haunting and harrowing results), a creepy mystery wacko whose true identity is never revealed, a few red herring secondary characters (notably Keir Dullea as Hussey's neurotic, violently temperamental pianist boyfriend), a riveting last reel showdown with a brave and resourceful heroine asserting her proto-feminist strength and independence by doing in the killer all by her lonesome, and a socko surprise ending.Cleverly written by Ray Moore, the neatly twisty script further adds several riotous dollops of bawdy humor to leaven the unnerving tension and an intelligent reason why the initial murder victims aren't immediately missed (they left early for the holidays). Reginald Morris' strikingly crisp and agile cinematography vividly captures the stark bleakness of the severely cold wintry landscape, thereby greatly enhancing the overall literally and figuratively chilling mood. The cast all turn in bang-up performances: Margot Kidder vamps it up hilariously as a hysterically brash and slutty tramp, Marion Waldman likewise amuses as the outrageously vulgar den mother, John Saxon is properly stalwart in the first of many concerned police chief parts (a role he reprised to perfection in ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""), ""The Brood"" 's Art Hindle lurks around the edges as a hunky frat boy, David Cronenberg regular Art (""Videodrome,"" ""The Fly"") Hindle pops up as a helpful cop, Doug McGrath supplies side-splitting comic relief as a geeky desk sergeant, and a pre-""SCTV"" Andrea Martin is engaging as a mousy sorority sister. Smart, absorbing and above all profoundly frightening, ""Black Christmas"" will most assuredly give you the willies any old time of the year.",Black Christmas
9,Tweekums,Attacker in the attic,8,26 December 2009,"Sitting down on Christmas Night I wanted to watch something suitably seasonal so chose this classic '70s horror flick. I was expecting something very dated, overly leery, badly acted and with lashing of fake blood, thankfully I was wrong on all counts. With the exception of the scene where the police try to trace a phone call on a non-computerised telephone exchange it didn't seem that dated.Set in a Sorority house as college breaks up for Christmas and the girls prepare to go home. They start to receive a series of obscene phone calls and one of them disappears; the viewer knows that she has been killed by an unseen killer and dragged up to the house's attic. The police aren't interested at first believing she probably just went off with a boy. Eventually they take an interest but they are looking in the wrong places and never thing to search the house itself; the only person to look into the attic is promptly killed and isn't missed as she was meant to be going away.As the phone calls continue the police start to suspect the boy friend of the girl receiving the calls as the caller knows personal things that were said in the privacy of the house. Only once the police have realised the caller is on another line in the house does anybody realise they are dealing with a psychotic killer rather than just a pervert with a telephone.Director Bob Clark did a great job keeping things tense and avoids the current clichés of giving the killer unnatural strength or supernatural abilities to survive anything. There is no back story explaining why he is killing people which makes him creepier than some better known movie killers who have a mythology spanning several films. He also avoided gratuitous sex and nudity so if you go into this expecting to see showering sorority girls you will be disappointed, if you just want a good solid thriller you should have a good time. The actresses did a good job, especially Olivia Hussey as Jess, the main girl in the story and Margot Kidder as Barb, a girl who likes a drink and has a rather dirty mind, her joke to the policeman about a new telephone exchange was hilarious and perfectly delivered.",Black Christmas

11,BA_Harrison,"It's good, but it's no 'Halloween'.",7,11 February 2007,"Canadian director Bob Clark's Black Christmas (1974) gets a lot of love these days from many horror fans who cite it as the inspiration for John Carpenter's classic, Halloween, and some even claim it to be the original slasher filmthe one that started the sub-genre that spawned not just Michael Myers but countless other masked maniacs. Whilst I am not in total agreement with them (Mario Bava's Bay Of Blood, for example, follows the body count style of the genre and was made in 1971), I do agree that this film must have been highly influential on Mr.Carpenter, who obviously modelled some of his film's scenes on Black Christmas's best moments (although Halloween is still the superior movie, in my humble opinion).Clark sets his seminal shocker in a sorority house during the Christmas holidays, where a group of young women are killed one by one by a crazy, ranting maniac who has also been scaring them with a series of sick telephone calls. Starring Keir Dullea, Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and cult movie favourite John Saxon, the film has no shortage of talent in the acting department, and Clark delivers quite a few stylish directorial flourishes that really help to crank up the tension.From the get go, Black Christmas introduces plot elements and visual techniques that were to become a staple of stalk 'n' slash movies for years to come: creepy POV shots; the careful framing of shots to reveal movement in the background; the killer's heavy breathing on the soundtrack; the final victim frantically fleeing from the maniac (after having discovered the mutilated bodies of her friends). We also get to see where When A Stranger Calls (1979) got its 'We've traced the call... it's coming from inside the house' moment fromthe exact same thing occurs in Black Christmas!Also particularly effective are the telephone calls made by the maniac; a mixture of unintelligible ranting, guttural moans, violent threats and crude obscenities, they are very unsettling and help convey exactly how demented the (unseen) murderer truly is. Another factor that adds to the creepy vibe of the film is the fact that we never get to find out who the killer is or why he is attacking these seemingly innocent girls. Even at the end, Clark gives nothing away about his identity. By not giving us any background details, or any motivation for his actions, he turns the killer into a 'bogeyman' (another idea borrowed by Carpenter for his movie).Unfortunately, there are also several things that let the film down slightly.Firstly, there is a lack of any really likable characters: Hussey's heroine is rather selfish, Kidder's character is a loud mouthed drunk, and Dullea plays a rather dull and obsessive pianist. Worst of all is the drunken house mother, a nasty woman who thankfully meets a suitably violent end. At least Carpenter had the good sense to make some of his victims a little more likable, thus actually making the audience give a damn about whether they lived or not.Clark also neglects to put in any real scares; creepiness the film has in spades, but genuine shocks are in short supply. And with the few deaths being rather bloodless, the 'yuck' factor is also kept fairly low (unless you find endless shots of a body with a plastic bag over its head particularly nauseating).Lastly, Clark tries to inject some humour into the proceedings, but fails spectacularly: Kidder's weak prank about fellatio is desperately unfunny and the drunken house mother's search for booze is truly cringe-worthy.Black Christmas is a film that all horror fans should see, since it helped to define a whole horror sub-genre, but to say it is better than Halloween is definitely going a step too far.",Black Christmas

14,BandSAboutMovies,Near perfect,10,20 December 2017,"Based on a series of Canadian murders and the urban legend of calls coming to a babysitter from within the house (also see When a Stranger Calls), Bob Clark and A. Roy Moore created what many feel is one of the precursors to the slasher film genre.Bedford is a small college town, complete with a sorority house filled with victims, err, characters. While they're celebrating at a holiday party, Jess (Olivia Hussey, who was told by her psychic to do this movie) gets a phone call from ""The Moaner,"" a crank caller who has been bothering the other sisters: Barb (Margot Kidder, Sisters), Phyllis (Andrea Martin, SCTV) and Clare (Lynne Griffin, Strange Brew). Barb is a real firecracker, provoking the caller, who tells the girls that he will kill them all.Clare goes upstairs to pack and is suffocated by plastic wrap by an unseen killer and placed on a rocking chair in the attic.The next day, Clare's dad comes to take her back home for Christmas. The girls and their housemother, Mrs. MacHenry (Marian Waldman, Phobia), are surprised, as they thought she already went home. While all that is going on, Jess tells her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea, 2001: A Space Odyssey) that she is getting an abortion. He argues with her but can't change her mind.Meanwhile, the police get involved after learning that another girl, Janice, has gone missing. Jess also tells Chris (Arthur Hindle, Porky's), Clare's boyfriend, that something is up.While everyone else joins police lieutenant Fuller (John Saxon!) to search for the missing girls, Mrs. Mac is killed inside the house. Sadly, her life of hiding booze and yelling at everyone was cut short. As the girls return home, they find Jess' body and get another obscene call, which she reports to the police, who decide to bug the line so they can trace the calls. Then, Peter sneaks into the house for another argument.Black Christmas is unafraid of using holiday traditions to allow its killer to get away with murder. While carolers sing outside, Barb's screams go unheard as she is stabbed to death by a glass unicorn.Another phone call happens - one that quotes the argument Jess had with Peter. And while that's occurring, Phyl goes to check on Barb and is killed. Finally, Jess keeps the obscene caller on the line long enough for a trace, which reveals that the calls are coming from inside the house. She goes upstairs, armed with a fireplace poker, to get the rest of the girls, only to find their dead bodies. The killer chases her into the cellar and when Peter appears outside the window, she assumes that he is the killer and murders him with the poker.The police arrive to find Jess sitting with Peter's dead body. They're convinced that he is the killer, although they can't find Clare or Mrs. Mac's bodies. After she is sedated, the cops leave while one officer remains behind to wait for forensics. Then, we hear a voice whisper, ""Anges, it's me, Billy."" Jess' phone rings, which means her fate - and who the killer is - will remain a mystery.One of the most frightening parts of the film are the obscene phone calls, which were performed by Clark and actor Nick Mancuso (Under Siege), who stood on his head while recording to make his voice sound more insane. Mancuso would come back to record a ""Billy Commentary"" on the film, which is on the recent Scream Factory! release.Warner Brother studio executives hated the ending and demanding that Clark change the final scene to have Chris appear before Jess and say, ""Agnes, don't tell them what we did"" before murdering her. However, Clark stuck to his guns and kept the ending that he believed in. The studio further tinkered with the film, calling it Silent Night, Evil Night in its original release.When NBC aired the film as Stranger in the House on the January 28, 1978 edition of Saturday Night at the Movies, it gave stations the option of airing Doc Savage, as the Ted Bundy murders had just occurred two weeks earlier.There's an urban legend that this was Elvis' favorite horror movie. It definitely made an impression on Steve Martin, who told Olivia Hussey ""Oh my God, Olivia, you were in one of my all-time favorite films"" when she was being considered for Roxanne. She thought he meant Romeo and Juliet, but he told her that he meant Black Christmas, claiming that he had seen the film 27 times.There's another urban legend - how many can one film have - that says that Halloween was originally intended as a sequel to this movie.Clark would go on to direct Porky's and a film that failed at first before becoming a holiday tradition, 1983's A Christmas Story. Yep - he pretty much made both the happiest and darkest films about the Yuletide, which is pretty awesome.I love this movie. It's a true classic that's unafraid to go against conventions even as it creates them. Nearly every actor and actress in this movie went on to do more and play their roles perfectly here.",Black Christmas
15,Coventry,It's the season to be sadist...fallalalla lala la la!,8,25 July 2004,"Considering the time it was released, this 'Black Christmas' must be regarded as slightly more important than your average slasher in which gorgeous sorority babes are being exterminated. Black Christmas is a trendsetter, opening the gates for Michael Myerses and Jason Vorheeses who'll only be popular several years later. The plot is as simple as it ever wasbut here, it's new and even rather courageous! Lovely looking girls harassed by obscene phone calls and stalked by a familiar killer. Imaginatively timed around the holiday-season when the university babes are in a party mood and packing to spend Christmas with their families. Producer-director Bob Clark (who regretfully continued his career with horny adolescent crap like 'Porky's') uses many horror-clichés for the first time here: dumb cops, scream-queens, the isolated location of a fraternity house and the different stereotype-categories of female students. And  most of all  Black Christmas contains an old-fashioned scariness, still efficient even by today's horror standards. Finally, there still is room for comical undertones and good acting. The eminent John Saxon, but also the beautiful looking Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder (Lois Lane!!!) Horror fans can't afford themselves to skip this one. Black Christmas is a modest milestone in the field of scary cinema.",Black Christmas
16,Hey_Sweden,Top notch seasonal horror.,9,1 December 2011,"For those movie lovers who appreciate the subversive take of the horror genre on the Yuletide season, ""Black Christmas"" is one of the all time great Christmas themed chillers. Producer / director Bob Clark had already done the cult favourites ""Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things"" and ""Dead of Night"" (a.k.a. ""Deathdream""). He'd move away from the genre after this, but certainly ended this string of titles with one of the best and most memorable on his resume. Of course, he would return to Christmas fare almost a decade later with the much more upbeat ""A Christmas Story"".""Black Christmas"", written by Roy Moore, tells the story of a sorority house being menaced during the holidays by a stealthy and supremely creepy psycho, identified as ""Billy"". We never really learn much about him, and he's kept off screen or in shadow most of the time; the only part of him we ever clearly see is his eye. It remains to be seen if the few girls remaining in the house (most have left for their vacations) can survive the ordeal.It has naturally been mentioned many times how certain elements in this story would be popularized in subsequent movies like ""Halloween"" and ""When a Stranger Calls"". If one is already familiar with slasher movies before viewing this movie for the first time, they can hardly fail to notice that it won't play out in a way they're used to. The final girl in this case is nice enough but hardly ""innocent"". The atmosphere both in and outside the house is excellent (Carl Zittrer's music is a big help in this regard). Clark goes for a largely subtle approach, emphasizing the atmosphere and creepiness, utilizing a little bit of gore, but mostly going for a classic ""old dark house"" type of feeling.The sense of humour is a great asset, as well, with scene stealing Margot Kidder, as the vulgar sorority sister Barb (who also displays a touching vulnerability at one point) supplying much of it. Douglas McGrath as dim bulb police officer Sargeant Nash and Marian Waldman as secret drinking house mother Mrs. Mac are both a hoot. Lovely Olivia Hussey of ""Romeo & Juliet"" fame is leading character Jess, who already has her own problems to deal with, including her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea of ""2001: A Space Odyssey""), a temperamental musician. Andrea Martin is wonderfully appealing in a very straight-laced performance as her friend Phyl. And John Saxon has a great presence here as the compassionate and dedicated Lt. Fuller. Fans will also recognize actors such as Art Hindle (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" '78, ""The Brood""), Les Carlson (""Deranged"", ""Videodrome""), and Lynne Griffin (""Curtains"", ""Strange Brew"") in supporting roles.The movie builds slowly to a scary climax, which actually isn't quite as scary as the ultimate reveal right at the end, that plays out behind the closing credits. This helps to cement this movies' status as a horror classic. While it was a hit here in Canada in its time, it did take a while for its reputation to grow elsewhere. It's one of the movies I would easily recommend to new fans of the horror genre. 42 years later, it still works extremely well.Nine out of 10.",Black Christmas
17,preppy-3,Scares me again and again,10,26 December 2002,"The plot is simple--a crazy man hides in a mostly empty sorority house Christmas Eve.  He begins to stalk and kill the remaining girls.  This sounds like just another slasher thriller, but it's not.  For starters, it came out 4 years before ""Halloween"" started the slasher craze and it's an intelligent, very scary movie--how many slashers can you say that about? 
The film was shot in Canada on a low-budget.  With the exception of John Saxon, everybody was basically unknown (Margot Kidder made this before ""Superman"").  There's no sex, no nudity and very little blood and gore. Still, I've seen this movie at least 8 times and it scares me each and every time.  All during the movie, even when the characters are inside, you hear the wind blowing through the soundtrack.  It makes you feel the cold and chill the characters feel.  Also there are the obscene phone calls the girls in the sorority house are getting--they're deeply disturbing and the frightening music playing during them makes them worse.  A truly scary horror film--back in 1978 NBC cancelled a showing of the film--even edited they thought it was too disturbing to air!  That should tell you something.SPOILERSThe most terrifying moments in the movie--the phone calls (especially when you hear the killer pleading to be stopped);  when Olivia Hussey is grabbed by her hair; the opening murder and Margot Kidder's murder.Only complaint--the ending.  It was original back in 1974 but it's an overused cliche now.A definite must-see.  DON'T see it alone.

19,poolandrews,Horrendously overrated as far as I'm concerned.,5,28 December 2007,"Black Christmas is set in a girls sorority house around Christmas, one of the girls Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) is spending the festive season with her father at home but is brutally killed in her room before she meets up with him. The next morning & her dad (James Edmond) raises the alarm & contacts the police who organise a search where they find the dead body of a young child, meanwhile the sorority house has been receiving obscene phone calls which they tell the police about. Lieutenant Fuller (John Saxon) decides all the clues point the the sorority house with very good reason as there's a killer on the loose inside...This Canadian production was produced & directed by Bob Clark & I have to say I think Black Christmas is vastly overrated, considered by some to be the very first slasher film ever made I'd personally say it's more of a thriller although I can see why some would say that. The script by Ray Moore is very serious & tries to build tension up & remain quite taught but I have to say I was pretty bored by it. It takes ages to do anything & then we get the god awful ending, some people complain about horror films not having much of a story & Black Christmas would almost certainly give those people more ammunition as the killer is never seen, the killer's motives are never revealed neither is the basic question of who he is. I'm sorry but even Jason Voorhees & Freddy Kruger had back stories, at least they had some sort of motive no matter how flimsy it was while here in Black Christmas there is nothing. Some may like the ambiguity & sure it works well enough for most of the film but I'd have liked some sort of pay-off, some sort of explanation, some sort of twist, some sort of story behind the killer & a proper ending, you see Black Christmas doesn't so much as end as just stops. On the plus the plus side it's watchable, the character's are good & more human than in a lot of horror films although for me that's just not enough to want to sit through 100 minutes of this again.Since it was Chritsmas Day only a few days ago Black Christmas was an appropriate film to sit down & watch last night & director Clark does a really good job here & the films best asset is it's atmosphere & style, there are some great point-of-view shots from the killer's perspective & there's definitely a creepy chilly atmosphere to it. The film looks quite gritty & is far less glossy than the average Hollywood flick which helps it as well but despite some good visuals & a nice dark atmosphere I still didn't like the story & that's what really sinks Black Christmas for me. The body count is low & there's absolutely zero gore. Was it just me or did anyone else have problems understanding the obscene phone calls? I mean the guy speaking sounding like he was doing a bad Donald Duck impression! The ending doesn't work either on a factual level, the cops wouldn't leave Jessica alone in the house after what she had just gone through & considering what had just taken place they wouldn't have left the house anyway let alone not even bother searching the attic.Technically the film is well made & is pretty impressive, shot on location in Toronto, Ontario in Canada. The acting is fine, the likes of Kier Dullea, Ovlia Hussey, Margot Kidder & genre favourite John Saxon put in good performances.Black Christmas is considered by some to be the very first slasher film ever made which I can see why while other's claim it's the best slasher ever made which I can't agree with at all as I think it's one of the most overrated, I'm not saying it's a bad film by any stretch of the imagination it's just one that I personally didn't like & can't see why so many people do despite their reasoning. Remade by Hollywood as Black Christmas (2006) which I actually prefer as it has more of a story.",Black Christmas
20,Boba_Fett1138,A fine '70's genre movie.,8,8 August 2008,"It's not a movie with a great or original story (which horror movie does anyway?) or approach but this is simply one fine and effective genre movie, with a fine premise, good settings and some wonderful genre moments.Amazing thing is that director Bob Clark started his career with movies like this but soon continued on making movies such as ""Porky's"" and ""Baby Geniuses"", which is obviously a totally different genre. A waste of his talent? Well, in all honesty horror movies from the '70's are definitely better ones than the ones from the '80's of '90's, so I'm not too sure about it actually if Clark would had continued to direct horror movies during his later career those movies would had been as good as this one, mostly in terms of style.'70's movies of course have a very distinctive style and atmosphere. Some of the best and most classic horror movies also date back from the '70's. Movies such as ""The Exorcist"", ""The Omen"", ""Don't Look Now"", ""Halloween"" oh and I can just go on and on. This movie wasn't the first slasher and it also wasn't the most influential or best known one (credit for that still mostly goes to John Carpenter's ""Halloween"") but it's nevertheless obvious that this movie inspired later film-makers and is a fine example of the genre from the '70's.It's a really effective horror movie, that features all of the right required ingredients. It doesn't make this the most original genre movie with its style or approach but it's simply one fine executed one. The movie has a good dark and mysterious atmosphere and it also really knows to be scary in parts. Especially the phone calls within the movie, which play a key part, are really scary. I don't know what it is but phone calls are always scary and effective material for horror movies. Just think about movies such as ""Scream"", ""When a Stranger Calls"" or ""Sorry, Wrong Number"".What also helps the movie is its atmospheric musical score from Carl Zittrer, who used to work a lot with Bob Clark during his career.The movie also really has a great cast with actors you wouldn't necessarily normally expect in a genre movie such as this one. Margot Kidder is really great in this movie, in a fairly early role from her. The movie also stars Keir Dullea, who unfortunately doesn't ever star in that many movies.A great movie for the fans of the genre, as well as to everyone else for all that matter.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Black Christmas
21,view_and_review,Come Watch All Ye Faithful,8,22 October 2019,"A sorority house is being terrorized by obscene and disturbing phone calls. Little do they know the phone calls are only the tip of the iceberg. A mysterious and unknown killer is lurking in and around their house killing them one-by-one.This horror/thriller gets more intense as it goes and it gets bonus points for addressing contemporary issues. You have to wonder if this movie was attacking conservative Christian values or just trying to elicit shock and awe.It's Christmas time and folks are being murdered. The main setting is a sorority house where there is drinking, cussing, and an open assault upon the idea of virginity (Barb (Margot Kidder) labeled one of the girls a ""professional virgin"" LOL). Then there is the main character.Jess (Olivia Hussey, who reminds me of Kelly Macdonald (Margaret Thompson in Boardwalk Empire)), is in a committed relationship and she reveals to her boyfriend that she's pregnant and she doesn't want to keep the baby. That is a touchy topic in 2019 so I can only imagine how sensitive and risqué this must have been in 1974.Furthermore, when her beau insists that they get married and keep the baby, she stiff arms him saying that she doesn't want to marry him and she still doesn't want the baby. She doesn't do any of this in an aggressive feminazi way. She is very rational about the whole matter and not the least bit condescending.For such a delicate matter they covered it well. The dichotomy was on full display as she was never seen without a cross pendant around her neck and she was the only one seen enjoying the Christmas carol ""O Come All Ye Faithful."" In other words, her Christianity was not to be doubted yet marriage was a no and abortion was a yes. But the implication wasn't that marriage would always be a no and abortion would always be a yes. Just at that time in her life it was.As deep and even complicated as this was, this was a side story however while the main story was a maniac killing sorority girls. The main plot thickened and thickened as the police got involved and tried to tighten the dragnet around the killer.I think the movie was well done overall. It clearly wasn't a big budget film, yet they had very good actors and a good screenplay. I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, how it unfolded and how it played out.",Black Christmas

View on the film:Becoming Elvis's favourite horror,the level of care (un- credited) co-writer/(with Roy Moore) director Bob Clark & cinematographer Reginald H. Morris put in,allow this to remain The King of the Slasher genre.Opening in the middle of a holiday party,the screenplay by Clark and Moore impressively alters the image of the pretty young gang with impressive layers of maturity,as Jess goes to the cops to unmask the identity of the caller,and the initial sweet romance image is changed to a frank,adult discussion on abortion (with the writers breaking a big taboo at the time by letting Jess have a free-choice.)Along with the tough personal dramas they each face,the writers unwrap winning Slasher cuts,via each call building anticipation to the next appearance of the stranger, an eerie passage of time between the incredibly macabre killings,that give the final an unpredictable,nail-biting chill.Wisely keeping the identity of the killer vague, (three people dubbed the ""voice"") Clark and Reginald H. Morris build on the stylisation of the Giallo, via smoothly handled,extended first- person tracking shots that slither in the background of the house,and an ending (which Clark had to fight for) which covers the winters tale in a haunted,ghostly atmosphere,of the mystery being unfinished.Backed by the spine-tingling score of Carl Zitter (who got the sound by playing the strings of his piano with forks, combs, and knives!) Clark melts the snow away with a jet-black comedic strike,as the pile of bodies look out on the Christmas scenery.Only working for the first week of production, (with clever editing making him appear more prominent) Keir Dullea hits icy notes of doubt as Jess's boyfriend Peter,and Margot Kidder pours merry cheer as Jess's close friend Babs.Advised by a psychic to take the role (!) the elegant Olivia Hussey gives an excellent performance as Jess,thanks to Hussey bringing across Jess's thoughtful, rational solutions to closing the book on this bloody Christmas carol.",Black Christmas

This version is dull by comparison, particularly the first half, but it picks up steam in the second. And the open-ended climax is interesting.But I strongly prefer the female cast in the remake; they're just all-around superior IMHO. Of course Olivia Hussey is attractive in this rendition, albeit cold, and Lynne Griffin as Clare is winsome, although her part is small. Andrea Martin (Phyl) comes across as a shorter version of Cher with short, curly hair. Unfortunately, Margot Kidder as Barb is one of the most obnoxious characters in cinema, a real turn-off (so is Mrs. Mac, but less so). Thankfully, Barb's only prominent through the first half.The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in Toronto.GRADE: C+/B-",Black Christmas
27,trashgang,the start of the slasher genre. ***spoiler alert***,8,21 January 2021,"Black Christmas, almost 50 years old and even as you see it nowadays in 2021 it sometimes gives you the creeps. Not that it is scary but the telephone calls are never explained and the way the caller talks, well, that gives you goosebumps. Some do say that Blood Feast (1963) started it all but for me this one comes closer to the typical slasher items.It must have been the first time that POV is used from the killer's point. The breathing does give it a more scary part. A thing used a few years later in Halloween (1978) and in Friday The 13th (1980).Nothing is explained, who is the killer? Why does he kill? Motives? And some shots are just so eerie that they used it a lot in the flicks to come. The close-up of the eye, classic. The intruder, classic. A holiday as theme, classic. The obnly thing slashers added was the gratuitous nudity.It never had the intention to start a new genre but it did. Okay, here and there it isn't up to date anymore but hey, 50 years remember! If you want to see were it all started this is the one. Sadly, some don't like it, no in your face or on-camera killings, but remember, Halloween didn't had any blood at all throughout the flick.I'm sure when you are watching the flicks from the slasher heydays you will remember alot from Black Christmas.

28,mm-39,Average,6,25 August 2003,"Spoiler...  They say this film influenced others; well it is average by today's standards.  This film builds great tension but is dated and laps over periods of time.  The relentless tension build up is what makes this movie.  The scare factor is very tame, and predictable for today's standards.  Plot twists, this is before call trace and shows the age of this film, where they have to wait to trace the caller and find out he is calling from the house. I could see this one coming right from the get go.  The comic relief is awful, the 70's must have been the I don't care rude and crude generation that reflects today's social decay.  The swearing, perverseness, drinking, and rude comments had a shock humor element then, but in today's Jenny Jones, Jerry Springer society make one's eyes roll.  It seems in that era of filming everyone has to yell, for many of us who work customer service just find it idiotic, not funny, or even amusing. (explains why so many disgruntled customers have the 70's styled mustaches, leather vests and boots). I work at the Post Office and see this daily, and with my experiences with unbalanced people I find the caller's messages scary.  They must have experience with these phone calls or studied mental illnesses. The caller rants, rambles, repeats himself, and goes on a senseless tangent. A different sense of reality.  Everyone in this film has a problem, the drinking bit is too much, and builds little character development.  The unbalanced boyfriend ending, and the cops too stupid to check the rest of the house is a little too much. 6/10",Black Christmas

Not a lot of blood but one fantastic and surely heavily influential stabbing with blood and crystal and glass and nail varnish combining in a truly ecstatic few seconds.

They also remade the movie and I was curious to see the original first before I saw the remake, the strange thing is when I watched this movie, it sent chills down my spine. Normally most horror movies don't do that, it'll get you scared, but don't get to you like Black Christmas did, this movie just gave me everything I could want from a horror film. Those calls were just so beyond creepy, the voice, you knew what was coming to these girls for the holidays and it wasn't going to be peace on Earth. My only problem with this movie... ""Whatever you do... DON'T GO UP THOSE STAIRS!"" said by a policeman, what does the girl do? Oh, she goes upstairs, but I guess we wouldn't have a movie if she did the sensible thing.Some sorority girls are spending their Christmas vacation at the house and are just going to enjoy the holidays together. But after some disturbing phone calls with men heavily breathing, making foul sexual suggestions, and even involving blood curdling screams, the girls have a bit of a scare when the mysterious stranger won't stop calling. Something else has happened, one of the sisters has gone missing, when the girls along with some of their friends try to figure out how these calls and the disappearances of other sorority sisters, the might not want to know where the call is coming from.Black Christmas is a classic and should definitely be watched in the dark, this movie just had me scared and wanting more. It makes you wanna just stay in your room and unplug the phone, we all get prank phone calls at least once, but this is our worst nightmare is when those calls are just more than a mear threat. Olivia Hussy was a great selection, I've only seen her in Romeo and Juliet and the TV mini series IT, I didn't know as a teen she could be so great for a horror movie. Like I said there are some cliché's that I was a little angry with, but this movie does deliver some good scares and will not disappoint you, it's a true sleepover classic.8/10",Black Christmas

Many of the scenes were creepy as the darkness and shadows of what's around the corner made the film work so well! Directed by Bob Clark(of ""Porky's"" and a ""Christmas Story"" fame) his very early work before he became famous with comedy movies, paints a somewhat dim and cold take on the Christmas holiday.The setting is at a university just before the holiday break and the story involves a group of sorority girls who gather at their pledge house for one last party before Christmas break. All of a sudden things change and go dark as one of the girls go missing. And to add suspense and complicate things strange and obscene phone calls start to happen(oh that voice was just so creepy and strange!) Really this film is a cult slasher classic that helped spark the genre. Many of the film's murder scenes are filled with blood and gore as the plot twist towards the end of the film before finding out the killers identity. Also look for Margot Kidder and John Saxon overall really this is a slasher classic that any horror fan or film buff should see.",Black Christmas
33,Red-Barracuda,A fairly unheralded true classic of the horror genre,10,1 August 2017,"Halloween (1978) is often credited for kick-starting the slasher film craze that went into hyper-drive after the subsequent success of Friday the 13th (1980). But it could be reasonably argued that there were much earlier films which could more accurately be said to have laid the groundwork for this sub-genre such as several Italian gialli such as Mario Bava's Bay of Blood (1971) or Sergio Martino's Torso (1973). But it should also not be forgotten that the Canadian film Black Christmas touched on many of the ideas that would become slasher clichés in later years and should most certainly be considered a hugely influential and significant work. For my money, this one tops all of the aforementioned movies and remains one of the absolute classics of the horror genre. Set during the Christmas holidays, a psychopath surreptitiously enters a sorority house and hides out in the attic; from here he commits a series of brutal murders.This one scores in that it manages to combine what was a pretty original horror concept in 1974 within the framework of a story populated with well-rounded characters and a sense of realism. The cast is great and all do fine work here. We have a commendably serious performance from Olivia Hussey as the main protagonist, better still is Margot Kidder in a scene stealing role as the constantly drunk live-wire Barb, Marion Waldman puts in an amusing turn as the alcoholic dorm lady, Doug McGrath is very funny as the idiotic inept cop at the station, genre favourite John Saxon is great as ever as the police captain and Keir Dullea is suitably odd as the slightly unhinged music student boyfriend of Hussey's character. This type of top drawer talent and properly thought-out characters are very welcome in a sub-genre which would go on to be synonymous with paper thin characters who were little more than cannon fodder for a maniac. In Black Christmas we have an actually rather disturbing killer who is even more frightening in that he stores the bodies of his victims in the attic totally unbeknownst to any of the other characters. He also indulges in some highly creepy obscene phone calls to the girls in the house – these were practically as disturbing as any of his acts of murder. In fairness, the film is not overtly violent and much of its fear factor comes from the more psychological end of the spectrum.In amongst all this is another surprise – humour that is genuinely amusing. The scene where Saxon confronts McGraths dozy cop about the questionable name of the sorority house he had witlessly taken down is comedy gold. Director Bob Clark's previous film, the quirky zombie film Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things (1972), was far more directly about eliciting laughs but it sort of failed to be scary at all. With Black Christmas he delivered a far superior product and truly directs this one with great skill. The festive atmosphere really works in this one's favour too with the snowy Christmas background adding a lot of additional atmosphere. This is also a film which is not afraid to ultimately hold back information and never feels the need to explain absolutely everything. This mystery which can never be fully explained adds additional intrigue to proceedings and ultimately winds up with a rather bleak, yet very effective ending. In summary, Black Christmas is a genuine horror classic and a film so well made that it rewards repeat viewings.",Black Christmas
34,disdressed12,"not scary, but disturbing and entertaining movie",6,15 October 2006,"after watching black Christmas,i have to say it wasn't scary,so much as disturbing.sort of along the line of the original when a stranger calls,except in a sorority house.in fact when a stranger calls came out five years later and almost certainly borrowed its premise from black Christmas,though it was less entertaining and not as well done.black Christmas also had some humour in it,mainly in the form of the sorority house mother mrs mac,played by marian waldman,who had more than a bit of a drinking problem and was very liberal in her use of questionable language.also providing some humour was margot kidder, who played barbi,one of the sorority sisters.the characters in black Christmas were not as developed as they could have been,but from what we are shown of them,they are likable.this movie was entertaining, though as i said not,scary and not overly suspenseful.in fact it could have worked equally well as simply a drama.there is some very course language in the form of the psychopath,so if you are easily offended by very foul language,you won't like this movie.otherwise you could do a lot worse with your time .if you enjoy or have enjoyed black Christmas, then you should check out the 2006 remake of when a stranger calls,which is far superior to the original.as for black Christmas, 6* out of 10",Black Christmas
35,sddavis63,"Very Good Early Example Of The ""Slasher"" Genre",7,3 December 2011,"It would be an exaggeration to suggest that ""Black Christmas"" gave birth to the slasher genre. It is, however, without any doubt one of the best of the early examples of the genre, and it's very obvious that it provided at least some inspiration to what I would still consider to be the absolute best of the genre - John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" which came out a few years later. Carpenter (at least in his first Halloween film) learned a lesson from ""Black Christmas"" that a lot of later slasher films forgot - the ""horror"" isn't in blood and gore and overly and unnecessarily graphic violence, and you don't need naked young women to keep people watching! There are no naked young women in this (although there's sexual content in the phone calls) and ""Black Christmas"" actually contains surprisingly little blood and gore. Really there's only one scene - the only murder that's actually depicted, and certainly by modern standards it's not particularly graphic. The film creates its horror and suspense through the use of atmosphere and setting - and by letting the viewers in on what's happening from the start. We may not know who the killer is, but we know that the killer is in the house - which makes this all the more suspenseful, because at literally any moment of any scene set in the house, something could happen. That really very little does happen only heightens the expectation.The story revolves around a sorority house just before Christmas. As the movie opens, while a party is going on inside, a stranger (whom we never see) climbs the side of the house and gets into the attic. We're than introduced to the fact that the girls in the house have been getting a series of creepy obscene phone calls. The story builds from there as the first girl is killed, and while it takes a while for anyone else to die, that sets the stage for a truly creepy movie watching experience. The ambiguous open ending also provided obvious inspiration for later similar films that left similar open and ambiguous endings, but perhaps kept returning to the well too often.The cast is pretty decent. Apparently the producers tried to recruit some pretty big name people for this (I understand, for example, that Bette Davis was approached to play the role of the house mother) but couldn't get them. In the end, we got early film appearances from people who became fairly recognizable in later years, especially Margot Kidder, who played the drunken Barb. This is certainly deserving of recognition as an influential film that helped in the rise of a genre that has sadly now often chosen to focus on blood and gore more than story.

36,lost-in-limbo,Horrific greetings!,9,18 March 2006,"A group of sorority girls are preparing themselves for the holiday season, but there festival spirits are short lived when suddenly they're plagued by a prude caller making obscene comments and later the next morning one of the girls have gone missing. Worried about the girl, her father and her friends go to the police for help and the detective involved discovers that maybe the girls' disappearance, a murder of a child and that of the obscene phone calls share a common interest.I remember when I use to think that Halloween was the begin all and end all of slashers and even to a extend horror films. Though, that was up until I discovered this Canadian little gem. Well, this has got to be one of my favourite horror films I've come across and I finally got around to updating my video copy to that of DVD. It's one of a few horror flicks that still are able to raise goosebumps whenever I watch it.Simply this is an old-fashion horror tale working with atmospheric subtleness and conjuring up such a sombre mood, where it's exhausting in its slow-building suspense. You might think that it all sounds familiar and it sure does, as you could class this as a blueprint for the slasher genre. Yes, before 'Halloween' was even thought up this film was setting up the trend to come, just that 'Halloween' was advertised better than 'Black Christmas' and from that pick up momentum in its popularity. It was one of the first films to cook up these standard clichés and stereotypes you find in these movies. But when compared with most in its field this story will rather deal with atmosphere than violence, and that didn't bother me because director Bob Clark did a sensational job in keeping this slow-burner genuinely gripping with many effectively memorable scenes. The violence is rather timid and implied with little blood, therefore it goes for a psychological imprint by leaving in up to your imagination to picture what happened off screen, although there are two deaths we do see, which stand out in a very stylistic manner. Actually a lot of things are left up in the air, leaving you to use your own insight to come up with the answers and images. Sometimes the uncertainty of the outlook can work against you, but here it seems to fit in neatly. I thought the whole ambiguity of our killer (we don't even see him and there's no motive) and that of the ending goes down well, but it's one of those ones you'll like or be totally disappointed with.The customary plot focus basically that of a few collage students where we learn some elements (the abortion issue) that drive the motivation factor that's formed around its murder-mystery tone. I really wouldn't say it's a straight-forward stalk and slash film, because the mystery of the disappearance, murders and the obscene phone calls seem to level out instead of focusing on one particular aspect. This helped woven a nice dose of reality to the situation and characters. Now what does take front stage, are definitely the blood-curdling phones in a perversely harassing manner. The jittery voice(s) and the lurid context being said over the phone are intensely unnerving. It might build on its high-strung suspense, but the in the script there's a nice amount of amusing dark humour that's worked in with great timing. The character's interactions and perks are believable and the chemistry amongst them was more than sound. The performances were great (there's no bad exceptions) with each one fitting their roles perfectly. I would even go to say that there wasn't a weak character in the main leads, as they all had their own complexities and contain strong personalities. Margot Kidder stands out as alcoholic lout Barbie and you've got the also impressive John Saxon as the more than competent Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller. Olivia Hussey is gorgeous as the concerned, but strong-willed Jessica and Keir Dullea nails down her irrational boyfriend Peter.Director Clark draws tightly such a dreaded mood with the wintry backdrop and within that of the almost empty and bleakly lit sorority house. The dark presence of this house just takes you out of your comfort zone with its hidden layers. There's prominent work in the camera placement that moves well with the sweeping shadows roaming the house and the POV shots are eerily staged to perfection with the constant heavy breathing backing it up. They provide some quite inventive shots, as there's a lot of movement going on in the panning and frame shots. The chilling but underplayed piano score knows when to make the sudden whispers turn into quick rush of terror and the sound effects played a big part by chiming with preciseness to make you feel hellishly uneasy. Even when it's dead silent with only the ruffling winds it still succeeds in stamping a terrifying mark. It's clearly a dynamic catalyst of the genre! A truly stark and quite stylish horror film that gets under your skin by suffocating you with a heavy blanket of menace. Highly recommended!",Black Christmas
37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"I'm dreaming of a... well, it's a nightmare, actually.",7,30 December 2020,"Considered by many to be the first true 'slasher' (although 'Peeping Tom (1960)', 'Psycho (1960)', 'A Bay Of Blood (1971)' and 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)' preceded it), 'Black Christmas (1974)' certainly provided plenty of inspiration for genre filmmakers (including John Carpenter) in the years following its release. For the most part, the movie plays out as a mystery with elements of a psychological thriller. It sees the members of a sorority house harassed with obscene phone calls and picked off one by one by an unseen killer. The film is really good at getting you to engage with its enigma, trying to guess who the killer may be while wondering when he is going to strike again. This is a large part of why the picture is as successful as it is, even if it is relatively slow between its more intense sequences. It's genuinely rather suspenseful at times and its madman's maniacal screaming is actually somewhat upsetting. It all builds to a brilliantly ambiguous finale that really does get under your skin, leaving you craving closure and callously refusing to provide even an ounce of it. It's a fantastic way to end the experience. Overall, the movie is engaging and typically entertaining. Its restrained use of violence is surprisingly effective and one of its most shocking images - a manic eye peering out from the shadows - is still burned in my memory. It's a rock-solid early entry in its genre. 7/10",Black Christmas
38,dromasca,horror Christmas,7,29 December 2013,"Here is a film that is not usually present in Christmas day-time programs although its action happens around Christmas and has even a scene with a choir of children singing carols. Filmed in 1974 in Canada Black Christmas is a combination of seasonal movies and horror, more precisely one of the first films of the 'slash' sub-genre.Film director Bob Clark is author and this is one of the first in a career that will still includes some successes of the genre, and even a second film (A Christmas Story) with the theme of Christmas. Clark demonstrates that by 1974 he already mastered many of the secrets of the trade and assimilated the lessons of the masters of the previous generations and especially Hitchcock. The film takes place in one of those American sorority houses. Thrill is induced at the beginning by mysterious and threatening phone calls, because shortly afterward the home tenants begin to disappear one by one, and the bodies to accumulate. I will not tell more so that I do not take away the pleasure of watching for those who still are interested to see the film.'Black Christmas' deserves to be viewed primarily by enthusiasts of the genre, but not only them. I can not say it is a film that time has not made ​​its mark , but interestingly good as its parts are now more visible. At launch it was almost 'destroyed' by some critics, for example that of New York Times. Although some of the critic's objections are deserved (acting seemed pretty sketchy to me), I believe he lost sight of the exact build-up of the atmosphere, using the enclosed space to create the feeling of claustrophobia and daring approach to social topics such as the right of women to decide about abortion (in general it can be said that this is a feminist film). Of course, the 1974-75 critic could not have anticipated that the film will open the way to other horror films that take place in the student environment such as the series 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' . But there are at least two scenes close to masterpiece that he should not have missed. In one of them a girl's father and the mother of another girl - both disappeared - search their daughters at night in a frozen park. A body is found. To whom it belongs? The whole scene is rendered in its profound horror just filming two parents, there not need to see any body to understand whose death has been confirmed. Groovy and psychologically excellent. The second great scene is the final and I will not tell anything about it, so that I do not deprive anybody of the pleasure of a viewing which I recommend.",Black Christmas

The atmosphere is creepy and builds tension, the characters are developed, there is even a marginal attempt at humor, but ultimately I was disappointed. My biggest objection is the unresolved ending. I realize this begs for a sequel, but the story is so simple, that a second film really has nowhere to go. Another problem is the movie is very claustrophobic, with the camera constantly tracking the unseen killer throughout the sorority house. John Saxon seems wasted and his screen time insufficient. ""Black Christmas"" would make a superior short, but at 98 minutes, it is way too long for such slight material. - MERK",Black Christmas
43,TheMovieDiorama,"Black Christmas decorates traditional festivities with blood, suffocation and disturbing phone calls.",7,21 December 2019,"Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! And have a slashin' good time! The slasher sub-genre was most proficient during the mid-to-late 70s, with 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Halloween' and a plethora of spicy Argento features to add a worldly aesthetic. However, one film that innovated the tropes and traits commonly found in the aforementioned titles, was Bob Clark's Black Christmas. A horror ""slasher"" (if you can classify it as that...) where an anonymous serial killer remains secluded in a sorority house, gradually picking off the girls one by one. Just in time for Santa to come down that warmly lit chimney and deliver them coffins wrapped up in cute little bows.To say that Black Christmas was revolutionary and a blooded sprout for the blossoming sub-genre to come, would be an understatement. A nameless unknown killer that exhumes mental instability? Check. An expendable cast of characters that stupidly investigate ominous sounds by themselves? Check. Excruciating tension with every camera movement? Absolutely! Surprisingly, now that I've witnessed various films during the conception of a horror movement, it's incredibly easy to see how influential Black Christmas is. Not for its innovative concept, as other simpler thrillers utilise slashing techniques with efficiency ('Psycho'), but rather for its technical proficiency.Clark's direction, whilst unpolished, is solid throughout. Taut camera pans to explore the darkened hallways of the sorority house. Minimal sound editing to heighten the suspense. Excellent use of shadows to illustrate the antagonist's anonymity. Sublime POV perspective to place the viewer in the shoes of the killer. And a ramped up conclusive act that will have anyone watching perched on the edge of their seats eagerly anticipating to unwrap the plot twist, even if that narrative turn was predictable from the offset. The camera can be visible on specific occasions, mostly through reflections in picture frames as it glides through hallways. Emphasising that unrefined quality of Clark's novice-like direction. It does give the feature some flavour, perhaps not the jolly festivities one was yearning for. More egg nog than champagne.Yet what really injected some holiday spirit into the story, were the characters. Uniquely all acquiring a distinguishable personality that made them different and relatable. The shady drunk friend or the intellectual gal who has all the common sense (that is until she goes wandering by herself...!). The point is, they were all memorable, and that's a rare achievement in slashers. The second act, where the campus police become involved, does stagnate the overall pace with minimal storytelling momentum. Fortunately the third act immediately picks it back up for an explosive bauble of...slashing.So despite the lack of actual slashing, overall unrefined quality and inconsistent pacing, it's an extremely enjoyable horror flick that takes a gentle holiday season and turns it into a crazy murder-sesh. Perhaps my new annual Christmas film? We'll see...! I am sadistic after all!",Black Christmas

46,BaronBl00d,Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,8,18 November 2005,"This is definitely one of the best of its type; a crazed killer stalks a coed in a sorority house and unmercifully butchers her closest friends and any passersby that just happen to get in his way. What separates this from the typical slasher fare is an above-average script, above-average acting, and really good direction. Director Bob Clark, the director of such films like Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things and Murder by Decree, seemingly does everything right in this one and makes all the right choices(well, most of the time at least). His flair for creating hauntingly eerie scenes that stay with you is first-rate. Take the first murdered girl(happens in first ten minutes). We never see the killer but just his eyes. The girl is saran-wrapped in a dress bag and set in a rocking chair with an old doll. Her presence is filmed in such a stark manner as to really set the mood of this whole film. Clark then effectively builds tension by the girl's father looking for her - as no body is found - the coed, played by the beautiful Olivia Hussey, consistently receiving phone calls from what is some sick sex pervert on the outside, the police are then brought into the mix, and finally some red herrings that throw the viewer off track a bit at the very least. All this goes on with snow, caroling, decorations, and Christmas atmosphere like one might expect in a small college town of a similar ilk. The first death scene is for my money the most effective shot and running scene in the entire film, but there are other equally brilliant shots that Clark uses to shock and create suspense. One scene in particular has Margot Kidder getting acquainted with the man with the creepy eyes with cuts(no pun intended) to children singing mellifluous carols at front door for Hussey. The acting all around is pretty good. Hussey is adequate. Kidder is too. Andrea Martin is along as well. The main policeman is John Saxon. He is pretty good and seems to flourish in roles like this in the seventies. Many films have tried to create the same effect as Black Christmas, but so few have come close at all to reaching the level of this - at least in this genre.

Black Christmas was a bit ahead of its time by using the subject of abortion as one of the main stories in the film. Also a lot of the killers movements are filmed in a point of view style. It was also a first horror film to have its villain use phone calls as a way to terrorize its victims. This movie also has an open ending without revealing or pondering much bah the killer. Also it is notable for ""the calls r coming from the house"" revelation. Now coming to the flaws, the movie is very slow paced. The editing n cinematography is  not upto the mark.

49,insomniac_rod,There ain't no room for Christmas miracles or presents.,10,14 May 2006,"""Black Christmas"" is an important movie for the Horror genre because it generates opinions of all kinds. People might love it or might not find the greatness about it. Many other people haven't even watched it. But something for sure is that the movie is one of the most important moments in Horror history. A killer on the loose terrorizes an all girl Sorority House with obscene/disturbing phone calls. Little do they know that the deranged killer is hiding in the attic. The believed prank calls take another twist when the caller threatens to death one of the girls. To make things worse, a local young girl is raped and murdered by a killer on the loose. Could it be that it's the same man that is making the calls? The first phone call presumes that a girl has been raped because the caller uses obscene language towards a girl's intimate parts and later makes sounds involving a choking. This all happens on Christmas eve! To make things worse, the hider manages to get down the attic and murder one of the sorority girls. This is where hell breaks loose. Then, one by one these girls and their housemother find terrible fates at the hands of the deranged intruder. The calls continue but each time get nastier and scarier. Police traces the calls and find the shocking truth: the calls are coming from inside the house. It seems that the housemother had two different lines in the house. One of the extensions was in the attic, where nobody would ever enter. The attic is filled with old, dusty toys and old furniture. Also, there are photographs that may be from the killer's family. It seems that the killer lived there before it was used as a Sorority House. The atmosphere surrounding Christmas is more than tense. First, the missing girl that later is found dead, then the missing sorority house girl that seems to have vanished from earth but nobody knows that her dead body is wrapped in plastic, sitting on a rocking chair in the attic!. The prime suspect is Peter, the boyfriend of one of the sorority girls. Many clues lead to believe that he's doing the phone calls but nothing is sure. Meanwhile people wonder what's going on, 7 people have been murdered by a mysterious lunatic. A series of events lead to a confrontation with Jesse and the hider from the attic (who's name is believed to be Billy). Will police come before Billy kills Jesse? How will things end in this mysterious situation? Who really is Billy? Watch ""Black Christmas""'s ending to make your own conclusions. Your brain will have a hard time trying to figure out a satisfactory conclusion. What a fantastic suspenseful, mysterious Horror movie this is. The events are displayed in a suspenseful way that increases the scare factor. There are very tense moments that carry the whole movie. The highlight is the infamous, classic moment of the ""eye in the closet"". That's one of the most frightening moments in Horror history; not because of what's visually displayed, but because what it means for the movie. Also, the phone calls are incredibly disturbing, nerve tensing, and can scare the audience without showing anything. The voices are chilling plus the obscene dialog and yells add more tension to the situations. This is a sui generis movie that has been copied over the years. The acting is perfect. Olivia Hussey delivers a believable, tender, strong, performance as Jesse. She knows really how to scream and how to deal with a maniac. I totally bought it. She was perfect enough to carry the whole film. Special mention for Margot Kidder as the drunk, rebel Babs. She was the comedic part of the movie. Too bad she found such a terrible fate. Keir Dullea plays really good his part as Peter, the paranoid but aggressive boyfriend. The man's acting is powerful. And John Saxon did his all time role perfectly. He can't do wrong. The rest of the cast is great. Marian Waldman and Andrea Martin play supporting roles at perfection. You really feel bad for the characters as you get to know them and generate feelings towards them. The death scenes are perfectly done. There's minimal gore but the scenes are very effective. The glass unicorn death scene is a classic scary moment. As many people know and recognize, BC set the standards for the slasher genre. John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is obviously inspired on BC. The killer's POV, the score, the Holiday setting, the situations, etc. Carpenter centered his movie on the killer, giving him a personality while Bob Clark used the killer as an element to increase the tense atmosphere. Black Christmas is a perfect Horror movie. First of all (and most important) it is scary, tense, suspenseful and dark. There ain't no room for Christmas miracles or presents. The killer is as menacing as you can get. Probably the most deranged villain on these kind of movies. I wanted though to know more about him but that's what makes this movie great: that you can figure out whatever you want. Your imagination may create a creepier situation that the real one. The ending is great. It leaves too much for your imagination and still is scary. Watch this gem and give it the credit that it deserves because it's one of the most important, influential Horror movies of all time. No room for Christmas songs or Santa Claus, ""Black Christmas"" will send up shivers up your funny bone. Believe all the hype towards it.",Black Christmas

Not only is it the earlier slasher movie, but it also gives birth to ""When a Stranger Calls"" a few years later. This is one movie, no one needs to forget.

53,FiendishDramaturgy,Highly overrated.,3,5 February 2004,"Yet another overrated but this time decent little serial killer flick surrounding girls in a sorority. Margot Kidder is great and this production features ""Audra"" from Stephen King's made For TV movie, ""IT."" While this is somewhat entertaining, the direction was horrible, and it is easily one of the most clichéd horrors I've seen.It was not scary, and while it tries to build suspense, the liquor-filled sorority house mother relieved any suspense built, by her antics. There are some really creepy (and humorous) elements in this one, making it better than some, but frankly, I don't see why this film is considered to be a benchmark of the horror genre. It really is not anything special. It is just a mediocre thriller, nothing more. I honestly thought Scream was better. *LOL*3.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Black Christmas
54,hellraiser7,"Silent Night, Deadly Night",10,2 January 2013,"Chirstmas time is my favorite season, it's hard to say why may'be because it something that brings togetherness which to me is it's true spirit. It's also a time where we believe we are the safest, however as an old saying goes s... happens, it doesn't matter what time of year it is. This is one of my favorite horror/Chirstmas films of all time if you can believe that.This film was not just one of the first slasher films but also one's set in a season. The fact that this was set up in the Christmas time was a risky move and I felt it was a good risk, who'd of thought Christmas in the horror genre could be a great combo. Let alone the fact this was the late great Bob Clark's first Christmas film where his second is of course my favorite Christmas film of all time ""A Christmas Story"" so two in a row isn't bad.The production value is great, it was made on a low or modest budget and I really felt they used it well and right. The setting was in a neighborhood and a Sorority House that looked like any house and neighborhood I'd pass by which gives the film a sense of familiarity; let alone most of the film takes place in the Sorority House.The cast is good Margot Kidder as Barb is a character you love to dislike because she is practically a dirtbag on wheels, but she just has some really funny spitfire lines. John Saxton is good as the level headed Lt. Fuller, tirelessly hunting down the elusive killer.But I mainly really like Olivia Hussey as Jess. This is one of those underrated actresses I really like (and on a sidenote ""Romeo and Juliet"" one of my favorite movies). I'll level with you sometimes I like actors and actresses that are under the radar a lot more than ones that are in the limelight way too long.Anyway back to the jist of things, the character Jess I really like she's good protagonist that is fraking gorgeous with the warm persona to boot, smart, has desires/ambitions, but most importantly is a person that can hold her own whether it be standing up to her blowhole boyfriend (Jess deserves someone better). I like that little drama with her character which made her sympathetic in my book, she has this dilemma and she chooses to deal with it a certain way but of course her boyfriend disagrees and is a complete dirtbag to her just spouting horsecrap to her. I'll admit at that moment I wanted to punch him and yell ""Frak You"" because I always believe a good significant other should always respect and understand the others feelings in certain matters no matter what. But most importantly hold her own physically against the killer.But what makes this film great and hold up is in it's suspense and creepy, moody atmosphere it invokes which I'll admit gave me the chills. The music is great I really like as the killer first enters there's some sort of eerie tone, as well as the end credit some of Silent Night which has a dark tone to it.I really like the plot it's a simple but it feels plausible, whose to say something like this can't happen; it also made me concerned as to how safe our secure our neighborhoods and homes are. Like in most suspense thriller has always been in being one step ahead of the protagonist. Throughout the film at the moments when nothing really happens yet, we always have that looming fact in our head that the killer in the house and up there, and he's about to do something any minute. In moments like that I'm always thinking ""Don't go up to that attic."" or ""Cmon get the frak out of house, don't spend another night."" We just constantly feel unsafe and hope the protagonist can find out this fact on time before it's too late.It's true we never really see what the killer looks like but this is a great think because this gives the killer the element of enigma, the crazed killer is simply who he is evil that's all we need to know. The cinematography is great I love the point of view shots which are great, where we are literally seeing the perspective of the killer. This really adds to the suspense because it adds to the step ahead element, from just some actions or even those noises he makes like in those creepy phone call scenes, it really gives you an idea how truly crazy and psychotic the antagonist is.And I like the feeling of isolation, from the fact most of this film takes place in the nighttime, the snow, the cold, and moments when a character or certain character is alone. Once again you feel unsafe because in times like that you know that the killer could possibly make his move and usually does. But it's also a time where all the chips are down for the protagonist and we hope he/she can successful fight back and survive.Black Christmas will make your skin crawl.Rating: 4 stars",Black Christmas

He also subjects them to multiple obscene 'phone calls, with much use if the c word, they really are quite shocking. Black Christmas really set the template for the slasher movie: sorority girls, high body count, red herrings, point of view shots, brutal murders, etc. Though
to be fair some of these elements were to be found in Italian giallo movies prior. Incredibly creepy and tense throughout, some humour is to be found in the antics of the drunken housemother and of one of the girls, who plays a funny prank at the police station.

At best, I'd say that this particular Horror film is only marginally better than the rest of the junk that's out there.And, yes, I know that Black Christmas can, in a sense, be considered the ""original"" Slasher flick, since it proceeds both Halloween and Friday The 13th by years - But I honestly don't give a damn about that sort of thing - 'Cause I still don't think it's all that good, anyways.And, besides that - I still can't figure out how the heck the psycho-killer was able to make those insane phone calls of his from the attic inside the Sorority House. Like, that would've meant that he would've had to have had his own private line up there. And I sure don't recall seeing this nut making any sort of arrangements about this special 'obscene-calls only' service with the phone company, or anything like that.And speaking about those ghastly, irksome phone calls in Black Christmas - According to Director Bob Clark - 5 people (both men and women) were apparently responsible for talking all that gross gibberish stuff over the phone, including Clark, himself. I think it's kind of interesting to note how little profanity was actually used in the things that this wacko said.And, in conclusion - I can't begin to tell you how glad I am that Black Christmas was not followed by a bloody sequel.

The movie features performances by Margot Kidder, Keir Dullea (2001: A Space Odyssey), Olivia Hussey (Romeo and Juliet), Andrea Martin (SCTV), and crusty cop John Savage. Although it provides a blueprint for many lesser films to follow, Black Christmas also succeeds because it never once explains why people are being killed. Nothing about motive or rationale, just plain old death. Well shot, too - there are numerous long tracking shots, of which I'm definitely a fan. Was almost called Silent Night, Evil Night because producers were worried people would think it was actually a blaxploitation movie.

First thing I'll say is these characters love to drink. There's a scene a woman brushes her teeth then gargles with liquor afterwards. This is still an extremely fun movie with some great kill scenes and intensity. The ending reminded me of ""When a Stranger Calls"" and makes the movie come together well. I loved the final fade out sequence too. This has an eerie feel throughout and a great conclusion. I strongly recommend watching this classic if you never have.

59,dee.reid,"Before ""Halloween,"" there was ""Black Christmas""...",10,25 October 2010,"Now this is what a slasher flick should be. Four years before the unprecedented success of John Carpenter's landmark American horror film ""Halloween"" in 1978, there was this little gem from Canada called ""Black Christmas,"" directed in 1974 by the late Bob Clark (""A Christmas Story,"" my #4 favorite film of all time and Clark's possible anti-thesis to this film), and was arguably the first true slasher film (1974 was also the same year that American filmmaker Tobe Hooper directed the landmark ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"").""Black Christmas"" is an expertly directed horror film, there's no question about that. The story is incredibly simple, yet stylishly executed. It's deliberately and excellently paced by Bob Clark, who skillfully injects the film with a wicked sense of dread from the get-go, undercut with some slickly timed dark humor (a lot of which is actually quite hilarious). Said humor is appropriately biting and deserves some well-placed laughs but unlike most movies to mix comedy and horror, ""Black Christmas"" doesn't sacrifice one for the other. In other words, what starts out as a serious thriller doesn't devolve into a mindless, gore-filled slapstick comedy (like ""Evil Dead II,"" which I love by the way). First and foremost, this is a horror film - a seriously effective and scary one at that.Upon having watched ""Black Christmas,"" there's no doubt in my mind that John Carpenter and company watched this film at least once (and took some very, very good notes) and it most definitely played a hand in influencing the directorial style of ""Halloween"" (although it's widely known that Alfred Hitchcock's landmark 1960 thriller ""Psycho"" had the most influence on ""Halloween""). (Even though I've never uncovered any information pertaining to this claim, anyone who watches ""Black Christmas"" and then re-watches ""Halloween"" will see some of the elements that undoubtedly influenced the latter film. I love ""Halloween,"" by the way, and having this information on-hand makes me appreciate both films even more as seriously scary horror flicks.)What makes ""Black Christmas"" such an important staple in the horror genre is that a lot of the slasher movie elements that most likely first appeared in this film were later used, and popularized, by ""Halloween"" just four years later down the road. Most importantly, is the fact that many times throughout the picture, the film is shown from the point-of-view of an unseen killer. We many times see his actions as he goes about the prowl for potential victims, in this case the residents of the Pi Kappa Sig sorority house. We also hear his breathes as he stalks the house sisters, and he is always that unseen-but-always-felt presence in the room, like something horrible is lurking just out of sight in the shadows.The women of the Pi Kappa Sig house are preparing to leave for the Christmas holidays, but a few - Jess (Olivia Hussey), Barb (Margot Kidder), Phyl (Andrea Martin), and house mother Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) - decide to stay behind. However, someone has been making obscene phone calls to the house and scaring the living daylights out of the women. And it isn't long before the unseen presence begins to systematically eliminate the women in some particularly gruesome and creative ways. It's up to the police, led by Lt. Fuller (John Saxon), to try to find this psycho before he kills anyone else.Even though ""Black Christmas"" does feature some particularly gruesome and shocking scenes of murder and mayhem, it actually contains very little gore (it's possible that it, like ""Halloween,"" took a few cues from ""Psycho""), the film still works largely through the power of suggestion - like what you don't see is far more terrifying because your mind allows you to fill in the gaps. Additionally, there's also a very low body count.It's entirely possible that Olivia Hussey was probably the original scream queen, although, like the actress has said herself in interviews included on the 2006 special edition DVD, she actually doesn't do any screaming in the movie. All the characters in this film are three-dimensional and likable, especially Margot Kidder's drunken party-girl Barb. She was probably my favorite character. Kidder, who is probably most famous in the cinematic world for her work as Lois Lane in the ""Superman"" series films - ""Superman II"" (1980) saw her at her best, in my opinion - gets some of this film's best lines and also provides some of the best comedic moments. This is another aspect of ""Black Christmas"" that I find so ingenious: to create so many likable characters so it's much more tragic when the Unseen Killer begins offing them. It's just a shame that its many, many like-minded imitators (or even its 2006 remake) over the years didn't follow the same pattern.""Black Christmas"" is a film that I've wanted to see for a long time. All the good things I've heard about it are true. This is one scary fright flick that helped give birth to a new sub-genre of horror, and later influenced ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th"" (1980) and my favorite slasher flick of all time, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984). It's also pretty funny, which admittedly, I was unprepared for, and made my appreciation for this film even greater. But make no mistake, the first order of business in ""Black Christmas"" is horror, and scaring the living daylights out of you, which it does in spades with suspense, easily identifiable and memorable characters (especially Margot Kidder - go, Margot!), Bob Clark's sharp direction, and minimal gore. So don't let its imitators fool you. ""Black Christmas"" is one holiday-themed horror film that has you re-thinking those yuletide celebrations.I dare you to watch it alone.10/10",Black Christmas

When one sister goes missing, local police don't give the case much thought until it's almost too late.Written and directed by Bob Clark (who would, amusingly, go on to direct the perennial holiday classic A Christmas Story almost a decade later), Black Christmas is an efficient, low budget proto-slasher with a nice blend of character moments, tension-breaking humor and moody suspense. Rather than observing in fist-balled terror from a distance, the audience takes a direct, active role in the murders thanks to an persistent hand-held, killer's-eye perspective during the bloodiest scenes. While an obvious gimmick, this approach does add a unique dimension to the screen and lends the killings an intimate, face-to-face quality that feels different to its many peers and imitators.The cast is surprisingly human and relatable for the genre, from the most experienced players (Margot Kidder as a wise-cracking, foul-mouthed lush) to the relative rookies (first-timer Lynne Griffin, whose last suffocated gasp is pictured on all the promo materials), and tackles a number of social taboos between all the stabbings.

""Black Christmas"" is a whodunit but with a twist ending that I find mildly dissatisfying.Much of the plot consists of routine chitchat and the comings and goings of the girls. So viewers will need to find one or more characters entertaining in some way to maintain interest in the plot. The elderly house mom who likes to sneak a drink from a cleverly hidden bottle provides comic relief. What these people don't know, but we viewers do, is that the killer is somewhere inside the large multistory house, watching and stalking them.Many scenes take place at night, and most are dimly lit, with spooky side lighting. The usual Christmas carols, peaceful and reassuring, are punctuated by the discordant sounds of piano strings that signal that the killer is nearby and/or active in some way. Adding to the tension and terror are sound effects, including the whistling of wind through the trees, footsteps of the killer, and his hesitant breathing. Several scenes are photographed from the killer's POV. Casting and acting are generally acceptable.The subplot about the outdoor search party seemed distracting and irrelevant to me; it could have been left out. Scenes at the police station also detract from the appropriately claustrophobic atmosphere of the sorority house.Despite an unsatisfying ending, the excellent color photography, music, and sound effects throughout the plot magnify suspense and mystery. Which renders ""Black Christmas"" a must-see for Horror genre viewers. And the film inaugurates a script formula that was so successful that it has been copied many times by other movies since this film first appeared some forty years ago, to render it a must-see for film historians.",Black Christmas
66,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Overlooked atmospheric horror classic,9,15 December 2015,"25 Days Of Christmas Cheer: Day 13Before John Carpenter's Halloween, there was Black Christmas, and no it's not a Tyler Perry holiday special. It's a slick little slasher set in a 1970's sorority house during Christmas break, when many of the girls have gone home. Suddenly mysterious phone calls start to plague the ones still there, and one by one a murderous, unseen prowler starts to murder them. The phone calls themselves aren't overly threatening, but instead sound like the nonsensical babbling of someone who is a couple reindeer short of a sleigh, making them all the scarier. I remember watching this years ago and being far more creeped out at the phone calls rather than the actual murders. That is a perfect example of using atmosphere to get under your audience's skin rather than straight up gore, and a testament to the fright films of the 70's and 80's, which really seemed to have all the atmosphere vs. gore dials in the right positions. This positively drips with tension and ambiance. The silences in between screams are almost deafening in their vacuous anticipation of terror to come, and strange as it sounds, there's actually a nice Christmas-y feeling in places where the fear hasn't yet struck, despite it being a horror movie. Olivia Hussey plays Jess, the main target of the killer with appropriate wide eyed intensity, Margot Kidder is briefly seen as the house mother, and horror regular John Saxon shows up as a suspicious Police Chief as well. I'd say this one achieves a state of suspense and atmosphere that can step up to the same plate as Halloween any day, it's just a little overlooked I suppose. The house they are in is the perfect setting, a sprawling Yuletide manor of creaky hallways, desolated basements, dark, dingy attic space and an uneasy thrum of awaiting gloom that gives the words Silent Night a new meaning. The poor girls just never know when a shrill telephone ring will slice through the eerie corridors, forcing them to answer it and hear an unnerving voice warble out ""It's me, Billy"" on the other end.

67,drownnnsoda,As Chilling And Somber As A Cold Winter's Night.,10,20 December 2006,"I watched this film during the holiday season a few years back, and have come to the conclusion that ""Black Christmas"" is a neglected classic, and (in my opinion) is the first and best slasher film ever made. Guaranteed, fans of John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" will love this film, some may find they love it even more than ""Halloween"". And even though I thought I'd never say that, after viewing ""Black Christmas"" a few times, I found myself enjoying it much more.""Black Christmas"" starts off with a Christmas party at a sorority house. While the festivities are taking place, a stranger is breaking into the attic upstairs, while the unknowing sorority sisters are enjoying themselves. The phone rings, and we are introduced to Jessica (Olivia Hussey), our main character. A strange person on the phone makes obscene comments, speaking in different voices while the sorority sisters listen in disgust. As the sisters flood out, all leaving to visit family and friends and whatnot, only a few are left at the sorority house, among them are - Jessica, Barb (Margot Kidder), and Phyl (Andrea Martin). Clare (Lynne Griffin), a fellow sorority sister, has gone missing, and Clare's father comes to investigate along with the help of law enforcement and her friends. The strange phone calls continue, and get more and more disturbing as time goes by, until Jessica is forced to call the police. Could it be her boyfriend, Peter (Keir Dullea), playing some sort of sick joke? Or is someone watching the helpless girls from within the house? As the holiday nears, the psychotic killer sets in motion his bloody agenda, while the local police try and track him down before more murders are committed.Before Bob Clark went on to direct the family holiday classic ""A Christmas Story"", he took a darker look at the holiday season with this hidden gem. ""Black Christmas"" is a masterpiece horror film, and surprisingly predates the classics by many years, such as ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th"", which get most of the credit for ""creating"" the slasher genre, when in fact this little Canadian chiller started it all. The plot was very original at the time, and contains some very scary moments - the scenes in the attic with the killer are among the scariest and strangest scenes I've ever watched, and the phone calls are flat out bizarre. The movie reeks a very dark, foreboding atmosphere (despite it taking place during the holidays) that never lets up throughout the film's entirety, as it slowly builds suspense before reaching the climax. It takes place during Christmastime, which honestly doesn't matter to the plot (it could've taken place at any time of the year), but the fact that it's set during such a joyous, festive season gives it a little more of a sinister quality, and makes it a perfect holiday horror movie.The acting in this film was excellent. Olivia Hussey is our lead, and she plays her character with vulnerability and innocence, putting the audience on her side the whole way. Margot Kidder plays the loudmouth, drunk sorority girl, and is also excellent in her performance, being a boisterous yet a likable character at the same time. Her character is probably the most memorable of the bunch. Andrea Martin plays Phyl, the quiet but friendly girl, and is also very good in her role. And Keir Dullea plays Jess's suspicious boyfriend well - the audience isn't sure if they should consider him a suspect or not, and he plays that perfectly. The rest of the cast includes numerous Canadian performers, all whom turn in convincing performances. There is even a little comedy thrown into the mix, an example being the alcoholic sorority housemother, Mrs. Mac., and her witty one-liners. The humor is subtle and is easily overlooked by the movie's grim demeanor, but it's in there for sure. The movie also contains some very creative death scenes (especially Barb's glass unicorn death, and the plastic attack in the closet), but even though these are present, it's really not a gory film, we mostly see the aftermath. The deaths aren't very bloody, tending to rely much more on sound, which is equally effective. One of the major things I admire about this movie is that the audience never knows who the killer is - he's kept a mystery, even at the shocking conclusion - the audience ever really gets a resolution and we aren't given any answers, something that I find to be very effective. I like the fact that we are given so little information on the villain, because it makes his presence much more terrifying. The tricky camera-work prevents us from ever seeing his face, in fact all we really see is his body shape, hair style, and his hands. We hear his voice though, as he harasses the sorority girls over the phone, muttering vulgar and disturbing phrases and making death threats (which were very well done, I might add). Even scarier, is the fact that he's hiding in the attic the entire time. This movie completely shatters the idea of feeling safe in your home... you can lock your doors and windows, but what if the killer is already inside the house, and you just don't know about it? Very scary concept. To sum things up, ""Black Christmas"" is an overlooked classic that deserves so much more recognition than it's gotten over the years - I'm sure any horror fan would love to find it in their stocking. Hopefully the upcoming remake will gain the original film some long-deserved attention. ""Black Christmas"" is the ultimate holiday-horror film for fans of the genre, and is the best slasher movie ever as far as I'm concerned. An underrated masterpiece. 10/10.",Black Christmas

But, with all of the similar films that I HAVE seen, although BLACK Christmas is obviously one of the originators, it's still like many of the other films I've seen in the slasher genre - and personally the 70's-80's slasher films are not among my favorite of the horror-genre overall. I prefer the more exploitative films of that time frame as opposed to the suspenseful horror films of the time - so my mid-grade rating of this film is based strictly on my own personal opinion...The long and short of this one is about a psycho that sneaks into a girls dorm and starts making obscene phone calls and picking off the ""tenents"" one-by-one. That's pretty much it.Not necessarily a bad premise - I've seen films work with a lot less, but like I said before, there's not much in BLACK Christmas that I haven't seen before. There is a noticeable lack of gore, which is another gripe of mine with the slasher films of this time-frame (yes, I'm one of those...) and the film dragged in a lot of places. Anyone who is into the classic slashers should definitely check this one out, but I personally just didn't find it as ""scary"" or enthralling as most others - sorry... 6/10",Black Christmas
70,JoeKarlosi,Black Christmas (1974) ***,7,10 February 2009,"The attic of a girl's sorority house during the holiday season becomes a nesting place for a grunting maniac, who scales the trellis one evening and begins to murder women amidst the snow and good cheer of Christmas carols. The madman uses the telephone to call the girls and taunts them with noises and deranged ramblings in a very unsettling manner. Olivia Hussey stars as the main innocent girl who is on the receiving end, with Margot Kidder as one of her no-nonsense loudmouth friends. The dependable John Saxon takes on the part of a police lieutenant who tries to help.The first thing I want to say about the film is that it's not unlike everything we've seen since in later slasher movies. Every cliché is present: the heavy-breathing psycho, the obscene phone calls; the terrified girl on the other end who is incredibly stupid; the grisly murder techniques; the killer's point of view shots... There is a sense of the familiar here, and I was almost prepared to give the movie a half-star less rating until I reminded myself .. this film came first, BEFORE all those other clones. Director Bob Clark has said that John Carpenter liked this film, and we can see some of its influence in Carpenter's HALLOWEEN, which often gets all the credit. But it's not the fault of the more rare BLACK Christmas that it spawned all the copycats which make it seem like one of them itself; I'd imagine this trend setter felt much more cutting edge in 1974, and that's why I gave it the extra boost it deserves. There is good and bad here ... I have yet to enjoy Margot Kidder in anything, and her drunken sleaze-mouth character here is annoying, as is the fat female den mom who's got a bottle of booze hidden everywhere in the house ... but not to worry. The killer, who's identity is a mystery, manages to be scary just through his eerie phone calls and creepy sounds. The idea of all this gruesome mayhem as a parallel to the joyous Christmas events happening on the side achieves the proper disturbing effect. The look of the large spooky house from the outside, complete with the image in the attic window, is haunting. The movie is not completely original, but it deserves extra credit for setting up so many now-patented and tried and true horror film clichés. *** out of ****",Black Christmas
71,fertilecelluloid,"Still a good movie, but not a horror classic",7,3 January 2006,"I enjoyed my first viewing of Bob Clark's ""Black Christmas"" more than my most recent viewing. I still feel that the film is an accomplished piece of work and established a structure and screen language that have been much imitated. The characters are intelligent and screenwriter Roy Moore even takes a shot at the abortion issue.The obscene phone calls made by the killer are truly obscene (much use of the word ""c**t""), and his psychotic rants are rather amusing, if not a little disturbing. The killer's POV, which opens the movie, is effective, and the image of a suffocated victim lurking by a window is a memorable one.The film doesn't scare me, though, or make me uneasy. Perhaps I've seen too many horror films. I can't fault Clark for his direction or Carl Zitter for his atmospheric score, more a soundscape than a traditionally structured series of compositions. I simply found the film a bit slow the last time around.Clark's ""Deathdream"" is one of my favorite horror films of all time (see my review), and it was made before ""Christmas"". Certainly, ""Christmas"" is a larger scale production, but, for me, it does not possess the intimacy of ""Deathdream"" and the sense of crawling horror. It plays more like a mystery than a horror film and lacks the tragedy that made ""Deathdream"" so effective. Bob Clark may have thought so, too, because ""Christmas""'s score sounds exactly like ""Deathdream"" (same composer), there is a creepy rocking chair (like the one ""Andy"" used in Deathdream""), and the house exteriors look like the house exteriors in, yes, you guessed it, ""Deathdream"".Still, a very good movie, but not, for me, a horror classic.",Black Christmas
72,ferbs54,Thank Heavens For Caller ID!!!!,7,24 October 2007,"Before I sat down to watch ""Black Christmas"" (1975) for the first time, director Bob Clark had been two for two with me. I had loved his previous two flicks--the zombie gut-muncher ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" and his living-dead Vietnam vet horror comedy ""Deathdream,"" both from 1972--and so was very stoked to see ""Black Christmas,"" a film with a great rep and a loving cult behind it. Now that I have finally seen the film, I'm aware of what this cult has known for decades: This movie, besides being highly influential, is also intelligently scripted, well acted by all, deliberately paced and, ultimately, extremely suspenseful. Concerning a psychopathic nutjob who not only makes obscene phone calls to a sorority house (possibly the creepiest phone calls in screen history; you'll be thanking heaven for modern-day ""caller ID""), but who also hides in the attic and does some occasional butchering, the film is the template for a raft of more famous slasher flicks that followed. Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin and especially the gorgeous Olivia Hussey (I just love the way she says ""Hello"") are all very fine, and John Saxon, here playing a police lieutenant, gets a chance to show how very appealing he can be when NOT playing coldhearted dirtbags. I must confess that the first time I watched this film, the open-ended finale left me a little annoyed (I guess I needed a bit more closure); I didn't mind this ending the second time I watched the picture, however, and even thought it kinda cool and freaky. To make things even better, the ""Special Edition"" DVD that I just watched comes with almost two hours' (!) worth of interviews, plus other features. It is truly a godsend for all members of the ""Black Christmas"" cult.",Black Christmas
73,aidanratesmovies,"Remade again and again, imitated one film after another, Black Christmas still holds its own",9,26 October 2020,"A provocative and well acted thriller, Black Christmas is not only original and well executed, but timelessly clever and quite fun to watch. I'll start with the films flaws, as there isn't much of them. I never found the film to be super entertaining in anyway, there are a few dull moments. However, it is very easy and engaging to watch, as the mystery at hands become more and more interesting as the film plays out. The film can be a bit tough to follow at times as well, as there are quite a few things going on at once, but perhaps the biggest flaw of the film is also something relatively small, that being the sound quality. Its irritating at times how loud it can be and how quiet it can be at other times. I'm not entirely sure if it is the quality of the film itself, or the film quality due to the streaming provider I watched it on, but a remastered version would be nice. Besides that, the film is quite smart. It isn't like other horror films at its time, not like the ones it is claimed to inspire. This is not a slasher film, contrary to what many believe, though it does serve as an inspiration for them. What this film has going for it though that other films that imitated it lacked, is the sense of psychological horror that it had going for it, and the unsureness of it all, which I always find quite brilliant. The cinematography is quite good, and very nostalgic, and the acting in it is quite good as well. Standouts for me would have to be first Margot Kidder as Barb, who provides an incredibly underrated performance, Olivia Hussey, John Saxon, Marian Waldman, and Keir Dullea. In the end, Black Christmas is a shining star among 70's horror, and despite it being nearly half a century old, it still remains to be frightening even today.
My Rating: 9.25/10",Black Christmas
74,Jonny_Numb,A Black Christmas Story,8,1 November 2007,"Bob Clark, whose life was cut short earlier this year by a freak accident, will always be a genre hero; after all, this is the man who gave us the controversial Vietnam-horror allegory ""Deathdream"" (1974), the playful Romero homage ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" (1972), and the celebrated holiday comedy, ""A Christmas Story"" (1983). ""Black Christmas,"" a seasonal slasher that predated ""Halloween"" by 4 years, establishes the formula with grace, subtlety, and skill, threaded with Clark's strong sense of small-town Americana (shots are composed with the biographical artistry of a Norman Rockwell painting). An obscene phone-caller is harassing the girls of a sorority house; one of the girls and the housemother (an inspired comic performance by Marian Waldman) go missing; and our protagonist, Jess (Olivia Hussey) is looking to get an abortion, much to the objection of her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea). Happy holidays, indeed! Roy Moore's screenplay takes a simple premise and lets the layers play out naturally--the collegiate and small-town humor still resonates today, and the characters are played with a minimum of exaggeration (as I said about the Clark-produced ""Deranged,"" we feel like we KNOW these people); my only complaint is that not all of the characters are well-integrated, and some disappear for long stretches at a time. Otherwise, we have some iconic figures that clearly influenced Carpenter's babysitters: Hussey as the Final Girl, Margot Kidder as the hard-drinking joker, and Andrea Martin as the straight- yet-slightly-gawky good girl. The legendary John Saxon is his usual excellent self as the local police captain. And Clark/Cronenberg regular Les Carlson (""Deranged,"" ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Videodrome"") has a small role that is the crux of most of the film's suspense (he's the phone-company employee tracking the source of the obscene calls through switchboards as high as the stacks at the Library of Congress). ""Black Christmas"" is one of the best slashers out there, and certainly one of the most influential (next to ""Psycho"")--raise some eyebrows at this year's holiday gathering by putting this on right after ""A Christmas Story"" (and vive la difference!).",Black Christmas
75,truemythmedia,Chilling Little Flick,7,10 December 2019,"It's easy to see and understand why Black Christmas has such a large cult following, not only is it an influential film (see 'Halloween') for the many slasher films to come, but it's also an exercise in minimalism, one of my favorite things about this film is the killer never gets a reveal, it could be anybody, anywhere, how long has it been since you've check the upstairs? It's a spine tingling thriller from a confident director at the top of his game, along side a great cast of scream queens, although they may not all be able to fully save the convienence laden script, there's just a few too many plot holes to make this a true stand out contender, but as a whole Black Christmas will satisfy those slasher cravings in an otherwise slasher-free holiday season.",Black Christmas
76,Reviews_of_the_Dead,A Start to Holiday Slashers,8,25 July 2019,"This film is one that I'll admit, I really did care for the first couple times that I've seen it. I don't want to make it sound like I hated the film, but it just wasn't one that really hit me. When I saw that it was playing at my local theater, I decided that I would check it out on the big screen to see if that altered my thoughts. The synopsis is during their Christmas break, a group of sorority girls are stalked by a stranger.We start out inside of a sorority house in college. Christmas is right around the corner and the winter break is starting. They're having a party and a good time going on inside. We then see someone stalking outside of the house. They climb up the side and enter into the attic through a window.Inside we see that one of the sisters, Barb (Margot Kidder), notices that the front door is open. She closes and goes back to the party. The other sisters are Jess (Olivia Hussey), Phyl (Andrea Martin) and Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin). Barb has a bit of a drinking problem. There's a phone call for her and it's her mother who scolds her for drinking too. She tells her that she can't do the original plans and invites her and her sisters to come skiing. Everyone agrees except for Clare. Barb and her do not get along as Clare is more reserved. She calls her out for being a virgin and Clare goes to her room.The phone then rings and they have been getting prank called by someone who does heavy breathing and says some inappropriate things. Barb calls the person out this time and he yells some things are her. The house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) then shows up. She has bottles of alcohol hidden throughout the house and takes drinks whenever she can, which is quite funny.Clare plays with the house cat in her room while packing and hears something in the closet. The crazy person is in there and he attacks her. He kills her with a plastic bag and pulls her up into the attic. It should be pointed out that he sets her up in a rocking chair with a baby in her arm right in front of a window. He rocks her as well as speaks with her, but we don't get a good look at him.Clare's father, Mr. Harrison (James Edmond) arrives the next day to collect her. She doesn't show up to where they're supposed to meet. He's not very happy with what he is seeing from her sorority sisters, Mrs. Mac or the place that she is living. He also says that he didn't send her to college to drink and be loose.Jess then goes to see her boyfriend, Peter (Keir Dullea). The night before she called him and he was short with her. He lives in a conservatory and he wants to be a concert pianist, so he doesn't get a lot of sleep as he practices a lot. He has a big performance later that day. Jess drops on him that she is pregnant, but she is going to have an abortion. This upsets him that she made this decision without him and he wants to change her mind. She doesn't want to hear it thoughClare is not at the Christmas Party and this makes Mr. Harrison quite upset. They go to the police, but they won't do anything at first. It isn't until her boyfriend, Chris Hayden (Art Hindle) comes down to the throw a fit that Lt. Ken Fuller (John Saxon) gets involved. There's a 13 year old girl who goes missing around this time as well. A search results in a grisly discovery and Jess reports the obscene phone calls to the police. This leads them to tapping the phone so they can trace where the calls are coming from. It leads to quite a shocking discovery as we see other members of this house fall victim to this madman.I can say, much like how I felt after my second viewing, I do enjoy this film more and more with each viewing. After my second viewing I did know that this film is interesting is that it is regarded as influencing Halloween. There was almost consideration of making more horror films around holidays like this. Something I have to give this film is that basing it around Christmas is great. You have students going away for the holidays or just going home for them, so people can go missing and no one notices it.The killer in this film is quite creepy as well. The prank calls he is making are quite unnerving if I'm going to be perfectly honest. What I find interesting is the remake uses the things he says in this one to expand the story of the film for that one. I almost like that we never really figure out why some of things are said or who the names correlate to. I do like that he incorporates conversations from the house though, because it points to Peter as the prime suspect.I've heard debates whether this film is a slasher or if it is proto-slasher. There aren't very many kills in this one. They're spaced out quite a bit and it really focuses more on the mystery of who is doing it. That almost makes it feel more like a giallo. The issue then becomes though the ending of the movie. I don't want to spoil it, but that doesn't really mesh with how those films normally end. This does give us quite a bit of police procedural.There are still some glaring issues with this film for me though. The first is how no one discovers the body of Clare. She is positioned right in front of a window and we shown that you can see her from the street. I get there could be frost on the window, but at the end of the film, no one checks the attic. This is just kind of laughable to me after everything that goes down. The next issue I have will be with the pacing.I've already kind of touched on this. I just feel this film is a bit boring. It gets right into it, we get our introductions to the characters and the first murder is right there within the first 15 minutes. We do go through quite a bit of a lull before anything else happens. I like the investigation aspect of trying to find the missing girl. We just get a lot of drama aspects and kind of shy away from the horror for just a bit too long. I do think that the film does find its way and builds tension, but just some lulls I have issues with.The acting of the film is good. I absolutely love Hussey. She is quite young in this film, but I love her determination here. This film is actually ahead of its time here as she is a modern woman that is going to abort her pregnancy because she isn't ready for motherhood yet. This is actually very relevant now and she won't be told what to do by Peter. Dullea I think is good and it is interesting, because he really shows us toxic masculinity. I get part of it is the time this film came out, but that doesn't change it. Kidder is solid as the drunk and actually brings some good humor, the same with Waldman. It was fun seeing Saxon and Hindle in this film. I think that the rest of the cast really do round out the film for what was needed as well.I'll move next to the effects of the film. To be honest, they really aren't a lot of them as they do hide quite a bit. I do like the look of Clare after she's been killed. The blood in the film is a bit orange, but I chalk that up to being the era of the film. Mrs. Mac's death is also pretty cool as well. I'd say that overall, they were done practically and look fine to me.Now with that said, I give this film a lot of respect for its significance and its place in history. My rating does seem to be keep coming up with every viewing I have of it, so that is it too. I like the idea of this film, but I would have liked them to go a bit farther. I don't need everything explained, I just like more than what we got. It does get a bit boring as it focuses on some things that can bog it down. The climax and ending are good. The acting really does carry the film and the depth of the main characters is still socially relevant. It is a bit light on the effects, but they're done practically so that really does help. The soundtrack of the film really doesn't stand out, the Christmas music does set the mood of the time of year. I do think that this is a good movie and actually, it does have some socially commentary that is relevant. I would recommend this even if you don't like horror as it is has a good mystery.",Black Christmas
77,raulfaust,Real deal,6,18 January 2013,"I tried to watch this movie many times, but something always had to stop me. Yesterday I finally could see it entirely. From the get go it seems to be an extremely creepy movie, mostly because of the dark version of ""Silent Night"", but after some moments I could see it wouldn't be that scary. Plot is interesting and sometimes even funny, mainly because of those old people saying such bad words all the time-- come on, old women from a convent aren't supposed to be that rude. What bores me the most is that it took too long for something nice to happen, along with that annoying telephone ringing all the time. However, last scenes are suffocating. That scene with a girl in bed, supposedly sleeping, creeped me out, since ANYTHING could happen to scare the spectator. Happily, directors in that era weren't that mean with us. Surely this film inspired ""When a stranger calls"" and some others, but it is no big deal after all.",Black Christmas
78,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,You couldn't pay me enough money to get me to go in that attic.,10,1 February 2014,"Random thoughts about this chilling classic: Several years before John Carpenter's wildly overrated Halloween, there was Bob Clark's Black Christmas, quite possibly the best, most underrated horror/ thriller ever produced. Presumably, Carpenter shares this adoration, as Halloween is, at times, a scene-for-scene ripoff.Sweet girl Claire is the first one to be killed in a surprisingly brutal burst of violence by a psycho killer stalking a sorority house at Christmastime. Her dead body, with a plastic coat bag wrapped over her head, is a chilling sight (one which was, unfortunately, revealed on the front cover of the original video box!) Her father then shows up to search for her, around the same time another girl is attacked in the park, and ..... a string of obscene, threatening phone calls plague the missing girl's sorority house.Margot Kidder's character amusingly gives the psycho caller a tongue lashing of his own, before he very calmly states, ""I'm going to kill you,"" and softly hangs up the phone. Chilling and intentionally humorous, not an easy combination to pull off. Indeed, the film's first two thirds are also played largely for intentional humour, to give the audience a chance to breathe in between acts of violence by the unseen killer - which only make his violent outbursts even more shocking.Peter's right eye brightly lit by a lamp, while the rest of his face is largely darkened in shadow, as Jess tells him she's pregnant; then later, we see the killer's left eye brightly lit twice, while the rest of him is in shadows. Silhouette of killer's hair looks similar to Peter, but his clothing is different. Was that director Bob Clark showing us the killer, or providing us with a red herring? And why did Peter go around at the back of the house, and smash his way through the basement window to get to Jess, immediately after the killer was chasing her? Good timing on his part, or incredibly poor timing? One of my favourite scenes has John Saxon's Lt. Fuller walking into a pitch black piano room, silhouetted in the doorway, switching the lights on to see Peter's piano, smashed to bits. Fuller walks toward it in complete silence, and we can see the gears turning over in his mind as he imagines the possibilities of Peter being a violent killer.Strikingly beautiful photography in the wintry setting, and inside the sorority house, is another major asset.Hauntingly beautiful, minimalist music score (which, according to composer Carl Zittrer, was accomplished by lightly strumming wooden forks over piano wire) added to its already odd atmosphere, without distracting from it.I cannot think of anything I would change about this film, nor can I think of any other movie with so many unanswered questions, yet which still contains such a satisfying ending- an ending which still sends a chill down my spine. As we recap the scenes of the crimes, the telephone starts to ring and continues endlessly in the silent night.That ending recap, incidentally, was copied almost identically four years later by John Carpenter in Halloween. A vastly inferior film, in my opinion.",Black Christmas
79,Christmas-Reviewer,A little Weird but 100% enjoyable,7,11 December 2016,"Over the years the ""Halloween"" ""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm St"" films have become the Monster Movies of the late 20th century. Instead of having ""Dracula"" ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Mummy"" we had ""Michael Myers"" ""Jason Voorhees"" and ""Freddy Kruger"". Well a few years before those movie villains hit the screen there was another killer who packed a powerful punch his name was Billy and he was terrifying in the 1974 film ""Black Christmas"". To me he is the scariest man in movie history.This 1974 film is not well known. It is however 10x better than most other horror movies pf the 1970's and 1980's! This film has many things that seemed to of inspired ""Halloween"". The opening shots and set up were almost identical to ""Halloween"" which was released 4 years later. In this film As winter break begins, a group of sorority sisters, including Jess (Olivia Hussey) and the often inebriated Barb (Margot Kidder), begin to receive anonymous, lascivious phone calls. Initially, Barb eggs the caller on, but stops when he responds threateningly. Soon, Barb's friend Claire (Lynne Griffin) goes missing from the sorority house, and a local adolescent girl is murdered, leading the girls to suspect a serial killer is on the loose. But no one realizes just how near the culprit is.This film developed a cult following and was later remade. The original however is still an edge of your seat thriller! If you like horror films then get this. You will love it!",Black Christmas
80,slayrrr666,"A tad overrated, but still a great movie",7,29 December 2007,"""Black Christmas"" is a pretty disappointing proto-slasher.**SPOILERS**Gathering for a Christmas party, Jess Bradford, (Olivia Hussey) Barbara Coard, (Margot Kidder) Phyllis Carlson, (Andrea Martin) and Claire Harrison, (Lynne Griffin) along with Mrs. MacHenry, (Marian Waldman) all prepare for their Sorority party. As the night goes on, they are continued to be inundated with a series of obscene phone calls that many say have been going on for awhile. As they take place, they also find that some of the other sorority members have gone missing, and pleading with Lieutenant Kenneth Fuller, (John Saxon) does nothing as he claims to be more prioritized with another case. Forced back in the sorority house as there's nothing the police can do, the calls continue and the others disappear, making the others realize that there's something wrong with the calls. Checking back in with the police, they realize that there's a killer in the house and try to get out before they encounter him.The Good News: There wasn't a whole lot to this one, as it was surprisingly disappointing. The main source this one gets right is the mystery of the killer. We never see the killer's face aside from a hand and a spastic looking eyeball. We never learn the killer's true motives or identity, or why he decided to plague this particular sorority house. That is just eerie and really makes the killer a lot more fearsome when the identity remains a secret. The film does a spectacular job of making the killer feel really threatening without doing a whole lot. Even more important is that, early in the film, the killer establishes a trademark method of operation, which is maintained rather faithfully throughout the movie. Immediately after dispatching a victim, he immediately places an obscene phone call to the house. That works wonders, especially when it's revealed that this has been going on prior to the beginning of the film. During the first phone call, one remarks that it's the moaner again the, meaning that he has called before. This fits with the later fact that several townspeople have been raped on the college campus during the recent weeks. There's also the fact that the killer starts toying with them in incredibly perverse ways and the tormenting gets more and more vulgar as time goes on. That allows for more fear from the killer, and all of the calls actually go a long way; as well as the other tactics, to make the killer something to be feared. When it switches over to the later calls, it gets even more disturbing and even more furious. From this point on, the caller exhibits obvious symptoms of multiple-personality-disorder, and we hear him switching between three different voices within the course of one call, often times the different voices even overlap one another. It's a neat trick, and again goes even further towards making the killer the ultimate creep. From the moments where just the POV is seen running across the landscape with just the breathing voice heard to the sense of humor displayed with the strangulation gag that comes from the simply mind-blowing original finale, the killer here is one of the best in the genre. A couple of the attacks are pretty cool as well, especially the bedroom one where the screams are drowned out by the caroling group downstairs as well as one where a victim is lured in and attacked with a giant pulley system. These here provide the film's only good points.The Bad News: This one here wasn't all that impressive, with it's laurels really resting on a couple of areas. This one has such a dull and boring middle section that most of the problems are found here. The film decides to stack in as many different scenes and subplots in here to stretch the film out that after a while it gets incredibly dull and boring. From the pregnancy subplot that has nothing to do at all with any of the film's proceedings once it's given to the missing towns-person going missing along with the search by the police, this film is super padded out to ridiculous lengths. These take up a large amount of the film's time to take in with certain areas of the plots that contain nothing of importance in the final count. There's also the fact that this one is a complete mystery surrounding the killer. While it's nice to finally get a mystery, not even being sure of the killer's name is taking it a bit too far. This occurs in a conversation as a line that the person on the other end spouts, yet nothing is confirmed as to whether it's the actual name or whether it's a person who caused the psycho to go homicidal. Other names are dropped in the course of the conversations, but again, not even having something as simplistic as a name is a big shame in the film. Other factors in here, from the reasoning behind the rampage to the motive of selecting this particular sorority, manage to force into the viewer such a state of confusion that there's a really volley of emotions over being scared and annoyed over the killer. The fact that a lot of questionable tactics are put into play over what he tries to do with them or not is another big factor with this one, and in the end, this one ends up feeling very disappointing.The Final Verdict: With a lot of dull moments in this one and a couple of somewhat decent moments, this one comes across as a merely disappointing effort. This is one really for those who have a big fascination with the early-going slashers or are into the film's positives, while those who prefer faster-paced fare should seek caution.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence",Black Christmas
81,moviewizguy,It's a Lot Better than the Remake,8,7 October 2007,"This 98-minute film is a stark and stylish horror/thriller that turns everyone's favorite time of the year inside out. Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder star among an ill-fated houseful of sorority sisters celebrating the holiday season. Festivities turn fatal when obscene phone calls break the serenity and it becomes clear that a psychopath is stalking the house.Instead of watching this movie first, I watched the remake of it, which was horrible. Watching this, I was surprised how many small body counts there are compared to the remake but I wasn't surprised it was less bloody, which is a good thing. The violence, which was the problem in the remake, does not turn you off.What I like about this movie is that it focuses more on the characters than the kills. I love the characters, including Marian Waldman and Margot Kidder, both who seem to have a good time giving us plenty of laughs. I also like Olivia Hussey's performance.Yeah, there are some clichés here but it was made in the past, okay? I didn't mind the generic ending, which is used in most horror movies these days. What I also like in here is the suspense. There are some scenes that really scares you.I'm sure this movie is underrated and should be better than it is today.

83,m-47826,Very disappointing.,2,4 October 2020,"I heard and read great things about this movie. Some people even implied it invented the genre, before Halloween did. I highly disagree. It's more of a thriller than a slasher. And it is so slow and boring you don't even manage to get into it. Even during the « death scenes », in which nothing is clear and everything is suggested, only in a very confusing and obscure way. I had a hard time taking it seriously. This and the chatty dialogues spoiled the experience. The ending gave a sense of eeriness, but it was far too late. Not a movie I plan on rewatching, and probably stick with that 2006 remake. At least there was some action.",Black Christmas
84,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Classic and creepy,8,1 September 2014,"My favorite film is and always will be My Bloody Valentine (1981). However, I love slasher films in general and Black Christmas sadly was remade in 2006, leaving this nostalgic original thrill-ride behind in the dust. What people forget often is that this one is way better in terms of characters, plot and soundtrack. I will say that the phone call they got in the first few minutes was incredibly disgusting and seemed over-the-top even for a horror film, but aside from that, this is one slasher you won't want to pass up! Nothing says Merry Christmas like a crazy maniac making prank calls and killing girls in a sorority house!",Black Christmas

86,punishmentpark,"""I know(!); Something dirty, ain't it?""",9,23 January 2015,"Finally, a second viewing of a slasher classic, or at least a father to the slasher genre, though not the only one; 'Psycho' (1960), 'The girl who knew too much' (1963), 'Reazione a catena' (1971) and maybe even the elusive 'Delitto al luna park' (1952), if one is willing to interconnect the giallo with the slasher - they all amount to one big happy bloody (this one is relatively not so bloody, by the way) family to me. This one I remember as being particularly atmospheric and creepy, but I never rated it higher than 7 out of 10.After having seen it again just the other night, a theory entered my mind: the piano player did it after all! I have several observations to substantiate this, but first, a few things which director Bob Clarke has stated (if I may believe the - very interesting! - list of trivia here on IMDb): 1. 'Clark (-) insisted that the ending be ambiguous', which means Clark máy have had a certain explanation in mind. 2. 'Clark considered it to be more of a psychological horror film than a slasher film', which will fall exactly in line with my theory. 3. '...The ending of the film forces people to think independently' Again, not a debunking, nor a confirmation, so...So, Peter did it, I'm thinking now. Why? The ending (in the attic', which could be metaphorically observed as 'the mind', the 'top floor') is a way to mess with the viewer and offers an insight to the schizophrenic mind. Next, all the times and places when and where Peter could be at the times of the calls and the murders pan out. In other words, he has NO alibi(s)! Then there are the strange coincidences. Peter shows up behind Jess just after she received a call and the reason he wouldn't kill her right then and there, is because he may still hope for her to choose to have their baby. This 'baby' (/abortion) motif that haunts Peter is also is very important to my theory, as the caller's voices refer to it many times - 'baby Agnes'... When he is finally convinced Jess will not have the baby and she tries to escape, he makes his final move. Which brings us all to the basement (scene). How coincidental would it be that Peter would just show up there, let alone that he knows Jess is there?In terms of general logics it is very strange that the whole house wasn't searched when Clare went missing, when some even feared she might have hurt herself. I mean, it is just common sense then, to check the attic and the basement (if not by the police, then certainly by her roommates and friends) - another little sign? I'm really unsure about that part. All in all, my theory does agree with Clark's statement that this is a psychological horror; Peter is both the brilliant and savvy artist, ánd the demented and traumatized killer - a schizophrenic if I'm not mistaken.Perhaps the film should be considered a hermetic, atmospheric piece of modern art, disguised as a slasher (oops, that term wasn't even invented yet in 1974!) with comedic elements - I know(!); something dirty, ain't it?"" Personally, I didn't know whether to love or hate those 'funny parts' (the silly cop, the drunk lady of the house), but there's always next time...In any case, it is a most artful thriller of the eeriest kind, I was way off with my first rating; 9 out of 10 this time around.",Black Christmas

88,oneguyrambling,"A little dated, but still better than 60% of horror films released lately.",7,5 November 2010,"Every time a remake is released (which is almost every week) these days I feel more compelled to seek out the source material to see why it needed remaking in the first place, as in 90% of cases the remake is worse or just as lousy as the original.I never saw the remake of Black Christmas, it looked altogether too teen-y for me and I'm not a big slasher flick fan anyway. But I did read something that said that it was a remake of perhaps the first slasher flick, which at least piqued my interest as it is always interesting to see where certain genres originated.After viewing what is immediately evident is that 35 odd years ago it was apparently unsettling enough to simply set up the kill and then have the killer do the rest. There are no intricate 7 minute ""creeping through the halls"" or red herring scares here, the victims decide to do something, enter the room in which they will do that thing, and the killer does the rest quickly and in straightforward fashion.Nowadays to achieve the same result the filmmakers have to build the tension or ramp up the gore, guess which one they normally go for ('eh Eli?).The supposed big twist (copied by Scream) is actually made evident in the very opening scene, as we are introduced to ""Stalker-Cam"" (TM) as someone cases a house from the outside, while a party seems to be going on inside. Said individual then climbs up and into the attic of the house.It turns out we are in what I think they call a frat-house in the US, a communal dorm for students, in this case all female with a middle aged, seemingly alcoholic dorm mother.The girls are having an end of term party before either heading home or settling in for the Christmas holidays. The party is interrupted by an obscene phone call, as the girls are all in their late teens / early 20s they put the phone on speaker and have a chuckle. Of course some are offended and others get into the swing of things and actually try to talk back to the caller, but ultimately no harm is done and they hang up, thinking that's that.Seeing as the film doesn't waste time in building tension or suspense, we get a fair bit of time spent getting to know the individual girls, there are no cardboard cut-outs here (I'm talking to you Friday the 13th remake!), there are drunken sluts, naive young women and other normal girls, same as every group of students. They are beset by the usual circumstances that occur to the age group, horny suitors, teenage pregnancy, busybody adults and the allure of alcohol and mischief.When quite suddenly (to them at least) a member of their number goes missing, they don't just shrug it off as so many crappy horror movies do today by saying ""Oh, she must have gone to the shops"" or ""She'll show up"", they treat the disappearance seriously, and as they care for their missing friend so too does the audience care more.The crank calls keep coming and they keep getting more and more disturbing, I would question why the girls keep listening but it is a movie after all. In between a small collection of bodies builds up, again this isn't a 73 dead slash fest as many are today and the remaining girls come across all sorts of roadblocks when trying to solve the issue, not the least of which is incompetent police work.When the ending comes it is in keeping with the rest of the flick, straightforward and basic, and there is no realllll surprise unless you have never ever seen a horror film in your life. What would concern though is the outrageously terrible police investigation that follows that wraps everything up so nicely whilst ignoring so many events and incidents.Again, this was the 70s, maybe they just didn't care too much back then about the details.Final Rating – 7 / 10. You aren't going to see anything new, but I'd rather watch this than most big budget horror remakes churned out these days.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Black Christmas

I actually saw the remake of Black Christmas before I saw this, maybe that's why I don't like it as much. In other words, I'm saying I like the remake better than the original. Usually, it's the other way around. It does have some good parts; like the killing scenes, and it has the classic look of the 70's. People are always saying this is the original slasher and HALLOWEEN isn't, but that doesn't matter to me. It doesn't matter which is the original slasher, because I love HALLOWEEN better.

90,Maciste_Brother,Overrated!,2,27 November 2003,"SpoilersBLACK Christmas is neither scary or even creepy. And it's definitely not the first slasher. The amount of buzz this film has is truly perplexing. This film often played on TV during the late 1970s and early 1980s and I watched it a couple of times then and it didn't even scare me then, when I was 13-14 years old, and the movie still didn't create any sense of dread or horror today. The pacing is sloooow. The killings are boring and the whole idea is mishandled, with too much time spent with the stupid police officers and the sorta seedy side of the gals, such as the scene with that old woman finding a bottle of alcohol in the toilet, which adds nothing to the movie. The good cast of actors overacts shamelessly. But the worst part of this bland movie is the ending. The woman just killed her boyfriend and she's in shock and the police leave her alone at the house?!?! Now come on! That's totally ridiculous! The ending just doesn't work because it defies common sense. Watch the original THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE instead.

92,gedikreverdi,Billy's calling,6,25 January 2021,They were receiving obscene phone calls at the sorority house. It seems that the definition of cool has changed a lot ever since as Barb was trying so hard to be cool and so do that angry sweaty pianist but they were so cringe. Claire was killed first at the party and she was put on a rocking chair wrapped in plastic. A children found in the park murdered and the sorority girls joined the search party with the father of Claire for Claire. Peter was mad at his girlfriend Jesse about her wanting to have an abortion and the police and the girls suspected him. The sorority mother went to the attic after the cat before leaving the house and billy killed her with a hook. Barb was sleeping in her bed and billy went down and killed her with the glass unicorn's horn while the kids at the door were singing to Jesse. And the police were so obsessed to track the obscene calls and finally they found it to be from the sorority house. The police at the front was killed too and the officer called Jesse to tell her to leave the house but she wanted upstairs to warn the two but found both barb and Phill dead in the same bed. And got away to the basement and peter broke the window and got into the basement but Jesse was scared because she thought he's the killer. The police found peter dead and Jesse in shock and thought Jesse killed the murdered but billy was still at the attic with his first two victims. Claire was staring out of the attic window the whole time but no one just happened to see her nor did they check the attic. The phone was ringing again and Jesse was sleeping in shock in the house alone with billy. Who's billy? Why is he doing all these? No answers. None. And billy sounded like an annoying kid trying to be scary the whole time. But still it was said to be a slasher classic so I had to check it off my watchlist. It was creepy at times especially the way how Claire looked in the rocking chair but we need to know about his motives.,Black Christmas
93,IonicBreezeMachine,A foundation of the slasher sub genre that is a good film in its own right.,8,25 November 2020,"In the weeks leading up to Christmas, a sorority house is harassed by obscene phone calls that serve as a prelude to chilling murders.Released in 1974 to respectable box office and mixed reviews, the film helped pave the way for future films such as John Carpenter's Halloween and Sean S. Cunningham's Friday the 13th. But even taking its influence on future films out of the equation, Black Christmas is a chilling and well made thriller.Bob Clark strikes a good balance between character based moments, humorous moments, and suspenseful moments to build a film where the scares come organically from build up and release rather than through overuse of jump scares. Clark makes good use of the perspective from both the killer and the women in the sorority house, and we never learn anything about the killer other than whatever insane rants he divulges over his obscene calls that are so loosely constructed they may or may not contain the truth.The movie is anchored by great performances as well. John Saxon does a good job of playing the investigating officer Lt. Fuller, and Margot Kidder as the house's brash acerbic Barb brings some subtle hints of humanity to what could have easily just been a hate sink for the audience to want to die, but easily the best performance is Olivia Hussey as Jess. Jess is a fantastic protagonist who we see dealing with the dilemma of terminating a pregnancy despite her boyfriend's objections, and she brings that inner struggle to her performance quite well. She also conveys a caring nature thatmakes her an endearing character who we like spending time with.Black Christmas is a classic for a reason.

94,gizmomogwai,Early Canadian/slasher flick is better than expected,7,8 October 2013,"Created when both Canadian cinema and slasher movies were in their infancy, Black Christmas is a film that effectively creates a creepy atmosphere with solid production values. It follows a familiar plot where a college sorority is receiving obscene phone calls, before each of the girls is murdered in the house. Eventually, the police trace the calls and they're finding they're coming from the house, too. I wondered if this movie started the cliché- I just looked it up and see the urban legend goes back to the '60s. It's not much of a surprise that the calls were coming from the house, even overlooking how well-known the cliché is now- for one thing, the killer is clearly in the house, and at another point, it's mentioned there's two lines.Some parts of this movie are well-done. Take the fact that one of the girls is killed while children are downstairs singing Christmas carols. That's juxtaposition reminiscent of the baptismal scene in The Godfather, though not as great. The movie is a little silly after the call is traced- Jess could have saved her skin instantly by taking three steps towards the door and going out to the police. Instead, she goes up the stairs. Reminds me of Tippi Hedren asking Hitchcock why she would go into the room at the end of The Birds (1963). Hitchcock's reply: ""Because I told you to.""I heard this movie described as a whodunit, but it's not much of a whodunit. The movie leads you to believe the protagonist Jess' boyfriend Peter is the killer even before the police identify him as a suspect. Then it's revealed it's not him... it's not entirely clear who it is. It could just be some random guy. That was kind of cheap, and the implication that he killed Jess, while cold and creepy, wouldn't have been as satisfying as the damsel-in-distress killing the bad guy. Oh well- Black Christmas works, and is a fine film for what it is.",Black Christmas

96,ODDBear,A must see horror film,9,13 January 2004,"Predating Halloween and it's countless clones in the stalk'n slash genre, I have to say this movie really serves up the goods. Sure, to today's audience it may seem a bit slow and dated but to the true fan, this is a masterpiece of the genre. A madman hides in the attic of a sorority house, telephones the girls from upstairs and eventually starts killing some of them.So many elements have been lifted from this film and utilized to great effect, think of When A Stranger Calls, Halloween, Scream and countless sorority slashers to name a few, this movie has to be termed as somewhat of a groundbreaker. Filmed with a low budget, director Clark relies solely on mood, lighting and atmosphere to give the film it's edge. He succeeds brilliantly. Apart from a rather tedious 10-15 minute segment involving the housekeeper of the sorority the film absolutely keeps it's tension filled grip on the viewer and doesn't let go at all. I even found myself shouting at the tube, telling the girl ""don't do this, don't go there"", and I can't remember ever doing this before or after. Watching it alone (plus, it was at Christmas time) the film totally freaked me out. Acting is way above average for a slasher flick. Olivia Hussey, besides being a total knockout, is very good in the lead role. Margot ""Lois Lane"" Kidder is a delight as the foul mouthed drunk, Keir Dullea fairly creepy as Hussey's not-so-sane boyfriend and genre favourite John Saxon is good as always. For the most part, the humour goes down well also. One particularly funny scene involving a not so bright cop, but that seems to be a regular in Clark's films. If you're a fan of horror films, it doesn't get much better than this. Highly recommended.",Black Christmas
97,TOMASBBloodhound,"A different kind of ""Christmas Story"" from Bob Clark.",7,22 August 2004,"Black Christmas, if nothing else, is a genuinely frightening film. Some have labeled it a ""classic"" but I'm not so sure I can go that far. True it clearly inspired numerous more successful films, but it's just ""good"" when taken on its own.Our story is simple enough. A deranged killer has snuck into the attic of a sorority house just as many of the girls are leaving for Christmas break. This guy is a real wacko. He begins calling the young women on a regular basis and threatening them in often obscure but VERY SPOOKY outbursts of jibberish. Then, he begins picking off those who remain behind one by one. The bulk of the latter half of the film centers around a police detective (John Saxon) trying to get to the bottom of everything and save the lives of the remaining girls. This film works mainly because of two reasons. First of all, this film has an atmosphere of gloom set over it like few I have ever seen before. Even though it's Xmas, and people should be having fun, the characters and the audience as well seem to know something terrible is going on around them. A prime example is the duality we are presented with when the group of carolers are singing to the beautiful Olivia Hussey while Margot Kidder is being stabbed to death in her bed at the same time. The second major factor that helps this film get its point across is the absolutely demented phone calls this killer makes. Wow! I have never heard anything more psychotic in any film that I can remember. These calls really make the case for just how screwed up this guy is. His multiple outbursts and different vocal tones will be ringing in your ears for a while after the film is over.The acting was decent, but I don't think anyone was particularly outstanding. The film had a noticeably restrictive budget, but Clark does what he can. This film sets quite a different tone than his later successes like Porky's and A Christmas Story. It makes me want to check out some of his other thrillers made early in his career.One thing about this film that also can give you the creeps is knowing that this sort of thing has happened in real life! Perhaps the most well-known incident like this was when Ted Bundy, one of America's most famous serial killers, dropped in for a visit to a sorority house at Florida State one evening. The results were very similar to what happened in this film. If you think about it, these houses full of young (and often attractive) women would seem a real beacon to these types of killers. Especially in a college town like the one I live in.Makes you wonder if or when this type of thing could happen again...7 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",Black Christmas
98,The_Movie_Cat,Flat Christmas...,5,6 January 2001,".... would be a more appropriate name for this thoroughly dull supposed shocker, which rarely rises above indifferent.WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS. ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM.John Saxon and Margot Kidder try gamely with a feeble script that tries to offset it's own predictability by crowbarring in misfiring comic setpieces. Not only do these work against the tone of the piece, they also distract from the main plot. The plot itself is so tedious that we have to wait until the last twenty minutes for the police to work out the killer's been in the house all along... something we were shown from the very beginning. This irritating game of catch-up is only expounded upon by the ""twist"" ending, which must be obvious even to an amoeba, and a hundred times more obvious to anyone who's seen that particular episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.To make matters worse, when this movie was shown on American TV they changed the name to Stranger In The House. Wow, what a sensible network decision that was! I wonder if the same network changed the name of Citizen Kane to It's His Sled and Planet of the Apes to It's Earth All Along Really, You Know. This is not even to mention the classic character stupidity, with Olivia Hussey being told to leave the house by the police. So does she get out and leave? Guess.

99,Superunknovvn,"Two outlooks, two different ratings",7,17 March 2009,"""Black Christmas"" was a pioneering movie. It's safe to say that this was one of the first if not THE first slasher-flick of all time. As such, the movie has a lot going for itself. Everything that would later become a cliché is established here: the POV-shot of the killer entering rooms, the creative ways of picking off victims one by one, the final girl, etc. ""Black Christmas"" invented it all. On top of that the movie has top notch direction and an artful cinematography, which is sometimes reminiscent of Dario Argento's work. The acting is fine for the most part, and the mysterious killer and his creepy phone calls give Michael Myers a run for the money. So, if we take all that into consideration, ""Black Christmas"" is a genuine horror masterpiece.However, a lot of time has passed and a lot of slasher movies have been made since 1974. If you watch this movie now for the first time, it won't do much for you. You've seen these ideas before and probably in a more shocking way. ""Black Christmas"" may have been the first movie to do it, but other movies were the ones who made the basic slasher-elements famous.That's hardly director Bob Clark's fault, of course. It's just that if you're not a cineaste, you won't care too much about whether or not this movie was inventive when it first came out. All you'll care about is whether it can surprise and entertain you still, and truth be told, if you've seen the ""Halloween""- and ""Friday The 13th""-flicks or any movies of their ilk, then ""Black Christmas"" probably won't blow you away.However, if you do care about historical movie facts, then you must see Bob Clark's true holiday classic (the ""false"" one being ""A Christmas Story"" from 1983). After all, ""Psycho"" is also respected for the effect it originally had on audiences mostly. Even Hitchcock's masterpiece seems tame and predictable from today's point of view, so why should you be more critical when it comes to judging ""Black Christmas""? For horror buffs, this one is a must, anyway.",Black Christmas
100,acidburn-10,The First Slasher,10,5 March 2007,"The Plot = A group of young college girls decide to stick around they're sorority house for the Christmas holidays, not knowing a mysterious psychopath is hiding in they're attic, making obscene, disturbing phone calls, and that's just the beginning, he eventually proceeds to slaughter the kills one by one in a brutal fashion.Many consider Halloween as the first ever slasher movie but it isn't ""Black Christmas"" is but sadly this gem never managed the popularity ""Halloween"" and remained forgotten for years well until they made that not very good remake last year.Black Christmas was and still is bleak movie that packs a punch and gave me genuine goosebumps from beginning to end. I loved the dark imposing claustrophobic feel, the film handled its now known slasher formula like a freaking pro, tossing our way with full force moments of pure shock, a baffling whodunit, hard hitting plot twists and an expert use of the ""killer is in the house"" motif. The film's firm execution in terms of its conventions. Personally, the element that got under my skin the deepest had to be the killers' phone ramblings. I mean this dude was a hands down, to the core loon. He leaped into these bizarro monologues, taking on different voices (a man, woman, child), going on about things that only he understood while taking the random dramatic pause to slip in a heart felt ""I'm gonna kill you"" in there. What a CLASS ACT! The phone calls butcher boy (or girl) made, established him early on as one crazy mother to be reckoned with and since we never really got to see the lad throughout (apart from his heart warming toying with his victims' cadavers), that turned him into a constant thick cloud of doom spread wide about this tale. You didn't see him but man did you feel him! The acting was top of it's range in this movie Olivia Hussy (Jess) was solid from beginning to end, Keir Dullea (Peter) played his creepy, neurotic part well, I really enjoyed the house mother Mrs Mac she was great and stole every scene she was in, Margot Kidder was the stand out in this movie and brought in some much needed humor as the alcoholic and chain smoking drunk. Actors always come through when they play themselves. Another statement to that rule applied to John Saxon (LT Fuller) who once more played John Saxon...he was wonderful at it as per usual. Doug McGrath (Nash) was responsible for a few straight chuckles as the incompetent cop.Okay the murders may not be gory but they're still nasty and quite brutal like We get a girl being choked by a plastic bag, a semi blood wet stabbing and after the fact damaged corpses. Although not too graphic, the film still hit hard via the viciousness behind its dirty deeds.The directing was top notch Clark set up an unsettling dark mood from frame one, exploiting his creepy setting fully while giving us hints of slick style on the way (loved the killer POV shots and the slow motion). He also liked to inter-cut murder sequences with mundane events which made the scenes quite effective. And I have to give the man extra credit for two things: 1- That very scary shot of the eyeball (you'll know when u see it) killed me and the ending (which I won't dare give away) was brilliant.All in all Black Christmas is a definite cult classic because it's a well rounded horror flick.",Black Christmas
101,alice liddell,A creepy tonic to Christmas cheer.,8,6 October 1999,"An excellent horror film, which manages to build up a quiet, considerable power.  While it may not be out-and-out BOO! YIKES! scary (very little is these days), it combines narrative and subtext to an agreeably creepy pitch. Imagine an episode of THE X-FILES without the gloss, or alien nonsense, or enervating conspiracy theories, or even Mulder and Scully.  Even the amusing accents (the film is Canadian) cease to grate after a while.The story is set in a placid all-girl sorority house on campus in some Canadian university, at Christmas time.  The girls are having a sedate party with some boy friends.  Outside a breathing camera lurches towards the house...  Like Argento's SUSPIRIA, this all-female community is the site of the most horrific repressions, anxieties, fears, waiting to burst out, both within (figured as alcoholism, unwanted pregnancy) and without (rapes, murders, obscene phone calls).  Cleverly, though, the girls don't go hysterically loopy - everything remains externalised - much more chilling, even if it lacks the full on psychogynaecology of the Italian masterpiece.For example, one girl's mother is clearly indifferent to her, gold-digging, she claims, after other men.  Another is a virgin who has previously, we deduce, lived in a very repressive, rigid family atmosphere.  Indeed, one of the noteworthy things about BLACK is how these girls are away from home for the first time - they have cut away from authority, patriarchy and tradition.  The film is not necessarily a reactionary plea, however - the girls' substitute authority figures - boyfriends - become the locus of the terror; and although their self-made family verges on the parodic (with their seemingly jovial, frustrated alcoholic housekeeper as mother substitute), it is a genuine, if finally useless, structure of support.I suppose the film could be seen as an examination of the deep traumas buried underneath the vociferous self-confidence of contemporary feminism - after all, it was directed by the man who would make that radical treatise on gender relations, PORKY'S.  The main plot centres on the lead's right to have an abortion, and the terrifying phone calls - a horrifying, babbling cacophony from the beyond - seem like the pleas of a dying child, or the malicious threats of an Id-mother.  The idea of the disembodied or unreferential voice (those things denied a presence in the film, and maybe our society; e.g. the psychological trauma of abortion), miscommunication, misread signs, disinformation all suggest a culture where all recognisable meaning has gone haywire.  As this is the film's anxiety, we may feel that it is somewhat right-wing.On the other hand, it's thematic interest is the family, set in a family away from a 'real' family.  The BLACK of the title in relation to CHRISTMAS suggests diabolical overtones, a distorted mirror of the Holy Family celebrated at this time.  Maybe the film is reactionary - charging newly independent women with destroying the structures of family and tradition, and unloosing untold terrors and demons.Or maybe it's very sympathetic to the characters' plight.  Patriarchy in all its forms pervade the film - the unseen killer/rapist; the ineffectual police lieutenant; the self-obsessed boyfriends; the downright idiotic cop. The only clever, likable characters are the women.  And, as in the case of Barb, their rejection of family is not necessarily willed.  The path to independence is certainly not made easy in this culture.The great thing about BLACK is how it shows the sheer ineffectuality of trying to specify the unspecifiable.  It is obviously madness to think that Peter could have committed all these crimes, and yet it is quite reasonable to demonise him - he reveals the monster beneath the sensitive New Man. The heroine discovers that she can rely on no-one but herself.  Even this isn't enough.  Notwithstanding the unreassuring ending, she still has to deal with the fallout of her actions, which are by no means resolved.  There is still the issue of the abortion, which is one reason the demon is not dead. There were obscene phone calls and rapes before she knew she was pregnant: the fears may be subjective, but the inability to connect everything makes the film the more scarily effective.As a horror film, BLACK's excellence derives from the disparity between the hysteria of the subject matter, and the cool film style, suggestive, sinister, yet withdrawn.  The breathy point of view camerawork may seem tiresome after HALLOWEEN and its dozy imitators, but here the idea of something submerged, concealed, unknowable, unconquerable, not even human, never mind the cartoon slasher we're used to, is superbly realised, slowing down time.  The images of the first dead girl, with the doll baby in her lap, and the cat purring beside her, will haunt me for a long, long time.",Black Christmas

Bob Clark take us to a sorority house with a killer stalking a group of college girls, the thrilling story is full of a gray atmosphere, great acting and a scary house! The slasher film was originally born in 1960 with Peeping Tom (UK) and Psycho (USA), but in 1974, Canada brought it first slasher, the amazing Black Christmas.

Until a mysterious stranger makes weird phone calls as he torments the girls then sneaks into the attic of the house as he starts to kill some of the girls one by one. The police are concerned by strange murders going on especially the discovery of a dead 13 year old girl in a park but can the cops find this psychopath or will he have his bloody hands on the entire household? Suspenseful and masterful psychological horror slasher flick from Canada and writer-director Bob Clark who would later give us ""Porky's"" and ""A Christmas Story"". It's a true masterpiece of the slasher genre in the 70's with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Halloween"", ""Torso"" and Mario Bay's ""Twitch of The Death Nerve"" (a.k.a. Bay of Blood) but this was before ""Halloween"" hit the screen 4 years later. The film also stars John Saxon who is one of cult cinema's best actors, it's a scary and chilling skin-crawler that will keep you guessing till the very end. Unlike most slasher movies which uses gore, this one uses characterizations and tension rather then just brainless blood-buckets. This is a true underrated horror masterpiece that every horror fan should seek and paved the way for other slasher flicks like ""Halloween"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Friday The 13th"", ""Maniac"", ""Sleepaway Camp"", ""The Burning"", ""Scream"" etc. as it ranks up with ""Psycho"".",Black Christmas
104,LoneWolfAndCub,One of the BEST horror films,10,26 March 2006,"Black Christmas is a very underrated and un-recognised Canadian horror film from director Bob Clarke (probably most known for the raunchy comedy Porkys). This came before Halloween, Friday the 13th, When A Stranger Calls or A Nightmare on Elm Street. This is what started the slasher genre. This created the killer's POV shots, the creepy scores and the obscene phone calls.There really isn't a huge plot here, it is basically about a group of girls in a sorority house are being terrorised by obscene phone calls. No one has any idea who it is calling them. Slowly, each one goes missing and everyone becomes more aware of what is going on.Despite the minimal plot, this is THE slasher film. It has an extremely creepy score that will have the hairs on your neck standing, very effective cinematography (the house is perfect), a great group of younger, great camera work and older actresses/actors and it packs a walloping twist at the end. The lack of gore or violence suits the movie PERFECTLY. If they had shown the killings in full detail, it would not have been as good. One murder (involving a glass unicorn) is the stand-out, being one of the most recognised murder scenes in horror movie history.Many people consider Halloween the original slasher, that is not the case. BLACK Christmas is the ORIGINAL slasher. But it is much more than that. Instead of a cast of complete asses, we have a group of smarter people. They die not because of idiocy, but because of accident or just the wrong place in the wrong time. There is also some great humour tied in. Margot Kidder being the funniest of them all.The movie gives me the chills, especially the ending, which is the greatest in my opinion, of any horror movie. I urge anyone who considers themselves a horror fan to see this.5/5.",Black Christmas
105,Nightman85,You'll want to unplug the phone before you watch this movie.,10,24 July 2006,"Being a big fan of the horror genre, it takes an above average horror film to give me chills. This highly influential horror-thriller does just that, every time I see it!As a college sorority house empties out for the holidays, the remaining girls are unaware that a warped murderer has just climbed into their attic...Black Christmas is one of the most shamefully over-looked films in the slasher film genre, it's also been one of the most inspiring films of the genre. The story that drives this film is an extremely creepy one, taught with suspense, mystery, and an undying feeling of dread. It's also an intelligent story that wisely remembers that the unseen is scarier than anything one can put on film. Director Bob Clark builds an atmosphere of almost unnerving tension through out this film. Clark makes even the singing of Christmas carols very chilling. Adding even more to the sheer spookiness of this film is Carl Zitter's bizarre music score, which sounds as twisted as the killer's brain. A number of scenes from this film are simply unforgettable - the insane phone calls from the murderer, the glass unicorn stabbing, and my personal favorite, our heroine turning to see the killer's eye staring at her from behind the bedroom door.The cast of this film is great and contains a number of stars. The wonderful Olivia Hussey is sympathetic as our leading lady. Keir Dullea is strong as Hussey's boy friend, who's been behaving rather strangely. Margot Kidder provides some comic relief as the sorority bad-girl. John Saxon is solid as the police lieutenant who's trying to solve a murder. Supporting cast Marian Waldman, Andrea Martin, Art Hindle, and Douglas McGrath are terrific as well.Black Christmas has had a big hand in the slasher genre, such films as Halloween (1978), When a Stranger Calls (1979), and Friday the 13th (1980) were strongly influenced by this forgotten classic. For horror fans, Black Christmas is a must-see terror. I wouldn't recommend that you watch it alone in the dark though.**** out of ****",Black Christmas
106,Shattered_Wake,One of the creepiest films ever made - A great slasher,8,26 December 2008,"Over Christmas break, a sorority house is terrorized by a mysterious obscene caller. Eventually, the terror increases as the sorority sisters are, one by one, viciously murdered by a psychopathic killer.Let me just say: With the proper viewing atmosphere, Black Christmas can, easily, be one of the creepiest and frightening films around. Stick yourself in a dark room with no light but the Christmas tree, make sure it's nice and snowy outside, and empty the house. Have all of those, and prepare to be scared out of your wits. Unfortunately for me this time around, all I had was the dark room and empty house. No tree, no snow. But, that didn't stop the film from being nearly as chilling. In addition to the chills the film delivers, it also succeeds in its technical aspects. Moore's script is very good, with a nice even flow throughout. It manages to flesh out the 'important' characters and make them seem more complete, even though some of the other characters are pretty much forgotten. Also, though some don't, I very much liked the lack of resolution. The late Bob Clark's direction, of course, was also damn fine. It worked well and took full advantage of the beautiful sorority house. The acting, on occasion, failed. Olivia Hussey, whom I never found to be a GREAT actress, was for the most part good, but still seemed a bit over-the-top on occasion. It wasn't enough to distract from the quality however, and can easily be overlooked. In the end, Black Christmas (1974) is a success of chilling slasher cinema that fans of such films as Halloween should truly love.Obligatory Christmas-Horror Elements:Subgenre: SlasherChristmas Carols: The soundtrack is primarily made up of holiday tunes.Snow: That there is.Person in a Santa suit: Yes, we see a Santa-clad person a few times.Violence/Gore: It's not as 'bad' as the remake, but there is a bit. The deaths are certainly better here.Sex/Nudity: None, although the phone calls are pretty graphic.Scares/Suspense: Endless. This is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen and it definitely stirs deep.Mystery: Absolutely. This is one of those rare films where the mystery lasts long after the credits roll - -Final verdict: 7.5/10. See it! -AP3-",Black Christmas

There are no laughs here as this is as serious as horror gets. This is what is so good about it. The creepy phone calls really set the mood leading towards the intense and petrifying scary ending. This is a very good and well-polished but still gritty stalker horror. The killer is always hidden. There aren't many jumps in the film, there doesn't need to be as there is this impending sense of doom that lingers throughout even after the intense ending. Very good horror film.",Black Christmas
108,Rautus,A very chilling horror movie,10,31 May 2007,"Black Christmas is one of the creepiest slasher movies I've seen in a while, for starters this film did make my skin crawl especially with Billy's phone calls. The atmosphere of the house and attic was also creepy, Bob Clark did a good job creating the suspense with the camera shots for the killers POV just like John Carpenter's Halloween, the acting is good from all the cast.The scenes with Billy are intense when he phones the girls because he's reacting his childhood while also saying other things, this slowly lets us understand the character and why he's killing people. I couldn't wait to hear the next phone call from Billy to see what he said next to them because they really are creepy.This film is a real classic 70's horror movie that really sends a chill down your spine. 10/10",Black Christmas
109,Rrrobert,"OK, but overrated",7,1 January 2021,"Mostly well done chiller with elements later re-used in the better-known Halloween (1978) and When a Stranger Calls (1979).Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, John Saxon do some good acting. The locations are well used and the suspense builds well. The tense final segment is effective.Bob Clark later did teen sex comedy Porky's (1981), and there's much Porky's style comedy here. However it weighs the film down and dampens the suspense. The gags of Mrs Mac having booze hidden everywhere, Barb (Margot Kidder)'s jokes about turtles having sex and the fellatio telephone exchange, and the character listed in the credits as 'Laughing Detective' who acts accordingly, seem try-hard and drag on too long.Also weakening the film are the unbelievably dumb cops. The detectives openly mock dim Sergeant Nash (Doug McGrath) yet the detectives also screw up so badly it becomes distracting. The most obvious blunder is never properly searching the house even though Clare is still missing. There are big logic lapses. After threatening calls and a local murder, characters go back to joking like there's no danger. Even if Mrs Mac really would leave while a student is missing, no one reports her not arriving at her destination or tries to inform her of the murders in the house. Near the end the boyfriend (Art Hindle) of the still-missing Clare, and Clare's father, sit casually chatting beside the catatonic Jess (Hussey).

Near the end of the movie, the guy who was nothing but a Saint is killed and takes the fall for the killings, but the real killer is still lurking about the house and they never found the one girl who was killed with the plastic bag who still sits in the attic.

He takes up residence in the attic of a sorority and picks off the girls one by one. One of the first killer in the attic films, it was scary for the early 70s and is one of my favorites. Many well known actors had their first roles in this film. There are continuity errors and some obvious scene remakes, but overall a good film for the time period. Some masterful camera angles. The dialog was ripe for the time period, but quaint these days. This is one of the few scary PG rated films (except for language) that can get you going. One of the best parts of the film is the calls from the killer and the demented dialog. Very creepy.",Black Christmas
112,hokeybutt,Might Have Been Impressive Way Back When... But Kind Of Old Hat Now...,4,29 July 2004,"BLACK CHRISTMAS (2 outta 5 stars)I remember that this movie was a big deal (at least in Canada) back in 1974. It was a huge hit and audiences raved about how scary it was.  This was a slasher movie that pre-dated Halloween and Friday the 13th... it probably didn't seem as cliched then as it does now.  In fact, a lot of scary movies that came out later sure seem to have been influenced by this one.  Young women in a large, spooky sorority house are plagued by weird, obscene phone calls... and then mysteriously they start to vanish, one by one... victims of a crazed psycho killer (sound familiar yet?)  The movie is competently-made... but the acting is very uneven.  SCTV's Andrea Martin plays one of the sorority girls and it's a little difficult to accept her in a ""straight"" role... as accustomed as we are to see her making fun of movies like this.  Margot Kidder plays another of the girls... the wild, outspoken, rebellious one (might as well have a target pinned to her back... dang!) The rest of the actors are Canadian performers of varying degrees of competence.  Some of the scenes are suspenseful... even if some of the goings-on defy logic and/or common sense.

113,TwistedContent,Has Always Remained My Favorite Slasher,9,1 December 2019,"I'm not even sure what sequence number can I assign to this year's re-watch, but what I am sure about though is that ""Black Christmas"" still remains my favorite slasher of all. Bob Clark did a terrific and highly creative job, and got hated back then, but eventually, deservedly it became a cult classic, and, more importantly, a huge influence to the genre - beginning with John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" which, in early stages, was meant to be a sequel to ""Black Christmas"".It's a bit of a slippery topic, about wether it's a slasher or not, but I made up my mind the first time I watched it - it is. What makes ""Black Christmas"" so enjoyable is the simplicity of the production, there are no over-the-top kills, no goofy chase scenes, no unintentional humor. Instead we get presented a contained, straight-forward, but unnerving story that's rooted in reality. The atmosphere feels pseudo claustrophobic and vulnerable. Bob Clark takes his sweet time to build the story, the characters and create suspense - by general slasher standards I'd deduct that ""Black Christmas"" is quite the slow-burn, but trust me, it's a value instead of a flaw. Despite an awfully tiny budget, ""Black Christmas"" feels polished and confident. The entire cast is almost unexpectedly terrific, with Olivia Hussey and John Saxon being the highlights & Marian Waldman provides a warming and healthy humorous character as the Sorority house's mother. The villain, the killer, mostly portrayed in back then extremely rarely used POV style, is just perfect for a slasher flick. The ambiguity surrounding him is all the character needs & his terrifying voice is an icon on its own. All the while the aforementioned qualities keep the movie going smoothly and creepily, even visually, given the budget, it's very creative - mad props to the cinematographer.""Black Christmas"" is, without a doubt, an overlooked movie if not also underrated. I might love it more than most of its viewers, but I'm telling you, it's a landmark in the horror genre that still has the ability to provide enough kicks. My rating: 9/10.",Black Christmas
114,Gafke,The Original Lost Slasher Film,9,29 November 2003,"3 years before ""Halloween"" forever changed the horror film genre, ""Black Christmas"" was the original slasher film...and what a weird-ass film it is! There is a killer hiding in the attic of a posh sorority house, a killer whose face we never see and whose motives are never revealed. The film begins almost immediately with the sickest, most obscene phone call ever put on film. It's not so much what the caller has to say (although, for 1974, it's pretty graphic, sickening stuff!) but how he says it; his (or her?) voice changes with every sentence, sometimes two or three voices overlapping each other. It is indeed a chilling thing to hear, reminding me very strongly of Reagan MacNeils Legion of voices in ""The Exorcist."" The call ends with the mans voice, now speaking in a normal (but no less frightening) baritone, informing Margot Kidder that he is going to kill her. The spree begins almost as soon as the call ends.All of the characters are rather offbeat, and all of them suspect. Olivia Hussey is the surprisingly non-virginal and newly pregnant heroine. Keir Dullea is her moody and slightly obsessive piano playing boyfriend who refuses to allow her to get an abortion. Margot Kidder is the drunk, rude sorority sister with a mouth only slightly less foul than that of the obscene caller, who continues to phone and torment our confused and increasingly frightened Miss Hussey. The girls continue to disappear, but no bodies are ever discovered and no one has any reason to climb up to the attic, where a display of horror awaits. There are some ingenious killings here: a plastic bag, a hook on a rope, the glass horn of a unicorn, all very wince-inducing. The climax obviously went on to inspire ""When A Stranger Calls"" and can be appreciated anew here.It's not a flawless film, however. I personally hate ambiguous endings. I want to know who did it and why, and although it really is not necessary (real life killings oftentimes have no motive and the killer no history with his victim, after all) it still left me feeling irritated. I also had a serious problem suspending my belief when, at films end, the cops simply leave our heroine alone in the house to sleep her drugged sleep. True enough, they think they have caught the killer...but the girl is in shock, she's just committed a murder of her own (albeit, one of supposed self defense), and I'm supposed to accept it when they turn off the lights and just leave her there? What the hell? Okay, reshoot the last ten minutes or so, and I'll stop griping about the fact that we never find out who the killer is.I'm not sorry I watched it, if that's any consolation to you hopeful horror fans looking for some lost oldies but goodies. It's a good film. It could have been really great, but just fell a few inches short, that's all.",Black Christmas
115,skybrick736,Black Christmas (1974) 10/10,10,26 March 2015,"Black Christmas is ultimately one of the most under-appreciated horror films in the horror genre and really a pioneer movie for the slasher genre. The beginning of the film is terrific since it really takes its time setting up characters and the unseen psycho, inside the sorority house, almost like a chess match. Bob Clark did a fantastic job with the casting and character development. Oliva Hussey and Margot Kidder was what steered this film forward with their fine performance and natural attractiveness. John Saxon, who most know from A Nightmare on Elm Street, had a major role and was also top-notch. Perhaps my favorite part of the movies though is the psycho phone calls that the sisters get. Many films have tried to duplicate the phone calls, but none have been able to match the insanity and effectiveness that Black Christmas achieved. I could rave forever about Black Christmas, even the ending, which many people may not have liked; I thought it was definitely a good way to end an incredible horror film.",Black Christmas
116,bob_meg,True horror is a mood...and nothing is moodier than this,10,28 December 2009,"Really good horror movies stay with you for life.Any idiot with a camera can pull you into a one-off scare with a ghoul's mask and a horrendously loud stab of music, but it takes real chops to pull off something as cumulatively horrific as Bob Clark's 1974 indie masterpiece. Watching it is like being at the center of a really macabre jigsaw puzzle that keep getting more forbidding and gruesome until you realize the last piece has your name on it.There are many exhaustive reviews (deservedly so) on this site that detail the plot, so I'm going to summarize the pieces of the puzzle that make it such a delight to return to time and again.1) The Sorority House - Just one look at this thing could send you running for the hills the way Clark, Art Director Karen Bromley, and DP Reg Morris have portrayed it. A look at the house in the daylight without the ominously warped lenses, dreary lighting, and blanketing snow reveals nothing remotely forbidding. But the thought of having to stay overnight there, as it's portrayed throughout the bulk of the film, with the majority of the occupants gone on winter break...chilling stuff. It's a character unto itself.2) Carl Zittrer's score - Quite possibly the most effective horror music soundtrack ever composed, it's a wonder for several reasons. It's economical. It uses what it needs to when it's needed. Zittrer tore up an old piano and raked the strings with a variety of odd objects, neatly echoing male lead Keir Dullea's avant garde mashing on the keys, when the character wasn't brooding ominously. Then there are the ghostly carols: ""ooohs"" and ""aaahhhs"" bent, slowed-down, sped-up, played backwards until they're ready to send you over the edge. Turn out the lights and turn up the volume on the newly remastered 5.1 soundtrack and watch your skin crawl.3) The Phone Calls - My god. Hey, there are a ton of menacing phone call movies, but nothing like this. The caller in ""Black Christmas"" doesn't just pant or moan or blare obscenities....he does all of this and more. ""Could that possibly be ONE person?"" Lynne Griffin's Claire asks the other girls early in the movie. It's a valid question, because the caller seemingly has a background soundtrack going while he's going out of his mind. Was he using a tape player? Probably, but who really cares? The point is this: the guy is obviously OUT OF HIS MIND. He's not trying to threaten, he's not trying to scare or pull a prank. He's merely letting the contents of his demented psyche loose in a torrent that's loaded with the organized chaos of a Jackson Pollack painting or John Zorn track on steroids. He laughs, screams, and sobs...many times all in the span of five seconds. The jarring vileness of these (many) calls was really toned down in the TV cut (""A Stranger In the House,"" which is how I first saw this --- and even hacked to pieces for late night TV it was disturbing - NBC would run it near the holidays in syndication after SNL, I remember).4. ""Wrapped in Plastic"" - Way before Twin Peaks, Black Christmas played with the idea of a killer ""preserving"" his kills with transparent casing. This is particularly morbid when they're stored in the attic of the house you happen to be occupying.5. The Totally Canadian Humor - With as much gloom and doom as BC has going for it, you'd think it would never make you crack a smile. But then again, it has two of the funniest, least self-conscious actresses playing supporting roles: Andrea Martin and Margot Kidder. And the late great Marian Waldman has the role of lifetime as a uniquely foul-mouthed, hard-drinking housemother who keeps bourbon in the toilet tank. And need I mention Doug McGrath's bumbling Sergeant Nash? His performance generates laughs and pathos simultaneously...he's a rube you can't help but pity, in a nice way.This film has an impressive fan base, and yes, it did fail when it was originally released. I hale from Peoria Illinois and it even hit our theaters a bit softly....but....the theater owners were shrewd enough to bring it back each Christmas for a limited late-night run. Why? because they knew it scared the crap out of the few who DID see it.It still does. And what better endorsement can you give a horror film?",Black Christmas

The calls grow increasingly more macabre as the film moves on. Soon, a girl in the sorority goes missing, and everybody goes on the search while the calls continue. There is a killer on the loose, and as time moves on, he grows more and more blood hungry...Black Christmas isn't the best slasher movie ever made, but it's the movie that started it all, and for that it deserves respect.Black Christmas borrows it's basic plot from the most famous urban legend of all time, and adds a bunch of characters and plot developments to make it more interesting. The plot is pretty good for a low budget slasher movie, and it's still creepy today. Many of the devices used in most slasher movies came from this film including the point of view shots and the tension building silences. Though Halloween started the slasher boom of the 80s, it wouldn't have been made the way it was had it not been for Black Christmas, and fans of Halloween should recognize that. The movie uses many creepy build up scenes to build tension and makes the smart choice of never showing the killer's face. We only get to hear his deeply disturbed voice through phone calls, and an eyeball through the shadows. It is especially creepy that we have no knowledge of the killer's identity or his motive, however a motive can be put together by anyone with an imagination through the phone calls. Bob Clark, who went on to do the famous Christmas film A Christmas Story, did a very good job with this film.The acting is pretty good. Keir Dullea gave an intense performance, and Canadians Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin were both funny and dramatic.Overall, Black Christmas isn't a great classic, but it was the first slasher movie ever made, and it is the reason that most slasher movies are the way they are.7/10",Black Christmas

Movie had some problems with pace and setting of story. Till the end of the movie, you don't know killer's intentions and most, importantly his identity. Hiding the identity is good for suspense but by the end nothing was cleared. Everything should have been shown step by step just like Halloween which helped audience to feel what's happening with the main lead but that was not the case with this one.Overall, by reading what I wrote above don't think that the movie is bad.

One is a perverted voice, the other Billy; and someone named Agnes. Barb( Margot Kidder) answers the phone, and she just laughs it off like who cares. Claire ( Lynne Griffin) who is leaving for the break to meet her father, doesn't take it lightly, leaves to finish packing upstairs. While packing she is suffocated with a plastic bag, and taken up to the attack. When Claire's father comes the next day and explains she didn't show up; red flags are raised. Jess( Olivia Hussey) gets Barb, and Phil(Andrea Martin) to file a report at the police department. The first time they go the Desk Sgt. Nash( Doug McGrath) doesn't take it seriously. When a girl is murdered in the park close by and the calls are still happening, Lt Ken Fuller(John Saxon) gets involved. The calls still come and this time they seem personal like only someone close to her would know.Jess, has her own problems, especially how will she tell her boyfriend Perter(Keir Dulla) she's pregnant. She goes to the conservatory, and tells him she wants an abortion. When she tells him he flips, he is high strung and orders her around. He's control freak who is threatening; and could go off like a firework . When Jess gets back she gets another call, and it sounds so much like Peter; that it's chilling. Peter is weird he sneaks in the house to take a nap, and approaches Jess like a creep. When I first saw this movie I thought Peter was the killer, but who's Billy? While watching this movie I notice that the killer wears the same clothes Pete wears. I also think he and the killer look alike, i.e. when Barb gets killed the killer resembles him to a T. I do think he made some of the calls from the upstairs phone; because he was in the house at the time she receive one.That one she got got the phone company involved. When Jess was on the phone to the police Peter started down the stairs. Jess had no idea he was there; and too me that's a little unnerving.When a tap is put on the line on the two phones downstairs. Lt Fuller and lineman Graham(Les Carlson) tells Jess in order to catch the person, she needs to keep them on the line. Phil has a talk with Jess before she goes to bed. Jess thinks it could be Peter, but isn't sure. Phil gives her some advice, then goes to bed. Ten minutes later a call comes in, and they get the location. Sgt. Nash phones Lt. Fuller and tells him the calls are coming from inside the house. When Nash calls Jess and tells her the news, she warns Barb and Phil. When she discovers they have been murdered, and the killer is still in the room. Jess fights back and escapes to the basement. It's about two minutes later, Peter shows up and knocks on the basement window. He eventually gets in, but Jess doesn't trust him. She ends up killing him with a fire poker. Afterwards when they find Jess, people in the background think he is the killer or is he? I loved this movie especially the joke on Sgt. Nash. One thing this move has in it is a little comic relief, especially the Fellatio joke on Nash. There were others, but that one had me going for awhile.I didn't see this movie until after the re-make came out, the original is always the best. Too me I think there could have been two killers Peter and Billy. Peter was just so creepy, and was always around when someone was killed. The whole sneaking in the house to take a nap; WTF-WHO DOES THAT/? This is a fact, this movie is a must see. If this movie doesn't give you the creeps, check your pulse.",Black Christmas

I was pretty blown away at how good it was. I was expecting it to be good but I was also expecting a good amount of cheese because it's so little known. However, it wasn't cheesy at all and it is still terrifying to this very day.I thought the story was incredible. It's really simple but it accomplishes so much and instilled a lot of fear in me. I've heard a lot of people say how Halloween ripped this movie off and I don't see that. I definitely see how Halloween was influenced by this film but that doesn't mean it isn't its own film and a great one at that. I would call them equal films. Both have great stories.The acting was very good and the characters were portrayed very well. The atmosphere is probably the creepiest part about the film, it was executed so well. This is definitely one of my new favorite movies and I am bummed that I waited so long to see it.Every horror fan owes it to themselves to see this movie immediately. It is essential not only to see, but to own as well. And remember, if this movie doesn't make your skin crawl, it's on too tight!",Black Christmas

This year was no different and I have decided to review this old favorite once and for all.The ambiance is genuinely creepy and the Christmas theme being used in a horror movie is upsetting to see. I would not recommend this one to kids. ""Black Christmas"" is one of the first true slasher movies. A killer is on the loose and stalking members of a sorority house. We are not sure who it is and the ending is shocking. The killings are brutal. It's crazy to think that the guy who directed this went on to do such hits as ""Baby Genuises..."" He should have stuck to horror! Highly recommended classick that will sit with you for awhile after viewing. And avoid at all costs the Michael Bay remake for that is absolute garbage and just a sorry attempt to cash in on an awesome movie that DID NOT NEED TO BE REMADE.9 out of 10, kids.",Black Christmas

123,MovieGuy01,Good creepy movie!!!,7,16 September 2009,"I watched this film last Saturday evening. I thought that i was far better a movie than the remake of Black Xmas(2006). The actors were way better than in the remake. The film seemed to have a much more creepier feel to it. i really liked how the camera work was done which made it feel that you were being followed through the house. I think that it is best to be watched late at night with the lights out for full effect. I thought that there was good amount of gore in the film. as well as having a a good psychological feel to it so that you are on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen. The killings were done well especially one one with the girl having been suffocated with a plastic bag.I recommend this film for fans of all the 80's slasher films. such as Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th (1980. You should feel quite afraid after watching this film (Enjoy!!)",Black Christmas

Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder (also look for Andrea Martin of SCTV fame) star as two residents of a sorority house that is emptying out as Christmas approaches. The atmosphere is jolly and carefree, except for an ongoing series of menacing telephone calls, and, oh yes, we've just seen someone climb into the attic with apparent ill intent. Kidder does some scene-stealing as the bad girl, Hussey illustrates one of the downsides to having beautiful long '70s hair, and Keir Dullea does a nice turn as the creepy boyfriend. Director Robert Clark knows that the unseen is far scarier than what can be seen and he ratchets up the tension beautifully, making good use of ominous shadows, and putting in nice touches like replacing the sound of a distraught woman's scream with the piercing ring of yet another ominous phone call. This is a terrific, well-made little movie that is genuinely sleep-with-the-lights-on scary. Don't miss it.",Black Christmas
125,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,A classic 70's mystery horror slasher film - Olivia Hussey is the best slasher heroine,10,9 December 2019,"A classic mystery 70's horror slasher film one of the best slasher films that evolves around Christmas hollidays. Black Christmas (1974) is one of the most influential slasher movies of all time. John Saxon is this movie from a A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) My Favorite Horror Movie of All Time. Black Christmas I watched now the second time around I like this film a lot. The ramake I watched the first time around I like the ending a lot more than in this movie. The ending is kind a chilly.In my theory I think there were two killers I know that Peter Smythe (Keir Dullea) was the killer because he broke in to basement and it is weird that this guy knew where Jess suppose to be. I think they were 2 killers since Billy could not kill Jess, Peter decied to kill her.The story takes place in a sorority house on Christmas hollidays, where the residents are throwing a Christmas party before they depart for the summer. Little do they know, however, that a perverted killer has made his way into the house, and is preparing to pick them off one by one. The movie was inspierd by a classic urban legend of a babysitter who learns that the threatening calls she's receiving are coming from inside the house. It was a movie called When a Stranger Calls but I hate that film, I prefer the remake.Actress Olivia Hussey as Jess Bradford the heroine did a great job a wonderful believable performance I love her. I wish there would be more fight in the film with an assaliant on the end of the movie, but it is what it is. The kills are brutal, great effects, grousome death scens. Margot Kidder dies in this movie I wasn't happy about this. Olivia Hussey is a bad-ass she really did a good acting performance. The actress deserves more. Jess Bradford deserves to be one the best survivors out there. I love this my mstery great slasher film. John Saxon was great as Lt. Kenneth Fuller.The second remake is coming this Friday out and I can say the second remake will suck! I watch the trailer it will have nothing to do with the original except the title. It is Rated PG-13 as a family film so it is not worth it to see it. Black Christmas 70 movie is a cult classic. Bob Clark and A. Roy Moore the both helped developed the story in the remake. They bot did a grest job. In the movie Billy is preferening Billy and Agnes what they did. Really psycho, creepy and scary. In the park they found 13 year old girl probably Billy's first wictim. Clare Harrison (Lynne Griffin) disappeared. The killer was stalking her than he killed her with a plastic bag. You see her body stahed in the attic. He killed Mrs.
MacHenry and he stashed her body too. Phyl and Barb are both killed.I will never understand why horror movies like Black Christmas the original classic are not made anymore. They are not made. I love the remastered version. I love the phone calls that sorority girls recieve. This movie is really great constructive. So I have been talking a lot about this movie it deserves a proper review. I don't own this film in my collection, because it is over 40 years old. I download and I saved the film on USB key so I can watch it whenever I want.I like this movie a lot Olivia Hussey is the best heroine she deserves a great recognition. This movie gets 10/10 R.I.P. Margot Kidder your missed I love her in Superman I and II. That is my review of Black Christmas more a Black classic movie.",Black Christmas
126,dommercaldi,"Far Superior To The Feminist 2019 Remake, But Still Bad",4,27 May 2020,"Pros:
1. The first-person view of Billy (Albert J. Dunk) helps to imbue more tension as it feels like you're the one stalking the victim.
2. Albert J. Dunk delivers a fantastic creepy voice-acting performance.
3. The does a really good job at cementing the horror atmosphere.
4. The last 20 minutes are captivating, intense, and thrilling. It's a shame this only happened towards the end.
5. The film keeping the identity and physical appearance of Billy shrouded in mystery, helps to increase the tension, suspense, and intrigue, as you're constantly trying to guess who it is.
6. The shot of Billy's eye through the door crack is utterly terrifying and bone-chilling.Cons:
1. Most of the acting performances are very wooden and flat.
2. There are quite a few useless characters as they are given nothing to do. Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman), for example, is only there to be a drunk.
3. The comedy is massively unfunny. The fellatio gag is presented as the height of the humour, and it's awful.
4. The film is needlessly slow-paced, especially after the first kill where very little happens.
5. The dialogue is clunky and is often used to spew out forced exposition.
6. Most of the characters that die are either unlikable and/ or uninteresting. This makes it hard to care.",Black Christmas
127,squirrel_burst,"Other movies have borrowed heavily from this holiday horror film, but there's a reason for that",9,30 December 2014,"It's ironic in a way. ""Black Christmas"" predates pretty much every single slasher horror film (including the one I consider the first in the genre, ""Halloween"") but you can see so many elements in this film that have been borrowed or distilled into familiar horror tropes that at first, it will seem kind of routine. For this reason, you might be wondering what the big deal is about if you're just a casual movie viewer. There's a lot more to it than just an ancient ancestor of your ""Friday the 13th"" and your ""Prom Night"" though. It goes without saying that if you're a true fan of horror cinema, this is a must-see. The plot, as you might expect happens on Christmas Eve/Day. It follows a group of sorority sisters who are stalked and murdered by an unknown killer hiding in the attic of their sorority house. Sounds basic? In a way it is, but it's the details that make this movie stand out.As a fan of horror movies, I have a great deal of admiration for this film. I enjoy seeing the beginnings of the horror genre. The cast of characters gradually being reduced in numbers as the movie comes along, the building tension, ""the final girl"", the various kills and the escalating terror as the sorority sisters slowly realize that there is something very wrong happening. It's like looking at the skeleton of an ancestor to Tyrannosaurus Rex and looking at what bones are going to gradually turn into which ones and what traits were deemed unnecessary so they were dropped until the creature in front of you became this legendary killing machine. From a fan of horror films, this historical aspect ranks about 3rd on my list of ""favourite things about Black Christmas"". I'll get to #1 in a bit, but my #2 isn't the familiar aspects. It's the sort of precursors to some of the familiar tropes in slasher films that are quite different in their primeval state. For example, the main character in the film isn't very clear at first. Are we going to be following the killer? Is it going to be Margot Kidder's character, the sarcastic, drunken girl who appears to kick-start the plot? Usually the protagonist of the film is ""the virgin"", so maybe it will be Claire (Lynne Griffin), who leaves the party early when she is offended by Barb's lewd remarks? Maybe it's Jess (Olivia Hussey), the recipient of the obscene phone call that is our first clue as to who the killer might be? Just as there are some points in the film where your familiarity with slasher films will help you deduce some developments, the fact that this movie doesn't adhere to many of the clichés (because it predates them) makes it often unpredictable and unconventional as far as films of the genre go. You'll be surprised to learn, for example, that the killer in this film does not have a signature weapon, that we don't really learn a lot about who he is and that there's really not much blood in the film. Just when you think you've got this movie figured out, it throws you for a loop, and I like not knowing where a plot is going to go.You're probably wondering what the main appeal, my favourite thing about this movie is. Well, it's the fact that the film is genuinely frightening. There's a very naturalistic look about the film that brings home the terror. The movie doesn't begin with a fresh face going to college for the first time and being introduced to a slew of characters, some of which act funny from the start to indicate they might be the killer later. It starts at Christmas time. All of these characters know each other, they're all busy doing their own thing, and it's like you're coming in uninvited to peep in on the action (in a way that's similar to the killer). When we hear the phone ring and learn that it's a strange man making lewd phone calls, and that he's been doing this for a while, it's not really a grandiose shock to the characters, they've heard it before and yeah, it's creepy, but it's not a big deal. It really feels like these people have a life outside of the events of this movie. We hear several off-hand remarks of other crimes that have happened around the campus, and we have no way of knowing if they're connected to this plot at all. This helps make the identity of the killer even more mysterious. Has he been murdering people for a long time and he's just now coming into contact with these sorority sisters? Is this the first night and the other events are just coincidences in the same way that you have coincidences all the time in real life? A lot of it can only be guessed because like the characters in the movie, you don't really get big bits of exposition explaining the who, the what and the why of this plot. This lingering uncertainty as to what exactly is happening, and why, makes the conclusion of the film incredibly intense and unsettling. There are images of the killer that spook me every time I see them.""Black Christmas"" is a movie that does suffer because it has been imitated so much, but there's a reason it hasn't been forgotten. It has some really genuinely frightening scenes, a lot of tension and also several humorous scenes to throw you off. I really like the comedic moments because just like in real life, when you get genuinely scared you do manage to find little nuggets of humour to try and steel yourself. You have probably heard some things about this film and wondered what the big deal was about, but watch it again, really watch it and I think you'll agree that it really is something special.

128,Jacques98,A perfect slasher if not for the bloated subplots.,5,6 September 2008,"It's hard to write a review for Black Christmas. On one hand I thought much of the movie was a pathetic attempt at an emotional slasher film, and on the other hand there were scenes that were some of the best kill/scares in the history of horror movies. It's almost like Black Christmas flirts with perfection then jumps back to lame subplots. Yes, I understand that this film literally invented the slasher genre, but, no, I cannot call it perfectI can only call certain aspects perfect.As I said, the main standout flaw is the complete lack of focus. The movie starts out in a sorority house, but from there jumps to a lot of other places to focus on characters and subplots that don't really matter to the story at all. The whole subplot of Clare's father coming to the sorority house was completely pointless by the end of the film, and just takes away from the actual story. The subplot between Jess and her boyfriend should have been cut much shorter, in order to, once again, focus on the actual story. Most of all, the subplot of the missing child still has nothing to do whatsoever with anything else in the film. I don't understand why the director takes 20 minutes to go into it, when in the end, like all the other subplots, it is nothing important. It could have easily been a passing reference instead of its own section of the film. The police scenes, also, added nothing to the story except take away from the amazing atmosphere. Everything the police scenes added could have been done with phone conversations, instead of taking up half the movie time to show things the audience could have guessed. Without all these subplots the movie would have been much, much more effective and tense.Another problem I had was the title of the film is Black Christmas, but other than the opening and one of the death scenes, nothing in this movie referenced Christmas at all. Most of the time there wasn't even snow on the ground. It would have been so much more emotionally effective if it played into the Christmas nostalgia more than it did, but the movie made the ability to play Christmas songs more of a gimmick than a plot point.Though I'm being negative with almost every aspect of the film, I really did enjoy part of itthe actual story. When the movie isn't trying to have five different subplots that go nowhere, the actual core story is done to perfection. The killer, the kills, the girls, the sorority house, the phone calls, the endingall truly perfect, and by far the greatest slasher of all time. It's sad to see what is really a beautiful minimalist horror story turned into a bloated crime drama with more pointless subplots than kills, and that is the only thing holding this film from perfection.Overall, I wish I could go in and just watch the actual plot happen in Black Christmas, but I can't. Still, as much ranting as I did, there is something there that makes it better than so many movies that I've rated higher. Something that Hollywood forgot four decades ago. Maybe it's the fact this movie has very little blood, but is still very effective. Or, maybe, it's that the core plot was actually thought out, truly terrifying, emotionally captivating, and also something original that had never been done before it. I think that is it.4/10",Black Christmas
129,marcus_stokes2000,A Christmas As Red As Blood,9,4 December 2006,"*Black SPOILERS* Christmas Break; most of the Pi Kappa Sig Sorority girls have already gone back home for the holidays, but a few are still in the house, and begin to receive chilling phone calls by an unknown person, and after Barb (Margot Kidder), a drunkard Sorority Sister, disses him, he says calmly 'I'm going to kill you' and hangs up.One of the girls, Clare (Lynne Griffin) is scared, and mocked by Barb, she decides to go pack, since she's leaving the next day for home with her father, but she is lured by the caller in her closet and suffocated with plastic wrapping, and her corpse is put in the attic (where the killer hides) on a rocking chair, with a doll in her lap.Her father obviously doesn't meet her, and worried (but somehow worried more at the decor his daughter used in her room) he calls the police.And as the Pi Kappa Sig's housemother, the alcoholic Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman) 'goes missing' also, and the calls become increasingly frightening, the sorority sisters, which include Barb, the pregnant (and planning an abortion) Jess (Olivia Hussey) and the geeky Phyllis (Andrea Martin) begin to realize the danger in which they are in, but is it too late? Not many know of this movie (yet), especially where I live (Italy), where it's rare to find (until Dec. 5, when the DVD is going to come out... I hope), but it's a real treat for horror movie lovers, and it takes you back to a time where Final Girls were still believable, the horror movies were thought out and original (heard that, Michael Bay?), and suspense, not gore, was a priority.The obvious inspirer of 'HalloweeN' (along with Italian thrillers 'Profondo Rosso' (1975) and 'L'Uccello Dalle Piume Di Cristallo', (1970) which also use the technique of the killer's POV), 'BC' conserves intact the power to scare you silly with a very simple storyline and almost no blood.The actors (which other than the above mentioned include Keir Dullea, Art Hindle and John Saxon) are also really great, and there is a subtle sense of humor throughout (just a quote: 'These broads could hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa if they could get to the top of it!'), and let's admit it, Christmas has always been a little *too* cheery, hasn't it?

130,Aly200,The Original Holiday Slasher Film,8,12 February 2017,"Haunting, dark, atmospheric and suspenseful are probably the best adjectives to describe director Bob Clark's underrated horror film. Before there was ""Halloween"" in 1978, four years earlier came this terrifying slay ride (pun intended) from the man who would give us ""A Christmas Story"" in 1983.Set in a sorority house during the Christmas season, a group of young women are stalked, taunted and mercilessly seen by an unseen madman living in their house's attic. The tension only escalates as the girls are picked off one by one and the phone calls are garbled insane gibberish, filling the film's main heroine with dread as she becomes the 'final girl'. Can she and anyone else survive the terror of the night?The film's cast is impeccable from Olivia Hussey plays main protagonist, Jess, to Margot Kidder (four years before she would become Lois Lane) as the foul-mouthed Barb, Andrea Martin as levelheaded Phyllis 'Phyl', Keir Dullea (best known as Dave Bowman in '2001 a Space Odyssey') as Jess's unhinged boyfriend, Peter, and John Saxon as the policeman assigned to watch the town and ultimately solve the murders. The cast displays a quirky chemistry and genuine sense of mistrust as the tension ramps up in the narrative.The story is simplistic in its narrative: murders occurring in the sorority house and everyone is under suspicion. However the film is original in its format with inventive techniques as POV shots from the killer's perspective (soon to be overused in later horror films), obscene phone calls that taunt the surviving girls ('Scream' would borrow the phone call angle, but put its own spin on escalating tension) and a limited use of violence in order to scare the viewer with what is not seen rather than what does happen. Most audiences and critics were unsatisfied with the film's ending as there are questions left unanswered, but this makes ""Black Christmas"" so different from its successors as it begs us to wonder what happens after the credits. Any horror fan should definitely see this little gem and I promise it'll haunt your dreams.",Black Christmas
131,marymorrissey,EXCELLENT PERIOD PIECE not just for the month of December!,10,20 December 2010,"Andrea Martin! * * Margot Kidder * * John Saxon! * * Some old guy you see on TV all the time who plays the old geeky guy all the time!! * * Listen I'm sorry, I wouldn't say that the performances are good...at all at all atoll!!! They are pathetic, in fact! All the way down the line!! Do you hear me?!?! PATHETIC! Indeed though, sure 'twas that it was the case that these gals and guys without exception ""didn't have much to work with"". In fact I think looking back that aside from Andrea Martin perhaps, all the characters single and in to-to reminded me viscerally of those dimwitted folk who try the patience of detectives Joe Friday and Bill Gannon on ""Dragnet"" starring Jack Webb forcing the fuzz to raise their eyes to heav'n on numerous occasions so provoked by the half witted dimwitted of LA are they as they go about their ""beat"" investigating crimes. Not just the good citizens, look you, of this campus town but the peace officers themselves are equally unintelligent leaving it to the audience - you and me - to roll its eyes a la Joe And Bill in this Canadian production entitled, ""Black Christmas"" but when I saw it in the theater when it originally played I believe it was called ""Silent Night, Evil Night"". Only with R rating: brace yourself to hear profanity aplenty in this motion picture! Ms. Kidder also does some lewd tongue things. In fact the least nasty of the bunch is probably the heinous killer who has some story to tell about Agnes and Billy which as many other reviewers have indicated, comes off less as an attempt to terrorize than as some little kids intending an attempt to entertain (however feebly!) or kids making ""prank"" calls and struggling not to laugh as an accompaniment or kids dead set on simply sending ""everything but the kitchen sink coming down the line"" as one reviewer comprehensively put it.On to accentuating the positive: The color is very richly saturated and the set design and lighting are nothing short of lushhhh, like Barb (Margot Kidder)! As a result, while you'd probably be making a mistake to date any of these sorority sisters, you'll make no mistake dating this picture: this is 1974 all right in all it's glory, with fashion palette ranging from mod to retro and in fact what makes this film really juicy is the heady flavors of '74. Why you can almost hold the aroma in your hand which emanates from the chicks of patchouli, rose oil and from the dudes English Leather, Brut and the like with which you'll be juggling the stench of blood, egg nor, the house mother's ""B for Booze"" which - charming if hardcore woman that she is, this broad drinks from out the toilet without any kind of rinsing of the bottle I guess she figures if it's a battle to the death between e coli and her saliva she's nothing to worry about with the egg nor, Xmas tree, various other fixings, etc. and the booze the other girls are drinking too, cause the house mother is by no means the only one drawing refreshment from the ""tis"" punch bowl! Kier Dullea is an evil conservatory composer/pianist whose blatant atonality and extended techniques while one would hope could convey a sense of menace yet even sweating and squirming on the piano which is practically smashing literally to bits during his performance he puts the jury assigned to hear his recital to sleep. Philistines! This movie is so funny cause of its 1974 vintage with all the young women being so potty mouthed, each wanting to be more outrageous and provocative than the last. well at least two or three of them would give any woman a run for her money in a contest for which of them is the sauciest lady of them all, verbally/orally that is. Visually though you may find yourself musing, ""I wonder who put up the poster that is the ""peace"" sign made of the pelvis and legs of a man and woman - the woman's are spread as the man appears to penetrate her from above, his legs tightly clamed together. By today's admittedly different standards it is the female of the species, aside from the ""bespectacled"" (as the reviewer who spoke of the kitchen sink called her one - i.e. Andrea Martin) one and maybe a couple of the others who bent over more in the direction of soft spoken, who would be charged with sexual harassment in this day and age! Is this a sorority house or a museum of erotic art? The place is, as a rule choka block with knick knacks - carousels, a collection of glass swans, etc. Ah the good old days! Were they so good?!?!?! ""Black Christmas"" raises this question without doubt.Well for one I was disappointed not even to see a composer credit in the credits for the spicy piano music. The IMDb indicates that the composer recommended sexy John Saxon for the roll of the top cop. Wouldn't it be funny if this composer actually in this instance proved to be the first cause of Mr. Saxon doing the many and various copious cop rolls he was eventually fated to you might say specialize in - let's call it of course a sub-specialty of cop in horror rolls! The last 2 shots were kinda cool. I didn't ""get"" who it was outside, I guess another ineffectual cop and why he didn't react to the phone ringing!! I'll give it a 10 for being an outstanding ""time capsule"" cause it really is more interesting in this way than many another bad movie or even good! :)",Black Christmas
132,meathookcinema,A Masterpiece,10,24 December 2018,"Whilst it's widely thought that it was John Carpenter's Halloween that initiated the slasher genre those who actually know anything about horror know that it was actually Bob Clark's Black Christmas made in 1974. In fact, Clark and Carpenter worked together on a project after Black Christmas was made. Clark said to Carpenter that he no longer worked in horror but that he had had an idea for a horror film that was never realised. This would be based around the occasion of, you've guessed it, Halloween! Carpenter then later asked to use the idea for a film he was to due to work on and the rest is history. This isn't to say that Carpenter ripped off Clark but this explains how The Babysitter Murders (the original idea for Halloween) suddenly morphed into the masterpiece we now know and love.In fact, the opening shots of Black Christmas are similar to those of Halloween- the killer's point of view camera shot. Halloween reveals who this person is (and it's one hell of a reveal) but Black Christmas doesn't. In fact, the killer isn't revealed fully throughout the entire film which is the first reason that Black Christmas is so revolutionary.The story involves a group of female students on the night before they leave their sorority house to go home for the holidays. They start to receive very disturbing phone calls and things start to get dramatically worse soon after.Another reason to love Black Christmas is that the extent of the killer's mental instability is shown by the first girl he kills. She is suffocated and then placed in a rocking chair in the attic where the psycho is hiding out. Throughout the film we see him ranting and manically rocking her.Arguably some of the most disturbing sequences within the film are when the intruder calls the girls. They don't know the calls are actually being made by the killer who's in the attic within the same house. From the calls we come to learn that the person making them is called Billy and that he seems to be playing out incidents from his past, incidents rife with cruelty, abuse and possibly murder. Bob Clark used five different actors for the calls. These phone calls are some of the scariest, most disturbing and unsettling sequences I've ever seen in a horror film. They were even cut when the film was first released in the UK.Theres also the fact that Black Christmas was the first film to use the now established trope of a killer's phone calls coming from inside the same house as their potential victim(s). This was years before When A Stranger Calls.Another great thing about the film is the humour contained within the movie especially from Margot Kidder's character, Barb. It's amazing that such an unnerving film can still have genuinely funny interludes but without forsaking the movie's tension.But maybe thats because the film is extremely tense indeed. Theres a certain sense of doom to the proceedings that are depicted in the movie. A great example is where Olivia Hussey's character Jess has just found out that the calls are coming from the sorority house, that Billy is ensconced within it but so are two of her friends (the audience knows otherwise as we saw them get dispatched earlier). On going upstairs (even though the police have phoned and demanded that she leave the house immediately) she enters one of the girl's bedrooms to discover their dead bodies- and the killer looking at her through a crack in the door. This sequence is one of scariest in horror history.Add to this one of the most warped endings I've ever seen in a horror movie and you have a masterpiece.Theres only two horror films with the ability to give me sleepless nights. One is The Exorcist, the other is Black Christmas. Essential.",Black Christmas
133,Toronto85,Black Christmas,10,25 December 2012,"A psychopath stalks young girls at a sorority house during the holiday season in ""Black Christmas"". This Canadian made horror movie is by far the best of it's kind I've ever seen. It falls under the categories of ""killer is in the house"" and ""holiday horror"", therefore is compared to such classics as 'When a Stranger Calls' and 'Halloween'. The thing is that Black Christmas was made before both of those, yet never got recognition over the years. The plot is pretty simple. A group of sorority sisters get obscene phone calls around Christmastime. It all seems fairly harmless until we see one of the girls murdered and then stored in the attic by the killer. The rest of the characters go to the police to report her missing. After receiving more disturbing phone calls, the cops tap the phone to find out what location the calls are coming from. As the movie moves along, we see a few more people murdered leading to the shocking scene in which the lead character jess is told that ""the calls are coming from inside the house"".The plot sounds simple and has been done to death in eighties slashers, but Black Christmas TRULY does it best. So many things about this movie are done so right. The caller is not your average deep voiced creeper. His ramblings range from high pitched squeals about ""Billy and Agnes"", and get even more twisted towards the end. The sounds the killer makes when he's alone with the dead bodies is so unnerving, I've never watched anything like it. The suspect list is short and really only includes the boyfriend Peter. We see throughout the film that he is a very troubled guy and you really start to believe that he is the caller/killer.Despite this being a creepy horror flick, there are a lot of laughs especially from the character of Mrs. Mac (Marian Waldman) and Barb (Margot Kidder). Mrs. Mac is the house mother who loves her booze and loves her cat Claude. She has to be one of my favourite horror characters of all time. The acting is top notch from Waldman and Kidder, but also from our leads Olivia Hussey/Andrea Martin/John Saxon/Keir Dullea. Black Christmas is one of the most frightening and terrifying horror films of all time. It's got the premise of a slasher flick, with out the blood and gore. It uses shadows, creepy phone calls and a mystery in the story that leaves us in fear and with many unanswered questions. This film by the brilliant Bob Clark should be seen by all!10/10",Black Christmas
134,shadowman123,Black Christmas =Merry Xmas...,6,25 December 2007,"Whilst I was continuing on anti-Xmas crusade what better movie then to cap of the festive celebration with none other than Black Christmas. I bought the DVD a while back ago assuming that it was the 2006 version but by looking at the trailer thank god I got the original version and not the 2006 teen trashy version! Not much over here that is new but you can that a movie like this was the one that would set the 'rules' for future horror movies and slasher flicks. The movie goes straight into the action and does not waste in any time , although it does tend to drift off in a few places the good part was that we introduced to a tense atmospheric moment which but the tone right again. There also some genuine creepy moments that stand out and the odd funny moment here and there . There are also good uses of camera which helps dramatically to its quality and really make this movie stick out. Olivia Hussey was undoubtedly the star of the show but having said that Margot Kidder was amusing and John Saxon's performance was worthy as well. To conclude although Black Christmas did not exactly make my skin crawl , it did however jump out moments and also the fact that it annoyed some bible thumping Evangelical watching this makes me more happy as I hate Christmas and this movie just feels like a kick in the balls to old Santa, one definitely for horror movie fans who can do with some decent horror during this 'cheerful' holiday.BLACK Christmas: 6.8 OUT 10IF THIS MOVIE DOES NOT MAKE YOUR SKIN CRAWL ...

There is one stretch towards the end of the movie that is suspenseful, but it peters out.The way in which the movie is made is very good. The problem is there are no characters to give a hoot about and no real story within which to involve them.It's not unique; it's not engaging.It might have been a good drive-in movie to snuggle up to a date.

136,lthseldy1,Very creepy movie..... don't watch it alone,7,15 December 2002,"This movie was very creepy and it reminded me of Fulci's movie ""New York Ripper"" in the way that the pycotic caller would call up after he would kill his victims with all kinds of wierd strange noises that sent shivers up your spine.  This movie was about a sorority house that becomes victimized during Christmas after an obnoxious prank caller would call up each time he would kill his prey.  The only problem with this movie that I have is it does not release the identity of the killer.  The boyfriend of one of the tenants had me fooled for awhile but at the end it left me guessing again.  And who is Billy?  Otherwise... I would highly recomend this one to anybody that likes a good scare, but don't watch it alone, this kind of crazy stuff is something that could happen anywhere.",Black Christmas
137,BloodTheTelepathicDog,Top-Notch,8,2 May 2011,"A top-notch horror film from the 1970s, Black Christmas' only drawback is that it occasionally drags. There are a handful of times that you wish things would speed up but perhaps Bob Clark is just building the suspense, because once things begin to happen you'll be far more ensnared than you'd otherwise be.The story concerns a sorority house where the girls receive prank calls from a psycho. When Clare (Lynne Griffin) goes missing, her father (James Edmond) shows up to locate her. Since Clare didn't make it home her sorority friends grow more concerned with the obscene caller and wonder if he is to blame for Clare's disappearance. But Clare's loss is just the beginning as the girls get picked off one-by-one.STORY: $$$$ (The script is really quite strong. Characterization is not forfeited for blood and guts in this tight little slasher. Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea play a couple who bicker over her pregnancy, Margot Kidder is a lush who seems to be following in the footsteps of their alcoholic house mother Marian Waldman. You will like these characters. Suspense is in large supply as well. Director Bob Clark has a knack for placing you on the edge of your seat and then giving said seat a swift kick at the right time to jar your senses).ACTING: $$$ (The acting is generally strong along the board. Genre favorite John Saxon is terrific as usual in the role of the town sheriff but he is upstaged in the acting department in his own precinct by Doug McGrath as Sergeant Nash. McGrath masterfully portrays the rube desk sergeant who is the butt of every joke. The scene where Margot Kidder leaves him the sorority house' phone number is a riot! Keri Dullea is effectively pompous as Olivia Hussey's emotional unstable boyfriend and Miss Hussey shines as the mother hen even though she opts not be a mother. Art Hindle, man-fur and all, does a fine job as Clare's jock boyfriend while Margot Kidder gives one of her best performances as the crass Barb).NUDITY: None",Black Christmas
138,Casey-52,"Not a slasher film, but the one that started it all!",10,8 July 1999,"I watched this movie after much searching through Mom & Pop video stores and found a pristine copy. It scared my pants off! BLACK CHRISTMAS is one of those movies that is an unsung classic and is most appreciated by horror buffs. I tried to get my friends to watch it, but they are all into gory, graphic horror opuses like SCREAM and URBAN LEGEND. Unfortunately, those movies have very few scares and are just cheap rip-offs posing as tributes to great films like this one. There really isn't anything to complain about for this movie unless you don't like movies that rely on suspense and hinted-at violence.One reviewer said this movie wasn't a slasher movie because BLACK CHRISTMAS wasn't gory enough. The gore in slasher movies is what ruined the entire horror genre. BLACK CHRISTMAS, HALLOWEEN, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the older films rely on suspense, mind-numbing suspense and require your imagination. People are spoiled by the gore effects in films now, sometimes the effects are gratuitous and don't move the story along at all! BLACK CHRISTMAS' story moves along briskly, dragging the viewer into it, making the movie seem so real! Horror buffs should appreciate the fact that BLACK CHRISTMAS attempts to ""befriend"" its audience instead of ""ripping its guts out""!",Black Christmas
139,smellthecult-com-1,Slasher classic,5,25 October 2009,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, in the main because I have read from several sources that this was massively influential on Halloween, the John Carpenter slasher classic. I have to say, though, (and I'm not proud of this) that I found this to be very boring throughout. There's some good POV work, which I guess is the inspiration behind many of the similar scenes in Halloween, but overall it's all a little too soap opera, with endless scenes of Sorority dullards wittering senseless prattle. I must confess that the film has one of the finest taglines I've ever read: ""If this film doesn't make your skin crawl...it's on too tight."" Pure quality.I don't know, maybe I was expecting too much, but this just left me a little cold.",Black Christmas

It's a fun slow burn horror film and this is before John Carpenter HalloweeN film came out. The story is good, the acting is great, and the script is good. The phone calls are down right disturbing like it's better than the remakes phone call. Yeah this movie is a pre Scream world at the time but it's effective still. The kills are creative but the sad part about this movie is that it's forgetable like not alot of people know this movie. This is my review on Black Christmas (1974), a forgetable underrated classic.",Black Christmas
141,FKDZ,The slasher before the slasher era.,7,9 June 2021,"This is kind of a incredible film for 1974. It's a well wrapped movie with some all round decent performances. The plot is simple yet very effective and I don't think I've been scared of a killer in a genre like this for a while. The acting, mostly voice acting for the killer is chilling. It's really emits the sense of insanity above anything else. After watching so many horror movies, I can't believe I thought the things that I did. Especially the later sections of the movie really grab onto you.Now as for the beginning, the movie starts off pretty much right away and is very engaging at the start. Then it does get a bit tedious and drawn out around the beginning-mid section which is probably my least favorite of the movie because nothing really happens.Regarding gore this film has a very light amount. But stil enough disturbing images, especially the ''second'' kill Clare is done very effectively. So for its age, it still did a great job at being somewhat scary. Also what really helps this movie is that its pretty barebones, no special fx, no crazy plot. It's very grounded and real. One of the only caveats is the amount of plotholes and characters that ''need to be alone''. Though it wasn't that annoying. I guess the main offender in this would be Phyl.Barb was one of my favorites throughout this film and seemed to be the lead in the first part of it, Jess gradually took over and became the lead girl which was an interesting shift. That said, Barb was one of the only ones that had some comedic relief in her dialog, though I still think this movie lacks in that department. Most of it is very dry and serious.As with many slashers, the killer is important, but not here. You're not gonna know, its completely kept to your imagination. Which in this case definilty works in favor.The cinematography and directing is honestly really good as well, filled with moments where as a viewer you get real claustrophobic with slow zooms, and long ended shots. One of my favorites is of course the final scene with Jess in bed.That said this movie suffers mostly from some annoying plotholes and ''convenient'' events.All in all this is a must watch for slasher fans, and will still be pretty thrilling if you aren't one. 6.5/10.",Black Christmas

It sounds like a unoriginal slasher but this movie is unique different than any other slasher, and the movie itself is what started slasher movies. The soundtrack is great, the shots are amazing, the characters are good and likeable and aren't as dumb as a rock like in most horror movies. The deaths are brutal and creative. The movie has some great turns and twists it takes, and left me guessing, and the end reveal and is amazing and the end shot to the credits is one of the greatest movie endings of all time. This is a true masterpiece and is criminally underrated. MASTERPIECE 10/10.",Black Christmas
143,lagriff05,"Classic horror, see it now.",10,30 December 2008,"Here's the one I watched on Halloween but couldn't understand due to all the ruckus going on at the party. And now that I have sat down and watched it properly, I see exactly what makes this one such a classic.Black Christmas is one of those old school horror movies that knows what it's doing, unlike mostly every horror movie that comes out these days. The build-up is long and it sets a tangible mood - this is not a movie trying to rush itself into the blood and gore, which is not really one of the focal points of this movie anyway. Yes, there are stock characters, and there is some thin human conflict going on between them, but you actually care about these characters, and you don't really want to see them die. What a novel concept, right? This makes it all the more disturbing as the stalker's phone calls escalate in insanity and as the bodies begin to pile up. The acting is really good for these kinds of movies, too, with great performances from all of the characters.And goddammit, those phone calls get really, really creepy! I mean, I know what you're thinking; ""oh, wow, a phone call, how can that be scary,"" but no, it is scary. I won't spoil the reasons why for those who haven't seen this gem yet, but the atmosphere of the whole thing is blackened, haunting, claustrophobic and memorable as Hell. This is all very believable, leaving no room for anyone to laugh and pan this movie off as unrealistic or silly. This could happen to anyone! And that, in a similar manner to Halloween, is perhaps the scariest thing about this movie.From before a time when horror equated to ridiculous special effects, gory amputated limbs and torture chambers, Black Christmas hits you hard no matter where or when you watch it, with a ferociously creepy mood, a calculating, dark atmosphere and just enough pizazz to have you looking under your bed this Christmas eve to make sure that there aren't any bogeymen coming to get you. Highly recommended.",Black Christmas

The film is so real, sometimes you will think it's based on a true story. With a tight, sold script, laser focus direction and great performance from the cast giving grounded, real characters, coming together to make Bob Clark's Black Christmas a instant classic.
The script plays with the audience expectation by the characters actions and a faceless mysterious antagonist in putting us on edge of wondering and guessing what going to happen next and the film will deliberately will leave us with unanswered questions.
On a side not, the film overall message is the most pro choice message I ever saw in cinemas in my life without being a pro choice film that just preaching without any creativity.",Black Christmas
145,iago-6,Christmas bells are snoring,3,2 June 2006,"When the remake of When A Stranger Calls was out, obviously I was interested in watching the original. Then when I read about the original (which I recall had my sisters totally freaked out back in the day) I saw that the real money is on Black Christmas, which apparently beat everyone to the ""the caller is in the house"" punch. So I Netflix that, and it sits at the top of my list for months due to its ""very long wait."" All this time I am getting more and more eager to see it! Then one day, out of the blue, it finally arrives! ...And it's a total snore.Sure, maybe I had elevated expectations, but I don't think it would have gained more had I seen it fresh. The thing is it's Christmas in some Canadian college town, and there's this sorority having a party. We see some killer-POV shots as he climbs this trellis and sneaks into the attic. So we KNOW he's in the house. Then we're introduced to our characters-Olivia Hussey as the mousy, whiny, Canadian-accented Jess. Margot Kidder as the annoying, overtly aggressive alcoholic Barb. She's so annoying even her mother dis-invites her for her Christmas festivities. There's also this irritating Janis Ian clone (""Phil"") and this alcoholic den mother Mrs. Mac, seen taking nips from the various bottles of booze she has stashed all over the house. We also meet Jess's highly-strung boyfriend Peter, played by Keir Dullea of 2001 and Bunny Lake is Missing fame, though halfway through the film I was still asking myself ""Which one's Keir Dullea?""So it seems that the house has been receiving obscene phone calls, but this was before email, so they couldn't ask him to send a photo. Then-well, you know how they say those plastic dry-cleaning bags are not a toy? One of the sisters finds that out the hard way. Don't worry if you don't catch the first 14 shots of the plastic-encased corpse face as it reposes in the attic-there'll be 28 more interspersed throughout the film, obviously there to make you say ""Oh my God! There's a corpse in the attic!"" Though after the first hour that changes to: ""How come the dumb police haven't found the rather prominently-placed plastic-encased corpse in the attic?"" Especially as it is made abundantly clear that it is clearly visible from outside the house. Really, any time before CSI came on the air must have been such a golden age of crime; the cops are so dumb. Fortunately some of them look like John Saxon.Anyway, after a lot more darn boring human drama, the house mother fears that her precious kitty has ascended a vertical ladder and has pushed open a heavy-looking trap door that rests atop it (those wily cats!), for she sticks her head in there and ends up with a hook pulley in her neck for the trouble. Now we have two corpses up in the attic-hey, why don't we have 75 more shots trying to chill us by the fact that there are now TWO corpses in the attic?So by now the police have begun to take the situation seriously, and tap the houses' phone and station a cop outside. They inform Jess and her pal Janis Ian that if the obscene caller calls back, they need to keep him on the phone. Jessica, who has grown even more whiny, mousy and annoying keeps asking the caller ""Who is this? What do you want? Who are you?"" after like the first 89 calls, when it is clear that he is not going to answer her. Isn't that like a sign a developmental disability? The inability to learn from unsuccessful attempts at something? And what's he going to do, suddenly say ""Oh yeah, hi, it's Bob from the Laundromat?"" Dumb Jess.Spoilers! Anyway, soon Janis Ian and Lois Lane (Kidder) are piled in bed with ketchup splashed on their faces (this film's idea of gore), and idiot Jess realizes that not a single door or window in the house is locked. Hello? Are you being stalked or what? Then the cops realize that the killer is in the house, and call Jess and tell her ""don't ask questions, just do as I say walk to the front door and get out."" So what does moron Jess do? Starts screaming ""Phil? Barb? Phil? Barb?"" Hey, great idea sister. Now why don't you go right upstairs where you know a psychotic killer is lurking? Of course she does, and sees her former friends, all splashed with ketchup, prompting this viewer to scream at the screen: ""Have a clue now?!""Now, obviously one needs to be understanding and realize that this movie was made before the classic slasher movie tropes were solidly in place, and that it doesn't move to the same pace we're used to, and seeing a plastic-covered corpse in the attic like 206 times probably WAS scary back in the day, and people weren't used to being stalked by psychopaths, so they wouldn't think to, you know, lock the doors or windows. And they might be tempted to wander upstairs when they have just been told that a rabid killer is up there. You see, people were stupid back in the 70s. We have to understand that. One of the big shocks is that we don't even see our proto-Final Girl kill the psycho. But believe me, that fact is more interesting being read in this review than sitting through the movie for.

146,HorrorFan1984,Black Christmas,10,19 May 2020,"A seriously disturbed man stalks girls at a sorority house over Christmas break. It is sure to a very Black Christmas for most of them ...The film opens to the POV of a prowler outside of a large Victorian house which is a sorority house for women attending classes at the local university. He crawls up an outside ladder leading to the open attic. A bunch of the sorority sisters meanwhile are having a holiday party downstairs. After a terrifying and crude obscene phone call, one of the girls goes upstairs and is murdered by the prowler with a plastic bag and put in the attic to sit by the window.Our main characters include mostly the sorority sisters - Jess, the film's fiery heroine, Barb the house drunk, Phyl the level headed intelligent one, and Mrs. Mack, the house mother who is our comedic relief character always looking for booze anywhere she can find hidden around the house. After a few more phone calls, the killer starts coming out from his attic to attack the girls left at the sorority house during winter break. With only one girl left alive, will the killer be stopped or is she destined to be murdered?Black Christmas might be the best horror film I have ever seen. I rate it so high not only for it's quality, but for setting the tone of my favourite subgenres - the killer in the house and the slasher film. Pretty much every one that comes after this has used elements from this story. When A Stranger Calls and Halloween definitely found inspiration from this terrifying classic. Black Christmas still does it best - I have yet to see a film that musters the whole ""the calls are coming from inside the house"" routine the way that Bob Clark did in 1974. The moment that line and truth is revealed, the viewers heart sinks with the realization that our characters are in serious danger.The filming locations are set in my hometown of Toronto. I recognized most of the places which was nice, including the police station in the east end and the University of Toronto campus. The house they used is actually the film's biggest plus for me. Not only is the exterior eerie with the winter winds blowing and snow on the ground, but the inside is equally creepy with turns and dark corners and that attic where the killer hides out. Super effective location to make a movie like this.The acting is so superior for a horror film and for a low budget film like this, very unusual. Olivia Hussey is our final girl Jess and she plays the heck out of the role. She is such a strong female lead and is a unique one with her noticeable British accent. Marion Waldman as the house mother is one of the best things about Black Christmas. This lady is constantly seeking out small bottles of Sherry that she has hidden around the house, and is constantly grumbling around the place clearly so over her job as the head of the house. Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin are the supportive female characters and both were perfect for their roles.Everything about this classic is so creepy to me. The obscene phone calls are so manic and crazed that I still get goosebumps thinking about them. The murder scenes are well done, but it is the shadowy figure coming out from the attic each time that sets them up to be as effective as they are. The thing that is always talked about is the ending and how up in the air it is when it comes to figuring out the killers identity. Following an amazing chase scene involving Jess and the maniac, we are left to wonder who the actual killer is. Was it Jess' neurotic boyfriend, one of the other frat boys we see, or some crazed maniac who is perhaps named Billy? We never find and probably never will.Black Christmas is a film to be seen by all and should be studied by any horror director who is looking to make a movie in this genre. It is a perfect masterpiece.10/10",Black Christmas

The killer sneaks into the attic of the house. Soon after, the girls start to get creepy, insane phone calls. They don't realize it's from the attic. In their own HOME! Soon after all of them are murdered.I loved this film and it honestly kept me tuned in to watch the rest. It's like your watching Halloween (1978) all over again.

148,babyjaguar,BLK XMAS: AN OVERLOOKED FILM,9,13 May 2020,"This is considered a cult, classic and protoslasher, all the terms popular with fans and scholars of genre and slasher filmmaking. It's obvious being made in the mid 70s that the Italian Giallo (POV shots) was popularly used and Bob Clark's earliest entry with Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things also had influence on this film.The innocence of Jess, played by Argentinean Olivia Hussey (real name Olivia Osuna) was perfectly cast opposite of her sorority sisters, like loud-mouthed Barb played by the late Margot Kidder and the outrageous Marian Waldman as the house mother! Supporting actors such cult veteran star, John Saxon and Crononberg's The Brood leading actor, Art Hindle.The rest of the interior location are excellent in creating (although the house is insanely large) claustrophobic and dark. Strong dubbing of the murderer's voice still create a distrubing chill today.Roy Moore wrote this script in his late 20s Bob Clark was not a beginner,he was building a grouping of filmwork. This film precedes the similar plot twists of Halloween and When a Stranger Calls.

Soon the calls lead to murder as an intruder breaks into the house and starts killing off the girls who have not yet left. Now its a quest to find the killer before everyone is dead. Margot Kidder gives a wonderful, hilarious performance as the perpetually drunken sorority member. And Olivia Hussey is worth seeing as well for her solid performance. One major thing that should be noted is that this movie preceded Halloween by a good four years, and it seems obvious now how that movie was influenced by this one. Further, unlike later horror movies, the heroine isn't a near saint, rather she is just as imperfect as the other characters. Overall this movie works on many different levels and should definitely be seen by fans of the genre.",Black Christmas

Keir Dullea plays a possibly disturbed pianist, who is also Hussey's boyfriend. The setting at Christmas time with all the lights, snow, coldness, is well-presented.

Also known as SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, directed by Bob Clark of PORKY'S fame, this one involves psychotic killer who hides in the attic of a sorority house and starts killing off all the ""girls"", one by one.  
I say ""girls"" because most of them look over 30 instead of 20, especially Margot Kidder as the slutty one with the foul mouth.  (Check out Brian DePalma's SISTERS if you want to see Kidder in a terrifying role)The film does just fine until the last 15 minutes or so when Olivia Hussey goes upstairs to look for her friends and doesn't follow police instructions to leave the house.  What a dumb bitch.  Anybody who is THAT dumb deserves to be killed.It's also pretty obvious 40 minutes into the film who the killer is, but director Clark tries to pull a fast one at the very end of the film by implying that it's not him.  It looks like Clark wants to have it both ways, casting doubt upon the whole thing and trying to leave it open-ended like he does.  There's no gore being shown and very little blood, making the whole thing look pretty tame by today's standards.   In fact, the only thing missing is the ax-wielding Santa.  But no matter folks, that'll come in a later film.The Critical Mass DVD has filmographies for most of the cast along with a short, uninformative interview with Saxon that doesn't reveal much of anything, and no extras from Bob Clark.

153,boyinflares,Don't Answer the Phone!,9,12 October 2006,"Pre-dating what is generally considered the ultimate Slasher film by several years - the original ""Halloween"" - ""Black Christmas"" is a highly-underrated, and amazing horror-slasher flick which would set the standard for practically every slasher film to follow - from the ringing telephones, the 'don't go upstairs', re-hearings and of course a strong female lead.""Black Christmas'"" strong female lead is the equally underrated Olivia Hussey, whose fantastic accent is a special bonus to her calm and sympathetic character Jessica. While the majority of slasher films all feature a female lead (though there are exceptions like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2"", ""Prom Night 3: The Last Kiss"" and ""Friday the 13th VI: Jason Lives"" which all have a male lead) not every female lead is as terrific as Hussey's Jessica. (Exceptions being Neve Campbell's Sidney from the ""Scream"" Trilogy, Heather Langenkamp's Nancy from ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", Lar Park-Lincoln's Tina from ""Friday the 13th VII: The New Blood"" and of course Jaime Lee Curtis' Laurie from various ""Halloween"").Jessica's resourcefulness, and cool personality makes her a character that you really care about, and the fact that she has various real life stories going on (abortion for example - something I don't think has been featured in a slasher since ""Black Christmas"") makes her a very likable character. The majority of the characters in ""Black Christmas"" are actually very realistic and likable. Margot Kidder's Barbie provides a lot of the comic relief, but has the most tragic death also. Andrea Martin is excellent as frizzy-haired (though its nice frizzy-hair) Phyllis. John Saxon is always great in his performances, and his role as Lt. Fuller is no exception. Keir Duller does a good job of playing perhaps the most unlikeable, but very realistic, Peter, Jessica's over-bearing and high-strung boyfriend. Marian Waldman is a riot as the house-mother for the sorority girls, Mrs. Mac.The plot, pacing and general story is probably nothing new to anyone who has seen ""Scream"" or ""Halloween"", as previously mentioned, many slashers take a least a note or two from ""Black Christmas"", which does everything splendidly. Great direction, interesting camera angles, a couple of good jump scenes, and then there's the telephone calls...perhaps one of the most disturbing things in all slasher movies.So overall, ""Black Christmas"" is an amazing slasher-horror film, setting the stage for a myriad of followers over the years, but thirty years later, does not seem out-dated or cheesy. Sure, there's not a lot of gore, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. And for the pre-cursor to the likes of ""Halloween"" and ""Scream"" to be this good, then it's certainly worth a watch, even if just to watch for all the things in the film that will eventually become standard conventions in slasher films.",Black Christmas
154,Sci-FiHorrorFan,Since its Christmas i thought i'd review this Classic Film Black Christmas.,10,25 December 2012,"This is one of the best horror films I've, seen! and I love it.I feel that this film is underrated and overlooked and some people don't realise how good it actually is.I was very impressed by this film the first time i saw it and it has been in my head ever since. This film has everything,great acting,great likable characters a nice location,and a story that works very well. Since this is such an old film i'm sure that a lot of people have seen it so i don't have to explain much of the story,Its about a crazed killer stalking a bunch of girls at their sorority house on campus and the killer starts killing people one by one. This may sound like your typical horror movie but believe me its Not!. This movie works well because of its atmosphere and its creepiness. I found this to be a very dark and chilling film it was also suspenseful and had some mystery behind it,and i quite liked the mystery,it makes a nice change because most horror films just have a bunch of kills but there seemed to be more to this film than just killings.I guess i just thought this film had more of a story to it than most horror films do. There are a lot of chilling and creepy scenes in this film that will make your skin crawl and my personal favourite was the weird phone calls,i thought they were done well,and the killer spoke in a way that made your skin crawl.he was creepy and his voice was creepy. The actor that played the killer did a good job and i thought this film had some good idea's like the killer hiding in the attic of the girls sorority house i thought that was a great idea and i found it creepy that he was up there watching people out the window and nobody knew he was up there and the heavy breathing from the killer is also very creepy especially when we don't see him.I liked him as a villain and i liked the lead girl Olivia Hussey she was pretty and i found her likable in the film and she played her role well and the rest of the cast were good too.I liked the whodunit aspect of the film and I thought the twist was clever and the ending was effectively Creepy.This is a classic film and deserves a watch,its highly recommended.This excellent film deserves a 10/10.",Black Christmas
155,piratecannon,Psycho Stalks Sisters,6,26 December 2012,"Director Bob Clark is best known for his 1983 film A Christmas Story, the feel-good tale of a child who wants a Red Rider BB gun from Santa Claus. What a lot of people don't know, however, is that Mr. Clark has approached the holiday season from a much darker perspective. And his 1974 slasher, Black Christmas, is surprisingly effective.I'll be completely honest. I expected shoddy acting and lame scares to abound. Black Christmas does have its fair share of the preceding, but it also generates a somber, brooding atmosphere that's heightened by the frenzied piano stylings of a college student, named Peter, who appears to be on the verge of mental collapse. This guy is dating one of the sisters who lives in the sorority house where the bulk of the terror takes place—this comes in the form of harassing phone calls and some odd, funhouse-mirror-style first-person perspectives—and he's meant to be suspect number one. The elusive psycho's identity is never revealed, and it's clear that screenwriter Roy Moore wants us to believe that Peter is, in fact, the bad guy, but some last-second revelations result in the old switcheroo. This, along with a number of other strategies used in Black Christmas, seem frighteningly clichéd in this day and age, but I can only imagine that they were fairly groundbreaking during their own time (okay, so Psycho is really the movie that spawned the modern slasher, but let's at least give credit to a movie that's notably more tense than most of the horror to emerge from contemporary Hollywood).As previously disclosed, this isn't to say that Black Christmas doesn't have faults. Some of the acting—and corresponding character responses— to what's going on in and around said sorority house are completely unbelievable. The father of a missing sister, for example, calmly explores the campus when his daughter doesn't show-up for a rendezvous they had planned early one afternoon. Even after the police get involved and it's somewhat clear that foul play is afoot, this guy never exhibits any urgent sense of emotion to locate his daughter. There's also the presence of a pointless old woman who, for one inexplicable reason or another, lives in the sorority house. She curses and has liquor stashed in books and septic tanks throughout the home. I'm guessing she was meant to serve as some sort of comic foil, but she's more of an annoyance than anything else.That's Black Christmas in a nutshell. Would I recommend it as a cozy little holiday horror movie? Sure. It's certainly not bad, and it has its creepy moments, but don't expect the reinvention (or invention?) of the wheel.",Black Christmas
156,haydenluz,Black Christmas,9,7 July 2020,"Black Christmas, directed and produced by Bob Clark is one of the best Christmas films ever made! Clark used a lot of vetern film making tools to add a lot of depth and mystery to this film. The story was very fresh, original, and stays on track with great pacing. Black Christmas was not only a Christmas classic, but sparked a lot of influence towards John Carpenter's Halloween, Wes Craven's Scream, and Sean S. Cunningham's Friday The 13th, with it's horror elements & tactics.The lead characters were extremely entertaining, showing a lot of pure emotions. The supportive cast complimented the leads well, because they actually had purpose, unlike most supportive characters in horror and/or Christmas films. I like how Bob Clark made the killer a complete mystery; he didn't even let us see his face! The phone calls and actual physical violence he portrays was vicious, and very creepy.The screenplay by Roy Moore was right to the point, and unfiltered, which I can really appreciate for this kind of film. Some dialogues and scenes got a tad stale, but the screenplay was above average, and carried great merit.There was only a few things that I could really nit pick in this film. The story definitely was original and inspiring to other film makers, but I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a few disposable or dry scenes. Other than that, there's other minor things you could fault, but it's not something that would really bring the rating down.Overall, Black Christmas is a must watch every year before Christmas! You will be hooked from beginning to end!",Black Christmas
157,psycho_153,ONE OF THE GREATEST!!,10,23 December 1999,"Black Christmas is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It builds up a scary atmosphere not only blood and gore like other movies. (Friday The 13th) Imagine getting phone calls and on the other end someone is using three or four voices, their comments are sexual in nature, they are filled with profanity and they say I'm going to kill you. (ring a bell, SCREAM) The phone calls are very strange and bizzare and just listening to them gives you the chills (the calls are coming from inside the house). There is also a bit of a who done it, you think you know who it is and then there is a twist. There is violence like all good horror movies, but not too much, there a funny scenes. I especially liked the directing of the scenes with the killer. We don't see the killer but we move with his eyes, and we hear him panting, puffing, and making strange noises. Phone calls were excellent, with the weirdest noises coming from the killer. great performance by the actors. This movie was made before a lot of the other horror movies and many have tried to copy it greatness but failed. WATCH IT!!",Black Christmas
158,chris330r,So boring,1,24 December 2020,"I love horror films, but could only make it half way in before turning this snooze fest off. Too much talk and no horror.

It sounds like a unoriginal slasher but this movie is unique different than any other slasher, and the movie itself is what started slasher movies. The soundtrack is great, the shots are amazing, the characters are good and likeable and aren't as dumb as a rock like in most horror movies. The deaths are brutal and creative. The movie has some great turns and twists it takes, and left me guessing, and the end reveal and is amazing and the end shot to the credits is one of the greatest movie endings of all time. This is a true masterpiece and is criminally underrated. MASTERPIECE 10/10.",Black Christmas

161,dx4lifexpac,it was ok WARNING CONTAINS A SPOILER,8,9 February 2000,"i was reading some of the other comments on this film and most of them say how great and scary this movie is. don't listen to that. i will give this movie one thing it started the horror genre, the way Bob Clark directed it was alot like the way John Carpenter did Halloween, but Halloween blows this movie away, another movie that this is like is Scream with the phone calls, but once again Scream blows this movie away, though i will say the phone calls were good, very strange, my problem with the movie is it is way too slow, put it this way the first hour and ten minutes are kind of a waste, but the final 30 minutes are very good, the concept to the movie is good, the writter fails to bring the goods, it's worth a check though. one other problem i have with this film is you never find out who the killer is. i give it *** out of ***** only cause of the storyline.",Black Christmas
162,zack_gideon,Amazing - the birth of the slasher,10,28 November 2019,"This is from 74, so slashers weren't there yet. I think this film started it. Bob Clark is an incredible director. The film is great. Forget the remakes. Watch the original! :)",Black Christmas
163,thelastblogontheleft,A Christmas gem,8,22 December 2017,"Black Christmas, also known as Silent Night, Evil Night (the title they initially gave it for the first American screenings so movie-goers wouldn't mistake it for a blaxploitation film), is generally considered to be one of the first classic slasher flicks, and apparently even had a hand in inspiring John Carpenter's Halloween. But you might know director Bob Clark from a very different Christmas movie - one that will probably be playing on at least one 24-hour loop on some basic cable channel this week - A Christmas Story.It's a shame that this movie didn't get the recognition it deserved at the time, but it has gone on to become a cult horror film in the years since. It's smart, well-acted, wonderfully shot, terrifying, and even genuinely funny at times.** SPOILERS! **I knew I was in for a treat during the opening shots, moving seamlessly between the inside and outside of the beautiful sorority house and showing POV shots of the mysterious killer making his way around the home (I especially loved the shot of him climbing the trellis). There's a great theme throughout of happy, celebratory, or even just mundane things going on in the house while the killer lurks within... super creepy. I think the whole ""Babysitter and the Man Upstairs"" legend in general is TERRIFYING so the use of it was great - it's one thing to know that the threat is outside trying to get in, but what about when you're locking it inside with you? The search party coming by and almost cheerfully reminding the girls to ""just keep your doors and windows locked and you'll be safe!"" was a chilling reminder.The phone calls were surprisingly scary - and surprisingly vulgar. The killer's alternating between multiple voices/personalities, seeming to scold himself at times, crying, screaming... the calls became more and more frenzied and his incomprehensible fury makes him unrecognizable as even a human threat. There's no way to know his background, his motives, which makes him terrifying in a much less tangible way. We can't relate to him, we can't see our own pain or shortcomings in his motivation, which makes him completely unpredictable and alien.I enjoyed that, aside from the (possibly unrelated?) girl being killed in the nearby park, the main characters don't have any idea that murder is afoot until it's too late. The victims themselves have NO idea, but even Jess (Olivia Hussey) has no indication that anyone has been killed until she finally swings Barb's bedroom door open in the last 15 minutes or so - we're the only people privy to that information.Speaking of which, the kills - surprisingly few, really, considering its status as a slasher film - are all creative and well done. There's no lingering on blood spurting from knife wounds, no over-exaggerated looks of horror that go on for too long, no shirts being ripped open for no reason besides showing a hint of breasts. They're quick and effective but still fun. My favorite is probably Barb being stabbed with her own crystal unicorn grabbed from behind her bed - shot beautifully and the juxtaposition of Jess listening to a young choir singing carols downstairs is just awesome - but the image of Clare in the rocking chair with the plastic garment bag sucked into her mouth is classic for a reason. That reveal definitely got a gasp from me, and the occasional return to the attic - showing his hand rocking the chair her corpse sat in, or her cat innocently licking the bag she was contained in - was a cruel reminder that the search for her was hopeless.There's no denying that there's a strong feminist undertone to the whole film - or, really, far less subtle than that. This movie taking place in the early 70's - and just a year after Roe v. Wade was decided - is important context for its content. Women being terrorized by a dominating and violent male presence is par for the course for countless horror and slasher films, but it feels more relevant here, more close to home. Barb's murder being the most intimate - taking place in her own bedroom, practically in the throes of sleep, with one of her own belongings - was no accident considering we saw her crassness offend multiple male authority figures (Clare's father and a local sergeant, most obviously, but she fights back - verbally anyway - against the crazed prank caller, too).In addition to the more direct threat of the looming killer, we have more pervasive examples of men attempting to silence women in a variety of ways. The bumbling sergeant first ignoring Clare going missing because she's probably shacked up with some guy and then ignoring the prank calls because it's ""probably one of your boyfriends playing a joke"". Clare's father is basically just walking disapproval throughout the entire movie, turning his nose up at Mrs. Mac's language, posters around the sorority house, and Barb's attempts to be humorous in her slurred, drunken state.And, more directly, there is Jess informing her boyfriend, Peter (Keir Dullea), in no unclear terms that she is pregnant with his child and seeking an abortion. Again, the freshness of Roe v. Wade in American society informed his hateful response - ""don't you think about anyone but yourself"", and later ""let's get one thing straight: you are not going to abort that baby"". He's outraged at the idea that she dare make a decision about her own body without his express approval, and is pushed further into his own spiral of deflecting blame when she rejects his very matter-of-fact marriage proposal. He's belligerent to the point of being rightfully suspected as the killer - especially after seeing him destroy that piano after his unfavorable recital.The irony of such gruesome acts being carried out during what is supposed to be the happiest, coziest time of year is constant but not obnoxiously so - it's more something that we notice rather than something that is being told to us, if that makes sense. The warm glow of the colored Christmas lights, the metallic tinsel on the wreaths, the campus emptying out as people scurry off to see their families... it all feels incredibly nostalgic until we remember there's a goddamn psychopath holed up in the attic.Which leads us to the ending, which is amazingly dark, even for a horror flick. There is so often some kind of humanization of the villain, or maybe a dramatic standoff between the final survivor and the killer. We almost get that, or at least we think we might, when Jess is cowering in the basement after Peter smashes his way in. When the police find her slumped over with a dead Peter on top of her, we think there's a chance - albeit small - that the nightmare is over. Jess has not only defeated her would-be killer, but she's defeated this domineering male presence that is trying to control her. But as the camera pans away from her, sedated in bed, and glides by the attic - mumbling and giggling echoing off the walls - and eventually outside, we hear the phone ringing and ringing as the credits roll, and we're reminded that evil often does prevail.Ultimately, a brilliant and sorely under-appreciated film. Go watch it now, get into the Christmas spirit!",Black Christmas
164,pizowell,A slasher great!!,10,25 August 2001,"Black Christmas is the story of a group of girls in a sorority house being stalked and picked off by a psycho.  Sounds familiar.  Well Black Christmas came out long before all the those others and laid the foundation for them. This is the first flick to offer those cool killer POV shots.  This slasher also likes to use the phone, his phone calls give me chills just thinking about them.  This guy is insane!  The slashings are cool and it has a great twist.  Oh yea and this flick is actually creepy.  Bob Clark does a great job creating a bleak atmosphere just right for some slashings.  Bleak, creepy, and really cool.

165,irishboy141,I liked it better than Halloween,9,16 December 2018,"If Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is the grandfather of the slasher genre, then Bob Clark's Black Christmas is the father, spawning/Inspiring John Carpenter's Halloween.While Halloween became a mainstream success, Black Christmas was destined for cult stardom only. Which is a shame because I enjoyed Black Christmas more, and I believe it's a better film.Firstly, all the characters have personalities and little quirks that help keep you more engaged. Theres next to no ""spelled out"" backstory for the slasher villan, most of it is hinted at through the phone calls the girls receive, but he's still intimidating and scary. Also this movie is suprisingly funny. It knows not to take itself too seriously, which helps the horror scenes feel serious and frightning.If you haven't already, I highly recommend seeing this excellent film",Black Christmas
166,Snake-666,The original and perhaps the best slasher film ever made.,8,28 July 2004,"The girls of a sorority house are being tormented by a twisted prank caller who continually calls to convey increasingly vile and abusive sentiments. What at first appears to be a sick joke eventually turns violent for the girls during the season of supposed goodwill and merriment.The original and maybe even the best, Black Christmas' set the ball rolling for the slasher genre and was the biggest influence for the phenomenally successful John Carpenter classic, Halloween' (1978), which was, in fact, originally conceived as a sequel. Although Italian director, Mario Bava, had previously created what some see as the first slasher movie, Bay of Blood' (1971), it was Black Christmas' that was to become recognised as the catalyst for one of the most lucrative sub-genres of horror cinema. Bob Clark (who previously made the kooky, enjoyable, low-budget zombie film Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things' (1972)), still at this point something of an amateur director, took a simple yet naturally frightening concept and turned it into one of the most unsettling and nerve-wracking one hundred minutes in cinematic history. Only a select few films such as The Haunting' (1963) and Alien' (1979) are atmospheric enough to truly equate to the eeriness and feelings of apprehension that are to be induced by Black Christmas'.The simplicity of the production is what makes it so endearing. There are no overly bloody death sequences or unlikely, comic-book style events; the viewer is just presented with an unnerving tale which could easily have a strong basis in reality. Inventive camerawork and POV shots as well as a superlative use of lighting are the elements that combine to achieve the desired results. The often pseudo-claustrophobic environment of the sorority house, from where the vast majority of events occur, offers the perfect, vulnerable and unguarded location susceptible to intrusion and thus attributes to the continual foreboding atmosphere. Clark was not afraid to take time building both the story and characterisation as well as introduce the viewer to the aspects that he would use to build the suspense. This is prepared before plunging the viewer into a seemingly uncontrolled nightmare that one experiences along with the protagonists. Another aspect that firmly stands out is the mysterious way that everything is presented; even at the very end, very little has truly been explained yet everything seems like it should have an obvious explanation. Even in its undoubted simplicity, Black Christmas' has complicated facets that require thought from the viewer to entirely comprehend the film. In some ways, the concealing of several key points puts the viewer's knowledge of events on a par with the actual characters.Black Christmas' is also complimented wonderfully by strong acting performances from Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, John Saxon and a highly pleasant and amusing turn from Marian Waldman. Despite the tiny budget, this is a highly polished horror film that genuinely belongs among the elite of the genre. This is where it all started and those familiar with later slasher films such as Halloween', Friday the 13th' (1980), Slumber Party Massacre (1982) and The House on Sorority Row' (1983) should be able to spot several of the now-clichés that first materialized in Black Christmas'. My rating for Black Christmas' - 8½/10.",Black Christmas
167,alanmora,"""Agnes, It's me...Billy""",10,13 January 2007,"This has got to be one of the most genuinely terrifying movies I have ever seen! There are many terrifying aspects of this film. The soundtrack is horrifying with it's various screams, vocals, and the constant Twang of the piano. The atmosphere is haunting with the various camera angles showing you the killer's point of view and the consistent image of the first victim in the rocking chair with the plastic bag still wrapped around her head flashing across the screen at various moments and then there's the telephone calls. The terrifying screams, moans, and various voices that the killer uses during these calls will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck. The most terrifying aspect of this film though is the fact that you never find out who the killer really is. The viewer is lead down a particular path and falsely believes that they know the identity of the killer but then the film betrays the viewer. This is sheer cinematic genius and one of the essential elements for true terror. This film set the benchmark for future films such as ""Halloween"" ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street""...ESSENTIAL VIEWING!",Black Christmas
168,RomanJamesHoffman,Prototypical and exemplary slasher-film with a realistic and suspenseful atmosphere,8,15 October 2012,"Say 'Slasher Film' and most people will probably say 'Scream', 'Friday the 13th', or 'Halloween'what's more, most will probably be referring to the franchises each of these has spawned rather than have a particular movie in mind. The fact that (despite the inevitable and tired re-make) most people don't know about/haven't seen 'Black Christmas' is certainly criminal as in terms of chills, suspense, and quality of filmmaking it is far ahead of virtually every other film in the slasher genre. What's more, 'Black Christmas has the prestige of being (after respectful nods have been made towards 'Silent Night. Bloody Night' and some Italian gialli) the film which kick-started the genre.As befitting a slasher film, the set-up will be familiar: a group of teenagers, here composed of a group of Sorority girls and a few boyfriends, are picked off one-by-one by a maniacal killer. In addition, other slasher tropes like the menacing phone-calls-coming-from-inside-the-house, the holiday theme, and the (kind of) final girl really do put most viewers in a state where surprises are not to be expected. However, 'Black Christmas' certainly raises itself above the imitations that followed in presenting a realistic and engaging atmosphere which captures the suspense of what is, when looked at without cinematically desensitized eyes, a scary idea: a mentally deranged person killing without apparent motive. The realistic touch comes from the pared down direction which is reminiscent (or should that be prescient?) of Carpenter's approach in Halloween, the time taken to build up a relationship with the characters, the absence of over-the-top Tom Savini-style ""kills"" (which have the effect of distancing the viewer from the fact that someone has died), and a thankful absence of the strained conservative moral message that teenagers should listen to adults and avoid drugs and sex before marriage etc.It is a wonder this film is not more widely recognised. I believe it is due to the fact that it doesn't present us with a tangible figure of fear like Myers, Voorhees, Freddy, the Fisherman, or Ghostface etc who, even though masked, nonetheless localise and personify fear and in doing so suggest ways to combat it. In contrast, 'Black Christmas', apart from a startling eyeball shot, offers us nothing to hang our fear (and our consumerist franchise fetishes) on. As such, while 'Black Christmas' and its killer may not have entered the pop-culture lexicon, this has meant that the film has retained its power and sense of discomfort and maybe, like the killer, the film belongs in the periphery where most people don't look.",Black Christmas

171,Phantasm01,A great slasher film - Sadly underrated,9,5 October 2006,"Horror films have a bad reputation for being completely senseless and lacking a sense of artistic integrity. I'm not going to lie, some of them do fall into that category. However, there are moments in cinema history when you get a film that defines the genre. Something that is so good that it transcends the usual trappings that hold films of its kind down. A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, The Exorcist, Alien, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are just a few of the horror gems that are well made and also very scary.The story is quite simple. At a sorority house, the girls are getting ready to go home for Christmas but begin receiving phone calls from a strange caller who won't give his name. The next day, many girls leave, but one who should have met her father doesn't turn up, which causes great concern for her safety. When another girl goes missing, the police begin searching the area and find a body nearby. Meanwhile, with only three students left in the sorority house, the phone calls continue, getting more and more menacing each time, but unknown to the remaining members of the house, the caller, and perhaps the killer, is closer to them than their nightmares could ever imagine.Keep in the mind that the killer calling his victims before he strikes them practically began here. Some might tell you it started with the original When A Stranger Calls, which was actually released a few years later, and it certainly took place before Scream, which was released in 1996. Black Christmas was the first to effectively use this technique and I must say this film uses it the best. While, menacing phone calls can get tiresome in some thrillers, the calls in this film generate fear and tension with each one that is made. They gradually become more violent and disturbing, to the point that they're almost unbearable. This isn't someone merely playing a game, this is someone with deep emotional and mental problems. The phone actually becomes a character itself because for most of the film it's our only link to the killer. We learn very little about him but what we do learn about him is through his acting out on the phone. I guess you can say the phone is an extension of his character.I also liked that this film believe less is more. There is very little blood and most of the violence is implied. Sometimes a visceral approach to horror can work but I think horror is most effective when they leave a lot of it up to the imagination. Your mind certainly creates a more disturbing image then they might've even shown.Speaking of the killer, he's probably one of the better ones to appear in a film of this nature. The most fascinating thing about him is you don't know anything about him throughout the film. The fact that he has randomly chosen to strike these girls makes him all the more frightening because it proves that sometimes crime is unexplained and completely unprovoked. You never really get a clear look at him, since he's merely a voice on the phone or cleverly shrouded in darkness but he's still a very powerful presence. The fact that he's seen rarely makes his few big ""appearances"" all the more terrifying. I'll provide two pictures of his most frightening exposures in the film and i guarantee when you see it, even after seeing these, those images will still stay with you long after the film is over.Halloween is commonly known for its effective opening scene which a steadycam shot that is supposed to be the perspective of the killer coming upon the house. That technique was made popular in that film but it was used first here and it's actually used often to great effect. The camera is constantly giving you the sense that danger is approaching and it's a very simple but effective technique. A lot of the film is seen from his perspective so it becomes very interesting to view a film through the killer's eyes.No good horror film can work without engaging leads and Black Christmas certainly has a pretty good cast. Olivia Hussy, who at this time was very popular due to her turn as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, is a very likable heroine. She differs from most because she's definitely flawed and is nowhere near perfect but it also makes her all the more human. She's able to carry the film and while she's not the strongest actress around, she certainly handles the task at hand very well. The rest of the sorority girl cast consist of mostly unknowns but Margot Kidder, who would go on to play Lois Lane, is featured as one and quite funny as the booze hound of the house. John Saxon, of A Nightmare on Elm Street fame, appears here as a detective and is always a welcomed presence in anything he's in.Black Christmas is pretty hard to find in stores. I had to get mine on amazon but if you can try to catch this film. It's simple, effective and very scary. It should be given more credit for its role in shaping the slasher genre and maybe with the release of the remake this year, the original will get its much deserved mainstream attention. Check out Black Christmas this Halloween season, you won't be disappointed.",Black Christmas
172,hotrobinproductions,I'm shocked...,9,17 December 2019,"It's a shame I wasn't shown this film sooner. Now it's not really a 10/10 but I'd give it a strong 8 to a 9... but I think it deserves a 10 because of the simple fact that it REALLY is ahead if it's time and influenced not only Halloween but MAN this film was more than ahead of its time. There's no cliche teen sex or even nudity, the characters shine all around the block it's not really one main character that has too much of the spotlight until it starts going down by the numbers. The music isn't as effective say as Halloween but it gets the job done. The sound effects are skin crawling and the ending is the most iconic endings I've ever seen in ANY horror film. I absolutely loved this film and just as I make it my duty to watch Halloween every Halloween I will watch this film every Christmas. Good job Clarke, you have 2 of one of the most iconic Christmas films down in the bag. He invented the slasher genre with this and inspired many to come.",Black Christmas
173,CalDexter,Mind numbing chiller that stays with you long after....,8,2 August 2004,"I remember first seeing this film in the early eighties, i was about six or seven, and horror films have a stronger affect on a child than they do an adult, this film proves it. I was utterly terrified to go to sleep in the dark after Black Christmas, the film's bogeyman is the film's mentality, the audience sees his point of view as he stalks the sorority house where the students are staying and the music is chilling and uncanny, its almost like the killer is an entity rather than a human being, and when he terrorises the girls with obscene phone calls the camera slowly pans over their reactions creating a chilling atmosphere, like the killer's voice is searing into their minds. It's a frightening and scary picture.In January this year though, i bought the film on DVD as a creepy childhood reminder, it has lost none of it's power but now that I'm in my late twenties the effect isn't the same. but i will watch it at least twice every December.

But no sequels though only a crappy remake in 2006 and even that was 33 years after the 1974 classic.The 2006 remake sucks, it tries to hard to be gory and violent when it doesn't look real, so DON'T WATCH IT (unless you want a good laugh at how rubbish it is) 10/10",Black Christmas

176,richard-wheeler,"""It's me, Billy !""",10,20 August 2005,"Black Christmas has been the scariest psycho horror film I have ever seen!This is like an old version of Scream and Urban Legend because the killer is inside the house when he makes these creepy, crude calls.The story begins at a girl's sorority house on Christamas eve when an outsider decided to climb up to a window on the next story and then sneaked into the attic. And then, the creepy, crude calls began.The creepiest moments were when a girl named Claire Harrison decided to pack her stuff and leave the sorority house and suddenly, she could hear someone was in the closet and when she approached it, she was suffocated with plastic and the killer dragged her body through the trap door of the attic. And when morning came, the girls went outside to go look for her, and sitting in the rocking chair next to the camera [ close to the window of the attic] was little Claire with a plastic bag over her head!!! The second one was when Mrs. Quate went throughthe trap door of the attic and before she could do anything else, a hook went through her head! And another was when Barbera ( Jess's friend) was murdered by the killer when he came into her room and got hold of the horn of one of the glass unicorn figures!! And the last one was when Jess thought the killer was arrested and gone, he still lurked in the attic with Mrs. Quate with a hook in her head the cat and strangled Claire Harrison. And then, the telephone rang again.THE COPS NEVER FOUND HIM AND THE OTHER TWO BODIES!!!!!!!!! And Jess and the cops thought that it was her boyfriend Peter who was doing all the murders! To make things sound scary, the killer never shows himself in this motion picture. The only thing we get to see are his light green eyes. And to make things worse, Jess receives calls that came from the upstairs when she doesn't know it. DARN IT! You can hear the victims being strangled, suffocated and murdered!!! You want to know something? Once you watch this movie, you will never want to answer the phone when you have your friends around ever again!

177,Lugo1989,This is where it all began,10,8 June 2018,"The 70's were without a doubt the golden era of horror films. Many brilliant classics have been produced in that time and ""Black Christmas"" is one of them. This is the godfather of all slasher films and rarely surpassed - ""Halloween"" would be on the same level as this one. Some argue that the first ever slasher made was Mario Bava's ""A Bay Of Blood"" which came out three years earlier from ""Black Christmas"". If you are a fan of the genre I would definitely recommend it since it does contain heavy elements common to the genre but nevertheless ""Black Christmas"" has a look that is considered modern even today. It has all the ingredients that make a great horror film: creepy atmosphere, tension that never lets go, nice camera work, eerie soundtrack and a nice mystery. There is even some dark humour thrown in. You will not be bored for even a second. The characters are interesting as well; they are not all your cliche college students which became very common in future slashers. Highly recommended to every true fan of classic horror.",Black Christmas
178,Krug Stillo,Classic Slasher Predating Halloween,9,1 July 2003,"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!After two competent attempts at horror (Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things, 1972, and Deathdream, 1973), Bob Clarke made Black Christmas, one of the first American Slasher films that mixes the Italian giallo genre and the psychoon-the-lose cycle initiated by Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). The results were original at the time, but even today, aware of all the clichés attributed to Slasher cinema, the film is still quite chilling.Set in an old dark sorority house during the festive season, a group of girls are brutally murdered by the raving lunatic that resides within the attic (Margot Kidder among them, who also starred in De Palma's Sisters, 1972, then found success as Lois Lane in Superman, 1978). The film even manages to mix horror and humour involving a buffoon excuse for a cop, Margot Kidder and John Saxon's detective character. The red herrings are characterised very well leading you to wonder whether it's Olivia Hussey's eccentric boyfriend (Keir Dullea of 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968) or the escaped mental patient' that kidnapped and killed a young girl remains a mystery right up to the tense finale. During the film mechanics are used effectively, especially the now familiar caller is inside the house' routine. These are where the scares really lay. The foul-mouthed killer screams abuse at the girls down the telephone, occasionally snorting like a pig and mumbling something incoherent about a boy and girl called Angus and Billy'. The film ends with the fact that it is neither, but a deranged maniac who can only presumed to be Billy.The ending was intentionally left ambiguous for a planned sequel. It is even suggested that Bob Clarke, who then chose to do comedy, allowed John Carpenter to pick it up where he left it. As we all know what finally materialised wasn't Black Christmas 2, but the Daddy of the Slasher, Halloween (1978). This is one of the best Slashers, but definitely gets the award for the best psycho killer at Christmas, leading the way ahead of Silent Night, Deadly Night or Don't Open Until Christmas (1984).",Black Christmas
179,bondgirl6781,"Classic, Non-cliché, Underrated Thriller",9,28 October 2007,"Watching this film gives me the chills! The story is about a killer who breaks into a sorority house and hides in the basement while killing the women in the house. You have Jess (the always beautiful and heartbreaking Olivia Hussey), a young woman facing an unexpected pregnancy and facing up to her high strung, emotional boyfriend, Peter (2001: A Space Odyssea's Keir Dullea). Then you have outspoken, drunk, Barb (Margot Kidder, who is excellent in her earlier role). The atmosphere is perfectly set: like the weather it is cold and chilling. It is a horrible nightmare of the idea that a homicidal nutjob is not only killing but hiding in the place where the murders are taking place. The film has a Hitchcock quality to it and more frightening is that we never see what the killer looks like and we see him killing through his point of view. It is such a shame and an embarrassment that they had to make a remake of this when certain filmmakers in Hollywood are not clever enough to come up with originals. Great thriller: intelligent, disturbing, and amazingly well acted by the cast.",Black Christmas
180,dav07dan02,a Canadian made gem!,8,20 June 2005,"Directer: Bob Clark, Script:Roy Moore, Cast: Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder, Keir Dullea, John Saxon.This is one of my all time favorite horror/slasher/thrillers. It is about a group of sorority girls that are being terrorized by a psychopath. Christmass vacation has just started in this small college town(actually Toronto!) so most of the girls have left the sorority house leaving few behind.At the beginning of the film we see some unknown person climbing up into the house. This,of course, is the killer. The girls start to receive very disturbing phone calls(from inside the house!). This guys voice still gives me the creeps. The girls are not threatened at first. They think it is just some sicko pervert(sorority houses probably get a lot of calls like that!)but the calls get more violent and numerous. Eventually,the girls start to come up missing. When the dead body of a young girl is found in a nearby park, they get downright scarred.This movie has a great cast and a great sense of style. Olivia Hussey was a classic 70's beauty(she became popular after doing Romeo and Juliet). She add class to this movie. Margot Kidder is hilarious as the raunchy fowl mouthed Barbie. That fellatio joke is classic! This movie has some very funny moments but it does not distract from the horror. John Saxon, horror movie icon, plays the police detective. Kier Dullea(from 2001: a space odyssey)plays his rather dry self but it is adequate for the part.We never see the characters face in this movie. It is the atmosphere and the sense of unknown that makes this movie scary. This movie has no real gore yet it has some of the best death scenes in horror. Wait till you see how Margot Kidder dies, it is rather unique! The first girl that he kills he does so by suffocating her in a plastic bag. He then sticks her up in the attic. She is shown from time to time in the the attic on a rocking chair---creepy! This movie also has a creepy ending.This film is one of the greats of the horror genre yet it seems to be often overlooked. The problem might have been timing. It was made right after The Exorcist and and the same time as Texas Chainsaw. I think it got overshadowed by both of these films. No doubt it had a huge influence in the slasher sub-genre that would continue with Halloween and Friday the 13th. Bob Clark is a rather diverse director. He did movies from the teen sex comedy Porky's to the warm family film A Christmass Story. Black Christmass is to be remade in 2006 with Clark serving as executive producer.",Black Christmas

182,eytand94,Black Christmas: A Frightening Holiday Slasher,10,10 June 2011,"After ""Psycho,"" and ""Peeping Tom,"" people wonder whether movies like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Halloween"" invented the slew of slasher films that we get today. But hardly anyone gives credit to a 1974 film directed by Bob Clark that guarantees some serious chills. It's frightening, and weird, and yet, ""Black Christmas"" goes unnoticed. Perhaps the older genre fans have set aside a place in history for the film, but the more contemporary audiences hardly know it exists. This is where my review of ""Black Christmas"" begins.A figure approaches the Pi Kappa Sig sorority house. He climbs up the ladder to the highest window, and isolates himself in the attic. Below the attic door is a party. The sisters of the sorority (including Jess, Clare, Phyllis, and Barb) are enjoying themselves one last time before Christmas break. Many of them are leaving for the holidays while the rest stick around over the weekend to clean house with their house mother, Mrs. MacHenry(also known as Mrs. Mac). But as the obscene phone calls from an anonymous voice continue, and the girls quickly begin to disappear, the yuletide festivities are coming to a close and terror is setting in.Many movie buffs know Bob Clark for his classic comedies ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Porky's,"" but don't let the fact that he directed ""Black Christmas"" fool you. The film is dark, and sincerely one of the scariest movies ever made.As I've stated before, the importance of the film lies within the fact that it was released four years before ""Halloween."" So, which film started the slasher saga? The argument has lasted forever. However, comparisons should not be drawn between the two. They are their own films with their own significance to the horror genre.The ingenious idea of inserting such a happy time of year into a time of fear and despair works extremely well. Since the film is set around Christmas time, the feeling of the holiday is evident throughout. There are decorations everywhere, as well as Christmas trees and snow. Throw the color of red onto snow, and the mood easily changes.Thanks to Roy Moore's script, not only does ""Black Christmas"" have a load of atmosphere, but it is also host to a series of some of the most profane, shocking, and outright creepy phone calls of all time. During the first call, the killer uses very foul language, and when Barb challenges him, his tone changes, and we hear a rather humanly voice simply say ""I'm gonna kill you."" From then forth, we are scared not just for ourselves, but for the sorority sisters also.You see, the characters of the film have such likability. Barb is the life of the party, but she means well. Poor Jess has a struggling relationship with her boyfriend Peter, who joyously accepts that she is pregnant but immediately becomes furious when he finds out that she's planning an abortion. These characters feel real, even when there's some comic relief from the house mother and the police department. You don't want to see them die.Telling from the phone calls, the killer keeps everything under wraps. We don't know who he is or what he plans to do, but he gives himself slight recognition of his identity by simply nicknaming himself 'Billy.' The rest of the time, we never truly see the face of the villain. In fact, we don't see much of him period. When we do feel his presence, it is in his perspective, from his point of view. While he's freaking out in the attic, we're freaking out in the attic. When he's killing somebody, we become him. It's an uncomfortable and horrifying notion, and that's why it works.In terms of acting, the cast is above average. Olivia Hussey (whose star quality was projected in ""Romeo & Juliet"") makes for a terrific Scream Queen as Jess. Also, the early Andrea Martin and Margot Kidder keep things going as Phyllis and Barb. The appearance of genre vet John Saxon as Lieutenant Fuller is also worth noting, as well as Keir Dullea (""2001: A Space Odyssey"") as Peter.All in all, it's a shame that the subordinate remake of this fright-fest got minimal attention and the original film got no attention at all. Thankfully, a DVD release has fixed the problem, and more fans have found a place in their heart for the film. It's still not as popular as ""Halloween"" is, but ""Black Christmas"" is a horror classic. It will scare and shock you, and equally provide you with a healthy dose of entertainment. This one's a must-see!P.S. The ""eye behind the door"" scene still keeps me up at night!",Black Christmas
183,KuRt-33,Sorority girls shouldn't play with mad killers,9,27 December 2003,"Best known for directing ""Porky's"", Bob Clark also directed ""Porky's II"", ""Baby Geniuses"" and ""Baby Geniuses 2"". To be fair, he's also the director of a decent zombie film with an excellent title: ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"". And of course of ""Black Christmas"", a film that has all good films should have: an inspired screenplay, good actors and excellent camera work.Olivia Hussey is the star of the film. She was mainly cast and admired because of her leading role in Zeffirelli's version of ""Romeo And Juliet"". ""Black Christmas"" isn't the weirdest film Hussey is in: you can also spot her in Metzger's ""The Cat And The Canary"", Kinji Fukasaku's ""Fukkatsu no hi"" (a.k.a. ""Virus"") and ""Turkey Shoot"" (a.k.a. ""Blood Camp Thatcher""). You'd almost be more surprised she recently played Mother Teresa. Olivia Hussey is excellent in ""Black Christmas"" as Jessica (Jess) Bradford, the pregnant and terrorized girl in the sorority house. Don't be put off by the fact that ""Black Christmas"" takes place in a sorority house: this isn't the sort of film where scantily-clad bimbos are chased by a maniac with a set of knives. The film actually bothered about something called 'plot' and most characters have (at least a little) depth. A welcome change.Also noteworthy is the camera work. The hand-held camera allows us to look through the eyes of the killer, four years before John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" did the same thing. The cameraman had to climb up and down the occasional stairs, which often looks silly because of a hand-held camera, but ""Black Christmas"" does an okay job here.Back to the cast: Keir Dullea (""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and a handful of cult movies), Margot Kidder (""Superman"" and ""Sisters"") and Art Hindle (best remembered for being in Cronenberg's ""The Brood"", but also in Clark's ""Porky's"" films) are just a few actors in a film where most people do at least a decent job. A special mention should be reserved for John Saxon (who starred in more cult films than one could name), who accepted the role of Lt. Fuller when the original actor (Edmond O'Brien) seemed unfit for the role. Saxon flew to Ontario and rushed to the set, just in time for his first scene (in the middle of the night).One might argue why ""Black Christmas"" needed the subplot of the missing girl, but it's effectively used in a handful of scenes. The naive policeman is there for comic relief, but not the brainless sort of humour one often finds in horror films. If you look at the IMDb message board for ""Black Christmas"" (but don't do that before you've seen the film) you'll notice the film is vague enough about the identity of the killer, which allows the viewer to guess whether the killer is one of the main characters. So is (s)he? For the answer to that question, I refer you to ""Black Christmas"", one of the better horror films of the 1970s. Don't expect too much, just sit back and let the film work itself towards an exciting climax and finale.",Black Christmas
184,rams_lakers,My scary recommendation,7,28 July 2004,"I always recommend ""Black Christmas"" when acquaintances and I are sitting around talking about the scariest movies. Like everyone said (I knew it before reading other reviews) this came out first and the later ""Halloweenish"" flicks copied ideas and atmosphere.My dad and two sisters were watching this on TV when we were kids and I remember my dad would try to scare the hell out of us by staging a fake horrified jump and a cry of fear from his prone position, which sent us all jumping! It was called ""When a Stranger Calls"" (for TV) and they must have cut some of Margot Kidder's lines like ""You f***ing CREEP!!!"" which she says into the phone with such power and conviction that it makes me crack up whenever I hear it. Yeah, I kinda made a sound bite from of it.I still had to grab a blanket, cover myself and put my feet up on the couch when I saw the video release a few years ago. Of course I only make it worse while watching it in the dark. The only other movie that even comes close in creeping me out is ""Omen"" when Mrs. Baylock's face appears as she goes after the mother. A 7 out of 10, this movie ranks in my top 5 of the most frightening ever.",Black Christmas
185,Ziggy5446,"Cold, classy, and straightforward; still manages a good slice of old-fashioned suspense.",7,12 June 2007,"Black Christmas isn't the horror film that started it all. In fact, it isn't even perfect horror to begin with, however, it's certainly one not to be missed. Directed by Bob Clark, creator of the childhood comedy A Christmas Story, Black Christmas is undeniably a somewhat agitated and graphic film for the time it was made. It features above marginal acting as well from Margot Kidder, John Saxon, Keir Dullea and Olivia Hussey. The film has a great advantage though of good acting by the female leads played by Kidder and Hussey and there isn't a lot of gore, which proves Clark relies on good Hitchcokian suspense to scare, making the film not to be hampered by typical gatutus sex, nudity, gore, or sleaze.The story is about an obscene phone caller that dials up a sorority house. Finally the police trace the calls... and he's in the house!!!! Along the way, Black Christmas has the sorority girls go vanishing one by one. Still they don't really get it, going about their drunken holiday revelry without a care. The movie has several very interesting plot twists, but perhaps for new viewers it's now predictable and sometimes frustrating, such as the entire concept that we never really see the killer, who hides in the attic the entire time. Suspicions are cast on the crazy-boyfriend-as-a-potential-suspect (Dullea) of the coed (Hussey) that survives the longest, but his creepiness is never fully explored.Overall, while Black Christmas is innovative but made a strong attempt at suspense and terror, it would easily inspire many latter-day horror movies like Student Bodies, When a Stranger Calls, Silent Night, Deadly Night, Halloween, just to name a few, its progeny wouldn't always improve on the formula. Highly recommended!!!",Black Christmas
186,dorotka24,Beginnings of the slasher genre,9,23 May 2008,"Before Halloween, Friday the 13th, and countless other such films there was ""Black Christmas."" And unless you are a horror film aficionado, you probably had never heard of it.Of course there was the remake, or ""reimagining,"" a year or two ago, which I did not see but did not hear many good things about. After all, a truly good movie doesn't need to be remade, no matter how old it gets.Black Christmas definitely was good enough to stay un-reimagined. It will appear dated to some, but for me this really played in its favor. Older movies often have corny dialog, but it feels more genuine than many modern horror films. Characters that are truly terrified don't constantly make wisecracks or seem otherwise indifferent to their situation.The dark mood of the film was set very early, and was gradually built upon until the finale. It did not rely upon ""boo"" scares but upon ambiance, situations, and general creepiness to convey the horror.If you want to see the roots of the slasher genre, or are just pining for a unique and excellent horror experience, then Black Christmas won't disappoint.

In a shocking moment, one girl is murdered early on and left undiscovered in the house: an enduring and sorrowful image that the film returns to frequently throughout its duration. In a way, this is a comedy of errors - the comedy being extremely black in this case - as parents, friends and police fail to spot the clues right under their noses whilst further murders are carried out.Innovative and impactful use of camera angles, POV shots and editing really heightens the tension and terror as the film reaches its pivotal conclusion and the movie ends on a sickeningly ironic twist that leaves a lingering mood.Go out of your way to see this - especially at Christmas for added chills!",Black Christmas
188,DrPhibes1964,The scariest film I have ever seen,8,27 May 2021,"I caught this on a cable movie channel when it was under its alternative title Stranger in the House. It's a film that is impossible to ""spoil"" because there is no great reveal, which adds to the disturbing quality of the story. It was only recently that I have discovered that the identity of the killer was intentionally distorted so that we could never arrive at any definitive answer. Some might find this frustrating and annoying but it is the antithesis of the standard ""slasher"" flick. I cannot place this in that loathsome category. Since it was released before Halloween it cannot be lumped in with the rip off junk that followed in the footsteps of the John Carpenter film. He has obviously ""borrowed"" a lot from Black Christmas but it is hardly a copy. What is genuinely creepy and unsettling about Black Christmas is that it feels very plausible, with no invincible killer to be found in a hockey or some Halloween mask. It scares me more than The Exorcist. What distinguishes this from other films of the genre is that we sympathise with the victims. Each kill is shocking and disturbing. Many years ago I had the opportunity to meet Kier Dullea when he appeared at a Q & A for a screening of 2001 at the theatre where I worked. I regretted afterwards not mentioning Black Christmas (or whatever title it started with) and tell """" You were in the scariest film I have ever seen. """,Black Christmas

190,david-546,Still scary after 45 years,7,22 December 2019,"Our local festival theatre was showing Black Christmas for one night only so we decided it would be fun to go see it again. It was the 3rd time but the 1st on the big screen. We weren't disappointed. The film was shown in one of the larger theatres not the small venues they also had. The theatre was quite crowded although not full.From the beginning where we follow the serial killer through his eyes into the sorority house the film packed a punch. Billy is truly one sick crap. No we never get know who he is nor do we ever see him except in one scene that was truly disturbing all we see are his eyes. At times there were shadows in the background that made no sounds. But we heard his voice and it was truly disturbing.That the film does have a certain cheese element and lapses of logic does not take away from the fact that this film should rank up there with the best horror films. Suggestion and not seeing the killer are far better than seeing some crazed guy in a hockey mask come at you. It is not the first but many that came after pay homage to Black Christmas. Think Halloween. Before that there was Psycho and Peeping Tom (that ruined Michael Powell's career). And going back even further there was The Spiral Staircase (1945) where a deranged killer stalked girls with disabilities. Pretty daring for its time.Margot Kidder in particular stands out in the cast. This was before Superman. One should also see her in Sisters another truly creepy film. Sadly she has passed away. Also good was Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea was just creepy and disturbing. John Saxon also appeared as did Andrea Martin before SCTV.But it was the atmosphere created an atmosphere of dread and the voice of a deranged killer that you never saw.

I was expecting more of a ""Halloween"" type film, except the fact that the always brilliant Margot Kidder was in it. So I was into it from the start. The film follows a sorority house on the days proceeding Christmas when a psycho stalker starts getting into the house and, quite frankly, under the girls skin. Then the murders begin. Thesetting has been seen before, and so have the P.O.V. shots, but who cares?This film was scary anyway.Olivia Hussey is terrific and tense as the lead sorority sister, Jesse, who has the burden of dealing with all the other sisters' crisis problems. She looked really great too! And in the finale, she really played her role out for all it was worth.Kier Dullea was descent. A little too humble for the role, and not as, well,intimidating as he could have been. His scenes here are played out like a play. if not Broadway style, more conservative.Margot Kidder, being as good as she is, was not surprisingly fabulous! Hercharacter was the rough tough stuff sister who drinks, swears, and is the only one of them who has the guts to show off some glitz. The rest of the cast does just fine, particularly Andrea Martin as the soft spoken sister, John Saxon as the police chief who only wants to find the answer, and the actress who played Mrs. Mac was certainly worth the view too!Writing wise this film was greatly and adroitly planned. The central theme of this film is that you can't trust anyone, friend or foe, and the scares are genuine, and come psychologically, instead of in your face like ""Halloween"" or ""Friday the 13th."" Bob Clark is in love with his actors as he photographs them in brightexuberant colors, while his killer is photographed in jaundiced, grainy colors.

193,burnzyburns,Black Christmas,5,15 December 2020,"The grandfather of slasher films we know today all started with 1974's Black Christmas. Set during everyone's favourite time of the year, Black Christmas takes a total 180 approach on a usual upbeat holiday and makes it dark and mysterious. This film may have introduced the first person killer camera angle which has since been done better by recent films. The other camera angels are also well done and you can tell a lot of work went into that. The movie also uses a lot of phone calls that come with profound language and suspenseful leads (Sounds like Scream, right?). Lastly, I like how the killer is always kept a mystery. We don't truly know exactly who the killer is and we never visibly see the person.As much as I like the novelty behind this movie, I can say for certain that Black Christmas is INCREDIBLY boring. You will not believe how many scenes drag, how long we focus way too much on the police officers and the investigation of the murders, the killings are slow and unimaginable, and the dialogue will put you asleep standing up. The build-up to the climatic parts of the movie, which is basically the last 15 mins, isnt worth the trouble to sit through.Olivia Hussey eventually becomes the main character after it's not really determined who our main lead is at the beginning. She clearly acted well and did her part and she's absolutely stunning, but I feel her performance was wasted.Black Christmas has seemingly become buried in time. With some cool horror elements that have been copy and pasted into other horror franchises and a bar that was set for future horror movie directors, the unique history and nostalgia behind Black Christmas is undeniably intriguing. But as a movie of its own, Black Christmas mostly flops, and that is why I lead to believe that this film has been lost in time and why, for example, hasn't resonated with a younger crowd, or hasn't had too much of a cult following (not denying there's a cult following, because I do believe there is one but it's minimal in size).If you're a history of horror buff or wanting to learn more about it then take notes from Black Christmas, but be warned, this movie is awfully slow paced and it'll take a lot of patience to sit through the dialogue and suspense.",Black Christmas
194,matthewnoorman,One of the first and finest slasher films,9,20 September 2019,"A staple in horror history and an influence on the genre and start of the slasher era. One of my personal favorite horror films. I still do prefer John Carpenter's Halloween, but Black Christmas delivers a great combination of suspense and horror, along with an original and well written plot. You hardly ever see the killer yet this movie was horrifying for its time. Its mostly because the writing of the script, its suspensful, tactical, and realistic. You can relate to the situation, you can imagine yourself in this situation because it is much more realistic than a lot of horror movies. Not showing the killer till the end was an important aspect to this film, it slowly built up a plot, we got connected to some of the characters, once that connection happened, the horror starts. An underrated slasher forsure. Overall just a great horror film that any fan of the genre should see and own.

Can a low-gore slasher flick really work? You bet ya! Much better than most of the bloodbaths earning millions of dollars nowadays. ""Black Christmas"" is big on atmosphere and fear - but quite reserved regarding dismembered bodies and blood spatter. Also unusual for this genre, the acting is competent, and the potential victims are believable, likable characters - not insufferable morons. On top of all this, the fact that Olivia Hussey is in the cast makes this film a really good choice. Recommended.",Black Christmas

Please, even that thought starts to make me feel paranoid.Olivia Hussey (beautiful as ever) delivers a very convincing performance. Vivid appearance from Margot Kidder as the hard drinking Barb (sexually explicit jokes aplenty) and John Saxon as resourceful as always as Lt. Fuller. Bob Clarke shouldn't beat himself considering the fact that the ending was left to an unanswered scenario, who cares it's gem.

The telephone scenes are unnerving, the killer truly scary, and the ending is superlative, with a terrifying coda. It strains credulity sometimes, but the terrific use of setting, especially the snowbound Canadian campus, and the admirable character development (so it's not Anna Karenina; how many horror films actually give attention to the minor characters?) make for a highly recommended, as well as historically important, terror film. Olivia Hussey gives a standout performance, Margot Kidder steals her scenes, and Andrea Martin makes an impact in a non-comedic role. Definitely outshines its knockoffs.",Black Christmas

Boring, predictable and badly acted for the most part.  Even the murders suffer from a lack of a novel approach.  I did like the sicko's voice during the obscene phone calls and the scenes in the attic were creepy enough.  Had to watch the ending a few times cause I thought I'd missed something.  Turns out I didn't.  It's just bungled and falls rather flat. 
Perhaps this film was considered innovative at the time of its 1974 release, but it certainly hasn't aged well.  Worth checking out if you're a true fan of the genre, but there's nothing here you haven't seen before.  A far cry from what I consider Bob Clark's best horror film, Deathdream, a.k.a.

201,HorrorFreak1997,a true classic in both style and substance,10,31 August 2016,"the original black Christmas from the year 1974 directed by Bob Clark is a slasher classic. before john carpenters Halloween black Christmas really set the bar high for how good a slasher movie can be. I tend to go back and forth on which film I prefer but most of the time I do like this film better. it is a very stylish and slick film with a brisk pace that keeps you indulged in what's happening on screen. the atmosphere is genuinely chilling and the Christmas setting is used to deliver some dark and unique tones, which is impressive. most of the time when a Christmas setting is involved we are treated to more of a campy and fun style, but this film grits its teeth and stays dark and mysterious. the score is also great and complements the films visual style and setting very well. adding to the already intense and enthralling atmosphere. not only is the atmosphere an excellent aspect of the film but we also get some genuine suspense in multiple scenes. I'm aware that the film is old but for those of you that haven't seen it I won't spoil anything for you, but I will say that there are a few chilling scenes that really show us that bob Clark knows what he is doing behind the camera. he knows what to show and when to show it to get maximum effectiveness out of each scene. so of course this means the camera work is wonderful and another aspect of the film that is a true strength. the acting is also very good, john saxon, margot kidder, Olivia hussy, and keir dullea all give excellent performances. their characters are by no means complex but for what they have to work with they do, do an exceptional job. even the supporting cast are pretty good, especially considering for the most part they are all no name actors with little to no experience to my knowledge. the killer in the film is also a very memorable and iconic villain and his phone conversations with the sorority girls are definitely disturbing and riveting.in truth there really isn't anything wrong with the movie I give it a perfect 10/10",Black Christmas
202,aztrshbyz,An OK early slasher,5,2 September 2017,"My understanding is that BLACK Christmas is considered to be a cult classic because it is one of the first slasher movies; it laid the foundations for those that came later. Although pretty well done overall, it does have some problems. The film is lightly based on an urban legend - it concerns a Christmas holiday murderer who primarily targets those living in a sorority house. The killer may or may not be involved in some other murders around town, but the focus here is on the people living in the house.The acting is fairly well done by all of the cast, however, some of the characters are very one dimensional. We only see one side of their personality - the conservative virgin, the vulgar party girl and the inept policeman are perfect examples. There are others who are a little more fleshed out and have more depth to them, but the movie does suffer from that shallowness as many horror movies do.Unlike the slashers that came later, BLACK Christmas is very tame in it's graphic violence. Many of the murders take place off screen although the aftermath is generally seen. Although very little blood is filmed, the movie does have a fair amount of bad language so be warned if you don't like profanity or sexual references. It's definitely not suitable for kids.The film is really genuinely creepy in parts, especially in the interactions between the killer and the girls living in the sorority house. The ending is quite creepy as well.Parts of the movie don't make a lot of sense though. I don't want to get into any spoilers here, but lets just say that certain things should easily be heard when things are quiet. And of course, you have the character who stays and puts herself in danger when she's knows that things are quite amiss - one of my biggest pet peeves with horror movies. The film is pretty well paced overall which made it enjoyable to watch. Although some reviewers disagree, I actually did like it's final scenes but I wouldn't want to live in a town where the police don't think things through to a logical conclusion.If you like your horror tame, this one would be a pretty good choice if you can handle the vulgarity. There are other ""entry level"" horror films that are better, but this one is okay. I don't know that a seasoned horror buff who likes their movies bloody and violent would like it though.",Black Christmas

After a disturbing obscene phone call, a sorority house is stalked during Christmas break. Its really so 1970's, scenery and all, but the atmosphere is perfectly dark and creepy. The phone calls are deeply disturbing even by today's standards. Not always the best acted, sometimes bad, sometimes good and sometimes just stupid and funny. Like, what? ""Fellatio - 2 8 8 0"". Not much gore and often times very predictable, yet still genuinely effective. There are plots holes for sure and the killer isnt always the most believable person. You'll see lots of Christmas decorations so you can feel festive enough for this to be a Christmas movie. Is that really the dumbest cop ever?

Horror films from the 70s to the present are my favorite, but it's usually quite difficult to find the good ones amongst all the junk. I had gotten to the point to where I thought I had seen all of the great horror pictures of this time period...including...THE CHANGELING, AN American WEREWOLF IN London, THE DEAD ZONE, SHAUN OF THE DEAD, EVIL DEAD 2, THE THING (1982), HALLOWEEN, THE SHINING, SUSPIRIA, THE DESCENT, DEAD-ALIVE(aka BRAINDEAD), THE EXORCIST and THE BROOD...to name a few, so obviously I was skeptical that this film BLACK Christmas that had passed me by for almost my whole life could actually be as good as all my fellow IMDb reviewers were stating. But being a huge fan of Bob Clark's A Christmas STORY, I took a chance and purchased this DVD right out and to my surprise all of the hype didn't even begin to do this film justice. It's been compared to HALLOWEEN and John Carpenter's film is certainly one of the best of the genre but BLACK Christmas...dare I say it...is actually better..scarier and more original. First of all I was impressed by how good the film looked for its age. BLACK Christmas is a class act, with pretty fine actors, a great script and an excellent crew behind the camera. It's hard for a film to scare me after all the films I've seen but my wife and I were often creeped out by BLACK Christmas. There is very little gore and you don't see much of the killer which proves sometimes less is more...WAY MORE in this case. BLACK Christmas is now in my top five of all time horror flicks.

Clearly Bob Clarke knows how to use a camera to build up tension and disturb the viewer.

For starters it is directed by none other than the genius behind one of the most beloved Christmas classics in the history of Christmas classics, A Christmas Story (1983). Yes, the man himself, Mr. Bob Clark. I bet you're thinking to yourself, ""Self, I bet the movie this week is going to be a sweet, fun filled romp that will transport me back to when Christmas was chock full of magic and wonder."" Well, you'd be wrong. Instead, The Mock Films Blog is proud to present the one, the only (unless you include the lack luster remake from 2006) Black Christmas (1974).Why, you may ask, did I choose a horror film for this joyous holiday season? Well, honestly, if we can call Die Hard (1988) a Christmas movie then we can do the same for this one. (Merry Christmas. On with the blog.) The film revolves around a group of happy-go-drinky sorority sisters getting ready for Christmas break. Little do the naive ladies know, someone other than Santa will be paying them a visit this year.What makes this film so great is that it's as funny as it is scary. Clark puts his signature subtle humor that we saw in A Christmas Story and applies it to this much earlier work. Margot Kidder as the loose cannon is really amusing, along with the booze hound house mother played by Marian Waldman. But for all of its goofiness, the scares are just as strong. From the creepy POV of the killer wandering through the house unnoticed, the disturbingly graphic prank calls made to the sisters, to the solid gore effects,this is a nasty little jump scare flick. Although, it might be a rough watch for those who are bummed out easily during the holidays (go watch A Christmas Story marathon. Bob Clark thought of you too).—",Black Christmas
214,TriNitroToluene,Santa's not the fusing on this screen,8,21 January 2001,"This is the very first of it's kind in more than one aspect:  1) It is basically the first real slasher film.  2)  It is the first movie to really employ the phone terror tactic.  3)  It is the first movie to show the film through the killer's eyesight.  This are 3 very big firsts, because they have shaped the horror genre very drastically.  So this is like a monument to the whole genre of horror.  Is it worthy of this title?  Yes, it was a very daring, slick movie that was overlooked when it came out, but it has now quickly become a classic.  People are finally recognizing it for what it was.  It isn't fair to compare this movie to Halloween.  Halloween had a much bigger budget, and more polished shooting.  The guys that made Black Christmas didn't have very much to work with, but they still pulled something tremendous off.  The gore is basically non-existant in this film, but there is a fair amount of suspense to it which is a plus to most people. Now what really makes this movie shine is the atmosphere, it is really straight to the point and very dark.  The movie begins immediately, there is no beating around the bush!  And the movie also ends very abruptly leaving you in question at times.  That is another plus.  Basically, all appreciators of the slasher genre should check this movie out, if they haven't done so already.

215,ReelBrew,"A sorority house is terrorized by obscene phone calls, while one by one the girls are stalked from within the house.",8,23 December 2015,"It's the night before Christmas Eve at a campus sorority house when the phone rings. The muffled breaths of the caller can be heard on the other end. Soon, heavy breathing turns into lascivious outbursts, cries that egg on Barb (Margot Kidder) while unsettling the rest. Soon, nobody can find Clare (Lynne Griffin), which leads her father (James Edmond) to contact the police, lead by Lt. Fuller (John Saxon). With the disturbing calls continuing into Christmas Eve, and Jess' (Olivia Hussey) boyfriend upset, it soon becomes evident that there's more to the night than just carol's and Christmas lights.When an unsuspecting world received Black Christmas, the term and sub-genre slasher wouldn't insert itself into the mainstream canon for another 4 years. Pre-dating John Carpenter's Halloween, the aforementioned cannonball to the eyes of American cinema, our film aptly embraces the first person perspective alarmingly introduced with such films as Peeping Tom and Psycho. While the former, Michael Powell's compellingly voyeuristic tale, ultimately ushered in the perspective that would end up widely used in the genre, it wasn't until Bob Clark's holiday slasher that we would see its use popularized in film.What Black Christmas does exceptionally well is assert an uncomfortable gaze over its viewer, one that helps peel backs its grainy, exploitative layer with a razor sharp masculine fixation on the female body. We witness the sorority house from afar, only getting closer as our peeping tom does. Even when we're invited in before he climbs through an upstairs window, it's always through the perceived eyes of our voyeur. The masculine gaze controls much of our perception as he slowly preys on the sorority sisters, a light cascading across a peering eye. When Claire is strangled, her body is propped up by a window with her eyes peering out and mouth agape, echoing the sexually deranged moans of our caller.It's these perverse and sexually driven calls that push our film forward, filling every frame with tension on what we already know. Bob Clark frames the horror with staircases, doorframes and windows, utilizing these as the eyes of our killer. While we don't know who it is, we know where he is; yet this understanding only adds increased value to the terror that presses down on us. It's a pressure that weighs so heavy it rests in our stomach, a feeling Jess carries with her as she tells her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) of her pregnancy and impending abortion. When he tells her what she can and cannot do with her own pregnancy, he stares at her with the same fixation as our killer.Writer Roy Moore plays between the killings and a male-dominated state of mind with a juxtaposition that reverberates even more so today. Peter tells Jess that she can't kill the baby, while she never implies that it's a baby nor uses the word kills. We then shift back to the sorority house, a home that is devoid of male governance, save for the looming eyes of our intruder. The dominating male gaze echoes the dominating male voice that pushes Jess away, further into our place of murder. These transitions spur on the ominous dread that hangs in the air as each kill unfolds, our now final girl clinging to a hope we know doesn't exist.The world that Bob Clark and Roy Moore bring to life is reminiscent of its time, yet mirrors those that we live in today. Its morally strong lead, and similarly dueling views, both literally and symbolically, helped usher in the sub-genre that films like Silent Night, Deadly Night and Night of the Demons would inevitably destroy in the years to come. Black Christmas works as a powerfully affecting, unsettling piece of pre-slasher filmmaking that establishes itself as an important piece in horror cinema.",Black Christmas

222,fdpedro,"""If this movie doesn't make your skin crawl... then it's on too tight!""",10,3 November 2003,"Released and ignored in 1973, ""Black Christmas"" became a forgotten classic. The Canadian shocker was eventually re-released as ""Silent Night, Evil Sight"" in order to avoid confusion with the blaxploitation films of the time, but it bombed once again. In the early 80s, it was broadcast on cable as ""Stranger in the House"" in order to snatch up some rantings. Right when the movie seemed dead, NBC decided to cancel a prime-time airing of it because it was deemed ""too scary"" for network television. This was all film-buffs needed to go back and discover the wonderful ""cool movie that you never heard of"" that is ""Black Christmas"".Before I go on, here it goes: ""Black Christmas"" is one of the scariest (and finest) horror films ever made. Major credit must go to director Bob Clark (who went on to direct the epic ""Citizen Kane"" remake and because of legal reasons had to change it's title to ""Porky's"") who like John Carpenter in ""Halloween"", is able to create a current and simplistic creepy atmosphere. ""Black Christmas"" is indeed very similar to ""Halloween"": Both movies are themed with a particular time of year, both movies feature a killer with breathing problems who loves POV shots, and both movies have a long and slow build-up that makes the audience care for the characters that are about to get slashed. The difference is that ""Black Christmas"" does it much better, in fact, I think it is a superior film.The movie begins with a shaky POV shot of a stranger who decides to sneak inside a sorority house in order to get some fresh meat. That's it! Plain and simple. There is no ""your father killed my cousin's cat"" motive, the killer wants to kill because he simply wants to. Isn't it much scarier like that? No motive at all?The cast is not your usual teen slasher stereotypes: There is the not-so-virginal sweet leading lady Jess (Olivia Hussey) who is having trouble because she wants to have an abortion. Her boyfriend Peter (Keir Duella) eventually disagrees. In the sorority house there are many other odd characters, including chain-smoking, foul-mouthed, heavy-drinking Barb (ironically played by Margot Kidder) who steals the show with the much-needed humor. Unlike the countless other slashers out there, ""Black Christmas"" takes time for the audience to get used to these characters and actually care for them. Unlike in ""Halloween"", the entire top-notch cast in ""Black Christmas"" give excellent performances. Olivia Hussey is perfect as not-so-innocent Jess, Keir Duella is scary and misleading as her deranged boyfriend. And of course, Margot Kidder steals the show with an excellent and amusing take playing herself. Also noticeable is cult star John Saxon as Lt. Fuller who many years later started showing his personal love for ""Black Christmas"" on interviews.The well-balanced doses of drama and comedy connects the audience to the characters on screen so strongly that they sometimes we forget it is a horror movie. And when something scary eventually happens, it comes as a total shock. Bob Clark eventually became famous for his comedies, and you can sense his upbeat sense of humor though the entire film. Recent movie audiences lost their patience, so movies like that can't be made anymore. And there is a good reason ""Black Christmas"" is currently labeled as a comedy at the IMDb, it is really funny. So many memorable quotes here: ""These broads could hump the Leaning Tower of Pisa if they could get to top of it!"" or ""I'm a drunk? Here we have the queen of vodka herself!"" and of course, the whole Fellatio address.But isn't this a horror film? It really lives up to it's tagline. To begin with, the killer is not a silent invincible maniac on a Santa Claus costume. Instead, he is never seen. Most of his moments come from POV shots and dark takes. He is confined to the sorority house's attic for most of the time. How is that scary? Sound comes to play. The killer calls the sorority girls though the phone many times (early shades of ""Scream"" and ""When a Stranger Calls"") and uses some of the most disturbing voices you will ever hear. He imitates pigs squeaking, perverted dirty talk, animal noises, screaming, heavy breathing, and many other weird sounds. Does it work? Of course. This guy makes Norman Bates look like Richard Simmons.These disturbing elements are all put together though the brilliant cinematography by Reg Morris, who is able to capture the silent Christmas atmosphere perfectly with the wonderful use of silent snow-covered streets and decoration. Let's face it, Christmas is a bit creepy, isn't it? It certainly will be after watching this flick. The piano score by Carl Zittrer is simplistic and effective as well. The repetitive use of Christmas carols also add up to the tension.Ignored over the years and unknown outside the cult horror fans, this is an underrated classic that deserves much more attention that it ever got. Everything is perfect in this Canadian chiller: The atmosphere, the music, the overall spooky look, and one of the scariest villains in history. No gore (although the killings are so disturbingly shot they don't really need any) no sex, no nudity, just plain old-fashioned horror. This is ""Black Christmas"": Snow-covered silent streets, creepy Christmas carols, spooky use of lightening and color, scary atmosphere and the overall look of the plastic bag suffocated victim in a rocking chair staring from the attic window. Trust me, you will never go to your attic the same way again.""Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, a creature was staring...""",Black Christmas
223,sjhollen,I appreciate it for what it was,4,26 November 2020,"Black Christmas was just boring and not atmospheric enough for my taste. I did not like the killer at all, I did not find him scary, and him acting like a child on the phone calls was not scary at all and very annoying. They also put way too much effort into trying to make us believe that her boyfriend was the killer. I had a hard time taking this movie seriously and couldn't wait until it was over. I will not watch it again. I respect what it was, and how it inspired Halloween, which is my favorite horror movie of all time, but that doesn't mean I have to like it",Black Christmas
224,meganmarie-19902,Have Yourself A Very Merry Black Christmas,7,26 November 2018,"In 1974, Bob Clarke's Black Xmas kick started the teenage slasher sub-genre. The seasonal slasher went on to leave an impression on John Carpenter, who years later gave us Halloween. So, do I expect to be disappointed with a remake of such am iconic cult classic? It is hard to get excited over teenage slasher films these days, but Glen Morgan reinstalled that excitement. Billy Lenz has just been released from a mental institution and is looking to find his childhood home where he was abused by his mother. However, the house is now occupied by sorority sisters. With the students unaware of the troubled history of the house and a deranged killer seeking revenge, it's a race against time for the college girls to survive.
An aspect of this movie that makes it stand out is that it delves into Billy's back story and it gives the film more depth. The sorority sisters each have something different to bring to the table, this makes it easier to get a bond with the characters. As the producers were responsible for films such as Final Destination, I was hoping for gory scenes and I received them. Overall, yes, it is predictable at times, but it is worth the watch and has a decent twist at the end.",Black Christmas
225,hypostylin,Sensational Slasher Fare,10,1 January 2008,"Don't ever confuse this with the antagonistically wretched 2006 remake. The original Black Christmas is a masterful, progenitive slasher film that constantly tests my loyalty to John Carpenter's Halloween. Like that latter film, Black Christmas' strength is in its simplicity: a demented killer is making disturbing (and I mean DISTURBING) phone calls to a snowbound Canadian sorority house, sleepily populated by a skeleton crew of Christmas break stragglers. Little do they know, the calls are coming from inside the house.A major trick that elevates the simple plot, however, is that, even though we know from the get go that the calls are coming from inside the sorority house, the film is scant on so many other details that we feel as in the dark and uneasy as the characters. Our interest in the film is sustained throughout because we want to know what happens to these people.That brings me to my next point. Surely odd for a slasher film, the characters in Black Christmas are well-drawn and the performances that fill them are top-notch. Olivia Hussey (one of the most beautiful women to ever grace the screen) and Margot Kidder are, of course, the obvious stand-outs, as the grave and level-headed Jess and drunken, sailor-mouthed Barb respectively. However, there are other remarkable players here, including Marian Waldman in a delightfully hilarious role, genre veteran John Saxon, and Art Hindle, who went on to play a fantastic leading man in David Cronenberg's not-so-fantastic The Brood.Overall, the film is seeping with classic '70s style and atmosphere. Even the minimalist score, with its quiet, brooding sustained notes, reveals a bygone flair for film-making. Lastly, the phone calls the killer makes have to be heard to be believed. If you were scared by Regan's possessed ramblings in The Exorcist, Billy's psychotic shrieks will have you trembling for days.",Black Christmas
226,mjscarface,Genuinely scary and different,8,15 March 2006,"I'll start by saying what everyone else has already said about Black Christmas. Imagine its 1974, you haven't seen Halloween, Friday the 13th or Scream. The term ""slasher movie"" barely exists. Now watch Black Christmas and you'll see just how innovative and scary it was and still is.An unknown figure breaks into the attic of a sorority house as it clears out for the holidays. Amongst those left are; Jess, who is pregnant and wants an abortion and Barb who is a foul-mouthed good-time-girl. Before long, the house mates receive some VERY obscene phone calls (which are virtually the sole reason for its rating). Then, one of the girls disappears...Whilst this may seem generic, it is still pretty groundbreaking by today's standards. Most of the killings are never shown and corpses are never found; the park-search scene is very effective for instance. Characterisation is strong; Jess' abortion and her boyfriend's despair at it is pretty dramatic. The level of humour is unusual, without edging into comedy. The killer himself (who we never see at all) is one of the most frightening characters in cinema; a nut-case who screams wildly, reenacts bizarre domestic situations and has a very disturbing back-story to do with a baby.The script is fresh, the direction is tight and is basically just damn scary. Black Chistmas is arguably my favourite horror film because of these reasons.",Black Christmas
227,kreeper,still the greatest,10,1 March 2001,"i have seen this classic more often than any other film in my life. i ran the college film program and this was the number one most popular film shown. i saw this movie 7 times in the course of three days and loved every minute of it. i have seen about every horror/slasher film ever made and this is still #1. margot kidder gives a brilliant performance as barb-from the moment she tells her mom that she's a gold plated whore after being dumped at xmas she takes the film by the balls and runs away with it. and the phone calls...what can i say, if you watch it again and really listen to what seems like raving lunacy the first time, the calls actually tell the back story of the killer and perhaps why he came to that house to kill. and its thrillingly directed, and the ending will chill your bones. and john carpenter and everyone else ripped this film off and it should be watched again and again and release it on dvd damn it!!!!!!!",Black Christmas

I had never heard of it but before renting it I checked out the reviews and it seemed like a great one to rent. Now that I've seen it, I don't understand why so many think this was so scary. The movie seemed very slow at times. Also, there really was not much blood, gore, or killings. I did think that the phone calls were very creepy. I hated the end of this movie. There was no explanation for anything that happened. I felt like I watched the movie and I'm still waiting for it to end. Just horrible. Probably the worst ending ever. I did enjoy a young John Saxon though. I guess this movie is worth a viewing but that's about it. I also don't understand why some are comparing this to Halloween? There are no similarities and Halloween is a million times better than this.",Black Christmas
229,haudit,Creeped me right out!!!!!,8,2 September 2001,"A very simple tale, with the slaughter of a bunch of sorority girls during the Christmas period.  This film is reminiscent of 'Halloween', so now we know where John Carpenter got most of his ideas (heavy breathing, POV shots) from.The main difference between this and 'Halloween' is the fact that the killer is never actually seen in full - the most we ever see of him is his eye peeping through a crack in the door.  The death scenes are also far more inventive - the first girl to die is killed using the plastic surrounding the dry-cleaning in her wardrobe (Michael Myers isn't intelligent enough to do that), and her dead body is glimpsed throughout the rest of the film sitting in a rocking chair in the attic.  The most disturbing aspect of this film, however, is the way the killer rants down the phone (from inside the house!!!! - top that Scream!)- they make no sense at all and serve to make him all the more creepy.The ending of this film is a total shocker, almost totally unexpected!  I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, but let's just say it'll have you checking all those dark corners in your house for things that go bump in the night!!!I saw 'Black Christmas' over the Christmas period in 2000, when UK TV station Channel 4 decided, in their infinite wisdom, that what the schedules really need at Christmas is a slasher movie.  I'm glad they did show it, as I had never even heard of it before..... which is a bit surprising considering the cast of Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea (post-2001) and Margot Kidder (pre-Superman).If you can find this film in your local video store (probably under the title 'Silent Night, Evil Night'),go ahead and rent it - I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

231,jvontheprowl,The ending broke the movie.,6,27 April 2021,"This will be an unpopular review. Just hear me out.The movie has its great moments and memorable moments. John Saxon is hunky John Saxon around his height. (The story behind how he got the role is really sad. You should seek it out.)There are too many red herrings that have no point to the story. The movie moves so incredibly slow. It keeps trying to take off and the lack of backstory and focus on the many flat jokes just yanks it down.I read all these praises about this movie and looked forward to watching this film. I don't understand the praise. Even amongst the genre it isn't that good. Compared to Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which came out months before this so don't think this is the first slasher, it is Revenge of the Killer Tomatoes.It doesn't hold up to movies of that genre's era. Many of the firsts people attribute it for, aren't firsts. POV cam was Alfred Hitchcock, the slasher (as a direct slasher movie) was probably Psycho and Peeping Tom in 1960. It could go all the way back to the 1910s.It didn't influence everything and is only famous because of the mishandling of its release and being around the same time as actual similar murders. Along with the spin machine that was Bob Clark.I don't enjoy criticising this movie. It is a fun watch up till the end. It didn't make a single piece of sense.You should watch it because of some of the great kills of famous actresses and the general story. It also has John Saxon. You can't go wrong with this movie to get a good scare. Just forget about the Swiss cheese plot.",Black Christmas

233,Sewaat,A Christmas film that's full of surprises,8,6 November 2015,"If you're getting tired of re-runs that show the same Christmas films every Holiday season and you happen to also enjoy horror films, then I would strongly recommend that you take the time to watch Black Christmas this year. It will be worth every minute of your time.Black Christmas is a Canadian horror film and the second that I've had the pleasure of seeing. The first being The Changeling, which has a very similar tense and eerie atmosphere. However, Black Christmas definitely appeals more to a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour so it's definitely the funnier of the two films. The jokes are really well done and do a marvelous job of lightening up the mood at appropriate moments. But that's not to say that the film's more unsettling scenes aren't superb either. They're masterfully well executed, invoking mystery and suspense at every twist of the plot.The cinematography is fantastic. I am not sure if it was the first film to employ the use of a camera that could strap onto an actor's head but it's used to great effect in the opening scene of Black Christmas. The acting from Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, John Saxon and the rest of the supporting cast leave nothing to be desired. Everyone is clever and convincing as their characters. They feel very authentic and none of them had to resort to chewing the scenery, as is often the case with slasher films. I wish I could go into detail about the movie's more brilliant aspects, but it's far better than you go into this film knowing as little as possible. This film will keep you guessing right until the very end. It plays you like a fiddle the moment you press play but you'll enjoy every moment of it. Black Christmas is thrilling, terrifying and darkly humorous. A very different twist on your typical Christmas film.",Black Christmas

235,jademcpherson18,Decent film - definitely thought about it when I went to sleep,7,26 November 2013,"I enjoyed this film - it was tense and left you guessing who was next and who the killer was. A fair warning, on one of the phone calls the language used is obscene and really offensive, but the rest is not bad. The killer is very scary!!! The noises he makes are very scary and disturbing. To be honest, the killings are not graphic at all (as to be expected of such an old film). I was a bit worried about it at the start (the film is made out to be a slasher movie) but it is not in the least bit gory. The biggest question of the movie is who the killer is and we never actually see him/her so it leaves it to your imagination what he looks like!!!",Black Christmas

I'm not going to tell you the plot the Db already has it but I would really like to recommend this to anyone looking for a great horror film. The lighting is perfect the fact that the killer's face is never seen until the end, (but wait is she/he really the killer???) The acting is great and it has a fine cast for a slasher film, people who's fame really kicked in, or already had like Keir Dullea from Kubrick's 2001 which was prior to this. He was in his early 30s playing a kid in his early 20s. Margot's cocky and obnoxious sorority girl is great too. But the most unsettling thing about this film (in a good way) would have to be the creepy phone calls. So go rent this film you won't regret it.",Black Christmas
237,Sam_Movie_Buff,Silence is the scariest!,10,8 February 2008,"I have often wondered why there are so many bad horror movies these days. Movies that instead of focusing on suspense and real chills, just pour endless amounts of blood in your face, thinking this will do the trick, and hopefully become a cult classic. Film after film, more and more horror movies are becoming increasingly similar, and you can almost guess the whole entire plot of the movie, no more than 10 minutes into the film. Everything in horror these days is all about over the top special effects, numbingly loud thumping music, that is supposed to get you scared. Black Christmas (the original) is (IMO) one of the best and scariest horror movies ever made. Why? you ask. Let me tell you. There are so many reasons. First. In horror today, when someone (usually the pretty girl) is walking towards a door or a room (thinking someone will be there) - and they are. The film makers feel the need to spoil the moment with ridiculously loud music that is (intended) to get you all hyped up for the big surprise. When they don't realise that this spoils 99% of the scene. For instance, 10 minutes into the movie, one of the sorority girls ""Claire"" goes up stairs to her room, to pack some things, preparing for a trip. While entering the room she is greeted by the house cat ""Claud"". While packing, Claire hears a strange meow. At first she just ignores, but the meow gets more and more intense and chillingly creepy. She then notices that the meow is coming from the closet (not far from where she is standing) at the end of the room (and the closet door is open). She paces towards the closet (with a terrified stare) quickly realising that the meow is not coming from the house cat, asking ""Who is that?"" several times. The thing that makes this scene 'GOLD' is while walking to the closet and asking ""Who is that?"" there is no music! - just dead silence. This makes the scene and situation seem more real and 1000 times more scary. The viewers are at the edge of their seat, hanging on to pure silence while she walks further and further to the closet. This is far more terrifying than continuous loud music, that spoils the moment, because you know by the music when the killer is going to approach. That scene is horror at it's best and everyone should see the film for that scene alone. Secondly, the entrance of the movie is shocking. The camera is filmed like a documentary (like the camera is the stalker, walking nearer and nearer to the house) While spying on his victims he realises he is able to climb to the top of the house where he can enter the attic. The directer's captured this amazingly and it gave off that feeling, that raw, real, scare, that this really could happen to anyone. One of the standout scares and scenes that stick in your brain are the chillingly disturbing phone call scenes. The girls receive numerous phone calls from the same man, only there's a catch. It's not your typical Scream phone call were the killer asks ""Are you alone?"" and ""What's your favourite scary movie?"" he talks with himself, displaying what appears to be a severe split personality. The phone calls get more and more scary as the movie goes on. Especially near the end were the killer actually goes crazy portraying more than 4 different voices and characters - the horrific sound of his voice will haunt you after the movie is over (which I guess is great for the Creator, as all the best horror movies make long lasting impressions). The last thing I will say is there are a lot of people, reviewers, saying the end was disappointing because they still don't know who the killer is. Huh? lets get this straight. The killer isn't a person in the movie who is coming across nice, nor is he pretending to be a close friend - in fact he doesn't know any of the girls at all. He is merely a deranged, dangerous man who passed a sorority house and thought it would be fun to hide inside their attic and hack them off 1 by 1. I will not spoil the rest of the movie for those who haven't seen it. All I will say is if you want a great horror movie that when the credits role you will be afraid to walk upstairs, THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. You will also be staring at your attic door for about a week.",Black Christmas
238,monkeysontoast,Classic? Perhaps. Classic example of crap? Precisely.,4,16 July 2006,"After waiting all this time to see BC, Netflix finally started carrying it, and I promptly pushed it to the top of my queue. I wasn't expecting a film better than Halloween, as no horror can surpass it, IMO. I WAS expecting a creepy movie with some similar elements, though...and boy did this movie disappoint! The phone calls were nowhere near frightening or unsettling, and they actually made me laugh a few times. There was no build-up before any of the murders...I never once gripped the arm of the sofa, or felt the urge to yell, ""look out, he's in the room!"", which is what makes slashers so enjoyable. Th 'red herring' wasn't a very good one, because, well, WE knew it wasn't him, because we follow the murderer into the house in the very beginning, which made the revelation at the end kind of, erm, pointless. The movies was decently acted, though at times a bit overacted...John Saxon was the best thing about the movie. Overall, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this 'classic' horror flick. I'll stick to Halloween, and many other look-a-likes, any day of the week. 4/10",Black Christmas
239,oceanbeachbum10,I fell asleep 4 times,3,30 April 2020,"This is such a boring movie. No wonder Halloween (which is technically the 'sequel' of Black Christmas) became extremely more popular. This is such a slow paced movie, with boring scenes, and nothing really redeemable. I guess it had a lot of promise due to the reviews and Christmas atmosphere.. but it's literally so boring I forced myself to watch it. It took them the entire movie to figure out the killer was in the house, without them even checking the house in the first place. This is a ridiculous movie.",Black Christmas
240,LuckyMatt93,A genuine horror masterpiece,10,1 February 2009,"This is not just the godfather of all slashers, it's the godfather of all horror films. Black Christmas is a sharp edged gem that sadly never garnered the popularity that it's inferior ripoffs like Halloween did and in consequence never got the praise it much deserved. Depressing, really depressing.The director, Bob Clark, takes his time setting up a dark mood, and exploiting his eerie setting fully while giving us hints of slick style on the way (the killer POV shots and the slow motion). He also inter-cuts murder sequences with mundane events which makes the scenes quite effective. He gives us a solid script, excellent old fashioned suspense, and a strong atmosphere to rely on that oozes with an unrelenting creepiness.Character development sets this one apart from other horror films. Olivia Hussey is angelic as the film's resident Scream Queen. Her character, Jessica, is thinking about having an abortion; she's definitely not your modern day leading lady for a slasher film, which usually involves someone pure at heart, innocent and virginal. These troubles that Jessica goes through add depth to her character, making her impossible not to like and adding the reality of character flaws to the whole picture. The rest of the characters are given a lot of depth as well, and this really helps you sympathize for them.Music, like Halloween, is just as important of a factor as any horror classic. Perhaps it has to do with Peter, Jessica's boyfriend, being a pianist, that the scoring is a low and aggressive piano set. It's the part of the film that makes your creep bone crawl. Jessica receives a phone call from the killer, who shouts out ""Billy!"" ""Agnes!"" ""What your mother and I must know is..."" and other disturbing, seemingly meaningless quotes. His voice is dark, almost demonic, and uses multiple high and low tones that sometimes overlap each other. The question often comes up of whether or not the killer called ""Billy"", is possessed, or just very talented at what he does. The 2006 remake of Black Christmas, Black X-Mas, tries to answer every single question of what ""Billy"" is saying in the original, and explain his background. To do so completely destroys the purpose of Bob Clark's film, as the scariest aspect of Black Christmas is all of the things that you don't know. We enjoy wondering who the killer is, what his motive exactly is, where he came from, do we know him already? What is his motive? Where did he come from? Do we know him already? The film gives us just enough information and clues to chew on without providing straight out concrete answers. This allows the film to linger in our minds as we try to figure out what our own opinions are as to it's many mysteries. It's all in the mind, which is where the BEST creativity comes from (Blair Witch Project, Rosemary's Baby, etc). The lesser we see and the lesser we know, the better.Black Christmas was made before the thousands of clichés of the slasher genre became typical, and has impacted American slashers like few others. Halloween has the mystery of who the killer is nearly down pat; it was a holiday horror with a stalker and anonymous phone callers. When a Stranger Calls took the nerve smashing concept from Black Christmas and used it for the opening act, where ""the calls were coming from inside the house."" Many slashers to follow would use Black Christmas' ""Is that you?"" line when a character would wonder who is lurking about. Today, the creepy caller often gets spoofed (Student Bodies) or updated in the form of a less effective cell phone (Scream). This Canadian terror has influenced SO SO many artistic gems that it feels like a crime that it is rarely seen as the powerhouse it deserves to be acknowledged as. No doubt, if Bob Clark could've copyrighted the slasher movie concepts and clichés that he created, he would've been just as famous as John Carpenter or Wes Craven, maybe even more.It's simple (like Halloween) and doesn't require any additions to make it stronger. It's damn near flawless for gods sake! It's a truly fantastic masterpiece of horror cinema, the best horror film ever made. We never find out the answers to the killings at the house. This may be frustrating to some, but it's really a concept of genius, keeping the evil untouched and ready to haunt our minds on the night of December 24th.",Black Christmas
241,TheCharles,Wrong Number?,7,13 March 2016,"Black Christmas, also known as Silent Night, is a Psychological Slasher Horror movie and considered to be one of the earliest Slasher films in general. It's based on a urban legend about a teenage girl babysitting children who receives telephone calls from a man who continually asks her to ""check the children"". If that doesn't sound like the perfect Christmas flick for the entire family, then I don't know. The actresses are both gorgeous and talented, but what I loved most about this movie is that unsettling voice that you keep hearing through the phone. It's genuinely disturbing and I didn't even understand everything he mumbled. The contrast between the Christmas/ holiday spirit with the dark atmosphere works perfectly. The movie isn't really that graphic but again, that voice will possibly haunt you for a while. Another interesting element is that we look through the killers perspective, which allowed to killer to keep his identity secret from the audience.

244,madahab,Scarier than The Exorcist,8,29 September 2021,"I saw Black Christmas when it was under its alternate title Stranger In the House and knew this was a classic. It crawled under my skin unlike any other horror film (with the exception of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). I don't know if there is a distinction between scary and disturbing but the film works on the latter. The premise cannot be more simplke: a lunatic is prowling around a college sorority house around the Christmas season, picking off one girl after another. Without knowing any better you'd think that this was a rip off of Halloween but it predates the John Carpenter film by four years. Halloween was probably heavily influenced by Black Christmas,especially the numerous Point of View shots. What distinguishes the two is that we have no idea who killer is or why he is killing girls. There are hints that this is a demented boyfriend who goes crazy when his girlfriend aborts his child, but nothing is clearly explained. It makes the killer all the more frightening because there is no apparent motive and we fear for each female left inside the sorority house. It is a film that I find more frightening than The Exorcist. The demonic possession of a 12 year old girl I find implausible but a lunatic in a house (especially if one recalls the Richard Speck killings of several student nurses) is terrifyingly plausible. There are scenes that still send a chill down my spine. The cast is outstanding and are more than just walking meat bags to be killed off. We feel their deaths more than any other slasher flicks. It's hard to believe that this is the same Bob Clark who will go on to make A Christmas Story. Although many see Halloween as the originator of the modern slasher flicks it was Black Christmas which ranks as one of the best.",Black Christmas

And I had never seen this movie at all not even the trailer, but i heard i rocked! so i popped it in the DVD player at about around 11:00 pm. And i switched off the lights. This movie had a great atmospehre, it is a very dark film. After the movie was over, i sat there in shock. Most movies i've seen such as Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Friday the 13th. They don't really do that to me. But it made afraid of the dark again. Yes AGAIN. But the deaths are so different, and the suspense really builds up. This is my #1 favorite horror movie ever!! And it predated Halloween buy 4 YEARS! This is highly recommended to slasher buffs. If you are a fan of Gore there is very little this is not a gory movie at all!

There was no fun about it, it was just non-stop scary and it's probably one of the best horror movies of all time. They all say that Halloween was THE horror movie but I tell you after you watch this movie, you'll change your mind. If you think that horror movies are not really scary and you're just wasting your money, rent Black Christmas and you'll literally be screaming through the movie. With The Omen you can have fun with it because it can't happen but once you watch this murder-massacre movie, you'll want guards behind your house. There were some excellent performances by Olivia Hussey as the main character and Margot Kidder was a supporting actress in this movie. In my opinion it was scarier than ""The Exorcist"" and should have won Oscars for Bob Clark for ""Best Director"", Olivia Hussey for ""Best Actress"" and Margot Kidder for ""Best Supporting Actress"". This movie makes other scary movies look like comedies. Once you watch it, you'll remember it forever!!",Black Christmas
249,Glyde Stick,Why can't they make films like this anymore?,9,13 March 2001,"Having read several of the comments regarding this film and how it was so influential on many slasher films made since, I was expecting an outstanding thriller.  I must say I was not disappointed.  This was an actual scary movie!  The refreshing thing about this movie was it did not use extremely gory special effects or cheap sex scenes (although sexual innuendos are littered throughout the film).Aside from being a little dated (the 70's fashion was rampant) this film has really held up over time.  Having seen most (if not all) of the films referred to in the previous comments as having ""ripped off"" Black Christmas, it is obvious this film was indeed used as a blueprint for several of the ""slasher"" movies that followed.*** The following commentary contains SPOILERS ***Having said that I do disagree, however, with several comments made that John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" was a blatant ripoff of this movie.  Aside from a homicidal killer who murders girls during a holiday, I did not see a lot of similarities.  Granted the victims were killed in similar methods (stabbing or strangulation) but let's be honest - except in the numerous Friday the 13th movies where each sequel featured new and exciting ways to kill people (everything from hedge clippers to spear guns), there aren't that many ways a psychopath uses to kill someone in a slasher film (and stabbing and strangulation are pretty common).  But I didn't see Michael Myers playing with any of the victims long after they were dead (as the killer in this film did with Claire, the first victim, who he rocked in a chair from time to time).  I don't recall Michael Myers making repeated and lengthy obscene phone calls to his victims before he killed them.  In Halloween, there was no question of who the killer was at the end.  I didn't see the killer in Black Christmas wear a mask, steal his dead sister's headstone, or escape from an insane asylum.  So where, exactly, does the ""blatant ripoff"" occur?Slasher films all have a basic premise (psycho killer for various reasons stalk and kill helpless victims who may or may not have been a part of the killer's past) so you can pick any two films out of the slasher genre and draw similarities.  Granted ""Black Christmas"" was one of the first films in this genre and, as I mentioned earlier, there are remarkable resemblances between this film and others (most notably the opening scene of ""When a Stranger Calls"").  But I would hesitate to say any one slasher film was a ""blatant ripoff"" of another.  Even the original ""Friday the 13th"" had enough differences from ""Halloween"" to avoid the ""blatant ripoff"" stigma.The Bottom Line: Black Christmas is a very good and effective thriller with an undeniable influence on the entire slasher genre that followed it.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good tingle of the spine.",Black Christmas

This movie may have came out before Halloween, but it's inferior in every possible way to Carpenter's masterpiece. For starters, the amount of plot holes in this film is large. One glaring one being when Billy makes the phone calls and screams at the top of his lungs from supposedly in the house, nobody hears him. I can't fathom that. They must of been deaf. I'm still also confused as to how Billy can make those calls inside the house. How can he dial the same number from a phone inside the same house? Aren't all of the lines connected? Why would the phone ring? It makes no sense to me. I also found it funny how the cops didn't seem to bother checking around the house to find any bodies...as the body upstairs of the first girl murdered is shown at the ending.All and All, I felt this movie was poorly written. It didn't scare me one bit. If anything I laughed multiple times at the bad acting and incoherent rants from Billy. It gets a 4/10 from me, and that's being generous.",Black Christmas
253,fritz_fraugman,The Proto-Slasher? SPOILERS!!!!,5,20 May 2009,"The film opens with a creepy POV cam shot of a person spying through windows and proceeds to scale up the lattice to an open attic window.Four girls Jess, party animal Barb, Phyllis, Clare, and Claude the cat are harassed by a obscene caller they dub ""The Moaner"" alone in a sorority house under the care of a drinker house mother named Mrs Mac. The calls have begun a day before Christmas Eve. When everybody is getting ready to spend the holiday weekend with family or friends or boyfriends.This same day Phyllis has promised to go skiing with Barb and her parents, Clare plans are to be picked up by her father, and Jess wants to meet her boyfriend Peter before his piano recital whose stressed he hasn't slept for three days.But that night when our home invader kills Clare before she can say goodbyes to her sorority sisters and her boyfriend Chris and hides her body in the attic, and her father comes to meet her at the appointed time at the university, well, it puts a damper on everyone's holiday weekend plans because Clare will soon be officially a missing persons report on Christmas Eve.Between harassing obscene phone calls Mrs Mac, Barb, and Phyllis are forced to delay plans and reluctantly play host to Mr Harrison taking turns even. Jess goes to the conservatory to drop the big bomb on poor Peter before his recital no less, she is pregnant and wants an abortion. Peter disagrees and believes it is a choice they both need to make but his argument doesn't make much head way and Jess makes him promise to stop by the sorority house after the recital to discuss their future plans in greater detail. Hey, there is a pattern here stay tuned.Christmas Eve, Claude the cat found Clare and is kind enough to lead Mrs Mac to it. Clare is officially reported missing to Lt Fuller (John Saxon). Lt Fuller organizes a large search party of volunteers and police to comb a local park and the surrounding neighborhoods with the assistance of Jess, Barb, Phyllis, Chris, and Mr Harrison. They find a dead body of a girl but no Clare. Peter bombs his recital. Returning back to the sorority house it is evident to our trio of girls that Mrs Mac has left the building. Barb who is nearly obscene as ""The Moaner"" finally crashes from two straight days of hard drinking. Jess receives another bad call and reports the phone stalker to the police when in steps in Peter who had been waiting upstairs. They argue Jess isn't going to give her planned future but Peter wants to give up his doesn't want to be a concert hall pianist anymore and neither wants to work at the conservatory anymore he wants to get married.Lt Fuller arrives to set up the tap passing a departing Peter, learning that the sorority house has two lines, one in the living room and hall and the other in Mrs Mac's room. He also stations a patrol car outside. Two fails to track the phone stalker but the killer drops a quote of a statement Peter made that same evening. Uh-oh. Jess and Lt Fuller are coming to the same conclusions. Lt Fuller follows this lead to a destroyed piano in the conservatory and Jess's greatest fears are allayed by Phyllis who reminds her that Peter was visiting them when the phone stalker dialed them up making him the suspect impossible.This films suffers a lot of errors in continuity and gaping plot holes. If the phone lines are only in living room, the hall, and Mrs Mac's room how is the killer moving around undetected? There isn't a phone jack in the attic. And how come the girl's failed to hear him yelling from Mrs Mac's room? And how did he leave the house, kill patrolman Jennings, and get back inside the house undetected by the sorority sisters nor the search party outside? Yeah, he could of went back down the lattice from the attic window and again back up? Still... I ain't buying it. Unless our killer is a flipping ninja yeah that is what he is. *Gives self-induced facepalm* D'oh.This is a classic slasher maybe deserves a better rating but I didn't find it all that scary, but rather silly, I didn't appreciate how forcibly determined the film chose to misdirect me. Actually, it would have been an improvement to this film if Peter did indeed suffer a mental breakdown leading to a homicidal psychosis. Keir Dullea fit the role like a hand-in-glove.",Black Christmas
254,Lord-of-Delusion,"Essential viewing for fans of horror, and thrillers alike",9,27 December 2005,"Easily the scariest movie I have ever bore witness to, even to this day, Black Christmas set the standard for the ""slasher movie."" I could drone on for hours about how much I enjoy this movie, but I'll try to keep this short. If you don't know the plot, here it is: Sorority house during X-mas break, where we learn the girls have been receiving obscene phone calls, inter-mixed with some unknown intruder scaling up a wall to an open attic window. What follows are some of the most intense, and downright harrowing phone calls, switching from sexual innuendos and pig noises, to what seems like different characters screaming out names that make no sense (not at first, anyway). The story progresses with Jess (Hussey), seeming to be the recipient of the calls, telling her boyfriend Peter (Dullea) that she is pregnant, but does not want to keep the baby. Peter flips out, and starts to act a little cuckoo himself. Enter John Saxon as Lt. Fuller, who while investigating the disappearance of a 12 yr. old girl, keeps a tab on the strange calls coming in to the sorority house. I'll leave it at that, as the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat until the harrowing ending, which answers nothing and everything at the same time. If you haven't watched this film yet, go find it now. It is well acted, intense, and at times flat out disturbing. This is proof that all the crap that's being thrown out today cannot hold a flame to a movie that was made 30 years ago, with no sex, and limited on-screen violence. What makes this movie is the fact that the killer is never shown, and you really have to pay attention to his babbling on the phone, and with your imagination you can start to piece together why this dude is really off his rocker (no pun intended!). Please keep in mind that this movie predated Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc... by quite a few years, and you can notice some of the quirks that would become standards of these types of movie. However, none have, and ever will, match the creepiness of the ""eyeball scene"" and others. It still gives me nightmares. In closing, this is more of a serial killer movie than anything else, and when you think about people like Ted Bundy who actually went into a sorority house in Florida, and killed young women, it just makes it all the more terrifying.If you have an attic, nail the door shut.9 out of 10 stars.",Black Christmas

Taking the police's help, they bug the phone and trace the call.

257,pinback-6,"Unsettling, but...",5,24 May 2000,"Being a horror film afficiando, I headed off to one of my local videostores to catch up on horror films that I ought to have seen for one reason or another. One of the films I picked up was this one, having read that it was probably the first slasher flick, which qualified it to my list. After watching it, I thought that it was very unsettling, but was it REALLY scary? And was it any good? Well, sort of. The problem with the film is that one, I couldn't care less about the characters, and when they go about acting like total idiots I even caught myself mumbling: ""if he/she/it gets killed now he/she/it's got him/her/itself to blame"". This keeps the film from really being scary, plus that, and this probably wasn't the case for the audience when it was released, the ending is so unbelievably predictable that it's plain silly.WARNING! SPOILER!I mean, if you have a long cameraroll that drifts from he bed where the heroine lies across the hall, doesn't that give it all away? And they basically signal that it's coming, I mean, why else would everybody leave the room? I called it right when the scene started!END OF SPOILERNow, don't get me wrong, it is a pretty good film. Now it's time to compare it to the other film of this kind, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". There are similarities, but there is one significant difference. In ""Halloween"", we know who the killer is a couple of minutes in, in ""Black Christmas"" we don't. And that makes a bigger difference than one might think. One film which is a big ripoff of ""Black Christmas"" though is ""Friday the 13th"", which is built up in a similiar fashion, but is indeed a MUCH MUCH worse film. But back to ""Black Christmas"" vs ""Halloween"", the question now is, which one do I prefer? The answer is easy, I'll pick ""Halloween"" any day of the week. Why? Easy, Carpenter is a much more skilled director than Bob Clark and it shows in a major way. Clark manages to build an effective mood, but the mood Carpenter builds is more menacing than Clark could build in his dreams. SPOILER!Second of all, in ""Halloween"", the characters act more human. When they are given a chance to escape they take it, they don't go out to investigate.END OF SPOILERNext is the camerawork. It is similiar, but it's far more slick in ""Halloween"". The same goes for just about everything else in the film. But back to just ""Black Christmas"", the film is definitely worth the price of rental, since it is after all a sort-of classic. I personally don't think it's good enough to be classic in terms of quality, but does belong on the cult classic list since it helped spawn the genre that ""Psycho"" laid the building blocks for. But it's definitely not a masterpiece. According to me, anyway.",Black Christmas
258,sjrobb99-997-836393,Sorority girls are stalked by a shrieking psycho-killer who dispenses bloody yuletide cheer.,8,9 March 2011,"This movie scared the be-jabbers out of me, and that is saying something.The plot is simple: girls in a sorority house are menaced by a psycho killer who, for reasons known only to himself, has set up shop in their attic. It's the Christmas season and most of the girls have gone home for the holidays, but three of the sisters -- Jess (Olivia Hussey), Barb (a fabulously foulmouthed and over-the-top Margot Kidder) and Phyl (Andrea Martin) remain behind with their house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman).It seems that the house has been plagued with bizarre phone calls. Not exactly obscene, the calls tend toward ranting gibberish, insane laughter, horrible screams, and some kind of unholy crooning. The calls are one of the truly frightening things in the film; they pour out of the phone like the soundtrack to a nightmare, and you find yourself wondering why the girls don't just hang up. Sensibly, they call in the police, who come to put a tap on the phone.The first girl to disappear is Clare Harrison (Lynn Griffin), whose father sounds the alarm when she fails to meet him to be taken home for Christmas. The father, played to jittery perfection by James Edmond, spends most of the movie nervously asking cops, sorority sisters, boyfriends, and anyone else he can find, if they know what has happened to his daughter. Unbeknownst to the rest of the sisters, Clare has taken up residence in the attic, where the killer has posed her in a rocking chair with a plastic bag over her head and a baby doll in her lap.Clare is shortly joined in oblivion by Mrs. Mac, who makes the mistake of clambering up into the attic to look for her cat and ends up staying for eternity, suspended from the ceiling by a chain -- attached to a hook embedded in her throat. The psycho picks the girls off in a leisurely way, eventually leaving only the luminously beautiful Olivia Hussey -- who, according to the Horror Film Rules of Conduct, should be a victim of the killer because of a subplot involving the fact that she is pregnant and wants to have an abortion. She argues with her boyfriend, Peter (in one memorable exchange, he calls her a selfish bitch and accuses her of aborting the baby ""...like you were having a wart removed!""); Jess eventually comes to suspect that Peter may be the killer because the killer begins incorporating bits of her arguments in his calls.Margot Kidder plays Barb a little too broadly for sympathy; at the beginning of the film, we discover that her mother prefers to spend Christmas with a new boyfriend (""You're a gold-plated whore, mother,"" Margot snarls into the phone, scotch in one hand and cigarette in the other); this serves to explain why Barb spends the movie drinking, smoking, dropping double-entendres, swearing like a pirate -- and having anxiety-induced asthma attacks. By the time the killer gets to her, you feel sorry for them both.There are several memorably frightening moments in the film, but one in particular will make you squirm. In a classic early-slasher-genre trick, the phone tap reveals that the obscene calls are coming from inside the house -- specifically from the housemother's bedroom -- and a terrified Jess discovers the bloodied bodies of Phyl and Barb. In the bedroom with the bodies, an eye stares at Jess from a crack in the closet door, and the voice of the killer taunts her from the darkness. Jess slams the door on the killer -- who immediately begins to shriek in a way that suggests damnation and rage unfit for human consumption. The shrieking continues as he chases Jess around the house; eventually I had to mute the TV because I seriously could not listen to the shriek. It was that horrible.The end of the movie is as bleak as the contents: Jess kills Peter with a fireplace poker because she thinks he's the killer; the police break in and find Jess and the dead Peter in the basement. A doctor sedates Jess and puts her to bed, then insists on getting poor hapless Mr. Harrison to a hospital (""This man is suffering from shock!"" -- which made me want to say ""Dude, what do you think that GIRL is suffering from?"") leaving Jess alone and sleeping in a darkened room.As the police cars leave, posting only a single cop as a guard, the killer climbs, chuckling, back down out of the attic and the phone begins to ring.The movie is atmospherically creepy, and the voice of the psycho is enough to give a person nightmares forever; there are a few spots where the director took the easy way out (""The calls are coming from inside the house!"" prominent among them) but on the whole this is a hell of an effective horror movie.",Black Christmas

262,rabiddog67,Better Than Halloween,10,14 January 2004,"BLACK CHRISTMAS is one of the best of the horror genre and HALLOWEEN, although a great film itself, borrows much from this film - John Carpenter was friends with Bob Clark and even had asked Clark if he was going to do a sequel. Bob Clark, director of the excellent CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS and DEATHDREAM, told Carpenter that he was not going to do a sequel, but, if he was, it would be called HALLOWEEN. Carpenter's opening is very similar in style to Clark's opening, as if the killer POV camera work and the killer lurking out of the frame. Olivia Hussey is not the virginal heroine (her character is pregnant and determined to abort the baby) and a lot of film books and reviews incorrectly identify Keir Dullea as the killer when he is obviously not. I have heard complaints regarding the ending and the unknown identity of the killer because most viewers have been conditioned to have everything explained to them & tied up in a neat little package, a la the ending of PSYCHO, but that only makes the film more unique. It was one of the first and the acting is superb for this type of effort. In a fair world it would be every bit as popular as HALLOWEEN, but given the amount of posts for this film, it shows that BLACK CHRISTMAS is very much appreciated by horror fans. I read an interview with Bob Clark on FANGORIA'S web site that a remake of BLACK CHRISTMAS is in the works, as well as a remake of DEATHDREAM and either a remake or sequel to CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS. Another great Bob Clark film worth checking out is MURDER BY DECREE, in which Sherlock Holmes takes on the Jack the Ripper slayings. It's a shame that Clark turned his back on the horror genre after BLACK CHRISTMAS and directed crap like the PORKY'S movies and LOOSE CANNONS. If he would have kept his hand at horror, I predict that he would have been one of the biggest names in the field today.",Black Christmas

It starts as harmless background noise and, by the conclusion, becomes an ominous sign of horror lurking just upstairs. Olivia Hussey, Andrea Martin, and Margot Kidder star as sorority sisters plagued by increasingly threatening phone calls and eventually a mysterious and brutal killer. Though the film is utterly simple and lacks any thorough explanations of the killer's identity or motive, it is surprisingly effective in how it takes just a handful of elements and combines them to create an undeniably frightening film. In the end, it doesn't need to unmask the person committing the murders, and for very good reason; what he does is far more horrifying than who he is.",Black Christmas

The premise of this hugely influential shocker, which is one of several films credited with starting the stalk-n-slash genre, sounds silly, because how can he do all the things he does without any of the girls noticing? But Roy Moore's screenplay and intelligent actually turn this problem into an asset by the murder juxtaposing with - among others - the girls laughing very loud about a present they've just given to their landlord and a group of young kids singing Christmas Carols. Not only does it explain why the murder goes unnoticed, it also adds some very dark, sardonic humor to the proceedings.

265,Lionel M.,Lovers of John Carpenter's Halloween will love this film even more.,7,17 April 2000,"When I rented this film around the Christmas season of 1999, I did not know what to expect. The only reason why I rented it was that Olivia Hussey and Keir Dullea were in the leading roles (I have a strange and sick obsession with Olivia Hussey and I liked Keir Dullea in 2001). But then when I first watched it that dark and cold Saturday night, I was amazed.The film's style was very dark and mysterious, as well as bizarre. While watching the film, I saw where John Carpenter might have gotten a lot of his filming technique from his 1978 classic, Halloween (one of my personal favorites). It, like Halloween, involves the murders of young women. And in the case of Black Christmas, it's sorority girls.
What set this apart from Halloween is that the killer is less human than Michael Myers. You saw Michael Myers, but you do not see the killer in Black Christmas. Plus the killer is insane, especially when he rants. His rants make no sense, making his intentions unknown. He just kills, not for revenge like most horror films. But he just kills. I don't know about you, but that is what makes this film even scarier, aside from the spooky musical score.They say that Jamie Lee Curtis is the ""scream queen."" Well whoever thinks that obviously has not heard Olivia Hussey's lungs in action. That woman can SCREAM.It's best if you watch this film alone in a quiet house at night during the Christmas season. I did that the second time I watched it. I tell you the truth, I had a hard time walking downstairs to go to the bathroom I was so scared. And no horror film has ever done that to me since the first time I saw Scream about three years ago.Some may argue that the characters in the film are not very developed, but that does not matter because most of them die anyway. One of the few characters that stood out in this film was Barb (Margot Kidder). She is a drunk, trash-talking sorority girl who manages offend just about everybody. The woman who played the sorority house mother, Mrs. Mac (Marion Waldman), also stood out as a trash-talking, drunken woman. Olivia Hussey's character is a bit snobbish, like any sorority girl, but not to her other sisters. Keir Dullea's character is high-strung and unpredictable, which adds to the film mysterious style. But as for the rest, there really was no room for them to grow. Besides, like I just stated, most of them get killed off anyway.The end really surprised me. I mean, really. No questions asked. It even shocked me, but I'm going to spoil it for anyone. But if you loved John Carpenter's Halloween, you'll love this film even more. I guarantee it.",Black Christmas

268,bensterpiszczek,What emerged in 1974 as modestly successful on a low-budget resurfaces as one of the most disturbing films ever made 40 years later. A true cult classic worthy of recognition.,10,26 December 2020,"Sometime after I became reacquainted with horror films during Halloween season in 2017- about a month after I saw IT in theaters- I was up late in the living room one night after my parents went to bed and browsing through a horror and B-movie streaming service when I came across Black Christmas (1974). I did not know what to expect, but what followed the next 100 minutes not only didn't disappoint me like most modern films do, it actually managed to DISTURB me a bit and keep me away from the attic for about a week. With that, I believe that Black Christmas stood the test of time and may very well be one of the most disturbing films ever made. Black Christmas is truly a great horror film worthy of recognition.Directed by Benjamin Robert ""Bob"" Clark (of A Christmas Story fame) after two other low-budget horror films (Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things in 1972 and Deathdream A.K.A. Dead Of Night in 1974), Bob Clark reached the height of his horror career with this film, as it manages to go above and beyond in terms of story, cinematography, editing, acting, dialog, and soundtrack. Black Christmas was initially released on October 11th, 1974 in Canada before being released in the United States on December 20th later that same year under the title ""Silent Night, Evil Night"". It was later rereleased in American theaters on December 26th, 1975 bearing the title we all know and love.First, the STORY. Black Christmas tells the tale of college girls who are staying at a sorority house during the holidays when a stranger with some form of psychosis sneaks and breaks into said house through the attic (where The Stranger, dubbed ""Billy, spends the majority of the entire film) and eventually starts to kill them off one by one. Unlike Clark's last two films, the idea behind the antagonist isn't supernatural like a zombie or vampire, but rather something very close to a mentally-ill person with a home invasion involved. This approach WORKS, as it is a concept that is grounded in reality. It COULD happen to someone in real life. This becomes nightmarish when at the end of the film, little is revealed and we still know close to nothing about ""Billy""- his motivations, backstory, and what he LOOKS like all withstanding. Making the killer as enigmatic as possible was another thing that worked; it really enforces the idea that the unknown is terrifying.Then, we have the EDITING. The film sets the tone right away using two of your five senses with a long and aged shot of the house with eerie Christmas carolers singing ""Silent Night, Holy Night"" in the background as the title fades in with the opening credits. THIS is how you establish an ominous and atmospheric mood. It WORKS. Bob Clark's Black Christmas is a VERY dark and disturbing motion picture, and it has been said that John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) started out as a POTENTIAL SEQUEL to this film. Carpenter and Clark were discussing the film while working on an unmade/unreleased project, where Carpenter asked (Clark) if there was going to be a sequel, and what it would be about. Clark told him that he had no plans to do a sequel, but if there were to be one, the Stranger/killer would've eventually been caught and would've escaped from a mental asylum on Halloween the following year...and he would call it ""Halloween"". The Halloween that materialized in 1978 had a catchy minimalist soundtrack that is iconic amongst horror fans, but Black Christmas's soundtrack (by Carl Zittrer) was constructed using a piano with forks, combs, and knives onto the strings of it to warp the sound keys, as well as distort the sound further by recording the sounds onto an audiotape and make the sound slower. If this isn't a well composed piece of minimalist music, I don't know what is. I also want to point out that the smallest things, such as the distant sound of a dog barking in the background adds on to the unnerving nature of the film. I can't fully explain it, but it WORKS.Next, we have the CINEMATOGRAPHY. Right after the opening credits, a shaky POV shot (later used in Halloween) is shown approaching the house, climbing a trellis into the attic, and lurking around the house. We mostly see the killer as a shadow on the wall in some shots and his POV in others. the former is especially effective during the shot where the killer is carrying his first victim up to the attic. We are shown the first floor from the stairs as the camera pans up, revealing The Stranger's walking legs as he walks out of frame, leaving us with only his shadow carrying the body and eerie sound effects in the background. The most iconic scenes that are the CLOSEST we get to ever seeing ""Billy"", we see him about to stab someone with his ENITRE BODY (sans left eye) framed in shadow, and we later see that same eye peeking through a crack in the door. This approach strengthens the enigmatic nature of the character, and that works too. Another scene that disturbs me the more I think about it, is a scene after his second kill where he abruptly starts SCREAMING and TRASHING the attic (shown through POV) OUT OF NOWHERE. This particular moment is one of the most disturbing scenes in the film.The ACTING and DIALOG. The characters aren't poorly written and have some development at best, while certain others are disposable. Our (deconstructed) final girl Jessica Bradford (Olivia Hussey) is pregnant by her boyfriend Peter (Keir Dullea) and wants to get an abortion despite his urging against it, thus setting him up as an effective red-herring. (Margot Kidder)'s Barb steals to show as she (and to a bigger extent, the house mother) spend most of the movie getting drunk and becoming memorable out of it. John Saxon and the other actors did an excellent job. Their dialog is well-written and adds depth to the characters. ""Billy""/The Stranger, on the other hand, interacts almost exclusively with the other characters through a series of nonsensical yet disturbing obscene phone calls. The noises he makes on the phone are HORRIFYING, partially because it seems as if multiple voices are coming through the other line mixed in with grotesque-sounding animal noises.In conclusion, Bob Clark's Black Christmas is an underrated classic that is worthy of the recognition it gets, and personally deserves more, ESPECIALLY considering that Halloween (1978) wouldn't have existed without it. The combination of the overall tone, music, acting, and special effects make Black Christmas into a well-crafted masterpiece, and even though it's been nearly 50 YEARS since it's initial release, it STILL holds up as a film.If you plan on buying a copy, look no further than the Scream Factory 2-disc Collector's Edition from 2016. It includes a restoration of the original negative and interchangeable audio set-up on the first disc, and a bonus disc with the 2008 Critical Mass Blu-Ray and EVERY special feature included in past home video releases. A true essential in terms of a Christmas movie gift.",Black Christmas
269,The_Pat_Bateman,"Overlooked Classic, one of the best horror movies ever",10,2 December 2005,"OK, I am a big fan of horror, and I love slashers. i have seen so many, and yes like many others I believe the 80s produced the best slashers. I am a gorehound, I love gory movies. I am usually disappointed when there is little gore.I watched Black Christmas about 1 year ago, and it instantly became one of my favorite horror movies. There is little gore, but the film makes up for that.It starts out at a sorority house right before winter break. Some of the girls start disappearing one by one, what they don't know right away though, is that there is a killer in the house, and he has been in there longer than they think This movie is great from start to finish. The ""the call is coming from inside the house"" originated from this movie. The calls are some of the creepiest, craziest, most lunatic stuff you will ever hear.I would say this is a must see for horror fans, slasher or otherwise. This is one of the earliest slashers, so it is cool to see where films got inspiration from. This is a severely underrated classic, and I seriously think every horror fan should check it out",Black Christmas
270,snafflemonkey,Horror Classic,10,25 February 2007,"Although the recent remake was a fairly enjoyable film in its own right, it is no where near as effective as the original film. I don't think that the similar ties to this and Halloween matter all that much they are different enough and they each build up the atmosphere of dread in their own way.I think that Black Christmas is the better film, the acting and direction in this film is excellent and the film takes its time to build the sense of danger rather than have the killer hacking his victims from the opening credits. The murders in this film are also more effective than in the remake because you don't see that much, the violence is implied rather than shown and it is far more shocking than anything in the remake.The fact that you don't know who Billy is or why he is stalking the girls in the house makes him a far more creepy and disturbing killer than those in the films that have followed Black Christmas - the unknown is far more scary than what you see, hence why all the slasher sequels in the 80's and 90's where not really that good when they start to focus more on the killer and less on the victims.The ending was nice and vague and I'm glad there was never a sequel as it allows you to ponder what happened after the credits rolled. To me the film has aged very well, even if the quality of the picture hasn't whether those who are used to the made slashers and repulsive gore of recent films will like it I don't know, but for me this is a classic well worth seeing.",Black Christmas

(We all know Hollywood.)Firstly, if someone wants to make a mid 1970s nostalgia film, and you're in charge of set decoration, or wardrobe, this is a great film to study. No over the top trends, just spot on real sets and costuming.Secondly, I don't think I have ever seen so many real firsts in one film. Everything eventually shows up in Hollywood years later. Really amazing when you see so many franchise ideas packed into a single film.I found the casting interesting also. Lots of folks you'll recognize for sure.What you will not see is a lot of special effects blood and gore, but you will get an earful of profanity that may offend folks with what I call a ""PC ear.""

274,TheSwedishJFK,Still a jolly good slasher,7,14 December 2020,"I have heard a lot of Black Christmas. But unfortunately, I saw the remake first. When I finally came around to see the real deal from 1974, I was not disappointed.Many have said it, but I cannot do nothing else but agree. It sure is groundbreaking. The plot is quite silly with an all-girls sorority house that is stalked by a psycho killer. We follow the protagonist Jess, who in some ways are one of the first ""final girls"" ever.As the film progresses, one after the other of the girls and some other unfortunates are getting killed. They also believe that this someone is behind some very disturbing phone calls that the girls frequently are receiving.
The tone of the movie makes up for the plot though. It has a good mix between fun dialogue mixed with stable horror sequences. Most of the fun is credited to the housemother Mrs. Mac who is played by Marian Waldman. Mrs. Mac drinks, swears and is all-round fun to watch. She gives the movie so much when everyone else is more serious but have very boring and colorless characters.The real strength to Black Christmas is how its crafted. The camera is used in groundbreaking ways when it functions as the first-person point of view of the killer. The well-made movements of the camera make you feel that you see through the killer's eyes. Ways that are still used to this day. But here it was fresh. It gives it that horror feeling we all have learned to love. Another strength is the sound. The year before in 1973, former Oscar-winner Mercedes McCambridge did a legendary effort as a voice actor to give us the horrifying voice of a demon in The Exorcist. I would say that the voice of the killer in this Christmas classic is in the same class. It is so well-made and horrifying. The kills in the movie are gruesome for 1974 but not in today's standard. But that voice is still so creepy, freaky, and disturbing. Good job.But even if much of the film is still well made in the eyes of a modern audience there are some instances that really shows that it was made over 40 years ago. For example, one of the girls gives a little kid alcohol at a Christmas party and fellatio is still a word not everyone knows.The conclusion is this. It is a well-crafted movie but with a thin story. But what the film really excelled in is effectively portraying a killer with the help of camera and sound. It sure is an important work of art for the horror genre, but especially for the subgenre slasher which it helped create.",Black Christmas

This movie is really creepy as the P.O.V shots show you what the killer is watching. I mean really creepy.The story centers on 4 sorority sisters, Jess, Barb, Phyllis, and Claire. Also involved in the story is 3 boyfriends, Peter, Chris, and Patrick, a drunker house mother, Mrs.MacHenry, and Lt. Fuller and Sgt. Nash.

Keir Dullea, John Saxon, Marian Waldman, and Lynne Griffin did good too. This movie blends together a dark frightening atmosphere, p.o.v shots, and some of the most frightening scenes in horror cinema, to create Black Christmas, a frightening horror movie that will keep you guessing from beginning to end, and have you actually be frightened for the characters, who you know are being stalked.Just don't go into watching it expecting a lot of gore, b/c the movie is based on suspense.This movie is definitely worth the $15 plus shipping on amazon.com.

Well, I realize that ""Black Christmas"" was 4 years before ""Halloween""...this is true. But, folks, after viewing ""Black Christmas"" it still is NOTHING compared to ""Halloween""!! Anyone can come up with a good plot idea for a slasher and/or low budget horror flick. It takes the right actors, but more importantly the right cinematography, lighting, music, colors, sets, etc...that truly make the movie. I'm sorry, but ""Halloween"" still rules as the ""granddaddy"" of slasher flicks! ""Black Christmas"" was a fun and entertaining slasher to watch...but most of the time I was laughing and found it funny. Margot Kidder was hilarious and the rest of the cast had their silly or funny moments as well. The only two true freaky and pretty scary aspects to the movie were the first kill (the guy popping out of the closet with the plastic clothes cover) and the phone calls and/or the bizarre/terrifying voices and/or things said to the girls when they answered. Other than that, this thriller was not that scary nor did it really have me on the edge of my seat.""Halloween"" truly was terrifying and much more ""realistic"". It used freaky lighting, bizarre music (the unforgettable theme), and much scarier kills than ""Black Christmas"". Therefore, it was much more popular and remembered...making it an instant cult-classic. Because of that it also will always be viewed as the real jump-start to the slasher genre. Don't get me wrong, I loved ""Black Christmas"" and enjoy watching it too--as I'm a horror fan and ""BC"" is one of my favorite editions. But...""Halloween"" is still in a whole different realm and a cut above the rest of the other slashers--and will always be the alpha and omega of ""Boogey Man"" flicks! ;-)",Black Christmas
278,louisb-399-524629,A Well-Done Horror/Thriller Film,7,7 July 2013,"I don't know if this review will have spoilers, but just in case I thought I better warn of the possibility. The acting in this picture is excellent, and the movie is not only scary, but sometimes downright funny as well. Olivia Hussey is an excellent lead, although I couldn't tell if she was attempting an American accent at times(She's actually British). Margot Kidder was very,very good. I must be honest and say that two things bothered me about the picture, and kept it from achieving greatness.One was the fact that the picture clearly attempts to pin the murders on one particular character, so much so that it soon becomes obvious that this person could not be the killer. Otherwise, the movie couldn't surprise us at the end with a different revelation. I think that if the movie had presented other characters as possible suspects, it would've worked better. The second problem for me was the behavior of the Olivia Hussey character at a key moment after she receives a phone call containing information that is crucial to her being able to exit the house alive. While 9 out of 10 people would've taken that information and literally run with it, she astoundingly does the exact opposite, making her a prime candidate for a Darwin Award in my opinion. Although one could say that she was only thinking of her friends in those moments, her behavior was a complete bummer for me, and caused me to lose sympathy for her. Apart from those 2 issues, the picture worked for me. Again, I must comment on how good the acting is. You simply don't see such good work very often in a horror picture. The direction is also quite good, with some great atmosphere. How did Bob Clark go from this to sleazy trash like Porky's?",Black Christmas

280,filmguy_07,"God love Bob Clark for making great Christmas movies, whether there's death or not!",10,4 April 2007,"With the typically silly state of slasher movies today, considering that most of any of the popular ones are sit-'n-slash (Hostel, Wolf Creek, Turistas, you get the idea), it's nice to take a travel back in time when slashers were about mystery and the chase, not some hapless victim tied down to a chair with a chainsaw blade being fed into his or her rectum. Hell, Cube & Saw kind of got the ball rolling on that, but at least those people had SOME kind of chance of living. Thanks a lot, Eli Roth. But I digress.Ah, the 70's slasher film. Is there anything more pure? Before the 80's came in and Friday the 13th perverted the original depth into mindless splatterfests, the slasher film moved on mood and atmosphere (Texas Chainsaw Massacre excluded, that movie is just f***in awesome). Bob Clark's Black Christmas takes the horror to not only a supposedly harmless environment such as the sorority house, but also to a holiday more harmless than baby holding a puppy that's licking a bunny. This harmless environment, in turn, gives the film and even more terrifying feeling, as if it was invading a world that God never intended it to cross into.All slasher villains have to have a gimmick, and have needed one ever since Michael Myers donned his stylish emotionless white mask. And although Myers will always be my favorite, Billy by far is the most intimidating one I've ever seen... er, ""seen."" Why? Because all he is is a voice, an eye, and a shadow. That's it. When's the last time you watched a horror movie and didn't see the monster? Billy has no gimmick, and he doesn't need one, because he is f***in creepy all on his lonesome. He doesn't even have a standard weapon! Don't worry, I won't tell Agnes what we did.As far as the acting is concerned, stellar performances all around. John Saxon was way on in the movie, more than he was in A Nightmare on Elm Street (easily). Margot Kidder was a great drunk (I'm sure she's experienced). To the main point: I was concerned for the safety of EVERY character, a MAJOR rarity in the slasher film. There's usually at least one or two meat puppets you're couldn't care less about, but not a single one in Black Christmas. If you can find one, tell me who it is! Black Christmas is everything that I wish slasher films today would be. Moody, dangerous, dreadful, and with more depth than just a knife into the chest, Black Christmas easily presents what the slasher movie needs to recapture.

As the first scene started i was moaning about how stupid and predictable it was when the girl wandered over to the closet when it rattled. When she solves it i let my guard down, and jumped a meter of my seat (no exaggeration) when the killer appears from nowhere and slaughters her. (previous to watching this i watched Ammytiville horror with out flinching) weirdly, i clapped at how it made me jumped.As the film progressed i became more joyful as the kills became increasingly twisted. (something i seek for when watching slashers) Another reason this movie is good is because the plot is original, unlike most 70's/80's horror's. The only reason i didn't score this movie a perfect ten is because their is a lack of character development in my opinion, with non of the girls in the house being a sole victim or taking a lead in the film. One last thing i put Black Christmas down on is the obvious lack of comedy, with all the film being directly focused on the plot with not many, or no, jokes, puns or funnies.

286,EtherealMind,A highly underrated movie!,7,23 June 2011,It's hard to believe this movie was made in 1974 - In my opinion it is way ahead of its time. I'm perplexed as to why this movie isn't talked about more in the horror genre. For its time I think it's extremely innovative and definitely would've been a massive inspiration for John Carpenter when he made Halloween four years later. The beginning of the 1978 Halloween is definitely influenced by the beginning to this movie where we have a POV shot of the mysterious killer making his way into the house. This movie can be somewhat slow in parts but if you stick with it you'll find it enjoyable. The tension throughout this movie is incredible. There are some scenes where the camera is just fixed on the attic door and strange noises can be heard coming from there. Very creepy. I'd strongly recommend this movie to people who enjoy the Halloween movies or films that keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.,Black Christmas

The whole chase scene down the steps afterward is edge of your seat material, some of the best I've ever experienced. Especially when you think Jessica is completely out of harms way, and the killers arm comes out of nowhere trying to grab her! I still freak at that scene! Enough could never be said at how amazingly eerie the phone calls are, even uneasy at times. The switching of voices sends chills down my back.Another great moment is Margot Kidder's death, while the Christmas caroling continues outside the house.There are a couple of plot holes that bugged me a bit...Okay, why on earth would Peter (Jessica's boyfriend) ever go looking for her in the basement of the sorority house at the end? You hear him yelling outside before he breaks out a window, but that doesn't make sense. Even if the doors were locked and he was yelling for Jessica, he already broke in once before (when Jessica and the others were at a search party for Clare), and it was never indicated that they weren't locked that time. Even so, it still makes no sense what so ever that he would look in the run down basement that looks like none of the girls have ever stepped a single foot in. I feel this entire scene was just made to make Peter look like the most ultimate Red Herring, but I think enough evidence was already pointing to him to totally steer the viewer away from the twist ending.Another thing that got to me was how they build John Saxon to act like a convincingly real cop, only to later make the whole police force to look like a bunch of backwoods Rosco P. Coltrane rejects. Early on Saxon is doing what a lot of cops do, asking questions that had already been answered. Like when he asked of the last time who and when someone had seen Clare, he said ""Last time she was seen was this morning"" when Jessica had already stated it was the night before. Subtle little bits like that won me over...What didn't was these cops knowing there is a second phone line in the house, and they didn't even think of that from the get go? Better yet, once they realized the calls WERE coming from the house, they never thought of checking the attic, or not even once looked for it? Come on! It was right above the girls rooms! Nevertheless, I did love the downbeat last five minutes of the movie. I guess many people felt cheated with the outcome, I kinda thought it was genius, I just didn't think the whole last ordeal with Peter and Jessica was needed at all for the ending to be so effective. Peter could've entered the house in a more believable way...",Black Christmas

Don't be fooled by the lovers of this film who say it's better; while good, it's definitely not near the classic that Halloween is.Olivia Hussey just does not demonstrate the same fear that Jamie Lee Curtis does and John Saxon appears too cool as a cumber to match the ""everyone needs to be afraid"" distraught characterization that Donald Pleasance brought to his authority figure.Margot Kidder, however, shines as the comic relief, better than the similar characters in Halloween. But finally, the killer just does not create the same sense of doomsday that Michael Myers does.All in all, an entertaining and early slasher film for which it deserves credit, but it's not the opus that some reviewers would have you believe.",Black Christmas

But as it turned out it isn't. When I first viewed this film in early 2001 I didn't think it would be as good as I was told. The film mesmerizing.The way the film was shot was so original but is copied by later horror films like ""Halloween"". The plot of the story was good and was scary but is copied later. The film is largely overlooked as a horror film but it is worth the watch. Olivia Hussey""s performance is way better than the over the top Jamie Lee Curtis who unlike Olivia can't live up to her beauty and elegance of the role. Even though they are two different characters you can tell which one is copying who.The terrifying conclusion is well worth the wait and is a thrill ride you won't soon forget.

Thanks Mr. Clark!",10,13 April 1999,"I was only 9 when I first watched to this wonderful, unforgettable, mysterious picture and I felt in LOVE with it. The second time, I got it on a secondary channel, here in Italy, but it was 4:00 a.m. so my father had to throw me out of my bed in order to watch to it again after a long, desperate wait. Now I'm grown up but I never get tired to talk about it. During my short life, I have watched to a lot of slasher and thriller movies but none of them could compete with this. You can't say you really know this genre if you haven't seen this movie. There are a lot of gimmicks and emblems that you can get about it: the attempts to trace the source of the phone calls, the phone calls themselves, Jesse's slowly climb up the stairs with the fireplace pocket in her hands, her lonely fight and run from the killer through the empty, old house towards the basement, the killer's shapes and his frightening and staring EYE behind the door, his hide-and-seek in the attic and his hysterical personality. All this means a great proof in the history of the Cinema. The cast is all perfect, the colours are brilliantly composed and I have a special devotion to Mr. CLARK, the director, simply a genius. My compliments to his courage facing problems like abortion and violence between guys, on Campus. All my recognitions to the incomparable and beautiful Hussey's performance. Thanks to this movie, you can now appreciate films like "" Hallowen"", "" When A Stranger Calls"","" Friday the 13th"", ""Scream""... All these are ITS sons.

291,kurt_cobain_2794,Legitimately Spine Chilling Horror,10,19 December 2018,"While having grown in popularity and recognition in the past years, Black Christmas is an under appreciated horror gem from director Bob Clark, the same who would later bring the much beloved A Christmas Story. This I feel is a better film, capturing a more timeless sense of Christmas cheer than the overly sentimental Christmas Story, but putting a psychotic murder mystery twist on the season.Black Christmas is set in a sorority house as the holiday break sees most of the residents leave to spend time with family, with a few staying behind to look after the house. However a deranged stalker takes refuge in the home with them, making obscene disturbing phone calls and picking off the remaining residents one by one. The characters are well written and performed authentically, all are smart and interesting making you care for them (unlike a lot of horror movies these days), and the casting is amazing. Olivia Hussey plays Jess, who has a secret between her and her boyfriend Peter (played by Keir Dullea, Dave from 2001 A Space Odyssey), Margot Kidder as the crass alcoholic Barb, Andrea Martin (pre SCTV stardom) as the reasonable yet timid Phyl, Marian Waldman as the frumpy boozing house mother Mrs Mac (easily steals a lot of scenes with her secret sherry stashes), and John Saxon as the police lieutenant Ken Fuller investigating the harassing calls.The film is innovative in more than just being a prototype to the future slasher genre which would explode in the 70's and 80's, with first person POV shots from the killer, a goosebump inducing experimental soundtrack made up broken piano sounds that creeps throughout, and some tropes that would later become famous with films like When a Stranger Calls and Halloween. There is also little blood through out the movie, with some kills being more about tension than execution as they build up to the moment. The film is a slow burn in tension with characters becoming uneasy over days as well as the phone calls getting more personal and insane, so if you're looking for a gory kill a minute horror you might not be very impressed with this film.However if you're looking for a creepy Christmas horror to experience this year I'd gladly recommend you check out this unique early slasher. And don't bother with the remake, even if you're looking for gory kill a minute horror it does not deliver and is absolutely bland in comparison.",Black Christmas
292,DesperateHouseboy,An absolute classic!,10,5 March 2012,"I absolutely love this movie. Its one of the first real 'slasher' films, and very well done. Its about a group of sorority girls who receive menacing phone calls on Christmas break, and eventually begin getting picked off one by one, by an unseen killer who has been hiding in the attic of their sorority house. The plot seems simple, but it is a very great creepy horror flick, that paved the way for the many slasher movies to come in the 1980's, and deserves more attention that it surprisingly, doesn't get. The phone calls through out the movie are very creepy, and the movie is very atmospheric, and its clear this was an inspiration for John Carpenters horror classic, Halloween, which is much more well known. While I love both of these films, I'm going to go ahead and say BLACK Christmas is better. If you enjoyed Halloween, then you will most likely enjoy this as well. This is a horror classic, that should be seen by everyone, even if they aren't horror fans.",Black Christmas

But as soon as the killer starts to kill one by one... the movie was very interesting........You need to have more patience to watch the movie...

It's low-budget, dark, Canadian feel, makes it that much more creepy. It's well acted with a great cast, especially Margot Kidder. I'm sure it seems a bit dated by today's big budget standards, but that adds to the appeal of this classic. Although I have not seen this movie in quite a while now, many of the terrifying scenes linger in my head. I still cannot sing ""Bye Baby Bunting"" to my kids!

Having worked in mental health, Billy's rage, hatred of women etc seems plausible (although exaggerated for dramatic reasons).It might seem slow paced with a lack of gore for some tastes, but I like my horror subtle and dark.My favourite DVD release of this is the critical mass special edition, although Dan Duffin's new release last year is well worth checking out, as is Australian release with the retro documentary (the name of that escapes me at the moment)Also check out www.itsmebilly.com",Black Christmas

Still scary and effective 32 years later,9,4 January 2007,"Black Christmas easily marked the beginning of the slasher genre heavily influencing films such as Halloween, When a Stranger Calls and Scream. and tons of other films have ripped it off as well. This is probably one of the best horror films ever made with an A list cast, perfect direction from underrated director Bob Clark (Porky's, A Christmas Story, Murder by Decree), Top Nauch Screenplay by Roy Moore, scary cinematography and an even scarier score. PLOT: A group of sorority girls at Christmas time are receiving disturbing creepy phone calls from an unknown person. when one of the girls mysteriously disappears, the girls worry and contact the police who don't take them seriously. when a 13yr old girl turns up dead, the police finally take the girls seriously as more disturbing phone calls happen, among other things. truly a terrifying scary film with one of the best endings for a horror film ever made. I saw an interview with the great Olivia Hussey (Romeo & Juiliette, Jesus of Nazareth, Death on the Nile, etc.) who played heroine Jess Bradford and she said it best. its what you don't see in horror films is whats really scary. the idea of something happening as to opposed to todays horror films that point blankly shove the killer down your throat with gore to boot. not thats bad but not every single film. I my self prefer a scary gory film and this is not gory but boy is it scary. Olivia Hussey, Kier Dulliea (2001 a space Odyssey) and Margot Kidder (Superman, The Amityville Horror) give the best and most effective performances. highly recommended.

Someone must have seen this movie when they cast him as the cop/father in ""Nightmare on Elm St."" Be sure to see Kidder in the hysterical FELATIO-9... scene. I take 1 off out of 10 only because there's no closure (anti-climatic) and it doesn't really explain what the killer's deal is. I can't believe they're remaking it.

There is not a lot in common between the two movies that I can think of: madman killing people, heavy breathing/mysterious killer and nice POV camera work. I liked the POV in this movie, but it wasn't as effective as in Halloween because we see from the killer perspective before he commits a murder, therefore there was not really any suspense in those scenes, since we know where the killer is. In Halloween, the POV is used to create suspense when the killer is prowling, but it's not used before the murders, the fear of the unknown is what works best for me in those cases.Also, some people seem to think this movie invented POV in horror movies or the slasher flick. This is far from the truth, people should check some of Mario Bava's work or Peeping Tom. It was still an interesting stepping stone for the genre, but nothing innovative.Still, I found the first half chilling and interesting, but after a few murders, the movie became a little tedious because of the dumb script and predictable plot in the second half. Still, this movie gave me some chills in the first 30 minutes, I liked the bleak ending and the nice camera work and atmosphere, so it all adds up to a superior horror movie, well worth seeing but not quite a classic.7/10",Black Christmas

304,jeffoneonone,"Good, but far from great horror thriller (SPOILERS HEREIN!!!)",6,24 November 2005,"Black Christmas was a good movie. In fact, it could have reached Hitchcockian greatness if not for two flaws: 1.) Why did the police decide Peter was the killer after Jess killed him? Hadn't it already been established that he had been in the room when one of the calls had been made? This is more than a nitpicky point -- it shakes the foundations of the whole story.2.) Now, this one is more subjective. I had trouble rooting for Jess because she was such a vicious ice queen. In all honesty, I felt sorry for Peter. First, his girlfriend tells him that she's pregnant, going to have an abortion, and there's no damn way she'll consider otherwise. As a result, a crucial recital goes down very badly. And on top of it all, the poor guy gets killed and he hadn't even killed anyone.Sure, the guy may have been a trifle high-strung, but Jess comes off as plain selfish. If she was planning to have an abortion and would consider no other option, why did she even bother to tell the guy, especially on the day of his recital? By the end of the movie, I was rooting for ""Billy"" to go psycho on her ass.Women with major moral flaws were often featured in Hitchcock's films. However, he worked it so we cheered for them in spite of their flaws. This movie expects us to cheer for the heroine because of them. Thirty-one years on, it doesn't wash.",Black Christmas

The atmosphere, the music, the plot, the ending... all of it is absolutely perfect.But what really creeps me out about Black Christmas is the fact that it seems like a blueprint for serial killer Ted Bundy's attack at the Chi Omega sorority house in 1978. Bundy was known for loving slasher movies and he fantasized almost 24/7 about violence against women. In fact, he was once shown the movie Friday the 13th in prison and he couldn't finish it because he got too overstimulated. So it's no stretch of the imagination to think Bundy saw this movie in 1974 and enjoyed every single minute of it.Especially if he was taking notes.So if this movie wasn't creepy enough on its own, just realize it probably served as an inspiration for one of the most notorious serial killings in American history. A lot of the details from Chi Omega are pretty darn close, particularly what happens to Margot Kidder.

In Deathdream, Bob Clark showed he can direct a horror film and here he is given a budget and better actors.  Hussey and Dullea are very good, but Kidder is excellent as a foul-mouthed alcoholic.

To start off with you have the setup with a bunch of sorority girls in a sorority house (kinda obvious). But while they have a little party our unseen killer climbs up into the attic something which at that time would have still been original and i strangely found myself freaked out by this even though it's been done before.Then we have the disturbing phone call by one that the girls have called the moaner, and the call is disturbing and extremely obscene. Then we see the first house girl die and i still don't know who made the noises.Then we have searching for the missing girl when she doesn't show up to meet her father which is worse when we already know she is dead. You then have the usual and some more depressing scenes and death of another. Another depressing thing is when Barb is killed i felt so depressed, i mean Jess is downstairs and if it weren't for the fact that she was listening to carol singers then she would have known sooner to get out of there sooner and also worn Phyllis (not sure of spelling). And when at the end she is told to get out of the house as the calls are coming inside, and she does the exact opposite and goes up the stairs, I just immediately thought that that's it for her, she is going to die. The eye scene had me freaked but not as much as the ending, I just thought so sad for her and what is even worse that the killer still being in the attic, i just didn't sleep for the next two days.This is the greatest movie ever in my opinion and if you haven't seen it and like scary, intense movies then this is perfect.",Black Christmas

It was a recommendation, 'My favourite horror movie of all time...the scariest movie I have ever seen.' So I had high hopes. I thought it might even scare me. I watched it with a friend, and by the end we both felt confused, and I was a little angry. The ending seemed almost incomplete. I didn't understand how anyone could end a movie like that. The rest of the movie was great. Good plot, incredible actors, and, although it is not a comedy by any means, there was a good deal of humour. We did enjoy it, to an extent; we walked around for week shouting 'Billy!' randomly; but we just didn't quite get it. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me, and I had to watch it again. I had to find out what was going on. I thought maybe I had missed something the first time. I didn't. But for some reason, I liked it more than the last time I had seen it. And this rings true for me each time. It just gets better and better. The ending certainly hasn't changed, but I love it now. It's the best and most shockingly unexpected ending I've seen since Sleepaway Camp. This movie has worked it's way into my head, heart, and to the top of my very long list of favourite horror movie.

I'm also one of the biggest fans of John Carpenters Halloween. It's not only my favourite horror movie of all-time, but my favourite movie of all-time period.I respect this film. It was neat. A lot of scenes I noticed were done in Halloween. It was well made. However, it wasn't scary. It didn't have major fear factors in there. One of the biggest things a slasher/horror movie needs is the killer to be intimidating or creepy.Also, a great score would've been fantastic. Unfortunately, it was missing good music as well in my opinion.This movie isn't frightening in the least bit. I got a few chills in the last 30 seconds of the film, but that's it. I don't know what all the hype is about. I respect what it has done for slasher movies, but if you can't go back, watch the film and truly be creeped out after decades, then its not a classic.This movie isn't a classic. Rather a stepping stone for art work such as John Carpenters Halloween. I would never compare Halloween to this movie. Never has a slasher/horror movie been done so well as Carpenter & Hill created Michael Myers in 1978.I could honestly say Tobe Hoopers Texas Chainsaw Massacre scares the living hell out of me until this day.

317,luray-1,Creepy and chilling!,7,3 January 2011,"Black Christmas is a truly eerie slasher movie that influenced every similar film that came after it -- and very few that came after improved upon the genre.The cinematography made every character's move add to the uneasiness in the film, as the camera gave the viewer the killer's point of view, or it followed the girls up the stairs and around the upstairs hall. The dark interiors of the sorority house, the winter gloom outside, and the blanket of snow all contributed to the creepy feeling that permeates the film. A couple things -- aside from Barb's incessant crude sex talk -- annoyed me: Mrs. Mac lost a shoe as she was being dragged into the attic -- did anyone find it? Why on earth did the police not search the attic? And what doctor or cop in his/her right mind would not have taken Jess to the hospital?When I saw Black Christmas for the first time, I was disappointed with the ending. Upon watching it again, I find the ending nothing short of brilliant. For isn't it more frightening to suspect the killer is still out there (or *in* there, as the case may be), and isn't it more chilling *not* to understand the motives for his actions?",Black Christmas

The movie was made in 1974 and that alone screams of cheese, right? Wrong! Watching this movie by myself was scary. I was alone and all the Christmas decorations had just been put up, the snow was falling and the house smelt of cinnamon. My movie watching experience was defiantly a good one. Parts of the kill's were very creepy and so were the phone calls. The comedy was hilarious, Marian Waldman made me laugh till I hurt. Margot Kidder was beautiful and witty while I found Olivia Hussey to be a tad over dramatic. Over all I have to say this movie took me by surprise and was very entertaining and well made for its time. Those who pass it by should think twice. Don't miss this Canadian classic.

319,deeva_deeva,Black Christmas,9,28 July 2007,"This film came out when I was eleven years old and I remember sneaking into the local theatre to see it, as it was rated restricted at the time. I didn't sleep for days afterward! I now own the collectors edition of film and watch it at least once a year. My 19 year old son is somewhat of a film buff himself and I had him watch it with me a few years back for the first time. He was very impressed with it as well.Margot Kidder puts in a winning performance as Barb, the lonely attractive, abusive and constantly drunk sorority sister who flirts with anything in pants. Olivia Hussey is convincing as Jess, the lead female, who has to deal with a pregnancy, a highly strung piano playing boyfriend, and a weirdo who calls on the phone.One thing that really bothered me in this film - I wish Peter would have gotten rid of that coat.

320,sodhym,Disturbing and suspenseful,8,19 February 2011,"It is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen in a while and it had this effect on me even though I watched it for the first time in 2011, after watching all kinds of horror movies throughout my life.First in a long time, I have cared for a leading character in a horror movie which, in turn, kept the tension up for me till the end. What I find most disturbing is the voice or the voices of Billy and his confused which seems to be repeating a pattern of behavior which began with a past event and seeking help at the same time (while he does not do anything about it).One point which worths discussing is the point on misogyny in Black Christmas. The movie has enough points which justifies the idea that slasher, as a genre, tends to be misogynistic at least in its tone. It is clear that the movie points out the increasing independence of women. Women in Black Christmas, including the housemother, are portrayed as decadent in some way. Even the housemother who is supposed to take care of the girls in the sorority house has an alcohol problem and does not care about the concerns of the parents.Especially the character of Barb and her murder is a classic case of punishment of a decadent woman with a phallic object - as some critiques would put it.However, leading character, Jess, is also different from the standard virgin heroine of slashers. She has a baby from a premarital sexual relationship and moreover she wants an abortion because she chooses her career over building a family. While this is true, she is also the girl seemingly most rational and reasonable.Jess is not killed at the end of the movie; however, since Billy is still in the house, it might be assumed that she will not survive the night, then we may stick to the classical interpretation of misogyny. But I think that by choosing such an independent and rational woman as its lead, movie opens the way for various interpretations.",Black Christmas

Not sure exactly what it is reflected on though. A car windscreen? The visor of one of the ski-doos?

323,Rosebud_Sled,Perfecting the art of the slow burn,9,26 December 2020,"Although the late Bob Clark is best known for his other more festive holiday film, this earlier work from almost a decade earlier is a masterpiece of film making in itself. The acting and production values aren't the greatest but the elegant camera movement, framing, editing and incredibly moody score(s) elevates it above a typical thriller.At times, the film flirts with derailment with attempts at levity. Admirably it doesn't rely on too many jump scares to achieve its objectives. Rather, simple techniques such as repeated shots of the phone, stairs and the deserted upstairs hallway contribute to the atmosphere of dread. The open ended, ambiguous conclusion is perhaps the most rewarding element of the film. No tidy, neat endings wrapped in a pretty bow here. One can easily notice the influence this film has had on another, more loudly acclaimed thriller, the original '78 Halloween.Films such as these two titles from the 70's along with the original 1960 Psycho are why I stay away from viewing any new (post 1980) horror pictures. Simply put, watching modern, mediocre attempts come at the expense of enjoying masterpieces of the past by numbing ones sense of shock, ability to be surprised and over familiarization with plot devices (the '96 Scream inadvertently made this very point).It's ironic to have discovered that the best way to get the fullest enjoyment out of horror titles is to severely limit ones exposure to them and to only select from the best.

I thought it would be a cheap b-movie. I was wrong. Some say this film was the first to set the tone for the entire slasher sub-genre and I definitely see why. All the familiar elements are there like the subjective camera shot, stabbing scene, clever and rightful suspense, and the teenage women.The one thing I loved about this film was the killer. We never see the him, that is, anything that can identify him. All you see is shots of his hands, legs, and a couples shot of his eye. We never find out who he is, there's just a passing mention that his name is Billy. Having subtlety in a villain makes them more a effective sometimes. You don't know who he is but when you feel his presence, you really do feel it. It's awesome.What I didn't like was the profanity. This film has a serious obscenities problem. The guy in the Santa suit swearing in front of children, the sorority girls cursing to police, I mean, what the heck? About half the people in this movie swear too much and this was in 1974!

I think that Black Christmas is a little bit inspired by a strange slasher film of 1973, ""Silent Night, Bloody Night"". But if B.C. has a merit, is to be original for this time, it has a twist-end and it's the first Canadian slasher, with good and popular actors (Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder and John Saxon). In 2002, the sequel from this film was supposed to be realized (by Bob Clark again, I think, and with Olivia H. and John S. back in their original role) and I was waiting with big fun for this but it didn't come (like in 1975 when B.

329,btigershark,Overlooked Classic!!,9,26 December 2007,"Before Halloween was this little Canadian shocker in the 1974 that has long been overshadowed by Halloween which in part was originally perceived as a follow up to this film.The film takes place over the Christmas holidays which makes it the prefect horror to watch at Christmas, in fact the first time i watched it was about 2 days before Christmas eve!! It revolves around an unknown psychopathic killer picking off a group of sorority girls one by one in a pretty large and spooky house.Although Halloween is still one of my favourite horror films I can't help but notice that although it has stood the test of time fairly well it is a lot less scarier than it was all those years ago. This is not the case with Black Christmas. This film was made so well in so many aspects such as the music, the premise and the photography it still scares me to this day. In fact this is the only old school slasher film which I would have no hesitation in putting on to scare the living daylights out of someone in today's modern age.I seriously urge you to watch this film if you haven't done so already as this film is guaranteed to scare the crap out of you; and what ever you do ""don't go up the stairs!""",Black Christmas

334,Kelper99,Simply one of the best -- and most underrated -- horror movies ever.,9,14 July 2001,"A brilliant work of terror and suspense which predates Halloween.  It's the simplest of stories:  a psychopath holes away in a sorority house attic and makes shockingly obscene and bizarre phonecalls to the unwitting housemates, who he proceeds to knock off one by one.  Sound like old hat?  SEE THE MOVIE.  This film understands that what we HEAR is scarier than what we SEE -- and what is hidden is more terrifying than what is revealed.  The sick phone calls, in which the killer assumes about a half dozen personalities (crying baby, nagging mother, twisted sexual deviant, scared little boy, abusive father, calm killer) compose the most frightening soundtrack since The Exorcist.  No other horror movie since has utilized sound so effectively.  Only, perhaps, The Blair Witch Project, with its use of a baby crying, demonstrated at least a partial understanding of how a single simple poignant sound effect is all you need to scare the silly putty out of the audience.   But Blair Witch is nothin' compared to ""Black Christmas.""  This movie was originally called ""Stranger in the House"" when I saw it as a kid.

I have fond memories of how much this one scared me...on the same level as the exorcist.  The thing that was the most frightening about this movie to me was how the killer accessed the house from the attic - a hole in the ceiling.  I had this same type of attic opening IN MY ROOM!  Whatever critters that lived up there kept me awake many a night wondering if there was a psycho killer in my attic just waiting for me to go to sleep so he could kill me.  I also thought the way in which Margot Kidder's character bought it was spectacular!  I've only seen this movie twice - the first time was 15 years ago and the second was 10.  I know that I am a more experienced horror watcher now and this movie might not scare me as much as it did when I was 15 (after reading all these comments I have a nostalgic yearning to see it again soon) but I will always get a delicious chill down my spine when I remember the attic opening in the ceiling.,Black Christmas

338,Mr_Jase_UK,Heavily Underrated and Overlooked Classic Slasher,10,24 September 2001,"To those of you Halloween fans, THIS is the film that came first, John Carpenter's Halloween is doused with aspects lifted directly from Bob Clark's Black Christmas. Alongside Psycho it remains one of my personal classics. Very unnearving and in parts horrific - the phone calls for instance. Basically its Christmas time, as the title suggests and an unknown killer has found his way into the attic of a sorority girls house and begins killing them one by one. Kidder's performance of the drunken, outspoken Barb is fantastic, followed closely by Olivia Hussey, who is truly beautiful in this movie. The camera work and direction is first rate, the first person perspective, heavy breathing - which most will know from Halloween, Mr Clark did it here first, and in my opinion, did it better than JC. It's not full of gore its full of suspense and wonderful creepy atmosphere, as I mentioned before, the phone calls really will put you on edge, as will the 'eye' scene. Get ready for a shocking ending and watch it again for all the bits that you didn't catch, believe me there will be some.

Though the story might seem like a terrible horror movie cliché today, Bob Clark's Black Christmas set the bar, and the mold, for the American slasher movie, and it set it extremely high. Released a full 4 years before Halloween, its impact on contemporary North American horror films cannot be overstated. The story, that of a psychotic madman terrorizing a sorority house, is simple, straightforward, and terrifiying. The twist ending has been criticized by some for its ambiguity, but I think that the final 15 minutes of this movie are superbly done and rank as some of the most frightening ever committed to celluloid.To quote a reviewer whom I think got it right, BC is ""cold, classy, and straightforward.""

340,Jerichoholics_Anonymous,"Great slasher film, one of the best, but it's no Halloween...",9,3 August 2006,"A lot of people talk about this film like it is the true unsung hero of the stalker/slasher film genre, even over the well-known and championed Halloween. I do think this is a great film and it does put most slasher films to shame, but it never comes close to honestly beating Halloween in terms of overall product.Some great directing and camera-work, not bad acting, bizarre and manic killer with no motive other than insanity and a few nice twists to keep the viewer interested make this a must-own film if you are a fan of the genre. However, I must insist, this is not quite as good as Halloween. Michael Myers' relentless and emotionless stalking beats the cackling, manic, obscene phone calling killer hands down. Add a superior soundtrack and you have a superior product, in my opinion.I noticed a few people on the IMDb making such audacious comments as: 'Halloween copied/ripped-off Black Christmas'. If I may be frank, that couldn't be more wrong. The only real similarity comes with the camera-work at the beginning of the film. This camera technique employed the pan-a-glide camera and Halloween made much better use of it and the POV shot. I can't put my finger on it and don't know exactly why but there was something distinctly wrong with the shots where we are supposed to be looking through the killer's eyes. In Halloween it felt right, in this film it felt wrong. Perhaps something to do with over-use of the technique. Halloween didn't use it quite as often and didn't have to rely on it quite so much, as it has suspense coming out of its ears from the amazing soundtrack and terrifying on-screen killer. Also, Halloween used more static camera shots watching potential victims, implying Michael Myers was watching but not confirming it, whereas in Black Christmas you KNEW he the killer was watching, because you could hear his breathing and the camera moved around much more. I know this is not the same in the opening sequence of Halloween, but throughout the rest of the film I feel the techniques are superior than Black Christmas.Still, this film IS great and if you do like Halloween, or any films of this genre, I urge you to buy this as it is brilliant.Ultimately, I think the difference is that Black Christmas is the start of the 'slasher' film genre, whereas Halloween was more a 'stalker' film. In Black Christmas, the killer never STALKS his victims. Even the female protagonist when she runs from the killer, isn't really stalked by him as such, as she hardly even runs away until the end of the film. The killer in this film waits for his victims to come to him and the suspense works in this way, where you wait for them to walk into their demise. In Halloween, the killer is actively stalking his victims, following Laurie during the day, going to Laurie's friends houses at night and killing them. So in this respect I guess that if you are more of a fan of the 'killer hiding in the closet' type of movie, this is for you, but if you are more a fan of the stalker type of movie, you will prefer Halloween. Or ask yourself this: what do you find more scary: a killer who you never actually see, even in the final stages of the film, or a silent but deadly shape, who remains off-camera until he strikes, relentlessly stalking his victim for no other reason than that he is pure Evil?But again, I really urge you to watch BOTH! Last note: Female protagonist in this film is FIT. MUCH fitter than Laurie Strode, so that's reason enough why you should watch this!",Black Christmas

342,ojbondv1,Paving the way,8,16 September 2003,"Black Christmas is a dark, chilling film set in Canada. Its Christmas time and a mysterious evil person starts making spooky phone calls to a girls sorrority house and one by one the pours souls are put away, resulting in a brand new obscene phone call for each murder. This stars Olivia Hussey (Juliet from the 60's remake of Romeo and Juliet), Margot Kidder (Clark Kents best gal). Andrea Martin (SCTV) and John Saxson as, who else, a police detective. This was ten years before Saxson appeared in his most familiar role as Nancy's dad in A Nightmare on Elm Street.  The sub-plot deals with Hussey's character, who is pregnant. She wants an abortion, but her boyfriend, Peter, objects to this. This subplot ties in to the obscene calls and keeps you guessing to the very end.  The highlight is the Italian-style, dark and gloomy atmosphere and tone that Bob Clark has established. This amps up the spook factor and makes up for the lack of gore. This movie certainly paved the way for ""Halloween"" and ""Scream"" among   many other horror films. Theres also a nice mix of humor, largely due to Margot Kidder and the dopey police sergeant, the same one from Porky's. Black Christmas combines many of the right elements in a good Horror movie with good scares, chilling music, and humor. If theres any downfall it would be that it is quite dated and this shows during a pivotal point in the movie where the Police put a tap on the obscene calls, but are only able to get a read by having Hussey's character keep the caller on the line for an extended length of time, but this does help build the drama and horror, however.  Theres also a lot of profanity, for 1974, very strong language, but this adds to the realism of life in college sorrority.  Highly Recommended for any horror film buff.",Black Christmas

Let me start by saying my favorite types of movies are Horror and Christmas movies. So I understand my opinion might be a bit biased. If you are a pure new age horror fan this movie won't be for you. The gore is extremely minimal and the use of jump scares are non existent. Instead this film haunts your core with it's realism. The idea that a crazy man has snuck his way into your attic and is stalking the women living there is intense alone. What makes that scenario even more frightening is there is no mention of a reason for this man to do this to these innocent college girls. The score is a top 5 of mine in cinema history. A great mix of horror and classic Christmas songs. The actors on top of it are amazing or a slasher film. You build a strong connection with the characters thanks to the amazing writing.

The acting was as putrid as the direction of the film. The only redeeming part of the movie was John Saxon and that's solely due to him being in Nightmare on Elm St. People give the remake a hard time, but it's much more entertaining than this dumpster fire of a movie.

345,Kenzi_the_Succubus,Is there anything creepier?,10,5 January 2013,"This little Canadian film has to be my favorite slasher film. While Michael Meyers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface & Chucky have all become horror icons the killer in this has not. Its understandable. You never actually even see the killer which makes it all the more creepy and makes anything he does unexpected.The acting in this film is very solid. Olivia Hussey does a good performance as the ""head of the sorority girls"" as does Margot Kidder. The height of acting has to go to the voice of the killer. He is probably the creepiest horror antagonist ever. The way he uses 6 or 7 different voices while talking to them and the fact that when you first hear him, he's talking about raping them. There is nothing creepier to me than that.Anyway, the plot is that a sorority house has these disturbing calls from this ""psycho"" and they ask to put a trace on where the calls are coming from, but not before a few girls turn up missing.The part that really got me on the edge of my seat was when they completed the trace and you realized ""hey, the calls are sent to this address but they're also coming from it too"", something that other horror directors would shamelessly use as a cliché in future horror movies such as ""When A Stranger Calls"".Overall this has to be the creepiest movie I have ever seen (and I am more or less a ""horror junkie"") and I highly recommend this to fans of films such as ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"", ""Halloween"" & ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".",Black Christmas

The way you didn't know what this man was doing or why. Just made it ten times creepier. From beginning to finish I was amazed. It starts off on Christmas Eve, you go into a first-Person view of the Killer as he approaches the house. He then begins to climb in. Just the way his hands are climbing up the fence was chilling. The film is a Masterpiece. Unfortunately for Bob's other work. Yeah not so Well. (Porky's, Baby Geniuses 1 & 2 and so Forth.) The Phone calls at which are made throughout the film get creepier and Creepier as the film progresses. The kills are solid and this is one I could watch every year.

I made it through to the first obscene phone call before my Mom chases me out of the room! Up until that point, what I remember scaring me the most was the mood that was already established; my imagination was already filling in the blanks! I don't think it was until recently that I saw the film in it's entirety and other than some rather silly plot holes, the strength of the movie is what it ""suggests"" rather than delivers! A lot of the violence is inferred in lieu of the gore that has become the industry standard in today's slasher fare. Bob Clark's direction in this movie has become so copied, it was only until recently that I realized he almost single handedly defined the genre of slasher film; The point of view camera angles of the killer, the slow hand held camera shots going around dark corners or behind doors...Clark apparently gave John Carpenter the idea for 'Halloween' which in turn is such an homage of sorts to this movie! It's a true one of a kind classic and real creepfest you'll find yourself trying to avoid...until you need to watch it again!",Black Christmas

There is no active action for a spectator. I can not even replace myself anyone of the characters. The way its shooting is not effective at all. No thrill, no mystery. At least, through the ending, the tempo and the rhythm of the movie should be accelerated. There are a lof things going on in the movie but the conscious selection of the speed blocking the events. I don't know, there is a huge problem with this movie and, in my opinion, it is because the tempo, the rhytm and the speed that choosen by the maker. Purely boring slasher.",Black Christmas

351,Anton-20,The first and best slasher flick.,10,2 July 1999,"You may argue that Psycho was the first and best slasher flick, but you'd be wrong.  Psycho's events took place in an isolated area, and so it is disqualified from the slasher genre, however, Black Christmas was the first film to bring terror to suburbia. Girls in a sorority house (including Romeo and Juliet's Olivia Hussey and Superman's Margot Kidder) are victimised by a prank caller, and then those within their number start to go missing. Definitely the scariest parts of the film are the parts where the police make Olivia Hussey listen to the demented ramblings of the phantom caller. Although John Carpenter's Halloween was acclaimed as the first slasher pic, this film was made four years before Halloween, and contains many of the elements that seem so 'original' in Halloween (such as the killer's first person perspective, and its almost omniscient characteristics). It is a crying shame that this movie never got the success (nor the critical acclaim) that is so well deserves.  It certainly ought to go down in history as the definitive stalk 'n' slash.",Black Christmas

Don't know why but boy was I in for a surprise. I don't know how many thousands of horror films I have seen...but one thing is for sure and that is I am not easily impressed these days but Black Christmas did the job! Yes, we've seen the story before; a group of teenagers stalked by a crazed killer but have this in mind; Black Christmas came BEFORE all Halloweens, Friday The 13th's and Screams and therefore is somewhat of a groundbreaking movie in that sense even though it wasn't first with the hack-and-slash body count formula (check out Mario Bava's Twitch of the Death Nerve from 1971. THAT was early!) Anyway; Black Christmas is a near flawless treat of pure terror with some genuinely creepy and scary scenes including the phone calls from the psycho to his soon-to-be victims. That voice of his...and his crazy psychotic screaming on the phone is maybe the most effective sounds in any horror film ever! This gem is not to be missed!",Black Christmas
356,johnson3315,One of the greatest slashers films ever.,10,28 January 2002,"Let me just say that I am a huge horror movie fan.  I thought I had seen just about everything when I heard about this little film from the early 70's.  I will say I went into it with big expectations after reading so many positive reviews from the internet, and I wasn't disappointed.I won't dive into a description of the plot, you just need to see it if you haven't already.  I will say that this film is not only a great film, but one that possesses many of the slasher standards that are so predominant in those movies today, and it pre-dates almost all of them.  While I won't say this film is the first horror movie to the killer P.O.V. shot, it is, along with Dario Argento's ""Deep Red"" (made the same year), one of the first to do it very, very effectively.  And you'll see where countless others like, ""When A Stranger Calls"" and ""House on Sorroity Row"" lift many ideas, just to name a few.The director, Bob Clark, who is better known for his comedies of the 80's (Porky's, A Christmas Story) more than his horror movies of the 70's, is excellent in creating very human characters, a creepy atmosphere, and a very good story line, without generating terrible dialogue.  And let's not forget the very scary killer.  If you can find it on Ebay, I recommend one of his first horror films, ""Deathdream"" (a.k.a. ""The Night Andy Came Home""). Very rare and very small budget, it is another example of why I wish Clark would have directed other horror films throughout his career.  Also look for collaborations with writer/director Alan Ormsby on ""Deranged"" (1974) and ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things"" (1972).See this movie.  It is available on DVD.  And thankfully, ""Black Christmas 2"" is finally in production.   Grade A",Black Christmas

I keep reading ""best horror movie of all time, and scared the hell out of me"". While this movie had it's moments, most of them humorous ones, it will never be on my Top 10 list of scary movies. I'm sure that when Black Christmas first came out it was terrifying, but there are much scarier horror films out there now. The scariest moment in this fairly slow movie was the creepy eye of the killer peering out from the crack of the door. I'll admit that gave me the willies! The gore factor was at zero, and there where some great chances for some good body part shots! The ""creepy"" psycho voice on the phone only made me giggle like a sorority girl.

This movie instantly came to mind. It was the only movie I could think of.

360,dant-allen,Overrated,6,23 December 2006,"First off, Black Christmas is not in my mind a ""great horror classic"", as some other people have said. Why? Because it's all violence and a non-exsistent story.The story (warning, spoilers): The film opens at night with a small party occurring in a sorority house for a private school. We are introduced to all of the girls in the sorority house, the main ones being Jess, the heroine of the film, Barb, a drunken loud mouth, and Phyllis, Jess' friend and the peace keeper of the group. The girls have been receiving mysterious phonecalls from someone they call ""The Moaner"". The calls start out sexual in nature, but they gradually grow more macabre, with the man on the other end saying strange things in different voices. The shyest sorority girl, Claire, goes upstairs to pack, and when she goes into the closet, the killer dives out and wraps a plastic bag around her head. He then drags her into the attic, and puts her in a rocking chair. The next day, Claire's father comes to pick her up, but nobody knows where she is. It becomes a mystery as the police search for the missing Claire. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mac, the house mother, stumbles upon the killer and gets a crane hook in the face. Meanwhile, Jess admits to her boyfriend Peter that she is pregnant, but she's having an abortion. He begins to act strange, and shows off some anger problems. As Barb and Phyl are murdered by the killer, Jess gets another call. The police trace the call and realize that the calls are coming from in the house. Instead of going out, Jess goes upstairs and is attacked by the killer. She manages to escape and heads to the basement. There she runs into Peter, who she now falsely believes is the killer. He approaches her to talk, but Jess hits him over the head and kills him. The police feel the case is closed, and leave the house, leaving Jess alone to sleep off the excitement. As the credits begin to roll, we hear the phone ring once again.Now, this film has major plot spoilers, such as(warning, more spoilers): Police arrive at the home but make no effort to search it, despite two bodies having been undiscovered. (Also noteworthy is that an officer notes ""The local morgue cannot handle this many bodies."") The deranged killer is able to repeat lines of dialogue from other characters on the phone, though it seems almost impossible he could have heard them despite being in the house. Despite the parent of one victim being around for the entire movie, no one suggests searching for his daughter when the mystery appears to be solved and she has not been found. Police leave the final potential victim alone in the house sleeping. (Sploliers end now)Basiclyy, this film is all blood and no story. Even though Halloween, (1978) is a rip-off of it, (in my opinion), it's all far better movie.",Black Christmas

The worst thing was that my parents knew the owners of the house that the movie was filmed in and I had been there many times before and had many enjoyable visits. We had even spent the night there with no problems. I couldn't believe when I saw the film that it was the same house but my mom's friend told me they moved all of their furniture out and completely remodeled the sections that were used in the movie. After filming was completed the film company put the house back to normal, but the house felt different somehow. It's hard to explain but the atmosphere in the house had changed even my mother noticed it. I went back once and never went again. Even though they had never intended to do this the couple sold the house soon after. My mom's friend always blamed the movie for making her move from the house she loved.",Black Christmas

367,GoWFanatic,Indirectly influenced modern slasher movies.,8,14 July 2013,"Black Christmas is a movie to watch not for entertainment, but for its influence on modern horror. Most haven't seen this film when compared to Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street, much less heard of it, aside from the poor 2006 remake. There isn't much about this movie that screams brilliance. Despite a relatively low-budget, it isn't filmed too well, and even though you may care about the protagonists, the acting isn't note-worthy (although John Saxon never hurts); but how the villain is portrayed; through first-person view and his M.O. of making phone calls to his victims; paved a way for modern slasher films. His tactics have been done in previous movies from the 40s through 60s, but was brought together in Black Christmas.John Carpenter, or someone involved with the original Halloween, stated that without Black Christmas, Halloween, a better and more influential horror film, would never have been made. When you watch both films, it's easy to see why; the influence this film had on Halloween is almost immediately recognized.Even without taking influence into account, this is still a film worth watching, but knowing what it did for great horror films that came after it makes it even better. It deserves a lot more recognition than it has.",Black Christmas
368,mikesto-1,Does anyone else feel shortchanged?,5,26 December 2008,"Can't understand some of the tremendous reviews this film garnered. Okay on its plus side its beautifully shot, the score is genuinely chilling and the acting is excellent throughout particularly Olivier Hussey and John Saxon - the film also exudes a sense of menace and it ends without having resolved the plot which I like but can imagine putting off some viewers. But the bad points are very bad. Firstly the ridiculous noises coming from the phone were more humorous than scary with everything but the kitchen sink coming down the line. For scary sounds watch the Exorcist. But the worse thing about this movie for me were the murders where the camera breaks away from the scene as soon as the murderer attacks someone. Indeed some murders (such as that of the bespectacled female) were not shown at all. This is poor in the extreme and as a viewer I feel short changed. Its not that I want to see acts of violence - indeed one of the scariest films was 7 where no violence was actually seen being committed - it was only the aftermath that was shown on screen but it worked beautifully and warranted an adult rating but this film could quiet easily have been given a PG certificate. It was that spineless and certainly wasn't adult entertainment.",Black Christmas

The movie starts and you think, s***. Sorority girls? Lois from Superman? An SCTV girl with an afro? WHY OH WHY DID I RENT THIS? But don't worry, you'll be surprised. This is one of the first true ""slashers"" and it lives up to it's place in that genre. To start the scariness at a minimum, we're introduced to a stranger through creepy creepy phonecalls. We then see through the eyes of some guy with bad asthma climbing the house. He hides in the attic, which in its self is scary! The interesting thing about this movie is that the killings are minimal, and there's no chase scene that I recall, making it unique. There are small problems in it, like while tracing a call from the killer, we see the telephone worker running to manually track the right box by running through hundreds of shelves, and he fails. We see how crazy this killer is, just by how ruthless he is. Then the ending, THE ENDING! That will give you a shudder or two.I know I didn't say much about the plot, but it's basically this: Sorority house, missing girls, creepy boyfriend, suspicious cop, drunken ""house mother"", missing cat too, and one sonofagun creepy killer hiding in the attic!",Black Christmas

I had not seen Black Christmas.Onward...This film is very ominous, realistic and even funny. Black Christmas has a plot that was later used in a lot of slasher films as well: a group of girls living in a sorority house are stalked by a-- well in this case it's hard to define the character of Billy, disturbing and morbid? The comedic parts are just as great as the scary scenes too. Like when Barb (Margot Kidder) is describing to a cop the address of the sorority house as ""Fellatio 20880"". The ending, in my opinion made the movie even better. (Spoiler alert) Jess (Olivia Hussey) kills her boyfriend, thinking he's the killer. The cops arrive and let her rest. As she rests, the camera pans away and moves into the attic, where Billy whispers ""Agnes, it's me Billy."" *shiver* You must see this classic, don't bother for the remake.",Black Christmas

It scares you so badly, but unlike most horror films it stays classy by not showing gore (this film doesn't need it anyway). Whats really cool though is I actually went right to the house where it was filmed at. Believe it or not its located right in downtown Toronto. My uncle was at one point friends with the owners of the house, and went right up in the infamous attic. He said some of the things from the movie had been left behind, such as the horse (Mind you this was over twenty years ago). He also said the the killer would had to have been pretty tanked to climb up the wall (He tried and failed I guess. And he was a Canadian champion boxer!). I think its cool because unlike a lot of film locations you can just go there, that is, if you can find it (It really blends in). If i can get the address, I will share it with you, but please remember that it is someone's home and private property, so don't intrude. Also, on Halloween if you look up in the window you might see a dummy with a clear plastic bag on its head.",Black Christmas

I believe I was either ten or eleven when I first saw it. My parents went to sleep right before it came on and I stayed up to watch it (which they wouldn't have let me in any way if they knew this movie!). This was the movie that put a deep dread AND fascination in me for horror movies and suspense/thrillers. It terrified me beyond words, yet as good horror movies do they take you for a ride that thrills you to your core. Man, I remember the unbelievable dread at the end of the movie and after it was over I remember saying to myself ""That was the most scared I've ever been"".There have been times as an adult that took me back to the horror that this movie implanted in me as a child....One night, sleeping in my apartment alone, I was suddenly awoken by my door opening. I slept in almost complete darkness at the time. I jumped into the ""fight or flight"" mode and the flight took control...I screamed and screamed like a little girl throwing my pillow at the unseen attacker! I was able to turn on the lights and I came to find out that the wind (during the summer with windows open) was responsible for pushing my door open when it wasn't shut all the way. I woke up my neighbors with the screams and commotion I made and they called the cops thinking I was being murdered! LOL Man was I embarrassed! But after it was over I remembered that that fear I felt was so similar to the fear I first felt when I watched Black Christmas all those years before.Another instance when, I was a teen, I remember watching a news broadcast which told of a stranger living in the basement of a family's house for several months before the family found out. I believe the man was insane and would come upstairs in the dead of night to sneak food and use the bathroom. Apparently he would go upstairs while everyone slept and watch them. He didn't hurt them, but MAN! That gave me the same creeps that this movie did. It made me search every square inch of my house, during the day with a shotgun! I guess it just goes to show that a truly good scary movie like this one can really get under your skin! Some folks give this movie a four, three and even two star rating, which amazes me. There really is no film that compares with this one for the creepiness and dread. I think that the younger folks who are more used to the modern horror movies just can't appreciate, I believe, the genius of the suspense, dread and insane-ness of this movie.If you are twenty five and younger, try watching this movie by yourself, alone in the dark of night. You'll then understand that feeling of deep dread and ""creepiness"" that will make you stop the movie, turn on all the lights and re-check the windows and doors and the closets and under the bed...and maybe even the attic if you have the strength to do so!",Black Christmas

The killer, makes prank phones calls to a sorority then kills them off one by one. John Saxon is in there as a cop for some reason but the cops don't seem to exist for any other reason than to pad out the more than ample run time. The end is the slasher genre equivalent to ""it was all just a dream"". Basically, YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS DOING THE KILLING AND WHY! WTF!? HOW UNSATISFYING CAN YOU GET? Most, at least the entertaining, slasher films have a twist, or a reason, an impetus for the killer's motivations, that's 90% of the story, and why you want to watch. the production values were pretty decent, and the actors all did their parts decently, but with no central thread holding what they're trying to pass off as a story this is a big pass, and only for those who are horror film buff completeists.

To think that Bob Clark, the director of Baby Geniuses, could compose such a terrifying thriller is astounding. It's sad that everyone gives Halloween the credit as the best slasher film, but this film really is the best, and everyone says that Halloween is genius because of its P.O.V shots, but this film beat by about four years by doing some creepy P.O.V shots and editing.

I've only seen this movie once and always hope to see it playing somewhere, a must see.

Anyone like this ending better? The director didn't. There is something very creepy about the killer still being there, identity unknown, in the film's ending. It's a shame a re-make is coming. Could this plot actually work in today's high tech atmosphere? Can Hollywood find an original idea? Obviously, NO. So sad. This is what's funny... The 1974 version pre-dates another movie with a similar theme called WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, which of course has it's own teen ready re-make coming out soon. When the new BLACK Christmas comes out people will say they ripped off STRANGER, never realizing that both were 70's films, with Christmas coming 3 years first. I hate that ""tweens"" get to dictate horror films. It's abysmal. Good googily moogily though, Olivia Hussey was one beautiful woman.",Black Christmas
