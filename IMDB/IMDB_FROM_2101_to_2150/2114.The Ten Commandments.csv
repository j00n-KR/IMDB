0,MartinHafer,One of the most overrated bad films in movie history,3,12 December 2020,"For some reason which I do not at all understand, IMDB deleted my previous review for this film. Someone obviously felt offended that I didn't like the movie, so I'll try to say it perhaps a bit nicer this time.""The Ten Commandments"" is a lovely idea for a film. And, I do respect the spectacle that is this movie. But like so many Cecil B. De Mille productions, it suffers from an over-emphasis on spectacle and an under-emphasis on writing and dialog. So, for every amazing scene you are given in the movie, you are forced to watch some really unintentionally hilarious bad acting/writing. My wife and I find ourselves laughing and saying many of the lines...they are that poor. For example, the princess bellowing out ""Moses....MOOOOSSSEEESS!"" and Edward G. Robinon's character apparently being based on his character from ""Little Caesar"" and constantly repeating how Moses led them into the desert to die!If you love this film....great. But for me, it's a great example of a ton of money being spent and the writing and dialog simply is bad.",The Ten Commandments
1,TheLittleSongbird,Magnificent,10,27 January 2011,"This is one magnificent film. Brilliantly directed by Cecil B DeMille, it boasts some splendid cinematography and gorgeous scenery and attention to detail. Not only that, but also a script that positively sparkles, characters that are refreshingly complex, a rousing score courtesy of the great Elmer Bernstein and a compelling story. Also impressive, perhaps even more so, are the astonishing set pieces and the acting. In the lead Charlton Heston is very powerful while Yul Brynner too gives one of his best performances. The supporting cast are equally impressive, Cedric Hardwicke, Vincent Price, Judith Anderson, John Carradine, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne DeCarlo and Debra Paget are all memorable. All in all, The Ten Commandments is nothing short of the epitome of magnificence not just in its scope but also its complexity. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The Ten Commandments
2,bkoganbing,"""Moses, Take What Spoils You Will From Egypt And Go""",8,17 February 2006,"When I was 10 years old I saw The Ten Commandments in the the theater which is the only place it really should be seen. At the time I thought it was the greatest film ever. All that splashy color cinematogaphy and eye filling spectacle. The guy that put this together is some kind of special genius. Then I grew up.Today in a lot of quarters this and other DeMille sound films are viewed as pretty high camp. Especially those that touch on a religious theme. It's that dialog and The Ten Commandments longer than any other of his films has more of it. People talking some of that high falutin' nonsense, together with a good mixture of sex.What a lot of people fail to remember is that before Cecil B. DeMille came to Hollywood he was an actor and playwright on Broadway. He learned his trade at the feet of David Belasco, the premier Broadway producer/playwright of his day. In that Victorian/Edwardian era, ALL the actors, in Belasco plays especially spouted that stuff. I recall Anne Baxter saying that Moses spurned her like a strumpet. How many people do you know who use the word strumpet in their every day conversation? Or Yvonne DeCarlo saying to Charlton Heston that he Moses is God's torch to light the way to freedom and that by the way she loves him? DeMille made one great casting decision in getting the only actor who could play Moses and make it believable. This indeed was Charlton Heston's career role and as he said in his autobiography if you can't make a career out of the lead in two DeMille pictures it ain't happening. One other member of the cast Edward G. Robinson as Dathan loved this picture. Robinson had been dropping in star status since the late Forties and was now doing mostly B films. DeMille, whose rightwing politics Robinson despised, gave him this part and Robinson's career got a big shot in the arm. Robinson was grateful and gave him full credit in his unfinished memoirs. Most of the last half of The Ten Commandments is a running verbal battle between Heston and Robinson who is trying to keep some kind of control. Robinson is almost like the leader of a company union with the Hebrew slaves as members and Robinson sure enjoys the perks of office.The first half of the film is the sex part, hovering over all the biblical jargon. DeMille used an old gambit of his, two men in a rivalry over a woman. It worked in previous films like Northwest Mounted Police, Reap the Wild Wind, Unconquered and now here. Anne Baxter is a royal princess promised to the next Pharoah designate. But who will Sir Cedric Hardwicke designate. Charlton Heston his nephew or Yul Brynner his son? Anne Baxter has Nefretiri has both these guys hormones in overdrive. She favors Moses, but then Moses gets a higher calling.Though he was no director of actors and his sense of drama was generations old, DeMille was a firm believer in two things, fill the screen and make the films move. 50 years later the parting of the Red Sea will still make one gasp. It's not just publicity hype when The Ten Commandments is advertised with a cast of thousands, that is thousands you're seeing on that screen. Elmer Bernstein wrote the musical score for The Ten Commandments one of his first. He credited DeMille with teaching him how to write musical scores for film that underscore movement. This score brought him his first real notice as a film composer and he certainly became one of the best.Given the computer technology available today, one can only imagine what Cecil B. DeMille could create today. Of course he'd insist on some of the same writing, but then again without it, it wouldn't be a DeMille picture.",The Ten Commandments
3,Leofwine_draca,Hollywood's top Biblical epic,8,5 January 2020,"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is a film that I'd never watched previously but which quickly went to the top of my list of favourite Biblical films on viewing. Undoubtedly this is a crowning masterpiece from director Cecil B. DeMille, an all-star epic that plays out over a near four hours yet remains awe-inspiring and engrossing throughout. What I loved most here were the visuals; the colour is glorious and the huge sets and colourful costumes look wonderful on screen. You can even forgive the dated back projection as the vistas displayed are so wonderful. The story of Moses will be familiar to many viewers, but it's told here with spectacle and aplomb, enlivened by top performances from Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner and a quite wonderful supporting cast (including a surprise appearance from a personal favourite, Vincent Price).",The Ten Commandments
4,SnoopyStyle,Old Hollywood extravaganza,8,19 April 2014,"Based on the biblical story of Moses, Cecil B. DeMille has created one of the great Hollywood extravaganzas. The story starts with the people of Israel suffering under slavery in Egypt. The Pharoah orders all Jewish newborns to be killed after a sign in the stars predicting the birth of the leader who will lead his people out of slavery. Widowed princess Bithiah finds the baby floating down the Nile as a gift from the god. The baby would grow up to be Prince Moses (Charlton Heston) while he competes with Prince Rameses (Yul Brynner) for the favor of the Pharoah. From there to when the Jews are finally set free to finally end their wondering in the desert, this is an old fashion Hollywood big budget drama.It's obvious that the production is huge. The scale of the sets are grand. The effects are great for its times especially the parting of the Red Sea. Charlton Heston plays the moral hero to the fullest. It's old fashion and there is no subtlety. Yul Brynner plays the jealous Rameses brilliantly. Edward G. Robinson is simply the best as the corrupting Dathan. For being an iconic movie and such a well made movie, it deserves its place in movie history.",The Ten Commandments
5,Hitchcoc,Thou Shalt Not Bore,7,19 April 2006,"I first saw this film when I was nine years old. It did go on. I remember being amazed by the special effects. More impressive than the parting of the Red Sea were some of the plagues. That burning bush was pretty hokey, but, hey, it was the fifties. It doesn't wear so well these days. There are a lot of rough edges everywhere. But it was a masterpiece of its time. What I find the hardest these days s the pacing. It seems to go on forever. There are long pompous speeches, lots of overacting, and some plot elements that are thrown in for,what were then modern audiences. Edward G. Robinson seems to have a lot of clout. If someone had just parted the sea and performed a whole series of miracles, would you immediately betray him and follow a guy who has done nothing but talk. But then the masses may be asses. What have you done for me lately. Had this film been made today, it could be put into the hands of a top film editor and made much tighter and more intense. I thought Yul Brynner's presence was really good. He's the best thing in the movie. I really tire of the female characters and his wife is, in my estimation, pretty insufferable. Charlton Heston was pretty good as a young actor, long before he became a caricature. The biggest sin for this film is that they talk the life right out of it. I'm glad when they get where they're going so they don't have to discuss it anymore.",The Ten Commandments
6,mark.waltz,"There's no topping this biblical camp epic for excellence in acting, pacing and technical achievement.",10,23 July 2013,"There are so many highlights in this sometimes campy spectacle, and the best place to begin is with its out-of-the-ordinary introduction by director Cecil B. DeMille who could star in a McDonald's commercial and still be unintentionally funny. But once the breathtaking Elmer Bernstein score opens the credits and the story rolls, you are hooked. Then, the story of Moses unfolds, telling how when the Pharaoh ordered the death of all newborns (as King Herod did at the time of the birth of Jesus), and mother Yochabel (Martha Scott) sends her daughter with the baby to make sure the child is adopted, and when it ends up in the Pharaoh's home as raised by his own daughter (Nina Foch), it is a sense of Godly irony. The only other person to know the truth is the slave Memnet (Judith Anderson), an embittered Egyptian who wants no Hebrew to be Pharaoh.Years later, the grown Moses (Charlton Heston) is at friendly rivalry with his cousin Ramases (Yul Brynnur) for the hand of the Princess Neferitiri (a very campy Anne Baxter) and circumstances arise which reveal the truth of his real identity. A silly subplot surrounds slave master Vincent Price who covets the Hebrew Debra Paget and his traitorous Hebrew overseer (extremely campy Edward G. Robinson) seeks ambitiously to gain power through his sudden knowledge in regards to Prince Moses. Sent out into the desert, Moses meets his future wife (a somewhat non-campy Yvonne DeCarlo, usually cast in the type of role that Baxter plays) and his destiny for leading the Hebrew slaves out of Egypt is set.So ends Act One, and there is much more camp, much more spectacle to follow, and it is all riveting, perfect in every way. This is one of those films where you ask why every Egyptian or Roman ruler had a British accent (in this case Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Pharaoh Seti) and after Hardwicke expresses his displeasure to an adviser with his constant retort ""You Old Windbag"", you know you're not in Biblical Egypt anymore but the delightfully warped mind of the outrageous Cecil B. DeMille.Everything in this film works, from the showing of how the Hebrews help build the Egyptian Pyramids to the parting of the Red Sea, and finally to the Lord's revenge at Mount Sinai. Every actor, even those in minor roles, has something to do and some truly campy lines. Acting honors are split between Heston and Brynnur (who would win the Oscar the same year for ""The King and I""), with particularly fine work by Anderson (demoted from Hebrew queen in ""Salome"" to slave here), Scott and John Carradine as Moses' brother Aaron, a role he plays like a Biblical John Brown. I must note that Anderson's costuming was almost repeated exactly when she played the Nurse in the 1981 Broadway revival of ""Medea"". Scott is particularly touching as she recognizes her son in a scene after he saves her from being crushed by a moving pyramid boulder when her outfit gets caught on it. Even with their over-the-top performances, you can't help but adore Baxter and Robinson, and in spite of the blandness of her role, DeCarlo is thoroughly lovely. The weak points are Paget and John Derek as Joshua who seems way too enthusiastic and sometimes appears to be extremely eager to take over Moses' calling.If you can, catch this one on the big screen, even if you have seen it a thousand times at Easter on television. The editing they do on TV is disastrous to the film's overall impact, especially with the excessive commercials which interrupt it. Try hard not to watch it as a comedy (I know that is very difficult considering how many people can quote this film beyond just reciting the actual ten commandments) and you will find something profound, but if you do find yourself laughing, you will not be the only one.",The Ten Commandments
7,classicsoncall,"""God will give him a name.""",10,1 June 2018,"Like a handful of reviewers here, I first encountered ""The Ten Commandments"" in the theater on a parochial school class trip to the movies. As a Catholic, we had already been instructed on the life of Moses and how he rose to prominence to lead the Hebrews out of Egypt and slavery. As a kid, I would have been eight or nine years old at the time, and was looking forward to seeing how the baby Moses was found floating in the river, and how the adult Moses turned his staff into a snake. It goes without saying that the burning bush scene and parting of the Red Sea had to be in the picture as well. I recall some disappointment that there were no plagues of frogs or locusts on screen, but after all, the film ran over three and a half hours as it is.Watching the movie the other night brought back a lot of those reminiscences, and I was pretty amazed at how colorful and full of pageantry the picture was. The cast of thousands was indeed a cast of thousands, epic in scope of course, and one of those reminders that 'they just don't make 'em like that any more'. But with an adult eye, some of the film's glaring downsides are more than noticeable. Like the stilted dialog that hearkens all the way back to the birth of talkie films, and the wooden performances of characters portrayed by the likes of John Derek (Joshua), Vincent Price (Baka) and John Carradine (Aaron). I also had to laugh during that scene when Sephora (Yvonne De Carlo) and her sisters met Moses (Charlton Heston) for the first time. The goo-goo eyes directed at Heston were embarrassingly anachronistic even for the 1950's; why director Cecil B. DeMille allowed that to stand I'll never know.But the story pretty much kept faith with the Biblical version of Moses, and gives a good accounting of his break with the Pharaoh and the wandering in the desert on the way to Sinai. Upon studying the opening credits, I had my eyes open for appearances of unlikely actors like Mike (Touch) Connors and Clint Walker but they apparently weren't sharp enough. It's my understanding that Walker got his 'Cheyenne' gig on the basis of his appearance in this film. It was easy to catch Woodrow 'Woody' Strode though as the Ethiopian King bearing gifts for Rameses I (Cedric Hardwicke). And what can you say about Edward G. Robinson? On paper, his casting in a Biblical epic seems rather mindless, but by the time Moses' followers languished in the desert, he really hit stride trying to undermine the whole enterprise. And for cinema fans, the coup de grace of course is the parting of The Red Sea in all it's pre-CGI glory. I read about how DeMille did it once, using combined footage of the Red Sea with scenes from the Paramount backlot using a huge water tank split by a U-shaped trough. It was the most difficult special effect ever to be attempted at that time, and to it's credit, is still impressive to watch today. It's got 'how did they do that' written all over it.",The Ten Commandments
8,gavin6942,The Great Biblical Epic,7,7 May 2015,"The Egyptian Prince, Moses (Charlton Heston), learns of his true heritage as a Hebrew and his divine mission as the deliverer of his people.Is this the greatest Biblical epic of all time? Probably. Although there are other noteworthy films, few have the sweeping range of this film, and few (if any) had the advantage of being shown on television every Easter. (Exactly what Moses has to do with Easter is open to interpretation.) Although I am typically a genre film person, particularly horror, there was plenty to like here. We have Vincent Price, Edward G. Robinson and many more great actors. Price and Robinson on screen together? Wow! Throw in Yul Brynner, and you have one heck of a setup. There must have been a lot of fun after filming finished each day.",The Ten Commandments
9,lee_eisenberg,NRA president meets king of Siam meets Little Caesar meets Lily Munster meets Dr. Phibes,5,11 January 2010,"First, I should say that my favorite Bible-themed movie is Monty Python's ""Life of Brian"". So, I watched ""The Ten Commandments"" mainly so that I could heckle it like on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". For example, when Moses and Nefretiri are getting slinky, I blurted out ""Is that a sphinx in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"". Like any biblical epic, it sets itself up to get mocked.Aside from the obvious soap opera qualities inherent in Cecil B. DeMille's epic, it's still one that I recommend. It appears that the movie was a slight allusion to the Cold War, with the stuff about men not having to live under tyranny. The orgy actually looks as if it would have been pretty fun. I remember that in ""To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"", the drag queen characters show a girl ""TTC"" to inspire her to dress like Anne Baxter. Part of the reason that the movie's hard to take seriously is the giant cast, including the NRA president, the guy from gangster flicks, Lily Munster and a horror star.I've always thought that it would be neat to cast Harrison Ford as Moses. He could split the Red Sea with a light saber, and then after getting the commandments, escape a series of traps like Indiana Jones.All in all, this movie is definitely worth seeing.",The Ten Commandments
10,jboothmillard,The Ten Commandments,9,31 May 2010,"I had seen it listed in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I heard some things about the making of the film, and I knew how long it was, so it was just a case of trying it, from director Cecil B. DeMille (The Greatest Show on Earth). Basically it is all about the life of Moses, starting from when he was a baby sent down the river Nile when the Pharoah Rameses declared all first-born Hebrew boys would be killed. He was found by the Pharoah's sister Bithiah (Nina Foch) who raises him to adulthood as the Prince of Egypt. Moses (Golden Globe nominated Charlton Heston) is all grown up and has completely fit into the royal family that rule over Egypt, with the favour of Sethi (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) and a love with Princess Nefretiri (Anne Baxter). Then he discovers his true heritage as a Hebrew, and Sethi's son Rameses (Yul Brynner) wastes no time making sure that he is cast out of the kingdom and anything baring his name removed. After finding civilisation after being stranded in the desert, Moses finds a village, marries and has a son, but the most important event comes when he travels into the strange mountains when he sees a burning bush. This bush speaks, it is the voice of God (Heston's voice), and he commands Moses to free all the Hebrew slaves of Egypt from the wrath of Rameses. Moses returns with a white beard, and he does go to Rameses warning him of the consequences if he does not free the slaves, but the nasty Pharoah does not give into the demands of God. Even with a staff turning into a snake, rivers running with blood, hot hail and three days of darkness, Rameses still does not free the slaves, he even orders all first-born Hebrews are killed, but this backfires. So Moses sends a green cloud that will kill all the firstborns of Egypt, including Rameses's so, and his grief finally convinces him to free all the slaves and follow Moses to the holy place. Rameses does try to catch Moses and all the slaves as they travel, but Moses performs his biggest miracle by parting the sea for all the slaves to walk across the ocean floor, and drown all the soldiers behind them. The final scene of the film sees Moses return from the mysterious mountain, after seeing God fire lightning bolts into the stone wall, carving the ten commandments that everyone will follow. Unfortunately, Moses returns to see everyone committing most of the sins that go against the commandments, and he knows they will forever live in sin, and smashes the two commandment tablet stones, saying a final goodbye to head to Israel. Also starring Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, Debra Paget as Lilia, John Derek as Joshua, John Carradine as Aaron and Vincent Price as Baka. Heston is a great majestic choice to play Moses, he does well without the beard, but with is much more significant, Bryner is terrific as the vile villain, and the supporting cast add to the piece too. The special effects aren't to dated to be enjoyed, the film may be nearly four hours long and contain some near too-far material concerning religion, but as a remake to DeMille's own 1923 classic, this is a magnificent biblical epic. It won the Oscar for Best Special Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture. Moses was number 43 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 79 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, and it was number 21 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!",The Ten Commandments
11,ccthemovieman-1,11th Commandment: Thou Needeth A Remake!,5,3 June 2007,"This was a remake of the 1923 silent film, and was a big hit. It continues to be a popular film on TV, especially at Easter. However, now that it has been 51 years since this last one, it's about time for another updated version! Come on, Hollywood!Because the story of the plagues and the parting the Red Sea is so crucial to the dramatics of this famous Old Testament story, this film is crying out for updated special-effects. The FX in this 1956 movie are almost laughable, they look so primitive compared what is done today.Filmmakers could really make an awesome-looking story with today's technology but, alas, the ultra-secular mindset of Hollywood in the past 50 years doesn't make it look like it will happen. It will take a wealthy individual, not tied to a Hollywood studio, to finance a remake of this movie.That's not to say this film isn't without merit, even today. Of course it is, and with the likes of Charleton Heston, Yul Brynner, Edward G. Robinson, Anne Baxter and Yvonne DeCarlo , you have a nice cast. Who can deny Heston isn't memorable as ""Moses?"" I thought Brynner as ""Rameses,"" the pharaoh of Egypt, was just as intense. There also is such a grand scale to this that, even with outdated effects, it can still awe and inspire. Hey, it's a Cecille B. DeMille directed film, so you know it will epic in the true sense of the word.However, at three-and-a-half hours, and Moses not returning to Egypt after almost two hours of mostly-boring (and Scriptually inaccurate) ramblings, this film lags in too many spots. It isn't just the special-effects that need upgrading, it needs a tighter script, too.",The Ten Commandments
12,moonspinner55,Certainly a classic of some kind...,7,4 April 2008,"Proving that Steven Spielberg did not create The Hollywood Blockbuster, filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille constructs a biblical soap opera here with masterly aplomb, complete with awe-inspiring effects years ahead of their time. This celebrated remake of DeMille's own 1923 silent epic stars Charlton Heston (and his jaw of granite) as Moses. Heston doesn't act, exactly, nor does he imitate anybody else; the star plants his feet firmly in the dirt and reads his lines with stoic professionalism (with the earnestness of someone who innately believes he really is heroic). Heston could pull this role off in a community theater and get raves. It's a celebrity-spotting religious opus which has Moses leading his people out of Egypt, and the ham-handed script and florid trimmings have thrilled and amused a lot of people over the years. The film is still shown yearly on network television, and the colors and pageantry almost make up for the complete lack of spontaneity or wit. *** from ****",The Ten Commandments
13,blanche-2,"Oh Moses, Moses, you stubborn, splendid, adorable fool!",8,8 July 2007,"Even with lines like that, the Cecil B. Demille's ""The Ten Commandments"" still manages to be impressive in its scope and thrill audiences, making it an Eastertime favorite.This was Demille's last film, certainly an ambitious undertaking that tells the story of Moses and how he led his people out of Egypt. Heston told a funny story of booming out the line, LET MY PEOPLE GO and Demille following it up with ""Okay, lunch."" The film has some unintentionally funny scenes, and some moments that are astounding, touching and exciting. The cast is very impressive, with Heston making a strong and virile Moses, Cedric Hardwicke a marvelous Sethi, Yul Brynner a powerful Rameses, John Derek an effective and very hunky Joshua and Debra Paget a lovely Lilia. Yvonne DeCarlo was never more beautiful than when she portrayed Sephora - and the list of names in the cast goes on and on - Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson, Vincent Price, John Carradine, Nina Foch, Martha Scott, Olive Deering, Judith Anderson, Henry Wilcoxin, Eduard Franz - etc.! The special effects are special indeed - this is 1956 and there were no computers to help create the burning bush, write the ten commandments, part the red sea, or drown the pursuers of the Jews as they left Egypt. Some of the effects are more successful than others, the burning bush being the most cartoon-like. That's a small criticism. When Moses parts that Red Sea, no matter how many times you've seen it, it's still thrilling.Possibly the most touching moment is the old man who dies in Moses' arms, lamenting that he did not live to see his Redeemer - but the audience knows that his wish did come true. And I admit to getting chills when I hear, ""So let it be written. So let it be done."" All of that is the up side. Now for the down. Some of the dialogue is strictly modern, especially among Sephora and her sisters and the girls giggling by the pool - pure Hollywood - giving rise to the film's reputation as ""camp."" Anne Baxter's Nefertiti is problematic but then, so are some of her lines, like the above ""Oh, Moses, Moses etc."" For a good actress, she's not really very convincing. Edward G. Robinson's Dathan is a little problematic as he says in his Little Ceasar voice, ""Eh, what about your God now, Moses?"" but he is appropriately slimy. But this is all part of the ""The Ten Commandments,"" and no fan of the film would do without any of it, including the majestic music by Elmer Bernstein.It's impossible to describe the effect of Moses parting the Red Sea and the flight from Egypt - definitely the highlight of the film - and there's a definite lesson about trusting and having faith.You can be wowed by this film, you can love it, you can be entertained by it, you can laugh at it - but ""The Ten Commandments"" will elicit a strong reaction from you, and hopefully an appreciation of its great spectacle.So let it be written. So let it be done",The Ten Commandments
14,Quinoa1984,memories of red seas and crazy Golden parties,7,11 November 2014,"I have not seen The Ten Commandments, in full, since I was a kid. And yet it's a testament to DeMille's skills as a filmmaker in crafting this massive, elephantine testament to the... Old Testament that this can stick in someone's mind so strongly. I've seen bits and pieces over the years and it's questionable whether all the visual effects hold up - or some of the very BIG moments in Heston and Brynner's performances. But it's hard to take out of the mind those moments of the plague, when the water turns to a red that you could only see in movies where the technicolor was done just as it was then, with those processes and treatments. Also the scene where (I'm not spoiling this, it's the Torah/Bible people) Ramses' son is killed, that really stuck out to me as a kid. Something about that, the way it just... happens in the room and the characters have to deal with it, and Moses keeps going on about how horrible it is and it must stop. That can mess with a kid's head.In a way the spectacle of it, how BIG the whole darn thing is, sticks with you the most - and naturally, it's a big spectacle, one of the largest in a career of big ones for DeMille and this was the one he left his career on. But that entire sequence following the Jews escaping from the Egyptians after going through the parting of the seas... as they party and revel and go into total debauchery before the Golden Calf, that's really powerful. In a way that's much more striking and meaningful than some of the special effects of large performances or, yes, stilted dialog. It's seeing how people can act when all boundaries are put aside that makes such an impression really. And then of course the commandments appear and by then the movie is over.But if only for about, oh, twenty or thirty minutes of this four-hour Sperm Whale of a movie truly great filmmaking, bravado and bravura and balls for the period of 1956, are on display. The rest of it is okay too.",The Ten Commandments
15,edwagreen,I Command You to See this Great Film! ****,10,11 December 2005,"What was the Academy of Motion Pictures thinking in 1956? Outrageous that 10 Commandments lost to Around the World in 80 Days.The entire cast should have been nominated for Oscars. Here is how I see it: Best Actor: Charlton Heston and Yul BrynnerBest Actress: Anne BaxterBest supporting actor: Edward G. Robinson,Cedric Hardwicke John Derek, Vincent Price. Best Supporting Actress: Nina Foch, Martha Scott, Judith Anderson, Debra Paget.Shockingly, no one in the stellar cast received acting nominations. Only the lord knows why.Yes, as my rabbi pointed out many years ago, the alleged romance between the Egyptian queen and Moses was overplayed. However, it can't take away from the magnificent acting and quality of this totally absorbing movie.They just don't make movies as great as this one anymore. They'd never have actors and actresses to replace the above great people.In 1956, Brynner did win the best actor Oscar for The King and I. He was far better here. Though, the award should have gone to Kirk Douglas for Lust for Life. Douglas losing, Ten Commandments losing, any message to be learned here? As for the film itself, it should serve as a pre-requisite for those in the industry who wish to make biblical epics. The sets were absolutely lavishing. I guess that opulent would be the best word to describe them. Who can ever forget the dialogue? Remember those princely plots. What alliteration! They just don't open the Red Sea like that anymore.",The Ten Commandments
16,sunwarrior13,The Ten Commandments Is A Must See Epic,10,24 September 2012,"The Ten Commandments is an epic film that is based on the biblical story of the Exodus, in which the Hebrew-born Moses, an adopted Egyptian prince, becomes the deliverer of the Hebrew slaves. It starred Charlton Heston in the lead role together with Yul Brynner as his adoptive brother, Pharaoh Rameses II, Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, Debra Paget as Lilia, and John Derek as Joshua. The supporting cast includes Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Pharaoh Seti I, Nina Foch as Bithiah, Martha Scott as Yoshebel, Judith Anderson as Memnet, Vincent Price as Baka, and John Carradine as Aaron.It was directed by Cecil B. DeMille,his last film.The story relates the life of Moses, from the time he was discovered in the bull rushes as an infant by the Pharaoh's daughter, to his long, hard struggle to free the Hebrews from their slavery at the hands of the Egyptians. Moses starts out as Pharoah's adopted son and an expert at designing pyramids but when he soon discovers his true Hebrew heritage, he attempts to make life easier for his people. Banished by his jealous half-brother Rameses, he returns fully bearded to Pharoah's court, warning that he's had a message from God and that the Egyptians had better free the Hebrews post-haste if they know what's good for them. Only after the Deadly Plagues have decimated Egypt does Rameses give in. As the Hebrews reach the Red Sea, they discover that Rameses has gone back on his word and plans to have them all killed. But Moses rescues his people with a little Divine legerdemain by parting the Seas. Later, Moses is again confronted by God on Mt. Sinai, who delivers unto him the Ten Commandments. Meanwhile, the Hebrews are forgetting their religion and behaving like libertines.High atop the mountain, Moses witnesses God's creation of the stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments. When he finally climbs down, Moses beholds his people's iniquity and hurls the tablets at the idol in a rage. The idol explodes, and Dathan and his followers are killed. After God forces them to endure forty years' exile in the desert wandering lost, to kill off the rebellious generation, the Hebrews are about to arrive in the land of Canaan. An elderly Moses, who, however, is not allowed to enter the promised land, because he disobeyed the lord at the waters of strife,then appoints Joshua to succeed him as leader, says a final good bye to Sephora, and goes forth to his destiny.DeMille's last film may not be the most subtle and sophisticated entertainment ever concocted, but it tells its story with a clarity and vitality that few Biblical scholars have ever been able to duplicate. With a running time of nearly four hours, it is the most extravagant movie that is full of the absurdities and vulgarities one expects and it isn't boring for a minute.Also,it is the director's biggest, most spectacular epic, excessive and lurid but extravagantly entertaining, this all-star spectacular is a spectacular retelling of the great Bible story in which displays himself as a showman.It is definitely a must see!!!!",The Ten Commandments

18,hitchcockthelegend,"His God ""is"" God!",9,12 April 2020,"The Ten Commandments is at the top end of Hollywood historical epics. It was to be Cecil B. DeMille's last ever directing assignment and he bows out with a gargantuan epic that to this day stands as a testament to his brilliant talent as one of the masters of epic film making.The story cribs from a number of biblical sources, some of which are hokum and not to be taken as a religio lesson, but basically it tells the tale of Moses (Charlton Heston) and how he came to lead the Israelites to their exodus from Egypt - culminating in his delivering of God's own Ten Commandments to the people.No expense is spared, with a top line ensemble cast being joined by over 25,000 extras. The wide-screen special effects work dazzles the eyes, the direction of ginormous crowd sequences impressive, and an ebullient spectacle is never far away in what is a picture running at three hours thirty minutes (add ten for the glory of an intermission).It would have been easy for the cast to get lost amongst such a large scale production, but the principals shine bright and make telling characteristic marks. Heston was born for the Moses role, Yul Brynner absolutely excels as Moses' silky and sulky nemesis - Rameses, Anne Baxter gives Nefretiri a beauteous and villainous twin arc, which in turn is counterpointed by Yvonne De Carlo's sultry yet homely Sephora (wife of Moses).Elsewhere we get Debra Paget filling out a trio of gorgeous lady stars, where as Lilia she does determined and heartfelt oomph as a woman yearning to be freed from male dominance. Edward G. Robinson (Dathan) and Vincent Price (Baka) camp it up and have a good time, while Cedric Hardwicke (Sethi) turns in a heartfelt old Pharaoh and John Derek as Joshua, Moses' underling, does surprisingly well given the enormity of the character trajectory.As the music (Elmer Bernstein) swirls and thunders we are treated to Loyal Griggs' colour photography that pings out the screen and brings to life expert costuming. John Fulton's special effects work won him the Academy Award, and even though a couple look creaky these days, they all still today hold great entertaining spectacle worth. While the sheer gusto of the performances overcomes some less than stellar dialogue.Lavish yet vulgar, hokey yet magnificent, this maty not be the greatest historical epic ever made, but it booms loud and proud and is an utter joy for like minded fans of the genre's output. 9/10",The Ten Commandments
19,Doylenf,Looks magnificent in Hi-Def widescreen on cable TV...,7,7 April 2012,"Obviously sparing no expense, and directing it in good old-fashioned Cecil B. DeMille style, this epic gives Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner the chance to give bigger than life performances--something both of them were equally capable of. Brynner struts his stuff as though he just stepped out of ""The King and I,"" and Heston was obviously born to play the role of Moses in theatrical style.The story moves quickly from one big set piece to another, visually stunning in lavish settings (whether indoor or outdoors), and striking in costumes and use of Technicolor for some extraordinary special effects, considering this was before the time of CGI for crowd scenes and other marvels.Anne Baxter never looked lovelier nor was costumed with such a lavish wardrobe, but she does tend to overplay her part as Queen Nefretiri. However, since the dialog is so ripe one can't really blame her. John Derek, Debra Paget, Vincent Price, John Carradine, Henry Wilcoxon, Nine Foch, Judith Anderson, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo, Martha Scott and Cedric Hardwicke all offer their talents to supporting or cameo roles. Of them, only Edw. G. Robinson looks out of his element in this sort of costume epic and it's probably a good thing that he isn't given too much to do.Has to be regarded as one of Cecil B. DeMille's best productions, all of it looking magnificent in its fully restored splendor. When it's all over, it's Heston and Brynner who make the most memorable impression.Only quibble: Heston's aging for the final scene in what looks like a white department store beard made of cotton had me wincing, especially since the other players looked remarkably unscathed by time.",The Ten Commandments

It is a glorious piece of cinema but no amount of beautiful colour and costumes can detract from what is really rather a staid, over-egged production. Sir Cedric Hardwicke helps open the proceedings as Seti, but once he has gone the film loses much of it's class and just becomes a vehicle for Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner to play Moses and Ramses as this overly scripted tale of frail brotherly love becomes enmity and ultimately open hostility. Edward G.

There are many ways to watch this, from the just taking it on its wooden face, or watching it for the entirely bizarre casting which makes you wonder what was Cecil B De Mille thinking or perhaps one could watch trying to find all of the subtexts - both real and imagined.They don't make them like this any more and once you've witnessed the spectacle of ancient Egypt you'll know why, productions like this are simply too huge to work with out falling into parody.

23,Boba_Fett1138,Even the opening logo is epic.,9,22 September 2010,"This is one big, overblown and overacted epic but I was absolutely taken by it.In todays light and perspective, certain elements of this movie and it's overall approach can be seen definitely as silly and overdone. But you also really have to put this movie in its perspective and realize that this movie was one of the very first within its sort. Movies like ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"", ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts"" weren't made yet and this really was one of the very first Hollywood movies to take a grand, epic and adventurous approach with its story. Movies of this scale were something new and still in development. The movie takes an almost stage-play approach at times. This means foremost that the movie features often silly long dialog, that at times seem to come out of a Shakespeare play. Seriously, just no person ever said sentences that way, not even a couple of thousands of years ago. There is plenty of overacting in this movie, even from the greatest actors that are all in it. But it really didn't bugged me that much, since the overall movie was taking a bit of an overblown approach with basically everything and it did this well and effective, which caused me to be taken away by it all, nonetheless.I was definitely impressed by this movie. Not only by its looks but also really by its compelling story. It's of course a well known story, everybody is already in one way or another familiar with and it's a story with lots of great elements in it. Not that I really cared for any of the movie its religious messages but I can look past all of these elements. Nevertheless I should say that I don't think the movie always took a very good approach with its religious story elements. I don't feel it explains really enough as to why God does certain things, which at times makes 'his' actions seem a bit uncalled for and he is simply asking way to much of Moses and his people to endure. The movie claimed it tried to tell the story of Moses and then especially what happened with him in the period that he was still the prince of Egypt till the moment he came down the mountain, spreading the ten commandments amongst his people. For this it falls back to some scriptures and of course the bible itself but also foremost on some novels, that attempt the tell the true story and history of Moses. It's always a bit dodgy when a movie like this claims it's telling the true story and present things as facts, since it at times certainly takes a lot of liberties with its story and of course because no one on this earth could say what is really true about this story and what isn't.This movie is known for its epicness but also really because of its epic running time, that is around 3 and a half hours long. This is a long sit, for just every movie, no matter how great and compelling it is. And yes, they could had certainly cut some moments short in this movie or completely cut it out entirely but by saying this I by no means am of opinion that the movie has some bad scenes in it. Basically ever scenes is great to look at and really adds something to the story and its characters. But really, no movie ever needs to be that long and it's not like the story can only be told in a 3 hour+ movie. Just look at the ""The Prince of Egypt"" that is more than twice as short but still pretty much tells the same story.Visually this movie is really eye candy. It's a movie that got shot in full color and also really got made for the wide-screen. It uses plenty of early special effects, of which some are still quite looking by todays standards. But this movie impresses the most with its grand looking sets, environments (Egypt never looked more impressive on screen and this movie got hardly shot in Egypt at all actually) and all of its extra's. It uses 14,000 extra's in it, which really shows in some of its crowed sequences.The movie has plenty of big acting names in it. And even though most of the time and most of them are overacting, it's still a pleasure seeing all of those great names together on screen. Some of them are cast in, for them, some unlikely roles, such as Edward G. Robinson who most people were only accustomed to seeing as a gangster and Vincent Price and John Carradine, who both are best known for their work in the horror genre. But most of the actors also weren't really established names yet at the time. Just look at Yul Brynner, who had only just a few movies behind his name, prior to this one. But before this review is starting to take epic proportions, let me just end it by saying that this is one wonderful to look at overblown epic movie, that I was taken away by.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Ten Commandments
24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Epic,7,8 June 2008,"Regardless of one's belief system, it is a near-impossible feat to argue with the sheer height of the production value. Costumes, sets, props, it's all incredibly well-done. The credibility and detail in it is top-notch. The scope of this is amazing. The material shot on location matches the rest so smoothly it is an accomplishment to determine where one ends and the other begins, without being informed by someone who is certain. I'm hardly the person who knows most about the tale told here, which does not mean I am the individual with the least knowledge of it either, but I would say, they depict a large portion, rather close to the entirety, herein. The plot is well-written and develops nicely, and those same qualities fit the characters, as well. The dialog contains lines from the original, and it is almost invariably very poetic. It's well-delivered by just about everyone, too. The acting in general is astounding. I doubt I could direct a single accusation of a half-hearted performance towards any of the parts in this. The score consists of grand instrumental pieces. The pace is a bit uneven, and with its length this can definitely be quite a mouthful. The effects, although I can't say for sure that none of them have since been touched up, as I watched this on a DVD recently released, are impressive, with few exceptions. Not all of the content in this is appropriate for all ages, though there is no nudity and little language. What violence there is has justification. I recommend this to those who want a well-visualized version, and, I'd presume, fans of the actor and film-makers. 7/10",The Ten Commandments
25,neil-476,"Overblown, bombastic, cheesy - I love it",8,22 March 2010,"No-one could throw money at a cinema screen quite like De Mille. Whatever the merits and faults of this movie - and there are many of both - it is always going to stand a fair chance of succeeding simply by virtue of bludgeoning its audience into submission with sheer overkill. One suspects that even God didn't have this big a budget for Exodus! And that is responsible for some of the worst elements of the movie - garish vulgarity sometimes (often, in fact) overcomes good taste.But on the other hand, this epic was the movie which made Charlton Heston into the go-to guy for epics. His Moses oozes solemnity, sincerity and gravitas. And is very nearly matched by Yul Brynner's Ramses. If it wasn't for the fact that King Mongkut was the role Brynner was born to play, Ramses would have been that role.The film looks lavish and feels lavish. The effects are still spectacular even if they haven't all worn well.And it tells the story well.",The Ten Commandments
26,gridoon2021,The Hollywood epic at its zenith,7,1 January 2018,"Cecil B. DeMille's last film (as a director) is an unparalleled spectacle. The sheer scale of the production and the amount of extras in the crowd scenes are mind-boggling. It also makes expressive, painterly use of color, and boasts groundbreaking special effects which deservedly won the Oscar (the parting of the Red Sea is an iconic sequence). Besides all the spectacle, it has some strong dramatic moments and much of the dialogue is literate, though at other times it can get pompous or campy (""What kingdom are you from?"" - ""The kingdom of the most High""!). The film can fill you with disgust not only at the inhuman treatment of the slaves (which probably was DeMille's intention), but also at God's unbelievable cruelty of mass-murdering Egypt's firstborns (which probably wasn't DeMille's intention). And the depiction of wickedness and evil as basically a wild party where everybody has fun and nobody is harmed (well, except for a potential sacrifice I guess!) is good for a laugh. Yul Brynner and Vincent Price stand out in the exceptionally large cast. *** out of 4.",The Ten Commandments
27,AaronCapenBanner,Epic Biblical Drama About Moses.,7,11 November 2013,"Cecil B. Demille directed this epic and very popular film about the life and times of Moses(played by Charlton Heston) from his exile as a baby to escape the death edict of the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses I, which would kill all first-born male Hebrew children, to his secret adoption by a pharaoh's daughter, where he grows to a high rank and respectability, only to be exposed as a Hebrew and exiled into the wilderness, where he would marry and be called upon by God to lead the Hebrews out of slavery and into freedom, part the red sea, and deliver the ten commandments from Mount Sinai. Superb production and direction, with Heston unforgettable and commanding as Moses. Film has some campy elements and performances, but overall is a memorable and beloved retelling of a pivotal part of history.",The Ten Commandments
28,Wuchakk,Spectacular and reverent Biblical epic,9,24 January 2016,"Released in 1956, ""The Ten Commandments"" is Cecil B. DeMille's cinematic account of Moses delivering the Israelites from bondage to Egypt, as chronicled in Exodus. Charlton Heston stars as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses, who later becomes Pharaoh. Anne Baxter co-stars as the beautiful but conniving Princess Nefretiri. Yvonne De Carlo plays Moses' wife while John Derek plays Joshua and Debra Paget his wannabe babe. Edward G. Robinson plays the traitorous Hebrew Dathan while Vincent Price plays a slave driver.The screenplay fills in the holes of the biblical account with some fictional characters and events, like Nefretiri and Moses' mother almost getting mowed over by a colossal block of stone. There are also some changes in the story, like Joshua seeking and finding Moses in the desert after decades and the way the LORD enacts judgment on rebels after the golden calf incident wherein the script borrows from the account of Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16).The sets, costuming, locations and special effects are colorful and spectacular while the drama is surprisingly compelling and moving. You can nitpick this or that, like Heston's stilted delivery after Moses becomes the promised deliverer and God speaking in Old English, but why bother when the film is so entertaining and even inspiring? The filmmakers used a lot of imagination in recreating what it was like for the Egyptians in the palaces and the Israelites in slavery. The sequences showing the Hebrews moving the aforementioned blocks of stone are awesome; as is the scene where Moses supervises the erecting of a towering obelisk. Brynner is outstanding as Rameses; he made baldness cool. As for women, Baxter, De Carlo and Paget are stunning, as are numerous peripheral cuties.The movie runs 220 minutes and was shot in Southern California, Egypt and Arizona.GRADE: A",The Ten Commandments
29,safenoe,The Ten Commandments - in the courtroom,8,14 November 2016,"I have wondered why American Christians are so rabid about having the Ten Commandments displayed in a court house. Why not Christians in the UK, Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and so on? Why just the USA?I think (and it's just a theory) it's because of the lasting influence of two movies...The Ten Commandments (the 1956 version) and Inherit the Wind in 1960. The Ten Commandments is a very influential movie, and Charlton Heston was born to play Moses. In a way, I think his strong persona allowed him to raise the profile of the NRA as a decisive figure with an authoritative commanding voice. Moses was chosen by God to lead the Jews out of Egypt, and this is a powerful and moving movie. It's a movie that any pastor would be happy to watch even though it's not technically a ""faith based"" movie. Anyway, I think a generation(s) of Christian viewers were influenced by The Ten Commandments and Inherit the Wind (the court room movie based on the Scopes Trial) and thought, hey how about we re- balance the rights of Christians by having the ten commandments on a court room wall? If only the Scopes judge had the Ten Commandments overlooking him from the court room wall...Never mind the fact that major decisions are made in other arms of government, and I don't hear Christians demanding the ten commandments be displayed in The White House or Congress or even a bureaucrat's office.",The Ten Commandments
30,SimonJack,Close to the Bible lesson and a true to scale epic film,10,30 September 2015,"One of the phenomenal aspects of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt was the sheer scale of the event. They were two to three million people (based on Ex. 12:37-38). They had many herds of cattle, flocks of sheep and goats, household belongings, and ""the spoils of Egypt."" To move such a mass of humanity and possessions across a desert to an unknown land was incomprehensible to the people then – Hebrews and Egyptians alike. And it must seem such to us today. That is an important aspect of the story, and its powerful lesson – that man alone could not achieve such a thing. Only God could do it. Any movie of the exodus that doesn't capture that sense misses the very essence of the story. Few films made to date have even tried to do that. The exception, and the model to judge all exodus films by, is this one. Cecil B. DeMille, remade his 1923 silent film and added 1 ½ hours to the ""The Ten Commandments"" film of 1956. It stands alone having captured a sense of the awe of the exodus. The movie was shot in Egypt and on Paramount sets in Hollywood. The vast scenes of Hebrew slaves working in the brick pits in Egypt gives a real sense of the enslavement of the Hebrew people more than 3,000 years ago. The scenes of building the city of Rameses and the hordes leaving the great city are spectacular. The sets for the elaborate Egyptian courts, temples, locales, and buildings are painstakingly reproduced from years of research and effort. The special effects are outstanding. Here, they show some of the signs of God's power. The film has just a few of the plagues and events during the exodus, but they are done most convincingly. Instead of swarms of flies and locusts, a famine and plague of frogs, this film has a tremendous storm of sizable hailstones that then burn with fire on the ground. The turning of the waters of the Nile into blood and some lesser scenes of special effects are all very good. The column of fire that blocks the Egyptians is spectacular. And no other efforts have come close to the fantastic scene of the parting of the Red Sea. The walls of water on either side actually appear as though strong winds are pushing and holding them back. The Bible says that the Ten Commandments were ""written by the finger of God,"" and the scenes with Moses on the top of Mt. Sinai show just that. Fingers of fire come out of the whirling column of fire that is God, in electrifying shots that burn the words into the rock. The later earthquake that swallows up Dathan and others who lead the rebellion against Moses and God, is excellent. The special effects, size of scale, authenticity of the land, sets and costumes all add to the greatness of this film. But it has much more, including an accurate and faithful recounting from the Bible of the exodus and this key part of Israelite history. And, central to that is the Passover and understanding it. I've watched half a dozen other films about Moses and the exodus, and don't recall more than cursory mention of the Passover in a couple of them. Yet, the Passover was such a crucial event in Jewish history (and Christian symbolism), that it must be the heart of any story about the exodus. But, as with any film of such epic proportions, this one isn't perfect. It is missing one aspect that is important to understanding Jewish history. That is the scouting of the Promised Land just a few months into the exodus. God was ready then and there to lead the people on their conquest of the land and its people. But the Hebrews rebelled and wouldn't trust God to lead them. So, he condemned them to the 40 years of wandering in the desert until all those over age 20 had died. More than 30 incidents of God's power during the exodus are covered in the early books of the Bible. All of these were preceded by the people grumbling, complaining or rebelling against Moses and God. To Jews and Christians alike, this is an important lesson from our past to remember. The fiction account of Moses growing up in the royal household is as possible and believable as any other. And, it's certainly entertaining. Wouldn't a boy in the Pharaoh's household learn physical skills and the art of warfare? Wouldn't such a youth be highly regarded by Pharaoh and the people? Wouldn't he have female admirers? And a love interest? These things make more sense for an imaginable account of some 30 years of the life of Moses, than many other fictional accounts. This film is faithful in its use of names from the Bible. It is accurate with other names that aren't given, from history and/or tradition. Seti I is the first Pharaoh in the film, and Rameses II is his son (played by Yul Bryner). His real mother is Jochabed (spelled Yochabel in the film), and pharaoh's daughter who adopts Moses is Bithiah. The character of Joshua is much more prevalent in this film than in the Bible, but here he is in the forefront for a romantic sub-story. Nefretiri (played by Anne Baxter) is a fictitious character as the early love interest of Moses (played by Charlton Heston). The huge supporting cast all excel. The detail and realistic recreation of costumes, uniforms, dress styles, and other aspects of ancient Egypt are outstanding. All the production aspects of the film are exceptional. The musical score rounds out the accolades for this great classic film.",The Ten Commandments
31,JamesHitchcock,A Fine Achievement,9,29 November 2009,"Cecil B. DeMille is often regarded as a specialist in Biblical epics, although these formed only a small part of his large total output. He made several epics, not all Biblical, during the silent era, and did his best to keep the genre alive during the thirties, a period during which it had gone into a decline, largely because of the difficulties of location shooting in the early days of sound.DeMille had made a silent film on the subject of ""The Ten Commandments"" in 1923, and in 1956 remade it in sound and colour. The film tells the story of Moses and the. Exodus, although it is not always faithful to the Biblical account. In this version Moses is believed to be the son of the Egyptian Princess Bithiah and is the adopted son of her brother, the Pharaoh Seti I. The film focuses on the supposed rivalry of Moses with the Pharaoh's own son Rameses. The two men are rivals for power and for the love of the same woman, the ""throne princess"" Nefretiri, who is destined to marry the next Pharaoh. (The relationship between Moses, Rameses and Nefretiri parallels that between Sinuhe, Horemheb and Baketaten in another epic set in Egypt, ""The Egyptian"" from two years earlier).At first Moses seems set to become the next Pharaoh; he has impressed Seti by proving his mettle as a military leader and as peacetime administrator, and Nefretiri is deeply in love with him. When, however, Moses discovers his own background as the son of Hebrew slaves, he abandons the idea of taking power in Egypt, is converted to the worship of the Hebrew God and plans to liberate his people from slavery. Rameses marries Nefretiri and becomes Pharaoh on Seti's death, leading to his final confrontation with Moses.DeMille was seventy-five in 1956, and in some ways this is very much an old man's film. It is conservative in its religious values, being as respectful as possible to the Jewish and Christian scriptures and traditions. It is conservative in its language; although most of the dialogue is not taken directly from the Bible it has a formal, Biblical ring to it. It is also conservative in its formal, stylised, non-naturalistic acting. In some ways it is the film the Victorians might have made about Moses had they possessed twentieth-century cinema technology.In other respects, however, this is a film of its time. The epic came back into favour in the late forties, as Hollywood saw spectacle as its main weapon in its battle with television, and ""The Ten Commandments"" is the most spectacular film of its period, with a massive cast and thrilling set pieces like the parting of the Red Sea. Today, this would probably be a simple task for the effects department, but in pre-CGI days it was something special. (The film deservedly won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects). The film may be conservative in its religious values but is surprisingly liberal in its political ones, foreshadowing ""Spartacus"" in its emphasis on racial equality and human dignity. This is shown by the development of the character of Moses. Early in the film he is an ""enlightened despot"" who can see nothing wrong with the idea that the Hebrews should be slaves of the Egyptians, although he treats them more humanely than does Rameses. Only later is he converted to the ideal of the equality of all men under God.The film has its faults, some of them connected with its casting. Nina Foch was too young to be credible the presumed mother of Charlton Heston, who was actually a year older than her. It would have been better to have cast another actress as the older Bithiah. Yvonne De Carlo, perhaps the loveliest of several lovely actresses in this film was always too elegant as the nomadic shepherdess Sephora, especially as the script suggests that Sephora is rather plain. Another weakness is that neither DeMille nor his scriptwriters grasped the differences between the fierce religious tribalism of the Exodus story and the ethical monotheism of the New Testament, so morally repellent episodes such as the Slaying of the Firstborn are presented as the just acts of a righteous God.The film's faults, however, are vastly outweighed by its merits. DeMille's previous Biblical epic ""Samson and Delilah"" is something of a failure, largely because of weak performances from its stars Hedy Lamarr and Victor Mature. Here, however, he can call upon excellent acting, especially from Heston who brings the required dignity and gravitas to the role of Moses. Heston receives good support from Yul Brynner as Rameses, a man who is not completely evil, but corrupted by the temptations of power and by his obsession with proving himself a better man than Moses, both as a leader and as a lover. Other noteworthy contributions come from Cedric Hardwicke as the wise old Seti, Anne Baxter as the vindictive Nefretiri and from Edward G. Robinson as the Hebrew Quisling Dathan who throws his lot in with the Egyptians.This was DeMille's last film as director. He acted as producer of ""The Buccaneer"" two years later, but was unable to direct it through illness. ""The Ten Commandments"" was, however, a fitting climax to his career, far more so than ""The Buccaneer"" would have been. (That film, as directed by his son-in-law Anthony Quinn, is a poor one, but I doubt if DeMille could have made it significantly better). It is a fine achievement, a film which is spectacular but which showed that the epic form could offer more than empty spectacle. At the date it was made it was probably the greatest epic ever. Later directors such as William Wyler (""Ben-Hur""), Stanley Kubrick (""Spartacus"") and Anthony Mann (""El Cid"") were to equal DeMille's achievement, perhaps even surpass it, but it was he who had laid the foundations on which they built. 9/10",The Ten Commandments

33,disdressed12,"good, but no masterpiece",6,1 December 2007,"while i will say this movie is good,i wouldn't say it is great.for one thing it is way too long.i mean that generally,but also many of the scenes went on way too long.there were some pretty impressive,even spectacular scenes.but for me,this movie is all about the spectacle.i found that a lot of the dialogue existed to simply to give several overwrought speeches.as for the acting,it wasn't bad,or anything.however the only standout,in my mind was Yul Brynner as Pharaoh Rameses. he was brilliant.also,i got the feeling while watching this movie that it may have been a vanity project,for director Cecil B.Demille and to a lesser extent Charlton Heston.and Heston was not that great in this movie.in fact,i felt he tended to overact at times.anyway,i did find the movie worth watching,but not the masterpiece that others have claimed.for me, The Ten Commandments is a 6/10",The Ten Commandments
34,sddavis63,An Impressive If Very Imaginative Spectacle,7,8 August 2008,"Watching this movie is a little bit like sledding downhill. At the beginning it's quite exciting and a lot of fun, but as you approach the end, the sled starts to slow down and eventually goes out with a whimper. The first half of Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"" is very interesting, attempting as it does to fill in the many gaps in the story of Moses, about whose early life we read very little in the biblical story, which skips over everything between Moses being discovered by Pharaoh's daughter to the point at which Moses joins his people in the fields. DeMille fills that time in quite imaginatively, and I must say that, in spite of the rather grandiose claim at the beginning of the movie that the story is based on history and Scripture, I think the bulk of this part of the story is based on DeMille's imagination. Nevertheless, it's quite entertaining and moves along at a good pace. Charlton Heston is - in my view - more accomplished as this young Moses than he was as the older Moses later in the film, when his makeup came across as increasingly unbelievable, to the point at which, at the end, he looked a bit like Santa Claus with the typical fake white beard and hair. Yul Brynner was quite believable as Rameses as was Nina Foch as Bithia. The introduction of a romance between Moses and Nefertiti (Anne Baxter) was not really necessary - a battle for the throne between Moses and Rameses would have been sufficient without a battle for a girl to go along with the throne. Still, the first half is pretty good.Things go off track a bit, though, starting I thought with the plagues sent upon Pharaoh and Egypt. They were skipped over rather quickly (with the exception of that against the firstborn) and the whole movie seemed to start to jump around a bit after this. DeMille didn't have as much free reign with the story at this point, because the biblical narrative, of course, is well known, but he tries to adapt it subtly but noticeably. Just one example of the adaptations is the golden calf story, which DeMille has preceding the giving of the Ten Commandments to the people, while in the Book of Exodus, that actually happens 12 Chapters after the giving of the Commandments. DeMille also has God carving the Ten Commandments on a stone and giving them to Moses to take to the people, whereas the Book of Exodus has God speaking the Commandments to all the people who are gathered at the foot of Mt. Sinai. I suppose one has to give credit to DeMille, because as a pastor I've noticed that his version of the giving of the Commandments is the dominant image that people have drilled into their heads - even those who are pretty biblically literate. DeMille also clearly portrays Moses as an archetype of Christ, starting with his birth being foretold by a star and Pharaoh being warned about the coming of a deliverer to the Hebrews, which causes Pharaoh to launch a plan to kill the male Hebrew babies (a la Herod in the Gospels after the birth of Jesus.) The problem is that according to Exodus 1 the reason for the killing of the male babies had nothing to do with the fear of a deliverer but was rather to slow the population growth of the Hebrews.Faults aside, this is a pretty good movie. I liked Edward G. Robinson's take on the character of Dathan, a Hebrew overseer of the slaves who becomes the one who constantly stirs up the people against Moses. It was also interesting to see Vincent Price in a role unlike his usual horror roles as the Master Builder Baka. With repeated messages from Heston about the evils of slavery and the equality of races, I found myself wondering what type of reception this movie would have received in the South in 1956. Overall, it's a very impressive movie, rightly called a spectacle, and even if it does slow down as it moves along, it's still worth 7/10",The Ten Commandments
35,gridoon,Lumbering but at least visually beautiful.,7,15 April 2001,"The narrative of this solemn, visually majestic biblical epic is so rambling that the REAL story (I mean, the ""interesting stuff"", after Moses discovers his mission and returns to Egypt) begins after about 2 hours and 10 minutes; most movies would be over by then, but De Mille has only managed to spin out the prologue. Considering that, along with the often hokey dialogue (near the end, during the ""orgiastic"" scene, the narrator tells us:""And there was sin, and anomie, and uncleanness, and violence, and rioting, and....etc""), the movie is often hard to sit through, but it does have its rewards: astonishing cinematography, solid acting by most of the cast and special effects that hold up very well after almost 45 years. (**)",The Ten Commandments
36,Robert_duder,"A brilliant, breathtaking epic of a film the likes of which simply have never been seen since",9,30 March 2013,"I have watched The Ten Commandments dozens of time as a kid. It was an Easter staple in our house just like millions of others. It has been years since I'd seen it and this time I got the opportunity to see it on the big screen. There is absolutely no doubt that this film defines what an epic is let alone a historical epic. It is a lavish, breathtaking, enormous film that works to bring to life history in every sense of the word. When you consider the timing of the film and what they had to go through to get the sort of special effects they accomplished, it is mind blowing. Compared to today of course the special effects don't stand up but watching the parting of the red sea, or the Egyptian landscape and the massive scale of every shot and realize this wasn't done with computers and CGI but rather painstakingly created...it is sheer brilliance. I have to be a little picky when it comes to the acting. As with many old films of old Hollywood some of the film feels very over-dramatic and even cheesy at times. Some of the actors seem rigid and they think they're belting out a line to a theatre audience rather than a film. The film is excruciatingly long. I can't fault them for making such an incredibly epic film covering so much of Moses' life but it really feels like it starts to drag at the end which is unfortunate because the red sea scenes are at the end and that is pure brilliance. Despite clocking in at nearly four hours the last few scenes feel almost rushed in an attempt to not make it any longer than it already was.I can't tell you how much I disagreed with Charlton Heston politically and morally but there is absolutely no doubting his incredible screen charisma. He exudes masculinity and heroism. He brings to life Moses in an epically biblical proportion like no other person could. Yul Brynner is equally larger than life as Rameses. Heston and Brynner's rivalry and chemistry on screen is part of what makes this film so amazing. Both Heston and Brynner do have some campy dialogue but somehow they both make it work. Anne Baxter is a legend in her role but in my opinion was one of those aforementioned characters in the movie that delivered their lines with a lot of cheese. She really overacts in every scene and while her beauty works, she isn't a stand out success. Edward G. Robinson is perfect as the slimy, villainous Dathan. He looks the part and plays it even better. Yvonne De Carlo, Debra Paget, and John Derek all deserve honourable mention for their performances in the film. The cast works so well together and they overcome any dawdling script issues which there are a few.I mean, what can you say about Cecil B. DeMille? The man is a legend and this film shows exactly why. This was a labour of love for him unlike anything I've ever seen. The sheer details that he went to in making this as closely historically and scripturally accurate is so impressive. The film endears itself to you because you feel like you are there in Egypt, in the time of Moses and few films can do that for you. Whereas some historical epics will bypass certain details in order to fit for time or dramatic element, it seems to me that this film misses nothing in the story of Moses. If you love historical epics...well you don't get many of them anymore. But this is truly where its at. It has to be seen to be believed and I am so glad I saw it on the big screen. It is the definition of a true classic. 9/10",The Ten Commandments
37,ElMaruecan82,Thou Shall Respect This Movie...,10,7 April 2021,"Whether as Moshe, Moussa or Moïse, one will certainly hold Moses in the highest regards if he belongs to one of the three one-God religions though several aspects of Moses' accomplishments won't leave non-believers indifferent (not every year in mankind history one man singlehandedly freed a whole people from whip-slashing tyranny and set the universal template of human laws). If none of that hits the right chord, then the movie fan will certainly be mind-blown by the way ""The Ten Commandments"" ticks every box of cinematic grandeur.Yet the film didn't even earn a Best Director nomination for Cecil B. DeMille: a man who had the humility to remake his own 1923 version that he retrospectively judged imperfect and incomplete and who'd suffered a stroke during the shooting and yet kept on filming, reducing his life expectancy. To add insult to injury, Elmer Bernstein was also snubbed for a score that defines today the peplum genre, and the Best picture award went to ""Around the World in 80 Days"". I call ""The Ten Commandments"" the Rodney Dangerfield of classic films: it got no respect. (And in 2008, the AFI compiled the ten best epic films of all-time and I'm still puzzled that it ended in tenth position... or was it a numerical tribute?)But time did justice to the film's legacy and even today's auteur dogmatic or superhero fans won't deny that the film features one of the most spectacular climax with no less than three iconic sequences one after the other, the parting of the Red Sea, the Mount Sinai tablet scene and perhaps the most iconic instance of party-pooping ever featured on screen, a thrilling and visually rewarding payback to a a three-hour buildup. Naturally, you shouldn't watch this film if you have a tight schedule, but it doesn't feel as long as it is: every scene builds to another, and chapters keep swelling up until the whole film literally splashes its splendor into our eyes like the Red Sea on Pharaoh's army.I can hear a few skeptical minds criticizing the formalism of the more static moments, but such flaws are dwarfed by the cinematic wonders from the costume details to the architectural prowesses. Indeed, any glimpse at any panoramic scene shot in VisioRama, tells you that this is a director's movie, from the man who gave his name to a Directing achievement award, at a time where imagery was generated by practical effects, miniatures, matte painting backdrops and last resort: animation. De Mille was one of these pioneers who magnified 'directing', the man with plus-fours and megaphone sitting on the top of his chair ad yelling his instructions to hundreds of extras, the man Norma Desmond gave her greatest closeup to.Before Spielberg, De Mille became a brandname for a certain vision of Cinema, a collective art, a commercial art to the degree that pleasing the audience was the one slavery he could accept even if a five-minute scene could mean months of preparations. Still, the film isn't there to show off its production value, there's a good deal of human drama in Moses' discovery of his own background and ensuing family dilemmas. There are quiet, cute, jolly moments relieving us from the whole heaviness of the project and emphasizing the human aspect in case we thought the film was just a matter of costumes, props, settings ""Thou"" this or ""Shall"" that. And so the success of the ""Ten Commandments"" is also the success of a casting.De Mille, a true Renaissance Man, noticed Heston's strange resemblance to Michelangelo's Moses statue, that look of alpha-male majesty graved in his face and oozing from his proud gaze at his triumphant return from Ethiopian, we see a prince, a true royal and progressively, the solemnity of his endeavor growing until it culminated in the figure of the bearded wise old-man à la Gandalf. As his fraternal nemesis, Rameses II played by Yul Brynner is a young man consumed by power and ambition, and translating his hubris with hypnotic death glares. Cedric Hardwicke is the benevolent Pharaoh Sethi, Martha Scott plays Moses' mother and as Nefethiri, Anne Baxter gives the most divisive performance as the slightly over-the-top but sneakily seductive woman who only cares for one thing: getting Moses. She still have the most memorable line of all :""Oh Moses you stubborn, adorable fool"". Judith Anderson plays the stern Memeth who triggers the plot. John Derek is the brave Joshue, and the greedy and treacherous Dathan's part was offered to Edward G. Robinson, a thankless role that he pulled off wonderfully.So even the little pictures within the big picture offer full satisfaction, though we all know what parts earned the film its ticket to immortality. And so there's a reason why this is the scene was replicated, in ""The Simpsons"", ""Mel Brooks"" or ""Bruce Almighty"", standing out from a year that featuredmany three-hour long movies. But the 50s audiences didn't really care: interrogating Charlton Heston as a mystery guest in ""What's My Line"", panelist Bennet Cerf said: ""Are you a star in one of these endurance-contest pictures"" he rephrased himself and called them ""four-hour jobs, super colossal spectacles"", thinking of ""War and Peace"" or ""Giant"" or the year's Best Picture winner. See, that's how the film was regarded, one blockbuster among many others. And since De Mille won the Best Picture for the lesser ""Greatest Show on Earth"", the Academy didn't think he was due a second tribute.But those considerations hardly matter as the film became the highest-grossing of all time, before ""Ben-Hur"", consecrating De Mille a cinematic film-Maker. And like the Makers addressing his followers, De Mille prepares us to his creation right before the credits roll. Interesting that Hitchcock did that the same year with ""The Wrong Man"", that was a time where directing meant something, where drama could be found in the Holy Scriptures and prophets were the actual super-men. Today, we have comics superheroes. O tempora, o mores...",The Ten Commandments
38,richardchatten,The 31 Year Old Anne Baxter,8,12 April 2020,"Since the Egyptian story was simply the prologue to DeMille's silent original, much of this 'remake' is simply filler, with results that like most late DeMille are almost comically talky and studio-bound; with all the genuine spectacle as usual left in the hands of Arthur Rosson's second unit and the special effects crew. And almost two hours too long. But it was made in the days when Technicolor was still worthy of the name, and faithfully observes the Commandment sternly handed down by Hitchcock that ""though shalt not bore!""To that end Anne Baxter as biblical queen bee Nefretiri (which when initially up for grabs in 1954 was described as ""the most sought after role of the year"") does the part proud, consolidating her recent transformation from girl-next-door to vamp by providing a chic fifties answer to Nita Naldi, clanking with bling in figure-hugging Edith Head gowns like Claudette Colbert had been poured into twenty years earlier as Cleopatra. When she later on largely disappears from the action, the mid-section sags badly until the action from the original prologue finally kicks in.Despite winning an Oscar for it's special effects they don't convince for a moment and matte lines are visible throughout the film whenever the principal members of the cast are supposed to be out of doors. The parting of the Red Sea and the handing down of the Commandments were actually done better in the original, but are here still spectacular enough to enhance this version's cherishability as high-flown kitsch.",The Ten Commandments
39,g-bodyl,Epic For The Ages!,9,12 March 2014,"Here is a story that will fill you with awe, with wonder, with such amazement. The Ten Commandments is an adventure-filled epic that is incredibly entertaining. Two things go against this movie and they are age and length. The film came out nearly sixty years ago so it has that old-time feel. But the special effects are great and do I dare say that they hold up relatively well today. The length could be problematic since it's almost 4 hours long, but I daresay the story will have enough here to hold your attention.Cecil B. DeMille directed an epic story based on the tale of Moses. We see the rise of Moses under the guidance of the Egyptian Pharaoh, Seti. But once word gets out of his Hebrew heritage, he gets cast out. But the Lord God commands Moses to return to Egypt in order to free his people from bondage.The film has wonderful acting from practically everyone. Charlton Heston in his first epic role does a great job as Moses. I loved his character transformations from beginning to end. Anne Baxter does a great job as Nefertiti, the girl in love with Moses. Edward G. Robinson does a great job as the guy essentially in charge of the slaves.Overall, this film truly defines the meaning of epic. The historical accuracy may or may not be correct, but there is still a great story being told. The special effects only enhances it especially when Moses meet God. The costume designs are great and it has a great, bombastic score. A bit lengthy, but still a wonderful epic based off a well-known story. I rate this film 9/10.",The Ten Commandments
40,vincentlynch-moonoi,A true classic epic,9,24 November 2011,"How much you like and appreciate this film probably depends upon three factors: how you feel about old-fashioned Christianity, how you feel about the excesses of Technicolor, and how you feel about Charleton Heston. Due to his conservative gun-toting beliefs, it's not easy for me to watch Heston, but I willingly make two exceptions -- this film, and Ben-Hur. This is old-fashioned story telling at its best, as told by a master story-teller -- Cecil B. Demille. And it shows...adjusted for inflation, it is the 5th highest grossing film in Hollywood's history.The only downer is that if you have a high definition television, the fact that many of the scenes are played in front of a screen behind which are projected realistic scenes of Egypt will be obvious...but again, this was 1957.The scope of the story is tremendous, and its length (220 minutes) reflects that. But, there's not a minute wasted. Particularly well acted are a number of scenes, including the one where Moses (Heston) learns of his true heritage. This is an interesting scene, too, because the acting is almost more of a classical nature, here. And, who can forget that first time they saw Moses part the Red Sea? Yes, today it looks rather cartoonish, but when you consider that this film was made in 1956, that special effects becomes very impressive.There are too many actors to give note to each of their performances, but I will mention a few: This was Heston's most impressive role to date, and indeed, he is commanding in this role. Yul Brynner, always low on my list as an actor, is, nevertheless equally impressive here as Pharaoh Rameses II; he really struts! Anne Baxter is wonderful as Nefretiri, the love interest of both Moses and Ramses. Edward G. Robinson -- though one of the bad guys -- is extremely effective as Dathan. I was surprised to learn that it was Yvonne De Carlo who was playing Moses' wife...quite a good performance. John Derek, as Joshua, is very good here. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is impressive as Pharaoh Seti, as is Nina Foch as Bithiah, the adoptive mother of Moses and sister to Seti. The venerable Martha Scott is wonderful as the natural mothers of Moses (just as she was later the mother of Ben-Hur. Henry Wilcoxon is another face you'll recognize and appreciate...this time as Pharaoh's charioteer. And I was happy to notice H.B. Warner (the druggist in ""It's A Wonderful Life"") as a sick old man.This is such a classic film that anyone interested in American cinema ought to watch it attentively at least once. Definitely one for the DVD shelf.",The Ten Commandments
41,redryan64,"""Take Two Of These Tablets.........""",10,28 June 2014,"BRINGING SUCH AN epic to the screen and doing any justice would surely be a monumental task. It would be a crap shoot for the studio that made the picture and obviously guys like Adplph Zukor and Jesse Lasky at Paramount Pictures were gamblers. As it turned out, in the hands of Director, Cecil B. De Mille, it proved to be a sure thing.PEOPLE OF ALL faiths within the Judeo-Christian traditions lined up to see it at premium exclusive showing prices. In our case, we went on a field trip from St. Theodore Elementery School to see it. Making our pilgrimage from the South Side location to McVicker's Theatre, 21 W. Madison Street in Chicagp's Loop. The year was early 1957 and we were in the 5th Grade.ALTHOUGH THE FILM is shown regularly on network television on a yearly basis (around Easter/Passover time), and we have seen it several times, it does remain a big-screen picture. Its special effects, such as they are, have a much greater effect on viewers.A VERITIBLE ARMY of actors, cameramen and technicians were assembled. The roll call of those starring or featured in this film reads like a Who's Who of Hollywood. Heading up the cast, of course, is Charlton Heston along with Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo, Debra Paget, John Derek, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Nina Foch, Martha Scott, Judith Anderson, Vincent Price, John Carradine, and tons of other names that you may or may not recognize.AS AN INTRODUCING sidebar to this story, we recall that Charlton Heston stated during interview that the role cost him many invitations to cocktail parties and other get togethers.

42,didi-5,the ultimate Biblical epic,7,28 November 2004,"Fantastic, overblown swan-song by DeMille, remaking his silent epic and giving it the following pluses: eye-popping Technicolor; Charlton Heston throughout as Moses - from innocent bullrush teenager through to white-bearded bringer of stone tablets; the burning bush with the voice of God (in an American accent!); the golden calf and Edward G Robinson; Yul Brynner's scary Pharaoh; and, of course, the majestic parting of the Red Sea. There's also the bulging biceps of John Derek, but you can't have everything ...'The Ten Commandments' has everything you could wish for in a Biblical epic - sticks turning into snakes, horses and chariots disappearing into an out-of-control Red Sea, ponderous and sometimes laughable dialogue, appalling miscasting (Anne Baxter?), and an absolutely over-powering visual theme. Will probably be trotted out annually on TV forever, and probably deserves the hype. Does it compare favourably to the 1920s version? Well, it is bigger, brasher, and more entertaining. It's well worth a look.",The Ten Commandments
43,Dr_Coulardeau,A most human story,10,12 September 2009,"This film is mythic but time has been harsh on it. In 1956 the Cold War was not exactly helping the West, the USA and Hollywood to be in any way open-minded and tolerant. This film is a Christian caricature wrapped up in some Jewish garb that does not change the message: freedom is no freedom if it is conquered at the price of the enslavement or death of other people. The message is not ""Let my people go!"" but the Jews – hence the Christians because in the USA it is the same when they talk of the Bible – are right, they have God on their side, God is all-powerful almighty omniscient and extremely vindictive and punishing. The vision of such a God and having such a God as a reference in a culture is nothing but fundamentalism, extreme sectarianism.They forget that Hebrews and Egyptians are both Semitic, that the Semites in the Middle East who came from Egypt around 120,000 years ago but left the Middle East and the Levant around 80,000 years ago to come back only around 35,000 years ago, came back from Egypt precisely and Judaism was invented in the Levant probably 3,000 years BCE, 5,000 years ago. The first figure of this culture is Abraham and the main Semitic culture that developed from 6,000 years BCE in the Levant was the Phoenicians. Then my question is how did the Jews manage to become the slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt or how did the Jewish faith manage to spread among the Egyptian slaves? In a way or another how did either the Jews or Judaism manage to be brought into Egypt and then how did the Jews become slaves or how did Judaism spread among the slaves?The film takes it for granted that the Jews were slaves in Egypt without answering these simple questions. And that is not acceptable from a standard western critical mind's point of view.Then the God of these Hebrews or Jews is a God of vengeance and a God of punishment. The problem emerges here and there nicely but is never really discussed in any way. These Jews are against their being slaves but they submit to any kind of easy domination, be it that of a golden calf or bull or cow or oxen, a sterile golden representation of a bovine animal, or be it two tables of stone with ten commandments (and Mosaic law is a lot more than just ten commandments: it is bigger than the Napoleonic Code). They accept their golden idol in the name of freedom, the freedom to be dominated by an image, the freedom to enslave their own brothers and sisters to their impulses and desires, sexual, morbid or criminal, or the freedom to be dominated by a God that imposes commandments and laws, much more than just ten commandments indeed with the power of all natural elements against disobedient individuals, under duress and menaced, if not terrorized, into fright and fear, if not just submissive loss of any critical mind or individual beliefs. And I will not say anything about the criminal vision against the Egyptians. Pharaoh kills the Jewish newborns or menaces to kill the Jewish firstborns and Moses turns it around with the help of his God, Moses' God, who will kill all Egyptian firstborns while passing over all Jewish houses that would have spread some lamb blood on their door frames. Not only is it primitive but what's more it is unacceptable: you cannot use the weapons of your opponents – and the word enemy is an unacceptable word and when it is used we must understand that my enemies are not declared as such by me but are declared as such by themselves, and I am supposed to forgive my self-declared enemies because they are not my enemies and they do not know what they are doing. This film uses the Old Testament in the worst possible way because it turns that Old Testament into a weapon of narrow-minded bigotry, meaning God is the God of the Jews and it will destroy all the non-Jews who would in any way speak or act unfavorably towards the Jews. It is the absolute negation of man's critical mind both among the Jews who must obey that God and his commandments and laws, and on the side of the non- Jews because they cannot in anyway even silently think the Jews might be wrong in slightest way, and not only in their faith but in all their acts and thoughts. You cannot criticize anything Jewish or any Jew without at once being called anti-Semite. Then the film is at least one hour too long. It enjoys being slow and descriptive instead of using ellipses and shortcuts. We all know the story. And luckily it did not give all the plagues like the locusts for one example. But even so the film could have been shortened and the film could have given some proper detail about the great trip to Palestine. What about the bronze snake? And they were pushed back by the Canaanites. They were thus obliged to go North and go around the Canaanites to then take them from the West, literally in their back and they destroyed as many as possible and Canaanites were forever rejected because they refused to give their land ""graciously"" that is to say free and without any resistance, and I guess become servants, which is a clear synonym of slave in the old Testament when it deals with non- Jews. This film has aged and it is in a way rather surprising that it still inspires some Christian minds. Jesus has so little to do with Moses. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The Ten Commandments
44,filipemanuelneto,"An epic, very theatrical but visually great.",8,1 March 2017,"We are facing one of the most consecrated biblical epics ever made and the magnum opus of Cecil B. DeMille. The story is well known, most people know the Bible even without having read it. Concerning the work of the cast, it's great even if we consider that they're overly theatrical and lack here some veracity and naturalness, essential to play in cinema. Charlton Heston is the great actor of the film, in the role of Moses. Yul Brynner was also excellent as Pharaoh Ramses, as Anne Baxter in the role of Nefretiri. Edward G. Robinson surprises in the role of the hypocrite Dathan. But what makes this film particularly intense is the beauty it has. The setting is one of the biggest that Hollywood has ever made, with thousands of extras with carefully detailed period costumes. Everything was thought to the detail and we love all this visual show. Of course, historical accuracy has been left in the background. DeMille had his school on Broadway and might not attach much importance to the historical details but knew how to make a great show. The visual and special effects are quite realistic, the state of the art of cinema of this time, and still can seem credible today, more than fifty years after it's premiere. The soundtrack of Elmer Bernstein is strident, betting heavily on metals and percussion, in a clearly symphonic style that was thought to make everything even more grandiose. In short: it's a consecrated epic that many people still watch, almost religiously, at Easter (in Portugal it's normal to be broadcast on TV in this period, year after year). The big problem of this film is the very theatrical dialogue and acting. It looks like theater. But we can forgive this fault because it's more or less overshadowed by the visual and sound show.",The Ten Commandments

My eyes are filled with the spectacle and heart is filled with faith on mighty God. The Ten Commandments provides never seen before visual spectacle and also educates people on ethics of life. I don't remember seeing anything bigger than this before it's release and that evokes me to say that, The Ten Commandments is Father of all Magnus Opuses. Some people complain about the film being silly at many occasions because it includes mythological and magical stuff but isn't it better to believe it as a part fiction if you're an atheist or believe God's superpowers if you believe in him to enjoy the ride. You can't stand to make such a big film unless you have strong story in hands and what else can be better than telling the tale of God almighty? Cecil B. DeMille delivers a magnus opus that totally blown away the audience which ultimately happens to be his last project. The Ten Commandments is blessed in every department such as acting, writing, visuals, scale, execution, cinematography, score and storytelling. Those big sets, painting, Egyptian culture, costumes, accent, conflicts in the story, a message to educate people on ethics given by God, everything works. The Ten Commandments was unbeaten until William Wyler brought another Grand biblical #BenHur and how lucky Charlton Heston is to be the lead hero of Two Biggest Spectacles ever made on earth. Commercially, The Ten Commandments is the 6th Biggest Hit ever in Hollywood and I can't deny that the film deserved it because it gave audience an Experience of lifetime.Rating- 9/10*",The Ten Commandments
48,bsmith5552,DeMille Goes Out on Top!,9,15 January 2018,"""The Ten Commandments"" was Producer/Director Cecil B. DeMille""s 80th and final film in the Director's chair. In a career that began in 1914 with ""The Squaw Man"", this was arguably his best film. It tells the biblical story of Moses with all the spectacle and glamour one could expect. The special effects, including the parting of the Red Sea are legendary. The film runs almost four hours and is divided into two main parts.The first part deals with Moses' life as an Egyptian prince and ends with his first encounter with God on the Mount Sinai. An edict issued by Rameses I (Ian Keith) decreed that all first born Hebrew children were to be slain in order to kill the promised deliverer of the Hebrew people. Moses is saved by his mother Yochabel (Martha Scott) who places him in a basket and sets it afloat in the Nile. Egyptian princess Bithiah (Nina Foch), the daughter of the Pharaoh saves the Hebrew baby, names him Moses and takes him as her own swearing her sinister servant Memnet (Judith Anderson) to secrecy.Moses grows to be Charlton Heston having distinguished himself in battle and winning the favor of the new Pharaoh, Sethi (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) over his natural son Rameses (Yul Brynner). Both men seek the favor of Princess Nefretiri (Anne Baxter) who is to marry the next Pharaoh. When Moses builds Sethi's new city and gains further influence with Sethi, Memmnet decides to expose Moses as a Hebrew. Nefretiri intercedes and kills the old servant but leaves Moses' swaddling blanket in full view. Moses discovers his heritage and renounces his privileged position. Rameses is now the new Pharaoh as Rameses II and banishes Moses to the desert.Moses manages to cross the desert and comes upon the camp of the shepherd Jethro (Eduard Franz) and his seven daughters one of whom, Sephora (Yvonne DeCarlo) Moses marries and with whom he has a son. Life goes on until Moses is drawn to Mount Sinai where he encounters a burning bush through which God directs Moses to return to Egypt and free his people.Part 2 of the story follows Moses' efforts to free his people. To do so, He causes the Nile river to turn red, brings several plagues upon the Egyptians and finally causing the first born of every Egyptian family, including Rameses II' s own son to die. Moses and his people are released from bondage and begin the pilgrimage to the Promised Land. However, Rameses decides to send his chariots after the group to slay them. But following the celebrated parting of the Red Sea, they are swallowed up and drown. Rameses then decides to let the Hebrews go their way even though Nefretiri maintains her love for Moses.When Moses and the Hebrews reach Mount Sinai, Moses goes up the mountain for 40 days and nights to await God's further direction. Meanwhile the slimy Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) fires up the crowd convincing them that Moses has abandoned them. With the help of Moses' brother Aaron (John Carradine). they build a golden cow as a false god. Moses is meantime receiving the ten commandments of God from the master. Moses decends the mountain and is furious when he sees the Golden Calf and all the sinful activity around it. He loses it and....................................................................................................This film made star Charlton Heston a major star and cemented his career as a biblical/ middle ages type leader. Brynner is excellent as Rameses and conveys a certain regal quality in his role . Robinson is good as the evil Dathan who takes the young Lilia (Debra Paget) unto himself in order to free Joshua (John Derek) from death. Anne Baxter is suitably seductive as Nefratiri.Other notables in the large cast include DeMille regulars Henry Wilcoxen, Julia Faye, Francis McDonald and Olive Deering as well as, Vincent Price as the Master Builder Baka who also covets Lilia, Douglas Dumbrille, Frank DeCova, and John Miljan as the blind man.It is interesting to note that Marsha Scott played Charlton Heston's mother both here and in ""Ben-Hur"" (1959) while Olive Deering played a character named Miriam both here and in ""Samson and Delilah"" (1949).",The Ten Commandments

This is one of them. The legendary saga is taken from various tribal beliefs, early desert texts and original books in the bible. None however are taken from ancient Egyptain scrolls as their history makes no mention that such man ever existed or any monumental events took place. Nevertheless, few audiences come to see this film for historical accuracy, instead they sit with childlike fascination at the incredible special effects seen throughout the movie. Viewing this film, ""The Ten Commandments"" as a child, creates awe and wonder at the possibility that such a man could have ever lived. As an adult, the film continues to fascinate us, but now its just to enjoy the excellent casting and stage performances of such screen legends as Charlton Heston as Moses, magnificent Yul Brynner as the Pharaoh, Rameses the great. There is sly and crafty Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, the overseer, handsome John Derek as Joshua and Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Sethi the I. Vincent Price is impressive as Baka, The Master Builder and John Carradine as Aaron. Seen nearly every year as repetitive as The Wizard of Oz, this movie reigns supreme as one of the few which emerged as a true Classic. ****",The Ten Commandments
50,dfranzen70,Let my people rent this.,9,9 April 2019,"Pretty much the definition of an epic, this long, long movie details the life of Moses, raised to believe he was a prince of Egypt but finding out he was a son of a Hebrew woman trying to save him from certain death. Later he wanders the desert, talks to plants, calls forth some plagues, performs some miracles, and has women like Anne Baxter and Yvonne De Carlo fighting over him. Definitely Heston's finest moment. And although it apparently revived Edward G. Robinson's career, I don't think he was a good fit for this particular piece. But it is sweeping, and it is vast in scope, and it does have a cast of thousands (approximately). Even Carl Switzer (Alfalfa) shows up, although I couldn't spot him.",The Ten Commandments
51,PWNYCNY,Anne Baxter should have won the Academy Award for Best Actress.,10,4 August 2005,"When will Paramount Pictures re-release the 1956 movie The Ten Commandments to movie theaters? I know that the movie is shown on television and is on DVD, but this epic and incredibly successful movie is meant for the theater. Besides having a great cast, the movie tells a great story and tells it well. This movie will resonate with today's audience. Today's audience would enjoy watching Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Yvonne De Carlo, John Derek, Debra Paget, Edward G. Robinson and the others in the cast and would greatly enjoy the finale, including the parting of the Red Sea and the creation of the actual Ten Commandments. Technologically, the movie compares favorably with today's movies. Today's audience would respond favorably to the rich colors by Technicolor and to the music by Elmer Bernstein. In addition, the movie will help educate a new generation about events in history that have had a profound and lasting impact on the world. It will introduce the audience to powerful and memorable characters such as Moses, Ramesses, Sethi, Nefreteri, Bithiah, Aaron and Dathan as well as provide a glimpse of ancient Egypt. The scene where Moses confronts Ramesses and demands, ""Let my people go!"" is iconic and will definitely make an impression on today's audience. Today's audience will appreciate Anne Baxter's powerful performance. Why keep this movie in DVD land? Let it spread its wings on the wide screen in theaters for all to marvel. Watched this movie again and again this movie warrants only superlatives. GREAT story, GREAT cast, GREAT acting, GREAT special effects, GREAT costumes, GREAT EVERYTHING. This movie is one of the greatest epics ever produced by Hollywood. The scenes with Yul Brynner and E. G. Robinson and Charlton Heston are iconic; the scenes between Mr. Heston and the beautiful Anne Baxter are cinematic gems. Moreover the story is told in a straightforward way giving the movie the continuity it requires to stay on track, which is essential for a movie that is almost four hours long. Moses was a hero, Rameses his nemesis and Nefeteri the woman who had and then lost the man she loved, a Hebrew man named Moses.The acting is stagy, but the story is great, and Charlton Heston IS Moses. This is Charton Heston's greatest role. He is what makes this movie work. Heston gives one of the greatest performances in the history of Hollywood. Whether as the prince of Egypt, or as a slave, or as a shepherd, or as a leader and a prophet, Charlton Heston is the central player in this story. Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, E. G. Robinson, etc., are great in their supporting roles too, but this is Charlton Heston's movie. This movie conveys the intensity of a time when a people held in cruel bondage were soon to be freed and were soon to be led by someone whose emergence onto the scene is so improbable as to confound everyone around him. For who was Moses? Was he an Egyptian posing as a slave? Was he a Hebrew masquerading as an Egyptian prince? Was he a prophet? Or was he an opportunist, using the plight of the Hebrews to gain a following and thereby confront and defeat his rival Rameses? The movie raises these questions. Now the movie may not be historically accurate, but that's not important. What IS important is the story this movie tells, which is about a man who is on a mission to liberate an entire people from the shackles of slavery and sacrifices everything - wealth, power, the love of Pharoah's daughter - to accomplish what he sets out to do - and does it.There are some critics who make fun of this movie for its stagy acting and stodgy story. Well, this is complete balderdash. Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston were never better and Anne Baxter is positively beautiful. The movie is a story about liberation, redemption and hope. It's about people who were led from the house of bondage and became a nation, guided by the great and profound prophet, Moses. That this movie is remembered over fifty years after its release is proof enough of its timelessness.",The Ten Commandments
52,PWNYCNY,Maybe the greatest movie ever made in American cinema,10,22 November 2019,"The Ten Commandments is one of the greatest movies ever made in the history of American cinema. It has all the elements of a great movie: a great story, great acting, lots of action, lots of romance, lots of conflict, all tied into a coherent story that has a beginning, a middle and and end. The movie engages and then keeps the audience's attention. One cannot help but root for Moses to succeed. He is the symbol of righteousness and hope, and of a man who is chosen to do great things, not for material gain but for a much more sublime purpose: to liberate people from oppression, in this case real, grinding oppression. The movie contains many scenes that today are iconic: his service to Pharoah, his return to the Pharoah's court in chains, his love affair with Nefretiri, and most of all, the court scene with Rameses, the parting of the Red Sea and his return from atop Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments. This movies succeeds in withstanding the test of time. It is either dated nor corny. The acting is superb. Every member of the cast, from top billed to the thousands of background extras, deliver powerful performances. In this movie the background extras play a prominent role. For this movie is not about a few persons. it is about a moment in history that affected and changed the whole world. Moses is on a mission and nothing will stop him from fulfilling what is his destiny. Moses forfeits all material wealth to serve a higher cause, the cause of freedom. The movie is over three and half hours long, but time flies when watching this movie. That is because there is nonstop action. Everything in this story is intense. People are being ruined but through faith attain salvation. In the movie, Moses was not a fraud. He is not a false prophet. He delivers on his promises. He is a hero, and who doesn't like watching someone be a hero?",The Ten Commandments
53,mjneu59,the widest of widescreen guilty pleasures,10,6 January 2011,"Cecil B. DeMille reads between the lines of Holy Scripture and rewrites the Book of Exodus, with enough color, claptrap, and spectacle to fill several bibles. In a modest prologue the director himself introduces the film, claiming it to be ""based on historical documents"", including one particularly Gnostic text which (quoting Egyptian princess 'Nefretiri') refers to Moses as a ""sweet, stubborn, adorable fool"".The production is a textbook exercise in epic entertainment, with Charlton Heston stepping into the mighty sandals of Moses and leading the nation of Israel out of Egyptian bondage, parting the Red Sea along the way. After such a show-stopping climax the encore carving of the actual Commandments atop Mount Sinai can't help but seem anti-climactic, and still requires some clarification: what kind of example does the Author of 'thou shall not kill' set by slaughtering the firstborn of Egypt and drowning half the Pharaoh's army?DeMille approaches the story with all the gravity of a religious crusade, which of course only amplifies its many guilty pleasures. The film was made for true believers, but perhaps only an unrepentant freethinker could appreciate such hammy declamation of truly classic cornball dialogue. And with a running time of 3-hours and 39-minutes, thank the Lord His inventory of commandments ended at ten.",The Ten Commandments
54,CubsandCulture,"It is more enjoyable as a fantasia than as a ""historical"" film",10,1 March 2021,"Undoubtedly my religious views color my perception of the film but DeMille's jocular, spectacle style does not lend itself to nuanced human drama. Instead, this film is a pitched melodrama built around some frankly silly concepts but for all that the film is highly enjoyable. As DeMille's final directed feature it is more than a fitting swan song; it is cromulent summation of DeMille's career.The film is at its best when the focus is panoramic and dealing with the large strokes of the story. the film's production values are illustrative like a comic version of the Bible. If nothing else the film strikes the eye in its grandeur. The parting of the Red Sea is one of the more successful effects of the 50's. While other effects are not as polished the film still manages to be an engaging body of technical work.The performances are uniformly engaging-which isn't necessarily to say good. Heston is bombastic and the rest of the cast try to keep up with him. The actors all look the part but do not expect nuance here. This is a old fashioned adventure. It is best to leave the film at that level.",The Ten Commandments
55,JasparLamarCrabb,An Absurd Masterpiece,5,15 May 2006,"One would think ancient Egypt was built of ham given the unusual amount of overacting lurking around. Charlton Heston is Moses, Yul Brynner postures a lot as Ramses, and Anne Baxter is the heavily made-up Nefreteri. They're all terrible. Heston makes Brynner look like Brando and Baxter pouts and does a lot of heavy breathing whenever Heston is around. Also in the mix are Judith Anderson, John Carridine, Vincent Price, Edward G. Robinson, Cedric Hardwicke and Yvonne DeCarlo. An absurd masterpiece by one of the most ridiculous directors of all time. Cecil B. DeMille clearly thinks of himself as GOD..or at least God's proxy...he narrates this claptrap. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ranks up there with VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, MOMMIE DEAREST and BEYOND THE FOREST as one of the all time camp classics. There's hardly a line of dialog that isn't some sort of twisted metaphor or didactic lecture. It should be enjoyed on that level and nothing more..",The Ten Commandments

He was successful in a genre - the epic - that he made definitely his own, until William Wyler came along three years later with ""Ben Hur.""In his first epic role, Charlton Heston is cast as Lord Moses, prince of Egypt, son of the pharaoh's sister... As a true prince, he saves a slave's life; as a great prince, he gives the priest's grain to the slaves and one day in seven to rest; as a man of justice, he confronts Nefretiri with a piece of Hebrew cloth, the key to his origin; as a warrior and in excellent physical condition, he kills a tough and cruel master builder; as a courageous Hebrew, son of slaves, he tells the pharaoh: ""It would take more than a man to lead the slaves from bondage, but if I could free them, I would!"" As a man of prowess, he shows his latest methods of combat when he takes on the shepherds and routed them; as God's torch, he proves to be the Deliverer of the Hebrews, their prophet and leader; as the Lawgiver of the Covenant, he is the founder of the community; and as interpreter of ""The Ten Commandments,"" he is an organizer and legislator...Yul Brynner is superb as Rameses, the rival of Moses... His arrogance and swaggering snobbery are well represented... Brynner delivers an intelligent cynical role... Regarding himself as divine, he rejects the demand of this unknown God and responds by increasing the oppression of the Hebrews... Anne Baxter is Nefretiri, the sensual princess who leaves her scar upon Moses' heart... Nefretiri is beautiful as a jewel, and her eyes green as the Cedars of Lebanon... For Moses, she is always ready to lie, to kill and betray... She is selfish in her life as certainly in her love... Edward G.

57,barnabyrudge,"Impressive in scale and execution, in spite of stilted moments.",7,27 March 2007,"To mount an epic movie based on the story of Moses delivering the slaves out of Egypt is an ambitious and logistically challenging task at the best of times. To have done this in 1956, without the aid of computer-enhanced effects for believable crowd scenes or real-looking historical sets, is more remarkable still. When our screen is filled with tens of thousands of soldiers or slaves, stretching right to the horizon, what you see on the screen really was in front of the camera. That level of resourcefulness and organisation is staggering to think about, and makes The Ten Commandments an admirable achievement by any standards. Having said that, there are moments when you might find that the epic proportions of what is before your eyes creates a stronger impression than the ""divinely inspired story"" (as Cecil B. DeMille calls it in his introductory speech).It is prophesised in Ancient Egypt that a Hebrew slave will be born who will one day deliver the other slaves from a life in chains and lead them to freedom. Jittery, the pharaoh demands that all first-born Hebrew babies must be slain to prevent the prophecy from coming true. One Hebrew family put their baby son into a basket and cast him onto the Nile, hoping that he will somehow reach safety from this awful fate. Instead, the baby floats right into the gardens of a royal palace, where he is found by Bithiah (Nina Foch) She takes the baby as her own and names him Moses. Years later, Moses has grown up within the Egyptian royal family and is revered as a noble, wise and resourceful Prince of Egypt. One day he may even become the next pharaoh, much to the envy of the existing pharoah's birth son Ramases (Yul Brynner). Moses and Ramases are also locked in a battle for the affections  and eventual hand in marriage  of the beautiful Nefertiri (Anne Baxter). Ramases spends most of his time plotting a way to discredit Moses so that he might beat him in their mutual race for the throne and the woman of their desires. Then, unexpectedly, Moses learns about his true ancestry. When he discovers that he is, in fact, of Hebrew birth parents he forsakes his royal status and becomes a slave. After many years of hardship - including a long period of being banished into the wilderness - Moses learns from God that he has been chosen to deliver the slaves from their appalling existence in captivity. He returns to Egypt and leads his people to freedom.Cecil B. DeMille had already made this film, under the same title, in 1923. This lavish and expensive remake is a better film though. Heston is excellent as Moses  the role requires tremendous presence, and he provides it in abundance. Brynner is also very good as Ramases, etching a character whose burning envy towards his rival is convincing and memorable. At times, the dialogue is a little stilted and lofty; at other times it is actually quite eloquent (the parts narrated by De Mille himself are especially articulate). Elmer Bernstein's score is appropriately stirring, and the cinematography by Loyal Griggs is truly outstanding (hard to accept that Griggs lost out in the Oscars that year to Lionel Lindon's work in Around The World In 80 Days!!) The Ten Commandments features some fabulous cinematic highlights  the 10th plague, the parting of the sea, and the writing of the commandments are a few that spring to mind. In between the highlights the film has its lulls, but even at an elephantine 220 minutes it never lapses into total boredom, and is well worth catching if you're a fan of biblical epics or old-style Hollywood pageants.",The Ten Commandments
58,3xHCCH,Biblical Melodrama at its Most Memorable,7,29 March 2013,"I think I have not seen this film since ""The Ten Commandments"" was the only movie being shown in theaters during Holy Week. Despite the length of four hours, the only thing I really remember about it was the Red Sea scene, and maybe that is more because of the poster than the film. This Maundy Thursday, I decided to revisit this grand classic film, the last film of renowned director Cecil B DeMille.While I was watching, I recognized several scenes by bits and pieces only, especially in the first half before the intermission. The scenes in the second half were more memorable. This whole matter about the Egyptian princess Nefretiri (whom I am not really clear what the nature of her close relationship is to the Pharaoh Sethi was) played by a very campy Anne Baxter, I do not remember AT ALL. Maybe I was still too young back then to understand the flowery-worded melodrama involving her double-dealing character, and how she affected the relationship of Moses (an outstanding Charlton Heston) and Rameses (a believable Yul Brynner). I was touched by the sympathetic treatment the production had for Pharaoh Sethi (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) and his sister Bithiah (Nina Foch). The scene of Moses meeting his mother Yochabel (Martha Scott) was very moving. The overseers Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) and Baka (Vincent Price), were contemptible with their hammy villainy.But you can really see why this biblical epic was an instant classic back then, and up to now. The ""cast of thousands"" it boasts of in the poster is literally true (no computer-generated crowds back then. The sets and costumes were incredibly grand and colorful. The Oscar Award- winning visual effects (parting of the Red Sea, turning water into blood, etc...) were impressive considering that this was made back in 1956! While I am sure these effects would have been done differently with the advanced technology now, the last plague which simply depicted the Angel of Death like a green mist creeping on the floor can still elicit fear in the audience. OK, the burning bush scene could be done much better now, but the memory of seeing Moses' physical transformation when he came down from Mt. Sinai with that incredible brush-up hairstyle change could not be replicated.",The Ten Commandments
59,myriamlenys,they don't make them like that any more,8,10 April 2020,"""The Ten Commandments"" is based on the Biblical story about the life and times of Moses ; I won't insult your intelligence by repeating it here. However, the movie represents a lavishly melodramatic take on that story. It's a weird combination, pretty much the cinematic equivalent of a flying refrigerator or a railway station equipped with hanging gardens, but somehow the thing works. ""The Ten Commandments"" may be long, but is hugely, consistently entertaining.The movie is also hugely spectacular. Director Cecil B. DeMille threw a giant heap of money at the project, investing in titanic sets and stunning special effects, and every dollar is out there on the screen. Some of the scenes have become iconic, such as the parting of the Red Sea : once seen, never forgotten. The parting is a supreme achievement, unlikely to be bettered even in modern times crawling with computers and computer-generated effects.Charlton Heston does well enough as Moses, but it's Anne Baxter and, especially, Yul Brynner who steal the show. Brynner's prince (later on, pharao) Rameses may be a nasty piece of work, but he's profoundly human and his increasingly futile and deluded battle against the God of Israel takes on a certain daffy nobility, like a stray kitten with three legs hissing at a majestic tiger. The scene of a defeated Rameses coming home to his vicious and terminally estranged wife is deeply poignant : here you've got two people who have lost everything, even the power to pity and console each other. What remains is a desert.So ""The Ten Commandments"" certainly has its assets. However, I would not call it the deepest movie ever made about the Bible or about religion. Entertaining, yes, spectacular, yes, bold and memorable, yes - but there's also a certain superficiality, as in a tale told to Sunday School children.Like a whale, the movie tends to resurface regularly, especially around the times of Easter or Christmas. (""Ben-Hur"" is another one of these evergreen Easter or Christmas offerings.) There's nothing wrong with that, but viewers may want to vary their diet by tackling a number of other, more demanding movies about faith and religion. For example, ""The mill and the cross"" should do very well during Holy Week, as a meditation on the Passion of Christ and on the suffering of the innocent.Finally it should be noted that the movie represents some very very strange casting choices where the race or aspect of the characters is concerned. Who would have thought that some of the inhabitants of ancient Egypt or Israel were born in Kiev, Liverpool, Paris ?",The Ten Commandments

Demille's grand epic is always a great film to watch, even if you know virtually every line and every action that is going to happen. To take on a grand epic like this took guts, and DeMille achieved grace and beauty in one of the grandest spectacle's to ever hit a silver screen. From the grandness of the sets to the amount of extras, sets, colors and special effects shots used in this film, a film like this would probably never be made by today's standards and costs. Hopefully, someone will retell the story, updating the special effects and all, but until that day happens, this film will suffice.",The Ten Commandments
61,Steffi_P,"""Let him rave on that men shall know him mad""",8,19 May 2010,"If you get to know your way round classic cinema, sometimes you can imagine the personalities behind the productions just by watching the pictures themselves. By the mid-1950s, ancient world epics were becoming standard studio output and were being made in every way conceivable – from canonically biblical to shamelessly pagan, from action no-brainer to meditative drama, everyone was doing it. Then into the arena steps an ageing Cecil B. DeMille, the man who practically wrote the rulebook on this genre. ""Make way, make way!"" he seems to be saying, ""This is how it's REALLY done"" First of all, it's worth remembering that despite his overwhelmingly religious subject matter DeMille was never one to follow scripture to the letter. He was far too much of a colourful character (not to mention a commercial pragmatist) to do that. And he admits as much in his spoken preface to The Ten Commandments, saying how the bible omits large chunks of Moses' life, and his writers have plugged the gaps with various Hebrew texts. And then, in the opening credits, various sources are cited, before the announcement of ""The Holy Scriptures"" in bold font, like the headlining act at a concert. It wasn't that DeMille was disrespectful. In fact the opposite – so convinced was he of the bible's literal veracity, it made absolute sense to him to weave its stories into those of any other historical text.Of course, DeMille was just the front man, and he got someone else to do the weaving for him. A gaggle of writers, including two of DeMille's favourites, Jesse Lasky Jr. and Frederick M. Frank, have constructed what is admittedly a sweeping, adventuresome biopic of the prophet. It is among the more dignified screenplays penned for a DeMille production, with no silly motivations or daft twists. The only thing which is a bit suspect is the dialogue, which is full of stupid and pretentious turns-of-phrase like ""So, did you see the light after seven days of darkness?"" Oh, and the characters are completely one-dimensional, but who needs more in such a comic book world? You see, DeMille's pictures aren't about thought-provoking depth. For him it's all about the presentation. DeMille was one of the most painterly directors out there, arguably even more so than Vincente Minnelli who was a painter in real life too. The Ten Commandments contains some of his finest classically inspired compositions. Aided by the breathtaking cinematography of Loyal Griggs, which creates whole areas of colour out contrasting light schemes, he evokes the religious artwork of the renaissance – that of Michelangelo, Titian, Rafael, and many others who may or may not have had turtles named after them. DeMille is an artist as they were, but people and props are his brushstrokes. The movement in his shots is often stilted and theatrical – just like it was in his earliest silent pictures – so as to preserve that iconic look.With this in mind, it seems appropriate that DeMille's cast are bunch of posers, many of them wooden as mannequins. Charlton Heston, at this stage in his career, was little more than an impressive physique with an authoritative voice. Anne Baxter (she of the ""bitch virtuosity"" in All About Eve) gives probably the dullest performance of her life. John Derek is simply dull whatever he does, and incidentally his only ""winning"" streak was a string of Worst Director Razzies in the 1980s. Of the rest, most of them are actually very good – especially Yul Brynner, Nina Foch and Edward G. Robinson (a real bit of genius casting as the conniving Dathan, but ridiculed at the time) – but each of them is really there for their looks and general demeanour, not to act their hearts out. Think back to DeMille, the painter. When these people ""act"", their job is to strike poses that are symbolic rather than realistic indications of character. Hence we see things like a huddle of women stricken in awe as Moses makes his pronouncement – imagery taken from stained glass windows, not from real life.The thing that is most revealing about DeMille, is that his grandiose presentation is entirely without discrepancy. At one moment, he reveals the majesty of God in a glorious sunset or a smouldering mountaintop, the next he is making us gape at the magnificent pagan idols of ancient Egypt. Even the debauchery of the golden calf scene is more alluring than reviling, and one gets the impression the DeMille was a bit more familiar with this sort of thing than he would have let on in public (and he was – check out the Simon Louvish biography). And it's hard to know quite how to take the picture's casual acceptance of Old Testament misanthropy. It seems that, whether you are an atheist or a believer of any stripe, there is probably something for you to get offended by in The Ten Commandments. But you could look at it another way. You could ignore the context, and just enjoy the spectacle. Take DeMille's swansong for what it is – good old-fashioned movie-making fun, done as only he knew how.",The Ten Commandments
62,truemythmedia,A Classic for a Reason,8,26 April 2019,"""The Ten Commandments"" is a film which comes preloaded, for me, with many feeling which have nothing to do with it's quality. On the one hand I want to divorce myself from these feelings as I review it but on the other, I want to acknowledge them because many of these feelings are a result of the tremendous impact this film has had on our culture and the medium of film.I remember watching this film as a child on Easter Sundays in the little living room of my Grandma Quick. This film aired on TV every year, so in some ways it doesn't feel like Easter to me unless I have kielbasa, ham, potatoes, and Charlton Heston ('""Ben-Hur"", ""The Agony and The Ecstasy""). It's accidental that this movie holds such nostalgia for me but like many accidents the causes of it are easy to see.This last of Cecille B DeMille's features was also his grandest spectacle. It still ranks as the 6th highest grossing film (adjusted for inflation) of all time. It was nominated for 7 Oscars and won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects (effects we might laugh at today were cutting edge in their day) and was such a huge production that while it went over budget by over 50% of its original budget, you can really see the reasons see why.",The Ten Commandments
63,Spleen,"So big it's in danger of falling over, but it doesn't",9,28 August 1999,"I'm always willing to watch this, and I always enjoy it.  Rather than admit that there is something wrong with my taste, then, I've come to the conclusion that it's actually rather good.  It clearly has class, and spectacle.  Perhaps it has other virtues as well.Say what you will about De Mille's stagy style: it fits the Old Testament. Whereas ""The Prince of Egypt"" went soft and new-agey when it came to the crunch, De Mille never lets us forget the harsh world events are taking place in.  With a powerful and capricious god glaring at everyone all the time, it's not surprising that people - even pagans - take to talking in speeches.  (The speeches are in an attractive, flowery style that isn't biblical but has the same aesthetic standards as some biblical writing.) And the god really has some Old Testament flavour.  Everyone is terrified of him, and for perfectly rational reasons would rather pretend that he doesn't exist.  This gets tiresome after a while.  You'd think that after watching the Red Sea part everyone would have been willing to admit that Moses courted SOME kind of supernatural influence.  On the other hand, you'd be a mug to trust this influence too far.Possibly the best thing about the movie is the way it manages to divide our sympathies without weakening them.  Yes, we're on the side of the Israelites.  But it's also hard not to be on the side of the Egyptians. The old Pharaoh is probably the most likeable character on display and the young Pharaoh, while he has his flaws, is a nice enough fellow done in by unfortunate circumstances.  Moses gains our empathy early and keeps it even when his beard has turned to marble.  Only the minor characters are villains - and they're fun, too.Of course, I say all this knowing full well that the entire film is, at the same time, completely ridiculous.  Well, what can I say.  It's yet another instance of a general law.  Simple sincerity can sometimes spin straw into gold.",The Ten Commandments
64,EdgarST,VistaVision Dreams,6,2 May 2004,"Every Easter Biblical movies are shown on television but ""The Ten Commandments"" at least around these shores- had been absent for many years. Its reappearance is more than welcome, for it is one of the most sincere camp megaproductions ever made, in screaming Technicolor and with a wonderful cast. I had two memories of this movie: the first -when I was a little boy and taken to the cinema by the priests of the school where I was educated- had a strong impression on me, as a huge spectacle; but the second, as a 1970's disco entity probably not in my senses, caused me the opposite impression, as I found it corny and extremely long. Now as a mature being, I find quite interesting that it is a mixture of both impressions: it is huge, it is corny and it is too long: it spends too much time with Anne Baxter bitching and Yul Brynner posing, and it ends abruptly. There is no way one can defend it as a great achievement in the history of cinema, but I believe that Cecil B. DeMille was sincerely convinced that he was making a masterful movie, and his sincerity shows. That, in the end, is a saving grace in the midst of all the kitsch surrounding him.",The Ten Commandments
65,winner55,"Oh Moses, Moses, you dam' fool!",1,29 September 2007,"If Charlton Heston wasn't sure he could over-act before he made this film, he certainly proved it to himself - and everybody else - here. It's hard to believe in a 'prophet' who can't seem to lower his voice below a shout.What's really sad about films like this is that it plays well for people who deeply believe themselves to be devout Christians, even though the Sermon on the Mount makes so little sense to them, they tell their children to ignore it, ""nobody could live that way"".Of course, this is the ""Old Testament"" story, so references to mercy and justice and charity are somewhat out of place, anyway. DeMille, quite accidentally, has played up and reminded us that ancient Judaism was an essentially tribal religion. How it became an all-embracing world religion and how it spawned Christianity in that process, is a long and complex story - and why bother if you can load the screen with beefcake heroes, rivers flowing backwards, chariots, and dancing girls? And it's just as well Heston over-acts like he's just taken Angel Dust, because everyone else underacts embarrassingly. Most notable are Edward G. Robinson - looking like a toga-wearing '30s B-movie gangster - and Yul Brynner. Brynner especially sleepwalks the film, looking dazed and confused; clearly awaiting instructions from the director that never arrive.Why is DeMille considered a great director? Because Americans love a truly clever con-artist. We know that DeMille, selling beefcake and cheesecake and special effects, is garnishing all this with the words many call 'sacred' in our culture, even though we don't really believe in them. He is not only playing to our baser instincts, but also to our hypocrisy.Anyway, his film has no right to condemn any 'Golden Calf', because it is itself a golden calf, an idol of the herd.",The Ten Commandments
66,Gislef,Epic Schmepic,3,20 November 1998,"Oh, please - the dialogue sounds like it flowed from the pen of Ed Woods (really - check out the Memorable Quotes).  It takes forever for the plot to get anywhere, and the Moses/Nefretiri romance wouldn't be out of place in a afternoon soap opera.  Charles Heston must curse this movie with every other breath, so badly did it typecast him for years to come.  The F/X are impressive, and a lot of money was also spent on cast and locations.  With its annual Easter showings on network TV, it's perhaps the most memorable of the old-style ""epics,"" but it just doesn't stand up to scrutiny.",The Ten Commandments

Cecil DeMille made huge effort here, and the presence of such top-level stars as Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner make it nice to watch. But then, all those inaccuracies creep in, The Bible is left somewhere aside and alone, all the typical melodrama scenes add to the overwhelming feeling of utter silliness and way too heavy handedness. Heston is OK as Moses, he does a good job, while Brynner is Okay but way too modern. Female parts are all wooden and stifled, at least, in general, they seem to be very unnatural and false. What is always felt, is a uneasy feeling of the film not being deeply Biblical or authentic in delivery. it all seems to be a large loud but boring stage show, of 4 hours.

68,mike48128,One of the 10 Best Motion Pictures of All Time,10,15 April 2017,"Parts of the film are ""hypnotic""! The epic retelling of the incredible Exodus from Egypt by the Hebrew Nation. The story of Passover. Wikipedia may be wrong about how many times this movie has aired. I seem to remember 2-night broadcasts as far back as circa 1970, always on ABC(?) It was ""split"" as Moses was cast into the dessert by Pharaoh. The real intermission occurs about 20 minutes later, as released. Several minor edits for TV include the infamous opening scene when a guard runs his sword through a first born Hebrew child. Some (apparently code objectionable) harsh language between Pharaoh and his betrothed is also cut, with reference to him treating her like property or an animal. Such edits are minor. Unintentionally funny in spots, with various English accents and catch-phrases. (""Oh! Moses, Moses"") Often regarded as a work of fiction by many, every attempt was make to make it as historically accurate as possible, using biblical and rabbinical works as well. Thousands of extras. Lustfully done, with some slightly ""salty"" language and rather melodramatic staging and dialog. Attempts to successfully remake this classic have (usually) failed, due to the extremely vivid performances by the actors. Multiple well-deserved awards and a rousing musical score by Elmer Bernstein. Wonderful costumes, amazing sets, impossibly rich Technicolor, and stunning cinematography. The parting of the Red Sea was later ""colorized"" as bluer for re-release. In the original, it was more greenish. One of the most famous and effective optical special effects of all time. Also, still one of the top grossing films of all time at the time of its release. No animation studio is credited with its special effects, so it is assumed to have been all ""in-house"". Cecil B.DeMille's finest and final film, and he died soon after completing it. It cannot be truly appreciated on even a ""giant"" home screen or a typical multiplex. I saw it in the ""60's"" re-release in ""Super-Panavison"" in an old theater with a huge screen! It was breathtaking!",The Ten Commandments

Everything is just so grand: the music, the sets, the whole scope of the story, and even the acting. Charlton Heston as Moses is truly one of the greatest heroes of all time. Such an epic and beautiful film, this is one everyone must see. Even if you're not religious there's so much in store with this film. A masterpiece.",The Ten Commandments
70,jacobs-greenwood,Cecil B. DeMille's last film is an epic retelling of the Bible's Moses's life,8,12 December 2016,"One of the highest grossing films ever, it features Charlton Heston, Academy Award winning Special Effects, and an all-star supporting cast that includes: Yul Brynner as Rameses, Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora. Debra Paget at Lilia, John Derek as Joshua, Cedric Hardwicke as Sethi, Nina Foch as Bithiah, Martha Scott as Yochabel, Vincent Price as Baka, John Carradine as Aaron, and more.After hearing rumors about the birth of the deliverer who would free their Jewish slaves, Egyptian Pharaoh Sethi decrees that the first born sons of Israel must die. But Yochabel, determined to save her newborn, places him in a basket, floating it on the Nile. Her daughter Miriam sees it is retrieved by Princess Bithiah of Egypt, Sethi's sister who, having just lost a child, claims the infant as her own.She names him Moses and the boy is raised as a Prince of Egypt that rivals Sethi's own son Rameses to become the next Pharaoh. Moses is favored by Nefretiri, the beautiful princess that's been promised by Sethi to whomever he chooses to succeed him. Unlike Rameses who exhibits a cruel streak, Moses shows compassion for the oppressed even though he doesn't yet know that he's a Jew. After building a great city for Sethi with master builder Baka, Moses appears to be the next in line until Bithiah's servant Memnet reveals the truth.When the Princess tells Moses, he seeks Bithiah and then Yochabel, meets his brother Aaron and sister Miriam, before disappearing among the slaves to learn about their hardships. When Baka decides to detain a Jewish girl for carnal purposes, her boyfriend Joshua tries to save her, but then must be rescued by Moses, who kills Baka. When Moses reveals to Joshua that he too is Jewish, it is overheard by Dathan, a Jew charged by the Egyptians to oversee his own people and to identify the promised Jewish deliverer if found. Dathan uses the knowledge to bargain with Rameses, who grants him his freedom and a position of prominence. Moses is forced to confess his crime in front of Sethi but Rameses decides not to make him a martyr. Instead, he spares Moses' life, and banishes him to cross the desert.After surviving the journey, Moses happens upon an oasis where he helps seven sheepherder's daughters and eventually becomes a shepherd working for their father, marrying his eldest daughter Sephora. Years later when Moses and his wife have a son, Sephora spots a man trapped on a hillside; it's Joshua, escaped from the copper mines where he'd been spared death by Dathan. At Joshua's urging, Moses climbs Mount Sinai to meet his maker; he's beckoned by a burning bush. God speaks to Moses and tells him to take up the fight, free and lead His people out of Egypt. When the shepherd asks how, He tells Moses that His power will be revealed through the staff. An older and wiser looking Moses descends Mt. Sinai.Moses is received by Pharaoh Rameses; Queen Nefretiri is at his side. Speaking God's word, Moses tells Rameses to ""Let my people go"". But Rameses is not impressed, so Moses has his brother Aaron lay down the staff, which turns into a cobra. Rameses claims that it is merely a magician's trick, and has his high priests lay two of their staffs beside it. After these also turn into cobras, Moses's cobra devours them. Rameses is still unimpressed, and remains so even after the staff is used to turn the Nile red with blood, and Moses causes burning hail to fall from the sky, and darkens the sun for 3 days.When Rameses mocks God by condemning the first born of Israel to death, Moses realizes that the Pharaoh's words will kill all first born Egyptians. By nightfall, death descends upon Egypt but passes over those (Jewish) houses whose doorways had been painted with lamb's blood. Finally, because his own son is dying, Rameses summons Moses to tell him to take his people and go, and the great exodus from Egypt begins. However, Nefretiri goads Rameses into pursuing and killing them all. So Pharaoh and his men in chariots rush across the desert to find Moses and the others (trapped) along the banks of the Red Sea.The people still doubt God's power until Moses summons it with his staff, causing a column of fire to stop the rush of Rameses's troops, and parts the Red Sea for their escape. Once they are safely on the other side, Moses raises his staff to close the sea upon their pursuers, killing them all. Pharaoh returns to Nefretiri but, before he kills her with his sword, she insists on seeing Moses's blood on it first, saving her life by confirming his complete failure.At the foot of Mount Sinai, the people are restless; they haven't seen Moses in 40 days and some fear that he may even be dead. Dathan uses the moment to decry that Moses hasn't led them to the promised land, and that they should make their own idol – a golden calf – to worship. Aaron is bullied into making one and an orgy begins, ironically, at around the same time that God appears to Moses as a tower of fire and speaks while flames carve 'ten commandments' into two stone tablets.Moses descends from the mountain, catching the people committing unspeakable acts, in direct violation of God's new laws. He proclaims them unworthy and casts the tablets at the golden calf, which bursts into flames and sinks into a crevasse that envelopes the non- believers.DeMille narrates that the people had to roam the desert for 40 years before they were allowed to cross the river Jordan into the Promised Land, and Moses passes his staff to Joshua.",The Ten Commandments
71,sme_no_densetsu,Colossal biblical spectacle,8,29 May 2008,"This Cecil B. DeMille epic tells the story of Moses, an Egyptian prince who, after learning of his Hebrew origins, strives for the liberation of his people. Adjusted for inflation, it's one of the biggest box-office hits of all time.Clocking in at over three and a half hours, this is the sort of film that defines the term 'epic'. There's a large cast, wonderful sets and special effects galore. No doubt, this must have been mind-blowing back in 1956. Yet, the film only managed to nab one Oscar.The acting is in good hands with a large cast that's well stocked with talented actors and actresses. Charlton Heston in particular delivered a career-making performance that strangely went un-nominated for an Oscar. Other notables include Yul Brynner, Edward G. Robinson, Cedric Hardwicke and the entrancing Anne Baxter.The story is entertaining and the instances of divine intervention provided ample opportunity for some interesting special effects. Granted, those effects are nowhere near today's standards but even the least convincing of these efforts still possess a certain charm. I should note that the film won it's sole Oscar for the Special Effects, perhaps the most impressive of which is the famous parting of the Red Sea.The direction by DeMille is assured and the film also boasts an Elmer Bernstein score. Not among his very best, mind you, but it definitely has it's moments. I wish that the film hadn't relied so much on blue-screen technology but I guess that the budget was already high enough without adding even more location shooting.While your enjoyment may be affected by your religious background I think that it is an intriguing story regardless. Certainly a must-see for anyone who loves epic films.",The Ten Commandments
72,frankde-jong,"The film lasts for more than 3 hours, but it is a biopic of someone who became 120 years old.",7,11 April 2020,"Having seen the 1923 version of ""The ten commandments"" from DeMille just a day ago, it was my intention to make a comparison of the two movies. This turned out te be rather useless because the two films are, despite the same title, totally different.In the 1923 version there are two stories (the biblical- and the present day story), in the 1956 story there is only the biblical story. In the 1923 version we follow Mozes when he is 80 years old, in the 1956 story we follow him from 0 to 120 years old. The 1923 version begins where the 1956 version is already 2 h 40 m underway.The difference that striked me the most when I compared the two films (nevertheless) was the scene with the dancing around the golden calf. Despite the fact that he is telling a biblical story, DeMille liked to dress his ancient characters with rather revealing clothes. After all the huge production costs (spectacular set pieces, many extras) had to be earned back. The scene that lends itself the most for this approach is the orgie scene with the golden calf. This scene is much more provocative and erotic in the 1923 version than in the 1956 version. May be surprising at first sight, but not if you know about the production / Hays code that was in effect from 1934 - 1968.When it is difficult to compare the two versions of ""The ten commandments"" with each other, comparisons with other films are more fruitful. Commenting on the 1923 version I compared it with ""Intolerance"" (1916, D.W. Griffith). Commenting on the 1956 version I would like to compare it with ""Ben Hur"" (1959, William Wyler). Both films tell a biblical story (""The ten commandments"" from the old testament and ""Ben Hur"" (somewhat less explicitely) from the new testement), both films have Charlton Heston as lead actor, in both films the walk of live of the main character is more or less the same (from nobleman (Ben Hur) / prince (The ten commandments) to slave, to guest from the Bedouins in the desert to hero (Ben Hur) / apostle (The ten commandments).Both ""The ten commandments"" as ""Ben Hur"" are great epic films with a classic status. When I am obliged to choose I would choose ""Ben Hur"", although I would have a hard time explaining why. Maybe it is because in ""The ten commandments"" both the director and the lead actor have a bombastic style. In ""Ben Hur"" William Wyler succeeded to a certain extent in discouraging the bombast in Charlton Heston, Cecil B. DeMille only encouraged it. Maybe it is because in ""Ben Hur"" the biblical character (Jesus Christ) was not the main character. The main character was his contemporary Judah Ben Hur. This gives a somewhat more detached view on the biblical story. Last but not least ""The ten commandments"" lacks a brilliant scene such as the chariot races in ""Ben Hur"".",The Ten Commandments
73,lambiepie-2,Excellent!,10,20 April 2003,"This film is the film that made me want to learn all there is to learn about the total process of film making. I have seen this every year I can remember, every time they show this on TV. As I grew older, I went out to purchase it. I just purchased it again on DVD. This film, for its time had everything, and everything is put together so well. It's not just the story of Moses, it takes you into the time with film techniques that were rarely used or unheard of for its time.Many people will not that some of the acting was ""over the top"". I think not, I feel the casting was deliberate for the characters. The direction was wonderful, I learned what ""a cast of thousands"" meant in the old Hollywood system. Every part of filmmaking was used to get this film to the screen, the music, the editing, the script, the sound, the animation, the costumes, the colors, the casting of white AND black actors...you name it, it's here. And let's be honest, there are some films based on stories of the Bible that are..okay, and some that should have NEVER been done. This is THE film that was done, and done almost perfectly. This film is grand, its epic, a MUST see whether you are religious or not. To me, one of the three best films of all time, ever made.",The Ten Commandments
74,miguelneto-74936,Cecil B. DeMille's a lesson in how to make movies with great limitations.,10,11 November 2016,"The Ten Commandments is one of the best biblical films of all time, in my opinion second only to Ben-Hur, the film is technically amazing, that still more time was released, it had many limitations, Cecil B. DeMille makes a direction excellent, stunning scenes, my favorite scene is when Moses is the classic opening of the red sea, the final scene also it is with the tablets of the commandments, while people are sinning, the cast is excellent, Charlton Heston this great, a curiosity is that Heston is the main in my two favorite movies biblical, the Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson and etc, the script is good, the film has a good pace, more can be tiring because it is a very long film, has almost four hours, plus 4 hours were well spent, the Ten Commandments is technically perfect for the time it was launched, with an excellent direction of Cecil B.

75,TheUnknown837-1,the greatest of the biblical epics,10,12 April 2008,"Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 film ""The Ten Commandments"", a retelling of a story he had previously filmed in the era of the silent films, is often regarded, and is regarded by myself, as the greatest of the biblical epics in film history, and there are quite a few of them. Charlton Heston plays Moses in a role just as fantastic as his role in ""Ben-Hur"", if not greater. Yul Brynner is the cruel, hard-heartened pharaoh of Egypt who refuses to let the Hebrew slaves go free, and all those that follow under the almost endless list of cast members are stars and long-remembered screen legends as well as faceless, nameless, but great performers who helped bring this epic to life.The film is quite an achievement in entertainment and this is really saying something concerning its length. DeMille's earlier version of the film was two hours in length and that was fairly long for a silent movie. His 1956 version is close to four hours long and yes, it does seem a little slow in a few places. I am a little thankful for the intermission, for it gives me a chance to get up and stretch my legs, because four hours is a long time to sit still. Regardless, afterward, I can sit down and enjoy the second half without faltering my enjoyment levels. There are a lot of wide-angle, one-camera shots with long speeches of well-acted dialogue scenes that may seem, and will inevitably be dull and uninteresting to some viewers, but to me, they were masterful. Anybody who appreciates great film-making, or respects the faith and events upon which this film is based, will cherish it.Special effects wise, the film is a noteworthy achievement given its age. Even fifty-two years after its big-screen debut, the effects are still impressive. The parting of the Red Sea sequence is simply spell-binding, even today. And if it's astonishing today, you can guarantee it awed the audiences in 1956. The sequence were Moses turns his staff into a cobra and then vice versa was also well-done and convincing.And of course, ""The Ten Commandments"" is fairly faithful, if not entirely faithful, to the story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt. This is entirely necessary and even though it is not a big action-packed adventure story (don't be alarmed, there is some very entertaining action sequences) it still plays itself very, very well. The plagues are the same plagues described in the Bible, the characters are the same, the events are true.In short, ""The Ten Commandments"" is a masterful film. Even at four hours in running time, it plays itself out flawlessly as high entertainment and with great appreciation for the story of Moses and how he led God's children from bondage and the cruelty of slavery.",The Ten Commandments
76,classicalsteve,"Rather Over the Top, but Heston as Moses Parting the Red Sea Worth a DVD",8,3 August 2008,"There is a challenge for 21st-century audiences to absorb the epic CinemaScope extravaganzas that were made in the 1950s. For some reason, filmmakers of that time felt compelled to apply the grandeur of their stories with about 4000 sledge-hammers. If there is anything that can be said of Cecil B Demille's 1956 remake of his silent epic, it gets straight to the point. Film-goers wary of subtlety need not worry about losing their entertainment investment. However, if your taste is for delicate sensitivity, complex character development, and the blurring of ""good"" and ""evil"", this might not be quite the film for you. Let's face it, none of the characters depicted in the Book of Exodus in the Old Testament are terribly multifaceted. Moses was good and on the side of God, and Ramses II was not only evil but vain. I guess in biblical terms, the two go hand-in-hand.That said, it is almost impossible to imagine any other acting except Charlton Heston being able to portray Moses and pull it off without it getting cheesy. Like Jesus of Nazareth, George Washington, and even Superman, Moses is almost beyond casting because of his wide-spread legendary status--among the religious and the non-religious alike. And yet, Heston seemed born to play the Jews' most revered figure. There is a biblical flair to Heston. Although he is not a great character actor like an Edward G. Robinson (who also stars) or a Dustin Hoffman, Heston is one of a handful of film performers whose mere presence is enough to fill the movie screen. Sometimes you wonder that the screen doesn't burst at the seams when one of these guys walks into it. And that is very much how a lot of Jews and Christians see Moses: as this larger-than-movie-screen figure. And the scene where he parts the Red Sea is one of the great cinematic triumphs of the 1950's.The supporting cast is also terrific, particularly Yul Brynner as Ramses II who brings an appropriate exotic flair juxtaposed to a conniving selfishness as an Egyptian prince then a Pharaoh. Anne Baxter as Nefretiri and Edward G. Robinson as an Egyptian citizen turned Hebrew sympathizer (sort of) are worth honorable mention.The wonderful aspects of this movie are the spectacles. The large Egyptian cities, the Egyptian throne room, the Voice of God (apparently also Heston), the creation of the stone tablets, and of course the Parting of the Red Sea. And, I should mention, hearing Heston say the famous line which we still repeat thousands of years after the fact: ""Let my people go."" is definitely worth the price of the Special Edition DVD.Now, the weaknesses. First and foremost is the narration, which I assume quoted passages from the Book of Exodus. The narration for me was not only over-the-top but superfluous. In many of the narrated moments, the narration simply described exactly the on-screen action. In one sequence, when Moses has been exiled from Egypt, he wanders through the desert nearly dying of thirst, and the narration says he wandered through the desert dying of thirst. I think I got the point. At times I wanted to mute the sound and just watch. In the 1950's, a lot of these kinds of films included narrations, a stylistic convention of the time that has not withstood as well for later audiences. Modern audiences become impatient (maybe even insulted) with on-screen omnipresent narration unless they truly add something above and beyond the action. Did filmmakers really believe their audiences were too dumb to figure things out?Another aspect that unfortunately dates the film is the music. It seemed every time Moses opened his mouth for a revelation, giant brass choirs belted out the musical theme of the movie, followed by large cymbal crashes with trills in the woodwinds and tremolos in the strings. Ad infinitum, over and over again. Having hours of triple-forte music gets a little grinding. The huge tutti passages made sense at the Parting of the Red Sea, but it was overused in so many other less-than-dramatic places that it diminished its intensity for the climactic moments.And there are other moments when the movie seems like a stage play. When crowds of people are standing around listening to a pronouncement, do they really start repeating the words of the speaker so obviously amongst themselves? When a proclamation is made that the Hebrew slaves can no longer make stones with straw to build the Egyptian cities, you literally hear about 900 people say ""No straw?"" I have never actually seen this kind of behavior except in older movies and musicals, like The Music Man.Still, all things considered, The Ten Commandments is one of the great epics of the 1950's, and not to be missed unless you detest visuals of the sky accompanied by large belting orchestral music. Or you're less than enthralled with Biblical epics. I must admit, the scene in which the recently liberated Hebrews start worshipping the Golden Calf made me feel like I was in cinematic slavery...",The Ten Commandments
77,hall895,Undeniably epic,7,19 December 2008,"Few films are as epic as director Cecil B. DeMille's final film, The Ten Commandments. It's certainly epic in length, clocking in at a stunning 220 minutes. So yes it's a very long film, probably a little too long for its own good. There are good reasons you don't see Hollywood churning out 220 minute movies anymore. But while there are undeniable lulls in the story and there are times where you really wish DeMille could have moved things along a little more briskly in the end this is film-making on a grand scale. Everything about the film is grand...the sets, the effects, the cinematography, the costumes, the sheer multitude of extras who fill up the screen. Making this film today in the age of computer wizardry would be so much simpler. The fact that this film was made, and made so well, in 1956 seems almost miraculous.The film tells the Biblical life story of Moses and as such the film's title is somewhat misleading. Anyone familiar with the story of Moses knows that those famous stone tablets are not going to show up until rather late in the proceedings. If anyone's story could justify a 220 minute film it is Moses. It's all here, from his start as the baby in the basket to his final destiny. It's certainly a compelling story and DeMille brings it to wonderfully vibrant life, helped in no small part by the magnificent, powerful performance of Charlton Heston. Few actors would have been up to the task of performing this exceptionally challenging role. Heston pulls it off brilliantly. It's a performance worthy of the spectacle DeMille has created around him. And this film sure is a spectacle.In a cast of thousands Heston is the obvious centerpiece but there are may other standouts as well. Yul Brynner plays off Heston wonderfully as Moses' chief antagonist and rival for the Egyptian throne, Rameses. Brynner is strong, resolute and perfect for the role. So many other familiar names...Edward G. Robinson, John Derek, John Carradine, Vincent Price...the list goes on and on and each member of the cast does a great job. Nobody seems out of place. Aside from Heston and Brynner probably the most important role goes to Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, the Egyptian princess who desperately wants to be with Moses but who would be forced into marriage with Rameses should he ascend to the throne. In a film which is always solemn and serious Baxter adds what at times is a desperately needed lighter touch. Some may say her performance is a bit campy but in the grand scheme of things it works.Appreciate the spectacle. We'll probably never see a film quite like it again. That is not to say the movie is without failings. The story doesn't quite sustain itself all the way through, the first half seeming to be more compelling. The second half of the film, featuring the banished Moses in his return to Egypt and the freeing of his people from bondage, certainly has its moments. Most notable is the famous Red Sea sequence. But the pace of the film, which was never all that quick to begin with, really bogs down after a while. Taken as a whole it's a fascinating story. And DeMille spared no expense in making sure that story was brought to life in vibrant, spectacular fashion. As a spectacle it may be a film without peer. You just may be left with the sense that a few trims here and there would have been beneficial in keeping the story moving. But the positives certainly outweigh any negatives. It's a grand film which has stood the test of time.",The Ten Commandments
78,marcin_kukuczka,Cinematic Promised Land of Spectacle and Majesty,9,19 April 2008,"""What love! What a drama! What a story! What majesty!(...)"" proclaimed the theatrical trailers in the mid 1950s when Cecil B DeMille directed his last film, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956) with Charlton Heston. Although it was his remake of the 1923 movie with Theodore Roberts, its content this time was to be entirely set in the famous years of yore when Moses led his people from Egypt to the Promised Land, when the Hand of Almighty God showed great power and when freedom arose among tyrannies of slavery and sin.In spite of the fact that more than 50 years have passed since the premiere of the movie and there have been other ""Moses productions,"" this film still stands out as the most spectacular, respected, visual and memorable biblical production ever made. As an adult now, I often come back in my memory to the days of my late childhood and early youth when I was deeply absorbed by watching THE TEN COMMANDMENTS on TV, usually at Easter time. When I recently came back to it, I realized that it still impresses me. Let me analyze some of its strongest aspects not ignoring possible flaws as well.Firstly, Cecil B DeMille's movie (beside BEN HUR) most clearly resembles one of the key aspects of colossal cinema and ""DeMille's cinema"": HUGE SPECTACLE. This refers both to crowd scenes as well as the depiction of historical period with all its exotic glamor, sets and costumes. The viewer does not have to identify with the characters, does not have to believe in the story or does not have to be any, so to say, ""Bible buff."" Epic productions are characterized by the superiority of the spiritually visual over the spiritually mental. It's enough that there is a spectacle being a real feast for the eye, there are crowds of extras providing the thrilling atmosphere, there are costumes leading to breathtaking moments, there is vivid imagination constituting a journey to the distant past. All this splendor, grandeur, majesty that almost reach the very upright realms of imagination stun the viewers. Among these moments, I should mention the two most unforgettable ones: the parting of the Red Sea and the Sinai sequence when Moses receives the Ten Commandments. Based on Arnold Friberg's 'pre-visualization' paintings, the images beautifully influence one's biblical imagination.Secondly, there are truly outstanding cast. Charlton Heston has become almost 'symbolic' as Moses. His role may be divided into two phases: the Moses before the mission and the Moses whilst the mission. He leaves the Sinai changed, transformed into a prophet, transformed by the very catharsis of seeing the Lord. In the second phase, Charlton Heston resembles the very 'artistic' image of Moses (particularly resembling Michelangelo's sculpture in Rome). This portrayal still appears to many people as the most accurate. He is the awaited deliverer, a leader of mutual freedom into individual freedom. Yul Brynner as Rameses is also unforgettable: not only as far as looks are concerned but also the wonderful depiction of various feelings and desires like pride, anger, jealousy, vanity. He is a ruler and also a leader but, contrarily to Moses, the one of sheer tyranny into decadence, bondage and captivity. Those two different leaders: Moses and Rameses are symbols of the film with parallels to timeless conception and the 20th century, too. Moses leads his people in the glory of God while Rameses gathers his army of chariots shouting ""Death to their God!"" (isn't that exactly what some 20th century philosophers aimed at proclaiming...the death of God?) In between comes a beautiful woman, Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, a sort of Cleopatra and a sort of Poppaea from DeMille's former epics. Yet, she also seems to represent very biblical female characters of luxury and sin like Potiphar's wife, Salome, etc.The supporting cast also do extraordinary jobs. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is very noble in the role of old Pharao Sethi; Vincent Price is Egyptian like as the great architect Baka, Edward G Robinson is very convincing as cruel master Dathan, Nina Foch and Judith Anderson are also given some best parts; Debra Paget is sweet and extraordinarily beautiful as captive Lilia and John Derek charismatic as Joshua.Thirdly, DeMille's film has one more significant feature: real commitment of producers and the director. It is something that modern cinema needs at many levels and should learn from this film. Today, there is a tendency to make films without particular efforts just for money and profit. Yet, film is art and true art always needs effort. This purifying effort and particularly good intentions are still noticeable in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.However, there are people who criticize this movie also posing logical arguments. One of the attacks on THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is that it distorts the biblical events for the sake of spectacle above anything else. It's true that the film, in the first half, concentrates too much on rather detailed and fictitious events in Egypt ignoring the role of Moses on the desert, for instance or the insight into psychological growth of freedom. Another critical view refers to the length of the movie. Indeed, it seems that the storyline based on ancient text and the Holy Scriptures sometimes develops endlessly.Finally, let me quote Nina Foch, the actress who plays Bithia in the film. She often introduced the TV buffs with the Easter screening of the film. She said when asked about the film's test of time: ""It will outlast us all!""THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is, in my opinion, an extraordinary movie, one of the last Cecil B DeMille's symbols, a perfect supply of biblical imagination of grandeur and majesty and a true art of performances. A timeless motion picture!",The Ten Commandments
79,rupie,spectacular example of its type,8,21 January 2000,"It is interesting to compare The Ten Commandments with Spartacus, another historical spectacular made only 4 years later. DeMille's roots in the conventions of 19th century melodrama are clearly evident, while Kubrick looks to Freud, Stanislavsky, and The Method. These sensibilities apply as well to the respective scripts, the language of The Ten Commandments being grounded in a biblically-based floridness, while that of Spartacus is imbued with a grittily contemporary realism. Is one inherently superior to the other? Does a liking for Stravinsky preclude a love of Schubert? Of course not; each can be savored for what it is (though I must admit that the dialogue in 'Commandments' can get ponderously creaky at times).It is difficult, with the passage of the years, not to view Heston's performance as a caricature of itself, but if one can peel back the encrustation of time, there is undeniable power there. Yul Brynner's portrayal of Rameses is delicious (""So let it be written. So let it be done!"") but one does have the nagging suspicion during his scenes that a hoop-skirted Deborah Kerr might appear at any moment. Edward G. Robinson is a tad miscast as Dathan, and one almost expects Vincent Price as Baka to twirl the tips of his villainous mustache, if he had one.Everything is drawn with an unashamedly broad-stroked brush, and it is best just to lean back and enjoy the proceedings in all their quasi-tacky splendor. DeMille obviously had huge fun with the portrayal of the plagues, for instance. The special effects are, unfortunately, sadly dated in many cases (e.g. the fingers of fire writing the tablets, and the parting of the sea) and the portrayal of the debauchery before the golden calf seems to derive from some spinster sunday school teacher's idea of what an orgy must be like (then again, it's a sad commentary on what the decline of standards of screen decency over the years has led us to expect; one shudders to imagine how such a scene would be staged today).At any rate, the movie is definitely a classic of its type and is enjoyable at many levels if you let yourself go.",The Ten Commandments
80,DarthBill,"""Those Who Will Not Live By The Law... Shall DIE By The Law!""",10,7 April 2004,"One of Charlton Heston's finest films. Heston is Moses, the hero of the old testament who leads the Jews out of Egypt, parts the Red Sea, receives God's law and then shatters it when the people p*** him off.
This and ""Ben-Hur"" rank as Charlton's best work, his deep voice, physical stature and strong screen presence perfectly utilized as the film's hero, Moses (of course, he had the perfect costume epic look). Yul Bryner is great as the film's antagonist, and yet he is not a villain himself. Most of the special effects are still good, including the parting of the Red Sea, the writing of the Ten Commandments and the shattering of the Ten Commandments.
Hollywood certainly doesn't make them like this anymore. Amazing how beautiful some of these sets and costumes are, and this was all done back before you could just use computers to fill in everything.

81,gab-14712,A Rousing Epic,9,12 December 2015,"The 1950's was a decade home to many epics. Perhaps one of the best ones produced was 1956's The Ten Commandments. This film fits the definition of an epic very well. It will fill you up with awe, with amazement, and with wonder due to the use of gigantic set pieces, colorful costume designs, a bombastic score, and storytelling that many of us know about (especially if you're from Christianity or Jewish heritage). The film runs at a lengthy three hours and forty minutes, which is common for epics during the golden age of epics. Despite the lengthy film, I felt the movie had a good pace to it. It did not seem like a long movie, and I was almost disappointed when the credits appeared. When that happens in a 3+ hour film, you know you have a good film on your hands.This film is based off historical events or to be more specific, the tale of Moses from his birth to his death. In Ancient Egypt, Pharoah Ramses I decreed all newborn Hebrew males shall die. However, a newborn male named Moses (Charlton Heston) was cast away in the Nile in a reed basket. He was saved by pharaoh's daughter, Bithiah (Nina Foch), and he grew up in court of the pharaoh's brother, Seti (Cedric Hardwicke). Moses made a name to himself and became a favorite to take the throne after Seti. But once Moses's heritage is revealed, everything changes. Moses is cast from Egypt, where he marries and raises a family. He is commanded by God to return to Egypt so he can free the Hebrew people from slavery. However, Seti's son, Rameses (Yul Brynner) does all he can to stop Moses.There are just many scenes in the movies to goggle at. I am very impressed on how the story was told, and I can understand why the movie became a classic. Some of my favorite scenes are the parting of the Red Sea, where Moses splits the Red Sea so his people can cross the sea and be saved from Rameses, who was chasing them down. Another powerful scene I loved was when Yahweh was speaking to Moses on the top of Mount Sinai, issuing Moses the Ten Commandments while all his people were sinning at the base of the mountain. Just seeing God as a ball of fire, speaking with a commanding holy voice gave me the chills. Despite this being a film released in 1956, I believe the special effects hold up fairly well. The parting of the Red Sea is incredible, and it is amazing how that scene was done without the use of any CGI.I have previously reviewed a movie from Cecil B. DeMille, which was released nine years previously in 1947 called Unconquered. That movie showed DeMille had a good hand in making entertaining epics. He really succeeds on the grand scale, as proved by the success of this film. The acting was also consistent and everyone seemed to have a fun time. Sometimes the acting would be downright silly, but there is no denying the fun the cast had. Charlton Heston is no stranger to epics, and I loved his performance here as Moses. Maybe towards the end when he becomes a whole new person he got a little silly, but overall he did a good job. Yul Brynner is good as Moses's fiercest rival, Rameses, He created a memorable villain, who feels betrayed by his father that he would give power to Moses and not him. Anne Baxter does a good job as Nefretiri who was Mose's love interest. Baxter did good, but sometimes her seductiveness would feel out of place in the film. Finally, I must mention Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, the man who was in charge of the slaves. I felt he gave a light, comedic touch to a man in what otherwise would be a sinister character.Overall, The Ten Commandments is a great epic that holds up very well, nearly sixty years after its original release. The film does justice to the story, as told in the Bible. It's obvious the film takes a stance against slavery, and its fun to see Moses outdo Rameses, The special effects are pretty cool, but get ready to be blown away by the Red Sea scene. This sweeping epic is a grand, fun movie. Not only does it enlighten people on the story of Moses and what he did for his people, but it also is fun, silly, and entertaining. The movie does a little into stretching the imagination, but its fun to watch and one of the best epics of all time.My Grade: A",The Ten Commandments
82,harry-76,Food for Thought,3,14 April 2001,"There's no denying the gift of Cecil B. DeMille in fashioning vivid screen entertainment.  That's what most people want, after a hard day's work: something to enjoy and distract the attention from serious contemplation.One might venture a guess that over 95% of viewers of DeMille's remake of his earlier ""The Ten Commandments,"" find this 1956 film just fine, if not outstanding.  It's got seemingly everything needed for great entertainment.  How can anything too harshly be said against it?Amidst the dozens of glowing comments, comes one on the amazon.com site, which states, in part: ""Literal interpretations of mythology like this perpetuate crimes against humanity . . . tell a [fallacy] enough times and people begin to believe it . . . so many actually begin to believe this really happened . . ""This statement emerges like a voice crying in the wilderness; yet it carries implications of depth and wisdom. Here's a viewer who is able to go beyond the crafty showmanship, technical wizardry, and mammoth production values of this product, to discern its essence, and then express his/her feelings honestly.It's a statement worthy of meditation, when one has the willingness to take the time to quiet one's thoughts and focus in on inner harmony.  Granted, it's a challenge, pitted against the sound, fury, and spectacle of this presentation.For those few seeking enhanced awareness, however, it's well worth the effort.",The Ten Commandments
83,RonellSowes,Classic But Histrionic Film,5,22 February 2021,"From prince of Egypt to deliverer of the Hebrew slaves, such was the life of Moses. Most of what this film portrays is drawn from Exodus while some missing pieces of Moses' life are filled in off the judgment of historians. And there's something about Biblical movies that intrinsically makes them susceptible to being rather stagy and Cecil B DeMille isn't the best director to prevent that. Time and time again he constructs a scene that is either too stiff or overdone and is only saved from being completely unwatchable by Elmer Bernstein. Now that doesn't mean DeMille is entirely inept. There's much he does well and if nothing else, making a film of such a colossal scale in that era is a feat in and of itself. But both DeMille and this picture are mixed bags. On one hand you could point out how they recreated ancient Egypt(to the best of their abilities), the memorable quotes and Heston's and Brenner's performances. You could also call out the film's corniness or overtly melodramatic dialouge and scenes that seem to dwell in a realm devoid of subtext and make talented actors look bad.The Ten Commandments is an uneven film with some aspects that have become classics in cinema and others indicative of a hokey, overly long movie. And while the story of Moses and Exodus is a sprawling epic this film didn't have to be as long as it was.
There are scenes that play far too long, others that should be cut entirely and what's worse there are moments when it seems to abruptly skip over important details and leaving you wonder what you missed.
The film alternates throughout between classic and histrionic and one your best off measuring mostly by the merits it has.",The Ten Commandments
84,perfectbond,Simply spectacular,9,15 April 2003,"Since I have recently been reading the Holy Bible with a fine tooth comb, I was eagerly anticipating watching this film on DVD (I hadn't seen it before). I was not disappointed. While revisionist historians have recently questioned the veracity of the Old Testament, I believe the story of Moses was beyond realm of the human mind to invent. While I still believe in them, I am not as sure about the monarchies of David and Solomon. But The Ten Commandments is the story of Moses leading his people, the Hebrews, out of Egypt. The supporting cast, sets, and special effects are spectacular even today. But this film clearly belongs to Yul Brynner's Pharoh and Heston's Moses. Great, 10/10.",The Ten Commandments
85,elvircorhodzic,"""Let my people go!""",8,24 December 2016,"THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is a biblical epic film about human spirit and the freedom of a people, which is inspired by faith in their Maker. This is the biblical story of life of an adopted Egyptian prince and redeemer of the Jewish people from slavery. The film is based on the Book of Exodus. The film was DeMille's last work. It is a partial remake of his 1923 silent film of the same title.The director has tried to present a biblical story through a romantic, moving and visually expensive spectacle. The visual effects are really impressive. Given the duration of the film, it can be concluded that this is the most expensive film to date. Some scenes may be described as legendary. However, this spectacle can act too aggressively for less devout viewers. Given the fact that this drama lacks sincerity, especially in the second part of the film. Some of the special effects are overblown, given that they are signs of God's will.Nevertheless, I am delighted with the scenery and I think the costume is simply amazing.Charlton Heston as Moses is the embodiment of a heroic character that is honest and modest. I thought he was much better accustomed to the role of a young and capable Egyptian prince. His character possesses extraordinary strength of spirit. He is a very good choice for this role, which would later prove to be right in one film from year 1959.Anne Baxter as Nefretiri is a beautiful princess. She is something between the poisonous snake and lovelorn woman. Her appearances are too theatrical. Yul Brynner as Rameses II is quite a tough competitor. He is not presented as the villain. However, his character falls into the trap called the exaggerated melodrama.There are a number of different characters in this film. Edward G. Robinson (Dathan) as a treacherous overlord is the biggest villain in the film. Sir Cedric Hardwicke (Sethi) is a reasonable, good-natured and witty old Pharaoh. Yvonne De Carlo (Sephora) is a shepherdess, Moses's wife and probably the strongest female character in the film. Debra Pegat (Lilia) and John Derek (Joshua) are young Jewish slaves and loving couple who in the general plot are trying to preserve their love. Nina Foch (Bithiah) is an Egyptian princess who, out of love for the ""son"" who was brought up, joins the exodus. Judith Anderson (Memnet) is the designer of the main plot.This is not entirely credible and insightful drama, but it is certainly an exciting movie.",The Ten Commandments
86,jdkraus,Simply a Masterpiece!,10,12 April 2007,"Since seeing it as a boy, ""The Ten Commandments"" was one of the best and most influential epics I've ever seen! After the movie being over 50 years in age, I still considered it as being one of the best and most influential of films. Here's why: The story: Based off of the Holy Scriptures and the other related books, the film bases is about the tale of Moses. The film follows closely (some of it fictionalized), as Moses rises from fame and glory, to exile and hopeless, and to then crossing the path of the spiritual. There he becomes one of ancient history's most inspiring and unforgettable heroes, as he leads his people, the imprisoned Hebrews, to salvation from the grasps of the cruel tyranny of the Egyptians. Supported by the moving narration of Cecil B. Demille, the story flourishes and makes you believe in it.The Acting: Charlton Heston, as the lead, gave a very compelling and believable role as Moses. From his words of cool wisdom, to his thunderous shouts, he is not only a thespian, but a pure image of Moses. In second billing, Yul Brynner is likewise astounding. His performance of Ramses the II was cold, powerful, and unsympathetic to the imprisoned Hebrews.And in addition is Anne Baxter, who plays very, very well as the tempting, seductive, and deceptive Nefeteri. She can either be easily adored, or despised. There are countless other cast members, such as: John Derek, Edward J. Robinson, John Carradine, Sir Edward Hardwicke, any many more faces were all fit and believable in their roles.The Film-making: Till this day, in my mind, it is amazing to watch. From its massive production design (one of the largest recorded in Hollywood history), to the costume designs, the lighting, colorization, and the thousands of extras that floods the picture with an authentic grandeur, it is outstanding. Added to this, the music composed by Elmer Bernstein is pounding and uplifting.Astonishing! Engulfing! Though-provoking! Brilliant! Vivid! Magnitude! I could only praise it, even if it is nearly a four hour film. (for me, the four hours flew by). This is one of the few epic films that follows the three main guidelines needed for an epic on such a grand scale: story, acting, and film-making talent. There's without doubt after seeing this film, your mind will be stuck on it for days.**** out of ****",The Ten Commandments
87,FloatingOpera7,Still The Greatest Bible Epic Of The Silver Screen,10,20 March 2005,"The Ten Commandments was on tonight, as usual around Easter time on Channel 7 ABC. Released in 1956, it ranks as one of the most expensive and ""epic"" movies ever made, right up there with 1939's Gone With The Wind and 1997's Titanic. Charleton Heston, in a defining role that he will be remembered for even after his death, is Moses, looking every bit the Moses of Michelangelo's statue. His dramatic performance is Oscar worthy. Yul Brynner as Ramses, Anne Baxter as Princess Nefertiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Vincent Price as Baka and Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora. A cast of millions, beautiful cinematography, a stilted, high-blown and poetic script (it was taken from two novels) and powerful, climatic music makes this the best film ever made about a biblical subject. While both Christians and Jews can enjoy this film around Easter/Passover time, even people who are not of the Judeo-Christian faith can enjoy the film as a classic work of 50's cinema. It is definitely a movie of its time. In the 50's, television was posing a threat to the film industry, since people were spending more time in front of the seemingly magical new invention at home most evenings and not attending the movies. The Ten Commandments would set a trend of epic films that would carry on till the early 60's- Ben Hur, Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia, etc, in efforts to draw audiences to the movies once more.I don't know if it's the bombastic music, the script, but this movie always gets to me, especially in certain scenes. The most moving scenes for me include: 1)Moses' biological mother Yochabed and the adoptive mother the queen mother Bithia confront...""I gave him life"" says Yochabed. ""I gave him love,"" says the Queen...""when he cried did you comfort him ? When he was hurt did you ache for him ?."" ""Yes,"" says his mother, ""I ached for him."" While a lot of the dialog can seem pretentious, Shakespearean, flowery and uber-poetic (""His name will live beyond the pyramids..etc"" many scenes move you through its sheer drama. It seems old-fashioned now, but back then it packed quite a punch. I also love the scene in which Moses, upon discovering his roots as Hebrew/slave, and openly declares his intentions of freeing them to the Pharaoh in front of the entire court, the Pharao dramatically banishes him from his realm and from history. The Parting of the Red Sea is always intensely moving, as is the scene in which the Pharaoh arms himself and his minions and goes after the slaves. I've always thought that, as long as this movie is, it doesn't satisfy an engaged audience as a ""complete"" movie. Those familiar with Exodus, will realize that in the final portions of the movie, time is fast-forwarded. Directly after Ramses and Nefertiri are defeated (""His God IS God"") the film jumps to the creation of the 10 Commandments and the Calf Worship/Orgy Scene. All this happens rather quickly and then again jumps forward to the time Moses is about to die and ordains Joshua to lead what remains of the Hebrews into the Promised Land. The best part of this movie is not so much the accuracy of biblical narrative (though there is tinkering with the text)but the in-depth, psychological portrait and character development in the characters of Moses, Nefertiri and Ramses. Now, Ramses was a true figure (both in the Bible and in history) but this Nefertiri is a total fabrication. The love triangle was an element used to ""spice up"" an otherwise religious tale. Ramses is possessive of Nefertiri and jealous of Moses' triumphs as Prince and the fact that the old Pharaoh favors him as the next Pharaoh over even his own son. The fact that Moses loves Nefertiri, who is brutally passionate in her love for him (she kills Memnet the handmaiden who breaks the news of Moses' Hebrew origin) adds to the spice. He later loses love for her when he meets with Sephora (Yvonne De Carlo who would later star as Lily Munster from The Munsters in the 60's). Nefertiri, a fine character dramatically-wise, loses her own love for Moses when he spurns her and is even responsible for the death of her first born son. She is so consumed by hatred now that she wants to see Moses blood in Ramses' sword. We know it's on account of the bitterness she feels of being rejected by the man she adored and loved at one time in her life. A great film, and look forward to seeing it next year, next Easter.",The Ten Commandments
88,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,25 October 2020,"At first, the title may seem somewhat uninviting to some people, who may feel that the film is yet another bad production with a religious theme. The theme is religious, yes, but that is not why the film suffers from it. Like other titles in the Epic genre, ""The Ten Commandments"" deals with its plot in a very complete way, adopting different focuses and using different sources for its composition. For the construction of the film's script, historical scriptures of religions such as Islam and Judaism were used, in addition to books by historians and even the works of Philo de Alexandria. All of this done to fill the lost years of Moses' life and make this film work as complete as possible.This story is one of the most famous narratives of all times, the life and trajectory of Moses is told here. Also known as the story of the Prince of Egypt, the plot begins with the pharaoh ordering the murder of all the newborn first-borns, fearing the prophecy that said the liberator from Egypt would be born that day. Leaving his son's future in the hands of fate, Moses' mother puts him to wander the Nile River in a basket. Soon the baby is found by a woman of the Egyptian nobility, who starts to raise the baby as her own.First of all, I must say that the composition of this film is so meticulous and careful that it is extremely difficult not to notice such a characteristic right away. With just a few minutes of film, the super-production aspect that hovers over this work is already evident. Elements such as architecture, number of objects on the screen, number of actors, activities taking place simultaneously and the great performance of the cast, effectively convey this feeling that something colossal is happening before the eyes of the viewer. Each aspect bears great impact on the perception of this giant atmosphere, making the events on screen more than epic.Some scenes even convey this feeling so well that they almost make the whole film count for themselves. Take for example a sequence where at least 1000 people are shown walking together, following the same direction, without using computer graphics or anything like that. In the middle of them you can see carts, birds, pigs, horses, mules, and everything else to transform such a scene into a visual spectacle so splendid and so seldom seen, that make ""The Ten Commandments"" an at least unique experience.Another of the great merits of this feature film, and more specifically of the cast, is being able to make the interpretations match the magnificence of cinematography. Through an extensive repertoire of dialogues, solidly executed by the cast, one can capture the shadow that each of the characters casts on the plot. It is known through the sagacious lines of dialogue exactly who each individual really is, their ambitions, their desires and more than that, what feeling they are transpiring at the moment.Within this cluster of good performances, the interpretations of the two main characters stand out: Moisés (Charlton Heston) and Ramsés (Yul Brynner). At first, we have two individuals from the same creative environment, with a certain similarity to each other, but with clearly different personalities. Throughout the first part of the feature, you can see how slowly the two diverge, gradually moving away from what they once did to the two similar people. And while the film is divided into two parts by an interval, the two characters completely change their known personas. The way in which both actors deal with such a change is extraordinary, because while the personality breakdown is drastic, it does not seem too sudden at any time. This happens through the unusual manipulations of the tone of voice, behavior and speech of the character of Charlton Heston; magnificently contrasted by the stone heart of Ramses, who is increasingly uncomfortable in the face of Moses' advances.In the end, the most expensive film of 1956 has stood the test of time in terms of its colossal atmosphere. The execution of the plot only ends up sinning a little in points that are justified very conveniently, a characteristic that is explained by divine acts or simply because yes. Okay, the religious character supports much of what happens through divine intervention, making the facts more plausible through faith. opposed to the absurdity that is the composition of this feature film. Great interpretations, incredible scenarios, solid execution and an incredible combination of elements is the minimum to be found.I liked this site review Cine GrandioseFilm seen on the 24th to the 25th of October 2020.",The Ten Commandments
89,cariart,It's DeMille...You'll Either Love It or Hate It!,8,3 September 2005,"Cecil B. DeMille was a master showman, rather than a great director, and his 1956 remake of ""The Ten Commandments"" is a whale of a show! Both pious and profane, posturing and sincere, it isn't great history, but it abounds in spectacle. While he was in poor health during the filming (suffering a seizure that was either a stroke or mild heart attack, while working under the 130-degree Eygptian sun), his distinctive 'style' was never more in evidence, with broad, overwrought performances, dazzling costumes and sets, monumental climaxes, and morals that are repeatedly hammered home. In 'classic' DeMille, there ARE no 'grays', everything is 'good' or 'evil', and 'evil' WILL be punished! Watching the film, you'll either enjoy the 'ride', or you'll groan, again and again. Personally, I love it, even with it's unintentional(?) campiness! Among my favorite 'so bad it's FUN' moments are 'Rameses' Yul Brynner and 'Nefretiri' Anne Baxter's frequent use of ""Moses, Moses..."" whenever he predicts something dire (Brynner looks like he can barely keep a straight face, uttering the phrase); 'Sephora' Yvonne De Carlo's stoic, yet impassioned pitch to Moses to marry her, always looking away 'into the future', I presume, when comparing her assets to Nefretiri's; 'Dathan' Edward G. Robinson's entire performance (nearly epic hamminess from one of America's finest film actors); Woody Strode's Ethiopian 'Princess' companion, who praises Moses' kindness with so much heat and honey that Nefretiri suspects he was fooling around, down south; and Sir Cedric Hardwicke's 'Sethi', turning an Eygptian Pharoah into a world-weary lovable executive-type (one can't help but wonder how Rameses could be HIS son!) Compared to Baxter's scenery-chewing, and Brynner's posturing, Charlton Heston's portrayal of Moses is so understated that he's often been criticized as 'wooden' in the role, which is unfair; while DeMille frequently posed him to match classic statues and paintings, his complete earnestness in the role, combined with his sheer physical presence, keeps him from receding into the background of the spectacle that surrounds him. Despite thousands of Eygptian extras portraying Hebrews during the astonishing 'Exodus' sequence, filling the screen, Heston always grabs and holds your attention; certainly no actor has ever been a more memorable Moses! The film has some very obvious merits; many of the special effects (particularly the 'Angel of Death' vapor, and the massive parting of the Red Sea) are still astonishing, today; Elmer Bernstein's score is an often 'over-the-top' joy to listen to; and the cast includes some very entertaining supporting players, including Nina Foch, Vincent Price, and DeMille's longtime associate, Henry Wilcoxon.Taken as spectacle, as a grand entertainment for the senses, ""The Ten Commandments"" is quite a show, and it's continued popularity over the past half-century is proof that many are still captivated by it.Cecil B.

It has the classic big screen splendor that is lacking today, it has the acting like you see far less often, it has location that cgi simply can't reproduce. It is grandeur, plain and simple.The only reason I didn't give it a straight 10 across the board is that archaeologists generally agree that the Hebrews were not quite the slave people as depicted, but more of a contracted work force.

91,beresfordjd,Still does it for me,9,18 April 2006,"Every time it played at our local cinemas I went to see it and sat through it at least twice. I cannot remember how many times I have seen this wonderful movie. I first saw it when I was about 11 and marvelled at it as a spectacle. I wept when Heston wept and rejoiced when he did. As I grew older I came to love Brynner's fantastic performance and lust after Anne Baxter (only better in All About Eve). Cedric Hardwicke, Edward G. and Debra Paget (Hubba Hubba)all impressed me. I was sorry Vincent Price was killed so early - what a great villain. It still demands my attention when it appears on TV. I swear I have seen it enough, but if I catch a glimpse then I have to see it again!! I find it unbelievable that it won almost nothing at the Oscars. At least best Actor for Brynner and best supporting actor for Edward G.!! No costume design? No set design? No Music? A travesty!!

Everything in it is larger than life and over the top, the scope, the acting, the effects, the themes.. well the last one is a given. It manages to make Biblical stories to feel like a fantasy blockbuster, without losing it's themes and meanings! It's never boring or overly preachy, some of the acting is over the top, but it almost has to be. In it's essence it is a story of good vs evil and a great one at that. Charlton Heston's Moses is awe inspiring and cool like Moses always should be. This film inspired Metallica's song ""Creeping death"" that's not what many movies can claim!

93,chaswe-28402,Still incredible,8,14 August 2016,"Overlook the '56 vintage; suspend your disbelief. This is still an achievement worth a watch. Viewing The Ten Commandments back to back with another excursion into ancient Egypt, namely Cleopatra, I was struck by how very much better this one is. Both films are pumped up mammoths, but De Mille pulls it off, where Cleo flounders and sinks. The casting is critical. The American actors easily outdo the British ones, Harrison, Burton and Taylor. Let's face it. Heston is Moses, Brynner is the Pharaoh. All the other men, as well as the women, are excellent impersonations, especially Yvonne de Carlo, even Edward G Robinson, and an unrecognisable Vincent Price. Compared with the spectacular scenes and scenery the script and the plot, although oddly disjointed, seem unimportant.Presumably hardly anyone takes the story seriously these days, but so what ? As filmed, it casts more than half an eye on the American myth, of freedom from harmless old George III, while retaining slavery for Africans, which is muddled and confusing. Never mind. The Egyptians were proto-Darwinians, who saw man as closely related to the animal kingdom. Moses, the Pharaoh for several years, was more of an Egyptian than a Hebrew, who decided to replace the many hybrid animal gods with a single dictatorial sun-god. This incensed the local priests who kicked him out of Egypt, and told him to take his friends with him. They survived, destroyed 6 or 7 other tribes who were living in the surrounding area, and ethnically cleansed them out of the way. Then they invented a lot of miracles and propaganda stories, making them feel good. The feel-good feeling is transmitted by this film, and it sure is impressive and entertaining, even 60 years after it was assembled. I was going to give it 7 stars, but can't really give it less than 8.",The Ten Commandments
94,gsygsy,low priority,2,4 February 2008,"1956 - the year of Rock Around the Clock, Baby Doll, The Girl Can't Help It....and The Ten Commandments. Has it ever been possible to make a convincing, non-comic movie out of a Bible story? Passolini, perhaps, managed it, but I can't instantly think of anyone else. Certainly no Hollywood example springs to mind. They've all been duds. This one is no exception, although the sheer size of it means it fails hugely. While the scale of the endeavour might be commended, and various aspects of the production complimented (the womens' costumes, in particular, contain some excellent designs), the script is abysmal. Actually 'abysmal' doesn't do justice to its awfulness. Dire, dreadful, even unspeakable - but there they all are, those unfortunate performers, speaking it. The actresses come out of this sorry mess with some credit, except for Anne Baxter who is terrible. All the men are terrible except for Edward G Robinson, who rises above the dross to give the only completely credible performance, with Nina Foch, Martha Scott and Yvonne de Carlo in joint second place, the rest of the women sharing third and forth. All the men except Edward G scrabble in the dust, getting nowhere. Any actor, given what Brynner and Heston have to say and do, would find it challenging, to say the least. Perhaps Orson Welles might have gotten away with it, or Olivier, or Brando. But not these guys. Brynner occasionally underplays to momentary effect, but then finds himself forced to register extreme sorrow with a pose that could only have been permitted by a silent film director. Heston is scuppered here, as he was throughout his career, by a complete absence of charm. But then, what charm is possible in a succession of ludicrous wigs? It's very surprising, how little the camera moves. It's this that dates the film more than the process shots - for those you have to make allowances: the effects team did the best it could with the technology available. But the static camera makes the entire thing an illustrated book, or a series of tableaux. This doesn't help the actors, who are left smouldering in shots in a style that we've come to love and mock in TV soap operas. The composition of individual shots, especially with regard to colour contrast, is often impressive, but three hours' worth of film can't be sustained by that. Elmer Bernstein's score is often alluring, though it suffers from the fate of any music in such a movie - too many climaxes. When you've accompanied the parting of the Red Sea, what do you do to when the Ten Commandments are carved into a mountainside by fire? The story of the suffering of the Hebrews in Egypt became, as we all know, a metaphor for many other such oppressions. Verdi turned it into eloquent song, as did the unknown composers of the powerful spirituals which emerged from American cotton and tobacco plantations. The emotion - no - the passion behind those songs and the struggles they represent is rendered completely inert by Cecil B de Mille. His film, whatever his good intentions, is a bloated travesty of everything it aspires to. Ironically, it's worth watching, for that very reason - to see how its windy portentousness continues in the work of the likes of Roland Emmerich, George Lucas and others. But that's not much of a justification for frittering away one's life on Earth. File it under low priority.",The Ten Commandments
95,buccaneer21,Arguably The Best Biblical Film,10,2 November 2019,"Cecil B. DeMille's last film ""The Ten Commandments"" is basically a great Biblical epic that one would still enjoy after 63 years as of 2019 since it has been released in 1956. Why would the viewer?Before we answer the question,let us give a brief background on it.The movie stars Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner. It tells the story of Moses,who delivered the Hebrews from their slavery to Egypt and led them into their journey towards the Promise Land. It tells the story from the birth of Moses until his the time he assigns Joshua to become their new leader before his death.The film has a lot of outstanding qualities that viewers of today appreciates to this day.First,we get to see the story of Moses being told with complete and total clarity that no other Biblical film has ever done in film history.Added to that,we also get to witness great performances especially from Heston and Brynner as Moses and the Pharaoh Rameses respectively especially during their battle. It is also worth mentioning that the other members of the cast did very well. Finally,we also get to see great extravagant movie that people of this day and age would surely appreciate in terms of special effects and technical wizardry despite that it would look dated in this time and age due to the advances of technology of filmmaking. That is why it remains remains popular to this day.",The Ten Commandments
96,peefyn,A monumental achievement,7,6 January 2017,"This is a long film with overly theatrical performances and a story that you know well enough for there to be few surprises. Some of the modifications and additions to the general story of Moses are clichéed and unnecessary. As a story, this movie is not interesting. And the performances are often grand, but foreign to a modern audience, as they're not going for realism.But all of that feels almost like despite the point. This was a huge production of biblical (sorry) proportions. There are huge sets, enormous crowds, huge special effects, heroic stances, amazing locations and a big orchestra soundtrack. There is nothing small about this movie. It was crazy expensive, and the last movie of a Hollywood legend. And the story is one of the oldest ones that we have. Because of all of this, the movie is still more than worth watching, especially if you like film.And there are some things going for it, other than the spectacle. Despite being a long film with a known story, it does manage to hold you through it all. While strange today, some of the performances are quite good, considered what they were going for. It's a joy to hear Heston proclaim ""Let my people go"", and all of the villainous characters are also great fun. It's at times visually stunning, and I would love to see a movie like this in an actual theater. It's also interesting (though not always good) how they have made changes to the story.I can't imagine watching this movie yearly (as many do), but it's a fantastic production, and I wish modern movies could feel as grand as this. The closest thing I can imagine, is the Lord of the Rings trilogy.",The Ten Commandments

99,roghache,Spectacular & impressive epic but not entirely Biblical truth,7,5 April 2006,"I first saw this film at the small town theatre near my rural home when I was but a little girl, such a treat. Of course I've watched it a few times on TV since, and it's always impressive.The movie chronicles the story of the Exodus..from baby Moses' adoption by the Pharaoh's sister...to his realization that he is in fact Hebrew himself and not really Egyptian...to his exile as an adult from Egypt for murder...to his marriage in the desert to a local girl...to his return to Egypt, at God's command, demanding the release of the captive Hebrews...to all the plagues, the Passover, and the massive exodus of the Hebrew slaves from the land of their captivity....to their trials along their journey to the Promised Land and the eventual giving of the Law on Mount Sinai. Charleton Heston is compelling in the role of Moses and Yul Brynner (complete with ponytail) as his opponent, the Pharaoh Rameses II.It's a veritable epic, a spectacle, with dramatic scenes brilliantly capturing Ancient Egypt. Who could fail to be impressed by the Burning Bush, Moses converting his rod into a serpent, the turning of the Nile River into blood, the eerie and dramatic Passover of the Angel of the Lord, the parting of the Red Sea? Amazing effects for that era! My most memorable picture, however, is the lightning like engraving of the Ten Commandments by God on those twin tablets of stone.My only complaint is that the first couple of hours of the movie are basically pure fiction, not Biblical truth at all. To the best of my knowledge, there is no Biblical basis whatsoever for the attraction and romance between Moses and Nefretiri; yet it dominates the entire first portion of the movie. The producers should have cut the film in half and stuck to the facts as presented in Scripture; they're certainly dramatic enough by themselves, without embellishment. Unfortunately, many viewers will probably consider the entire movie pure Scriptural truth.In any case, this is a great mega film. It paints a vivid portrait of the cruel oppression of the Hebrew slaves by their Egyptian masters, the obstinacy of the arrogant Pharaoh's heart, the dramatic plagues, and the mass exodus. Above all, it gives the viewer a sense of the mighty power of a just but loving God and His compassion for His oppressed people. Just don't get your Biblical facts from it.",The Ten Commandments
100,maria2023,The Best Film About Moses And The Ten Commandments,10,10 July 2017,"Cecil B. DeMille made his last film in ""The Ten Commandments"" which was released in 1956. Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner star together with Anne Baxter,Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo,Debra Paget and John Derek.This epic of the film is based on the Bible particularly the Book of Exodus that tells the story of Moses,the Hebrew who was adopted as Egyptian prince who later becomes the leader and deliverer of the Israelites out of slavery from Egypt. This close-to-four hour film starts with the discovery of Moses in the bull rushes as an infant by an Egyptian princess and was later raised as an Egyptian princess.But when he later discovered his true heritage as a Hebrew,he decided to work for the cause of his people.After murdering a slave master,he decided to run away.But years later,he was called upon by God as an instrument to set the Israelites from Egyptian slavery.After he succeeded through the Seven Deadly Plagues,the trip to the Promise Land was told in great detail from crossing of the Red Sea,the journey that was marked by the people's sinfulness,the Ten Commandments, the transfer of leadership from Moses to Joshua, and the arrival to the Promise Land itself with Joshua leading the people.After all this years,it remains the best film ever made about Moses.Many filmmakers have tried to make a film on the same story but nothing could duplicate De Mille's version.It has great production set up,costumes,acting and cinematography.The story was also told in clear detail.That why people continue to see this movie after more than 60 years since it was released. Definitely,it was the best movie about Moses and the Ten Commandments.",The Ten Commandments
101,LivingDog,You sure there weren't twenty?!?,1,14 October 2002,"This movie massacred the story. The story is cut up to suit what was then perceived as ""the way it should have been"" - ridiculous. How can you dare think that you can tell a better story other than the Almighty Lord God!?!? You can't. DeMille turned the Word of God into a soap-opera, and a sappy one at that.Here's how bad DeMille spun the Word: Edward G. Robinson plays an evil guy who tempts everybody into worshiping the golden calf while Moses' brother Aaron stands by in shock and shame at the people's depravity *immediately* after God just freed them from Egypt. In the real account it is Aaron who tells the newly freed Israelites to worship the golden calf!Mr. Robinson was probably caste as the evil-doer because of something Hollowood calls ""star power."" They did this to the Star Wars Pre-quil (it's worth a good sleep) with Samuel L. Jackson. Every time I saw him I thought ""where's Travolta, and why isn't he bustin' a cap?"" So if a movie reminds you of a totally unrelated movie *WHILE* you are watching it, then you know the value of ""star power""!OK Hollywood, here's the ""star power"" formula:interest = 1 / ""star power""^100For you non-scientifically oriented the above formula means that if they ever put a ""star"" in a role to give the movie a ""boost"", then you know the movie is not worth seeing, renting, or even watching when it comes out on the broadcast channels.As far as the acting, production, casting, writing (*sigh* there was writing? the writing credits should have been this: Writing: God), and sundry other things that make a *Hollowood* movie, it all was excellent. So if you're not interested in the Truth, or even the truth (non-believers may also want to see an accurate account of the real story according the the way God wrote the book), then you'll love this movie. It's Hollywood at it's best - which means distorting anything they touch.I'll say this that before I became a believer in Christ I thought that this was one of the all time best movies ever made by an American Master... but since I became a believer in Christ I am very disappointed in the movie. So if you see it as good ""pulp fiction,"" then it is that, and that's all. I tried to re-watch it because it is a good movie, but when I saw the Truth twisted so much I couldn't stomach it.-LDPS: Read the Bible, esp. Psalm 22 :)",The Ten Commandments
102,colewaters,An absolute masterpiece,10,17 April 2020,The Ten Commandments is just not a classic it is an absolute masterpiece. This is one movie that should never be remaked it is just that perfect of a movie.,The Ten Commandments
103,mmallon4,"Old Testament, Real Wrath of God Type Stuff",10,22 March 2015,"Upon viewing with my own eyes Cecil B DeMille's motion picture production of The Ten Commandments, I can only conclude that is cinematic entertainment worthy of the almighty himself and one of which I can wholeheartedly recommend to my fellow man. For man shall be entertained by the will of great cinema, not be the will of inferior productions, for cinema is cinema.Ok, I won't talk like that for the entire review but yes, I love old Hollywood epics. The sheer scope, the bombastic music scores, the rich storytelling, everyone talking like they're Laurence Olivier with everything they say being an epic monologue of well, biblical proportions. You can't get films like this made anymore. No studio would be willing to finance such a project nor would moviegoers be willing to watch a film four hours long; they would run for the hills if you even suggest it to them.From the films I've seen or have tried to watch from Cecil B. DeMille (aside from The Greatest Show on Earth which I also enjoyed) his work comes off to me as dull, turgid experiences. The Ten Commandments is an unashamedly old-fashioned, stagey and creaky film even for its time but that was DeMille's Victorian style. Yet with the Ten Commandments, all these DeMillen elements work; perhaps his entire career was leading up to this one film. The Ten Commandments is one of the most classic of old Hollywood epics tapping in with the public's fascination with Egyptology. No scene during all fours hours of The Ten Commandments feels unneeded, something interesting is always going on with special effects and sets which get better with age; fake but in a good way. Moses parting the sea is one of the greatest and most awe-inspiring special effects shots in cinema history; I can never take my eyes off the screen when it as it occurs.Only a handful of scenes in The Ten Commandments were filmed on location with the majority being filmed within the confines of studio sets. Yet it is impressive how DeMille is able to create such a vast world in spite of this, beaming with life and personality; a lavish ancient Egyptian fantasy land that you can lose yourself in and one which feels lived in. The cuts between location and the Hollywood sets are seamless while the widespread use of blue screen, matte paintings and miniatures help create scenes which look like beautiful paintings. Also keeping with DeMille's Victorian sensibilities, the contemporaneous composer Elmer Bernstein is a surprising choice to compose music for The Ten Commandments but delivers an appropriate, bombastic score complete with horns galore.Everything Charlton Heston says has so much weight to it; his Moses is a superman of whom you would happily follow in a heartbeat and the humanitarian saving grace to the Hebrews when he is still in line to the throne. Yul Brynner, however, is the actor who steals the show; one of the coolest looking stars of the big screen with his distinctive bald look. With his broad and toned figure, no one could look better or strut wearing that Egyptian headdress and attire. Rames is so evil, suave, chauvinistic and charming; at times you love to hate him, at other times you can't help to just love him. This is a man who would do just about anything to attain power and even no has no problem telling his potential future wife she's no better than a dog. Heston and Brynner are opposing forces of masculine badassery with every line of dialogue they utter raising the hairs on my back. - There's no method acting here, it's completely old school theatrics.The Ten Commandments boasts one of the most impressive ensembles casts ever to grace a Hollywood production in which every role feels significant from Edward G Robinson as slimy, cocky, shameless snitch Dathan (no one could pull these traits better than him) to the devilish Vincent Price. The other surprisingly entertaining, campy and sultry performance in the film is Anne Baxter as Nefertiti, of whom I swear has to be a nymphomaniac in the way she swoons and gets excited over the thought of Moses and even getting off on Ramses' insults, not to mention to odd line of innuendo thrown in there (""The very dirty one there. He may serve my purpose""). Likewise, the film's constant use of the word bondage will get some laughs for the more immature viewer.A friend of mine once told me that what prevented him from enjoying The Ten Commandments was that Moses got the easy way out by relying on God's miracles in order to free his people from slavery in instead of political intervention. In reality, without divine intervention, would Moses' best option be to keep his identity a secret and free the slaves once he becomes Pharaoh? Then there's the age-old question, if God is all-powerful, then why does he let bad things happen? Moses asks the film's fire and brimstone representation of God this when he encounters the burning bush but gets no answer. Regardless, such Deus Ex Machina doesn't take away from my enjoyment of The Ten Commandments.I am past the militant atheist phase of my life in which I would have to proclaim my lack of religiosity at any given point and thought I knew better. Regardless of one's faith or lack thereof, stories such as that of the Book of Exodus helped to create the Judeo-Christian values of which define western civilization, in this, a prime variation of the hero's journey. Prior to the opening credits of The Ten Commandments, DeMille gives an opening prologue in which he speaks to the audience in person of how the upcoming story is about ""the birth of freedom"" in which the theme of this picture is ""whether men are to be ruled of God's law, or whether they are to be ruled by the whims of a dictator like Ramses? Are men property of the state or are they free souls under God?"" DeMille concludes stating ""This same battle continues throughout the world today"". Surely it's no coincidence that the final line spoken in The Ten Commandments is Moses proclaiming, ""Go. Proclaim liberty throughout all the lands, unto all the inhabitants thereof"". This was in 1956 when the communist, centralized state society of the USSR was engaged in a cold war with the USA, a country which inalienable rights are endowed by a Creator which government can't supersede. - Yet, this battle of Moses vs. Ramses still continues on the world stage into the 21st century.",The Ten Commandments
104,happipuppi13,The Ten Commandments on Two DVD's,10,29 July 2006,"Like many,I grew up watching (what I could stay awake through)The Ten Commandments every Easter on ABC. It's a bit difficult sitting through a film with so many commercial breaks from 6pm to almost 10:30 at night. Thus,that made it hard to really appreciate the film but I always stuck around for the parting of the Red Sea and the soldiers perishing under it's mighty waves. I also did and still do love it when Moses throws the tablets down onto the golden calf and all mayhem breaks loose for the Hebrews' sinful ways. Last Sunday (7/23/06)I finally watched the film on DVD. This was the 50th anniversary version with 2 discs. Part 2 starting when Moses is to return to Egypt. I can finally say without a doubt this is a very well done film for all it's expense and excess. I know for some it's easy to make fun of the acting or the dialouge (""Moses you wonderful crazy,beautiful fool! ...or such.) Not to mention the very few African's featured in the movie.Egypt being in Africa you'd think there'd be so many more! These things not withstanding,overall the story told here is an excellent one. When one is able to watch the film from beginning to end with only a momentary interruption,then it all comes together in a more satisfying way than when viewed on commercial TV. I finally can appreciate and understand what it's all about and enjoy the above 2 scenes I mentioned even more than before.I would say that if you haven't seen the movie or just not as much,watch it a few times because,there are so many in the cast that sometimes it's hard to keep who's who in check. Someone I watched with actually thought Anne Baxter was the same actress who discovers Moses on the Nile!

105,TheHonestCritic,Is this movie worthy of the Lord himself? Check out my review below to find out!,8,19 September 2020,"""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), this film is definitely a staple in the history of cinema. I used to watch this movie a lot around the holiday season, even though I have never actually sat all the way through it from beginning to end. But, for this review, I finally watched the whole thing and it's definitely worth the time to do that. The only drawback for this movie is the special effects. Of course, there are a lot that still hold up today, but some of them have not aged well. Particularly, a lot of the green-screen shots, blue-screen shots and visual effects have not aged well. A couple of stand out special effects are: the parting of the Red Sea, and also when God writes out the Ten Commandments on the tablets. For 1956, those were startlingly well done and still hold up today! Now, let's get into the positives for this film. This movie has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations and a perfect soundtrack. As I mentioned, this is a retelling of the same story from the original 1923 film, but it's structured so much better and keeps me invested all the way through. That's an impressive feat, giving that this movie is close to four hours in length. It honestly doesn't seem like four hours, you blink and it's over! I still like the story in the 1923 movie, but this one is the true version and it keeps me hooked from beginning to end, which is something that all movies should do. As far as the acting goes, it is nothing short of stellar from all the actors and actresses. The shining star of this film though, has to be Charlton Heston as Moses and the voice of God. He is essentially playing two parts, but he excels at both of them seamlessly. The rest of the actors and actresses are fantastic, and truly compliment his legendary performance! All of the sets/locations are spectacular and give the movie a beautiful atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it sets the tone perfectly for the film and story it tells. ""The Ten Commandments"" is a masterpiece of cinema. Being part Christian, I can definitely relate to this film. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. To end my review of this film, let me share a little bit of history about the making of this movie. It's a remake of the original silent film version of ""The Ten Commandments"" (1923). But, that's not the crazy part about it. Film maker Cecil B. DeMille produced and directed the original film in 1923, and he also produced and directed this remake! Isn't that something? Seriously, how many film makers can claim that? Make an original movie, and then do a remake of your own previous film? That's insane! But, it was definitely worth the extra bit of effort, because this remake is better than the original. If you haven't seen this movie, go watch it. I promise that you'll love it!",The Ten Commandments
106,gpeevers,A True Epic,8,2 April 2019,"This is a true epic in every sense from the subject matter to its running time of 3 hours and 40 minutes. While this is not flawless film it does have many strengths.As Moses Charlton Heston is very effective, although his range may be somewhat limited as an actor this is type of role in which he excelled. Probably the most effective is Yul Brynner as the Pharaoh Rameses. The rest of the allstar cast is largely effective even in those instances where some might question the casting choices. Perhaps most notable and playing against type are Edward G. Robinson, Vincent Price and John Carradine, but there are many other major hollywood stars of the era.Also of note are the special effects, for the era in which this was made they were spectacular, while some of these may look dated now, the parting of the Red Sea remains impressive and powerful.Director Demille may have been a tyrant and his pictures may not have been the most critically acclaimed but he was a Hollywood icon and his epics were certainly very impressive in their grandeur.I believe that whether or not you are religious, or for that matter whatever religion you may espouse, you can still find this impressive storytelling from Hollywood's Golden Age.",The Ten Commandments
107,smakawhat,Yul Brynner IS THE MAN!!!,9,10 June 2000,"What can I say about this classic film.  Ok Heston, he kicks ass and is always great to watch in these old classic films.  The scene where he comes down from the mountain all white haired and bearded has to be one of the great cinema scenes of all time.  Who else could have played Moses??  I can't picture it.  In fact if I ever met Moses I wouldn't doubt for a second that he'd look like Charlie.  So let's even start with some of the other minor players.. Edward G. Robinson as Dathan was real good.  His coniving nature and fox like attitude was just classic.  Vincent Price as Baka the building assistant.  I think this is the first movie I've seen him in during his early career where he wasn't in a horror movie.  He was fantastic even though he was on for only a short time, what an evil dude. Then you have the major players.. Anne Baxter as Nefretiri.  I would have done ANYTHING for this woman!!  She lights up the screen and has such a presence.  She is seductive, sexy, passionate, yet she is also backstabbing and ruthless.  Perfect casting for this role and what a woman!!  Is she ever hot!!  That woman is MINE god damn she is good!! But then... Then.. the person who steals this movie away is Yul.  HE KICKS ASS!! in this film.  He is the MAN the DUDE the POWER behind this film! When he's talking he is the STAR! and NO ONE can overcome him.  Just that glare he gives can only come from a master of stage and screen.  Other stuff... Even the scene where Moses is dying through the dessert and near death, he still manages to kick those guys asses.  Those must have been some powerful dates he ate I bought it totaly.  Seriously I didn't mind it in the film. Criticisms.  Not many I got totaly into it.  The last 20 minutes of the film was a little preachy and long but I guess if they didn't have that then they couldn't call it the 'Ten Commandments' now would they?  It a universal good story regardless of peoples faith. Rating 9 out of 10",The Ten Commandments
108,disinterested_spectator,Improving the Moral Tone of the Bible,7,23 October 2016,"It is interesting to see the ways in which the morally questionable stories in ""Exodus"" are modified in this movie to make them more suitable for a modern audience. For example, the God of ""The Old Testament"" is the God of the Hebrews, who are his chosen people, while the Moses of the movie has a Universalist attitude, saying God is for everyone. Also, there is no indication that the Hebrews were opposed to slavery per se, but only that they did not like being slaves themselves, whereas the Moses of the movie talks as though slavery is intrinsically wrong.And then there is the recurring, exasperating aspect in which the Pharaoh is just about to agree to let the Hebrews go, but then God hardens his heart. Thanks to the addition of Nefretiri, however, the movie is able to blame the woman for hardening Rameses' heart, although Moses does throw in a quick line about how God will work his will through her. But mostly, the movie wants us to blame her. The reason given in ""Exodus"" as to why God kept hardening the heart of the Pharaoh is to make a point:""14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD.""That seems to be acceptable as long as God is just making the lives of the Egyptians miserable, but we start feeling a little queasy when God decides to make his point by killing all of the Egyptians' first born. To render God's behavior more morally acceptable for a modern audience, the movie has Rameses decide to kill all the first born of the Hebrews to show them what's what. In point of fact, there is nothing of that in the ""Bible."" It is God who simply decides to kill all the firstborn Egyptians to really make the point that he is the Lord. But in the movie, once Rameses orders the killing of all the firstborn of the Hebrews, Moses talks as though this has set in motion an opposite process, the killing of all the firstborn Egyptians, almost as if there is a kind of supernatural mechanism that brings this result about automatically.After the death of Rameses' firstborn son, he tells Moses that he and his people can go, taking their belongings and livestock with them. Fine. But then Rameses tosses in a remark from out of left field: ""Take what spoils from Egypt you will, but go."" That's a little bizarre. It is not as though Moses had made that demand previously, as in, ""Let our people go, and throw in all your gold and silver too, or get ready for some plagues."" But having Rameses say this makes it looks as though he offered to let the Hebrews take the gold and silver, that it was decreed by him, rather than the way the ""Bible"" tells it, that the Hebrews accumulated the gold and silver by way of individuals borrowing jewelry in bad faith. It is not enough, however, to have the Hebrews come into possession of the Egyptian gold and silver merely as an instance of ""To the victor belong the spoils."" Rather, the spoils are justified as reparations for slavery.Just as Nefretiri takes the blame for hardening the Pharaoh's heart, Dathan also become the heavy that instigates the building of the Golden Calf. When the Hebrews make it to Mount Sinai, Moses climbs the mountain to talk to God. While he is away, the people begin to think he is never coming back. In ""Exodus 32,"" the people ask Aaron, brother of Moses, to make gods for them, and he complies. He even has all the people get naked and dance around. In the movie, it is Dathan that inspires the people to demand a Golden Calf. Aaron opposes the idea and later protests that the people made him do it. So, the movie eliminates Aaron's complicity.In the category of scenes-we'd-like-to-see, ""Exodus"" tells of how Moses gathered the Levites around them and ordered them slaughter kith and kin:""32:27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.""32:28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.""Ah, what a great spectacle that would have been. But alas, we are unlikely ever to a movie with that scene in it.When we reach the end of the movie, Moses knows he will soon die and that he will not be able to cross the Jordan. Sephora, referred to as ""Zipporah"" in the ""Bible,"" is with him, and this seems strange, because the ""Bible"" seems to say that Moses sent Zipporah and her two sons back home to her father (""Exodus 18""), and that he eventually married an Ethiopian woman (""Numbers 12""). In fact, early in the movie, Moses brings a beautiful Ethiopian princess to Egypt and presents her to the Pharaoh, and for a moment I wondered if she was going to be the one that Moses eventually married. But this second wife has been expunged from the film.On the other hand, some say that Moses had only one wife, that Zipporah was the Ethiopian woman. But that would mean that Zipporah had been black all along, and not just slightly brown. But then, notwithstanding the movie's progressive declaration that all slavery is wrong and that slaves deserve reparations, I suppose depicting Moses as being married to a black woman in 1956 would have been a little too much for the times.",The Ten Commandments
109,cinephile-27690,A Ten For The Ten Commandments!,10,5 April 2020,"I was about 11 years old when I first saw The Ten Commandments. Seeing it on VHS, DVD, and television in a whole decade, I have probably seen this masterpiece 7 times from start to finish, including last night on ABC. With nearly a 4 hour run time, that is quite time consuming, but well worth it.The movie was directed by Cecil B. DeMille, who, in his last and most known movie, uses the Books of Moses in the Bible and historical documents to bring an epic on the story of Moses-how he went from a baby saved from death to the leader of God's chosen people.The movie clearly uses Exodus 1-14, 20, and 32 to tell the story. While other Bible quotes and scenes are used, the Exodus passages are the main focus.However, it is important to note that according to the credits at the start, other historical writings were used, and both Jewish and Christian historians were consulted as well. So, when the movie is not following Scripture, keep in mind that a historical source is being used then.From a visual viewpoint, The Ten Commandments IS visually stunning. From the costumes to the ancient Egyptian buildings and statues, to the effects, it's quite fascinating. Even the Red Sea parting, which looks a little bit dated 64 years later, is still chilling to witness.The acting is on par as well. Moses is famously played by Charlton Heston, in arguably his best role. (I used to say Ben-Hur was best, though I do think his portrayal of Moses is better and more powerful. I can see the argument for either of those movies being better.)Anyways, Yul Brynner is Ramses, who was Pharaoh when the slaves were freed. This is tradition, not Biblical, but it still works for the story. This is most likely done to give him a name instead of just referring to him as Pharaoh. (Fun Fact: Yul was in The King and I the same year as The King of Siam.)I won't take the time to talk about the other actors, but they all do a great job playing their part. Some lines weren't well delivered at times, but the high majority of their work is superb.Despite some minor flaws, as an epic, I consider The Ten Commandments to be a masterpiece. It's been beloved by many for decades, and it's no wonder why. Even my Grandma gave this a 10 when we viewed it last night, and she rarely does that.No matter your religious beliefs, or lack thereof, The Ten Commandments should be considered to be a must see as an epic and a piece of classic cinema. There is enough spectacle and entertainment to more than justify the film taking up 1/6 of your day. For epic film-making and powerful storytelling, thou shalt see The Ten Commandments!Note: Happy Palm Sunday, and I hope all reading this have a great Easter, even in these tough times! :)",The Ten Commandments
110,The_Core,"Epic, bombastic...",8,6 March 2004,"Epic, bombastic and totally over the top... these are the words that come to mind when I think about ""The Ten Commandments.""  With a cast of thousands and lavish, rich set and costume design, this is the epitome of ""hollywood"" pictures.These same qualities turn out to be the film's major strength.  It's pure spectacle on a grand scale, rarely equalled in film history.  Also, I find the score very moving and able to stand alone without the picture.  I like the film ""Titanic"" for some of the same reasons I like this one... as cheesy as it gets at times, there's just something about the scale and scope of an epic that really spins my gears.

Firstly, the story is based on Bible, the classic story of Moses is shown perfectly, tge Moses' story is added by love story of Jeshua, so you have many characters' lines to following. Secondly, the cast is awesome, my favourite is Rameses by Yul Brynner, his performance is the best one. Thirdly, music and costumes create the atmosphere of epic events that happen on your screen.
So, it's one the great film from old days.",The Ten Commandments
112,frank4122,Epic Motion Picture By Which All Others Are Judged,10,16 June 2020,"Cecil B. DeMille's movie of biblical proportions with lavish sets, splendid cinematography and breathtaking scenery is one for the ages. Charlton Heston has exalted the role of Moses in cinematic history. Yul Brynner gave his best performance ever as Rameses. I read that Anne Baxter wanted to change her looks for Nefretiri but I'm glad DeMille won that battle as she looked stunning. As a huge Yvonne De Carlo fan, I love everything she does and she is magnificent as Sephora. As powerful as Pharoah was, he couldn't hold a candle to the great acting of Sir Cedric Hardwicke and a young Debra Paget gives a most spirited and wonderful performance as Lilia. The special effects are outstanding with the greatest one in movie history, the parting of the Red Sea. The greatest actor the world has ever known, Charlton Heston with the greatest director, Cecil B. DeMille were the foundation of the greatest movie, The Ten Commandments!",The Ten Commandments
113,Christopher_Reid,"Big performances, rich sets and costumes, a satisfying epic",8,4 February 2016,"The Ten Commandments has a feeling of profundity to it. The film-makers treat it as a big, sweeping, meaningful story and so it comes across with that tone. I'm not religious but it doesn't really matter, I'm impressed with Moses and his transformation. And I feel humbled when God is on screen (either hearing his rumbling voice or seeing his fire or extraordinary powers) even though I don't really believe in him. Movies ask you to go on a journey with them and plot holes and inconsistencies are less important than a sincere effort to share a vision.The movie deservedly won an Oscar for visual effects. They are dated in many ways but they're still effective. It doesn't have to look real, it just has to be consistent with the world of the movie it's in and take hold of your imagination. The effects are exciting to look at and impressive for the time in which they were made. The stand-out parts would be the parting of the sea which is quite an epic thing to see and when God etches out the 10 commandments in stone using bolts of fire. It made me curious how they did it. In any case, the effects feel big, they're outside in wide open locations. That gives them grandeur.Cecil B. Demille does well at capturing the large sets, costumes and performances. They aren't wasted. However, the movie could have been even greater with bolder direction. He lacks a personal style. The camera rarely moves. There are such powerful tools to be found in using angles, close-ups, long panning shots, contrast between foreground and background objects, shots which suddenly reveal a vast panorama. Creative unexpected ways of filming that heighten emotion or drama. But these aren't used nearly to the degree that they could be. The movie feels a bit safe. I suppose it does give it a kind of neutral sturdiness which suits its grandness and scope.Yul Brynner is commanding as Rameses. He is firm in his beliefs and decisions. He actually comes out likable in many ways because of his consistency. He doesn't appear angry but merely determined to achieve what he thinks is best. He doesn't easily back down and explains why he does things his way. He makes some good points against Moses. He is sceptical about God and Moses' power and that's certainly a healthy sentiment. I liked Anne Baxter as Nefretiri. Perhaps it's an over-the- top performance but it suits this over-the-top movie. You believe in her love of Moses and dislike of Rameses. She seems quite sexual and passionate and she's also very persuasive - she adds a lot of energy to the movie.Charlton Heston gives a dignified performance as Moses. You sense he always cared about the people of Egypt, willing to compromise the system to do the right thing. After he sees God, he's overcome by the need to do God's work. You sense he has become a vessel, he now only cares about being God's hand. There is kindness and poetry and wisdom in the way he then speaks. Overall the script is really interesting with lots of clever lines. Some of it is funny as well. Vincent Price and Edward G. Robinson are also good in their parts.I enjoyed The Ten Commandments for its grand story told in earnest. It spares no expense when it comes to scenery, costumes, visual effects and stars (it was the most expensive film made at the time). The dialogue both sounds like the style of the Bible but also feels modern somehow. So many of the lines have some kind of punch or poison to them.There are flaws in the morality of Moses' journey. God does many questionable things that can't have been the best solution to the problems at hand. There is too much weight given to prophecy and what people say. It's a misconception that something written is somehow more likely to come true. There are times when the message of the film is unclear. The people on the exodus arbitrarily become gluttonous, lustful sinners when Moses is off talking to God for 40 days. Why couldn't he let them know how long he would be or communicate on his progress? Why are the people so sheep-like and 1-dimensional?The Ten Commandments only lacks a few things that prevent it from being great. It doesn't have a gripping emotional climax. Moses changes but he is slave to a force we only indirectly see. He does not have enough moments of humanity or vulnerability. The movie doesn't fully resonate with modern sentiments because the tale deals too much in punishment and revenge. God is presented as a tyrant who causes pain to encourage change rather than simply directly freeing the slaves. And it lacks a style of its own. There are a handful of really cool images but otherwise it looks like Hollywood.Still, it's a big movie and it succeeds in what it tries to do. I enjoyed all of it even if parts of the plot were a bit frustrating. It's a fun, rewarding epic film to watch and it's not every day you get to hear God's voice or see such epic, biblical events happening right in front of your eyes.",The Ten Commandments
114,lyubitelfilmov,The life and deeds of Moses or the Revived Bible on the screen,9,13 June 2021,"Historical drama. An epic film adaptation of the biblical story of the exodus of the Jews from Egypt led by the prophet Moses, which, even in our time, can amaze with its scale. And again I stumbled upon the picture quite by accident when I was studying the cinema of the fifties and sixties of the last century, and I did not see very many screen versions of biblical stories in my life, therefore I decided to fill this gap by watching this epic canvas. And I was completely delighted, and here's my brief opinion - the Revived Bible on the screen. I did not notice the minuses when viewing, but I had some comments that I will highlight in a separate paragraph, but for now, let me focus your attention on the expressive merits of this epic.So, here they are:
1. Scenario - even if you are not a religious person, you at least heard the story of Moses and the exodus of the Jews from Egypt out of your ears, and maybe even watched several of its adaptations, and maybe even read it in the Bible. The script of the picture entirely follows the original source, showing the life of Moses from birth to death. His life, deeds, bad and good deeds, relationships with people around him, his path from the prince of Egypt to the prophet of the Lord, who is entrusted with a great mission. The picture is long, it lasts almost four hours, and this is with an intermission and an overture, but only during this time can this story be told in maximum detail. If you know the original source, then the picture will not be a revelation for you, since in most cases she quotes it verbatim. But you will see the rest!2. Epic scale - the crowd was clearly not spared in order to show the life of Jews in Egypt in all colors. The attitude of the Egyptians towards slaves, living conditions, hard work and the hope of getting rid of all of this are excellently shown. The grandiose festivities of the court of the pharaoh, the way of life, dreams of a great empire, the triumph of victory over neighbors. And in the center of this is Moses - the prince, who did not know that he was the son of a Jewish slave. Well, the very exodus of Jews with the miracles of Moses by the will of the Lord deserves attention. The viewer literally sees that this is a real historical epic, from which it is simply impossible to tear yourself away!3. Costumes, decorations - Ancient Egypt with its majestic buildings that will outlive their creators for many centuries, the Sinai Peninsula with the legendary mountain, on the top of which Moses received the Ten Commandments from the Lord. The exquisite outfits of the Egyptian nobility and warriors, and next to this the most ordinary clothes of the Jews. All this is striking even in our time and makes us respect the work of the creators of the picture, who clearly did not spare the means so that we could contemplate all this beauty on the screen.4. Ten Egyptian executions - this deserves a separate mention, because the picture has graphics, albeit rather primitive, but still. I can't say that all the executions evoke an emotional response from the viewer, except of course the last one (the death of the Egyptian firstborn), but they were put and removed with the highest marks. Finally and irrevocably!5. Actor's game - here without a hat, because the actors really did their best one hundred percent. Of course, I had doubts about Yul Brynner, but they were dispelled within the first thirty minutes, and I did not even doubt Charlton Henson after watching the picture ""Ben Hur"" in 1959, for he deserved my credit of trust. And the rest of the actors tried, not to find fault here!Now for some comments. The opening remarks were somewhat strange and had nothing to do with the events of the picture. What was it for? Some more actions of Moses cause bewilderment and even questions. Although some of this later finds an explanation. And most importantly, sincere sympathy evokes the grief that befell the ordinary people of Egypt during the ten executions. As always, millions are paid for errors of units. It was so in the time of Moses, it is so now, and it will always be so.A little about the main characters:
1. Moses played by Charlton Henson - the found daughter of Pharaoh, who was prophesied the throne of Egypt for his victories and deeds, who found out overnight that he was a Jew and the son of a slave who was to become a prophet of the Lord and lead his people out of Egypt. Throughout the whole picture, we see the transformation of the Egyptian prince and loyal subject of the Pharaoh into the spiritual leader of the Jewish people, who will have to commit considerable atrocities and no small feat in order to save his people. And if at the beginning we see a person who is honest and devoted to his family and country, then after the Burning Bush this is the instrument of the Lord, doing his will, an almost soulless machine, believing in its destiny and ready to fulfill it to the end. And Charlton Henson perfectly coped with the role of this legendary man, whose name is known today! Bravo Charlton!2. Ramses performed by Yul Brynner is the heir of the Pharaoh of Egypt and the named brother of Moses, whom he hates and tries in every possible way to blacken in the eyes of his father. A cunning and cynical politician who, although he gets his own, does not fully understand with what forces he entered into confrontation. Yul Brynner perfectly played Ramses, whom you dislike from the very first appearance in the frame.3. Nefertiti performed by Anne Baxter - the beloved of Moses and the future wife of Ramses, tormented by the throes of love. A cunning and insidious snake that will destroy anyone who gets in its way. And if you anger her, then you will have neither life nor peace until she satisfies her thirst for revenge. Ann here was just amazing!The picture was waiting for a deafening triumph, including the box office, because with its considerable budget, it was able to bring quite a significant profit to the studio, and even earn an Oscar statuette for special effects, which is absolutely deserved! In the Soviet Union, the painting was not purchased for rental, and you understand why. Personally, I didn't give the highest rating just because I liked Ben Hur 1959 more. But believe me, there is no better film adaptation of the story of Moses and will never be. And how miserable against the background of this epic looks the creation of Ridley Scott, who passed in all senses, ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" of 2014. And if you want to watch another version of the life of Moses, then I sincerely recommend the cartoon ""Prince of Egypt"" in 1998.As a result, we have a real epic historical drama about the life and deeds of Moses, with an excellent script, good music, gorgeous special effects, excellent costumes and decorations, and of course with great acting!My rating is 9 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",The Ten Commandments
115,robsta23,"Good, but Long, Anticlimactic",7,4 April 2015,"I am a fan of epics: I love Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia. This epic just doesn't match these two mentioned above. While part 2 is more exciting than part 1, this part of the film also falls short of greatness for me. It is entertaining to see Moses' rebellion, but there are noticeable flaws throughout.It is easy to explain why the first ""half"" of the film falls flat: it primarily consists of very long exposition and a build-up to the second half of the film. The one intriguing moment of the first part of The Ten Commandments is Moses' shift from nobility to a willingness to blend in with his people (who he has just discovered are his people) as a slave. It shows qualities of a great character, but it seems to come across too quickly and without too much thought. Basically, we see only a little bit of motivation behind this very quick change within Moses' ideologies.The second half of the film shows Rameses as really dumb. Seriously, like really dumb. And as a coward, though it is not his acting that shows cowardice, but simply the writing of the film. It makes sense that Rameses is skeptical about Moses' god at first when his men are also able to change their staves into cobras, but you think he would learn by the time Moses claims God will make it hail (and it does) within the film. Nope, he still gives little explanation to why he is skeptical. Then, after agreeing to let Moses and his people go, Rameses seeks after them because it is convenient for the plot for him to become vengeful. He doesn't even get his upcommance of death; he is too much of a coward to travel into the red sea along with his men, yet the actor is so one- dimensional that it never truly comes across as cowardice.The writing is my main problem with this film. The set, the number of extras, the special effects (minus the cartoon fires) are all great and make for an intriguing epic, but this epic is somewhat boring for that which has been described above as well as the ending sequence where there is unstructured ""chaos;"" if the mob mentality was directed as in Metropolis it would have been fine, but the mob behavior at the end of this film seems to just be filmed as if it was b-roll footage.",The Ten Commandments
116,gilleliath,God on the payroll,6,12 April 2020,"Hollywood never could do religious films, because it always has at least one eye on the bottom line. The two leads keep this on the road - just - but it's a long haul. It may have the edge in star power over Ridley Scott's 'Exodus: Gods and Kings', but it suffers in the comparison not only, naturally, from inferior special effects, but from the largely studio-bound production and the uneasy balance between its shallow pietism and a prurient attitude to the imagined delights of the ancient East (a common feature in 50s Biblical pics). And when we see the slaves at work it is, literally, laughable: none of them look like they've done a day's work in their lives, and their disconsolate chopping at bits of straw isn't really a convincing portrayal of oppression.In retrospect what is most interesting about it, maybe, is the preamble in which the film is billed as being about 'the birth of freedom'; not only are the Israelites co-opted as the spiritual ancestors of America, but the Cold War is implied to be a continuation of their struggle. God, guts and guns made America great, folks...",The Ten Commandments

I couldn't tear myself away from it until I had seen it all. Charlton Heston will forever be synonymous with Moses because of this picture. Much of this picture is conjecture since, as stated early in the movie, the Scriptures don't tell many details about Moses's life up until he boldly went to Pharoh and demanded, ""Let my people go."" But it is a gripping picture. I do think, though that this movie should have been titled EXODUS rather than the movie that later bore that title, because it seemed that the part where Moses actually brought down the Ten Commandments from the mountain was glossed over. It seemed as if there was more emphasis on the struggle to bring the Hebrews out of Egypt than on the Ten Commandments. Call it THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, call it EXODUS. Still a gripping picture that everyone should see at least once in their life.",The Ten Commandments
119,Deusvolt,"I found it awesome as a child, mildly interesting as a teener and absolutely nauseating as an adult.",6,28 July 2004,"When I first saw it as a 1st grade elementary schooler, I was thrilled. As it is regularly re-runned during Holy Week in my country (Philippines) I saw it again as a teener and was mildly entertained. As an adult its flaws became all too apparent - the horrendously executed background scenery and the stagey (over)acting by most of the actors. I guess De Mille was too bothered by arthritis to shoot outdoors all the time or on location. But at the very least he should have hired Walt Disney Studios to animate the background scenery. Imagine a Middle East panoramic view behind Moses and his wife and the clouds in the sky are not even moving. Besides, the colors are way off.De Mille played fast and loose with biblical history as he put Josuah on the scene at the beginning of the Exodus. He wasn't even born at that time because remember, the Lord did not want any of the fallen generation to enter the Promised Land. He was a man in his prime when he assumed generalship of the Israelites when they entered Canaan and exterminated native peoples there allegedly at the Lord's command. My own view is that since Exodus was written during the exile when they lived as slaves and hostages in Babylon, the all too human sacred writers sought to instill national pride by embellishments portraying the Israelites as ruthless conquerors in an age when ferocity in battle was much admired. In other words, it was all a PR thing. The film does gross injustice to the Egyptians portraying them as unjust and cruel. The Bible itself disproves this as Egypt has been the traditional refuge for the Israelites in times of hardship as evident in the story of Joseph of the coat of many colors who rose to become grand vizier to the Pharoah. Remember too that the Holy Family fled to Egypt to protect Jesus, the promised Messiah from Herod the Great. And Egypt enjoys favorable mention in God's words: ""From out of Egypt, I have called out my son."" Christians would also do well to ponder on the fact that their religion did not come fully defined into the West whose peoples propagated it worldwide. Much of Christian doctrine was formulated by the early Church Fathers in the Eastern Church where Alexandria (in Egypt) enjoyed prominent place. It was the Council of Nicea that finally clarified for all Christians that Jesus was not only the Son of God but was Himself God. From this proceeded the conclusion that the Blessed Virgin Mary was Theotokos or God-bearer and thus worthy of hyper-veneration among the saints, first practiced by the faithful in Egypt, a surviving remnant we now know as the Copts.A cursory reading of the Egyptians' Book of the Dead and a little common sense would also reveal that much of the Ten Commandments was culled from it. The Egyptians probably adapted much of the Mesopotamians'Code of Hammurabi into their system of morality. Nevertheless, for all we know, nobody copied these notions of morality from anybody. In the computer language easily understood by young people today, it may be that morality is hard wired or programmed into our brains. But in biblical language, we say that God has written His law into our hearts. De Mille also peddled the popular but unproven notion that the Pharoah in Exodus was one of the Ramses kings of Egypt (Ramses II is the more likely candidate as he was the most accomplished in terms of conquests but there is a problem about contemporaneous timelines). As a result, the movie defames not only Ramses II but even his wife, Queen Nefertari about whom history tells us almost nothing except that she was queen. Portraying her as woman scorned, the ex-girlfriend of Moses is really stooping to the pits.In any case, it should be mentioned that the seeds of monotheism was already in Egypt several hundred years before Moses. Pharoah Akenathon believed in one supreme deity whom he identified as Aten, the sun disc. It was not, however, entirely a monotheistic religion as it did not preclude the existence of other gods, only that Aten was supreme. In the same manner, semitic peoples in the Middle East were also not, strictly speaking, monotheistic at the time. Among the Hebrews, YHWH, a tribal God slowly gained ascendancy over the other tribal gods and the ""gods of the high places"" (cf. The Source by James Michener) until worship became exclusive to Him. Allah too was the chief god among the many gods housed in the Kaaba of the Bedouin Arabs in ancient times until Mohammed preached him as the supreme and only deity. In any case, pure polytheism has never been the rule among peoples but rather, henotheism as even among the Greeks and Romans, whom early Christian writers derided as ""pagans,"" had a hierarchy of gods with Zeus/Jupiter viewed as the highest among the Graeco-Romans. But then philosophers such as Aristotle saw the gods as merely agents or representations of a higher ineffable Power. In Hindu philosophy/religion they would be called ""avatars.""Burt Lancaster, in Moses the Lawgiver, did better. And, to think it was just a movie for TV.",The Ten Commandments
120,blue-7,OUTSTANDING DVD COMMENTARY TRACK!,10,19 June 2004,"WHAT does FAMILY PLOT (Alfred Hitchcock), POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (Frank Capra), RICH & FAMOUS (George Cukor), THE LAST TYCOON (Elia Kazan), THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN (George Stevens), A MATTER OF TIME (Vincente Minnelli) and A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG (Charles Chaplin) all have in common with Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS??? Give up? Each listed film represents the final film made by a famous director. Only one of the titles would be considered its directors finest work. Katherine Orrison, Author of WRITTEN IN STONE--MAKING CECIL B. DeMILLE'S EPIC, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, points this out on the commentary track for the Special Collector's Edition of the DVD issued by Paramount Pictures in 2004. Not only is THE TEN COMMANDMENTS considred DeMille's finest film, but it certainly is his most successful from a commercial standpoint. Few, if any other, directors can lay claim to having their final work be considered their best.Katherine Orrison's commentary track is one of the finest every done for a DVD. She knows her subject backwards and forward. For almost four hours she shares fascinating tidbits about the making of the film, pointing out strengths and weaknesses. Orrison has done her homework, seeing the film numerous times with many who worked on the film, including actor and producer Henry Wilcoxon. I thoroughly enjoyed her commentary track and consider it to be one of the finest done for a DVD to date. She discusses why DeMille made changes to the known facts, such as having Moses do his own warnings before Pharaoh instead of have Moses' brother Aaron speak for him as the Bible records. Orrison loves the film and does not mock the Christian principles that it teaches. At one point she comments: ""We don't choose God -- God chooses us."" She believes in God and is thrilled and inspired by what DeMille has brought to the screen. While she points out weaknesses she is quick to praise the magnificence of the over-all effort. She explains that DeMille was very careful to make sure that the film remained suitable for children as well as adults. After sharing 4 hours with Orrison's commentary, I came away with a greater respect for what DeMille has achieved in his final film. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is certainly DeMille's outstanding sound film, while THE KING OF KINGS (1927) telling of the life of Christ is his finest silent film. It would be difficult to say which of the two is his greatest achievement.
After watching and listening to the commentary track, I sent for a copy of Orrison's book (title listed above). The ""Special Collector's DVD"" and her book should make for a great combination in gaining an insight into one of the most fascinating films from this pioneer director. Thanks Paramount for this outstanding DVD edition -- certainly one of your best!",The Ten Commandments
121,etsm92,"""What has been written, what shall be done!""",10,17 April 2006,"The Ten Commandments/1956/****Main Stars: Charlton Heston Yul Brynner Edward G. RobinsonCecil B. DeMille's classic masterpiece The Ten Commandments is the best biblical movie epic of all time. Or at least one of the best. It may not be AMAZING! But it was still EXCELLENT and an awesome and powerful movie epic! I watch it every year when broadcasted on the ABC channel every Easter season. It is usually broadcasted on the eve of Easter just like this year. And yes, I am currently writing this review on April 17, 2006 and yes, Easter Sunday was yesterday but it will be the Easter season through not only April but some of May. So it will not go away for a while. This is a remembered film and a film that will remain a classic. It may have not had the spectacular acting I was waiting for but still the movie I guess would overthrow it with how excellent it was! And the casting was a little off but that's okay because I'm not that type of person that judges the movie on its casting. So what remains is the acting part. Charlton Heston seemed to be the most convincing at the acting playing the deep, booming voiced Moses who will lead the Israelites from Egypt since they were enslaved there. I just love the scene when Moses separates the water to let the Israelites go through while The Pharaoh's (Yul Brynner's) men are trapped behind the fire of God. Then they are able to get through but Moses then has the power to let the water settle back and all the Pharaoh's men drown that were in the water. The Pharaoh is angry and returns back to his queen. Before he shall swipe at her, he has to show Moses' blood on the sword to her. She's disappointed. ""You couldn't even kill him?"" she says in a she-would-probably-be-able-to-do-it-herself voice. Yes, the film seems almost interminable and pretty much wastes your night because the film started at 7:00 p.m. and ended at 11:40 p.m. ABC is probably the worst station to broadcast a movie that long with all their commercials every five seconds. It completely ruins the film. The film is too much of a classic to be interrupted. Obviously ABC cares more about money than anything broadcasting people's commercials that are extremely unnecessary just to get a million dollars even though their company is already billions of dollars worth. They made even more from all the billions of people watching the film in their homes on Easter Eve. So every Easter season I watch more and more of this film more closely just to see what I missed the first times I've seen it. It seems I've missed a lot knowing that I really don't know it all from beginning to end since the commercials get me off track and it is such a long film to remember. One character I do and always will remember is the chubby, annoying gangster Edward G. Robinson playing the nosy, in-your-face Dathan, one of the Pharaoh's assistants. Then there are the women that Moses encounters over the journey through the desert that seem to be all over him and giggling like teenage girls today. Really, I don't think girls were like that BACK THEN. But now they would be. So there are some anachronisms for you. Another anachronism is when Moses is on top of the rock in the village of where the people are worshipping the golden calf. You see him on top of the rock wearing a watch. Okayyyy, I don't think the years before Christ contained market persons selling watches. Really I don't. Maybe it was something that looked like a watch. It looked just like one. You check it out. So, yes the film contains errors here and there as all films do. But look on the entertainment, compelling side. And look at the religious story. It is all very interesting. Look at the acting which wasn't all that spectacular. The film cost a lot to make, no doubt, no doubt AT ALL! The film was fake at parts but hey the year is 1956, what do you expect other than effects that look like they're drawn into the screen or stop motion or even the green screen that wasn't as technological as they are now. The film still was very impressive showing the pure water turn red, hail fall down, locusts around. The conflict between the Pharaoh and Moses and the question that asks what the Pharaoh is going to do and how he will treat Moses when he catches him, if he does at all. Then the story and what is the point? What does this movie tell you? Well, there is a LOT of things going on in the film but the main thing you have to concentrate on is the Israelite slaves being freed from Egypt which Moses obviously does succeed in. The Israelite slaves then act very inappropriately and start worshipping the golden calf idol. Guess who egged them on into doing that? Stupid Dathan, Edward G. Robinson, led them into worshipping it when Moses supposedly wasn't there anymore. No he was on top of Mount Sinai saying to God that he was trying to lead the slaves up to the top of it. God then told him the people are worshipping the golden calf. He then gave Moses the Ten Commandments that will forbid all wrongdoings and sins and tell not of worshipping gold. It instead tells, You will believe in one true God and not have any other gods besides me. Awesome it was! And still that one line stands out at the very end, ""Go!"" says Moses, ""Go and preach to the people and teach them!"" ""WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN, WHAT SHALL BE DONE!"" Movie directed by Cecil B. DeMille.",The Ten Commandments

Based on the story of Moses and the great exodus out of Egypt, it will be remembered as one of few movies that is closest to a true story. Though it probably didn't happen the way it was portrayed in this movie, the events surrounding the events actually happened.Moses is a Hebrew, but doesn't know it. Upon finding out the truth, he leaves Egypt, and tears later, returns to Egypt to ask Remisis, who was a king, or as they call it, a Pharough, to let the Hebrews go. THe Hebres had been slaves for many years, and it was time to let them go. At first, Remisis refused. But then, after his own son dies, he finally lets them go.This movie is very long, but it is worth every minute. My Score: 8/10.",The Ten Commandments
124,TheNabOwnzz,A timeless classic loaded with stunning visuals and beautiful images,9,14 April 2018,"This biblical epic provides a sensational cinematic experience in every sense of the word. With visual effects equalling other classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is an absolute delight to the eyes.A lot of the outdoor scenes have gorgeous backdrops ( A couple of them look somewhat dated, most notably scenes in which animated fire is added. ) but it is an extremely impressive film visually for in the time it was made. A lot of shots in the latter half of the movie feature hundreds of extras flowing across the screen like an epic orchestral piece. There are too many incredible images to name, but the one that stands out is ofcourse the incredible sequence in parting the Red Sea. The entire chariot sequence before that is also beautiful in its cinematography. It is an incredible feast of colour all around. The music by Elmer Bernstein is also an excellent epic orchestral piece and adds to the epic value of the movie.While lacking the emotional value of for example the similar Ben-Hur made three years later also starring Charlton Heston, this does not detract the film from being any less spectacular. This spectacle will constantly fill you with absolute beautiful images and the sheer epic nature of this masterpiece alone will make you lessen the need for an enormous emotional impact.The performances are all incredible too, with Heston in his usual biblical main role giving off an exceptional performance with a lot of character development in his role & Yul Brynner playing the cold and calculating villain as no other.As an atheïst i am not blinded by 'Simplistic christian propaganda' in this film as some say it is full off, but i disagree. It is irrelevant if you are a Christian or not. To see the beauty in this film, all you need is a pair of eyes and the brain to absord it in.All in all, this spectaculair motion picture will leave you in awe and make you feel sorry once more that movies like this aren't being made anymore due to todays social constructs.",The Ten Commandments

As far as the story, I'm no bibical scholar and I imagine this is highly fictionalized, but what a ride!

OK, the special effects were done very well. It's a pity they didn't bring more effort into the rest as well.Everything is just too much staged; the acting, the camera work, the sound... as if I was sitting in the theater. The acting is abominable. The only characters that added at least a bit of spice to their roles were Baxter and Robinson. The rest were just there to overact without making an impression.

I loved watching this as a kid, and even though i'm still quite young, I love watching it, as do my parents. A great movie classic for all. The script was well written, and amazing at how they portray the characters. Pretty sweet movie, I love it. Even if you've read the parts in the bible, you'll still be amazed at the movie and how great it is and how great it must have been in the 50's. Why i liked it pertains to a few reasons, one being that i really like the bible, and if anyone does, I'd recommend watching this one. Great story, flows well, something a whole family can sit down to one evening and watch. I have a wide range for movies, in the classic category, this is one of my favorites.

128,daviddaphneredding,"A wonderful ""Bible-comes-alive"" experience",10,16 May 2012,"This outstanding cinematic experience, which I have seen at least forty times, is one which almost never bores me. This movie, which Cecil B. DeMille wrote, produced, and directed, was his greatest magnus opus or, in Winston Churchhill's words, it was his ""Finest hour"". And there seemed to be a smooth transition on the parts of the cast members into their Biblical counterparts. Charlton Heston typified the strong Moses very well, and Yul Brynner let the world know what a mean ruler the Pharoah was. Anne Baxter helped people to see what type of tempting person the Egyptian queen Nefretiri was. John Derek made a strong Joshua, Debra Paget accomplished a great feat, and Edward G. Robinson, famous for portraying crooks, was the singular actor for Dathan, the ""crook"" a la ca. 1500 B.C. Vincent Price, as Baka, was his usually mean self. Yvonne DeCarlo was a sweet and understanding Zipporah, the wife of Moses. All the actors, again, acted in their parts well. The scenery depicted the topography of that day almost perfectly, and should have, since so much of it was filmed in the Bible lands themselves,(though some were filmed in Hollywood as well.) The parting of the Red Sea was almost lifelike and gave the ""you-are-there"" feeling, something I experienced when I saw the movie fifty-three years ago, as a boy of twelve. Despite the fact that there was a lot of dramatic license taken with the film, it still gave viewers an excellent insight into what the Exodus of Moses and the other Hebrew people must have been like. As a minister I like to see the Bible, again, ""come alive"", and this was the case with this outstanding movie production. All things considered, it was a production almost unequaled anytime in the history of Hollywood. Great!",The Ten Commandments
129,MovieGuyFunTime,Grand Masterpiece of Film Making and Story Telling,10,9 June 2021,"What can be said about The Ten Commandments that hasn't already been said? The story is enthralling; The acting/cast superb; The sets colossal and elaborate and the effects (while dated by today's standards) were mind-blowing at the time and stand up well enough even now so as to not be a detractor.Charlton Heston and Yul Brynner are at their finest and both are simply amazing to watch. Other titans of film include Edward G. Robinson, Vincent Price and John Caradine. While The Ten Commandments is a long movie (with intermission), the pacing and plot developments keep the viewer engaged and enthralled. Even if one is not a devout believer, the story is universal and timeless in its telling of an oppressed class of people subject to the whims of a tyrannical government and their struggle for freedom. It emphasizes the ideal that all men are created equal and no man should be born subject to another. It tells of the power of God's wrath (or Karma) in how those who do evil against their fellow man are repaid with death and destruction.It is one of the greatest stories ever told. Even if one does not appreciate that it is a Biblical story, it still holds to many truths about the struggle of man against man that have endured throughout time. It is Shakespearean in its scale and scope, many complex characters and timeless message. The Ten Commandments is a classic that will endure, not simply because it is a 'Bible story', but because it speaks to the human heart in so many ways.",The Ten Commandments

131,cinemel,"""The 10 Commandments"" is a timeless epic and DeMille's best.",10,27 December 1998,"Cecil B. DeMille's greatest film has stood the test of time. The story of Moses continues to engross audiences in its prime-time TV screenings receiving decent ratings each time it is shown. The film has many great attributes. The performance of Anne Baxter as the Egyptian queen, Nefretiri, is often underrated. Her remarkable beauty, indeed, make her a desirable consort for both Moses and Rameses. The portrayal of Moses' wife, Sephora, by Yvonne DeCarlo was her best performance. Her love scene with Moses in the shadow of Mt. Sinai is one of the more poignant quiet moments in the film. Yul Brynner had his most successful year in films in 1956. He was a superb foil for Moses. He also gave his iconic Oscar-winning  performance as the ruler of Siam in ""The King and I"", as well as his fine Pygmalion to Ingrid Bergman's ""Anastasia"", all in one year.  Listen to Elmer Bernstein's galvanizing musical score. His individual themes for the major characters and epic scenes draw the viewer right into the action. Although ""Commandments"" is best seen on a giant theatre screen, the laserdisc versions are superior visually. The new Dolby Digital soundtrack has its faults, but the use of surround sound during the parting of the Red Sea and the drowning of the Egyptian host is effective. The new animated film version of the story of Moses, Prince of Egypt, owes much to this version of the biblical tale. It also relates at length the apocryphal story of Moses' life in the court of Pharaoh before he came to the realization he was born of Hebrew slaves. ""The Ten Commandments"" was nominated for Best Picture of 1956, but only won the award for Best Special Effects. ""Around the World in 80 Days"" won Best Picture that year. Try to sit through that 3 hour epic on television. ""The Ten Commandments"" will remain in the pantheon of great ancient epics for it tells a timeless story with sweep and emotion that is rarely found in the films of today.",The Ten Commandments
132,maeander,Dated in the 19th Century.,4,5 April 2021,"There's a form of acting called Delsarte. At the beginning of the 20th century it was very popular. Early silent films are a great example. It is superficial, but it tells the audience in a short way what the internal feelings of a character are.It is demonstrative. Many years later the acting was more internal...more subjective...but the Actor's Studio's influence was years away. The acting here is very Delsarte (ex: a hand to the forehead to show despair).At 60+ years this film is an incredible production. It is also stuck in amber. Wooden (almost laughable) performances. Sexist costumes (male and female).The film is very long. The performances are painful at times. The production values are incredible.For all it's earnestness, it is not a very good movie.There are a great many enjoyable movies to watch that were made before 1960. This one in modern terms it does not hold up. But for 1956 it is an incredible production. In film history it is a must watch. In current times, it is only a curiosity.",The Ten Commandments
133,gbrumburgh,"Colossal biblical kitsch, courtesy of Cecil B. DeMille.",8,9 April 2001,"It doesn't get any better than this.  You can count on this perennial favorite to show up every Easter just as you can count on ""A Christmas Carol"" during the yuletide season.  The daddy of all contemporary religious instruction, 1956's ""The Ten Commandments"" is blockbuster spiritual entertainment in every way, shape and form, as Cecil B. DeMille depicts the life of Moses from his birth to slavery to Mt. Sinai in grandiose, reverential style.  And what a life!This was the first movie I ever saw at the drive-in.  I was only 6 at the time but I can remember the neighbors taking me to see this, snuggled up in pajamas and stuffed in the back seat.  The parting of the Red Sea waters, the turning of the staff to a viperous snake, the green-colored pestilence of death seeping into the homes of every first-born, the creation of the tablets, the burning bush, the booming narrative.  I sat in absolute silence and wonderment.  This is my first remembrance of any kind of movie-making and the Oscar-winning visual effects and vivid pageantry are still pretty amazing, even by today's standards.Charlton Heston, the icon of biblical story-telling, still towers over anybody who has ever TRIED to played Moses  before or since.  Stalwart and stoic to a fault, he possess THE look...cut out of pages of my old religious instructions book....the look that radiates magnificence and glory...the look of a man who has definitely seen God.  His commanding stature and voice with its slow, deliberate intonation is eerie and unmatched.  Yul Brynner portrays Ramses II as if he were the King of Siam in Egyptian pants. Nobody poses or plays majestic like Yul.  He's forceful, regal, imperious...everything a  biblical foe should be.  Anne Baxter as the tempting Nefretiri, Queen of Egypt, borders on total camp in her role, her stylized line readings and breathy allure is laughable now, with posturings and reaction shots not seen since Theda Bara.  But who cares?  Baxter provides the most fun and its her florid scenes that I now look most forward to  whether she's throwing herself at the totally disinterested Moses or verbally sparring with Ramses, slyly pushing his emotional buttons.  She alone puts the ""k"" in kitsch.  The rest of the huge cast is appropriately stiff and solemn.DeMille's 1923 original version of ""The Ten Commandments"" is hardly subtle as well, but still impressive and certainly worth a look.  In the 1956 remake, DeMille organizes a cavalcade of thousands to lend authenticity to the massive exodus scenes, while the ultimate picture-perfect frame for me is the three beautiful slave extras posing exotically and dramatically on a rock in front of a vivid blue-gray backdrop of furious, threatening clouds as Moses parts the sea.  That vision alone is one for the books.Whenever I am tempted to break a commandment or embrace that golden calf, I know I'll always have to answer to Charlton  glaring down from Mt. Sinai ready to throw those heavy tablets at me for my transgression.  Charlton not only sets you straight, he makes you BELIEVE!",The Ten Commandments
134,gerry-russell-139,Typical 50s Bible epic but still fun to watch,10,7 February 2002,"Here's a colossal epic with one of the great special effects moments... the parting of the Red Sea. There are some flaws in it however. If you'll notice the water comes so close to Moses and the Hebrews when it closes back in on the Egyptians that they'd get swallowed up as well. The same goes with Yul Brynner on the opposite side of the sea. The point is they should have been positioned back a little further than they were. Aside from that, the story and the acting are still good. The scenes involving Anne Baxter's Nefretiri are some of the best scenes in the film. Being a romantic Nefretiri is determined to make Moses hers and she makes the audience really believe that she'll win his love. But in the end Moses is the out-and-out God follower and chooses glory over sex. Why in the name of God was Edward G. Robinson in this film? That is the only real problem I have with this movie. I hate Robinson enough as it is but then DeMille has to go and put him in an other wise good film and spoil a lot of qualities the film already has to offer. Yvonne DeCarlo as Moses' wife Sephora and Debra Paget as the self-righteous John Derek's love interest are very sweet but DeCarlo is more grounded and believable than Paget's drama queen Lilia. Martha Scott, who would go on to play Charlton Heston's mother in BEN-HUR three years later is his mother in this film too and plays it to the hilt with great emotion. An otherwise unknown actress Olive Deering is Miriam and plays her role in direct parallel to Heston's Moses, hammy and over dramatic. Heston himself has in general only one really strong attribute in this film: his physique. His chest and arms (not to mention his abs) are more in shape and defined better here than they were in BEN-HUR. Yul Brynner as always is in perfect physical shape and plays a tough Pharaoh without any mumbo-jumbo dialogue or any over-the-top gestures . In conclusion, DeMille made an enjoyable film that doesn't drag like most epics do and keeps the cast centered on their parts with a vengeance. He makes them project that they are playing historical individuals that made a difference in history once and can still make a difference today.",The Ten Commandments

Well,they did the best they could. Long patches of stentorian voice-over explaining the story? A feeble crutch for a lousy script. And they can't blame its age, either. Many films made that same year or earlier did a much better job: GWTW, Casablanca, To The Ends of The Earth, the Third Man. But did those films waste as much money? I concur that Chester Moses(Old joke-sorry, I mean Charlton Heston) was at his usual best, but he was a whole lot better in a better film three years later: Ben-Hur. On second viewing, I had a hard time swallowing the inclusion of every Hollywood actor with a pulse being thrown in to play either an Egyptian or a Jew, regardless of the actor's ethnicity or abilities. Heston and Yul Brynner were winners as Moses and Ramses-heck, Yul Brynner was exotic enough to play any race, any age-but there was an awful lot of ""Yondah lies da castle of my fadah""on the soundtrack. Ethnic PC just wasn't the issue in Hollywood that it is now, unfortunately. A lot of reviewers here praise the grandiose spectacle of this film; I think Christian viewers probably love it for presenting a concrete realization of the mysteries of the Bible. I think it would have been a better film if the director had lopped off about 2/3 of the dialog and let the actors put the story across. I mean, could a Hebrew-speaking underclass really be expected to converse at length with Egyptian aristocrats? Very little about this film makes much sense.",The Ten Commandments
136,jmmustchin,Solid Biblical epic,9,1 December 2018,"The Ten Commandments is based on the true story of Moses and the Exodus, as told in the Bible. While there is considerable license, the film is fairly accurate and quite enjoyable. To make it as accurate as possible, the filmmakers consulted many other ancient texts, such as Josephus, Philo, Jasher (which they didn't realise was a 16th-century forgery), and I think perhaps even the Talmud. In doing so (particularly in innocently consulting Pseudo-Jasher), Cecil B DeMille made some errors in the film - but his heart was in the right place in doing so, and I respect his efforts to make the film as historically accurate as possible. There are other accurate historical elements (such as Moses' invasion of Ethiopia) which are put in the film. The film is quite well scripted, and gets the basic story right.The acting is superb. Yul Brynner is definitely the best performer in the film - his portrayal of the stubborn Pharaoh Ramses II is just brilliant. His best performance. Charlton Heston is almost as good as Moses. He's always a good actor, and no less here. His casting did present some accuracy issues (particularly Moses' stutter - in the movie he's a great speaker), but Heston generally nails it. Many people condemn the character of Nefretiri, but I actually think she's one of the more interesting additions. She adds quite an interesting element, and I'm glad they included her. Anne Baxter does a good job in playing her.The special effects in this film are incredible - especially considering the movie's from 1956. Some of the effects are dated, but they generally still awe me today. The best effects scene - in fact, what is possibly the greatest scene in all of cinematic history - is the Red Sea Crossing. It's absolutely epic - sheer cinema at its best.I really like the strong themes of the film - both of freedom and anti-totalitarianism, and that true freedom comes from obeying God's commandments as contained in the Torah (which is summed up in Moses' problematic-for-Christians-who-think-the-Torah-is-done-away-with line ""there is no freedom without the law"".Overall, a great movie.

I'm sure some things could have deleted to make it a more manageable 3hr film. It can be considered a much expanded sound and color remake of DeMille's 1923 silent film of the same title. As some have pointed out, it doesn't always stick to what the bible says, but name me an epic film that always sticks to the facts. He chose Charlton Heston to play the central character of Moses, having had him play the lead male role in his Oscar-winning ""The Greatest Show on Earth"", and seeing in him the likeness of Moses, in a sculpture. As Rameses II, Yul Brenner played probably his second most remembered role, after the king , in ""The King and I"", both released in 1956. Sour-looking Edward G. Robinson was a good choice to play the overseer slave driver Dathan. Yvonne De Carlo had been very disappointed that she wasn't chosen to play Delilah, in DeMille's blockbuster ""Samson and Delilah"". Here, she gets a measure of compensation in playing Moses' wife: Sephora, but I bet she would have rather played the much more glamourous Nefretiri, which went to Anne Baxter. Most agree that Anne gave an exceptional performance, but she was self-conscious that she looked more like her Irish self than an Egyptian queen...........Incidentally, the bible doesn't claim that the Hebrew slaves build the pyramids of Giza, as implied in the film. This claim was first made by the 1st century Jewish historian Josephus, and soon seeped into popular mythology, even today. In fact, the Giza pyramids were built more than 1000 years before the pro-Hebrews might have entered Egypt, and today are believed to have been built by Egyptians, not slaves............. I don't mean to throw cold water on this epic, as depicted, but in recent times, quite a few biblical scholars have found reason to question whether some or any of this story has a historical basis. After all, this scripture wasn't written down until many centuries after the events supposedly happened. Events could have been magnified, altered, forgotten, or added during the oral transmission from generation to generation, or by the scribe who wrote down the story. Unfortunately, the Egyptians weren't interested in writing about foreign slaves. Perhaps the best archeological evidence supporting this story is a short statement on the Egyptian Merneptah Stele, carved not many years after the supposed Exodus took place. It was mainly intended to brag about the Egyptian success in putting down revolts among the Canaanites, who were vassals of Egypt at that time, and supposedly mentions the Israelites, as one of the peoples, assuming the hieroglyphics have been interpreted correctly. .............Among various proposed alternative scenarios, my favorite is that some of these events happened during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaton: the rebel, who ruled around a century before the time assumed in the bible. He was famous for demanding that Egyptians stop calling to the traditional Egyptian gods, and worship only the sun deity Amen-Re(and various spellings). Note that the god's name is the same as the Jewish-established tradition of saying 'amen' after prayers. Mere coincidence? Maybe. ............Sigman Freud, among others, proposed that Moses was an adherent of Akhenaton's, monotheism, whether he was an Egyptian or Semite, and that he led a group fleeing Egypt, into the Sinai when or after Akhenaton was deposed, and the old gods were reestablished, to most Egyptian's relief. In this senario, the Hebrew God Yahweh was a transformed version of Amen, with a different personality, but still almighty. Also, some believe that Set: the Egyptian God of the underworld and evil, was eventually transformed into the name Satan. Ahmed Osman, in ""Moses and Akhenaton"", goes further, in proposing that Moses and Akhenaton were, in fact, the same person, born of an Egyptian father and Semitic mother!!...............Much later, during the late Roman Empire, when Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, he decreed that the sabbath should now be celebrated on Sunday, rather than the traditional Saturday, because, he was used to worshiping the important sun god Sol on that day! Finally, the birth of Christ(as one manifestation of Yahweh, according to Christians) was affixed to near the winter solstice because, this was the time when Sol was thought to be reborn each year, and celebrated. Yes, a number of possible associations, through the centuries, of Yahweh with the sun!",The Ten Commandments
138,Supachewy,A great film about the greatest story ever told,8,19 August 2010,"The epic film The Ten Commandments is directed by the legendary Cecil B. DeMille and stars Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, and Anne Baxter. The film takes place 3,000 years ago in Egypt.The film starts with the pharaoh discovering that an evil star is shining brightly which means that the Hebrew who will save the slaves has been born, so the Pharaoh decrees that every newborn must be killed. A woman named Yochabel sends her newborn son down a river in a basket so that her son will not be killed. The son is then found by the Pharaoh's sister who raises the boy, Moses, as her own son. Many years later Moses is a very successful Prince of Egypt and may even possibly become the next Pharaoh unless his cousin Rameses proves to be the better candidate. A short while later Moses discovers that he is actually a Hebrew and decides to join his people and leave the life of royalty. When the Pharaoh discovers this he outcasts his nephew and that is when the epic tale continues with Moses' meeting with God.The direction of this film was brilliant, DeMille did a great job of making this epic film feel epic. There were many beautiful shots of all the slaves doing construction and especially at the end with the parting of the Red Sea, extremely well done. Whenever God was on the screen the shots for Him were truly Godly and all the special effects for this film were truly magnificent.The acting in this film was only so-so, Charlton Heston gave a very good performance as Moses but Yul Brynner and Anne Baxter were not that great in their parts of Rameses and Nefretiri. For Brynner the whole film he acted the same, angry and cocky. There truly was no emotional change for him until slightly at the very end, but throughout the film his anger should of grown instead of staying consistent. Baxter the whole film was just in love with Moses and didn't ever portray a quality that showed why he was also attracted to her and then at the end I will not give a spoiler away but something bad happens to her and she never shows any sadness, she is just cold.A great part of the film was the score, it really worked well with the film and if one was just hearing it they would know it was for an epic film. It was perfect in all the right places and without it the film would be nowhere near the quality that it currently is.The art direction and costume design for this film was also truly perfect. It is exactly how I imagine Egypt to look in that time period and it was brilliantly done and should be a model for all other films of what great art direction and costume design should be.Overall this film is a solid 8/10, the only thing bringing it down is some of the performances. I would recommend this film to just about everyone, especially fans of the epic genre, and religious and historical films.",The Ten Commandments
139,peapulation,The Greatest Story Ever Told...up to that point,5,25 November 2008,"There are advantages and disadvantages to watching The Ten Commandments today. One advantage is that it's still spectacular to see the great art direction and the effects that were put in in the era that didn't need cgi to be spectacular; hence all the efforts are more appreciated and the plot is more authentic (although Hollywood style). The disadvantage is that, in comparison to Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments has not dated so well.It's still something quite admirable. To direct and manage something as big as this film could not have been an easy task, so what DeMille did is quite extraordinary. And there are some undeniable good things, like Yul Brynner's excellent performance, and, although Heston is not as good as he would have been in Ben-Hur, his Moses pose with his hands spread out is as iconic as anything.The film occasionally pitfalls in the dialog. Epics were hardly admirable for their accessible dialog. But at least in Ben-Hur (I keep referring to that because I believe that is one of the best films ever), there was an attempt to modernize the lines. Here, the screenwriters seem to have been more interested in reproducing more dialog as it'd written in the Bible than help the flow and pace of the film. As well as that, the voice over is simply out of place. Incidentally, because it is a voice-of-God narration, it's also ironically awkward.As well as that, there are some scenes that seen today just look laughable. Like the sequence where Moses has to choose his wife among Jethro's daughters who perform the dance for him. The sequence is quite lengthy, considering that we know he will marry the one who is minding the sheep, because that's the good natured thing to do.Another annoying thing is that the spectacular nature of the film leaves little way for the emotional side of it. The amazing surroundings make it so that there is little time to show the people's struggles. There is too little emphasis on the hatred between Rameses and Moses. In fact, Moses as a whole becomes a trivial character. He is always noble, throughout the film, but his transition from an Egyptian to a Jew is hardly explained. Such a transition should have taken a lot more thought and pondering, and personal conflict. Instead, there just isn't any of that at all. Moses knows what he is to do all along, and as a result, the character of Moses becomes more unbelievable, and we lose contact with him, because he is no longer a human. This may be good in the Bible, but it leaves little for the film.You may argue that DeMille is spectacular, but he comes from an old school directing style that gets in the way of the film's advancement. In this film, as in other ones of his, it is possible to see similarities between his way of working and Griffith's way. The actors are taken care of less, and as a result, the characters appear more distanced.Still, it's a film that should be seen, if not for its meaning, because it really shows what these religious epics were about and why people rushed to see them at the time. Now, the closest we get to that hype is The Passion of the Christ.",The Ten Commandments

The film is also about two hours too long - if you're having problems with insomnia, I suggest watching this film. The director could've worked on authenticity a bit better.

144,joseph952001,Ohhhhhh! Moses! Moses! Moses!,10,23 February 2006,"The Ten Commandments is the most gaudy, over-acted, and funny movie, in places, that was ever made. How in the world could these actors and actresses keep a straight face? I'm sure they with much instinct knew that this could be the biggest all-time bomb ever put on the screen if they didn't play this movie with God-Awful overacting at it's worse, and that's what makes this camp classic so entertaining! And here's Dame Judith Anderson, playing a slave, with an embarrassing look on her face as to how she could ever get conned into playing this role, but who knows, at that time in acting career, maybe she needed the money! One time Hermoni Gingold appeared on the Jack Paar Show on early television, and he asked her what she thought of the first time she pulled into the Harbor and saw our Lady standing in the Harbor, and Ms. Gingold, in her very British accent said, ""Oh! I thought it was just wonderful! But, I could help wonder why they had a statue of Judith Anderson in the Harbor! I have the letter-box version of this film and every time someone appears saying, ""Ohhhh, Moses! Moses! Moses! I expect someone to jump up and shout out JERRY! JERRY! JERRY! But the classic funny scene out of many that no one sees is when Yul Brynner confronts Ann Baxter and tells her EXACTLY what to expect with her being his wife and that he will treat her better than his horses! Insult to injury wouldn't you say? Then he tells her something like this that she will come to him when he wants and that whether she enjoys his love making is no concern of his, but, he adds in an arrogant manner, ""But I think you will!"" And the look on Annie's overacted expression is priceless, and FUNNY! Of course, we all know about Edward G. Robinson being told he's going to go to hell! But, what everyone doesn't seem to see at the end of the film, probably because we're so tired and want this whole nearly four hours of hamming it up to end, anyway, Moses comes down from the mountain and Eddy boy says, ""Here, now! Did you carve those tablets yourself? Moses, you take too much upon yourself!"" And when the Red Sea, which was liquid jello pouring out and then with clever reverse photography got the sea to open, anyway, there are these three maids that look like strippers out of your local strip bar, in a trio with their arms up, wind blowing, trying to protect themselves from heaven knows what! Of course, the music is extravagant and very powerful to match the overacting of its entire cast! And at the end, Charelton Heston in his white wig looking like an ad for Johnson and Johnson surgical cotton supplies, ends the film telling everyone to go into the world and the audience heaves a sign of relief and quickly makes tracks out of Dodge! But, taking everything into account, this movie is very entertaining, and a classic camp romp for everyone in the cast to the over-scored musical soundtrack. With less competent actors, this movie would have flopped on its nose! It's funny how certain lines in movies become famous, even Moses! Moses! Moses! has become as famous as You'll Be Hiss, You'll Be Hiss, You'll be History and Lion's and Tiger's and Bears, in The Wizard of Oz! Great cast! Great music!

It doesn't matter! There are those who accept it on its own terms and revere it, those who relish it as an example of grand scale, baroque movie making, and those who love it for its camp value, as in the early scenes when Brynner and Heston go chest to chest.So whatever your approach, settle in and enjoy.

146,swellframe17,An epic done wrong.,4,23 July 2014,"I understand that it can be hard to judge a film outside of its time. Visual effects, cameras, and acting have come a long way since 1956, but I do not like Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments."" This nearly 4 hour adaptation of the Exodus story has so many faults that are hard to ignore. I'm surprised it is such a classic.I do appreciate this film for how it advanced visual effects for its time. You can tell a lot of work was put into the set and costumes. The film looks good for the most part. However, it's a very slow moving and repetitive story with actors who either show no emotion or who are over the top. The Exodus tale is a very preachy story and this film feels very preachy. DeMille even comes out on screen before it starts and tries to make the story politically relevant. I'll admit that the Exodus tale is not one of my favorite stories and I'm not a religious person. It's a story of my god is better than your god that is unforgiving and DeMille seems to embrace it.Over the course of almost 4 hours, none of the really characters really develop except for Moses. However, Moses changes in a single moment instead of gradually. Charlton Heston isn't necessarily bad as Moses, but I felt like he was just playing himself. Kind of like John Wayne always the same character. All the other actors seem stale and the story takes too long to unfold. I felt like it gets caught up in the visual effects and sets, which hinders the story and characters.If you're a film buff, you should probably watch this movie just to see how innovative the visual effects were. I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone else though. I think Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells' ""The Prince of Egypt"" is a better adaptation of the Exodus story that does it in less than 2 hours. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandment"" is hokey and not thought provoking. It could have been great, but I think it's an epic done wrong.",The Ten Commandments

150,blackasp98,Beautiful every time i see it.,10,13 April 2009,"Since i was a kid, i have seen this film every year with the same result. Awe stricken with the graceful pictures and wonderful story mixed with breath taking special effects. This story of moses was by far the best display of Hollywood magic other than Ben hur. A man born of a slave to be raised by a princess in the house of Egypt to avoid infanticide. Growing up to be a man and finding his roots by happenstance, had become the deliverer of his own people in a few years time from the whips and chains of their task masters to ultimate freedom. Charlton Heston was brilliant as the only man alive other than Jesus who saw the real face of god. And with this new faith went back to Egypt to have his people released from the vile clutches of Ramses. Yet to do this, he had to create a few miracles in that time to give the pharaoh the incentive to do so. But as with all powerful royal mongers he wanted more power, and was keeping the people for his own sake. But with moses the idea of plagues would have done it, but again, with power comes more power so ramses kept the people until his only son was killed from the last plague which ramses gave himself to thwart moses. When this happened of course the people were set free. I loved the way the sets were arranged where we see the people stand in such ways it was like looking at old paintings done by DA vinci or other renaissance painters. The images of miracles happening, and ex slaves watching in horror and awe of the power of god. Brilliant way to show a painting. I cannot understand why anyone would give this film just seven stars. It won numerous Oscars and to me this film will always remain the ultimate classic film.",The Ten Commandments

Even with Edward G Robinson going into ""gangster mode"" while delivering his lines, now and then, I still love this movie...sure, it's Biblically inaccurate, etc. etc. We have the obligatory Hollywood chaste love story between Nefretiri and Moses, plus one triangle with Rameses. Make that TWO triangles, when Sephora enters the picture. And, it turns soap-operaish when the bitchy Nefretiri ends up in forced-marriage to Snidely Whiplash (Rameses). And everyone talks and looks like either an American or a Brit. And, Vincent Price, fine actor that he was, is misplaced as Baca. He's probably too old for the part, even if his great height hints at physical prowess. And, his acting leads us to believe that old Vinny will morph into The Mummy at any moment, wreaking havoc on the Treasure City and making Sethi rue the day he disturbed the tombs of his forefathers!! Still, there's much to like here. I enjoyed Heston's acting in this very much, even tho many people are left cold by his performance. Debra Paget's performance as Lilia is quite fine, too. Some of the sets are so elegantly diginified that I wonder if Anne Baxter (Nefretiri) may have brought in her granddad to design some of them. Yul Brenner delivers a fine performance, too. Many Hollywood guys would have really hammed it up, but Brenner's Rameses always strikes the right note, even if some of his lines are substandard. Anne Baxter is still the star of this movie for me, though, since she's sooooo sexy. I felt I was giving way to a naughty indulgence by falling in lust with Nefretiri while watching a Biblical epic. Her eyes are captivating, her voice lower than Lauren Bacall's, and her movements are like watching a ballerina glide across the stage. Plus, she just wants what she wants, as a spoiled child would. We men in the audience want to give her anything her heart desires. But, alas, that's not to be; she can't marry Moses. We feel bad for the spoiled girl throughout, even when she's fabulously wealthy and Queen of the most powerful nation on earth, maybe because Moses our hero, once loved her. Judith Anderson's Memnet & Cedric Hardwicke's Sethi are SO good, you almost think they're in another film, they so outclass the younger actors. Those old Brit, Shakespeare alumnus guys are still some of the best around. And They Didn't Even Have To Attend The FLAWLESS Actor's Studio!!

Cecille B. DeMille was probably the only director who could have got away with a Biblical epic such as this. The film certainly contains elements that are of a bygone era in filmmaking - the heavy-handed script, overstylized acting, silent-style extra acting, etc. However, the film is overwhelmingly the result of a film pioneers devotion to showmanship that will rarely be equalled in cinematic history. DeMille, was at time, the last of the film pioneers, and he more than anyone, had a sense of how to entertain the public. DeMille can be accused of cheapening the Bible for dramatic effect; but, in the end it is his faith in the storytelling that pulls this off and succeeds on many levels as one of the truly greatest entertainment spectacles in this genre.",The Ten Commandments

The use of colour (or even the lack of it) is very ingenious, the script is intelligent, the acting is excellent, the visual effects are marvellous, the setting is realistic, the score fits excellently and overall it is GREAT.  It was a very intelligent idea not to base the script only on the Holy Scriptures, but also on other novels.  This gave the plot an original story, where everyone knows how it will end, but how this end is reached is a mystery. The love sub-plots are also interesting bringing up such issues as male dominion over slave-girls, forbidden love and marrying for love instead for pro-creation.

And that is what we all ask whenever we see this movie: how did they do it?Watching TTC at the Grauman Chinese Theater, on a big screen and with a few hundred other people, the special effects are really special, especially since this was all done 60+ years ago without any CGI. Yes, as one critic said 60+ years ago in his review of this movie, we are put through DeMille again, but oh what a DeMille!Craig Barron, a visual effects Oscar winner and Ben Burtt, a sound effects Oscar winner, introduced the movie at the TCM 2018 Festival. They brought along some video to explain how DeMille and his team did it - from Pillars of Fire to the parting of the Red Sea. They emphasized that most of the special effects were done in layers, that is, there was more than one element of special effects involved in each special effects scene. For example, the parting of the Red Sea involved a triple matte plus three dimensional sets and special sounds. Even less gaudy effects were multidimensional. When Moses and his wife to be are at the base of Mount Sinai, the Mount is a matte scene but to add depth to it, the smoke surrounding the peak was real, made by special smoke machines.Just as the special effects have taken prominence in this review, so too in the movie. None of the characters is especially intriguing: Charlton Heston (Moses) is just your ordinary born-Jewish-but-left-in-a-basket-in-the-Nile River- to-be-found-by-Pharaoh's daughter-and-made-into-a-prince-of-Egypt.

DeMille knew just how to play the game (and Wood clearly did not), so he was able to splash garbage on the screen and get Hollywood to pat him on the back for doing so. He pandered to the basest instincts of his low-brow middle-American audience and dressed it up with biblical quotations and pretentious promises of moral rectitude. He was basically a con-artist with a camera, a P.T. Barnum let loose in cinema and given the green light by financiers and media mavens - and he got job done for them. 10 Bore-mandments made a ton of bucks, and film critics who should know better continue to sing its praise - Now that's the mark of a truly great con-artist!It was unfortunate for DeMille that he died when he did - he would have made a lot of money as a televangelist.

164,go_titans,Not So Grand,6,23 May 2007,"Boy, this movie seems to be highly over-rated by practically everyone who sees it! I just watched it tonight for the first time and I was quite disappointed. The DVD cover described it as one of the greatest films of all time, so I sat down with this thought in mind. Because of the period in history it represented and the main actor involved I was expecting something on the grand scale of Ben Hur - which I do regard as one of the best films of all time - but instead I found this film to be substandard in several areas. Firstly the acting is melodramatic, and while it appears to be a purposeful style that Cecil has applied, it unfortunately comes off looking too comical to be taken seriously. Anne Baxter was unable to get into the role correctly at all, and she looks and sounds more like she's playing the part of some smug gangster's broad in a 1950's flick starring Humphrey Bogart. The next most irritating aspect was the constant use of a superimposed back drop in scenes clearly performed on stage. Sorry, but I've been spoiled by the wonderful production of Ben Hur, where the only obvious scene using superimposition or models was during the sea battle. Every other part of Ben Hur was done on enormous outdoor sets that were simply breathtaking to behold, where as with the 10 Commandments I found myself constantly listening to studio echo during conversations taking place in a desert setting, or backdrops of massive stone structures that looked too perfect and smooth to be anything other than small scale models. The river scenes suffered from the enclosed feel of a studio in both sound and appearance; Moses stumbling upon a sheep-herding group of beautiful young women was ridiculous (not one of these women was even remotely plain); and the music was totally unsuitable for the period or the importance of the story. I could mention a hundred other things but I'm beginning to feel bad about the negativity of my review. There were things that I did like however. The parting of the ocean was particularly well done, and Moses spewed out classic one liners for the first half of the film like I've never heard anyone do in a movie before. 6 stars, just slightly above average.",The Ten Commandments
165,Marty-G,...and even very much cattle,9,17 April 2000,"So let it be written - so let it be done! This is an all-time classic, which probably deserves more attention that it has got. Yes, it's hammy sometimes, cheezy too, but always good value, the special effects are excellent for its age, and the whole thing has EPIC written all over it. Charlton Heston gives an excellent performance as Moses, Edward G Robinson is suitably nefarious as Dathan, and there's great performances all round from Anne Baxter and Yul Brynner. The expression ""total cinema"" always comes to mind, and it stands up perfectly to repeated viewings... especially around Passover.",The Ten Commandments
166,boomerchinde,A biblical epic or epic proportions as only C B DeMille can do.,5,10 July 2007,"Even when I was a child and saw this movie when it first came out, I was thoroughly disappointed -- the book is much better. Cecil B DeMille's second take of this theme is at least a tad bit less hokey than his first, the silent version, but that isn't saying much. The dialog is terrible, the set design way over the top, and most of the acting is so theatrical as to be laughable. Who can't chuckle when Edward G. Robinson speaks to Moses with his gangster accent? And Ann Baxter is dreadful as she overplays her role, running around crying ""Moses! Moses!"". The saving grace is the performances of the two leads, Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston, who were powerful enough stars to actually keep DeMille from ruining their performances. Lots of stars in this one, and the special effects are all right as far as they could be for 1956. Sorry folks, but just because it was an epic film endeavor by a major Hollywood director and based upon a story from the Bible, this is still a dud. DeMille never learned to let dialog speak for itself, and always had his actors overplay their roles. Still, you need to see it once to satisfy the purists.",The Ten Commandments
167,Jon Kolenchak,More Fun Than It Was Meant To Be,10,20 April 2003,"I was about six years old when I first saw this movie. This was at at time when movies took a long time to make it to television, and the only hope one had of seeing a film again was when (and if) the film was re-released. I remember very vividly how I was caught up the the wonder of it all. Even at that young age, what I remembered most was the music score.When the movie was re-released (before it became an annual television event), the LP of the film score was also reissued. I actually wore out one copy of the album because I listened to it so much.Today, of course, I look at this movie with much different eyes. With all the bad things it has going for it (silent screen-style acting, wretched dialogue, ridiculous casting in the secondary parts, re-writing of traditional notions of Biblical history, etc., etc.) I can't help but say this -- I love this movie! Although I love it for different reasons today.There are so much computer generated special effects in movies nowadays it is almost impossible to understand the impact that this movie had when it was released. And the gargantuan cast -- what other movie can you think of that had so many leading performers of their day (whether you agree with the casting or not)? Hollywood simply could not afford to do this sort of thing today.And there is something else about this film -- under all the glossy spectacle and silliness, I genuinely feel that all the actors were giving a very sincere performance (again, whether you like the performance or not.) I never tire of watching Anne Baxter slither, saunter and strut around the film like a cat in heat. I can't help but think what a good drag queen she would have made, if such things were possible.I highly recommend the DVD print. The movie is absolutely gorgeous, and the sound fantastic.I don't watch The Ten Commandments much these days, perhaps once every 3 or 4 years. However, not too many months go by without me pulling down the soundtrack CD from the shelf and taking it for a spin.",The Ten Commandments
168,metaphor-2,A Wonderful and Terrible Movie,8,22 March 2008,"I have seen this picture many times, including in its original release (when I was 4 years old) but perhaps the most revealing viewing was in the large theater on the Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood. The setting influenced me to look at it not merely as a story, but as a ""production,"" and seen in that light, I was able to understand the conflicts I've always sensed about this film.DeMille was a brilliant producer. He could bring together the film-making elements with a completeness and vision that few could match. He was also a talented visual story-teller. He was also, when this film was made, probably the longest-practicing director in the business, rivaled only (perhaps) by King Vidor. He was the definition of Old School.The film is the most curious amalgam of genuine religious belief and genuine showmanship. He knew the message, and he knew how to get people's attention. He brought the two goals together with the simple arithmetic that is the basis of Hollywood business, and is often the undermining of cinematic chemistry and the undoing of Hollywood art.It must be stated that this film contains a few bits of the most outrageously ridiculous dialogue ever filmed. There is something inherently inappropriate about addressing the giver of the founding laws of Western civilization with the words: ""Moses, you adorable fool, kiss me."" It must also be stated that this film is one of the most awesome and successful acts of film production ever brought off. That was what I realized while watching it within the gates of the Paramount lot. There's a scene where Moses, in his Architect phase, is in his architectural office having a discussion with Nefirtiri. While the two of them work through their frustrated passion, one might notice that in the background, seen through a window, about a half-mile away, 3000 extras are building pyramid. Nobody else made movies quite like DeMille.DeMille keeps this film visually riveting throughout, and it keeps getting better as it goes along. As a visualization of the great biblical story, this is about as good as it gets. If you saw it without being able to understand the dialogue, it would still be enthralling.What ultimately almost wrecks the drama of the film is not the profane ridiculousness of the dialogue or the sexy love-story that seems sacrilegiously embroidered into a holy tale. It is, rather, the genuine piety of the film-maker.The first part of the movie, the story of Moses' search for his real identity and the true meaning of his life, is a great drama. It is well-structured, well acted, and dressed with an inimitable production to give it a sense of reality and greatness. Then, Moses goes up the mountain, listens to the Burning Bush, and comes down gray-haired and radiating divine light.From this point on, Moses has become too holy to suffer any dramatic conflict. As a result, Drama flees from him as though he had some terrifying disease. The movie loses its dramatic center, in the personal sense. The ""drama"" of the Hebrews escape to freedom and their testing and travails is all there, to be sure, but the personal level of drama, which drove the first half of the film, no longer has its central character.The Drama searches for another center to hold onto, but it never really finds one. Pharaoh Rameses makes a good try (and Yul Brynner certainly steals the movie in terms of his performance), but he's not allowed to succeed in becoming the dramatic center because he's the villain. Dathan (Edward G. Robinson almost steals the movie, and would have succeeded if he'd had a larger part) takes a shot at being a dramatic center, but he's not allowed to because he's a secondary villain.As a result, the terms of the film shift completely. The personal drama set against an epic background becomes an Epic without a personality. (And here I use ""epic"" in its true definition, the story of an entire people.) In all, I still think it's a film not to be missed, especially if there's an opportunity to see it on a real movie theater screen. Despite its problems, it's a fabulous experience.",The Ten Commandments

172,happiscotsman,"God said ""Let There Be Light""; Cecil B. said ""Let There Be A Movie!""",6,31 August 2002,"There have been bigger epics (""Heaven's Gate"" and the Russian version of ""War and Peace""); There have been higher awarded epics (""Titanic"", Gone With the Wind"", ""Ben-Hur""); And there have been glossier epics (""Star Wars"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""The Fellowship of the Ring""). But NEVER have I seen a movie that more clearly defines what an epic is. Epics are big, bold, and brassy, and Cecil B. Demille's last film is probably his most magnificent attempt. You want big? Check out the cast! Start with three Oscar winning stars (Charlton Heston, Yul Brenner, and Anne Baxter). Add some of Hollywood's greatest supporting players (Edward G. Robinson, Vincent Price, John Carradine, and Yvonne DeCarlo). And also the only movie I can recall where the cast included both a knight (Sir Cedric Hardwicke) AND a Dame (Judith Anderson). Bold? Look no further than Cecil B. himself. The man lived to make three hour movies. His specialty was directing more masses that any ten directors put together, hence the remark ""I must have killed more men than Cecil B Demille"" in ""Blazing Saddles"". Also the blaring score of the young Elmer Bernstein, who seems to have trumpets blowing every five minutes. Brassy? The special effects  blow away any competition of the 1950's, including ""The War of the Worlds"". The parting of the Red Sea is still Hollywood history, but the writing of the Commandments themselves is also worth viewing. Unfortunately, the beautiful visuals of ""The Prince of Egypt"" have tended to remove some of this movie's shine, but it is still worth the viewing. The dialogue certainly could have been better written in some parts, but Heston still sounds great pronouncing King James' english. Although the movie is mostly about showing off the big budget, the movie's two most moving scenes are when Moses tells Seti off about Egypt's slavery, and the love scene between Moses and Sephorah. When Moses talks of God not wanting slavery ""to be so"", you can feel the conviction of our own nation's transgressions in this matter. The love scene is quite tender and moving as Sephorah tells Moses that true beauty comes from the character within, not the looks without. For us Bible Believers, this is probably as ambitious a visual attempt of scripture as we will get until we see the Bible's characters ""then face to face"".

173,leakhead,the most ingenious film ever,10,2 July 2019,In my opinion the 1956 version of The ten commandments is the best film of all times. It also was the most expensive of its time. The special effects were for that era above spectacular and even today with all the technology it is hard to beat the parting of the sea. The sets were grandiose. The script is extremely well written. The cinematography is superb. The actors were phenomenal in their performance. My wife and I think that the actor that stole the show was Nul Brybber with his masterpiece performance as Rameses The message of hope and the morality arrived by this movie is touching. They don't make movies like this anymore. I think that this movie should have gotten more that just one oscar. My wife and I never get tired of listening to it (we bought the 4k restored version) at least once every second month. I am 60 and I don't think that in my lifetime (for what is left of it) will there be a movie that comes close to it!

174,brendangcarroll,New DVD edition is a disappointment,3,10 May 2006,"Let me begin by saying - I really love this movie - one of the greatest examples of old-style Hollywood film making that there is - and this review pertains ONLY to the new 50th Anniversary DVD.Like many admirers of DeMille, I was delighted when this 50th Anniversary Edition appeared but then, profoundly disappointed with what it contains. This movie has had two previous DVD releases and to my eyes, the presentation here is not an improvement on earlier outings. Unlike Warners magnificent restoration of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, GONE WITH THE WIND and WIZARD OF OZ (among others) which were digitally restored, frame by frame, Paramount has merely assembled the best archive print it can and remixed the soundtrack. As for the ""extras"", surely a film which was in production & pre-production for almost 5 years & cost $13 million to make , had a ton of archive materials - photos, stills, memos, storyboards etc- that could have been included? Check out Disney's SNOW WHITE, or the Special Edition of CITIZEN KANE or the recent, marvellous KING KONG (1933 version) to see how it could have been done! Paramount are cheapskates by comparison.As for the much vaunted 6 part documentary - this seemed very under-produced and cheaply done. Where was Debra Paget? Where was Nina Foch? Where was Yvonne De Carlo? All major players in the film and still very much alive! What great memories they would have had to share! Instead, we get an old, not very interesting interview with Heston (rehashing his oft-told anecdotes) and two minor bit-part players (one, Eugene Mazzola who played Ramses son, offers little as he was only 12 at the time!). And what about Clint Walker? Every time he makes an appearance as a guard (which is often), we are told this by the irritating commentator, as though it was some momentous event - well, if so, why didn't they interview him? He's a nice guy & loves talking about his career. So, Paramount, I am giving the DVD set just 3 stars but only because it is good to finally have the rarely seen silent version available at last. But given the fact that De Mille's own private archive is extensive and comprehensive I am surprised that the De Mille Estate was not more fully involved in this. Of course the movie itself is still astonishing. REAL extras - no computer generated hordes. Full scale sets, costumes to die for, outrageous over the top acting, a full blown score in the Korngold manner, luscious photography with De Mille's remarkable eye for filling the screen with memorable images. How terrific it would be to see the film full restored digitally before its original negatives deteriorate. Will this happen? I doubt it.Three DVDs of one movie in a matter of 8 years seems to me to be milking the cow without any effort and I ask you, how many times will fans buy a DVD of this title? I am wondering - will there be a Super Collectors' Edition next year? If so, I hope it's an improvement on this!A great opportunity missed! Do others agree?",The Ten Commandments
175,vittoriocosanostra,"Gigantic and beauty at the same time, an underrated classic",9,14 July 2020,"Watching a film like The Ten Commandments, which tells a biblical story as beautiful as that of Moses, as great as it is, would need a long and grandiose film, something that was done almost perfectly by Cecil. B deMille.Something that amazes me is how this film is referred to only as one of those long old films, when in fact it is a masterpiece to be seen and reviewed. The entire production of The Ten Commandments, from its absurdly perfect and credible costumes, to the fanciful scenarios that the film takes place. The characters are very well represented, each performance is great and the set is inexplicable. Moisés, Ramsés, Nefertari, Josué ... they are all good characters and are useful in the film, having their peaks, their falls and their outcome. No wonder the film is so long. Talking about the three hours and forty minutes, it passes quickly, like minutes, you don't get tired of watching the movie, even if you don't like it, you are still amazed by the look of the film, the desert scene is an example, as perhaps the best part of your cinematography.But not only that the look of the film is the only point for stand out, because there are many scenes that are successful (The open sea, Moses with the board, the desert scene, etc.) but what surrounds the film in itself. Right at the beginning, we see a small part of Creation, we see Pharaoh giving the order to kill all the Hebrew male firstborn, and we see the ""sacrifice"" that the mother made for her son and the welcome of the Egyptians, but also the confrontation with the truth, and remarkable moments... Acceptance of it, Charlton Heston's interpretation found this.But in general, The Ten Commandments is an excellent film that lives up to the Bible and the story of Moses, it is a powerful, grandiose film that in three hours becomes striking and above all, a classic film. Beautiful visually, and almost flawless in almost everything. Have your flaws? Yes, it does, like every movie. But still, underestimated.

176,dhoffman,De Mille fails again,5,8 March 2001,"De Mille had filmed the story previously in 1923. He failed then too.
Here he has created spectacle for the sake of spectacle and wrapped it in Biblical trimmings.  The sets are great as are the special effects. However, the lines the actors deliver are awkward, stilted, unnatural, and ultimately quite annoying. This is perhaps as unmoving a film as I've ever seen for one with so much passion, tragedy, spirituality, anger, vengeance, love, etc.  All in all, the film is a great emotional void.Sir Cedric Hardwick gives a good effort and manages not to sink beneath the dialogue.  The real performance is from Yvonne DeCarlo who is remarkably subdued and strong in her role as Sephora.  Edward G. Robinson is wasted; Anne Baxter is wasted; Vincent Price is wasted.  John Derek should never have been allowed on the set.  But the greatest mistake in casting is Charlton Heston who plays Charlton Heston. He undergoes a transformation when he sees the burning bush.  He then walks through the role as Charlton Heston delivering lines in stentorian tones. I miss Moses.The Elmer Bernstein score makes for a great soundtrack!

There are a few actors whose first appearances on screen made me laugh out loud (most notably Vincent Price, John Carradine and Edward G. Robinson). For me, the only interesting thing about this film were those few actors who strove mightily to provide some depth to their characters, especially Yul Brynner as Rameses and Anne Baxter as Nefretiri.

179,MISSMOOHERSELF,A Holiday Tradition,10,5 April 2004,"This movie is absolute FUN! I look forward to Easter or, in this case, Palm Sunday and Passover, because I know ABC will air this 4-hour blockbuster (only 3+ hours but ABC has to have its share of commercials) What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the story, some of the truly classic lines and the special effects. The story, as the title implies, is about the 10 commandments -- how Moses received them and what happened to the Hebrews who were enslaved by Egypt. In other words, the Exodus. (If you're looking for accuracy, you won't find it here but the movie is so good it doesn't matter). Some of the classic lines include Ann Baxter as Nefriteri replying, ""I prefer him as a man"" when Sethi says people would prefer Moses as a god. Also, ""I love you. That's the only truth I know,"" she responds when Moses wants to know if she killed the old slave Memnet. And Yul Brynner calling her a ""treacherous, sharp-clawed little peacock"" and telling Nefriteri, ""You're food for the gods and I'm going to have all of you.""  Lines like this are almost laughable and might be edited out of any other movie but for some reason, they fit in this film and they actually add to it.The special effects remain dazzling even in this day and age where you can have an entire movie with no real characters (""Finding Nemo"" comes to mind). I still ask myself ""How'd they DO that"" when I see the famous parting of the Red Sea. Part of me wants to know and yet part of me would be terribly disillusioned if I found out. Even when Moses goes up to the burning bush with short-cropped hair and comes down with a salt-and-pepper lion's mane is amazing. And of course, turning the stick into a cobra and the other plagues that hit Egypt, are also amazing. I could say a lot more about this movie but suffice it to say this really is a terrific film, a lot of fun, a good, old-fashioned epic. It's a Joy to see such wondrous portrayals of Charlton Heston as Moses; John Derek as Joshua; Debra Paget as Lilia; Sir Cedrick Hardwicke as Sethi; Martha Scott as Yoshebel; Nina Foch as Bithia; Dame Judith Anderson as Memnet and, done with such delightful wickedness, Yul Brynner as Ramses; Edward G.

Sure, he's arrogant and bossy, but after all, he was of the royal line of Egypt! In his competition with Moses, he was straightforward, honest, and did not stoop to unfair subterfuge. Why shouldn't he consider Dathan's revelation a valid reason to disqualify Moses from becoming Pharaoh? Even after achieving this victory, and having Moses totally at his mercy, he does not execute his rival, but exiles him, even predicting that he'll forget his troubles with another woman.After several years, Moses shows up again, in total violation of the Pharoah's edict. Ramesses reacts to this with unusual forbearance. He merely smirks, and permits Moses to hang around his court. Moses disrupts the river purification ceremony, but Ramesses prevents anyone from killing him. Moses turns up on a private terrace while Ramesses is trying to read, and instead of having Moses killed, Ramesses merely tries to ignore him and wishes he'd quit bugging him. In fact Moses is attacking his kingdom with multiple supernatural assaults, yet Ramesses tries to shrug it all off as natural events and fails to molest his foster brother, or the Hebrews, until he has endured many provocations. Finally he reaches the reasonable decision to free the slaves, only to be turned from this by the manipulations of Nefretiri, a foolish act of pride and weakness on his part, not of evil. By the way, in the Bible it is God who mysteriously hardens Pharaoh's heart all these times, not Nefretiri.After his plan to kill the Hebrew firstborn backfires, he again decides to free the slaves. The damage to Egypt would have been contained if not for the further scheming of Nefretiri. Of course we know from history that Ramesses II was one of the most successful of all Egyptian pharaohs, and went on to an extraordinarily long and prosperous reign.I am left with the impression that Ramesses regarded Moses with a certain respect. Moses was certainly a more interesting character before his encounter with the Burning Bush. I think if these two guys had ever sat down together without their respective sticks being inserted, they could have worked things out and avoided all kinds of trouble. Of course that might have taken a toll on the movie's dramatic content.",The Ten Commandments
182,rimnod,Thou shalt not consider this movie worthy of a 2nd viewing,5,25 March 2005,"I am sure that I was suitably impressed when I first saw ""The Ten Commandments"" on TV almost 30 years ago. There is no denying that this is a movie of epic size and scope. However, times change and I am no longer the impressionable wunderkind that I was back in 1975. The result is that my middle aged self had a great deal of trouble even making it through THE FIRST HOUR OF FOUR on last Saturday night's showing on ABC. It was rough going from beginning to end and the only thing that kept me awake and alert was my wife's grim insistence and the involuntary giggles that the inanities of the production registered on my weary brain. ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) was Cecil B. DeMille's swan song remake of his silent movie of the same name made in 1923. The only difference being that the 1923 movie has a parallel plot worked into it relating to the present day. The 1956 version is all Old Testament---all the way.I don't have the advantage of having seen this movie on the big screen -- but it's safe to say that the picture has a scale against which all other Hollywood epics are judged. For that reason alone this film is worth viewing once. I would not, however, recommend buying the DVD and running ""The Ten Commandments"" each and every Easter. The straight-jacketed plot and character development become more and more pronounced on each repeat viewing. What's that you say? How dare I offer up plot criticism on the Bible ? What I am referring to here is the license that is granted to anyone making a theatrical representation of a story from the Bible. There is plenty of room for interpretation and translation of the age old biblical themes for modern audiences--- without removing the aura of mystery -the unknowable accepted only by faith. DeMille had an obligation to develop the story and character elements in such a way as to make the plot and people seem understandable (if not totally revelatory) to the modern viewer. In this he failed and I am afraid that this film's absurdities pile up rather fast. Charlton Heston does have the charisma to play Moses. He looks and sounds the part. But he delivers many of his lines with a 500 yard stare and substitutes human emotions for a type of constipated self awareness. Heston's Moses goes through many life changing events during the movie--not the least of which are a couple of one on one pow-wows with the Almighty--however he seems very much the same person from beginning to end.Anne Baxter as Nefertiri possesses a sharp-edged urbanity that does not translate well into a princess of ancient Egypt. Perhaps the kindest thing that can be said of her performance is that she was seriously miscast. I kept expecting her to light up a cigarette or pull a lipstick out of a hidden purse. John Derek does O.K. in the role of Joshua. While it's true that he is every bit as bad an actor as Heston--he at least shows some energy and animation in his role.Yvonne De Carlo hits the marks as Moses' ultra-sturdy wife Sephora. It's remarkable to consider that she would go from this part to playing Lilly Munster on TV less than 8 years later----well...maybe not so remarkable.Cedric Hardwicke (Pharaoh Sethi), Vincent Price (Baka) and John Carradine (Aaron) do journeyman duty---but the acting prizes here go to Yul Brynner as Rameses and Edward G. Robinson as the Hebrew front man Dathan.Brynner exhibits the intensity, pride and overt arrogance that one would expect from an Egyptian prince / Pharaoh. And, if you can get around his trademark gangster-like patter, Edward G. Robinson does well as Dathan - a man forever trying to sell out and exploit his own people. But it is in the way that these two fine acting performances are misused that we find the most pronounced flaws in this film.Of course, Rameses and Dathan are shown to be bad guys. Grant them their evilness and ruthlessness--however DeMille does not prepare us for the suicidal stupidity that he has them exhibit in the second half of the movie... Quite the opposite --they are built up in the first part of the movie as being cagey and very astute manipulators---then we are asked to watch them act like star idiots for the balance of the picture. Shrewd Rameses as portrayed by Brynner should not have called Moses' bluff on the angel of death business and he certainly would not have ordered his army down into the parted Red Sea to attack the fleeing Hebrews. And the ever conniving but eminently practical Dathan would not have tried to undercut Mosesof all people---on the shore of the Red Sea with Pharaoh's army approaching---certainly not after witnessing the plagues that Moses was able to call down on Egypt. When a pillar of fire comes down from the sky to block the army's advance (A pillar of fire!). Edward G. Robinson is forced to deliver one of the most ridiculous lines in the history of cinema as he tries to convince the fleeing Hebrews that their position is hopeless: ""How long do ya a think that fire's gonna hold them ?"".Again, remember  I am not offering a criticism of the Bible story of Moses itself but rather pointing out how badly DeMille failed to produce a coherent rendering of it in this film. In ""The Ten Commandments"" DeMille succeeded only in fashioning an often insipid if mammoth production so honeycombed with senselessness so as to make even an Alabama Supreme Court Justice cough and scratch himself.",The Ten Commandments
183,dcurrie623,A Fan's Notes,10,4 June 2006,"Just to echo the the positive comments posted here. (Pick any of them)If you haven't seen this, where have you been? This is great screen entertainment. 'The kind of movie they don't make any more.'One of the criticisms (by some) is the melodramatic and over-the-top screenplay which, to me, is one of it's enduring assets. It's indicative of DeMille's greatness that he got the script he wanted and the actors who, with the scenery firmly between their teeth, gave it their best shot - and on target all the way. Like many others, I can laugh at some of the dialog when I'm away, but become an avid believer when I view the picture for the umpteenth time. Is this not great Art?Another aspect of the picture I noticed (after an embarrassing number of viewings), is that each shot is staged like a Silent Movie. It's none the worse for that as in every respect it is a modern (or at least a 1956 modern) movie. But it's staging might be one of the subconscious contributions to it's timelessness.Along with the above, notice how few close-ups there are. When DeMille has a close-up it means something and advances the plot. Contemporary film-makers take note!Also these days we hear a lot about 'ensemble' acting. I guess that means there are more than three people with five or more lines that are involved in the plot and appear together in a few scenes. This is one of many examples of DeMille's penchant for 'ensemble' acting. And with this high-powered cast, ensemble par excellence.One of the things I didn't notice until later, was that the film was pretty much shot in the studio. The memorable vistas of the Exodus, the ""Treasure City"" of Seti, and Moses' exile don't take up that much screen time. This is a tribute both to DeMille's storytelling ability (keeping our mind on the subject at hand) and the excellent Art Direction and Set Decoration of Paramount Pictures (I don't think they won any Oscars either). Yet there is never a studio-bound feeling on the part of the viewer. Great cinematic Art indeed. If this story takes place in Ancient Egypt, by God we're going to see Ancient Egypt. And we do.The story, concept and execution are so Big, that one does not notice that on the big screen the aspect ratio is around 1:1.85. The advantage is there is little or nothing lost on the TV screen. In fact when I saw this after a long while in a movie theater, I only briefly noted that it wasn't as wide as I had expected. If you get a chance to see this in a movie theater - Go.Finally the biggest tribute I can make to this great picture is that it was Charlton Heston's 'Finest Hour'.",The Ten Commandments
184,daleja-dale,Ten Stars for The Ten Commandments,10,6 May 2011,"This is a movie that seems to get better and better every time I watch it! The acting performances by Charlston Heston, Yule Brinner, Anne Baxter, Master of the Macabre Vincent Price, Edward G. Robinson, and many others, the cinematography, the special effects, narration, and the fantastic music sound track made this an extraordinary classic movie! But best of all, this film glorifies God more than any film I have ever seen! It portrays God as sovereign,holy, all powerful, majestic, etc.! This movie does however has some flaws in it! For example, some of the characters in it don't every age and what is typical of films made in the 30s, 40s, and 50s, blacks had no major role in the film, even though Egyptians and Hebrews were generally black or at less mix black during ancient times! But bottom line, these cons are easily over shadowed by the greatness of its pros! I still give it 10 out of 10 stars!",The Ten Commandments
185,sailor-mac-43282,These Performers Are The Ultimate Easter Hams!,9,5 April 2021,"Okay, so this is a massive pile of ham and cheese. The acting is from the William Shatner school of over-the-top. The dialogue is ridiculously bombastic - every line meant to be casual conversation sounds like the climax of somebody's campaign speech. The special effects are full of REALLY obvious rear projections. The narrator scolds the participants in the Golden Calf revel for being HORRIBLE SINNERS - while the camera lovingly captures every bit of their sin. And yet, I watch the damn thing on TV every single year - because it's FUN. Its very silliness makes it endearing. It would make for a great evening of Mystery Science Theater 3000-type riffing with like-minded friends - there is PLENTY here to have fun with. (Every year seems to provide more riffing opportunities - how much humor is there in the fact that a woman who gives a big, windy speech about how she is free of makeup and moisturizers is named SEPHORA?) They would definitely never be able to make this movie today - Biblical epics have gone the way of Sunday school for kids, and this style of acting would be laughed off the screen. But I'm glad the '50s coughed this up, in all its bloated, gaudy glory. It's as much a part of my Easter as Cadbury Creme Eggs.",The Ten Commandments
186,dudleynomore,The religious movie even an atheist can love,10,19 March 2006,"Obvious words of warning apply: this movie almost certainly bears as much resemblance to anything that actually happened as THE LORD OF THE RINGS does to the history of Western Europe. The glory of this film is the way the primary-colour costumes, huge sets, magnificently portentous (but often very poetic and witty) dialogue, the special effects and the acting, manage to make believing in God seem like so much *FUN* that even I, as a Proper Atheist, finished up thinking ""wow, the Bible sure has some pretty great stories in it"". Note also how Mose's change from concerned member of the nobility to instrument of The Lord is traced with proper attention to every stage of the transformation  until the burning bush, he's always the cautious skeptic who wants to believe, but follows the path of righteousness from the conscious choice of his heart rather than through blind religious zeal. It makes his emergence as Gandalf the White in the second half seem *so* much more earned, that I found I could cheer wholeheartedly for a character which might easily have felt two-dimensional.This film is a better advert for Christianity than a thousand dry-as-dust Sunday School lessons. THE PASSION OF THE Christ (which, don't get me wrong, was a decent retelling of the last day of Jesus and much more 'realist' than this) doesn't come close.",The Ten Commandments
187,michaeljacobs,About as true to The Book as an episode of the Simpsons...,5,26 December 2004,"I watched with increasing disbelief as the narrative invented entire portions of the life of Moses, whilst distorting the Biblical story almost beyond recognition.Why waste more than 30 minutes on invented back-story when the time would have been better spent on the Plagues, or the revelation at Mt. Sinai? Cecil B. de Mille probably didn't read the original before making this film, and it shows. Nice performances by Yul Brynner and Charlton Heston at times, and the best parts are certainly the plagues: the darkness and the Death of the Firstborn being the most effective. In truth, Pharoah's own magicians would have made better FX than Hollywood, since Egypt was to magic and sorcery what Broadway is to Musicals. Talking of which, I think that what I have seen of Dreamworks' ""Prince of Egypt"" did the Biblical epic more justice. So let it be written, so let it be done!",The Ten Commandments

189,jortegasa,Let my people go,7,7 June 2019,"So I am going to be up front here about how I felt before I even started to watch this Charlton Heston yarn. My eyes had started to roll before it even started. I would not stay I'm over religious at all, I have more hope for an afterlife then I do belief in one, but this is one of the great in all cinema and I felt that I needed to give it a chance. And I did. Want to know something? My eyes ended up rolling back to where they belong and while I did not love it, I would say that I liked it enough that I would watch it again. Giving a movie speak for itself is important, never should you knock something down until you have witnessed it with your own eyeballs.So I do not need to go into very much detail here on what the story is. It is one that most of us have heard of in one form or another, be it by reading it in the Bible or by seeing a disney movie. Maybe this is where my indifference had started but it did get stuck in my mind, its going to be an almost four hour bible lecture. But the basic story is Heston is a Jewish baby that is found by the sister of the pharaoh and raised as one of their own. Yul Brynner finds out the truth and pretty soon Heston is leading his people to find a home of their own.What I enjoyed the most is that even at 220 minutes the story never really dragged. There was enough drama to keep the pieces moving. Now that does not mean that you do not feel it, because you do but unlike a lot of other epics of it's time, I'm looking at you Ben-Hur, I was never bored. Sure I knew how the story would go but that doesn't mean that you can not enjoy the movie. Stand outs include Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson and Cedric Hardwicke. Even the effects of the Red Sea opening was nicely done, even for 1956.Was there stuff that I didn't like that kept me from going from like to love? Yes and it is our old friend Heston. The man could never act and no amount of argument can change my mind. Your lead is what we see the most and that walking ham just over did it every time he was on the screen. However unlike in Ben-hur, he didn't so over do it that I was taken out of the movie.So should you watch this movie? Yes, it is a classic that should be seen. The blu ray that I happen to watch was amazing and looked great. This is a movie that I would love to see on the big screen some day.",The Ten Commandments

I would like to point out that there is rarely a movie created to dramatize this event, and if it's so ""cheesy,"" then I'm sold, baby!One other thing. Someone called Aurlb said a very insulting thing about us cristians. I am positive he/she was an atheist for trampling such a spectacular event and indicating that God channels ""magic.""

192,flavia18,Some things that may have been overlooked,9,17 February 2007,"It may be just individual tastes, even with the change in time, but I have never been able to see how or why anyone could naturally assume Anne Baxter, attractive as she was, was ""obviously"" so much more beautiful than Yvonne deCarlo. I found Miss deCarlo lovelier, and not just because the script pointed out that ""Sepphora (Tzipporah)"" had a superior character. My guess is that deMille chose Miss deCarlo in that particular role because of the relative fame/box office of the two ladies - or because Miss deCarlo had a distinctly more ""earthy"" quality than Miss Baxter.Another even smaller but very important, note is Woody Strode. He says nothing in the film, and yet, in both scenes where he figures, he is the focus of attention. As the silent King of Ethiopia, you get the feeling that, even beaten in battle, he is unconquered, and knows himself to be Pharoah's equal. That his silence is not through fear, but pride. You cannot take your eyes from him. And when he is doing double-duty as one of Bithia's bearers, he uses a facial expression regrettably inflicted on black actors through the ages - that of wide-rolling eyed fear - but when *he* does it, you get none of the cringing, whining feel you get when other actors were out through this same pace. You get the natural fear of simple people - of any color - of a power greater than they understand.A lot of people damn this movie as camp, and there are loads of foul-ups - both technical and scriptural (shoe-horning Jesus into a story where he *cannot* belong is the worst and most insulting) - but the visuals are superb, the acting is fine and the movie itself a treat to watch; it stands the test of time.",The Ten Commandments

True, some of the players are totally miscast, such as Sir Cedric Hardwicke (a British accent in ancient Egypt?). None of the players resembles an actual Egyptian, and the dialogue borders on the ludicrous at times.
Nonetheless, the picture, filmed in the old tri-strip Technicolor, is beautifully photographed and provides a feast for the eyes. Alas, there is no bathtub scene.
Male lead Charlton looks, and acts, like the Midwestern man that he is, but still brings a strong masculine image to the film.
Yul Brynner merely replays his King of Siam character.

194,TheUnholyPeanut,An Epic Biblical Masterpiece filled with Amazing Spectacle.,9,11 April 2021,"After rewatching this movie this easter, I decided I was going to review this movie. And so, Here I am, Reviewing The Ten commandments. I will probably review more epics such as Ben-Hur, Lawrence of Arabia, Spartacus, The Bridge on the River Kwai, El Cid, and Doctor Zhivago but I decided to start here.First, The Acting and Characters. Charlton Heston is very good in this movie, and while his performance may not seem the best compared to his other performances, Charlton Heston still gives a great performance as Moses. Charlton Heston's character of Moses also has a fair amount of character development. Yul Brynner also gives a amazing performance as he plays the extremely intimidating Ramses II. Both characters are very different but still a very conflicted relationship, which makes the film much mor engaging.The dialogue does seem pretty cheesy but for me it is fine since the actors are all very good in the movie. The directing and production value are also superb. Some people complain that The Ten Commandments does not have the emotional value as movies like Ben-Hur, but I disagree since the amazing spectacle and images will constantly fill you with different emotions every minute. Some of the effects may seem dated such as the animated fire, but there is also effects that are ahead of there own time such as the parting of the Red Sea, which was made by having water fall on two sides into a giant container, then putting it in reverse.This film is also one of the most beautiful films ever made. The Cinematography is amazing in scenes such as the Chariot scene or the Blood River scene. Both scenes have intricate backgrounds filled with amazing colors. It is an absolute delight to the eyes as you take in the amazing, beautiful spectacle of this film. Elmer Bernstein also composed a masterful score for this film, as the score elevated the pure epic spectacle of the movie.The Ten Commandments is a great movie for everybody who sees it, despite your views. The Ten Commandments is overall a timeless classic filled with great characters and beautiful, amazing, spectacle.",The Ten Commandments

Then I saw the parting of the Red sea. I was trembling, and crying, and I had a great case of goosebumps. I am Christian, so I believe in it, but I never had understood the parting of the Red sea to be that spectacular. I never was able to picture this monumental event in my mind, until I saw that! So I watched the rest, and said to myself, ""I'll get this one out from the video library again!"" So I did! I did not find it as annoying that time. So I got it again, and again and again! Then I found it cheap at a K-Mart store, so I bought it! I LOVE this film!!! It is film making at it's best! First I found only the splitting of the sea amazing. Now I find the whole movie amazing! Chuck Heston really performed amazingly in this film! And Yul Brynner was the toughest portrayal of Rameses the great in any biblical film to this day! Please! Give this one a try!

197,bobbymeizer,One of the funniest movies ever made,9,27 August 2010,"I've seen this film more than a dozen times, it's one of my very favorites, but not for the same reasons as most of the other reviewers here at IMDb. Since childhood I have found this film absolutely hilarious. It's simply the most over-the-top, overblown spectacular from a director who's famous for his spectaculars. The cast of well-known and mostly accomplished actors were given full rein to ham it up to their hearts' content, and boy did some of them do just that. Anne Baxter is a particular standout as Nefretiri, overdoing both her early adoration of ""Moses! Moses! Moses!"" and her later villainous desire for revenge when he declines her love in favor of his God. Heston runs her a close second, no scenery is ever safe from this man's teeth, and he really sinks his teeth into this role of a lifetime. I especially love the way that his deepening religious inspiration is indicated primarily by the ponderousness of his voice and the length and whiteness of his beard. Edward G. Robinson also deserves honorable mention as the Hebrew ""trusty"" collaborating with the Egyptian oppressors. Even as great an actor as Yul Brynner is hysterical when having to deal with such an egregious script (""So let it be written"", so let it be bad). Cecil B. DeMille provides his own ridiculous narration, filled with pseudo-Biblical language, and things that sound like quotes but in fact aren't.The only thing that bothers me about this film is not the film itself, but the reaction of much of the American audience. They think this thing is an accurate reflection of the Biblical story of Moses and the Exodus. It's not at all, adding in tons of Hollywood romance and action that isn't there, and leaving out plenty of narrative that is there. Of course, that isn't really a problem historically because there's not a shred of archaeological evidence that Moses ever existed or the Exodus ever took place. But don't try to tell that to the American public; they aren't interested in facts, just mythology, and that's what one gets here in spades. Highly recommended to those with the wit to appreciate great camp.",The Ten Commandments
198,weghalbert,"The Good, The Bad , The Ugly....",9,7 April 2007,"OK If you have seen this giant epic, you know it has a cast of thousands, a star filled principle cast in the main leads, that for the most part does alright... The biggest problem with this dated epic is the director, old Cecil B DeMille had done these type of films for over 30 years and most of his other huge films are a lot more stiff than this one, but he did save some his best work here for last. (Cecil only lived 4 more years, his work finished) I think DeMille's best work was his 2nd to last film ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" , but that's just me. Blame DeMille for endless posing by Heston, Brynner. Both turn in great performances here, and should not be penalized by the constant distractions by Demille's heavy handed direction. Having seen this film at least 30 or more times since I was a child (Im only 2 years younger than the film) and being a film buff, I am very familiar with all the other work done by the cast. So here goes,,,,The Good...Heston, Brynner, Martha Scott, Yvonne DeCarlo, John Carradine,Henry Wilcoxon , Nina Foch ,Judith Anderson, Debra Paget, all turn in very good to decent performances here,,,, ,,,If you bear in mind they are limited by the script here (more on that later) The costumes are great..Edith Head with the help of many others did a wonderful job here. The sets are nothing short of magnificent,, and the special effects were state of the art for the time. The Parting of the Red Sea is still impressive. Original Music by Elmer Bernstein adds to the movie. The art direction is very well done, and the Cinematography by Loyal Griggs is quite good. All of these elements still hold up today...and its a lot of fun trying to spot all the other notable actors and actresses in bit parts in this film, such as Woody Strode, Clint Walker, Robert Vaughn, Mike Conners ,Gail Kope, Onslow Stevens, Michael Ansara, Richard Farnsworth ( as a Chariot driver) Kathy Garver (Cissy on Family Affair), Carl 'Alfalfa' Switzer (Yes that Alfalfa from ""Our Gang"" ,who was shot to death at the ripe old age of 31 during a disagreement over payment for a hunting dog!!!,,,and in a strange twist of fate died the exact same day as director Cecile B. DeMille, Jan 21, 1959...go figure who got the front page headlines the next day...not Alfalfa) and last but not least Herb Albert as Drummer on Mt. Sinai ,,,no trumpets back then,,,The Bad...The Script ,,,, I see where there were no less than four people who wrote this screen play this, and this element adds to the bloated feel of this film , along with DeMilles Direction. Perhaps if they had called in some real talent to work the script (Joseph L. Mankiewicz comes to mind) it would have added to this film , not detracted from it,,which this script does in abundance at times...DeMille,, He meant well, and was totally committed to bring this to the big screen using all his talents (but this sword cuts both ways) Some of his scenes work beautifully,mainly the ones were fewer actors/actresses are involved, but as the big crowd scenes get bigger and bigger, his direction becomes more and more stagy to the point of camp.John Derek,,,( Who could'nt act his way out of a wet paper bag) shows us once again he is great to look at for the ladies, but has the depth of a kiddie pool.... (Replacing him with someone like Jack Palance would have done wonders to the role of Joshua)Anne Baxter,,,Poor Anne, she is total camp here.she had the talent (see ""All About Eve) but she seems to be in on the joke, as her version of Nefertiri is laughable. (Ava Gardner or Rita Hayworth would have been a better fit for this role)Vincent Price,,,woefully miscast here as Baka,,,,(Someone like Lee Marvin or Richard Boone would have added some nice spice to this sadistic heavy)Cedric Hardwicke,,,,Oh he looks the part,,but is so boring as Sethi...(insert Fredric March )Edward G. Robinson,,,Everyone likes to pile on here. Yes . Edward does come across as a leftover gangster here, and seems to be in on the joke with Anne Baxter. (I can see George Sanders being perfect for this role, and why not as DeMille had used him before in ""Samson and Delilah"".The Ugly...With all the good intentions here, there are blatant false story lines as pointed out by many other reviewers,,,,at least get the story straight.The Bigger the crowds, the more action, Demille gets more and more stagy here. As many bad actors shout out their one line on cue without any flow whatsoever.,,,but then again that's just DeMille for ya>>>Cecil B. DeMille ...Narrator....just does not work (please send in Orson Welles or John Huston)All in All , I still enjoy watching this film,,the good points vastly outweigh the rest...a Classic,, and a one of a kind epic...",The Ten Commandments

It was perfectly built up from the beginning of Moses's life until he witnesses the burning bush. The character development was very well crafted, drawing you into the transformation of Moses from Prince of Egypt to an enlightened man of God. This in itself (DVD 1) was a powerful story of mans transformation by the Divine, which had you soaring in heights of wonder and introspection. The second DVD however, shows the deliverance of the slaves from their bondage from the pharaoh but seems like the development of the main character Moses, was lost altogether. The second DVD was more informational at most and important to history but did not add much to the overall film's objective of gripping story telling. Overall, probably the best film to describe Moses life and message, but if you only see the first DVD, you won't miss much on film experience by missing out on the second DVD.",The Ten Commandments

Unfortunately, it's interminable. The actors look ridiculous. Yul Brynner is constantly showing his pecs. Charlton Heston is taking himself too seriously (as often) and Anne Baxter is so far away from ""All about Eve"", ""A Royal Scandal"" or ""I Confess"" you might think it's another actress. The same goes for poor Edward G. Robinson of ""Little Caesar"" and ""Double Indemnity"" fame.

Though audiovision had been used as a standard for over 15 years at the arrival of this title, it has this overacted silent-movie feeling spread wide all over the production.When I saw this movie I had very high expectations. I learned that it is not always a good thing to have. I was just as demanding when I saw Ben-Hur for the first time, and it filled its own shoes as well as all of my hopes and its very own reputation. References aside, this film lacks relevance. It is far too aged and not by any means interesting. Not all bad though, there are some high-budget mammoth-scenes and some really acceptable SFX.I can't really recommmend this movie, not by any means.",The Ten Commandments

Especially liked the actor igra6 let them mock and looked, but all the movements and facial expressions were clear, without unnecessary movements. And what there were decorations and scenes, and some extras! No schedule does not replace it. The special effects are not cheap, he worked until the last detail, and let the technology of the time, but everyone is very clear. It is accustomed to the experience of Moses, his ups and downs, it was fine. The actor playing perfectly, and even though he probably had such a life, Chesney, hardworking, fair person, that has not changed even expulsion, except for the better. During the film suddenly began to play in my head the song Louis Armstrong ""let my people go"" and suddenly I began to realize what she had in mind translated some words to remember, he immediately thought of slavery in America and learned that the song sung long to Armstrong, even as slaves, blacks in America. This caused me such understanding of morality, which to me did not reach before.

(I find it funny that I have to put a spoiler notice on one of the most well known biblical story.) I saw this movie when I was nine, and had nightmares about it. I suppose they were trying to show the truth about slavery, but the part about the grease woman just got to me. The characters were overly dramatic, which always annoys me, and the story was stretched out too much. I suppose if I were to watch it now, I'd probably like it better, but from a child's point of view, the movie was terrifying!! My sister and I had to sleep with our parents after watching it. Instead, I suggest the Prince of Egypt, with great music and story.",The Ten Commandments

206,plummer-1,A Biblical epic that still looks great 45 years later!,10,1 April 2002,"This epic film has been a favorite of mine since I was young boy.  The set designs are stunning and the musical score is appropriately majestic.
Sure, the film takes cinematic licenses (the Bible says Moses was shy and had a speech impetiment, while Charlton Heston's voice rumbles with confidence)  Yul Brynner is arrogantly excellent as Rameses while Victor Price and (surprise!) Edward G. Robinson are wickedly appealing in their roles.When you see the special effects, it's hard to believe that ""The Ten Commandments"" was made in 1956.  The parting of the Red Sea and the earthquake near Mount Sinai are AWESOME!  Many movies made today wish their special effects looked so good.Another element that sets ""The Ten Commandments"" apart is its heart. DeMille never forgets that this story is about faith and God's good overcoming man's evil.  This film is deservedly considered a classic.",The Ten Commandments

Imagine that. Now, on a 65 inch flat-screen TV and with decent home sound system, it still holds up pretty well. (Just saw it again at Easter.) Sure, the acting is...well...it's very obvious acting. Over-the-top, a bit cartoonish in the poses and facial expressions. But that's how they made movies in the 1950's. They even got awards for these efforts. Oh, and some of the special effects are about as true as some of the computer-generated Junk today. Marvel and DC have gotten carried away, I think, and I can't help but see it all as a big cartoon (which these movies are.)

This story is very much about freedom of all people and that freedom ultimately will overcome all obstacles and chains that are placed upon it. It's movies such as these, that directors have to very careful if they try to create a 'better' version. 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' attempted to re-tell this story and it failed miserably at the box office.",The Ten Commandments
209,raphael65,You either love it or hate it. I LOVE it.,10,17 March 2005,"I, like many others, love this film. It is one of the greatest ever made, and most of those who condemn it do so either because they consider DeMille to have been talentless or because the film does not stick close enough to the Bible. The latter are generally ignorant of the research done for the film by Henry S. Noerdlinger (see his very informative book, ""Moses & Egypt: The Documentation to the Motion Picture..."")Director's style: DeMille's family bible & those found in many 19th-cent. homes were graced by the engravings of Gustave Dore, a French artist of the mid-1800's. His style, like that of the 17th-cent. French painter Poussin, was highly theatrical, with figures being depicted in admittedly unnatural poses, looking as if they were sculpted figures lifted from the frieze of the Parthenon. These artists were depicting larger-than-life events (like the Exodus) & did not wish to show them as mundane, everyday occurrences. DeMille's critics should look at these artists' attention to colour, composition, and exquisite detail, & then compare them to the works of later, more famous artists and try to maintain that the earlier works are inferior. Indeed, they display a level of talent which the later ones either did not possess or chose not to display. It is thus unfair to condemn DeMille's style, as every director has his own, either flamboyant or low-key.I won't address the question of whether or not Moses existed, but will say that the ""Biblical Minimalists"" who reject almost everything in the early part of the Torah have a very prejudiced agenda. Eager to destroy the hold that Judaism/Christianity have on people, they do their best to invalidate these religions' foundations. Appealing to questionable anachronisms in the Bible, they try to show that these cast doubt on the whole narrative, even though impartial, creditable scholars have found ample (though often circumstantial evidence) to support the existence of Abraham, Moses, etc. The question of who the Pharaoh of the Exodus was is tied to chronological considerations beyond the scope of this review, but many conservative scholars still put forth Rameses II as the best candidate. Story: An intoxicating mix of the Bible & somewhat streamlined Egyptian history. The love affair between Moses & Nefretiri as well as the characters of Memnet & Baka were taken from ""Prince of Egypt,"" a novel by Dorothy Clarke Wilson. Some liberties with the Bible are taken: one of them was a virtual necessity. In Ex. 32, when Moses finds his people worshipping the golden calf, he orders his fellow-Levites to slay 3000 of them. A mod. audience could not accept such brutality unless it came from God.. Thus the writers combined 2 incidents: the calf episode & the destruction of Dathan & Abiram, who were indeed swallowed up by the earth in a separate rebellion (Numbers 16). The writers incorporated traditions from the Midrash on Exodus into the film with consummate skill. The prominent role assigned to Dathan comes from such sources, as does the participation of Bithiah in the Exodus. Performances: Heston & Brynner are superb. Their acting is, at times, rather histrionic, but it should be remembered that in an epic less than grandiose-style acting is not in keeping with the subject matter. Yes, Anne Baxter hammed it up (but less than Jethro's daughters, who gush like lovesick teenagers over Moses), but such minor complaints are eclipsed by the overall lustre of the film, which does not have a single boring minute. Some have said that Edward G. Robinson seems too much like the gangster characters he played in other films. I had never seen these films prior to watching ""The 10 Commandments""; so this criticism only applies if one is accustomed to seeing him in such roles.Costumes: EXCELLENT. Even Moses' red robe with black & white stripes is based on a Jewish trad. which ascribes these colours to the Levite tribe, to which Moses belongs. The Egyptians (except for the priests) did NOT only wear white & were able to produce very diaphanous materials, though not as gorgeous as those seen on screen, but all the jewellery is authentic. Also, the dress of Egyptian queens did not emphasize the breasts, but DeMille was shrewd enough to realize that Anne Baxter's cleavage would attract male audiences. Sets & Props: VERY accurate: reliefs on treasure city's pylons were inspired by actual 19th Dynasty designs...throne seen in opening where Rameses I condemns all Hebrew male newborns to death is an EXACT replica of one found in Tutankhamun's tomb. Lettering on tablets is authentic Canaanite/Paleo-Hebrew.Special FX: Still look fantastic, though matte lines can be detected; their surreal look is effective. Use of effects animation to create pillar of fire better than real fire, as the Bib. fire was an unearthly one. An interesting & racially progressive element in the film is found in scene where Moses presents Ethiopian king & sister to Sethi. In 1956 racist America, it would have been unthinkable to show Moses involved with a black woman. But DeMille managed to suggest something here which would elude viewers unfamiliar with Josephus. In this source, Moses, as general of the Eg. army, cannot capture Saba, the Ethiopian capital, until Princess Tharbis (her name appears in the credits but is not spoken on screen) tells Moses that she will deliver the city to him if he weds her, to which he agrees. In the film, Tharbis (Esther Brown), with a provocative expression, hands a necklace to Moses, saying that he is ""wise."" Sethi: ""It is pleasing to the gods to see a man so honoured by his enemies."" ""And such a beautiful enemy!"" Nefretiri comments. Why is Moses wise? Because he married Tharbis to conquer Saba! And Nefretiri sees her as a rival! In a prejudiced era, DeMille was very daring. So much for accusations of his lacking subtlety! He was really quite progressive!",The Ten Commandments
210,BeckyandJesus,OK! Great for 60 years old,7,5 October 2016,"Wanted to see this as it has been on my watch list and a classic and called the best Ten Commandments/Exodus movie.The costumes are great (thought the slave dresses were too 1950's though and glamorous for that age, not 3000 years ago type clothing), acting is great, and the effects are fine for being 60 years ago. I'm not sure what they were able to do but things could've been better such as the snake eating the other snakes and other effects but the parting of the Red Sea was amazing. I was impressed with that. When Moses comes off the mountain I love his character after that. Best Moses I've seen. Can applaud them for choosing a great actor who portrayed Moses as I imagine him. (Didn't like him before leaving Egypt but he didn't know God then so it is OK). Wonderful acting!It takes nearly 2 1/2 hours to get into any actual plagues and only 3 of those are shown (water turned to blood, firey hail for a few seconds and the eventual first born death which was pretty good)The first two hours of the film has Pharaoh's wife in love with Moses (and him with her before leaving Egypt to go and live in the desert) and her enticing of him. It felt so ""old time 1950's Classic"" as they did back then with these beautiful actresses acting in the way the Pharaoh's wife did. Manna isn't shown, striking of rock isn't shown and several other parts of the bible. Last few minutes Moses is suddenly old and even some unbiblical characters and unbiblical parts. Joshua is very prominent with unbiblical parts and even before the exodus is seen many times.....cowering on the holy mountain??and he has a girlfriend who becomes Dathan's wife she nearly is sacrificed? So much of the film (over two hours) was spent leading up to something that seemed to become a great epic, but the rock strikingly the second lot of commandments, the dirty water becoming clean..the manna etc doesn't happen. Like the 2006 Doigray Scott version years suddenly drastically advance. The time spent in the first two hours was wasted. We didn't need to see Nephrateri kissing Moses goodbye and their love story shown..their love story isn't even biblical!!I have seen three now including this, the 1995 version with Ben Kingsley and the other with Dougray Scott (2006). I am not sure what is the most biblically accurate of the three. Seems like all three are the same with the amount of unbiblical material and changing things. I enjoyed the 1995 version most, but I could be bias as it is the first I saw. Certainly not bad for the time.",The Ten Commandments

I don't remember how many times I've seen this movie over the years, but I was super impressed tonight. People today find it hard to believe there were movies made during that era that had these graphics and sound effects! I think maybe the redoing of them with Dolby sound and other effects make them more interesting to watch.

I have watched it over ten times and never get tired of it and it always moves me emotionally and spiritually. The story line, the effects and acting were all top notch. Also the cinematography for this movie is out standing. One of the things that is so great about The Ten Commandments is although it is a movie version, it is very close to the real story in the bible for those that believe. The story line is good Vs evil but it is very encouraging in many ways and shows you that no matter what may be against you, if God is on your side, you cannot be defeated.

No doubt it was incredible for audiences back then to see these epic Biblical scenes on the big screen for the first time. But when time progresses - as it has - and the Red Sea departing looks like nothing more than a bathtub on a green screen, this film sadly doesn't have much more to offer.

218,cybersongs,You have to see the original in a real theatre,10,31 March 2006,"This film cannot be remade. cgi is not going to make this classic better, it can only do worse, and anyone can see the difference, even a 2 year old.To know why Moses' hair turns white or is shortened, you have to actually watch the film.DeMille was often criticised for his lavish expenditures, yet he never made a film that lost money.Moses leads the people Israel out of bondage and in so doing upsets the world leader of the times, his adoptive father, Pharoah.Many critics have written about this film, most of whom have gotten the content all wrong. So, you have to see this film from 1956 before seeing any attempt at an impossible remake.""The Ten Commandments"" is about those ten laws, not moral codes or ethics, but actual laws, that every lawyer and judge love to argue about as some kind of religious conflict between state and church; this is precisely what Moses and Pharoah argue about, Who's law is it, anyway? As such, the film shows not only what the basis of law is, but who suggested the profession of judges, since there were no judges before Moses time, only administrators acting on behalf of dictators.There is so much to this film that every frame of it was justified. I seriously doubt than any remake will have anywhere near the length of this film, which required an half hour intermission and during the 1950's you could still get a real meal in a theatre, nor can it achieve the quality of a once in history masterpiece. The film represents also a once in history masterpiece event, liberation from slavery in Africa. And its script stuck strictly to the original story line.There were two originals, both directed by DeMille; one in 1923 and one in 1956. Both original because one was black and white with no sound, and the other was done by DeMille when colour and sound were available, and he topped his first production with this one.This is what a film should be and cgi should stay on the computer, where it belongs, and be forbidden from film works. Were Cecil B. DeMille and the cast around today, he and they would insist on much better special effects than can be provided by the limitations of digital reality ""look-alikes"" {are you kidding me with the spell checker? - a typical example of how computers simply can't get it right - ""look-alikes"" as well as the square brackets as tags instead of parentheses - there were five things the computer cgi missed from this human director as well - I have ""misspelt"" nothing, perhaps Miriam Webster is the one who can't spell in English and does not know the conjugations of the Enlish language - oops! the cgi has ""misspelt"" ""English"" and missed its misspelling! Is there any other proof needed to show that cgi can't remake this film?}.And Hollywood should just leave well enough alone and try, for a change, to make something original, as DeMille and his cast and crew did.Find it in a theatre, or ask for it in Santa Cruz at one of the world's only remaining drive in theatres, you will clearly see that any attempt to remake it is sheer vanity.This was no cheap film. It ranks among the greatest films ever made, and right up there with DaVinci's ""Mona Lisa"" and Michaelangelo Buonaroti's ""David.""

De Mille truly was a great filmmaker. His powerful imagination is evident in the Ten Commandments. This is his masterpiece. It carries you along on an epic adventure that is as big as the old testament. It captures the ancient, epic feel of the original Bible story. It has several stunning performances that could have easily been cheesy and fake, but are convincing and fascinating. Some say that the dialog is campy. I don't think so. I've seen this movie many times and have never thought so. It's nothing like the terrible dialog in Plan 9 From Outer Space from the same decade. The romance may be a cliché now, but it was quite original when it first came out and is still interesting. I personally don't like romance, so the fact that I wasn't bothered by this one is really saying something. This marvelous story is wonderfully told by De Mille and I would strongly recommend it.",The Ten Commandments
223,rsartisttouch-1,"A Rare, Timeless Film Does Justice to the word ""Classic"".",7,1 October 2005,"This film is so popular and DeMille puts together such a cast that if anyone out there is thinking about a remake, I would guess the casting department would be mulling over who would play Charlton Heston, rather than Moses; who would portray Yul Brynner as Rameses; and who would be the perfect Ann Baxter? Doing a remake of DeMille's rendition would be like remaking THE WIZARD OF OZ or CASABLANCA.When her character is introduced at the beginning of the film, Ann Baxter looks stunning as she strikes a now classic pose. She also does a great job toying with Rameses mind in the palace, as both her and Rameses pray for their dead firstborn son to be brought back to life by the god, Horus. The words ""So let it be written; so let it be done"" spoken by Rameses father, and then by Rameses II. My favorite line spoken by Yul Brynner is: ""The slaves are mine; their lives are mine; all that they own is mine."" This finally cements his image as a truly tyrannical Pharoah, though any child would have figured this out already. The screenwriter loves to have the cast refer to Moses by saying his name twice in succession: ""Moses, Moses!"" I told myself once I would sit down and count how many times ""Moses, Moses!"" was said in the film. There is one segment of the film however, where the script is so 1950s cornball I can barely stand it. Everyone is so happy that all good things begin happening at once, i.e. "" ... You have a newborn son!"" (Yay Yay) If this happened in modern times someone surely would bellow ""I won the lottery"". (The scene I am referring to is when the slaves are leaving Rameses' city heading for the promised land).Still, DeMille successfully translates his own majestic, original vision creating this epic for the big screen. When I saw it the first time on the big screen at age seven, I thought this was the greatest movie ever! The frequent cornball dialog in places is easily forgotten when one becomes awestruck by all of the huge, glorious sets which are favorably complimented by solid art direction, cinematography and, as advertised at the time, ""a cast of thousands!"" This film is a ""must see"" for any serious film student, fan or fanatic! Enjoy with lotsa popcorn!",The Ten Commandments

In fact, to refer to it as ""a film"" is like referring to the American flag as just a piece of cloth.The Ten Commentments (1956) is a dramatic, beautifully photographed, deeply moving religious experience which, like the Commandments themselves, can speak to all people of any time period.The recent made-for-TV remake (2006) paled by comparison.I don't care how many stand-up comics make fun of Edward G.

As far as I'm concerned, DeMille must have been guided by God Himself in making this film, for DeMille has given all believers a truly inspiration document of faith that will stand forever.",The Ten Commandments
225,Kvasi,Scriptural inaccuracy,5,9 September 2005,"I just want to comment on the scriptural inaccuracy in this movie. Not whether it's a good movie or not, you can still appreciate the movie. But don't think you learn anything about Shemot (Exodus) when watching it.Look at this for example, this is what Shemot says:Shemot 2:10-15 ""10. The child grew up, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became like her son. She named him Moses, and she said, ""For I drew him from the water."" 11. Now it came to pass in those days that Moses grew up and went out to his brothers and looked at their burdens, and he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man of his brothers. 12. He turned this way and that way, and he saw that there was no man; so he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 13. He went out on the second day, and behold, two Hebrew men were quarreling, and he said to the wicked one, ""Why are you going to strike your friend?"" 14. And he retorted, ""Who made you a man, a prince, and a judge over us? Do you plan to slay me as you have slain the Egyptian?"" Moses became frightened and said, ""Indeed, the matter has become known!"" 15. Pharaoh heard of this incident, and he sought to slay Moses; so Moses fled from before Pharaoh. He stayed in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.""This is what Cecil B. DeMille has stretched to almost 2 hours (first half of the movie).

I suppose that directors like Cecil B. DeMille had a much more keen interest in staying true to the classic storyline and exposing it, instead of contemporary filmmakers who are insistent on interjecting political and social relevency into ancient stories.

A movie withwellquite a few biblical inaccuracies. Despite this, Ten Commandments is one of my favorite movies. Now everyone will be in shock when I say this, but it's a fairly modern and deep movie. It's a movie that uses old style, with new methods. Let's take a look line by line.Direction- Cecil B. Demille is a overdone, theatrical kind of director, and the result is a theatrical overdone kind of movie. But when the Bible is concerned, that's really the way to do it. Overdone gestures, poetic screenplay, massive sets and thousands of extras make this film a giant in Hollywood's history. Demille pulls it off however with his overblown style and flair. There are a few cringe worthy moments of poorly directed extras, but it generally works. It's overdone style was the director's intent. So I bet you're wondering how could this possibly be modern? Well it's Demille's amazing effects he used, lavish sets and deep story that makes it modern. Most movies at the time would cut away when the dead sea caves in, or show just a facade of a city, or a backdrop. Demille shows it all. Scenes such as the slaughtering of the newborn or the Passover were fairly intense at the time, and most movies would, no pun intended, pass over them. So like I said, Demille does this all in old theatrical style, but the actual content of the film was fairly advanced for the time. Charlton Heston- Very few can part the dead sea and you'll believe they just did it. Very few can be Moses. Heston gives a great performance of Moses that seems just like how you picture him when you read it in the bible. Search for someone else to play a better Moses, but I bet it'll be in vain. Yul Brynner- Cast as Ramses the Pharaoh, he steals the show in his outstanding performance. He's pompous, arrogant, but delivers great lines. He's also very deep, as that he's simply a leader who was determined, just for the wrong cause. He loves his son and his wife, despite the fact that the latter never returns any love to him. He delivers such a great performance, that he almost makes you want him to win. In the end, he won't however, no matter how long he may pray before the mighty falcon. Anne Baxter-Is the film's 'Beautiful enemy'. She's in the center of the love triangle between Ramses and Moses, the latter of who she is madly in love with. She's plays someone who's self centered, manipulative, power hungry and superficial and she plays it with remarkable ability. She fit's the classic 'Queen of Egypt' model movies strive for back then. I personally would have liked to seen her play Cleopatra. Sure, it may have been a semi-repeat role playing another Egyptian, but ""She was Egypt"".Sir Cedric Hardwicke- He plays the first Pharaoh seen in the film, father of Ramses. He does a terrific job in that role, playing a wise, understanding but firm leader. He speaks his line in stage like fashion and is all together convincing. He may have one of the deepest characters, as you will see in the film. John Derek- All films have their weaknesses, and this film's weakness is John Derek's portrayal of Joshua. Overacting, even on Demille's standards, and poor delivery of his lines makes his performance almost laughable. He brings the film down a little and is probably the worst part of the film. I don't see how he was cast, maybe he thought it would be the day his career is born. As it turns out, it's not that day, Joshua. Edward G. Robinson- Yes, America's favorite gangster was cast as a Hebrew turncoat, Dathan, who is an informant with 'Rat's ears and a ferret's nose'. Despite people's criticism of his performance, I thought he did a rather good job. He had his moments where I thought he'd say 'Step back Moses, or I'll plug ya, that goes for you too Joshua and the rest of you mugs' but he was still pretty good.Other Supporting characters- The rest of the cast is pretty good, Yvonne DeCarlo is solid and Vincent Price has a scene stealing performance as Baka, the Master Builder.Special Effects- Phenomenal. Who needs CGI when you can build the city of Pi-Ramses instead? This coupled with the partying of the Red Sea, the Nile turning to blood, the hail turning the fire, the staff turning into a snake along with countless other effects are amazing to watch. Most old movies would avoid those effects by cutting away-not the Ten Commandments. I'd say it has the best pre-1990's special effects of all time.Costumes- Breathtaking. The bright and ornate costumes really capture the essence of the time.Set Design- Incredible. Like I said for the special effects, do you really need Digital effects if you can just do this? Very few movies can rival the massive sets of this film. It's as if you are actually in Egypt.Musical Score- A joy to listen to. The pompous overblown score fits with the rest of the feel of the movie. Who else wouldn't want to enter and exit a room wit the same fanfare that Ramses does?All in all, the Ten Commandments is a classic. It is a surprisingly deep film, that uses theatrical style with modern methods. The film is among my favorites. With outlandish sets and costumes, over the top music, a poetic screenplay, outstanding effects, and exceptional acting, this is a film that is great in all regards, and will be enjoyed with all generations, a film worthy of 'the gods'. So it shall be written, so it shall be done.",The Ten Commandments
230,david-1122,A movie of colossal grandeur and special effects,10,4 November 2003,"The Ten Commandments is truly a magnificent film and to be seen by all ages. The vastness of the movie sets, the music score, the storyline not to mention the special effects makes this a memorable film.  However as to whether the storyline ie  the Hebrews were slaves in Egypt, being true is a debatable subject.  I constantly watch discovery and history channels on Sky TV (on ancient Egypt, the Pyramids etc) and nowhere in any of these programmes is there any mention that these monuments were built by Hebrew slaves. In fact the only mention as to the builders and workers were Egyptian farmers who volunteered their services.  I, myself, being Jewish, and have always been taught that the Hebrews were slaves in Egypt. Is there any reader who can convince me otherwise.   I recently went to Egypt and were given a tour by an Egyptianologist who was unable to tell me with any certainty that the story of the Exodus was true.",The Ten Commandments

The movie is very poetic, touching and has a very important yet simple message - who are we to take someone's liberty away?One of my all time favorites, a true classic, well done Cecil B. DeMille and crew.",The Ten Commandments
232,cwente2,DeMille's Final Film as a Director,10,17 November 2005,"""The Ten Commandments"" is a milestone film. For some, those of us in their 50's or older, it represents the end of an era: Some call it ""The Golden Age of Hollywood""; the beginning of the end of the studio system; and the end of a period in which the real founders of the ""public art"" took, or began to take, their final bows -- DeMille, Zukor, Goldwyn, Selznick, and others.For those of us who saw ""The Ten Commandments"" on the big screen and in one of the now extinct gilded movie palaces of yesteryear, the picture holds special memories. There is a sense of nostalgia that accompanies any new viewing of this one-of-a-kind Victorian pageant. For many, I'm sure, the nostalgia extends beyond the film itself.There were problems in the mid-fifties, as in every decade since the real Moses came down from Mount Sinai. Polio, the continuing menace of poverty, the material and spiritual separateness of what we called ""colored people"", Communism, etc. But . . . there were virtues too, many reflected in the writing and performances of ""The Ten Commandments"": Virtues like courage, strength of character, personal honor, and endurance were paramount (no pun intended). The biggest problem in schools was students chewing gum in class. Today, it's students ""shooting-up"" in parking lots or shooting down their classmates in the halls. . . America had an identity then.DeMille's vision was, always, of ""an ideal"". He painstakingly produced authentic looking packages in which to wrap his vision -- embellished by the ""glitz"" of what was, then, the ""ideal"" Hollywood portrait: Bluer than blue skies; shimmering, jewel-encrusted costumes; out-sized architecture; dramatically convenient thunderbolts; and perfectly lovely female leads, with make-up invariably and predictably un-smudged. DeMille gave his audience what they expected from an ""A"" picture. He wasn't interested in realism. His idea was to reinforce values he'd learned from his parents and his brother (a noted playwright) in a dramatic format which could be ""felt"" by young and old, alike . . . more a reverence for time-honored principles than the analytical, ironic, and questioning approach dominant in the films of today. There was in the 50's and the 40's a more amicable attitude toward ""orthodoxy"" -- in all its forms. Hence, the overwhelming popularity of every DeMille production released during that period.After fifty years, ""The Ten Commandments"" is still impressive visually, dramatically, and especially in terms of the intensity of its convictions (reflected in all the biographies of the principals) . . . something which cannot be said of many similar big-budget pictures of the same era.One day, someone may attempt a re-make. Expect that it will be visually impressive and less ""stagy"". But . . . expect, as well, that it will be punctuated with the obligatory mandates of political correctness; an uncertainty about its message; and a healthy dose of Twenty-First Century cynicism. It will be more ""realistic"" to be sure, but far less ""authentic"" -- like a perfume ad, physically attractive, but without a ""heart"".",The Ten Commandments

As M becomes more God-like, alas, he also becomes less interesting. At movie's end, the wife (Lili Munster?) says how much she loves him, and it's a tough line to swallow in any century. She may as well proclaim her love for the two granite tablets.The movie is saved by its villains, particularly the eternally bald Yul Brynner, who depicts bludgeoning stubbornness so well we assume he was like that in real life, and the smarmy Edward G. Robinson, to whom God must also have been speaking, perhaps in the Brooklyn patois.Anne Baxter as Nephritiri (silly me, I thought the 'ri' was supposed to be a 'ti"") is delectable throughout the movie, from princess to queen to Mom.

I like it.,8,3 December 2018,"This movie is wreathed in good acting, astonishing special effects and there are some special immersing atmosphere, which endures throughout the whole movie. However the people who are not familiar with the real story in the Bible could be easily mislead, due to the fact the plot is adjusted to fit with flick based story.Yet this is not very important, because in my opinion I haven't saw anything at all that could be considered wicked, blasphemous or so on, Saying this I've seen a lot of modern movies based on Bible or whatever, which in some way aim to disgrace God and the Bible.
I personally enjoyed when Moses was portraiture as courteous man, although I highly doubt it was so in the real bible story( i haven't read the whole Moses story).Anyway the phrase ""Oh, Moses!"" left a warm, cozy trace in my memory.
The Charlton Heston in some way remind me for A. Schwarzenegger with his deep voice and take it very serious acting. Great actor for great role. Anne Baxter is also very eye catchy with hers pure beauty, so distend to todays woman beauty pattern.

242,valerielawrence_us,The Ten Commandments,10,22 July 2006,"While I am not religious, this film, in its grandiosity and scope is very compelling. Charleton Heston proves his ability to play a larger than life character. What I wonder about is why it took God 400 years to free the Israelites? And then forced them to wander for 40 years in the desert before leading them to the promised land (golden idle aside). One could make cynical remarks that a man who prays to God to see the 'deliverer' before he dies, and then accidentally sees that 'deliverer' before he dies, yet he isn't made aware of it. The other actors in the film, flush it out fully. Every special effect in this film was done in the real world - no CG. Its too easy for us now to watch movies filled with CG effects and view them as 'real.' If the movie seems a bit pompous and corny to the 21st century viewer, it can only be because the 21st century viewer has lost his or her innocence and watches from a more jaded and cynical perspective.

It may be a good idea for as many people as possible to see this movie, particularly those people who don't like Jewish people. If Arabs or Persians or Asians or anyone else were to spend the time and watch this movie they might understand more of the history of the Jews and how they pretty much invented freedom and the law. Yes, they had help from the LORD and right now we could all use some help from above. And we also should learn the history of other religions, religions such as Islam.

247,drohmark,"Then, new epic visuals. Now, simply awful.",1,7 June 2021,"Not easy to write a review after more than 300 however, after reading a dozen or so positive to glorious reviews, I'm forced to give some perspective. Mid 1950's and DeMille produces an ""epic"" film for its day with all-star cast names and huge visual effects. The fact that its long presentation of the biblical story wanders a bit and used trite devices to make it popular to a large, white, shock-avoidant audience, was widely ignored. 1956 America was white, largely middle-class, and all about Ozzie and Harriet and Art Linkletter stereotypes. The most disturbing TV viewing, and it was largely ignored, was a white, redheaded Lucy Ball married to a Cuban American Desi Arnaz while sleeping in separate beds.DeMille's movie, in retrospect, portrayed a 19th post-civil war Southern depiction of the Bible with an all white cast playing Semitic characters. The worst offense, unforgivable, in my opinion, Edgar G Robinson with a New York City accent. I like much of his work, Soylent Green as an example, but this was absurd. A close second, Heston because his acting was stiff and fake. Chosen reportedly, because he looked the most closely physically to the way the people of the Bible, (Egypt, Israel, et al are in the Middle East-not Europe) in those days and mostly still are. People of Middle Eastern descent were portrayed in every other medium from calendars to portraits, as fair skinned, blue-eyed even, and European. If this was and is a 10 out of 10 movie, why do we only see it at Easter and similar holidays? Because, it is traditional and few movies are made these days for those holidays. It is an old, outdated, racially and religiously offensive movie made by a director who was racially and religiously offensive and a studio system past its prime days of morality, if ever. This movie deserves to only be shown in a college History of Film class, freshman level. I would not recommend it to anyone, ever. However, if it is your family's Easter tradition and Brenner's Russian accent and Robinson's NY accent don't make you laugh out loud, then waste the time and try to keep the kids in the room. Even then, think twice.",The Ten Commandments
248,mirrr1,Just tell me why,3,14 October 2007,"each and every movie about Moses rounds the edges and simply omits the parts of the Tanakh that don't go well with Christian point of view?

I shall lay my hand on Egypt and with great acts of judgment.' 'I shall ensure that the Egyptians are so impressed with this people that when you go, you will not go empty-handed. Every woman will ask her neighbor for silver and golden jewelry, and clothing. In these you will dress your own sons and daughters, despoiling the Egyptians of them.'So basically, a Jewish tribal god wants to exact as much revenge as possible on those who dared to torment his nation, then rob them, lead their king to the trap at the Red Sea and destroy him. Nothing surprising about this: Yahweh IS a cruel and brutal deity, unlike your forgiving, liberal, comfy Jesus. So why are the movie-makers so inconsistent?

I have it on tape and watch it every Easter. The screenplay is so over-done, you fall down laughing in places that are supposed to be dead serious. The scene where Ramses talks to Dathan (Edward G. Robinson) about Moses is a camp classic. Yul Brynner steals every scene he is in. He doesn't even have to talk. Check out the scene where his servants dress him up to go chariot riding after the recently departed Jews. As the narrator intones ""Again Pharoah's heart was hardened.""

However, this film has so many cultural and racial (yes racial) inaccuracies, coupled with over the top acting and bad dialogue that I cannot see it as 'one of the greatest films of all time.' It also has a great historical inaccuracy in it where it leads the viewer to believe that the pyramids were built by Hebrew slaves. What about the pyramids that existed prior to and after Hebrew enslavement? Archaeologists and historians have proved otherwise.

257,user-554-485417,Fantastic movie!,10,13 December 2012,"I watched the Ten Commandments. It is a movie filmed in the 1950s, one my dad's favorites. I am amazed by how the visual effects were so good back then. The parting of the sea was not as good as it is now, but I am amazed that they could do that with such little technology. This is a summary of the movie: Moses was cast in the Nile in a basket. His mother was protecting him from being killed by orders of the Egyptian Pharaoh. An Egyptian princess finds him and takes him as one of her own. As Moses grows to become a great general, he falls in love with Nefretiri. While an old woman, who was actually his mother, was working on a pillar, she was almost crushed to death. Moses saw this and told off the supervisor. He then met Joshua, who tells him about God. Moses really wanted the slaves to not endure so much suffering in their work. Ramseses calls Moses the ""Deliverer"". Moses was the person to fulfill the prophecy. Memnet tells Nefretiri about how Moses is a Hebrew. She kills him. Moses goes to his family and realizes that he is a Hebrew. Liliah is engaged to Joshua, but Baka tries to capture her. Joshua saves her but is captured instead. Moses rescues Joshua but kills Baka. Dathan hears Moses telling Joshua that he is a Hebrew. Moses is arrested, but he claims that he only wants to free the slaves. Moses is sent to the desert and comes to the land of Midian. He meets several girls and he learns that their father is a Hebrew. Moses marries one of the daughters. When Moses was taking care of the sheep, he saw a burning bush. It was God's voice telling him to free the Hebrews. Moses returns to Egypt, but the pharaoh wouldn't let Moses' people go. Ten plagues were then set upon Egypt. The pharaoh's first born dies. He was so distraught that finally he let the Hebrews go. Moses parts the Red Sea and the Hebrews run to the other side of the sea. But as the pharaoh's warriors followed them, the sea closed and they drowned. As Moses goes up to Mount Sainai to receive the Ten Commandments, his followers built the Golden Calf. When Moses finds out, he becomes furious and throws the tablets at the Golden Calf, causing it to explode. God sends them to wander around the desert for 40 years.",The Ten Commandments
258,evan-przesiecki,Revisiting The Ten Commandments,8,30 March 2013,"It had been about 7 years since I've seen The Ten Commandments, prior to watching it on ABC this Saturday evening. Certainly I remembered many of the iconic sequences, such as the parting of the Red Sea and Moses' encounter with God on Mount Sinai, yet the experience was very fresh.The plot of The Ten Commandments should be familiar to most modern audiences. Though, for those who are unaware, it tells the story of Moses: a Hebrew born to slaves who is rescued and raised as a prince in Ancient Egypt. As he learns of his heritage, he ultimately sets out on a mission to liberate his people from their rule under the oppressive pharaoh and his half-brother Ramses II. The film is approximately 3 hours and 40 minutes long. With commercials included on ABC's annual broadcast, I had spent about 4 hours and 45 minutes on my couch watching the television screen. Surprisingly, none of this took a toll on my interest in the film. I've always had a strong, sentimental love for epics, so this should really come as no surprise. However, DeMille really knows how to keep his audience engaged. Never in the film does a scene drag. While the film is admittedly rather campy and remains on familiar sets, it is very much in motion. A new detail in the plot emerges frequently and DeMille's narrative is extremely easy to understand.Well, for the most part, that is. What I had noticed more so in my viewing this time around was the dialogue and its very...formal nature. All the actors use larger-than-life words and speak with no rhetorical devices to spare. Metaphors, similes, puns – this film has got it all. At times – particularly in scenes where Ramses is longing for Nefretiri's affection – you'll be amazed how these actors come off speaking with straight faces. While the dialogue can be funny at times, it can also certainly be repetitive. At times, this is for obvious stylistic purposes, such as ""So it is written, so it shall be done"", which plays a big role in the film's final message. Other times, the repetition can be exhausting. If I had a penny for every time a character said ""Bondage""....The dialogue can definitely prove to be more complicated for younger audiences. Though, the point of what the actors are trying to convey often comes across through their actions. After all, from what I noticed, the film is as much a visual experience as it is based in dialogue. The characters' emotions and actions really move the narrative forward – especially Ramses', whose jealousy over Moses is conveyed so well by Yul Brynner.The visuals in The Ten Commandments are quite lovely. The film has some top-notch sets, although many are re-used in various sequences throughout the film. The desert landscapes, grand Egyptian cities and shots of the Nile River really take audiences back to Ancient Egypt and are extremely vibrant in life and colour. One can particularly notice this vibrancy with modern HD broadcasts of the film, as I had seen on ABC. Not only are they colourful, but the sets are so full of life. There are numerous extras all dressed up in carefully- crafted costumes each doing their own action on-set. They are all real, too, mind you. Remember: there was no CGI in 1956. The film definitely takes you back not only to ancient Egypt, but to a time in Hollywood history in which sets were truly spectacle. Seldom will you see a film of this scale in the 21st century.The Ten Commandments does make use of special effects to enhance its settings. For the most part, they're outdated, but what can you expect? Again, it was 1956 when this was made. Moses' staff turning into a snake comes off as cartoonish and even the iconic parting of the Red Sea is unconvincing. The problem with older films like The Ten Commandments and their primitive special effects is their heavy reliance on them. The film's narrative is dependent on translating grand spectacles and has to indulge in exploiting special effects to a high degree. Ultimately, the more primitive special effects, the more dated the film is. Many shots can prove to be an eyesore for modern audiences, but I never found them distracting. If anything, they were rather neat. I always find it interesting to see how filmmakers make the most of the available technology during their time period, and The Ten Commandments did an excellent job. The film even managed to gain an Academy Award for its efforts in visual effects.Also, not all of the artificial visuals are an eyesore. For instance, when Moses turns the water of Egypt into blood, my mind is still blown as it was 7 years ago.Accompanying all the visuals is a score composed by the critically acclaimed Elmer Bernstein. All in all, the music he has composed for the film defines all that is epic. It certainly makes use of a surround sound system in your home theatre. Though, I found that watching it this time around it was rather repetitive. Quite often the same music was used repetitively, with slight modifications. Nevertheless, the soundtrack definitely manipulated my emotions at points, especially during the opening credits – the chill that went down my spine during then was overwhelming, to say the least.All in all, The Ten Commandments is just as spectacular as I remembered it so many years ago. I've noticed some flaws during my second viewing, but this is normal with most films.It's ultimately triumphant where it truly counts, as it has gorgeous visuals and a truly compelling narrative that makes the most out of its nearly 4 hour running time.I highly recommend the film to audiences of all ages. Although it's flawed, it is nothing short of a classic.",The Ten Commandments
259,elias-37,The Ten Commandments STILL one of the GREATEST FILMS EVER!,10,3 January 2005,"Cecil B. DeMille was one of the greatest film producers of all time. He always bridged the current trends and produced films people really enjoyed and wanted to see! His last epic, ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) still is thrilling and this timeless classic still attracts audiences world-wide. To be able to see this great film in the original and improved format (Arclight Theatres in Hollywood, CA) will be exciting and I am purchasing a number of seats for my family and friends. And the message of this film is as relevant today as today's morning newspaper! I WOULD HOPE IN 2006 WHEN THIS WONDERFUL FILM CELEBRATES ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY, A VERY SPECIAL CELEBRATION WILL BE HELD and if so, I hope to attend! I attended the opening of this film at the Criterion Theatre in New York in 1956. So, my recommendation, my very strong recommendation, get over to Hollywood at the Arclight and enjoy this classic on the big screen and be thrilled again or for the first time!",The Ten Commandments
260,shanalishah,Food for Thought,10,8 January 2018,"This film is about that great event that happened approximately 3000 years ago from today, God has created men independent and self-sufficient, and has advised him to live in rules of God. But some insults enslaved man, this film is about Egypt's that time when Pharaoh of Egypt had made slave the Israelites living there, they used to build their city by oppressing them, Israelites follow Abraham's religion they believe a messiah from God will free them from Pharaoh. 
One day a little angel is born in the Yoshebel's house and Pharaoh hear the prediction about a child birth in Israelites who will uprising against his empire orders that kill all new born boys of Israelites, for the save his child Yoshebel put his son in a basket and adrift in Nile river. Pharaoh's daughter Bithiah who is widow and childless finds that basket feeling happy and adopt the boy her servant Memnet warn her because of the cloth the child wrap out it's belong to Israelites but Bithiah ignore that and names the baby Moses and Moses growup in Pharoah's palace.
Moses becomes young and becomes a very brave and general of the Egypt's army, he wins the battle against Ethiopia, he loves with princess Nefretiri who will be wife of next Pharoah. Pharoah asked Moses to build new city and asked Remeses to find matrix for which Israelites is looking for.
Once Moses arrives to the city. He won the heart of Israelites with the way he treated them. He allows to take leave on weekend and provide full food to everyone. Remeses started propaganda about this act as Moses is planning to uprising. Pharoah reached at that city to confirm Moses act but get impressed by the build he made. 
Once it get published revealed that Pharoah is going to announce Moses as his next pharoah for that nation. Memnat met to Nefretiri and informed her that Moses didn't take birth in this palace. He is the son of Israelites. She also showed the cloth in which Moses was raped in his when they found him. Nefretiri killed Memnat to make it secret but at that time Moses arrives and finds that cloth. On his several asking Nefretiri reveal the truth that he is the son of Youshabel not Bithiah.
Bithiah met to Youshabel as she hinted that Moses was going to visit his own house. She asked Youshabel to migrate her family as earliest as she can but Moses reached their while their conversation. On asking to Youshabell he got know the truth.
Moses started to live with Israelites to get understand the logic that why a man has to be slave to another. He started working with labor. One day a soldier had killed by him to save another labor Joshuva.
Remeses get him arrest as he knew the act of Moses and represent himself as the matrix of Israelites for people are waiting for. Pharoah announced Remeses as a next pharoah and asked him to punish Moses by himself.
Remeses leaved Moses in a long desert with one day food as he wanted him to die by own self. Moses gets save himself by the blessing of God and reached a village Midian where he met Jethro's 7 daughters. Moses helped these daughters at a moment on that mark Jethro asked him to marry one of his daughter and he settled there.
At that village there was a mountain named Sinai, people rumors about that God is in that mountain but Moses couldn't understand that theory. One day Joshuva reached there and he found Moses and asked him to return back to Egypt, the condition became worst. While the conversation Moses found an unnatural movement at mountain, he saw fire inside a tree but that fire didn't burn. He asked Joshuva to take rest and he went to that mountain. Where he hear the Voice of God. God asked him to leave for Egypt to save people life from Pharoah.
Moses cames to pharoah and asked to free his people. Pharoah denied. Moses throws his stick to show the curse of God which transform into the snake. Pharoah laughed and asked Jannes for the same trick. But the Moses's snake eaten all others. Pharoah still denied. 
After that Egypt went through God cursed. Water became poison for 7 days, Mosquitoes & insects attacked the people of Egypt. Rain felt with thunderstorm. But Remeses denied fulfilling his wishes and he ordered to kill the first born of all Israelites. But that act return to Egypt Peoples. Remeses's child also died.
Finally Remeses released all the Israelites. Moses brings them out from Egypt behind Remeses follow them with his army to attack. At the Neel River Moses got the way in river by the Blessing of God. And all of his people reached to other side. Remeses also asked their army to cross that way but River's wall get closer and they all died.
Moses reached to Mount Sinai and asked people to stay as he can get the message of God to visit the peak. Moses didn't come for many days. People start constructed a golden calf for pray. When Moses return with Ten Commandments in written by God he found people in that condition. Moses throw stone to golden calf and destroy also people were praying also get died.
After 40 years, Aged Moses asked people to go to the Canaan in the leadership of Joshuva. And he walks alone.",The Ten Commandments
261,mickey-rom,Anne Baxter's great line,10,8 February 2007,"Moses,Moses,Moses......Silly Moses,he could have been Pharaoh,and then the Jews could have ruled Egypt.Besides,Nefertiri was quite a dish. OK...they insist on more lines,so here goes. I really like this movie,not for it's historical accuracy,or its biblical meaning,but just for the sheer spectacle.Heston will forever be Moses in my view.I think they styled the older Moses on Michaelangelo's statue.He sure looked like it. Who but Yul Brynner could have played the arrogant Ramses the second. Ahhh....they don't make epics like this any more.Cecil B...we miss you. I especially enjoyed the brilliant color and the magnificent musical score.All this was done without any computer generated special effects,can one imagine what they would do with this story this day? I wonder who would be cast as the main characters.I honestly cant even come up with any ideas about that,but surely Spielberg would have to be the director.",The Ten Commandments
262,amadeuswashere-1,10 Commandments - what no one can ever keep,6,19 March 2005,"I'm watching on TV, the old ""10 commandments"" -- haven't seen it since I was very young. I'm most attracted to this movie for Charlton Heston, because he is so HOT. Yul Brynner that bald man? No way.. Chuckie is the hot one! This is the most overacted, dramatic, historically and religiously incorrect and massively flawed piece o' garbage I've ever witnessed. I'm laughing a lot.. it plays out like an elementary school play..I cannot believe the logic that the first born sons of Egypt would die and that this is ""Gods desire"".I suppose if people believed that this is the ""desire"" of a God, they would never question it, but its actually so unrealistic and cruel.I would love to tell you how it ends, but it came out in the 50's. lolBut hot damn that CHARLTON! WOOHOO.. sizzle!!!!",The Ten Commandments
263,mofester2003,God of Commercialism is more powerful,10,17 April 2006,"From watching all of the commercial interruptions during the broadcast I was thinking how the God of Commercialism is today's most powerful god. The God in the Ten Commandments, ""I am,"" was indeed very powerful in his day but times have changed and commercial ads rule the ""I am"" deity. Audiences have to sit through ads of the new ruling God to get time to see tidbits of the ""I AM"" God and his prophet, Moses or another broadcast of another God or prophet. 1. Does anyone know the name of the ruling God of Commercialism? 2. What does this God look like? 3. Is it a masculine or feminine deity or both? 4. What are the commandments of the God of Commercialism? (I assume it is to view it's divinely sponsored ads and to buy products).",The Ten Commandments

265,kayceejones,So much disappointment...,1,28 August 2015,"I was looking forward to watching a great classic when I popped in, ""The Ten Commandments,"" but it looks like I came to the wrong place.The movie is dreadfully boring, and the plot is filled with ludicrous love triangles.I know it was the 50's, but I just had a hard time believing some old white guy as the original Pharoah. Really...all the white people.... so many white people.Worst of all, this film is an insult to the people and history it claims to depict. This film is as historically based on the life of Moses as ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter"" was about Abraham Lincoln. If you're not familiar with the story the movie is based on, you're likely to walk away with a large number of misconceptions. Four hours is too great a sacrifice for this flick.",The Ten Commandments
266,rproger,Could have been and should have been,3,15 April 2017,Could have been a great movie and should have been a great movie. But Charleton Hestons over acting just spoils this movie. It is painful to watch. Sure we all have our opinions and that's just mine but wow! One the other hand Yul Brenner as always was very good. Terrible direction by what is otherwise a great director but to try to make a movie and surround it with a ''halo'' so to speak was a big mistake.,The Ten Commandments

268,nafiura,It has endured time,10,17 April 2017,"I have learned through the years to remit myself to facts. The Ten Commandments has been shown on ABC for almost 35 years .....most of the times beating all the other spectacles shown at the same time . It has become an Easter tradition . And this last year (2017) , it has been seen by 20 % more people than last year . The highest audience in the last seven years ! So .................what does this mean ? Just one thing ...........it is indisputably a movie people loves ........and there must be something to it for this to happen after more than 60 years....... Conclusion , who are we to judge works of art that have endured time ? We may like Ten Commandments better than other movies ,or not , just as we prefer some paintings or sculptures to others ..............but in the long run.............it is the public s acceptance ......and time who decide what is worthy or not.
