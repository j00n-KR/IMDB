0,Leofwine_draca,Home Alone for gorehounds,5,22 June 2015,"THE COLLECTOR is a middling torture porn-based horror flick with an absolutely ridiculous story. The premise is just as nonsensical as in BURNING BRIGHT - you know, the film about a girl and her little brother trapped in a house with a TIGER - but even more so due to its complexity. The story sees a burglar entering the house of a rich family in the middle of the night, only to discover a crazed killer has set up home and filled the house with deadly traps.It makes no sense and there's no attempt to try to rationalise or explain things. Instead we embark on a horror-themed journey in which death and bodily mutilation are the order of the day. The plotting is very slim and the characters even slimmer, with the supporting cast merely set up as cannon fodder for the admittedly creepy villain.What I disliked about this film was the dark blue filter which gives it a boring, uniform look, and the lack of lighting means that you'll be straining your eyes throughout. Given this was made by people coming off the SAW franchise, the icky effects are very much along those lines; I'm indifferent to them. THE COLLECTOR has a fast pace going for it but there are too many contrivances to make it a truly effective horror piece.",The Collector
1,SnoopyStyle,Saw wannabe,5,27 October 2013,"The Collector is a sadistic killer who takes over a home, tortures the family, and kidnaps one person in his giant trunk. The Chases (Michael Reilly Burke, Andrea Roth, Karley Scott Collins, Madeline Zima) have just moved in to their nice house. Arkin (Josh Stewart) is the handyman. He is desperate for money to pay back his wife's debt to loan shark. So he breaks into the Chase house while the family is away. The problem is the Collector has other plans.This thing has more plot problems than 10 Michael Bay movies. Why the collector would plant such elaborate traps in the house is beyond me. Where would he even find the time? If one is willing to drop the logic, this could be seen as a different take on the Saw franchise. It's overly elaborate for no reason. But unlike Saw, the whole thing is one simple action away from total collapse. At his best, the Collector can never be sure of his control. He keeps getting interrupted by people coming in. Simply put, he's bad at his work.If I forget all the complaints. The action is pretty good. The actors are great. The kills are fun. It's a good way to waste 90 minutes for horror fans.",The Collector
2,claudio_carvalho,"Stupid, Gruesome, Sick and Flawed",3,4 May 2010,"When the Chase family moves to an isolated house in the middle of nowhere in Detroit, Arkin (Josh Stewart) is hired to fix the windows and the doors. Later he meets his daughter and his wife that has a debt with dangerous sharks and needs money, but his week payment is not enough to pay her debts. Arkin plots to heist the safe of Michael Chase (Michael Reilly Burke) during the night to raise the necessary money. However, when he arrives in the house, he finds that a sadistic criminal has imprisoned the family and planted traps everywhere. Arkin seeks a way out of the deadly house to save his life. ""The Collector"" is a stupid, gruesome and sick flick of a violent and sadistic sub-genre of horror that is becoming popular for some viewers. The story is flawed, incoherent and imbecile, and surprisingly this movie is overrated in IMDb and with good reviews, some of them visibly fake by simpleton users with only one review in IMDb. There many incoherent and ridiculous situations like, for example, how could the Collector put all those gadgets and traps in the house in a couple of hours with the family at home; or when Arkin succeeds in leaving the house but returns to rescue Hannah in an absurd attitude; or why Hannah decides to show up only when Arkin is outside the house; or how the police officer could be surprised by the dog having a gun in his hand; or how could the invulnerable Collector survive to the chandelier with knives and then attack the ambulance. I believe I could prepare a long list of foolish and idiotic attitudes. The cinematography is above average and the music score with Bauhaus is very dark. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""O Colecionador de Corpos"" (""The Collector of Corpses"")",The Collector
3,nogodnomasters,THE BOX OR WHAT'S BEHIND DOOR NUMBER 1?,7,27 September 2018,"Arkin (Josh Stewart) who looks too much like Sean Penn is an ex-con, handy man, second story man, and a safe cracker who loves his 8 year old daughter.

4,kosmasp,Pieces,6,26 September 2010,"The movie has a very strong beginning. But when you get to the end (or maybe even very early on into the movie), you will realize that there are quite a few flaws in this movie. There might some elaborate ideas involved, but you can't help but wonder why? Especially because there are just so many easier ways to get what you need. On the other hand you could also say, that there might be no way, that someone who is crazy can know that.Of course this is a horror movie (the tag on the cover/poster should be a giveaway) and so you will have quite a few bloody scenes in the movie (I think it is not yet available, completely uncut in Germany), so you should know that this is not so much a psychological movie (a bit too), but more a movie about violence. Question is, do you really want to watch that? You could talk about an ""overkill"" of an idea, but that pun would be too easy. And in the end, it's not completely bad ... I just wished it had stayed with the strong beginning",The Collector
5,gavin6942,Under-appreciated and Misunderstood,7,7 May 2010,"A man named Arkin needs quick cash. Lucky for him, he recently began work at a home with a safe that he can break into. Not so lucky for him, on the night he decides to do this, a serial killer known as The Collector has decided to target the same house. Arkin is now both predator and prey.I feel this film was simply under-appreciated and misunderstood. Lots of fans have complained of the lack of plot and senseless violence. One reviewer even says, ""Kevin set up better traps in Home Alone"" (which may be true). But the lack of plot is more because of the confusing nature of the story than any real lack of substance.I spoke with Patrick Melton, the writer, and while I already enjoyed the film (in many ways it beats the ""Saw"" series Melton also developed) his explanation of the Collector's motives made it more enjoyable. Some viewers do not understand why the traps exist... well, you have to understand that the Collector plays with his victims -- his goal is not to kill them, necessarily.Others have been more favorable, referring to the film's cinematography and ""80s aesthetic"". I agree. You can tell many instances where Marcus Dunstan was meticulous with his shots. Pay attention to how many quick half-second shots were probably added in later, filmed a dozen times to be perfect. A casual viewer will not see this, but the critic will appreciate the art.If you missed ""The Collector"" in theaters, get the DVD or Blu-Ray. I have a suspicion that when ""Collector 2"" appears, there will be a new-found appreciation for this original conception -- thrills, blood, gore, mystery... much deeper than it first appears.",The Collector
6,BA_Harrison,"It's got more plot-holes than bear traps and fish hooks added together, but I still enjoyed it.",7,3 June 2010,"An ex-con, desperate to help pay his ex-wife's debts, breaks into the seemingly deserted house of his employer, only to find that he isn't alone: a twisted nut-job in a gimp mask has taken the owner and his wife captive and has littered the building with deadly traps.The masked killer in The Collector has got to be one of the most organised and productive psychos in movie history. In one evening, he not only takes prisoner and tortures a married couple, but he also finds time to install numerous booby traps in their mansion, ranging from simple 'bear traps on the living room floor' to the more complex 'accidentally touch this filament and a chuffing great blade will swing down and cause you much pain'. I don't know about you, but it takes me the best part of a day to put up a bloody shelf.The thing that really puzzles me, though, is why he bothers with all of these devices in the first place since he's already trapped most of the family (the youngest daughter is hiding in one of the many rooms), and the oldest daughter (played by buxom babe Madeline Zima, who kindly provides the requisite topless scene) surely wouldn't represent much of a problem when she returns from her evening out with her boyfriend. Still, without the traps there wouldn't be much of a film, and since I had a lot of fun watching the characters meet their gruesome fates via various ingenious means, I'm willing to be a little forgiving about both lack of logic and motive.It's clear that what matters most to director Marcus Dunstan is not explaining why and how his killer does what he does, but rather that his film creates a palpable sense of dread—which it does—and that people die horribly— which they do. Dunstan successfully builds a decent amount of suspense and atmosphere and sure doesn't hold back on the graphic stuff, delivering plenty of moments that'll be particularly uncomfortable viewing for the more squeamish of movie-goers: amongst the gory treats we get a delightfully bloody death by bear-trap, a disembowelled body, finger chopping, impalement on spikes, fish hooks in the face, a mouth being sewn closed, and a cat slowly dissolved in acid before being sliced in half!And since there's nothing quite like a half-melted moggy being bisected by a window rigged with a guillotine, I'm happy to—despite the flaws in the narrative—rate The Collector a pretty decent 6.5/10, rounded up to 7/10 for IMDb.",The Collector
7,Quinoa1984,"starts strong, but goes downhill after a while",4,10 February 2010,"I was bamboozed by The Collector! I give this exclamation point to try, with whatever sway or effect my words may have on you, that this is not some crime/horror movie hybrid. This is its premise, which is really all needs to be said of its 'story': laborer Arkin (Josh Stewart) has to pull a jewel heist from his employer so that he can help his (ex?)-wife pay off a loan shark, not knowing that the house he's re-entering in at night has been completely rigged with traps and 'gotcha' devices by a twisted f*** in black leather (think if the Gimp had a blood transfusion with Jigsaw's retarded cousin). That's all the movie is, after this, traps and torture and gore and predictable set-ups where one knows, at least with some certainly, the wee witte girl won't die. The filmmakers aren't *that* hardcore, are they?"" Fat chance of invention here.Oh, don't get me wrong, they do try, at least on the surface. The cinematography carries a slight gritty neo-noir look in the opening minutes, speaking to an open-minded audience member ""Ok, the acting isn't very good except in a hollow-eyed way Stewart, but the set-up has a little promise, perhaps"", and even once Arkin is in the house the first-time DoP Brandon Cox does try to give the film a punch with its jaundiced look. But aside from that... there's not much here, at all. It doesn't have the silly unintentional laughs that one gets from watching the Saw movies when they're at the most fun-bad, and it doesn't even have the ""oh my GOD is this a gas chamber"" like Hostel Part II.It's an anorexic plot with no explanation for anything- why the exterminator is at this house, why he keeps victims in that box, why Arkin's girl has a loan shark, why ANYTHING happens aside from the mechanics of a torture porn. And make no mistake, this is torture porn, even if it doesn't linger or have the same whiplash-style-edit fetishizing Saw has in spades. It's also rather cruel and unsettling in ways one wouldn't expect, or maybe would or should by this point. The filmmakers make great effort to make an audience feel queasy and unsettled, but never for reasons or to an effect that actually works or makes one feel satisfied. It's an empty shell of a ""horror"" movie that doesn't scare and only rubs off an ever-lasting dread that lasts long after the incredibly stupid ending comes along. The Collector grows worse in the mind as it goes along, losing whatever hope it had as merely a B-movie hybrid.",The Collector
8,Coventry,Home Alone 5: Kevin Tasted Blood!,6,12 April 2010,"Seven ""Saw"" movies, two ""Hostel"" flicks and countless of lesser known imitations later, bloodthirsty horror audiences clearly still can't get enough of the so-called torture porn movies. The latest, but surely not the last, entry in this dubious horror trend is called ""The Collector"" and offers – as to be expected – nothing new or even remotely original to the concept of torture porn, but at least somewhat distinguishes itself from the majority thanks to a handful of imaginative gory set pieces and even a few likable characters that you even cheer for. The lead character is an ex-con named Arkin who tries really to walk the righteous path by working as a handyman in the remote mansion of a wealthy family that moved to the countryside. His ex-wife has debt and mean people chasing her, however, so Arkin is practically forced to return to the mansion at night and break into the family vault. Bad move, of course, because that same night the mansion already got invaded by a psychopathic serial killer known as the Collector because he targets entire families for annihilation but keeps one of them alive to add to his collection. The killer wears a mask and never speaks a word, but if you know the cinematic classics, you'll quickly figure out who he is! He's the now adult Kevin McAllister from the ""Home Alone"" movies, and you can tell quite easily because he booby trapped the entire house with deadly devices, like a room full of wolf traps, a spider's web with steel cables and chandeliers with knives attached to them! Personally I think the biggest strongpoint of ""The Collector"" is that it unfolds like a fairly primitive ""Saw for Dummies"". The toys and booby traps Jigsaw prepares for his victims are so hi-tech, meticulous and convoluted that they becomes preposterous and absurd, whereas the killing methods of Mr. Collector are straightforward but equally effective and gruesome. Also, it's nice to have a killer who shuts up and looks sinister for a change, because the endless long and dull morality speeches of Jigsaw where beginning to get on my nerves. ""The Collector"" is a film that will definitely appeal to the insatiable nowadays horror crowd, what with its extreme gore, loud & heavy soundtrack (Depeche Mode, woo-hoo!) and gratuitous bits of nudity provided by the luscious Madeline Zima as the family's rebellious teenage daughter. The make-up effects are more than adequate and Marcus Dunstan, co-writer of ""Feast"", does a relatively fine job in his first directorial accomplishment.",The Collector
9,michaelRokeefe,High anxiety...caught in a trap.,8,5 March 2010,"If you are a fan of the SAW franchise, you'll find this movie a bit refreshing. The traps are at least not stale or cumbersome. A handyman, Arkin(Josh Stewart), needs fast money to help his estranged wife(Daniella Alonso)payoff a loan-shark. He decides his future financial freedom is at hand...he will rob his current employer while the family is on vacation. Upon entering the spacious home Arkin realizes that he is not alone. Another masked intruder is in the house and is hell bent on adding to his grisly psychotic collection. It gets pretty gruesome and there are some images that are just plain sick. Warning: your blood pressure may be elevated. The cast also includes: Michael Riley Burke, Andrea Roth, Madeline Zima, Karley Scott Collins and Juan Fernandez.",The Collector
10,Scarecrow-88,The Collector,7,14 May 2010,"A petty thief(Josh Stewart), who cases the houses he installs locks for, chooses the wrong place to stage a new safe heist as a killer has also picked it out for his own sadistic purposed. The movie, as you may have already read, is cut from the same visceral cloth as the Saw movies and it's imitators. A diabolical fiend, with a knack for setting up ingenious traps, picks certain victims, and has his way with them in very malicious ways, using their own house as his playpin.It takes preparation and planning, closing off all means of escape, setting up devious traps for those who attempt to either call for help or flee the house. It takes a really warped intellect to effectively mold such a labyrinth of traps, and we follow the thief as he moves about the house, trying to not only evade the killer but get out of the building.What I found particularly interesting was how locks, bear traps, sharp wires, and other traps appear out of nowhere as the thief goes from room to room. Amusing is how massive the house seems to be; the rooms seem limitless. And, the torture, pain, and anguish for which the psychopath inflicts on the occupants of the house he selects is pretty severe..this madman takes great pride in orchestrating the most elaborate methods of suffering imaginable. The killer's mask seems to illustrate his deranged psyche. And, his eyes are pitch black yet have a glimmer to the center that is quite unsettling.Also intriguing is the scene where the thief gets the subdued wife to scream so that the killer will be distracted as he can retrieve a gun hidden in the safe he was initially supposed to rob, and how he doesn't exactly hurry to rescue them, securing items of monetary potential, and going through dresser drawers looking for valuable goods! Oh, what does the sicko collect? It's more like who...The filmmakers decide to show the aftermath of the psychopath's grisly activity rather than linger on the unpleasantness..and when there is violence in a scene, it's shot in a way not to dwell on what it taking place, using sound effects and our imagination to fill in the details, such as a cat's demise and the removal of a tongue..also notice how we do not see the knife inserted into a victim's torso multiple times, but the look on her face as she is being stabbed. The sound design(breaking glass, creaking steps/wood, knives and their amazing ability to make a noise even when placed back in the killer's holster, the simmering of acid on a floor as it burns shoes, the cat, and books used to walk on)is of the greatest importance to the filmmakers who depend on what we hear to develop terror in our minds. During the walk-throughs in the house, the camera points out where tools of destruction are located, hid from those inside(except, curious enough, the thief who often just misses being a victim himself)yet established to us so we can squirm since we know something the characters aren't aware of. I guess something particularly disconcerting to the viewer might be that the thief never is capable of saving those he intends to help, with the killer seeming to gain an upper hand each and every time..because, we must remember that he wants to stay alive as well and so the thief often fails to halt the ensuing madness. To wit, when it seems the thief is on the verge of rescuing someone they make irrational decisions, stumbling into a trap or the killer himself. Our thief takes his share of lumps..fish hooks to the face and a razor blade to his hand(his bloody hands leave marks throughout the walls of the house). If I make it sound like THE COLLECTOR doesn't deliver the grisly goods, I'd like to state that it more than satisfies in that department, a head is used to bash open a locked door, a victim falls into a barrage of bear traps after his fingers are clipped off by scissors, the results of a man gutted upside down and a mouth is sewn shut(not to mention, we see what nails and large steel hooks do to the human body). And, to put the icing on the cake, the killer has his own ferocious mutt which rips the throat out of a policeman.Quite simply put, THE COLLECTOR is not for those easily disturbed by devious behavior(or who get queasy when metal damages flesh) . I'll close by saying, ""My, my, my, Madeline Zima, oh how you have grown up, you little sex kitten.""",The Collector
11,Hey_Sweden,"Silly stuff, but enjoyable just the same.",7,15 March 2012,"One thing must be stated right up front: audiences who get turned off by rampant ridiculousness will more than likely find ""The Collector"" too absurd to really enjoy. There's no denying it: this is an insane, over the top exercise in cruelty and sadism, which one really shouldn't take seriously. Writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan are veterans of the ""Feast"" and ""Saw"" franchises (and Dunstan debuts as director), so we know going in we're going to get a pervasively grim atmosphere and a lot of splatter that will make gore loving horror fans happy. Likable Josh Stewart ('Third Watch', 'Dirt', 'No Ordinary Family') plays Arkin, an ex convict who needs to come up with a lot of money to get a loan shark off his ex-wife's back. He knows how to do it: steal a gem from the house where he's been working as a handyman. Only problem is the timing just stinks. When he returns to the house he finds that a brutal predator (Juan Fernandez) has already invaded the house, rigged it with all sorts of brutal booby traps, and been terrorizing the family. So now the more or less decent guy Arkin is in the unlikely position of saving the lives of the people he was going to rob. Dunstan delivers so much nastiness that the result is rather comedic, albeit in a very dark fashion. It's too hard not to laugh at some points, although there are others where one can wince in sympathy at something happening to a character. Mostly, though, the victims - a husband / dad, wife / mom, and teen aged daughter, are so stupid that one can't help but feel they deserve what they get. Give Dunstan credit for just diving head first into his tale of horror; pacing certainly isn't an issue. Credibility is the issue, but if people are willing to suspend a lot of disbelief, ""The Collector"" is a fine visceral entertainment. The villain himself is a very sinister one; veteran actor Fernandez, who's often specialized in bad guy roles (playing Charles Bronson's nemesis in ""Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects"", for example), adds another creepy role to his resume. Other familiar faces include Diane Ayala Goldner, who was in all of the ""Feast"" movies, William Prael, who was in two of them, Madeline Zima, the little girl from 'The Nanny' TV series all grown up, Robert Wisdom (""The Forgotten""), who has an undeniable presence as a crime lord, and Daniella Alonso (""The Hills Have Eyes 2"", ""Wrong Turn 2: Dead End""), so some of the cast is certainly experienced at genre fare. Overall, this movie is a true hoot and a half, with some priceless grisly gags, although the ending is too cynically predictable. Still...it's anything but boring. Seven out of 10.",The Collector
12,dbborroughs,"Better than the recent Saw films, I was disappointed that this seems to be just another set up for a similar horror series",5,16 August 2009,"From the writer of several of the Saw films comes what maybe the start of yet another series (I hope not). This is the story of guy who puts in security systems. When his ex-wife runs into financial trouble with some bad people he decides to rob the home of his latest client. Unfortunately the title character already has staked out the house and he must not only rescue himself, but the family inside. Gory violent film is better than the recent Saw films but at the same time it just misses the mark. Give the film points for shaking things up not going for the typical madman on the loose story, but take many more away for the over done nature and an ending that promises more films. I was kind of liking this until I realized that there was more to go and that the ending really wasn't. Horror fans with a love of maniacs on the loose are directed towards the film, others are steered away.

He maneuvers around the traps in a vain effort to escape.There are plenty of surprises along the way to keep up your interest, and a final surprise that indicates a possible Collector II.It's worth the time if you are a thriller fan, just be aware that the director and writer did the Feast trilogy and Saw IV, V, VI, and 3D.As an added bonus, you get to see how little Grace Sheffield from ""The Nanny"" is all grown up.",The Collector
14,neil-476,Unrealised potential,7,30 June 2010,"I went into this movie knowing nothing about it and, for a while, I had high hopes. It starts with an unnerving sequence of a couple arriving home to a power outage and finding a luggage trunk in their bedroom which, when opened, leads to screaming and I'm-not-quite-sure-what. Then, after the titles, we meet a crew of assorted handymen, builders etc. who are working on a house owned by a dad, mum, teenage daughter and pre-teen daughter, who are about to leave on vacation. One of the workers, Arkin (Josh Stewart) is both creepy and sympathetic at the same time, and generates a feeling of unease in the audience. We then discover that his wife owes a large amount to loan sharks, that Arkin has criminal connections, and that he intends to burgle the house he has been working on in order to get the money necessary to pay the loan sharks.So far so good - we have intriguing story elements, a sense of unease, and a sense of suspense. Unfortunately, when the burglary begins, the whole thing falls down. Arkin stumbles into a situation where an unknown psycho has set multiple traps up throughout the house, and a series of Saw-style torture episodes ensues with Arkin becoming the reluctant would-be saviour of the captive family. It's all rather familiar, and done perfectly satisfactorily in its own way, but another torture-porn movie falls short of the interesting developments promised by the opening 20 minutes or so.And the ending irritated me. This would have been an ideal opportunity for the psycho to have actually got his comeuppance. But no, the completely expected unexpected twist took place, leaving Arkin's wife's loan shark plot thread unresolved but (of course) leaving the way open for The Collector II.This is not to say that there isn't stuff to enjoy here. The cinematography is excellent, suspense is well maintained in a claustrophobic setting, and Madeline Zima as daughter Jill displays some impressive bosoms.But it could all have been so much better.",The Collector

However, when he arrives in the house, he finds that a sadistic criminal has imprisoned the family and planted traps everywhere.....when the credits rolled, i thought that this was going to be another rehash of se7en or even the glimmer man.What i got was one of the most sadistic, scary hidden gems i have found in a very long time.To compare the premise would be to compare the narrative to Psycho, man goes to to do one thing (make money) and find himself in a whole new world and scenario.The set up is okay, it gets a little boring at the thirty minute mark, but then it goes in a way that one cannot describe. It has been compared to Saw, which in some ways, is justified, But Jigsaw had some rationale, whereas the titular character hasn't. as one victim says 'he just likes you' which makes the film all the more un-nerving.it's not horror, it's too weird for that, the mask gets taken off, but we never see the face, and animals get killed in a way you cannot imagine.The soundtrack id great, not at first, like i said, the opening credits really remind you of se7en, but later on, it reminds one of the final third of 8mm, where the soundtrack really owned the scene.there are some really graphic scenes, but the film really comes into it's own in the final twenty minutes.if you are a fan of this kind of film, go for it, it will surprise, if not, complain away!!",The Collector
16,trashgang,brutal suspense,6,15 April 2010,"Just when you thought, not another SAW one again, they came with this flick. To be honest, to call it a horror I can't really agree. It's just like The Punisher, it's brutal and gory too. I would call it a gory thriller. We all have seen films were someone breaks into your house and things get wrong but this one has a special threat. A burglar in a house notices that he isn't alone. There is some one else, a kind of, what's in a name, Jigsaw. A collector, of humans. The storyline is okay, but the score was what attracted me the most, carefully searched songs and when The Collector appears, you here voices screaming. Suddenly the script changes into the brutal, gory stuff. All been done in a effective way. For me what's still not clear are the spiders. Anyway, it does remind you of the torture porn, Saw and Hostel. Still at the end you don't know why and who The Collector is. So if you are in for a good suspense and you can take some torture then this is surely recommended. Up to the moment it isn't available here in Europe but I guess it will be cut for some reason. Just collect the DVD/blu ray...",The Collector
17,KineticSeoul,Watchable and entertaining to a degree but just not all that satisfying,7,14 April 2013,"Watching this movie was like watching a ""Home Alone"" horror movie. Except a person that invades the house is the one that is setting up traps. Well the first person that invades the house. And the traps are much more vicious and deadly than the ones in ""Home Alone"". The plot is basically about a thief that invades a house in order to save his family, because him and his loved ones are in a critical situation because of a group of gangsters he had relations with. But someone else invaded the house before him. Although this is a bit of a slasher genre. What stands out is the fact that the killer kills people with traps inside a house instead of just a weapon in hand. This movie gets pretty darn gritty especially with it's torture scene. But not enough to be a exploitation film. It's a entertaining movie to a degree but just isn't all that satisfying. Especially with it's ending. I don't know I just don't really like these endings where a guy that is going down a wrong path tries to do the right thing for once and gets screwed over completely. But than again that can sort of apply to real life as well. Plus because of the ending in this, it leaves room for a sequel. It's good slasher/horror flick and does have it's moments. Especially when the thief uses stealth and even throws-down and fights back during some scenes. And it's a watchable and entertaining movie to a degree, just isn't all that satisfying after it's finished.7/10",The Collector
18,thesar-2,Collect something worthy,2,28 June 2010,"I yearn for any movie, drama, comedy or even slasher/torture-porn flick, to contain character depth, originality and a present and background well thought out – as well as scenes, and I got all of it in The Collector.For a measly hour and 29 minutes, you will get one of the most unique, well shot, wonderfully directed, believable acting and overall executed of all horror films. And for all that, I will award a flat ½ star above the lowest rating possible: 1 star.The Collector makes Chucky, Jason, Michael and Freddy look like wimps. The Collector makes Pinhead and even Leatherface look like pansies. And The Collector makes Jigsaw look as amateurish as a first-year film school dropout. This, my peers, is thee most grotesque, disgusting, repulsive, vile and reason-for-a-cold-shower movie I have ever seen. For that, I will highly recommend the movie to be AVOIDED.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Yes, it has qualities I appreciate in movies – more than you'll ever know, and yes, for the most part, it was well made. And furthermore, I truly understand when someone describes a movie of such a despicable nature as a movie you should steer away from, you'll yearn to see it more. Heck, I do the same thing when people tell me to stop smoking or drinking – it only makes the rebel inside me want to do it more.

The reason for such violence portrayed kept escalating so much, as if the director/writer wanted so bad to not only top all other torture-porn's prior, but himself in the process, that I finally had to scream out at the screen: ""Oh, come on! Really?!? Give me a freakin' break!""True – I did shout all that out, because, there's a point that it just gets, well, just too much. Now, this didn't happen in the film, but for the inevitable sequel – which I will avoid at all costs – you might as well tie down an innocent 7-year-old girl and cut off one finger at a time while injecting her with whatever medicine in an I.V. to keep her both alive and conscious to ""take some more punishment."" Lord, forgive me for having such horrible thoughts, but that's what this movie is like.If this kind of awfulness is your cup of tea, I will feel for you. Never before have I seen such an abomination to humankind, to morals or to sanity. I would give them credit for doing what they set out to: make Satan proud.I'm no prude. I love horror. Even the slasher genre. Heck, I felt the first three Saw films were well crafted with decent acting, originality and suspense. I'm a life-long Jason, Michael and Freddy compadre. I enjoyed the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (and its remakes.) I've even sat through the original Hostel and Wolf Creek.To drive my point this movie needs to be avoided: The Collector had its major plot holes. Apparently, within a period of hours or less, this masked Person Under the Stairs S&M villain set up enough ""traps"" to make Nancy Thompson want to take lessons. In addition, the killer can navigate through these wires and trips with the ease of an Ocean's Eleven thief or ballerina at the drop of a hat. Also, the leather he's wearing only allows some sounds, because the true burglar can make as much noise as he wants to alert the next county over, yet go undetected in the stereotypical creaky house.So, even if you get past the actually good set –up with enough plot intrigue to fill a series of mystery films, and the homage to torture, you'll have to suspend your disbelief and almost laugh at the most inappropriate times.Oh. I forgot the obligatory part of my review where I mention the plot. Well-to-do craftsman Arkin (Stewart) is scoping out the place of his employment – an unfinished house in Timbuktu – in order to steal from it later in the night so his ex can get money for her loan-shark while helping their daughter. (Mouthful.) Wait, there's more! Someone ""collects"" humans and is also watching the place. And, the target family with the clichéd daughters – one rebellious and one young and innocent – are supposed to be away on a family holiday, but they stick around to, well, eventually stick around.Does the plot matter? They think so, and I do admire them (again – only ½ a star worth) for putting some effort into this blood bath. But, beyond a reasonable doubt this movie was based on one subject and one only: How far can they go to shock the audience or upset even the most experienced horror-fan? Spoiler here: the ending had plenty of opportunities to redeem most of the movie. Not only did it fail at the extremely unoriginal climax (or final 5 minutes,) but it left no good-will at all. Sure, I know the context of the film (or mood) but give me a freakin' bone already. I needed something to remind myself I'm still a human being.Heck, I would give it kudos for ending on a fraction of a positive note, but they had to go for the obvious, never-minding what they had in store was completely unrealistic.Please for the love of GOD, skip this movie. I hate to say it but if you're a fan of this movie, I would have trouble being your friend. At very least: I would watch my back.",The Collector
19,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Intriguing set up, but descends into little more than common torture porn",4,18 November 2010,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The first thing you notice with The Collector is the funny style of camera lens used from the off set. It gives the film a distinctive look that isn't expected, but which makes it look unique and does give it a weird air of mystery, even if the story does play out in the expected fashion. But this air is not maintained and it soon descends into the sort of generic torture porn that has come to embody modern horror. And particularly grisly, barbaric and brutal it is too, meaning that even for a horror film, this is just a seriously unpleasant ride. **",The Collector
20,callanvass,I'll give this an A for effort. It has a lot going for it to make this well worth seeing,6,4 September 2013,"I've been a fool. I tried watching this a few years ago, and couldn't finish it. That inkling to give it another go just wouldn't go away. Well. Guess what? Not only did I watch the whole movie, but I wound up digging it for the most part! The comparisons to the Saw franchise are apt, I suppose. But the Saw series started to become redundant. The Collector is much more than just another cash-in attempt to make some coin. Director Marcus Dunstain clearly had a vision with this one. The killer in this one is not someone that asks questions. Jigsaw was a nasty individual as well, but he had a motive for doing what he was doing, a reason if you will. The Collector (Creepily played by Juan Fernandez) just likes to hurt people. He's gleefully psychotic and kills people in the most sickening ways imaginable for his own demented pleasures. There is no background on this guy, and that makes him all the more terrifying. In some ways that could have worked against it, but I didn't feel it was needed here, and added to the atmosphere. The gore scenes deliver. I won't spoil them, but gore hounds will be replenished for their thirst. My only real carps are I wish the finale went on a tad longer, and that is was hard to make out what was going in a couple scenes because I had trouble seeing. It was a bit too dark. William Prael plays for a very good reluctant hero. His desperation had me rooting for him. I enjoyed him a lotFinal Thoughts: Sometimes a second viewing does wonders. It sure did with the Collector. It's not perfect, but it's a highly suspenseful thrill ride that lacks the budget of a Saw, but is arguably better than a lot of the Saw sequels. Recommended.

Now, it's up to Arkin to save the remaining family members and escape the booby-trapped abode before the cloaked collector (Juan Fernandez) can add them to his creepy catalogue.Though it has all the makings of a horror franchise, including a malicious main character with a stockpile of subterfuges, The Collector, unfortunately, is too late to the already beleaguered torture-horror genre.As for how to avoid becoming an item of interest to a fanatical collector of individuals, simply remove yourself from your original packaging.

The story is original and it will keep you entertained and most of all guessing. It has a great claustrophobic atmosphere. The film gets into the action very quickly. The film has a true dreadful feeling as the trapped burglar Arkin played convincingly by Josh Stewart (The hunted, Law abiding citizen) tries his best to save the family and escape. Stewart gives the character depth and emotion. Marcus Dunstans direction is excellent as he admirably builds up the tension and suspense. He is the writer of Saw 4, 5, 6 n 7, Feast 1, 2, 3 n Piranha 3DD. The traps are some of the best to date. This movie is very scary and intense and well acted. The camera work is excellent and the film comes across as extremely dark and claustrophobic.

Not to everyone's taste and without great performances,7,3 February 2013,"After lengthy credits and unnecessarily long prologue, the hell gets loose in the huge housing. At first, it is almost a silent movie with horrifying background noises and music, then cat-and-mouse play becomes more intensive. Tense and horror are mostly present and comprehensible, some scenes could have be shorter though... The ending (for some reason or other, between credits) leads viewers to an imminent sequel - which was created last year. In fact, I saw The Collection prior to The Collector and, in my opinion, the sequel is slightly better - due to more people fighting with the maniac. The movie in question is virtually an one-man-show. As for the cast, it is rather mediocre, apart from the leading performer Josh Stewart perhaps; but Karley Scott Collins as Hannah is not plausible at all...

27,jadavix,"A low-rent ""Saw"" knock-off",6,13 July 2018,"It's hard to know what to say about a movie like ""The Collector"", because it can be summed up so briefly.

He breaks in there, but finds another criminal has already visited the place and filled it with traps.That's basically it.The comparison to the ""Saw"" movies, I feel, is going to be unfavourable from most people in the audience, because the traps in this one aren't nearly as creative.One weird detail is that the shiny-eyed, masked serial killer in the movie is played by Juan Fernandez, the Dominican actor who Charles Bronson attempted to make eat his own watch in the sleaze classic ""Kinjite"".

However, upon entering the house he finds that someone else has beaten him to the job and worse still this assailant has rigged the house with several deadly traps...The comparison to Saw with this film are inevitable and the fact that it was written by the same people who wrote some of the Saw films will also come as no surprise. The Collector plays out as a cross between Saw and pretty much any modern home-invasion film that you happen to stumble upon. The one drawback with this film is that it lacks the intelligence of the Saw films (I'm talking more about the earlier films) - there's no expansive story explaining away the motivations of our 'trap setter' like there was in the Saw films which may disappoint those that are looking for some kind of depth. However...What The Collector does benefit from is an almost nail biting kind of suspense (this more-or-less) starts from the moment Arkin enters the house until the end of the film. The traps that are set are mostly original and don't merely copy from those that we witnessed in the Saw films and like with the Saw films some of the torture that the Collector puts his victims through are quite brutal so viewer discretion is definitely advised. It's certainly intense and claustrophobic which is exactly what a home invasion film should be and it did have me on the edge of my seat quite a lot.Director Marcus Dunstan (looking at his previous credits) clearly knows what he's doing and uses sound and various camera techniques to give the film a very professional edge - one wonders if he's been talking to James Wan who is also brilliant at making these type of films and presumably acted as Dunstan's main infleunce.If I was to levy any criticism against this film then it lies with our Jigsaw wannabe; we don't really learn why he does what he does? Was there a point to it or is he just sadistic? I believe there is a sequel to this film so perhaps it gets addressed there, but aside from this there isn't an awful lot wrong with this film.In summary whilst it shares similarities with Saw (more specifically the first film) it isn't quite as clever and lacks narrative depth, but it is suspenseful and nerve-wracking and will provide plenty of thrills and spills for the right audience",The Collector
30,a_baron,The Collector,2,7 April 2016,"This is a familiar theme, bad guy in the house doing bad things and the damsel doing her best to outfox him. There is a slight twist here because rather than just a damsel there is another bad guy turned hero. Well, he isn't such a bad guy, he's burglarising the place out of necessity - his wife is in deep debt to the mob, and he needs the money for her. Clearly he's done this sort of thing before, burglarising, not saving the day, and when he effects entry he stumbles onto a bloodbath. Obviously it's a big house, the damsel is the youngest daughter of the man he has just been working for. Got that? Good, because the rest of it is too silly for words.Okay, if you are into special effects, you might get something out of seeing fingers chopped off and the like, and if you are into pure sadism, better to live it vicariously than do it for real, but the house is boobytrapped to such an extent you'd have to ask if a dozen people could have done this in the time allotted rather than just one.

This is a horror movie that's not for everyone though, because of how graphic and realistic it is at times. The actors are well cast and I think they do a great job with their roles. The main character had just enough depth and backstory for the audience to care about what happens to him. I liked the set up for how the house and everything was set up. The house was basically rigged as one giant death trap by the antagonist, the collector. The thrill factor is very high. In my opinion, this movie is far more thrilling and anxiety inducing than it is scary. I wasn't all that scared by it, but it did cause me to be on the edge of my seat. If you're looking for a good thrilling horror movie that is well acted, then I would suggest this one. I have not seen the sequel, the collection, but I plan on it. I'm interested to see where they take it, I'm hoping it picks up right where this film leaves off.

The rich family (dad, mom, teenage daughter, young daughter) plan on leaving that evening for a trip, although the teenage daughter refuses. Arkin has a wife with whom things aren't going so well and a young daughter as well. His wife needs money to pay loan sharks by midnight. Arkin is also a thief. He is planning on robbing the millionaire house and stealing a huge rough diamond, which he'll sell to a strip joint owner.But as his wife's deadline with the loan shark advances, Arkin decides to do the theft that night. While he's working on the safe he hears steps, and suddenly most of the house is turned into a trap: fishing wire, fishhooks, nails sticking out of the floor and walls, knives hanging from lamps, and bear traps. All the windows have been barricaded and the doors have half a dozen locks.At first his aim is to get out alive but then he finds the rich guy and his wife who are being tortured by the collector- a slender villain all in black, with a black shiny mask and with dog-cataracts, his eyes always glow green. At some point the teenage daughter arrives with a guy and they fool around in the kitchen. Eventually Arkin finds the little girl, too, and aims to save her.This is a by-the-numbers gory thriller complete with razor-thin characters, incompetent cops, explosive conclusions, predictable surprises at the end. It does have the same mood of Saw: empty- it's just about seeing a bunch of traps work. The difference is while the Saw villain is downright annoying with his non-stop Pinhead-rip-off monologues, here the bad guy is completely silent- which just adds to the sense of nothingness of this movie, not to mention that we learn nothing about the villain and his motivations. The title of this movie refers to the fact that the killer collects his favorite victims, but this isn't developed either. This movie has a very odd element and that is music playing over the dialogue. In general, the music is good, sharp, tense, electronic, no awful orchestration. But for some reason it is near non-stop. And it does not stop when characters are speaking.Overall, the movie is mediocre. I can't think of a whole lot of reasons to see it. The couple of good things are some death scenes which are OK, there are some interesting traps, but not a whole lot. There are a few seconds of nudity.

Then I discovered I'd seen The Collection (2012), a diabolical assault upon a nightclub, from memory, one to rival Saw. It was an easy enough mistake, as both Collector and Collection have almost identical dvd covers. I've just watched The Collector. WOW! Eat your heart out Saw, as Collector is more thrilling, just as diabolical, and just a tad crueler, the essential difference being that the perpetrator in Saw is something of a 'justice vigilante', whereas The Collector's fiend is just plain evil.

35,Matt_Layden,Throw Plausibility Out The Door,6,19 May 2010,"When a thief enters a house he was working construction at, he is under the impression he will be stealing a diamond. He has debts to pay off. When he enters he notices that there is someone else in the house too, an insane serial killer. He's known as The Collector. It becomes a cat and mouse game between the two.Very interesting take on the genre. Two bad guys in a house, one more evil than the other of course, but interesting nonetheless. What would have made this film better for me is if they ditched the thief aspect and had the lead be another serial killer. Then we have two serial killers trying their hardest to best the other in their own sick and twisted ways. Alas, this is not that film. Though I give the film props for having a main character with some brains. A lot of people are comparing the film to the SAW series, that's understandable. The killer sets each room up with it's own trap. Unique and interesting traps that make you wonder how the hell he could have done it all, some of them while the thief is still in there. To enjoy this film I had to throw plausibility out the door. You should too, otherwise you might be frustrated. I think you can guess why they call him the Collector. No need to probe that area. But why does he collect? Not really explored. I wanted to get inside this guy's head. We are never given that chance. Our lead is interesting to some degree, he makes being a down on your luck loser guy likable. Once we get into the house, pretty much everything stops from a story telling stand point and it turns into a ""how can we up ourselves in each room' scenario. The film has a somewhat 80's feel to it, revamped for today's genre. When the film should have been able to stand out on it's own, it falls. It becomes a cookie cutter follower and never stands out of the shadow of the films before it. It's a dark and depressing film too, any sense of hope is squashed and you feel rotten after the credits roll. Good job on that.Bottom line is that the real star of the film are the traps.

Let's starts with the minor problems: First of all, you get this MTV-techno-style music that plays throughout the film that annoys more than it creates suspense. Secondly, the sound mixing/effects is really awful, and I do mean awful. Okay, that's just the tip of the iceberg.The real problem of the film is the absurdity of all it. The characters' actions are absurd and stupid. The traps themselves are absurd. The film is like an insult to intelligence. Oh, and let's not forget the classic ""dog that's invisible until it attacks you."" I would really want a dog like that if it exists in real life. I could not fathom any part of the film. I also didn't find Josh Stewart's performance to be convincing at all, let alone the other actors in here.And the violence and gore is really nauseating to watch, but it's sure to satisfy the horror fans out there even though the film really isn't horrifying. Overall, there's very little that I can recommend from THE COLLECTOR. The plot is as thin as ice and there are plenty of ridiculous and laughable moments, especially an ending to top it all. THE COLLECTOR seems to be more of an exercise of displaying ""inventive"" and gruesome traps than a story with characters we'd want to root for. *sigh* The film had so much potential.",The Collector
38,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Collector""- A sharp, fast and very fun home-invasion thriller! Subversive and wicked.",8,19 May 2017,"Being a fan of horror can be a bit rough sometimes. Because on the whole... this is a fan-base that can never quite seem to completely agree on what works and what doesn't, and the in-fighting is rampant and sometimes disheartening. I think it's because ultimately horror and terror are subjective experiences. There's no one thing that scares everyone, and what might work wonders for certain audience members will feel tacky and dull to others. You see it every time a film comes out that builds some serious buzz... It will be simultaneously hailed by one side of the fan-base while being derided and ridiculed by the other. And director/co-writer Marcus Dunstan's 2009 home-invasion freak-show ""The Collector"" is certainly no exception.Having followed Dunstan's work alongside his writing collaborator Patrick Melton for some time, I went into ""The Collector"" excited to see what sort-of insanity they could cook up. And I wasn't disappointed. Wild, subversive and very wicked, I found the film to be a refreshing and endlessly entertaining trip into depravity and I absolutely adored it. And yet, just like so many other horror films I've admired, I see it to be a hotly debating and polarizing experience for many viewers. Which is a shame, because I think it's well-worth checking out. Yes, you can pick apart the film's liberal use of suspension of disbelief and sometimes cartoonish atmosphere, but what's the point? The film knows exactly what it is aiming for and is never taking itself to be a completely grounded and realistic film. It's a trip to Hell, where the worst-case scenario is playing out for the sake of entertainment and suspense.We follow ex-con Arkin (Josh Stewart), as he goes on that mythical ""one last job"" we hear about so much in the world of film. In this case, robbing the house of a wealthy jewelry dealer in order to pay- off loan-sharks that are threatening the safety of his wife and daughter. Knowing the house inside and out from his day-job there as a carpenter for renovations that are being done, Arkin sneaks back inside one night to relieve them of a precious ruby they have kept, locked away in a safe. But things aren't what they seem, and it soon becomes apparent that Arkin isn't the only one who chose this night to break in. A devious and torturous madman has broken in and is keeping the family hostage, having rigged the house with dozens of booby-traps to keep them from escaping. And so, Arkin must set out to save the family he originally intended to burgle.The game is essentially a prolonged 90-minute game of cat-and-mouse where the stakes are torture and death... and it's so much fun to watch. Director Dunstan has a knack for building suspense, and his smooth, slick camera-work helps build a tremendous amount of dread and terror. The camera often feels like a viper, ready to strike at any second, and the sense of flow and composition lends well to many breathtaking sequences of tension. The script by Dunstan and Melton is also a blast and a half, and once it gets going, it never lets up. The stakes rise with each and every passing scene, the atmosphere builds consistently from beat to beat, and the characters are all instantly defined and established with ease. I also appreciated that the duo injected some much-needed black humor into a few key sequences so that the suspense is never overpowering and doesn't lose its edge.The adversary of the film (the titular ""Collector"") is one heck of an antagonist, and makes for a great modern contemporary of classic horror villains. He's kept mysterious and vague, but also gets just enough screen time that you get a sense of personality. He's a great foe for our anti-hero Arkin to face, and I could definitely see the concept being used for an ongoing franchise, because there's great potential there. Speaking of which, Stewart makes for a compelling and both troubled but sympathetic lead. He gives Arkin a heart beneath his dark surface, and you totally believe him in the role. It's nice to see Stewart getting a starring vehicle in a major film. Supporting roles by the likes of Michael Reilly Burke, Karley Scott Collins and Robert Wisdom are also very well-played and flesh out the cast well.The only thing I can say to the film's fault is that it is very much reliant on the good-will of the audience... something that has clearly turned many off. As I brought up above, the film uses (and sometimes abuses) the concept of suspension of disbelief, and unless you're willing to give yourself over to it, you may find yourself drifting from the narrative. I personally never had a problem with it, but evidently others have. Still, beyond that, the movie is clearly striving to be one thing above all else... fun. And I think it's a lot of fun. The villain is menacing and eerie. The protagonist likable and charming. And the twists and turns and sense of dread completely enthralling. I was very engaged with the film the first time I saw it, and have revisited it several times since. And it's never gotten old. It's sharp, witty and incredibly intense. And for that, I give it a very good 8 out of 10. I'd say give it a shot, and be willing to cut it some slack. It's definitely an underrated and under-appreciated film of the genre.",The Collector

It never is good or logical. it simply is gory or terrible. Here we see all the imaginable methods of killings, and why? What is the point? The main hero is a bleary-eyed pedophile-to-be man, who is neither sensible nor sympathetic. Okay, he tries to save his family, but the way he does is not any merit again. And then, there are those traps and needles and scissors in that house - why? What for?? Any idea? Why does that all happen? Why are there so many stupid plot holes? Why they want to make a sequel?

40,PimpinAinttEasy,Relentless violence which gets boring very soon .....,4,31 March 2016,"Dear Marcus Dunstan, jeez man! I do not understand this sort of mindless gore fest without any character development or other interesting cinematic elements. It was almost as if you couldn't wait to introduce the characters and get that part out of the way so that you could start with the violence. You ought to watch some Rob Zombie movies or something.The film did start off quite well. Josh Stewart is a reasonably good actor. His interaction with the family whose house he works at and his wife were at least mildly engaging.I guess your film is not without merit. You do have your own unique style. The atmosphere cultivated by screaming and breathing of the psycho and loud background score. The staged violence as a result of many traps set in the house. But it is all pretty over the top and relentless and gets boring very soon.Best Regards, Pimpin.",The Collector
41,Stephen_A_Abell,Psychotic Home Alone Thriller,8,13 January 2017,"What you have here is a high-tension psychological thriller with horrific scenes and not a horror film as labelled. This is based in the real world and not that of the supernatural or paranormal. Though there is an air of dread throughout the film, which is very palpable at exactly the right times, thanks to the great direction. So horror fans would love this film also.This is the story of a thief, with a heart and conscience, agreeably portrayed by Josh Stewert (who I hadn't rated as a good actor before this film), and his mission to steal for his wife to help get her out of trouble, as regular work doesn't make enough money. The only trouble for Arkin is that a psychopath has also marked the family, but for a more grisly reason.This is an underrated film and largely missed film though I would highly recommend this if you like edge-of-your-seat tension as the director, Marcus Dunstan, does a splendid job building the tension from the moment Arkin breaks into the house, right to the end of the film. Not once does the tension falter or drop, unless the story dictates it.All of the actors are above average and do a great job of adding power to the film, though there are times I would like have had a little more building of the Chase family just so you cared a little more about what happens to them. Though to keep it to the one and a half hour runtime the writers, Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, do a good job of making the Chase family come out as ""Normal"" though.The one and only drawback to the whole movie, and the reason for the low score is The Collectors traps. These are ingenious and deadly by conception and utilisation. But just by their design, there wouldn't have been any way to set all the traps without the house-holders knowledge. Should they have been constructed and set after he had caught the family, then there wouldn't have been enough time before Arkin arrived. This is the one continuity error that perturbs me the most.I would recommend this to anyone who likes action and does not mind a more than a little gore, to at least watch once. This is the second time I've viewed this and enjoyed it more the second time around.",The Collector

44,MrGKB,Style over substance...,5,4 December 2010,"...forces me to give this torture-porn film a better rating than I would have otherwise, as I am no great fan of the sub-genre in the first place. Very well shot by up-and-coming DP Brandon Cox, and otherwise the brainchild of the ""Saw"" writing/directing/production team, with effectively gruesome fx courtesy of Gary J. ""Feast"" Tunnicliffe and his crew, ""The Collector"" simply can't transcend its derivative patchwork of a script. That's a shame, because the ""hook"" (pardon the allusion) is a good one: a desperate burglar selects a home that is simultaneously targeted by a sadistic madman, and ends up trying to save the family he's robbing. Great concept, but it's mangled worse than its ostensible victims by too many ""oh, c'mons!"" and plot contrivances. The nature of the maniac is kept far too obscure for an audience to accept, and the credits reel promise of a sequel simply isn't going to be enough to bring them back for a second round of mayhem (not that that's going to stop them, of course). Josh ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" Stewart underplays things at times, but won me over. The rest of the cast, like Josh, are primarily TV actors of the yeoman category, but it's not the acting that pulls this gritty-looking video nasty down into the ranks of disappointment; it's the filmmakers' insistence on loosening one suspension of disbelief after another. What could have been a very tight and unsettling film, possibly along the lines of ""Funny Games,"" ended up sabotaged by its own conceits. Worth a look-see by genre fanatics, but not likely to please the general moviegoer, nor those of us who demand a coherent, believable storyline. The score by Jerome ""Cecil B.

I figured it might as well be Saw 13... I mean really, who cares? The title sequence was like a low brow version of the sequence in Seven by David Fincher. Soon after, the film went it to its' weakest segment - the set-up. Our star, who also had a small role in another film that I rented, Law Abiding Citizen(don't bother), is working a small construction job at a nice house. Later we find out that his wife/girlfriend/baby'smomma is in debt to a loan shark, and our hero must break into the big house at his worksite in order to pay off her debt.From the time he enters the house, until the title flashes across the screen for the second time to indicate the end of the movie - The Collector fires on all cylinders. Fast paced. Well Shot. Sort of like SAW met the Original Hell Night and they had a baby.Good horror flick for fans of the genre, and a decent 'B' movie at any standard.

Unfortunately, Arkin doesn't realise until it's too late that someone else is already in the house...and it's not a family member. As he tries to escape without being caught, Arkin discovers that the various ways out have all been blocked with an array of vicious traps, and when he sees what is happening to the family he quickly discovers that this is no ordinary intruder. What started out as a simple robbery attempt has quickly turned into a deadly cat and mouse game for survival.The Collector is yet more proof that a film doesn't need to be 99% full of special effects, have a massive budget, and have a deep (but confusing) storyline to be entertaining as this flick is quite a gem. The story's a simple one, yes, but it never get's monotonous and it doesn't set out to be something it's not. It doesn't set out to have a deep intricate storyline and if you were expecting one then you'll be sorely disappointed (as well as naive).The entertainment factor for this film is the sheer suspense that it creates, which is quite intense at times, and the cat and mouse action between the Collector and Arkin is handled well to keep that suspense peaked. Some of the scenes are pretty gory as well to say the least, but the gore is not used for the pure sake of it like some movies I've seen. Let's face it...when the main ""bad guy"" of the movie has set up traps - like bear traps, for instance - to stop people escaping then you know it's not going to be pretty.The traps aren't ingenious, but this isn't Saw we're watching here (even though it has the dark atmosphere of a Saw movie), so as long as you don't go in expecting that then you'll be fine.

51,asda-man,Collect this one!,7,29 December 2011,"I didn't exactly know what I was going to get with ""The Collector"", some people were saying it's a complete gory mess with it being sick and twisted for the sake of it with no character development or plot. Whereas others were telling me it was fantastic gory mayhem, full on intensity and thrills. I didn't know if I was getting a ""Live Feed"" or an ""Inside""! It was neither. Thankfully it wasn't as horrendously repugnant as ""Live Feed"" and it wasn't as incredibly masterful as ""Inside"", it's your run-of-the-mill horror film that is just simply fun and thrilling to watch.The first thing that surprised me was the directing! The film has this great grainy 80's feel to it and gets into the action very quickly. ""The Collector"" grabs you by the throat and leaves you their until the credits roll up (and then briefly grabs you again, as there is a little bit extra after the credits). I have seen a lot of worse films than this one and I think it offers more than people are likely to believe. Just because it's by some people who wrote ""Saw"" doesn't mean that it's going to be bad! And yes it does borrow some things from ""Saw"" but ultimately it is it's own movie, and it's a pretty intense one at that.The fantastic camera angles and intense directing make this an edge-of-your-seat horrifying thrill ride. Yes it has many clichés, and yes it does indulge itself in mindless violence but I don't think ""The Collector"" is trying to be a revolutionary horror film. The kills are imaginative and memorable. The special effects are very good on the whole actually and their are plenty of moments that will make you cringe.It has a great claustrophobic atmosphere and their is this horrific feeling of not being able to get out and the booby traps are also quite clever and didn't take over the film like I thought they would. In the end ""The Collector"" is a brilliantly fun horror film which delivers something we've all seen before but in a slightly different way. It's an intense and thrilling ride with some excellent suspenseful directing, and an intriguing killer. These kids obviously know their stuff!",The Collector

The Collector himself is certainly an interesting villain, and the film provides us with a protagonist to root for even if he is a thief. This is from the writers of some of the Saw films so one should know what to expect. This is a violent and unpleasant movie full of deliberately ugly, claustrophobic visuals, bloodshed, underdeveloped characters and dark lighting. How much people like it will depend on their tolerance of this, although 30% on Rotten Tomatoes was a bit unfair. On one hand, it's a nasty, mean-spirited gore-fest which isn't massively scary and is full of uninteresting characters. As well as that, the film is pretty weak before the main scenario begins and the ending is lame. On the other hand, it may not be that scary but it's very tense and as a suspenseful and dark thrill ride, it undeniably works. This will divide audiences probably. It's perfectly acceptable but the horror fans will be the ones who enjoy this the most. 5/10",The Collector
53,danielmanson,Wasn't as bad as I feared,5,8 January 2021,"I'll just jump into this quick review I think. The first 20 mins or so of this film is, honestly, one of the worst bits of film I've ever seen in my life. It's so poorly done it's baffling. The scenes are really quick and jumpy, absolutely nothing gets explained. You watch 10 seconds then it jumps to something completely different, you haven't a clue what's going on. If you hadn't read the bio of this film you wouldn't know why he was entering the house to begin with.However the film does massively pick up when the main bulk of the movie starts. The suspense is held great and you're metaphorically sat on the edge of your seat wondering what's going down next and do they get out! I assume a lot of people watch this for the gore and I can confirm there is a good chunk in there and in good detail.A few points about the plot I hated.The film had this odd obsession for bugs which was never explained. It has about 7 or 8 close ups of various insects. Why?The booby traps in the house. Ok I know a few people worked on it, but I'm sorry there is no way in hell these complicated traps were done in a day, they would have taken weeks.Do mobile phones not exist?The ending. The film ends quite nicely... or so you think, as it decides to lob an extra scene into the film which just wasn't really needed. Threw everything into question. I won't explain why, but I guarantee it'll bug you too.why was he doing all this? Ok, it is briefly explained what he's doing. He's a collector. But, I feel like it needed more. and how does he get a group of them working on the traps needed? This just needed more depth.Despite these flaws, the film was still quite entertaining.

The gore quotient is pretty high in some scenes so this is definitely not for the squeamish at hear. the dialogs are minimal and the tempo is maintained by the director by the help of kick ass music.

The plot is ridiculously implausible and the ending is abysmal.The idea and execution of the 'traps' and blocked exits is fine, but to have one man set it all up in a day ... stupid. We see the good thief enter and make his way to the safe without trouble, then minutes later the whole house seems to be booby-trapped and he can't get out the way he came in. Then we have the gun in the safe but no bullets - why keep an empty box in an underwear drawer anyway? Then of course there is the usual bad guy who seems to have supernatural abilities to avoid injury and recover from multiple broken bones and knife wounds in seconds. We also know very little about this baddie, or why he does what he does, and I still have no idea why he is 'The Collector'. If he collects bodies, why does he spend so much time setting traps and mutilating them in their own home when presumably he has a dungeon of his own, as all good serial killers do. And as for the ending ... what is it with scriptwriters and endings? 9 out of 10 cannot end a film properly. Here the 'good thief', having overcome the baddie and his traps, and a fair bit of mutilation, escapes and decides to crown his success by throwing himself in front of a speeding cop car. No worries, despite being totally smashed-up he lives, but the army of police and ambulances still can't save him from the resurrected baddie. Stupid and displeasing to say the least.",The Collector

It played out like a slasher in ways too although it was all done in one house and there wasn't any ""slashing"" present. I enjoyed it as it was a really gory and bloody psycho on the loose thriller and the death methods were good.The movie starts out showing Arkin (the handyman who will be a hero in some sorts) looking very suspicious, he seems to hold no fear and is a smooth criminal. The first part of the movie plays out like a crime drama and then the bloodshed begins once the robbery attempt is in play and the movies style changes.Marcus Dunstans direction wasn't too bad, he and Patrick Melton wrote the screenplay and they have worked on several of the SAW movies as well as the amazing FEAST trilogy.

The basis for the plot is generic at best, a man goes to rob a place to pay off loan sharks for wife and gets caught in a web of sadistic torture. The house this takes place in, come on, way to small of a house to hold that many traps, and when did this killer have the time to set up these traps when the sub text this was all supposed to take place within a day.

65,RockPortReview,A sleeper Horror hit! See it.,8,27 January 2011,"The Collector 11/11/10When the guys behind the most recent ""Saw"" movies had some extra time in their busy schedules they made a small independent horror film called ""The Collector"". Since the ""Saw"" movies they were apart of were nothing but pure crap, I was a little hesitant about watching this movie, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how effective and entertaining it was. This is a real sleeper hit in the cluttered world of horror.Released into a few theaters in 2009 and now on DVD, this movie really delivers the goods. High suspense, brutal violence and gore and characters you actually like for a change. Our hero is Arkin is a small time crook trying to turn his life around, he has a young daughter that lives with his ex-wife. His ex is in deep with some loan sharks and needs money by the end of the night. He has been working a construction job at this rich families home and decides the only way to get the money he needs in a hurry is to rob the place. Things start out well until he runs into the Collector. Kind of like showing up at a party wearing the same dress. These two are on quite the collision course.Since this movie has so much going for it you tend to ignore the clichéd and ridiculous moments like a strip club scene, Arkin just wants his family back, and the killer that wears a mask not to mention several others. ""The Collector"" really shines in its building of suspense and the cat and mouse games played by Arkin and the killer. Most of the action takes place in this big opulent house, where they are fully aware of each others presence. The Killer also seemed to have the time and the resources to rig up meticulous traps in each room (this is the ridiculous part) to make Arkin's life a bit more difficult. While Arkin just wants to rob the wall safe and leave. The Collector wants to torture and kill the owners and who ever comes by. The traps do seem to be obviously inspired by the famous ""Saw"" traps although with a sort of twist. As the title advertises the killer collects one live victim and stashes them in a red trunk from each of his crimes. Will Arkin be added to his collection?

66,Indyrod,"Disturbing, demented, a real jewel for gorehounds",10,17 May 2010,"Talking about demented, sick and and disturbing, this little jewel trumps them all, because its loaded with stomach churning gore too. Do I have your attention gore hounds? haha, I thought so. The guys that made this excessive torture movie, are the screenwriters behind several SAW movies, and the FEAST movies, so you know you are in for a ride. Fasten your seatbealts, this is a hell of a ride, and don't expect any FEAST type humor, this is a bad to the bone very demented movie. Begins with a family moving into a new home, and an ex-con helping with the move, decides to rob it for jewels because he owes his ex-wife some money borrowed from loan sharks. Bad idea, terrible deadly mistake. As he begins his robbery, things are going pretty smooth, until he meets up with somebody else who has taken over the house, and he has no intention of robbing anything. This masked figure has set deadly traps all through the home, barred up the windows and doors, and all ready started slicing and dicing the family. These extreme torture movies don't usually bother me that much, but this one definitely got my attention. This was inspired I guess from the traps in SAW, but the story is not related in anyway. This killer is about as nasty and brutal as they come, and he loves to take a little off here and a little off there, to make his victims suffer as much as possible before the death blow. This is some intense stuff folks, very very intense, and I give it my highest gorehound rating, because it definitely rawks... Yes, very disturbing, pretty difficult to watch at times, but isn't that what we are looking for? Of course it is, and ""The Collector"" delivers in spades.NOTE: Watch this DVD until the very end, because there is a pretty damn good scene after the credits roll, that might make you smile, and ties up a couple of lose ends. You want to know about the BOX, then do not stop your DVD until after the credits roll.",The Collector
67,Siamois,Could have been great,6,11 February 2010,"As the story of the Collector unfolds, it quickly becomes obvious that writer/director Marcus Dunstan is knowledgeable when it comes to the horror genre and knows what makes people click. First, there is a 70s/80s feel to this movie. From the dirty-ish cinematography to the pacing, editing and the casting choices, a lot of this reminds me of the less polished horror films of these decades. One of the aspects where this movie shines is with its protagonist Arkin. A down-on-his- luck handyman struggling to pay his bills. Josh Stewart was a revelation for me in this role. I can't wait to see what the future has in store for this actor. Is he a one-note actor who was perfectly cast or is this some serious talent? I for one would lean toward the latter. Stewart is perfect in making us feel Arkin is a decent guy with a will of is own but just suffers from a total lack of respect by the people around him. He oozes charisma despite the ""loser"" role he has to work with and reminds me a little bit of Sean Penn. What makes the film effective is really exploring the character of Arkin early on. There is a simple situation driving this man to do what he is about to do and we can relate to him. Unfortunately, the movie begins to lose steam when Arkin gets inside the house. At first, the traps and situations are intriguing. But character and story development halts to a crawl. Who is the collector and what is the meaning of this collection? We don't really know and Dunstan doesn't seem to care in the least. Themes explored throughout the movies? Again, doesn't seem very relevant. As the story progresses, the traps become the star of the film and the whole thing seems more and more far-fetched. What should be the meat around the bone becomes the entire movie. The concept seems more like the latest horror gimmick. It's a somewhat interesting and entertaining one but one must deplore all the character development of Arkin if the rest of the movie was really just about mindless fun. All in all, this is a solid movie reminiscent of the trashy, dirty 70s and early 80s horror flicks. But it seems to be lacking in themes and symbolism that made those movies so great and I sensed the writing lost its purpose mid-way. I also deplore what I sense like a desperate attempt to build a franchise, as opposed to make a great movie. The movie seems like a setup for sequels, a TV series pilot more than a single work of art to be enjoyed. The movie deserves a 5.5 and is relatively well-done. If this review seems harsh, it's just that the first half hour or so lets you think the movie will be much more powerful than it actually ends up being. Very curious to see if a sequel will be done for this one.",The Collector
68,repojack,Reverse home invasion,6,23 March 2021,"This is almost like a reverse home invasion -- a hapless robber finds out the home he's robbing has been completely booby trapped with the family still there either captured or in hiding.The premise is preposterous -- the robber was at the house earlier that day. There is no way one guy could've set all of those elaborate, Saw-like, traps because, well, it apparently gets him off. And I am still not sure why this movie is called The Collector.All that being said, this was far more entertaining than I expected. Instead of a bunch of annoying and vain young models being slain one by one, we follow the likable Josh Stewart as Arkin, trying to navigate the plethora of traps.You could do much worse for a horror movie pick.",The Collector
69,utahman1971,Another great movie to take away from reality,10,8 February 2010,"I just watched it and boy did time fly watching it. I wanted more after this one. An exterminator that helps a family fix up their mansion, and the family says they will be taking a vacation. The exterminator finds out his wife is behind on paying back some sharks. So he decides to break into the mansion to steal a diamond rock not cut yet. While in the process of stealing the diamond in the mansion, he finds out he is not alone in the house, and the family is still their being tortured by a masked man called ""The Collector"" that is just in the mood to torture and kill anyone that gets in his way. The collector leaves all kinds of traps like bear traps, fish hooks, knifes, wire, acid, glue, nails, razors. The gore is intense like in Saw movies.The end was good. Makes you think what could be next. People think all movies should be perfect with just end it with dead killer, and never show another movie of it. How do you think that some killers keep doing what they do if they are always killed the first time. There would be no killers on the streets now if the movies were not made to be like reality. Killers do get away and killed or caught later. I think a series of this would be good. We need something different than remakes now a days. I don't give rats a@@ if we don't see a remake for a while. I will see the ""A nightmare on Elm Street"" remake and hope it is a good remake, otherwise I will keep hating these dang remakes.This maybe no originality, but it is better than some horror flicks out. It was fast paces through the whole movie. It was at the end and I was like where did the time go. I did like the gore. There are some horror movies that should not be horror, because if you know the definition of horror does not mean scary at all. The PG-13 movies should not be considered horror at all. They should be thrillers. Well, enough of my babbling. Enjoy this watch.",The Collector
70,TheRadiobox,Collects many pros and cons,5,13 September 2021,"The Collector was directed by Marcus Dunstan, written by Dunstan and Patrick Melton and stars Josh Stewart, Karley Scott Collins, Andrea Roth, Michael Reilly Burke, Madeline Zima, and Juan Fernandez. It's about a man trying to escape from the scene of his thievery after he realizes the place has been boobytrapped.The Plot: It's quite clear that the Collector was originally conceived as a Saw sequel (or prequel or presequel or reboot or-) as its plot is deeply entrenched in its torture porn intentions and it hardly aspires to create something worth raising an eyebrow at. It would be fine to stick to a high concept if the rest of the movie lived up to it. Arkin (Stewart) is working on fixing a house for Michael (Burke) and Victoria (Roth), a married couple who are parents of Hannah (Collins) and Jill (Zima). Unbeknownst to them, Arkin is planning on stealing a ruby the couple have kept in their safe. When Arkin returns to the house after dark he gets the ruby, but on his way out is locked in and endangered by scores of traps set up in mere hours by the Collector (Fernandez). The central premise is unnecessarily flawed, why have Arkin come back to the house on that particular day and not show the traps being set? It's the only major hole in the plot, which is bizarre since it was an easy fix. Arkin soon figures out that the family has been trapped too and is faced with a dilemma in having to choose to save them while elevating the risk he faces or escaping solo. The plot's simple, mostly tight, and offers ample opportunity for terror; graciously eschewing the convolution of the Saw franchise.The Characters: While there are plenty of characters within the movie, it's a show run by Arkin, Hannah, and the titular character. Arkin is a surprisingly strong lead because he resides in a grey area of morality for a large chunk of the runtime. He's doing what he's doing only because his estranged wife has gotten herself into trouble with some shady characters who threaten Arkin's family. Logically it should be his wife thieving the jewel but Arkin is willing enough to take point so his family (mostly his daughter) remains intact. The movie gives a little time to ruminate on his actions, which is a good decision. Arkin is better than nearly every horror protagonist because that's what he becomes: a likeable person. He's cordial with the Chase family, taking to Hannah presumably because of her similarity to his own daughter and makes some surprising decisions regarding her and the rest of the family. The antagonist is the polar opposite. He's literally a blank slate; faceless, without dialogue, without motive, without backstory. He likes bugs though. I guess that's... something. It's immensely disappointing that a character as strong as Arkin doesn't have a real person to face-off with. The rest of the family are just there to be tortured, quite mean spiritedly in fact. Without Arkin (and Stewart's electric performance) the Collector (the movie) would fall flat on its face.The Horror: As mentioned, this movie was originally intended to be connected in some way to the Saw franchise, and as such lurches farther towards ludicrous gore instead of something more interesting to put its protagonist through. While not without tension thanks to a few close calls that Arkin has with the enemy and close calls with the Chase family who are initially untrusting of him, it's again disappointing that the movie doesn't ever touch the opportunities it presents itself. Also a detriment is the cheapness of some of the scares that surround Hannah. Child endangerment in movies doesn't necessarily equal the easy way out (see the Bruce Willis starrer Hostage). When the child in the movie acts like a plot device (this movie) instead of an actual integral piece of the plot's progression (Hostage), it becomes an issue. Aside from that, the Collector is mostly shock value instead of legitimate terror, choosing to linger on things like a melting cat and ripping flesh from bone. It's cringe-inducing, sure, but far from scary once the initial impact wears off, the rest of the movie just sinks in trying to raise its own bar.The Technics: With their experience on the low budgeted Saw movies, it's to zero surprise that the Collector is a well-constructed movie, even managing to look leagues more realistic thanks to it being shot mostly on location instead of on cheap sets. Credit must go to Gary J. Tunnicliffe and the rest of the makeup effects team for stepping up to the plate and crafting some wince-worthy and lifelike effects, even if they do eventually overstay their welcome. Cinematography by Brandon Cox is decent too in that he keeps the camera steady, undoubtedly confident in the effects holding up their end of the bargain. The score, however, is just ugly; foregoing raising the feeling of isolation in lieu of shrieking notes and out-of-place metal inflections. Dunstan's direction is passable, if a little less than impressive at times. The location and makeup keep the movie from feeling as flat as it really should be, as the Collector is a mostly barely-above-average movie on a technical level.While certainly better than every Saw movie released before and after it, the Collector is still a mixed bag in its failure to provide logic to its core premise, a memorable villain to match its strong hero, and cheap usage of some cliches and a child being blatantly used as a plot device. Thankfully, it does have Josh Stewart and the Arkin character, who are both easily the highlights here. They both deserve something better.58/100.",The Collector
71,iguth,Just watch Saw,4,11 May 2019,"The Collector is a somewhat throwaway movie. If you want some spooky ominous undertones, it has them. If you want some gore that to me seems almost final destination level, it has it. If you want an odd plot and characters that you don't like very much, it has that too. A premise where the majority of a movie takes place in one house is hard to pull off and this one does pull it off. However most of the scenarios seem not well thought out. There are some good moments of reference throughout. The villain is not very well thought out (he just kills people without a good motive). And the effects are cheesy but fine. I do think that overall it would be an insult to compare this movie to the Saw franchise like many do.",The Collector
72,BakuryuuTyranno,Surprisingly good,6,15 January 2011,"Expected another movie with gratuitous excessive gore and silly jump ""scares"". Fortunately, those aren't found within this movie.Anyways, essentially the film relies on atmosphere, which actually didn't work out so great, and some violence that's... well like the early Saw movies many traps involved things like fish hooks and razor blades, objects that the audience can easily imagine how much pain the characters feel. The needle in the phone was pretty cringe-worthy.There are some silly moments however since while most traps consist of household objects or objects the killer could easily bring to the location, some, including an acidic substance that covered the floor of a room, are pretty questionable.",The Collector

Its not horrible but it leaves you scratching your head as to why it all happened. The lead actor plays his part well but that can't save us from",The Collector
74,Craig_McPherson,"A good film at its core, if you can get past the gore",4,12 April 2010,"Trends in Hollywood tend to come and go. One year's fascination quickly gives way to another and so it is that I've found myself hoping that the horror sub-genre known as ""torture porn"" would hopefully give way to a return to more sophisticated story telling. Yet, while not as prevalent as it was a couple of years ago, I'm sad to say this envelope pushing trend doesn't appear to show any signs of abating.It's all too bad, really, because many of the movies that fall into the TP category have, at their essence, really compelling stories that find themselves buried under mountains of blood, gore and entrails. The moment the maxim ""what's been seen cannot be unseen"" starts to compete with the plot, you know the viewer is in trouble.The latest case in point is The Collector. Originally envisioned as a prequel to Saw, but created as a vehicle in its own right when that franchise's producers balked, this is a movie that has much more going for it than standard horror fare.It all starts with the premise, telling the story of Arkin (Josh Stewart), a member of a contracting crew renovating a large estate owned by a jeweller. As it turns out, Arkin moonlights as a burglar and sets his sights on the family safe, where he hopes to score some gemstones and help his ex wife pay off her loan-sharks. Expecting the family to be out of town, he returns and breaks in, but while there he discovers there's another intruder skulking about whose agenda doesn't involve mere diamonds, but rather the selection and torture of humans for his ""collection"" and the family, which didn't leave town after all, is being held at the psycho's mercy. The result being that Arkin must bring all his skill as a burglar to bear to not only hide from The Collector, but in a novel turnabout, becomes the saviour of the captives as he attempts to rescue the very people he set out to rob.There's a lot going on here to like, from the cat and mouse game played out between the two criminals, to Arkin's navigating the Saw-like traps that The Collector has laid in wait for the family's kids to come home, and his desperate attempts to figure out a way to thwart The Collector at his own game.Unfortunately the film succumbs to the temptations of the genre, and Director Marcus Dunstan feels obliged to deliver the requisite scenes of gore and dismemberment, much of which is purely gratuitous and not needed given the compelling nature of the plot. While it may be too much to ask that horror films be gore free, when the camera lingers almost gleefully on hooks piercing human flesh, severed tongues and eyes being stitched shut, this is when lines start to be crossed, treading into that queasy territory of quasi-pornographic fetishism.So this is the dilemma posed by The Collector – an above average premise that sees itself weighed down by excessive on screen baggage. Though what has been seen cannot be unseen, the film makers would have been better off remembering that the terrors the mind's imagination can conjure up from what is left unseen might well have served this film to a far better end.",The Collector

78,janyeap,A film that merely glamorizes and glorifies tortures and brutality,1,1 August 2009,"Exceedingly violent, exceedingly brutal and exceedingly sadistic! It's a film that literally glamorizes sadistic brutality and torture! And it's very difficult to watch. For me, nothing in it is entertaining, nor worthy of remembering. If you think 'Hostel' is mindless and unnecessarily brutal, this film is even more heinous and with more perverted violence! It seems to have a desperate need to drive the audience into a state of anxiety and shock. Do we really need to see Marcus Dunstan's gratuitous on screen violence and brutalities to deal with during our current economic turmoil? Frankly, I don't think so! We shouldn't welcome inhumane tortures and brutal abuses in real life; we don't need to see them in films. This film is, perhaps, reflective of the twisted and warped mentalities of Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton? None of the cast members in this film does offer memorable or praiseworthy acting talents. The film basically is clustered with scenes of barbarous acts of killing, of gruesome traps, chasing or being chased, and a series of hide-and seek rigmaroles. Dialog is scanty and trasy, and basically a composite of groans and screams. It doesn't really take any experienced actor to take on any of this film's roles. Even Josh Stewart, as the main protagonist, clearly lacks emotional expressiveness! It'd be hilarious if Dunstan and Melton should decide to offer a sequel of this awful film. What can they offer, except for the same opening with their 'evil' box landing in another address and the rest of the film with more glamorization of inhumane tortures and brutality in a crappy with lame dialog and ridiculous characters.I'm surprised that this disgusting film is not rated NC-17.",The Collector

Will Arkin make it out alive? The thing is, we the viewers care, at first. The production values are fine, the movie is well edited and the action clearly plotted out. We are given a guided tour of the house of horror, with the cruel anticipation that someone will be subject to the traps at a later point in the film. Here borrowing from the violent movie, ""Straw Dogs"". I continue to watch as the best defensive plans of the protagonists come to nothing. Would that a Krav Maga fighter would take on the ""Collector"" and put him down. Not to happen; As is the custom in the slasher films that this one is trying to rise above, the killer is as unstoppable as Leatherface, Jason or Freddy.

80,FrightMeter,A gem for true horror fans.,8,17 February 2010,"""The Collector"" didn't make as big of a bang on the horror scene when it was released into theaters. It's box office take was dismal, which is a shame because it is so much better than ""Halloween 2,"" ""The Final Destination."" or several other slasher films that have raked in bucks at the box office recently. Fairly simplistic in its premise, ""The Collector"" deals with Arkin, a down on his luck guy who does odd jobs to bring in an income. His wife owes money to some loan sharks and to try to avoid having them harm her or his daughter, he decides to break into a home where he is doing some work (owned by a jeweler and his family) and steal a precious gem stone. Unfortunately, when he arrives, he quickly discovers that he is locked in a the house with a unknown killer who has painstakingly rigged pretty much every inch of the house with elaborate death traps. Worse yet, he has the family in the basement and is brutally torturing them.""The Collector"" works for several reason, most of which is the fact the killer is extremely creepy and intimidating. When we do a get a decent glimpse of him (which isn't all that often), the most distinguishable feature are his creepy, glowing eyes. His gait is also unique and unsettling. Because of these tiny details, The Collector really is one of the most interesting slasher villains of the last decade. Additionally, the film works because there is not a boring moment to be found. The action comes fast and brisk and the viewer has almost no opportunity to become bored. The plot proves itself to be unpredictable and the claustrophobic setting of the old house is used very effectively. Gore hounds and fans of the Saw series might be surprised to find out that this film really isn't all that gory. I definitely wouldn't call it ""torture porn,"" and though there are definitely some brutal murders, they are more in the vain of an 80's slasher film rather than your ""Saw"" or ""Hostel."" This film's main focus seems to be tension and atmosphere, and both are achieved incredibly well.The only flaw to the film is the ending, which is clichéd to no end. We have seen this same ending countless times before and it not any more surprising or different this time around. Still, this film is engaging, creepy, and fast paced. It is what a slasher film should be--tense and entertaining--and it is certainly one of the better efforts to have a theatrical release in quite some time.Grade: A-",The Collector
81,politehere,Well-Done Horror Movie,9,1 January 2015,"I had written a review for this movie before and had given it a low rating. I watched it again after five years and enjoyed it immensely. It's probably because I watched it on my PC before and this time on my Full HD TV. It made a great deal of difference. Everything looks ten times scarier on the big screen.Let's get to the movie. The cinematography was awesome and quite professional for a horror movie. The camera angles, the lighting and the music score perfectly fit the atmosphere. It was almost as thrilling and engaging as the Saw series, although I enjoyed The Collector even more. The traps set were not as intricate as the ones in Saw series, but they were more believable and plausible, which I think made the movie scarier and easier to connect with. It was very intense, thrilling and scary and I strongly recommend it to people who wouldn't mind watching effective gory movies from time to time.I agree that the movie is riddled with plot holes and a threadbare back story, but if you could just shut your brain down and immerse yourself in the unrealistic world of the movie you will have a lot of fun. If you can't do that and your logical brain normally prevents you from enjoying flicks, you'd better avoid this and watch a Drama movie instead. If you're looking for logic, story and character development, you won't find it here.

82,Foxbarking,Unsure About the Fuss,5,1 August 2009,"I have read some comments about how good this movie is and I am not sure I can agree. The previews left a whole lot open as to what was going to happen. Upon entering the movie (since I don't read spoilers) I really had no idea what direction this film was going to go.The direction of the film is the first thing I have to take issue with. At times, it is brilliant. There are camera angles and shots that just made my jaw drop. However, there were things, such as the seemingly meaningless shots of arachnids and insects and the long musical stances showing stills of the characters that I did not get.This movie could have really hit home for me if it tried harder. At first, it seemed to be pulled from my very nightmares. I have dreams often of being wrapped in barbed wire and having to slowly extract the wire without causing too much damage. If I am not dreaming about that, I may dream about having fish hooks around and not only trying to not get snagged, but once I get snagged, trying to be careful to pull them out causing the least damage possible.However, in these dreams, the situation I am freaked out about is not solely based on gore. It is intricate, and I am trying to cause the least damage possible. This is not something that happens much in this movie.I don't want to give anything away. I really don't like people who feel they have to post spoilers because they can't comment on the movie without doing much. I gave the movie 5 stars, but I would have given it 8 if not for the ending.

83,cmovies-99674,Great torture horror,9,8 November 2017,"PROS: For starters, the acting in this film is so good its beyond words. The true raw emotions that each actor takes on is revealed with such honesty that it is hard to look over. You had love, fear, compassion, and pain that embody the film and its rawness so well. The other thing that I noticed as a critic was tactfulness of the plot. For me it is the little things that can throw a film off, but in this movie those little things were addressed in a polished way. This overall made the already great storyline even better! The whole idea of a booby trapped house made for a compelling film. And to top it all off the film was so well crafted. The special effects were great, the scenery was terrific, and the setting was so well organized and thought out.CONS: The biggest problem I had was with the resolution and build up of tension. To me there were way to many climaxes and just a really crummy resolution. The ending could've been better if it wasn't after 4 different climaxes.

84,starlit-sky,poorly made horror,2,8 September 2010,"I have always been a fan of horror genre ever since I was a little kid but mere torture or gore just don't scare me unless it is within the context of a good story, well-developed characters and good acting. Unfortunately, The Collector contains none of these elements. It is a failed attempt of combining various concepts from past horror movies. (Jason, The Friday the 13th, Halloween, Saw, etc.).I think the writer wanted to write a character who sets up traps (my mind instantly went to SAW installments and not surprisingly, I later learned that the director was the writer for SAW IV, V and VI). But he wasn't quite sure in what kind of environment the traps would be set --I am sure the traps were the starting point in his script. Unfortunately, he got stuck there and couldn't flesh it out quiet right. And that is the reason why this movie is such a mess.An intruder breaks into a house only to discover that there is another intruder (yes, the Collector) already there. It is unclear how sooner that the collector got into the house before our hero. But I guess it must have been a lot sooner since he had to set up all those traps which don't make any sense whatsoever. There is no reason why he would go all through that trouble of setting up traps at every corner of the house. I think only somebody who is expecting to be attacked by multiple assailants would do something like that. They cannot be possibly for the family he took hostage since he must have taken them hostage before setting up the traps. Was he expecting other people to break into the house? There are so many flaws and holes in the story; other reviewers already mention them. Please stick with the low-rated reviews because they are accurate. Why would anyone be entertained simply by the mere sight of torture, blood and gore, I don't know. I think some producers/writers/directors think that torture and gore would scare people. They only create a sense of disgust - they really don't scare. Creating a sense of disgust is easy; it is actually creating a true scare that is difficult. Alfred Hitchcock never used gore or blood but his pictures were masterfully scary. I think horror genre is becoming genre for kids and teenagers.",The Collector

The violent and bloody scenes are on average level but lose their visual impact and emotional value because the characters and their stories are totally neglected.
Everything seems just a horror version of Home Alone (1990)
Personally I didn't like the video editing - adding color and noise effects over the original video felt so cheap.
... and last but not least...Josh Stewart's acting was awful.In conclusion:
Watch the movie Don't Breathe (2016) instead. It's far more accomplished.",The Collector
87,RileyOnFilm,A thriller with multiple levels of bad guys,7,24 November 2017,"The writer of ""Saw IV"" and V directed this one and it is similarly a work of greatness. It doesn't have a the budget or acting power of a Saw sequel but it evens out to be an amazing home invasion thriller/horror. I highly enjoyed it.You get to see the morality of a person tested, in a way like ""Saw."" Any artist who works on such a powerful franchise as ""Saw"" is bound to carry over some stuff. Don't go into it expecting that because it's very different but the quality of film-making is on par with that and the horror conventions the collector has assembled in this home invasion film beg a comparison.I recommend this film most for the thriller aspect, though the horror is right there all the way through. I enjoy watching good vs. evil on screen, especially when the writer/director teases the audience with who is the most moral and does it ever change in the movie. With better acting and more of a high tech look, I'd have given this thriller a 10/10. It is still an awesome film that I recommend.",The Collector

The first film directed by Marcus Dunstan, and who also wrote the screenplay along with Patrick Melton. They are known for writing screenplays for Saw 4 - 7 and Feast series. Starring Josh Stewart, Juan Fernandez, Michael Reilly Burke, Karley Scott Collins, Andrea Roth, Madeline Zima, Daniella Alonso, Robert Wisdom, Diane Goldner, William Praed, and others. Awesome performance by the cast, great special effects by Gary J. Tunnicliffe and a creepy cool soundtrack. This is a scary, gory film filled with suspense and will keep you shivering till the very end. The first time I saw it, late at night, it scared the hell out of me and even my Mum was entertained by this movie, although she hates anything to do with horror. Absolutely brilliant, beyond amazing and a masterpiece. This is the twelfth time I've watched it and it is one of my favorite movies and horror icons of all time.

93,brentn,"The series is great, waiting on #3",8,13 February 2021,"I am a Marcus Dunstan fan ever since I saw Feast. However, Feast was a comedic gore fest with crude humour and boisterous characters, Dunstan has opted to take a different path with this film.Arkin O'Brien (Stewart) moonlights as a cat burglar but during the day he does handyman work for a well off family in the sticks. As his girlfriends debt deadline nears, Arkin is forced to use his skills against his clients home and crack the safe to steal some high priced goods. Unbeknownst to him a serial killer, The Collector, has taken the family hostage in their home in order to commit his nefarious need to kill and collect. Cat and mouse games ensue while Arkin attempts to escape the killer and rescue the family.This flew under the radar for most and did not have a theatrical release that was very noticeable but then again neither did Shawshank. This movie proves that a small budget and decent camera work can earn you a loyal fan base. The 3rd installment will be release sometime this year and this reviewer can't wait.

While the implements of torture & death were straight from Saw thats where the similarities end because there is no moral center or message of right or wrong.Now the torture genre has been in full swing for years now & while some have been entertaining most have missed the mark by miles. Im looking at you Eli Roth. I grew up on I Spit On Your Grave & Cannibal Holocaust your going to have to try a lot harder than Hostel to win me over or shock me. What The Collector gets right is that it never stops being mean & nasty. The game of cat & mouse played between the killer & the burglar was intense.Everything takes place in one house on three floors & at the expense of this poor family.There's nothing original or new here yet at every turn The Collector kept me guessing wondering where in the hell it was all going. I don't think the suspension of disbelief was any higher than any other movie so yeah there were a few plot holes that don't add up but the movie is just so ugly & far removed from what average movie goers have come to expect from a horror movie that yup I can forgive it.Also stick around after the credits.,The Collector
96,reallyevilboy,Extreme,6,3 September 2014,"As I have said before I rate horror movies a little higher than I should. Mainly because I am overly forgiving on a genre I am desperate to love as well as the grading curve being lower. A lot more average and below average movies means, in my view a higher rating for the better ones as they are compared to each other rather than movies of other genres.After reading the many sparkling reviews for this film I was eager to see it. I must also admit that as I get older my enthusiasm for violence and gore on the screen diminishes. Things that I would eagerly watch when I was 20 I would now need to turn away or close my eyes while making small squeaking sounds.The violence in this movie was extreme and I found myself unable to watch fragments. It's saving grace is the intelligence behind some of the scenarios.In the end I found myself disappointed, regarding this movie as nothing special that stood out from the crowd.",The Collector
97,Greenzombidog,Stupid fun in the house of mousetrap,7,9 October 2010,OK the plot for this film is a bit dumb. A handy man has been working in a family's home he plans on stealing a very precious diamond from. On the day the family leave for their vacation he returns to the house a few hours later in the evening only to find a masked maniac is torturing the family and has laced the house with traps. just one of the traps he has set would take the amount of time he has had to set up. Basically if you want realism look elsewhere. I personally don't get too hung up on realism in this kind of film so I thoroughly enjoyed it. The maniac is quite menacing and also possesses some awesome knife throwing skills. The look of the movie is very stylish and a lot of the effects are great and quite gory. They seem to use more practical FX than CGI which is refreshing to see. The film held my attention all the way through. Well worth a watch.,The Collector

After watching the film, I was brought back to reality.While the special effects are great, and I enjoy films that mostly take place in one setting; but this is about the extent of what this movie was worth.A weird mismatch of something like ""Don't Breathe"" and the Saw franchise. A cool premis, but it doesn't make much sense.Why does the collector have like six people tied up an tortured in this house? Has nobody hear the bloodcurdling screams? Not even once? It was difficult to fully get into the movie when this was at the back of my head the whole time.
In saying this, the house / trap designs were rather interesting, and helped push this movie alongJosh Stewart did a fairly good job at playing the lead, and several of the victims were great at playing their part.The collector's mask was also pretty cool.

There's nobody in that home except the rich guy, his wife, and daughter. The wife's tied up, the rich guy is tied up, and he doesn't know about the daughter. What exactly is he trying to achieve?

103,thesubstream,"A little bit goofy, a little bit completely terrifying.",6,2 November 2009,"The Collector, directed and co-written by the writer of the last three collectively execrable Saw movies Marcus Dunstan, seems perfectly poised to simultaneously tickle the fancy of devoted horror nuts while at the same time disappointing anyone that considers themselves a casual fan. The details it gets more right than wrong, but the broad strokes - the parts that are hard for non-diehards to swallow - stick in the throat like a dry-swallowed Aspirin.Safe-cracker and erstwhile nice-guy Arkin (Josh Stewart) sneaks into a house he thinks empty, looking for a gem he can sell to get his wife out of loan-shark trouble. Little does he know that the house isn't empty: the family is still home, caught in the clutches of the silent, masked Collector, a cunning, cruel mastermind who for reasons unknown kills those he sees as not fit to collect in his big red box. The Collector has filled the house with all manner of sadistic, cruel booby-traps, which Arkin must navigate in a high-tension game of cat-and-mouse as he tries to rescue the family and escape with his life and the gem.The character of the Collector is really well executed, legitimately scary, pushing all of the right masked-bad-guy buttons. It's a fine calibration, harder to hit than you'd think, finding a balance for the look of a baddie like this: too over the top weird and you have the clown from Saw, too plain and you miss out on the abstract chilling blankness that a Michael Myers with his inverted Captain Kirk mask can achieve. The makers of The Collecter managed to get their bad guy right. His mask is a functional wool lace-up but weirdly molded, contorted and cruel. His eyes glint and reflect light like a dog's. He's got a belt full of throwing knives which is OK a little ridiculous, and the only other feature that marks him out is a janitor's ring of keys on his belt.Josh Stewart as Arkin is great as well, underplaying things as much as he can in a movie where he's constantly getting sliced, punched and stalked through a dark suburban hell hole. There are scenes that are as good as anything in the gore-horror genre, moments of exquisite, twisted tension followed by moments of utter, rank stupidity. Why, exactly, has this dude filled this house with bear traps and razor wire when he's got the whole family chained up? When did he find the time? The Collector's murder kit has got to be freakin huge. Why has he taped cheap steak knives to a chandelier? What is his plan? What is going on here exactly? All of the flavour, the traps and spikes and locked doors that help make the film tense when it works also load it up with a bunch of unexplainable silliness, and when the film doesn't quite work because of that, it seems like not much more than a boring excuse to show more and more carnage and gore.For fans of the genre, people whose mental suspend-disbelief button has got a groove worn in it, for those for whom it's become an autonomic function, the film offers all the great, gory, grisly just-right details in a package that yeah well maybe it doesn't make sense, but who cares it's a movie. For everyone else though, its core silliness stands to make The Collector little more than another in a long, ugly line of unoriginal, gory horror-torture films.",The Collector
104,mecheart,Well crafted disbelief,2,12 August 2013,"What is horror? Is horror a sensation, a feeling, a reaction or a post episodic description recounted with nerve jangling gratefulness to have summoned the courage to travel along with a fictional character down a dark corridor breathing in stale air and brushing tangles of cobweb off your perspiring flesh? While descriptions vary good horror in this reviewer's mind raises dread within the viewer and growing concern for the characters on the silver screen, and one's own senses as suspense builds with an urge to look away from impending shock and the end of a liked player's role in a given plot. Chills ride down the spine as our minds spin to wrap around the grisly concepts presented by the writer and brought to life in moving pictures. The best horror makes us think as high as its shock makes us jump in our seats.Great horror confronts the consumer with a terror incarnate he or she had never imagined and in doing so opens within our minds a new busy train of thought forcing hesitation while we considerate it, interrupting the mundane tasks of our lives; one look over your shoulder before climbing into bed and truly great horror fiction has hit its mark.Enter Marcus Dunstan's 2009 slasher hybrid 'The Collector'. Again I feel compelled to flesh out my horror movie going experience. A single sentence long summary will suffice in this case with much to say and less than 1000 words left to finish. This reviewer has been stalking his latest horror flick fix for over three decades. That squarely lands my horror watching nascence around the release of the original 'Friday the 13th'.Accordingly, I must judge new horror film experiences against the old; the many, the memorable and the legion of those just plain horrible.'The Collector' shares similarities with a trove of horror movie predecessors involving masked killers who commit many sequential murders of innocent movie characters - most often young adults who have taken to a remote location to fornicate and inebriate themselves while waxing lunatic.I have never been a fan of the Slasher sub genre especially when the source of horror reveals itself as a mortal man with an insatiable penchant for inflicting rampant bloody desecration on the human form. There's just too much of that in the daily headlines for this reviewer to want to experience it further in his escape from reality at the movie theater.'The Collector' serves us yet another of the human killer variety, who like many on screen butchers before him, wears a mask and practices his gory trade without so much as a single shred of compassion for even the women or children he seeks to slaughter.Our killer in 'The Collector' is yet another of the sort whom despite never giving his victims a fighting chance, has become an expert with any bladed weapon imaginable. Why master an art of combat if one intends to only harm already maimed, restrained or far weaker prey? As in so many other similar films this film's killer is somehow stronger, faster on his bum leg, smarter and more durable than everyone else involved. He can receive maiming injury in one scene and in the next chase the protagonist down across a field. At least Jason Voorhees was an undead psycho in the films he demonstrated such similar ability. I mean, Jason was resurrected by lightning for goodness sake! The traps set by our killer? I discounted them as tacked on nonsense, a consequence of the zillion 'Saw' movies and their clones and their inevitable influence on future horror pictures.At length, 'The Collector' is a well made movie starring a quite capable lead in Josh Stewart yet despite its score and high production values brings nothing new to a sub genre flooded with doldrums of sameness.As an aside, its tough to feel suspense borne out of concern for a grown man who has entered the spider's web to rob from the family who paid him extra for his handyman work. This particular spider had already caught most of the flies and despite the fact that he was as human as you or I, was portrayed as something more by the film. Disbelief reigns.Unlike so many other reviewers present, I cannot recommend 'The Collector' to any horror movie buff I know. It is a rehash of many, many films and even judged on its own merit, hits far below the true horror mark.",The Collector

It plays with ideas that break the flow, and has characters play out scenes unrealistically and predictably. The collector has a plot in disarray, trying to complete a few interwoven plot details that are clumsily put together. It has an atmosphere that promises potential suspense, but constantly plays out the wrong way when the right way seems a single action away.

While a lot of comparisons will be made with the Saw/ Hostel series 'The Collector' stands out because of the characters. You can actually feel for these characters (unlike the interchangeable and forgettable Saw and Hostel casts).The movie is carried by the performance of its antihero. Josh Stewart was superb as the flawed criminal. His motive for being a criminal are obvious as are his motives for being a hero. He is a rarity in modern day horror... he is believable and likable and 3 dimensional.The movie is very entertaining but with the beginning and ending you know that it has been set up for the unnecessary prequel and/ or sequel which did disappoint me.Apart from that one criticism I really enjoyed this movie.

111,cppguy,Good: like a typical slasher film. Bad: like a typical slasher film,5,10 March 2011,"I don't know why I rented this. It showed up in my mail and I watched. Yes, there are a bazillion plot holes. But let's keep in mind that this genre of film tends to have pneumatic coeds illogically running to -- and hiding in -- the most absurd locations possible.Arkin, the film's protagonist, is clearly from the wrong side of the track. In all fairness to his character, guys trying to go straight don't always get the deed right. Maybe they want to do the right thing, but don't have the mental tools to accomplish it. So our tough guy winds up facing down a sadistic killer who is in the house he's forced to burglarize. Forced? Yes: out of an attempt to protect his beloved daughter and idiot wife.I liked this film for one reason: it came close to implementing two plots gone wrong bye colliding with each other. I always wished I could make such a plot. ""The Alien"" meets ""Jason Vorhees"" or something. I don't mean in the sense that they merely collide in ""Dracula v Frankenstein"" fashion. Instead, I mean that the plots and character interaction that are so amazing from the movies we find so fascinating are suddenly at cross-purposes to the other.Arkin and the collector are out to hurt the same people (Arkin, in fact, is more the traitor), but have gotten in the other's way.It's tough to rate this movie. Production values are good. Acting is professional. The movie does what it's supposed to do: keep you in suspense. That's where the good stuff ends.The bad stuff is near ""Tales from the Crypt"" stupid and obvious and not making the transition to film. There are dangling horrors in the film easily dodged by victims but they suddenly develop the inability to dodge threats. The Collector seems to be able to make traps in minutes that mere mortals would take days to create. Better yet, those traps are in bizarre obscure places, but lacking in places humans would normally go. The Collector gains psychic power to counter his opponent's moves in places where that's unreasonable, but totally loses it in places where he could logically counter Arkin... and vice versa.This could have been a top-notch movie in the ""Saw"" tradition... if only the writers had taken a moment to view things from the position of the characters instead of merely trying to push-home some scenes.As they say, ""the devil is in the details."" Maybe better hire the devil next time.Should you watch this film? Sure. If you like horror/suspense films, I won't call it a waste of time. Regardless, you can at least enjoy the fun of the IMDb forum about ""The Collector."" Then it's well worth the trouble.",The Collector

Little does he know when he gets there, a more demented psychopath is there and boobytraps the place, intending to kill anybody there and take one person back with them (hence why the movie is called the collector). Doesn't that sound awesome?! This dude I ok the time to know the house and set up a wide variety of traps, from bear traps to acid to knives. We are rooting for Arkin to get out alive and either kill or escape from this evil man. There's just an eery feeling to the movie that disturbs you, yet you can't look away.

I don't understand how people have slated this, no its not the best horror but all parts of the movie are done greatly.At the beginning we see a older man and his wife open what looks like a trunk with movement then the film begins.The main character is Arkin a former thief who owes his wife some money for the debt they both owe due that night. Arkin plans to rob a safe from the new mansion he is working on.The Chase family have just moved into a suburban Detroit mansion, Dad Michael his wife Victoria and their 2 children Jill and Hannah. planning to go on holiday they hire a group of builders and help to upkeep the house Arkin being one of those hired.This is where the movie starts to intensify. Arkin breaks in and heads for the safe, hearing a few noises he continues and manages away with some cash and a ruby. He hears footsteps slightly puzzled as he thinks the family are away he heads to leave but narrowly misses a deathly booby trap. Arkin quickly realises he is not alone in he house and its rigged with traps.

The premise is the one thing that sorta saves this for me,the whole Home Alone meets Saw is kind of cool. I think that the film would have been better if it didn't come out during the age of the torture porn film. I also like the Collector,I think he is an interesting slasher. The main problem with the film for me is that it seems to be to worried about the kills and the torture and less about the characters and the film as a whole. See this film if you like gross kills and a good atmosphere.Skip it if you dislike torture porn films or if you want a good entertaining slice and dice. 4/10",The Collector
118,The-Evil-Dead,One of the better horror films in recent years. Simple and effective.,9,9 August 2009,"I'm a fairly avid horror fan and decided to check this out, sort of on a whim, after watching the trailer. Now the writers may be in familiar territory here ( As they were involved with Saw ) and there may be a few people who want to draw comparisons to that series, this is an entirely different animal.The film does start out slightly slow introducing the story elements that are only there for the sake of having a storyline... What follows, though, is about an hour of very suspenseful moments that will keep you guessing at what will happen next. There were very few moments in which I questioned what was happening on screen, and pretty much every element of the film was plausible and well thought out. There was a proper reaction for every action, something that doesn't always happen in a horror film.Another aspect I enjoyed was the killer... He's no invincible behemoth like Michael Myers, but he is intelligent and knows how to get the best out of those he is playing his game with. I loved the mask he had, and the contacts he wore that gave a really nifty effect to his eyes ( Which is made relevant in the film ).The film builds up suspense in excellent ways... There are no stupid plot twists, no ridiculous explanations for anything, including the killer's motives, this film is a simple horror tale. This is where it succeeds greatly.I'd recommend it for any genre fan, while no means is it amazing or perfect, I really enjoyed it throughout the entire film... Particularly the end. There's a satisfactory amount of gore, victims that are typical yet not butchered in the general typical fashion as in most by the numbers horror films.It doesn't break any new ground, but if you want to have a good time at the theater watching a horror flick... Check this one out. I'd give it 4 out of 5 Corpses.",The Collector

120,gareth242000,Awfully bad trash. Torture porn or boredom porn,3,11 January 2011,"Can't believe how bad this film was. It has some tense moments but rather rely on clever film making to create this atmosphere it belongs in this film purely because as the audience we are made only to aware that if the collector should find someone snooping among or messing his plans up he will torture them in horrific ways that should be unpleasant to watch. Mpw i'm not the easily offended type and the violence in this film didn't upset me in anyway, but for gods sake if you are going to have this sort of violence in a movie have a reason for it!!! Who is the collector anyhow? I mean, what really is his purpose? The ending was awful and the alternate ending quite literally the most stupid i have seen, although i do presume this was meant to be funny?If like me your curious to see this movie, if only to see if what you think it will be, it is in fact just that, by all means give it a go, but its some of the most lousy film making i have seen",The Collector
121,Alenbalz,Collectable nonsense,1,11 June 2015,"I'm surprised the screen writers have not been arrested or thrown in the mad house. This is one sick and sadistic movie, with scene after scene of gratuitous gore. Lots of ingenious booby traps but No real story line or character development. We have absolutely no idea why the killer is killing these people. Just how and when the killer installed all these elaborate booby traps is another mystery. And of-course why? Since he already had managed to catch all the adults without really needing them, just some unnecessary drama for the viewers. And there's no real explanation or reason why he left the path from the front door to the upstairs main bedroom and down to the cellar clear. The movie is also written in a time warp because so many things happen in an hour, like the main star (burglar) goes up and down the stairs close to a dozen times, playing hide and seek with the murderer, finally manages to escape the house, but goes back to save the little girl, gets caught, tortured, and manages to escapes again with the little girl, meanwhile a policeman arrives, calls for back-up, just before he gets killed, they arrive faster than superman could, especially as the house that is quite isolated and remote from the city, run the hero over and take him to hospital. The only other time you see so much happen in so little time is in cartoons, which probably would've been a better forum for this ridiculous movie.",The Collector
122,superal1966,A pointless 'teen' gore film dressed up as something deeper,1,30 October 2010,"*Does contain spoilers, for what it's worth*Yes the cinematography may have been excellent as some have commented, but like most people, I watch movies for entertainment. I never thought it possible, but The Collector is possibly more pointless than Basement.The Collector for me pretty much sums up what's wrong with the current 'Horror' genre; this film consists of nothing but gory scenes and deaths without even attempting to place a plot around them. I appreciate films that leave a lot to the imagination and let the viewer make up their own opinions, but I do like to at least know something about what is going on.The main character plans to rob a house to help, presumably his partner or ex-partner, pay off a debt that is not explained. The film actually starts of very promising and for a short while it is actually quite tense. The problems start when an unknown character enters the house; we never find out who he is, why he is there and what he does, other than collecting people. We are only told this by a man in a random box who is apparently the bait, why when the house is bobby trapped all over is a box in a cupboard needed I don't know.The above could be forgiven if the film made any sense. The traps that are set up are quite complex, but our guy manages to put them in place seemingly in minutes, and everybody manages to move from one part of the house to another just to suit the flow of the film. I know this is a film, but the main characters are invincible; our protagonist (who is actually a criminal) has half his hand cut off, he face cut by wires and several fishing hooks and has cockroaches inserted into his stomach, yet by the end of the film you wouldn't have thought any of this would have happened. Our antagonist has a chandelier with knives fall onto his head, and the house for whatever reason explodes with him in it, yet a couple of minutes later he has caught up with an ambulance.On reflection this isn't as bad as Basement as there is something to write about, but the plot holes were so big it's unreal, and what plot there was, didn't make any sense nor made me care about any of the characters. Personally I didn't enjoy The Collector, but I can see it set out to be the type of film it is, and obviously appeals to a certain crowd of people, but this isn't those who watch movies for entertainment.Ultimately it started off with some promise but turned into another teen gory horror film dressed up as something deeper. I understand they are making a sequel, if this is the case, I'm hoping it will explain the first.",The Collector

124,kobrakommand,One of The greatest Horror movies of our time,9,1 September 2010,"This is a phenomenal Horror movie, I mean just amazing. It just creates so much suspense, and the character the Collector is the creepiest deranged psycho I've ever scene, and the fact that he wears a mask just does it for me, and the mask looks like Corey Taylor's death mask only its all black with glowing eyes. The glowing eyes effect was just beyond all else just an amazing effect that really made the character way more creepier, making him seem almost not human. The suspense is just great, It's beyond anything you see anymore. This movie is completely different than all the crap you see now days, this one is a gem, it actually has a unique plot and characters. AND THE SUSPENSE OH THE SUSPENSE! and the gore was just great, the gore is great in this movie, very fitting.One gripe about this movie, and that is the ending. It was kind of an open ending like they were going to do a sequel, which would be in very poor taste because there should never be a sequel to any god damn movie. Though yes there have been good sequels this is not a film that needs one.But there's also one great thing about the ending, they don't show the title at the intro to the movie they show the title at the end, it's very artistic and just actually has great effect, I mean when I saw that Title at the End of the movie it blew my mind and it just gave me shivers down my spine.

The gore/torture doesn't hold back anything, they don't had too much screams or loud music: the movie is just self sufficient and it's really refreshing! In this context, we truly see here some imagination and inspiration: away from every clichés,we can actually enjoy the perspective of having some nice cinematographic movies and not just a whole of nothing like it's so many times the case.

129,warsystem04,"Gritty and engaging, ""The Collector"" is a winner",6,5 November 2012,"I should probably preface this review by mentioning that I saw this movie in the theater when it came out but did not remember it AT ALL since I was with friends and wasn't paying much attention. I decided to give it another shot on my own again recently when I heard the sequel was coming out soon.""The Collector"" supplies a very interesting twist on a classic and well tread plot: Killer is in the house, the other people can't leave the house. The ""hero"" is more so an anti-hero, as he himself enters the house with the intent of doing wrong. He gets outdone though, and must not only save himself, but the rest of the family inside. Where this film succeeds most of all however is it's use of VERY gritty and tense sequences, reminding me of the original ""Toolbox Murders"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" at times. Edge of your seat, gruesome, suspenseful scenes from one to the next with dim lighting and an overall grimy feel.I must admit that I'm surprised that the team behind some of the ""Saw"" films worked on this, because I don't particularly like the series, or the ""torture porn"" craze in general. While this flick contains traps and I suppose some of the gore reminiscent of the ""Saw"" movies, it never seems contrived or frivolous, rather it just builds mood and adds that interesting twist I mentioned earlier. I saw a review another user wrote in which they described the use of traps as ""an R rated Home Alone"" and I completely agree.The viewer is also connected to the characters, particularly Arkin as he stalks around the house trying to save the family from danger. The film avoids the overuse of dialog, and I see this as a good point, as it creates even more of the dark atmosphere and tension through visuals rather than wasted talk. I should also mention that I really like the idea behind The Collector character himself, and a very smart, yet still brutal ""Horror Icon"" is a welcome addition to the pantheon.The film was left WIDE open at the end for a sequel, which of course is due to be released in a couple of weeks. I'm very interested to see what direction the new one takes, and hope it is at least on par with the first.",The Collector

In short, the lead wants to steal a precious gem from the safe and he enters the house while the owners are away on holiday - he knows they are away as he is their casual gardener. Easy,right? Wrong. Someone else is in the house and this man lays traps that kill - what starts is a cat and mouse chase through the house - can the hero escape with the gem and save his wife from loan sharks? Does the collector get what he came for? Maybe... or do neither get what they want? It sounds crazy but it really works and the suspense is there, sure the traps he leaves are a little OTT and how he managed to set them up without anyone spotting him is just out there (Wait for the cat scene) - but - it works. My review sounds like babble because in theory I should be slating this film but somehow I just can't.It is an original idea done well and while it does kind of cash in on Saw-esque it does it's own thing smartly. The direction and acting are pretty solid and the effects are good as well - I am pretty sure the budget was tight but they used what they had well. On that basis I can overlook the obvious holes.All I can say is watch it with an open mind and take it for what it is. It will never win Oscars but I like it and I know you will.

If I were to rate a musical, I would probably give it a low score myself. This movie is not perfect, but because the horror in it is done well enough, it is worthwhile to suspend some disbelief to go along with the ride. This isn't a PG-13 teen scare. People tote the term ""torture-porn"" I think because the killing is done is such an unapologetic, organized fashion. Every kill is planned and gruesome. In the horror genre, what actually is wrong with that? While Rob Zombie and others are destroying monsters (Zombie basically killed the icon of Michael Myers) by humanizing them too much, it is refreshing to have a new killer killing for killing-sake. Isn't that worth a ride (assuming you are into horror)?",The Collector
135,sorinapha,Surprisingly good,8,23 November 2015,"As with most contemporary horror, I've been hearing mixed reviews of this one, but wow! I'm honestly very surprised, this film far surpassed my expectations. I watched The Collection (2012? maybe 2011?) on Netflix a few months ago not knowing it was a sequel and it was good, just not mind-blowing. However, after seeing this one, I may have to re-watch it and re-evaluate my opinion of it.This movie gave me something the horror genre hasn't shown me in a while-- a villain that isn't presented alongside some kind of a sympathetic back story. To some, that may take away from the power, but to me, it's so much more chilling that way. Even we, the audience members, don't know why this man goes to the lengths that he does to torture and kill. We are just as in the dark about this man and his intentions as his victims, which makes this film all the more thrilling. Its gore sequences are pulled off with poise and even grace-- well, if you could call gore scenes graceful, anyway.It's also interesting to me, being a particular fan of the Saw series, to watch this film with the knowledge in mind that it was written to be a Saw prequel. With this knowledge in mind, being able to compare and contrast the films, in order to see what passages the writers meant as a homage to the 2004 hit, and what attempts they were making to steer the series and its themes into a different direction. However, in the end, I'm glad it wasn't incorporated into the Saw series: both Saw and the Collector do well on their own, but to connect the two even in name would have implied too drastic a change of Jigsaw's MO, and would have felt a smidge inauthentic.Basically, if you are a horror fan and have any doubts, watch it. Even if you don't like it, it's gory enough that you'll at least find one scene to admire. And be sure to wait through the credits! There's a few seconds of footage which foreshadow the sequel nicely.",The Collector
136,Demonic_Entity-1,An Effective Chiller.,9,11 August 2009,"From the writers of the FEAST trilogy and SAW IV-VI, Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, comes a new and terrifying film called, THE COLLECTOR. The premise for the flick is a simple one, yet executed with tons of suspense and moments of genuine creepiness. It also packs a mean-punch of blood and gore, but we will get to that later on, continue reading further and find out what exactly THE COLLECTOR has in store.After a jump-inducing opening scene, we cut the opening credits which are highly-reminiscent of SEVEN. Then we are introduced to an ex-con handyman named Arkin (Josh Stewart) who looks like a cross between Sean Penn and Edward Norton. Arkin and many others are working on a very large house owned by some rather wealthy people. Doing things from putting bars on windows to exterminating pests, during breaks Arkin chit-chats with members of the family, getting along with them pretty well by the looks and sounds of it. Everything seems to be going along smoothly until Arkin meets up with his wife who then tells him she needs a certain amount of cash by midnight or her and their daughter will suffer terrible consequences at the hands of loan-sharks.Desperate to pay her debts, Arkin decides to rob his employer's house and get out with what's needed in order to help his own family. He goes along with his plan, however a second criminal has also targeted the property...with plans more evil than just stealing. This is where the real meat of THE COLLECTOR lies, the film goes from a drama of sorts to an atmospheric cat-and-mouse chiller. Our protagonist shifts from burglar to hero, avoiding many of the make-shift traps the killer has littered throughout the home. Trying to save the family members trapped inside, being sadistically tortured by the creep in an S&M mask with black eyes.From this point on, you will be at the edge of your seat, the house plays a good role in keeping the suspense heightened as Arkin tries to stay one step ahead of the killer. Aside from this tension given, gore-hounds are to rejoice as well, The Collector (Played with sadistic-glee by Juan Fernandez) turns the residence into a playground of terror that would make Kevin McAllister jealous with envy. I'm talking a chandelier of butcher-knives, a room of hooks, pools of acid and guillotine windows. People lose fingers, get cut-up in various brutal ways and more, this is one mean-spirited movie and I loved it.Another aspect I enjoyed was that we never got to know our killer, there is no back-story to him, he doesn't talk and there are no motives. Only that he 'collects' one person and that reason is never specified. Making him doing what he does all the more freaky, I'm sure this will all be explained in the sure-to-be sequels.The director (Marcus Dunstan) does very well for his first film, looking very-much in nature with the SAW films, from the colors to the whole-vibe of the feature. It fits the mood perfectly and some nice camera-work is also at hand, I applaud his work here.There are some flaws however, but a suspension-of-disbelief is to be had, I know it's ridiculous to think that a single man could set up so many elaborate traps in a short-time span. And some other things that I would explain but it would ruin the plot, so it does have it's moments of being inane. But the good outweighs the bad, so don't think too much and have fun with it.Overall, you'll cringe at the gore, you'll be biting your nails at the running and hiding sequences and so on. THE COLLECTOR packs brutal violence, good nude scenes, crazy booby-traps and a scary atmosphere to bring you one of the best Horror films of the year so far. Definitely recommended, check it out!",The Collector

138,nickrichardson-16919,Popcorn Empire - The Collector Movie Review,8,25 July 2019,"THROWBACK THURSDAY: THE COLLECTOR - MOVIE REVIEWThe Collector is a high concept horror film that's slick, inventive, and entertaining. 8/10The Collector is a 2009 horror film from the writers of Saw 4-6. The film was poorly received upon release, being panned by critics and receiving mixed reviews among general audiences. This film that was released at a time when the ""torture porn"" genre had worn out its welcome, and consequently was misunderstood and dismissed. While it isn't wholly original, The Collector is a high concept horror film that's slick, inventive, and entertaining.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!Clocking in at 90 minutes, this film has a very efficient script. Within the first 20 or so minutes, the movie gives out all the information you need before diving in to its gruesome concept.After a short opening sequence, we're introduced to Arkin (played by Josh Stewart), a man hired to do house work for a rich family before they go on vacation. He cases the house while simultaneously getting the know the family. After he leaves work, he visits his ex-wife and daughter. His ex-wife owes money to an unspecified party, and she explains that they'll come after them if she doesn't have the money by tomorrow. It's revealed that Arkin is an ex-con and a jewel thief. He teams up with his old crew and forms a plan to rob the house the same night, unaware that another uninvited guest is already there.What was once a normal family home becomes a house of horrors, containing a masked serial killer and a number of deadly traps. Arkin must find a way to escape with his life... and the lives of others he finds trapped inside.The concept is elevated with its stylish and creative execution. The camerawork in this film is slick and inventive, from the aerial shots of characters sneaking room to room, to the use of lighting and quick-cut editing which suddenly reveals booby traps throughout the house.The use of sound is also crucial. Long stretches contain little or no dialogue, and Arkin must sneak around the house quietly to avoid being detected. Every creak of a footstep, or a horrific scream from the basement builds the sense of tension and unease. The thunderstorm that takes place during the night plays a major role, as Arkin uses the cracks of thunder to conceal his louder actions, such as breaking a window.The torture/gore isn't constant, but this film does have some very gory scenes and is not for the squeamish, but the violence is not exploitative in this way; it adds to the terror and intimidation factor of the antagonist.The concept for this film is in and of itself scary, twisting the home invasion subgenre in a unique way. The idea of your own home becoming a death trap is unsettling, and the Collector himself is very creepy. The film leaves off on a sort of twist/cliffhanger which sets up the second film, The Collection, which might get a review in the future. If you're a horror fan, this film is definitely worth checking out.8/10",The Collector
139,proteusphi,What could go wrong??,3,27 November 2012,"What's so bad about ""The Collector""? I mean come on! The premise is intriguing and ostensibly viable: Arkin, an ex-convict trying to get back on the straight and narrow, works as a handyman for the lovable Chase family. When he his wife reveals that she needs money to pay off some loan sharks. Arkin is forced to rob the Chases to get the money. Just one problem. The Chases are a bit busy being tortured to death by a psycho in their home, which has been booby trapped with a squirm-inducing variety of death traps.Sounds awesome! Even the acting is generally great! Josh Stewart is sympathetic and believable as Arkin, and young Karley Collins does a great job as Hannah.The death traps and kills are interesting and complex, making even the most gruesome dispatching a joy to watch.Brandon Cox's cinematography is masterful, giving the film a shimmering, modern look, deftly evoking tension from scene to scene (if somewhat heavy on visual stereotypes.) Hell, even director Marcus Dunstan shows he knows what he's doing. He builds tension for a painfully long time before ever triggering the first horrible booby trap.""The Collector"" is sick, slick, and pretty to look at! So...what's wrong with it? Well for starters the story stops making sense after the first 30 minutes. I wish I could rattle off a list of the ridiculous leaps of logic and poorly thought out plot points, but it would give too much away.Trust me, by the end of the movie the characters will be behaving so nonsensically you'll wonder if you're really watching a Saturday morning cartoon.You can have all the fancy cinematography and special effects in the world, but it doesn't make a good movie. It's pretty hard to f*ck up a good screenplay and make a bad movie. But it's impossible to make a good movie out of a terrible screenplay.3 out of 10 for being an insipid piece of torture porn.",The Collector

I liked those scenes while he is in the house noticing someone else expecting to be a murdered. It was so unchilled and very scary to watch so it was done excellently but when I saw all those traps set within few hours it was so unreal - I took 2 grades of the maximum, it just spoils the horror. There is no way someone would've done so many traps in so little time and it's too sick to be real. Texas chain saw massacre is great horror, abhorrent but keeps the real out of unreal, this is way too unreal. Especially on the end, Arkin goes to wave the police and the police hit him?! Would you stand in the middle of the road, no you wouldn't. The murdered is still alive and he entered the first aid vehicle. No way, so unreal.The biggest goof you can not miss is while Arkin is in the house, he has killer boots on him self. I was very big goof.After all those unreal parts, it's just a great horror if you like tinglings but as a movie it's pretty bad.",The Collector
142,Andrelamus,An alright torture film,6,18 February 2019,"The film establishes minimal backstory and character motives before jumping into action. For this particular film, I think it works. We discover and connect with Arkin's character through his trials in the house. It's quite refreshing to see a killer without an explanation nor reason other than killing for killing's sake. And although it feels somewhat lacking not knowing anything about him, it also lets us look at him as a pure malevolent force which fits the plot well. It was suspenseful through most of it, aided by a good soundtrack which helped to amplify the tension.Albeit having multiple good and even great parts, the film lacked as a whole. It had multiple plot holes (mainly the trap setup), weak supporting characters and the most ridiculous, misplaced and silly sex scene. This is not a ground breaking film, nor even is it particularly good, it's just about alright.A recommendation for those who enjoy the torture porn genre without much story or explanation, not so much for others.",The Collector
143,joselnieves81,Worth a view from all these CGI movies!,9,13 August 2009,I have seen all the big summer blockbusters and I have to say they were good some even great but I've grown a little old on all the CGI. The Collector yes it does take away from SAW and HOSTLE but in its on way is worth a viewing. Yes the story has many plot holes and it leaves you guessing on why and how but if your a big gore and horror fan then this is the movie to see. It holds nothing back in form of gore and torture. Cheaply done and yet very well executed. No big name actors or big budget effects. In my opinion its what has been missing this summer. I would like the second part as in SAW 2 to answer all of the questions that this movie left us guessing. I look forward to seeing The Collector character again!,The Collector
144,Monoxstride,"Pretty good, but has its flaws",6,21 October 2011,"I thought this movie was pretty good, and even if it was terrible, the plot was at least somewhat original (unlike 80% of horror movies). Just for that it would get an OK rating from me. IThe action scenes were very nice, and it had some pretty exciting moments (especially in the beginning). The acting is really good, The traps are very interesting, in general it's somewhat realistic, and most of all, it's really thrilling.Now there are some pretty bad things about it too. First of all, I'm not sure what they were trying to do with the collector character, but whatever it was it didn't work very well. I have some trouble trying to accept a ""spider-human"" going around torturing people. It's actually a little bit comical. Second, MANY of the things that occurred near the end are incredibly unrealistic. Third, a lot of this movie is dependent on ALL of the characters being extremely dumb (including the collector himself). Fourth, it has possibly the worst ending I've ever seen in a movie.Another minor complaint, could they have possibly picked worse music to play in this movie? I mean wow, I dare anyone to think of a worse set of songs to put in any movie period.",The Collector
145,jez-47,Panic Room Meets Saw,7,12 February 2011,"Let's be clear about this; much of ""The Collector"" makes very little sense and the extent to which you'll need to suspend your disbelief may well influence how much enjoyment you'll get from it. However, the same is true of other recent horror greats, including ""Switchblade Romance"", ""Inside"" and ""Saw"" itself. Suffice it to say, once our hero is inside the house the tension doesn't let up for a second. It echoes Panic Room in the way Arkin light-foots his way from room to room, trying to evade the titular collector, with some nice aerial shots through the house. Similarly, the series of near misses with trip wires, spikes and all manner of nasties ratchets up the tension nicely.If you've seen ""Switchblade Romance"", you'll appreciate this stripped down, back-to-basics thriller, where the threat of violence keeps your knuckles whiter than white.The set up and ending makes little sense, but the rest of it is an extremely well-executed masterclass in fear. One to watch.",The Collector

148,garythemessage,"Disjointed, mumbled lines, silly to the extreme",3,16 October 2012,"I rented this so I could have some background before watching the sequel. ""The Collector"" was a jumbled mess. Clumsy and inept character introductions, poor acting, mumbled lines, often the darkness was simply too dark to see what was going on. If this was ""horror"" then at no time did the masked dude scare me. He was actually quite silly looking. And many of the traps were asinine, like something a 5th grader would come up with. Not scary, not thrilling, not even believable. And in the middle of all this, enter some criminal element thread that was completely disjointed from the plot. It was just cut in there, clumsy to the point of painfulness. Again, a prime opportunity for extremely poor acting and the director didn't disappoint. I admit I liked the first ""Saw"" movie, but none of the rest of them. I guess I'm just not a ""traps"" sort of movie fan. I'm a fan of solid characters and dialogue, strong plot development, believable situations, etc. Ya know, movie stuff. I tend to hold my nose and cut short films like this. Indeed, I turned it off somewhere in the middle, or perhaps two thirds of the way? I don't know. I stopped paying attention at that point. My crackers and peanut butter became more interesting.

But after sitting down and watching this I was truly amazed. This shows us how horror movies should be made. It had one best horror hero and villain ever. The hero of this film is great, it gives us reason why he is doing what he is. Then you have ""The Collector"" a treacherous villain is secertly detailed, which is brilliant. Now, the story was great. It never let me down one bit. When I watched it, the reason I had to was because of the writers of SAW. But now the story gave me great reason and the tagline ""He always take one"" is so sickly geniuos it's perfect. I wouldn't mind to have a sequel.",The Collector
150,RipTheJacker,Saw's less likable brother-in-law,6,22 February 2010,"That's the best way I can describe this film. While it has that SAW vibe to it, it doesn't necessarily feel like a SAW film, and while it was enjoyable it certainly wasn't anywhere near as good as what we've seen before. With that said, enough of the comparisons, this review is based on The Collector. The film definitely has mixed reviews, but that's normal because it's neither a great film nor a bad film. This film is simply there, and while it doesn't bring anything new to the table, it's still a decent slasher film.PROS: The film does a fine job of building up tension and releasing it with a satisfying execution, so to speak. The traps can get pretty exciting, and some come at the audience by surprise. It almost makes you wonder just what else might be hanging around the house. While it's nothing more than a slasher film, it really tries to go beyond that by adding death-traps and having victims spring into them rather than having a brainless brute stabbing people.This is what makes it so interesting, our killer is actually quite interesting and his work is very entertaining. I also like how they managed to keep the villain mysterious as to keep the audience speculating as to who it can be while subtle hints are thrown at you throughout the film. You may have an idea of who it can be by the end of the film, but fortunately the face is never revealed. The mask adds a nice touch too! CONS: It's unfortunate that the film fails to include two major details that several other horror films lack: premise & character development. Often times you pick up on major plot-holes that don't get answered by the end of the film. It's entirely up to the film-makers to develop their characters so we care and sympathize for the victims. This film tosses a rich father, a plastic mother, a slutty daughter, and an average little girl at the audience and expects everyone to care when they're attacked. I actually enjoyed their deaths simply because I didn't know anything about them and I found them to be more annoying than vulnerable. Even the killer has no background, we don't know why he's there, why he collects, why he's after the family, etc... we simply know he's there and he's dangerous.The film also lacks a premise. Again, the audience is given a scenario where a person who is robbing the rich family now has to help save that same family from another person who is out to collect. It really doesn't build up from that any longer. You are given a 90 minute showing of a thief going through one death-trap after another, and it's unfortunate that the SAW people couldn't come up with some kind of unexpected and wacky plot-twist. Plot-holes (such as how this collector managed the build and set all these traps in one night with the family still around) also dilute the film.OVERALL: While the movie has both good and bad, it certainly isn't a bad movie. Even the major issues can often be overlooked once you realize you are simply watching another horror/slasher film with a slight twist. There is plenty of blood, traps, breasts, and deaths for any horror-hound to get excited about. This film is no SAW, but if you stay away from the comparisons and treat this as another late night popcorn horror flick, you may actually sit back and enjoy it... just don't expect any major twists or anything. I gave this film a 6/10 because even with all the issues it's still enjoyable as a stand-alone slasher film.",The Collector

153,teck4201,Much better then expected,9,13 February 2010,"I had doubts when renting this movie because of the credits that had appeared on the DVD cover with writers from the SAW films. So I prepared myself for another remake. I was wrong.Yes you can see the similarities of the gadgets to the saw films but I was so glad that wasn't the main focus. I love how the villain wanted total control which what makes a psycho killer dangers in the first place thus all the traps to create a maze that only he knows the way out. Not to mention since he was the exterminator its just make sense that he was making traps for the people who was living in the house to make them feel as if they were the insects to be exterminated.There was a few loop holes like why make the traps in the first place if he already captured them. Well he didn't find the little girl so that was one reason. Maybe just in case the people escaped and the traps was a means to for back up. Either way the traps was an extent of the villains creative genius and he was taking no prisoners.Second reason why I like the movie was the burglar's character. It posed the question ""who is the bigger bad guy?"" and it was pretty obvious he was way out of his league in this one but his skills in burglary was enough for stealth action which undermined the Villain strategy. Toward the end the villain himself knew he was starting to lose control and got desperate to use the shot gun. Like I said the villain was taking no prisoners so he was going to do what ever it takes to win the game so the end was understandable. The burglar was probably the only one to have given challenged him in his own maze and capturing him was the grand prize. Over all I love the psychological game of cat and mouse. Though for once I did want the underdog to win. Still a great movie.",The Collector

155,andreas-hein1993,Refreshing and intelligent,8,24 June 2013,"The Collector was made a few years ago, and it got people attention by advertising it was made by some of the people behind Saw. Being a big fan of the first movies of the clever puzzle franchise Saw, I immediately felt the urge to watch this film. Unlike most of the recent horror movies, the collector has an intelligent and sneaky main character, who has to outwit the villain, who also appears to be very smart. Without spoiling the movie too much, i can tell that this turns into a clever game of cat and mouse, it is very tense and the movie builds up quite a bit of suspense that will keep you buried deep under your blanket, until you can hear the beloved main character is still okay.The movie does not spend a lot of time on the less important characters, which does unfortunately result in the viewer being annoyed with those characters, who does nothing but to burden the ""hero"" of the movie.The movie is fast-phased and you get thrown into the action rather quickly, after about 10-15 minutes of being presented to the surroundings, characters and conflicts. The Collector keeps the phase up as it drags you into a house of traps, with only a few seconds to figure out a safe route.This movie does not provide a lot of shocks to keep the adrenaline going, but instead it mixes gore, action and suspense, to let you know what is at stake, how easily it can go wrong and that anything can be coming next.Why should you watch this movie?If you are looking for a movie that will keep your mind on the film and make you forget about everything else for the duration of the movie. Then this is it. The movie will keep you staring at the screen like a dog waiting for food, and it only gets more and more tense as the movie progresses. If you however are not a fan of blood, or -let me warn you on this one!- if you are afraid of insect, you should probably look for entertainment elsewhere, as this movie will use some creepy torturing methods as the villain truly fancies insects.Helix Horrible Reviews",The Collector

157,thomasrobbins,"Not sure why people rate it low, you get what is advertised",7,5 January 2019,"And I am a spiritual guy, a follower of Christ, but I like many horror films. Some movies are categorized as horror that, in my opinion, need an entirely new classification. Not this movie! Within what I would call a horror genre are movies like this one, that pretty much define the genre.This is not a movie that simply relies on gruesome scenes, it adds these scenes as a necessary component of any movie that is in this category of movie.As with any ""good"" horror movie, the suspense and fear of what could happen or what seems inevitable unless some character/characters outplays the psychopath, usually at his/her own game, or by turning a seeming weakness into an advantage, or with some, the antagonist turns out to be even more ruthless and cunning when put under pressure, etc. And several other unexpected turns of course. This one hits the mark with fear and horror driven suspense, and of course the need to find out what will happen!The setting, situation, story, style, production, and atmosphere are of course also a part of a good Horror movie. Just jumping right into slaughter is, in my opinion a very poor movie. And of course we have the endgame, which often has the notorious twist as well can add to the entirity of the effect/impact.A horror movie can be terribly suspenseful, and in my opinion, makes for the best kind. However it can qualify if it is mainly just bizarre and/or include possessions, or supernatural elements, IF it is mixed with some of the above, ugly and gruesome scenes weather directly shown, or strongly implied.So in summary, many movies advertised as horror should be called something like a ""supernatural thriller"" or just plain thriller, and simply do not deliver HORROR - some have a humorous element. but this can be overdone, and the film becomes more of a spoof; a simple comic relief moment or two or ironic unforseen humorous moment can add to the feel of reality if done right.Back to those that see this movie as a bunch of gratuitous gore/violence. That has no value. I think they simply don't understand what good horror is and should not watch without seeing the trailer first!I have seen the same level of heartwrenching, and simply gruesome scenes in say, a historical trek into an area where the enemies are cannibals that like to skin their victims alive - i have seen worse gore on a TV series that is not full of jumps and shock.... or even in modern WWII movies we see this kind of gore and violence that makes the movie more genuine/I believe these folks are generally looking for a scary supernatural fantasy, with possession, or a monster doing the killing, thus relieving them of the guilt at watching another human killed in horrible ways. And I like some of these movies too, especially modern war movies, that show it like it is, but for goodness sake, watch the trailer before hand, on your streaming TV, or on IMDB/Rotten Tomatoes. before watching a horror movie and then rating it low, as you are not qualified to rate it. A rating is not just ""I don't like these kinds of movies"".Thing of the definition of Horror that applies to a film - in my mind it is a movie that contains very harsh/disturbing, and generally some good old blood and guts. A spooky/scary movie, can get away without this, but I feel should not be classified as Horror - at a minimum, we should think of it as brands of horror, and some people, like myself, think of Horror as including some elements that make you want to turn away or jump out of your skin, as you are fully aware of the horrible torture the victims will go through if nothing changes. But that alone does not make it horror - as I mentioned, you can have that in a WWII movie, but it is not horror - you need the psychopath who has murder and torture on his mind, the scary setting or setup, or a monster/possessed person whom inflicts serious and fatal damage on others.I do enjoy other movies where its more of a ghost story (I loved the book Ghost Story, scary a book as they come), but I would not call it Horror - it is definitely a type of supernatural thriller - add shocking harm to victims, and you have Horror as well. This movie was an honest to goodness fear factory with all the elements of a classic modern horror movie. But what most of us enjoy the most in these movies is the other elements I described and the suspense - the horror elements are used to jack up the fear level.",The Collector
158,NovemberKin,Porn for cannibals,1,6 February 2010,"I can't say that I review movie a lot, quite frankly I don't have the tongue or the literary skills to express myself properly.But reviewing this movie I believe I can do just.This movie might just be one of the worst things to have been made in cinematic history, in no way has it any good sides to it. This movie is just plain sickening.Script,directing,acting,cinematography and set direction are all horrendous.The movie is something in the lines of the SAW series, a maniac serial killer picks random people to kill them in the most gruesome way possible. The exception is that ""the collector"" walks in to peoples houses and sets up sadistic traps and lock them in so they have no way of escaping, furthermore the killer from what we are told throughout the movie has no motivation. No mission ala Jigsaw nor revenge, just the plainest and simplest display of sadism. We get to know that he likes spiders, and that is more or less it.We never get to know why the killer does this, we can blame it on some psychological deviation like I'm sure that many do but it is never explained like in movies like: Psycho, Silence of the lambs, Seven or even Saw.There is no connection to any of the characters whatsoever, it is like if the script was written after the writers came up with the bloodiest murders they could think of and just writing whatever to come up to that point in the movie. But I guess we can't expect more from a person who wrote the last 3 SAW movies (which are a huge decline from the first three according to me). This is a poor attempt to make a new serial killer series so teenagers can argue who would win in a fight in between Jason, Freddy and The Collector.This movie is like porn for cannibals, much like what has happened with the SAW series.I advice strongly not to watch this movie. This is the FIRST film I have ever rated 1 which I think pretty much stands for itself.",The Collector

Though upon first glance, it seems like a Saw franchise rip off, some of the torture methods were quite original, and the film had plenty of suspense, once it got into it. It was well written, to keep the suspense, torture and thrills in line. And the end was brilliantly built up in the right way for a sequel unlike some films.I think it's one of those films, where you'd have to watch it for yourself, so you can have your own opinion about the film. I'd say watch it, if your a fan of Saw, or general torture horror films, as this will set a new bar for those kind of films.",The Collector

However, once the movie really starts going it becomes apparent that each trap and related death scenes are designed to be as cringe inducing as possible. Which is all well and good, but it makes it difficult to re-watch. If you found Saw II even slightly disturbing, then this movie is definitely not for you. One particular aspect of the movie that is interesting is the insect theme but, other than a brief moment with a jar of cockroaches, it never really inspires any scenes in the movie.

161,Christian-Loescher,"A Poor Man's Saw, but Worse...",4,3 August 2009,"Name-dropping is an extremely common tactic in cinema, and much to the chagrin of movie fans who would just as soon save twenty bucks, it usually works. I suppose it would be difficult to not name-drop in some regard; how else, with the multitudes of movies many every year, would a film with no extremely well-known actors and actresses get any publicity at all? The pushers of The Collector therefore chose to highlight two individuals involved with Saw IV, V, and VI fame, no doubt hoping that Saw franchise followers, of which there are throngs, would see The Collector and make it an overnight hit. And me? Of fulfilling the name-dropping purpose, I am 100% guilty, but unfortunately, would just as soon have saved twenty bucks.The opening of the film appears promising: a man and a woman return home to find their power off, and discover a strange box in their bedroom that moves menacingly. The ending of that scene, coupled with the imagery accompanying the electronic/industrial opening soundtrack, does in fact remind of Saw, but that's where the good similarities end.The Collector's central actor Josh Stewart, who looks as if he could be Sean Penn's younger brother, plays Arkin, a longtime handyman for a rich family. Arkin's ex-wife has apparently accrued a sum of debt with loan sharks, and is relying upon Arkin to get her enough money to appease them. Arkin, utilizing his ties with associates he met while in prison, enters an agreement with said associates whereby he will rob his employer in order to get money by midnight of the day in question. As it turns out, his employer, played by Michael Reilly Burke (of the titular role in indie flick Ted Bundy), is a jewel broker, and has a safe hidden in his bedroom that contains a very large gem. We also get glimpses into the lives of Burke's screen wife and two daughters, one a teen, and one much younger. So far, so good - a story not that much out of the ordinary, and an intriguing movie intro that implies Arkin will run into similar happenstance.This is the point at which the movie's plot starts to unravel. After determining that the family would be gone on vacation, Arkin enters the home to burglarize it. Right away he is met with danger, as he hears another person enter. During Arkin's evasion of this other figure, he finds that not only is the family still at home, but they are being held and tortured, and the house is filled with traps (razor wire, acid, knives, and the like). Arkin chooses not to rob the family, but instead, attempts to save their lives from this malevolent invader. Okay, I'll buy it, but the rest had better be good.Unfortunately, clichéd scenes follow, especially akin to the Saw franchise and Hostel. Blood? Check. Gore? Check. Nudity? Check. But the main problem? None of the scenes are as inventive, scary, or gruesome as the aforementioned, a fact which would be redeemable with a thrilling story. Throughout the course of the film from the above point on, I was entertained, but only just enough to not be bored. And when The Collector came to a close, I couldn't help but think: that's it? Simply put, save your twenty bucks and your next hour-and-a-half. The Collector, though an interesting idea, fails to match its own ambition, and should only be seen by those desperate for gore before the next Saw entry.",The Collector

But when he enters the house he discovers that not only has the family not left, but they're being held captive by a man known only as The Collector. Their only hope, the con is forced to race against the clock to save the family from the madman and find the missing daughter who's hiding in the house. There's just one problem: The Collector has rigged the entire house with boobytraps intent on killing those who trip the wire.Overall, the entire thing is just too unbelievable. I couldn't even enjoy the clever mastery of the tricks, for they were too far fetched. The acting was sub-par, especially from the leading hero. He was as dry as unbuttered toast and I found myself not being able to care less if he lived or died. And it's obvious from the beginning that the movie is trying to re-invent a classic horror movie and icon so everyone dies, lamely and The Collector, while very much human, never portrays a scar.

Personally, I wasn't amused that the title hinted at something other than a slasher movie.One thing I feel the movie lacked was how Josh Stewart's character's family parallel the situation he's in. We understand that his ex-wife needs help paying for her apartment. What kind of debt, who knows? It could be anything from drugs to gambling. The movie really focuses on action that feels casual when they bring up Arkin's (Josh Stewart) family. I would like to have more understanding if that organization has to do with the antagonist. Or why someone collects people other than why they don't like you. The movie looks and feels great, the acting is there, but like I said, it feels like the movie is missing parts. I didn't like the ending because of how traditional the movie is in the slasher genre. How can some one be overpowered by someone with such a small frame? Only if he eyes glow.",The Collector

The movie was well made, well acted, well filmed, bad guy was great, but... I literally yelled at the screen three times due to the absolute stupidity of a story that made none, zero, zilch sense. How does a guy leave a house with no threats and come back maybe 4 hours later and the house has been booby trapped like the set of Saw. Also, why would it be booby trapped in the first place if the adults had already been captured. I know that as viewers we are supposed to suspend belief but this movie goes to far. I felt like not only did I need to suspend my beliefs but also my entire intellect. This is an extremely dumbed down and if you are someone who wants even a modicum of possible realism, look elsewhere. Although I gave it a 3, it would have gotten a 6 as an aforementioned well made movie but I deducted half because only those half baked will enjoy it in its present form.",The Collector

This should tell you exactly what you're getting into with this film. Granted, it's a crackerjack premise: an ex-con tries to steal a jewel from his employer's house, only to find that a serial killer has already broken into the place and laid a variety of horrifying traps. The problem is, the movie makes absolutely zero sense.** POSSIBLE SPOILERS BEGIN **You see, answer me this question: once the killer has broken into the house and tied up the family (obviously intent on killing them), why set all the traps? And boy, are these some traps - a room filled with acid, another room filled with bear traps (?), and other various ""Saw"" inspired maniacal mechanisms. Trouble is, even if you buy that there is a REASON for the traps, you'll also quickly start asking yourself a dozen other questions, like wouldn't it take this guy DAYS if not WEEKS to set these traps, instead of the 7 or 8 hours he clearly had? These and other frustrations will begin to occupy more of the mind than the plot - not a good sign.** POSSIBLE SPOILERS END **A pretty well-made film, the first by one-half of the writing team Marcus Dunstan (a nice, grainy film stock gives the pic some 80s-style horror cred), it nonetheless quickly becomes lazy and repetitive - get chased by killer, walk into new trap, find a way out, repeat. There is some nice tension, and some squirm-inducing torture, but the film essentially adds nothing new to the current crop of ""Saws"" and ""Hostels"" and the like that define the sub-genre of ""torture porn"". Again, all this description may totally get your heart a racing, because you dig some or all of these kinds of films. Look, you're talking to a guy who really dug both ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"". Trust me - you'll be disappointed. Go see a much better recent horror film called ""The Orphan"".",The Collector

From what i read, i thought i would be using my imagination most of the time. I was wrong. I should mention that i didn't know The Collector was made by the writers of some of the SAW movies either.. That would've told me all i needed to know about the gore factor. I was lucky enough to be able to fast forward some of the gore scenes. (not a fan of gore or torture)I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The first 20min of the movie are a little slow but it picks up very quickly and without notice. Yes, it's easy to see the SAW relation but this movie is able to stand on it's own.If you read the synopsis then you know what this movie is about. There's not much else to the story, just a matter of watching it play out. The only thing i predicted in the movie was the end but i didn't know how they were going to get there. This movie is suspenseful and changing every 5min. You don't know who's going to die, and when you think you do, you're probably going to be wrong.

Spoiler alert (again): There is nothing but violence and unnecessary bloodshed and despicable behavior in this movie. The hero winds up not being a hero, and not rescuing anyone (but possibly the child - but even that is not clear). Only a sadist could like this movie. I cannot believe another reviewer thought the SAW franchise was bad and this was good. At least in the SAW franchise, there was a chance of escape and there was a point to it all. There was the lesson that you should value your life. This movie had no such redeeming message, just gratuitous blood and gore!This movie was utterly depressing, because after sacrificing so much, the hero gets (spoiler alert for the third time!) recaptured at the end and has nothing to look forward to but meaningless torture at the hands of a sadist. I'd like to punch the producer and writer in the nose to let them know what a horrible disservice they've done to mankind, dragging it down just one more peg on the scale of evolution. At least they should learn from the far superior movies of SAW that there should be SOME redeeming values to movies, otherwise they should never be made as they are just a waste of our countries resources to satisfy the hollow consciences of sadists!",The Collector

183,ladypredator,The Plot,4,17 August 2009,"I've been reading a lot of comments on this movie about how there's no plot but I think there is one: The Collector was the exterminator, right? Thats what Arkin said after unmasking him and telling the cops later. Throughout the movie, there are scenes of bugs in jars and etc. He obviously LIKE BUGS! So he hates everyone who tries to kill them. In the beginning of the movie, where he got to the 1st couple, the wife was like ""What is this box doing here?"" and the husband replied: ""Maybe the ""team"" left it here."" - what team? the extermination team.Later on, when Arkin was introduced in the movie, on the job, he saw a wasp nest (was it? don't remember) and he told the exterminator, the exterminator that was probably there doing his job also. OK, another family wanting to exterminate bugs - GET THEM TONIGHT! So there's the plot, kill pplz who kill bugs that he loves oh so much.Question - Was it the same house? I think so, in the red box was the guy from the beginning. And this house is very infested with bugs.Overall, I really didn't like this movie. Besides what my theory of the plot was, a lot of the things The Collector did, didn't make sense. Like wth is with the box? And if it is the same house, how come the new family never notice there was a big red box in their closet? or never notice there was a Torturing-Saw-Scene-Hell-Hole in their basement? And how the hell is he so good at killing pplz and using knives? I think hes just some psycho-bug-loving-serial killer which they didn't really explain much about his profile in the movie.Also, the 1st couple that lived there, wasn't they report missing or something? Wouldn't the cops investigate the house and found that TSSHH in the basement?

But this movie is an insult to the genre. Icon, are you SERIOUS???? the scariest part about this killer IMO is how bad his acting is. Run thru a room full of traps and he misses them.

190,wafer-00262,NOT SCARY,3,27 February 2019,"This movie wasn't absolutely terrible but I can't justify giving more than 3/10 for a horror movie that WASN'T SCARY. Why wasn't it scary? Because the protagonist, who seems to be a fairly normal guy, struggles to convey an ounce of real fear throughout the entire movie despite it becoming evident fairly early in the movie that he is stuck in a house where people are being tortured.Putting yourself in the protagonist's shoes for just 2 seconds makes you realize that 99.9% of human beings would be so terrified in this situation that it would be hard to even move or think straight, yet this guy moves around the house almost as if he were a Navy Seal trained for this exact situation. If the person I'm watching live through the horror movie doesn't appear to be GENUINELY scared, why the hell would I be????The point that really drives the nail through the coffin is when the character finally escapes the house. Instead of running away as fast as physically possible, only looking back to ensure the psychopath isn't following him, he stops, looks back and sees that the little girl is indeed inside the house (which already should've been pretty obvious) at which point HE GOES BACK IN THE HOUSE!!!!! I'm sure the director/writer wanted the audience to react as ""Awwwww, this thief is such a nice guy that he is willing to get tortured to death just to have a chance at saving a little girl, how touching!"" But my reaction was losing any hope I had left at getting any real satisfaction from this movie. And just in case you hadn't given up hope on this guy reacting to the events of the movie like an actual human being, near the end of the movie he runs out in front of a speeding police car and gets hit instead of just waving down one of the many police cars driving by!!!I really thought this movie was going to be scary after learning of it's premise, but the protagonist's actions/reactions in the movie are so unbelievable that not only is it not scary, its not even a decent gorry action movie.

The main character (Arkin) is a little bit of a mystery at first but as the movie progresses he becomes more likable and holds the movie together well, as he needs to with so much screen time alone. The movie does take a similar line to other recent home invasion/torture thrillers, but also manages to be original at the same time. It has a definite claustrophobic feeling and will keep viewers on the edge of their seats. However this wont be everyones cup of tea. The violence is pretty extreme and is shown is all its glory(gory) but at the same time is original and inventive.

In fact, I'd never even heard of the movie until a few days before it came out. After watching the movie, I understand why. It seems as if the producers are ashamed of this movie which, by the way, was not shown to critics for some reason???? Probably because their reviews would have destroyed any hope for this movie. The storyline in this film is almost nonexistent and the little story that there is doesn't make much sense. The killer sets up multiple complicated traps throughout the house in less than ten hours. Also, where exactly is the family while he is doing this? You would think they would be home packing for their upcoming vacation. Since this is a horror movie, it is assumed that there must be at least one naked girl and one couple killed while having sex. The movie does follow through on that with a random strip club and a sex scene which ends in death.I would go on to say how terrible the end of the movie was, but the end just seemed to fit right in with the rest of the movie.

Twits and turns as the crook tries to sneak his way out, he gains a conscience and tries to help others that have been captured.

195,b-ray8,This movie was GREAT at being HORRIBLE,1,9 September 2010,"Well this movie was not at all what i had expected i have seen a lot of bad scary movies but this one tops the chart. At the first of the movie all of the characters were introduced and they were all introduced but horribly. You could tell they were reading it straight from a script it did not flow together at all it seemed very unnatural.So you learn that Arkin the main character helped refinish house for a family and the husband was a jeweler. You then find out his wife/girlfriend is in trouble with some loan sharks and he is short money to give here. So he decides to rob the house he just helped finish since he knows the family will be out of town and he knows the location of the safe. While he is cracking the safe someone comes in the house and all you see is black boots and then a leather bag. At this moment you are on the edge of your seat thinking ""wow to criminal robbing the place at the same time."" this thought was quite thrilling! The moment you get this feeling that the movie actually can turn around and be good minutes later you hit a all time low of what the F@## this sucks A@@. You find out that the family is held captive downstairs and Arkin is trying to get out of the the house but every door is locked and he goes room to room finding traps set up. Well the collector must be superman because Arkin will leave a room then come back one minute later and there is a very sophisticated trap set up with wires strung out all over.What is the point of the traps????? He already has the family..... Does this happen often that a robber is in the house the same night you trap the family so you have to set up traps to kill him....... is it every time the daughter is out late with her boyfriend and comes in the house to have sex but to be interrupted by bear traps???? or does this freak of nature get off by setting up every room with massive traps for nobody to trigger them???? Seriously this movie was full of retarded plot lines, giant cliché some want to be Saw movie. Anyways there is one hope that the ending might be a good one, from avoiding many traps and seeing members of the family die one by one he escapes with the little girl. The cops are on there way and they take off into the field towards them with the killer after them. (who by the way 10 seconds before was leveled by one of his own traps having a shandalier with 8 steak knives stab completely into his chest) Arkin runs into the road and signals for the cops to stop but for some reason they keep going plowing into him and sending him rolling into the are smashing into the road. He sees the girl standing on the side of the road looking at him just in time to see the killer pop out of the weeds and grab her!!! Where are the cops they just kept going after they plow over a man? This movie was horrible nothing at all was realistic or evenly slightly possible.

196,squonk_uk,Violent thriller with franchise written all over it,5,12 February 2011,"This is a film that deceives you and not in a good way. It's a crazy premise with a beginning that ultimately turns out to be a pretty bogus red herring. The opening 15 minutes ends up being a pathetic excuse for a set up, making you think it'll build to one thing and eventually failing because of the director and umpteen producers' desire to create the next Saw. Josh Stewart (from No Ordinary Family) plays a safe cracker who doubles up as a carpenter - this fact seems to end up being a burden rather than an aid, who also has an estranged wife and a cute daughter. He plays out a strange scene with the owner of a night club and obviously an extra curricular employer and returns to the house where we first meet him to steal a gem stone. All relatively simple and massively contrived; however just as he's about to crack the safe, someone else appears to break into the house and we're transported onto a roller-coaster of torture and some of the most explicitly nasty moments in cinema history. The main problem with this part of the film is that Stewart appears to break into the house with ease and within minutes of him doing it, the entire place has become a death trap, with bear traps, razor wire, booby traps, and just about every conceivable way to maim imaginable; yet he either didn't set one of these traps off on arrival or they all got laid in the three minutes it takes him to find the safe and begin cracking it. The next hour is just one relentless 'video nasty' but remarkably, for all the vileness, it seems to retain a soul about it, despite similarities to a number of other stalking bad men films of the last 30 years (from Halloween to the aforementioned Saw). The last 10 minutes stretch the already far-fetched story even more and will leave you with mixed emotions and potentially a bad taste in your mouth. You want a conclusion, but you don't get one; you just get a set-up for a sequel and I'm sure that after 90 minutes of a harrowing story that isn't what you want. If you like this kind of torture film, with some female flesh and some ingenious ways to die, then this is a 10 out of 10; for every one else, it only makes half that.",The Collector

I literally wish I had used my time to do something else, because the majority of the film was hard to take, and the ending sucked. Only the little girl gets out, and nothing about the main character is resolved. It made me want to punch the writer in the face. It seemed like the point at the end was that there was no redemption or justice. Further, the plot was laughable, because it was not realistic at all. There's no way someone could booby-trap a house so quickly, and the writer or director seemed intent on frustrating his/her audience.

198,steve_shubert,"Think ""Saw"" without a plot... ***MAY CONTAIN SPOILER***",2,30 July 2014,"I watched the entire ""Saw"" franchise, and while the final five (of seven) films were pretty much useless, at least the first couple had a plot...a REASON for all the carnage. ""The Collector"" was - in a nutshell - ""Saw"" without a reason for the madness. The lighting was terrible during the most important parts of the movie; the ""traps"" - which is what the movie was supposed to be centered on - were, for the most part, so poorly lit, and ill-timed that it was almost impossible to tell what was actually going on, and/or what was supposed to happen if/when the trap got sprung. But for me, what really ruined this was the loss of ANY storyline whatsoever. No reason was ever given for why. One scene described the TITLE of the movie, but again, there was never a reason given as to what drove the collector to do the things he does. In a similar vein, I got the feeling through the entire film that the producers weren't exactly sure how far they should go with the gore. There are several scenes where I expected to be totally repulsed (and let's face it: that's why we watch these things, isn't it?) but was left surprised and almost disappointed that they stopped short of showing the actual carnage. Super-fast clips, blurred shots, rapid camera movement...and you're left to wonder, ""Wait...what did I just see? Was that gross, or did I just imagine it?""The ending was almost predictable, especially if you've watched ANY slasher/gore franchises, such as the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise or the above-mentioned ""Saw"" franchise.While this movie had almost everything needed for a great horror flick, it lacked a real storyline, and it lacked any sort of real ""fear factor""...no suspense whatsoever, just like in the ""Friday the 13th"" movies. You knew going in what was going to happen; the only guessing was WHEN. It's difficult, even, to really judge the acting - there was very little real acting simply because there was very little NEED for it, and I say that without malice. It's just that the movie was that shallow.My understanding is that this movie was part of a series. (It certainly had that feeling.) I haven't seen any others, and probably won't waste my time.

We see complicated booby traps set all over the house in a matter of a short time, without anyone hearing anything or anyone suspecting anything, you would think that the people who lived in the house would hear the collector setting up knives on the chandelier, or nailing wood to cover the windows, but no. Maybe he took the people and tied them up first and then set up the traps? Who knows. This movie didn't give any sort of explanation to how he did this or his motives.

204,bobi_aa,The collector... what a great movie,9,20 April 2010,"I've just watched The Collector on a DVD and all I can say its a great film with such an awesome plot and the money I spent on it is totally justified. The plot is what dragged me to watch it , because i'm not a big fan of horror movies especially not when i heard that director was the one who made SAW... Some people might not like the ending because it's totally unexpected , but I loved it and it did shock me. This movie seems like a low budget movie , but still that did not stop it from being great. I rarely give 9/10 to a horror movie , but this one deserves it in every aspect. If you didn't like SAW movies like me and think this is something similar to it then you're wrong , this is something totally different and worth watching. Go see it yourself , you won't regret",The Collector

Later he meets his daughter and his wife that has a debt with dangerous sharks and needs money, but his week payment is not enough to pay her debts. Arkin plots to heist the safe of Michael Chase during the night to raise the necessary money. However, when he arrives in the house, he finds that a sadistic criminal has imprisoned the family and planted traps everywhere. Arkin seeks a way out of the deadly house to save his life.""Surprised to see the rating, I loved this movie! and I think it need a better rating. The plot is quite simple, but I can feel the tension when I watched this, It's way even better than 'Saw'. Even this movie is the only slash movie that I love.

My mother is and always has been a horror movie fanatic. In the 60's she took me to all the Hammer films at the theater. The 60's, 70's 80's, 90's, and the great 21st century, I've seen them all, or damn close. I can't believe this movie is getting such bad reviews. The horror movie industry has been in the toilet for the past 25 years. This is the best horror movie I've seen since Halloween 5. The key to a good horror movie is the audience must feel some type of connection to the victim. In Halloween you liked Laurie, in Halloween 4 & 5 you liked the little girl Jamie. Even in the Exorcist the audience had a connection with Regan. In Movies like Friday the 13th there is no connection to the victims, who gives a crap if they get hacked up? If there was a character in Saw viewers related to it was probably the killer Jigsaw. That does not work. If viewers did not like the fact that The Collector wasn't realistic, it was a slasher flick not a documentary. Watch the news, in real life people are tortured, murdered and diced up like potatoes. It wasn't factual, but it was real enough. I liked the character in The Collector, I wanted him to survive. THAT was what made the movie enjoyable. I felt that I was with him in the house. I wasn't emotionally dead like I am for 99.9% of other horror movies. This movie was far from disgusting. Watch the movie Header if you would like to know the definition of disgusting.

207,bvallred,Wow.,1,30 August 2010,"I signed up for IMDb just so I could vent on how much I HATE this movie. It begins with the most horrible character introductions and dialogue that I have ever heard. I can only describe it by calling it a ""scary soap opera."" My friends and I literally spent the first 15-20 minutes of the movie laughing. But we figured that wasn't why you watched horror movies anyway so we kept going with it. Then as it moved into the more intense part of the movie, it just got worse. The main character Arkin, has scoped out a house that he's going to rob to pay child support (an attempt at character development?). He goes in the house while the family is supposedly away, and in the time that it took Arkin to crack one number on their safe, the collector has managed to set elaborate traps in EVERY ROOM of the house. The next twenty minutes of the movie are spent watching Arkin wander aimlessly through the house finding the traps and making pathetic attempts to escape. Then we find out that the family is already captured inside the house! Why on earth did he set traps??? For himself?? For random burglars that are coincidentally breaking into the house at the same time (does this happen often?)?? For any teenagers that just want to have sex in the house?? How convenient! All of those happened! And just when you think that at least the ending MAY be decent, that gets ruined too! You spend 90 minutes watching this guy that you never really cared about finally escape from this house, just to watch him get smashed by the police coming to save him. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry or just punch the wall so I literally stood up and walked out of the room cursing the fact that I had just WASTED an hour and a half of life.That's how bad it was. Pathetic.",The Collector
208,nomorefaith-899-664087,An Account of how a strong premise can be mishandled,4,16 November 2010,"The Collector is an odd movie that succeeds in what it wants to do, but fails to achieve what it should be able to do.The movie does a respectable job of establishing character, and motive for the protagonist and sets up the viewer to care for his actions and their effects.After a strong start, once the setup is complete and we enter the movie fully, there is a strong element of suspense which demands viewing.The traps remain the star of the show, but without being a bore, I found myself increasingly sceptical to their feasibility which rarely occurred in SAW etc, in several instances noting that some of them would only work properly in specific situations, and in others, the antagonist seemed woefully incompetent in comparison to his ability to set up the traps in the first place.It doesn't take long for the flaws, which in so many movies can be ignored, to become so regular and glaring that it becomes hard to invest emotionally in the movie at all, and in fact, a certain amount of distaste at the plot crowbar to set itself up as a franchise.When a movie sets out to break established plot necessities, it has to be sure of doing them well, but the plot is absent of a 'heros journey', and ends poorly leaving more questions than answers.. which when done well can inspire you to question and consider everything you can see... in this case, I was inspired to make sure I avoid any sequel to this poorly thought out movie.In summary, this movie has a highly interesting premise, of a booby trapped house invaded, but once this premise has no rhyme or reason in relation to the plot, the premise is ruined, and we have nothing more than gore for gore's sake.. which is neither suspenseful nor horrifying.. merely uncomfortable.",The Collector
209,declan-979-506418,not too bad,6,17 February 2011,"I saw this film on the shelf in CEX and I thought, yeah, this looks interesting. I started watching, not with the greatest expectations as I had never heard of the film before, so I continue a bit confused with the beginning, because shortly in there's the main character Arkin in a house which I assumed HE was moving into looking at a woman which I assumed HE was married to or at least with, then a girl which I assumed was HIS daughter asks him to a tea party and then the dad comes and it turns out that Arkin was there employer and he knew that they were going on vacation, then I thought fair enough anyones mistake. Then he goes to see his daughter and the present that he gives her; she doesn't seem to be happy about it but turns out she kinda is, the mother which I assumed was HIS ex because of the way they were with each other (turns out the still together) asks him for the money he owes her so she can pay for loan sharks, so i thought a bit of a cheesy storyline to begin with but still believable. He then knows that he going to rob the house a takes a wasteful trip to a strip club where he speaks to a person I think he knew on the inside (prison) that turned out to be a waste of time and then they start randomly setting his hand on fire; I didn't get that scene and I could have been better without it, or at least have one of them turn up with him to rob the house so there not completely useless. He enters the house easily gets upstairs easily and a few cracks on the safe he hears someone coming up the stairs, this kept me on the edge of my seat and I thought will he or will he not get caught, turns out he doesn't and he's about to leave, then realising he has money to get, so he goes back up when the 'Collector' goes to the basement, and has another go on the safe. He hears screaming from the vent and the man who is his employer falls down from nowhere to make Arkin know there are traps. so I start thinking, why are there traps? what are the chances of other people entering the house? The film ends with the ambulance driving off with him in it, and what I find annoying is that there always driving on roads where there are no houses and non cars, same as Halloween 2, that frustrates me. And the character who I thought played an outstanding part and has kept me going in this film gets caught and is used for the next film ( I'm kinda guessing there will be one ) and thats the end. Good film with confusing and head scratching moments. I would recommend this film, its worth a watch and its fairly entertaining, the questions in this film such as why are there traps everywhere can be discussed upon you and friends when you go to school or college or whatever the next day.

211,rglasgow,Thoroughly mediocre,3,19 June 2010,"Let me get something out of the way - in the proper context ultra-violence is perfectly acceptable in a horror movie. Gore, if used for more than just the sake of using gore, is something that elicits an emotive response and succeeds as a film.What doesn't work is a far-fetched film that uses nothing but gore to cover flimsy characters, a nearly non-existent plot, and the standard (and by now horribly clichéd) twist (and I'll get to that later).This film's highlight are the traps; which goes to show the lack of any characterization. The main character is an ex-con with a heart of gold. A good guy trapped in a bad situation. The killer is... Mr. Faceless Killer. The family is - well, non-existent other than as squealing targets. That's all they're there for; fodder for traps.The traps themselves bring up another problem. It's one thing for a film to ask us to suspend disbelief. This film takes disbelief out back, puts it in one of the traps used in the film, and then slowly tortures it to death. What made Saw SLIGHTLY believable (and I'm a fan of believability in horror films, it adds to the terror) was that the traps were all set up in advance in deserted locations. They really could be done. These traps were, if anything, even more elaborate than that of Jigsaw. Plus the killer sets them up in, at most, a couple of hours.And then at the end. Sigh. Horror directors, understand, back in the day the bad guy winning was ""shocking"". People were tired of the good guys always getting away at the end, or defeating the BBEG. So yes, sometimes having the bad guy win added to the effect and affect of the film. However, when every horror film suddenly uses the pessimistic ""bad guy wins"" ending, that technique loses it's mojo. For the love of God, let's have a horror film where the good guys win at the end. Going into a film, and knowing a bad guy will win purely because its a horror film, really detracts from the experience and the suspense.",The Collector

I'm also surprised that the writers and director were able to keep the ending they did: I thought it would have been preview- screened out of existence.The film did take a while to get going, but when it hits its stride...phew!

It sounded creepy, entertaining and suspenseful. What I saw was one of the worst horror films I ever had to watch.My biggest problem was, that the traps were never explained. For whom did he install them in the first place? Either the family was running around as usual, then how could he rig the house. Or he had already kidnapped them, then why the traps? So that if MAYBE somebody broke in he died a horrible death? I didn't get the trap thing.What I also hated was, that the movie was stupid and bad, but seemed to take itself serious. It had so many ""Sigh, I bet now that happens!"" which came true exactly the predictable cliché way. For example, how did he make the ambulance crash? And how did he get there so fast? Besides the nice creepy touch of the ""collecting humans"" the Collector was the lamest worst horror film character in a long time.And when the credits rolled, all that happened was, that two sweet little innocent girls lost their parents (I assume the loan sharks got to the mother when he didn't deliver the money to her) and one unmenancing, a little gay, lame killer got away and will probably return for many sequels to come.",The Collector

But besides that, the movie was great as a whole. I was kept on the edge of my seat, and it was very unpredictable at many parts. Sure, there were some bad parts that should have been fixed, but that is part of a scary movie genre.At some point, the saw creators need to learn how to end the movie, but if you can survive with a mostly bad, but part good ending, I would suggest seeing it. The acting, traps, and being in a house that is completely dark is a good premise for the movie, and it works very well for the most part. I enjoyed the movie for my money. If you are a person who wants a perfect ending, do not go see it then. You will be disappointed.

219,maxzuz,Stylish but doesn't make any sense,3,26 March 2011,"Saw this flick recently, it was very stylish and well presented. I liked a lot of the camera action. It felt very stiff in the beginning though and the main character zoning out every 5 minutes started to get a bit annoying.That's the main beef I have with this film, annoying with stupid moments that doesn't make sense. You really have to let yourself go, any hint of something realistic flies out the window. The traps that the collector place out are satisfying but stupid. Somehow the people trapped in this house doesn't see the various things he's placed out in the very well lit house. There are subtle traps but some of them are too easy to spot to be something you'd miss, unfortunately the protagonist runs right into these as if he was blind. Even more annoying is the main characters odd fear for even getting close to this guy or attacking him. Somehow the Collector is so scary and super human that no one dares approach him and punch him out for the count.Several moments in the film presented tons of opportunities to kill the antagonist but the protagonist doesn't, instead he runs and hides. Oddly enough he seems to have no problem getting cut or shredded by the traps but doesn't dare go one on one with a murderer who has his back turned on him.Still the movie is rather satisfying with the kills and I have to admit I almost forgot what it felt like to see a movie without CGI. It's worth a watch if you have some time to kill but if you don't like movies like Saw with senseless torture scenes playing for several minutes. Then you might want to put this one aside and watch something else.",The Collector
220,Simbafan,"Entertaining, but far too flawed",6,9 August 2009,"Okeydoke. I just saw this about a half hour ago. WOW.**Some Spoilers Ahead!**If there's one thing that I REALLY got from this movie, other than 2 hours of torture porn, its that the SAW people have NOT lost their touch (as so shown in Saw V). Just as a note, I am a very big fan of the Saw movies (save for V, which was a big letdown) The Collector was a decent film, as far as suspense, twists, and fear go, and I'll explain why a little further down. As far as a storyline...there's almost none. Basically what you know from the trailers is the story; A guy breaks into a house to rob it, only to find that a madman known as the Collector is already there, torturing the family who lives there, and he must find a way to escape while simultaneously saving them. Granted, there's a few minor details that really don't play too much into the storyline, like the fact that Arkin (the protagonist and robber) is only robbing the house, (whose owners are his employers and his job is to help with the remodel they are currently going through)out of necessity because his wife and daughter are under threat of some loan sharks for money. The owners of the house are in possession of a stone that is worth enough to pay off the loan sharks.But thats ALL that we don't know from the trailer. Other than that, you will walk into this movie knowing EVERYTHING already. The only thing you can expect now is suspenseful moment after suspenseful moment...and gore.Did I mention the gore? This film brings it by the BUCKETS and there are rare moments when it doesn't stop. They literally leave nothing to our imaginations, which the SAW creators have prided themselves on doing. Which is why, I reiterate, the SAW creators have NOT lost their touch. I can handle gore, blood, guts, etc just fine. But this movie had me cringing in my seat. And it takes a LOT to get me to do that. So if you see this, be prepared for some gut-wrenching (pun intended) gore.I said earlier that this movie was a decent film because of the suspense, twists, and fear that it brings. This is simply because it DOESN'T END until the last moment when the credits roll. They establish Arkin's character at the beginning to where we care JUST ENOUGH that we want to know what happens to him. And so begins the labyrinth of suspenseful moments, faceless screams (for a bit anyways), diabolical booby-traps, and ""OMFG"" moments. These nonstop moments send us on an emotional roller coaster ride as we follow Arkin and wonder if he's going to make it through. That worked for the movie, which made for, while scary and gory, an entertaining movie experience.But this movie is FAR from flawless. As stated before, there is practically no storyline. That alone is a bit of a turnoff. Another is the OVERusage of gore. It was simply way over the top on this film. And then, of course, with every horror film, we, as the audience, can say ""Well so-and-so could have done...and he could have lived."" or ""There was a weapon within his reach that he could have used."" or something along those lines. In any normal horror movie, there's a few memorable moments where we think of those ideas, but it doesn't ruin the film.THIS FILM HAD TOO MANY OF THOSE MOMENTS.Just off the top of my head, I can think of over 10 instances where Arkin had a weapon at his disposal to use against the Collector, one of which was IN HIS POCKET. The diamond that he steals from the safe is about the size of his fist! USE THAT TO BASH THE COLLECTOR IN THE HEAD! ...Goosefraba...goosefraba...goosefraba (Anger Management quote for those of you who don't know) But probably the WORST factor to this film was simply the Collector himself. He left me thinking one word.WHY? Why was he doing this all? There is a moment in the film where one of the Collector's previous victims explains that ""The Collector collects people he wants and kills the rest that are unworthy."" ...well, WHY does he collect these people? What purpose does it serve? Is he just an insane madman, or does he have an actual purpose for ""collecting"" them? A villain needs a LEGITIMATE motivation for doing what he is doing other than ""Because it's scary"". I'm sorry, but THAT does not fly with me.Alrighty then. All in all, the suspense and the care for Arkin propelled this movie forward through to the end, but the lack of story being replaced with the overkill of gore and the lack of a motivation for the Collector was just too much for me. It was entertaining, but I will not be seeing this film again.",The Collector

222,aprilataylor,The movie hard core horror fans have been waiting for,9,31 July 2009,"If you're tired of all of the watered down PG-13 so-called ""horror"" movies of late and if the thought of sitting through one more remake (or ""re-imagining"" as the studios have dubbed them) makes you want to tear your hair out then The Collector will be a welcome respite. Yes, there are similarities to Saw and Hostel and yes some will deride this flick as being nothing more than the latest entry into the ""torture porn"" genre but if you're a horror fan and you let those things deter you from experiencing this film on the big screen then you're going to miss out on a truly enjoyable evening at the movies.Full disclosure: I LOVED the original Saw and have at least liked all of the sequels. I wasn't a big fan of the original Hostel and there have been several other so-called ""torture"" flicks that have elicited no response from me other than a big yawn. The writers/directors of The Collector were involved in the creation of Saw 4-6 but I think that they've done a much better job with this movie.Don't go into this flick expecting a complete retread of Saw because you're not going to get it. Sure, there's a killer who utilizes a form of traps to kill people but his methods are different. First off, he gets his own hands dirty, unlike Jigsaw, who sits back and watches from a distance. Second, redemption apparently doesn't matter to him. The major difference between The Collector and Jigsaw is that Jigsaw gives people a chance to save themselves. The Collector doesn't want you to live... unless you're the one that he's chosen to collect (see tag line, ""He always takes one"").This film has a basic plot but it's in its simplicity that it excels. There are no convoluted layers to see past (or to laugh at, as is so often the case) and the basic setup doesn't try to be anything fancy. You'll learn everything that you need to know about the main characters within the first 15 minutes and then you can just sit back and watch everything unfold.The camera work is excellent and the film comes across as extremely dark, discordant and claustrophobic. The soundtrack is perfectly in tune with the feel of the movie and really heightens the timing of each of the scares.By now I'm sure that you've heard that the film is very bloody and that's an understatement. There is nothing contained within the trailers that will prepare you for what you're going to see on the big screen. The film made everyone in the audience be they young, old, male or female, gasp at least once.If you're into gore I highly recommend that you see this film and make sure that you stay until the end of the credits.",The Collector

No it isn't great but it kept me interested. This man who wears the mask is pure evil. The main character is done well by Josh Stewart. The traps were creative, but i could tell that the writers of Saw were behind it. I can only recommend it if you enjoy really violent horror movies. I gave it a 6/10 because of the suspense, i wanted to know how it ended.

224,Shemyaza-1,The worst movie I have ever seen,1,2 July 2010,"This movie was by far one of the most horrendous I've ever seen. The plot was barely existent, the characters so extremely cliché, the antagonist looks so ridiculously stupid and has insane strength, the plot holes reveal themselves every 5 minutes, and the abysmal ending that I knew was coming when they finally escaped the house. The stupidity of the protagonist and all the other characters also.My review will contain spoilers, but trust me this movie should only be ever be watched by the most evilest people in the world So we have an ex con with a newly found attitude, who plans to break into a house that he's currently working inside of when the family plan to go on holiday, so he can pay off his girlfriends debt so ykno, shes not murdered.First plot hole. Which family tells their workers that they are going on holiday, knowing the house will be abandoned? Nevermind that, lets ignore it for now.Upon arriving at the scene, when going to work on the safe the protagonist hears footsteps, and finds the house booby trapped.Lets ignore the fact that the protagonist never seen any traps while making his way to the safe, another plot hole. But lets also concentrate on how the antagonist managed to set up so many traps in such little amount of time.It then becomes a 60 minute fest of the protagonist trying to help the family survive, escape, and having encounters with the killer multiple times.Acid that corrodes anything it touches, yet doesn't corrode the wood its on? The killer no hearing the hero of the story creeping about? The killer being intelligent enough to set up all of these traps, yet continuously steps on a floorboard giving any people who might be alluding him some indication of where he is? The killer having enough strength to throw anyone around, despite being a small guy that you see at the start of the movie. The hero having many attempts to kill him, but decides to run off.The killer getting caught in one of his own traps, a chandelier with about 5-6 nicely sized knifes, yet the killer manages to get up fine, thows it off of him without cutting himself, and if anything, is even more badass.I'll stop there, if I listed EVERY fault I'd be here typing for another hour or so, thats about under half of them.I mean, there is stretching beyond believable, and then there's really just taking the mick. This movie goes beyond everything I've ever seen. I enjoy horror and some gore as much as anyone, but what I can't stand is 2d characters that have an iq identical to their age, no plothole or reasons why the killings are happening, and being expected to believe this is realistic.The sad irony is Freddy Kreuger is far more easier to swallow and believable as to what could happen in todays world, than this movie expects you to swallow, yet this movie is supposed to be based on real life, its that bad.I suggest avoiding this movie like the plague, unless you just want to watch mindless killings happening, in which case I suggest you get help if seeing blood by someone being stabbed is what you consider good. Movies have to have some sort of character depth, realism (even in surrealistic horrors you have this), story line and above all no glaring plot holes that make it very hard to enjoy when trying to enjoy the movie.Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful.",The Collector
225,That_Crazy_Rahoda,Way TOO unsatisfying and violent for even the most avid horror fans.,3,7 August 2010,"So, I am not the type to talk through a film ever... but I found myself screaming and shouting things like ""COME THE F*CK ON!!"", ""ARE YOU SERIOUS!"" and ""WHAT THE F*CK?!!"" (I don't even use that language). This movie tortures its cast as well as its viewers and doesn't EVEN give a glimpse of the ""Collectors"" face or a sliver of the motivation for which the completely unnecessary violence takes place. I mean after watching this madman butcher these people so brutally they could at least give us a clue as to the ""why?"" -- UGH... I wanted to like this movie. I love the genre! However, I am starting to miss the subtlety that used to be involved in older scary movies. You can build suspense and scare an audience without showing 3,000 gallons of fake blood. I say save some of that money and buy some thread to sew up some of the gaping plot holes instead! I am not going to say anything more... except if you like a movie that goes WAY beyond violent, is completely unsatisfying,and not too mention ridiculously implausible or a film that after awhile you wish the cast would just die already so that it would end-- THIS IS YOUR MOVIE!",The Collector

This is NOT your everyday, run of the mill slasher movie that is equal to 90 minutes of random blood splattering.You actually think and this film makes sense, 90% of the time anyway. Most horror movies you watch and sit there thinking how stupid the protagonist is but in The Collector he actually acts as most people would in reality.The best thing about this movie is the over all creepy feeling it gives you with its realistic plot.It is without a doubt the creepiest, scariest horror movie of modern times.",The Collector

This leads us to believe that a sequel will be coming in the future.I predict that not only will this movie strictly follow Saw patterns with the same traps, same plot, and same seemingly never ending sequels, but I'm sure eventually The Collector will name someone from his collection as his heir...and then he will die. Just like Jigsaw, right? Don't get me completely wrong, the movie wasn't actually ALL bad. My sheer disappointment in the few holes in the plot and the tight resemblance to the Saw movies (which I've fallen out of liking from in the past few additions...) is the only legitimate dislike I have.Final Question- Would Arkin, a worker on the house for several days now, not notice the out of place dog as he enters the lot that night?

I was sadly mistaken. This film was a completely scary and suspenseful journey. I kept guessing what the collector collects. I was wrong each time. I would later realize the horror and disgust of what he collects and what he collects in general. Although gory at some points, the movie took the life out of me and scared me half to death. The ending was quite a twist and could not have been more unexpected. Happily there was not as much nudity and sexuality as other movies of its kind. The music was especially great as it added to the suspense and terror the movie carries. The collector injects fear into you as he sneaks around the house and Arkin discovers each and every trap that the collector has made.

I mean yeah there should be horror films where the psyco or murderer gets away but everyone who watched it with me agreed this guy should've been killed and the fish tank being spilt over to electrocute him I don't see how he knew and through other guy on it that's some psychic bull crap right there.

The creative angles, combined with flash shots, zooms and focusing tricks, it heightened the intensity. The lack of dialogue (compared to other movies that is) kept you in the moment, without distracting you by the conversations themselves. The movie also excluded much of the cheesy 'fright factors' such as the closing of a door, with the killer just waiting behind it. It was reliant on the intensity of the situation, rather then on cheap scares. The characters moved throughout the film like a dance of death through a single home throughout the entire movie, which gave it an artistic quality, not to mention nearly everyone dies, you never see the face of the killer, or discover is motives, even the main character's fate being unknown in that little twist that was just in there to get us screaming at the TV at the end of the movie, completely dissatisfied.

Throughout watching this film i felt this movie was like the type of movie made by a novice director or could be placed in the category of an independent movie which i felt didn't have the right budget as other scary movies did for the director to film. I don't know though its just the feeling i got as compared to other big hit scary movies. i may be confused with the acting, which i wasn't too happy about. Like i mentioned earlier , if it didn't have gore it would be one of the worst movies i would have ever seen in 2009!

246,bihaughs,one badass mousetrap,7,3 August 2009,"for horror movie fans, 'The Collector' has everything you would want and nothing you expect. From the writers of 'Saw 4-6' comes a new chapter in America's love affair with the sub-genre known as ""torture porn"". To me it plays more like an R-rated 'Home Alone'. You know, if Macauley Culkin's traps were made VERY effective.I was expecting a standard horror/slasher flick when taking my seat and was pleasantly surprised. the opening credits mix somewhere between the opening sequence of 'Se7en' and a Tool music video, sets up perfectly the mood in which you will spend the next hour and a half. confused but intrigued. freaked out but with a big grin on your face. there is plenty of gore for fans but not nearly as much as one would expect from graduates of the Saw school of horror. whilst our ""hero"" sneaks amongst the booby-trapped household trying not to set up a carpet of steel bear traps (awesome!) or tripwires connected to swinging blades of death (also nice), perhaps the creepiest thing in the movie is the way in which the director (sparingly) uses the killer. We rarely actually see him acting out his brutality upon his victims. But when crouched in a corner, watching two hot young teens do what they do best, and the light reflects off of the corneas of his dead eyes hidden behind that odd silk mask... yeesh! Another pleasant surprise to the film is it's use of quiet, a rarity in horror movies (especially torture porn). Most of the film's action is in hiding which means the protagonist must avoid detection at all times. There were screams in the theater, but about 89% of those were coming from the audience.I would definitely recommend this to a movie fan with a strong gut and a healthy sense of ""what's going to be behind Door #3?"" curiosity. Bonus points for being the fist movie to actually visualize the classic childhood game of ""Can't-Touch-the-Floor-Because-the-Floor-is-Hot-Lava"" well played",The Collector

The collector keeps collecting people, what should happen in the end? Somebody must find about him and stop him, this is exactly the reason why you make movies, unless you want to encourage the future generation to become collectors as well, you don't just allow a movie to end mysteriously like that.

248,redvers-whitehead,"Booby traps, torture and no real ideas.",1,1 April 2017,"This is a horror film of the home invasion/splatter type. Premise is simple, a guy goes to burgle a house to pay off his wife's debts to a loan shark and has the misfortune of arriving at the same time as a sadistic killer.The central gimmick of the film is that the killer lays an array of elaborate booby traps around the house, it's absurd, so many traps are laid in so little time, including nails protruding from the stairs and boards across the windows, things that no one could have possibly done without making some sound.Anyway the killer wears a mask, doesn't speak and takes people down into the basement of the house, which looks amazingly apt as a serial killer's torture dungeon considering it's not the killer's house. So upstairs you get people falling into booby traps and down in the basement is where the film takes its time to really dwell on the killer's sadism.That's pretty much it as far as story goes, well there's also some guy in a box who mentions that the killer kills those he doesn't want and takes those he does want for his 'collection', but this isn't developed on at all. The killer isn't interesting, just detestable in a very straight forward way. It feels like they played with the idea of having an actual concept for about 5 minutes and then just fell back on plain old sadism and gore.I'm a big fan of horror but this just seemed half-baked, a film with no ideas other than traps and ways to torture people. It's a frustrating, obnoxious film that feels like it's being rubbed in your face.Objectively I'll admit that this deserves more than 1/10, it's at least technically competent, the acting is good enough and so on, but I feel so annoyed by having wasted my time watching something that's so nasty in such an unimaginative, boring way that I'm giving it 1/10.",The Collector

250,Abolesco,A sad example of what 'horror movies' have become.,3,10 June 2011,"Before I get started I feel something needs to be said after reading some of the other reviews of this movie. I am an avid horror movie fan. For years I have watched every movie that I was made aware of. That being said, this movie was horrible. Yes, horrible.Where shall we begin? Ah yes, the plot-holes. As has been said by others, it makes zero sense that there are that many traps planted around the house. First, he had mere hours to set up dozens of elaborate traps. Second, everybody in the house was captive, save for the little girl. There was no point in setting up most of those traps, with no reason to believe he'd have a thief breaking in to foil him.The little girl. Absolutely ridiculous he never found her, considering he had to go into every room for his traps, and during the movie she had a hard time being quiet for more than a few minutes at a time once Arkin discovered her.Now the traps themselves. Two of the traps would require incredibly heavy counterweights for them to function, yet we never see anything of the sort anywhere. Even 'Home Alone' was aware of this necessity. The golf club pulled the father out of the room, down a hallway, and then over the stairs. Decent sized fellow, too. Maybe 5'10""-6', and I'd wager around 185lbs at least. To pull him like a rag doll as seen in the movie (and around corners at that) we're talking about so much more weight than Mr. Gimp could ever hide. At the very least 2000lbs counterweight would be necessary for that one, and that's massively low-balling it.Another thing.. He had his dog up outside the house, yet Arkin was perfectly able to open the door that came to have rigged deadbolts.. So, Mr. Gimp surely must have been outside the house, yet he didn't hear the dog barking at Arkin? Really? For those who might say it wasn't his dog.. it clearly attacked the little girl (and she showed no signs of recognizing it), so it must have been Mr. Gimps. Fairly glaring issue in my eyes.And the box. Ugh. I understand that they want to give the killer a trademark, but the whole premise is idiotic. He needs a distraction that HE places in the house bringing another victim into the house? Utter nonsense. Mr. Gimp needs no such distraction since he is ALREADY INSIDE. Ugh.The box actually bothers me a great deal. We are shown that this killer is intelligent. He has gloves for different situations, can improvise very effective traps in a relatively unfamiliar house, and clearly thinks through most conceivable outcomes. Yet he brings another victim into the house, and from what it seems he reuses the box. The man very clearly uses multiple ways to kill people, and as such would be very difficult for police to track his kills effectively due to a lack of any discernible MO (assuming he cleans up his traps, which I have to believe he would if it wasn't necessary to destroy the house via fire/explosion). Bringing another victim into the house leaves all sorts of evidence that would link house-to-house and make it much more likely that an eventual link would cause his capture. Now that plot-holes are more or less out of the way, lets get on to other things.First, the movie was predictable. That's no good in a horror flick. The idea is to be kept on your toes, get lost in the suspense/tension. Second, the utter lack of suspense/tension. Come on, he was in the house at the start of the second act. Anybody with any sense knows that the main character in a movie is gonna make it at the very least TO the third act, if not to the climax itself (as is the case here). There was absolutely no suspense in regards to if Arkin was gonna be killed in the house. Even when he was captured we all knew he was gonna bust loose because the movie still had ground to cover.Now onto the 'scares' of the flick. Such utter torture porn. In the most gratuitous way. I'm all for a good dose of torture, if it has a plot to back it up, but this movie was very clearly torture porn. Torture for torture's sake. The fact that they didn't even try to explain the plethora of traps, or actually tack on ANY plot other than Arkin's bad luck, shows that this movie didn't care about anything other than cheap gore-filled shocks.",The Collector
