0,TheLittleSongbird,Great potential completely buried fast,2,18 October 2017,"'The Snowman' had so much going for it. The Norwegian setting (Norway has some of the most beautiful scenery in Europe), a brilliant book, a great cast (usually can't go much wrong with Michael Fassbender and JK Simmons), the involvement of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' director Tomas Alfredson and one of the best premises of the year.Sadly, what was one of the year's films with the greatest potential and what should have been one of the best if done right turned out to be one of 2017's most disappointing and worst films. Have seen enough films this year, a hit and miss year with films on both sides of the good and bad spectrum and other in between efforts, to feel this way, before this opinion is attacked. Not in a long time has a film with so much potential start so promisingly, with one of the creepiest first 10 minutes of the year, have that potential completely melted after the opening and become increasingly buried under the snow as much as 'The Snowman'. The waste of a great premise, book, cast, opening sequence and director is unforgivable.Good things first. As said, 'The Snowman' gets off to a very promising start. The first ten minutes is genuinely creepy and atmospheric. The other redeeming quality is most of the production values, the photography is slick and stylish and makes affectionate use of beautiful and suitably chilly settings.Can say nothing good about everything else however. As an adaptation of the book, 'The Snowman' completely cuts the flesh off the bones, leaving only the bare bones of the story and characters. What was so great about the source material is removed here and executed in a way that's the complete opposite. However, any adaptation deserves to be judged on its own terms and unfortunately 'The Snowman' fails as a standalone, to me even it's even more of a failure in this regard.With a great cast on paper, 'The Snowman' should have had great performances. In reality, the performances are all round awful, even from those who are usually good or more, and sees some career-worst work from some. Michael Fassbender is a complete blank in a role he should have excelled in, it's a kind of role he's perfect at so it was a shock to see him so bad. Rebecca Ferguson is especially poor in a role that would be beneath any actress regardless of the extent of their acting ability. The chemistry between the actors, especially Fassbender and Ferguson, is frostbitten. There are also some very inconsistent accents going on. You know there's something wrong when the best and most memorable performance is given by Val Kilmer and he still unbalances the film by how bizarrely he is made to act as a character completely inconsequential to the film.In fairness a lot works against them. 'The Snowman' is directed with sluggish indifference by Alfredson, who does decently with the style but makes a complete hack job of the storytelling, which is not what one expects from him judging from his previous work. 'The Snowman' suffers from too many characters and subplots that are either under-explored (Fassbender is hindered by that the character has nothing to him in terms of development other than the type of character he is and too many of the subplots are resolved unsatisfactorily, silly or left in the air) or pointless.Regarding the script, there was a lot of awkwardness here and some chuckles that were clearly unintentional, emotional impact was as non-existent as the suspense. 'The Snowman' does an unbelievably poor job creating suspense, which is practically none after the opening, and instead lays it on thick with incredibly dull pacing, un-scary (almost listless) scares and unintentional and perplexing humour. The ending is an absolute joke, the reveal is not a surprise at all and it is further ruined by being insultingly ridiculous and illogical.While it mostly looks good, the editing is at times chaotic and the effects are shoddy. The music is okay on its own but often doesn't fit with what's going on and can be overbearing, while the sound is far too obviously used and intrusive.Overall, a huge disappointment, one of the biggest wastes of great potential in recent years. 2/10 Bethany Cox",The Snowman
1,Leofwine_draca,Behind the scenes mess up,4,28 September 2019,"THE SNOWMAN is another adaptation of a Jo Nesbo novel, this time one of his popular Harry Hole series. I had misgivings; I'd enjoyed the excellent HEADHUNTERS, but the last time Hollywood tried importing English speaking stars into a Scandinavian setting with Fincher's THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, it didn't really work. Sadly, this film appears to have suffered from a badly rushed production schedule, with many scenes left out altogether. The end result is a rushed, mixed bag affair with an overlong running time and too much boredom.The cast is pretty decent, with Michael Fassbender making an effort to portray the drunken and unpleasant aspects of Hole's character. Rebecca Ferguson and others work hard too, although some performers are distracting and there for little reason, such as Val Kilmer and Toby Jones. The direction, from the guy behind the excellent LET THE RIGHT ONE IN, is very average, and some of the CGI distracting. It takes half an hour for anything of significance to happen, and things only pick up in the last half an hour or so. A pity, because in the right hands this could have been something interesting.",The Snowman
2,SnoopyStyle,disconnections,3,24 April 2018,"A mother deliberately drives onto a frozen lake with her son. The boy escapes before the car crashes through the ice with the mother willingly waiting for death. In Oslo, expert police detective Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is approached by adoring rookie cop Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) about cases of missing women. The perpetrator leaves behind snowmen at his crime scenes.This is a disjointed muddle. I desperately try to follow every bit and pieces but things keep falling through the cracks. There are top level talents drawing the short sticks. Certainly, this movie is populated with award winning actors but everybody is wasted on this material. There are some oddly comedic scenes and I'm not sure if it's supposed to be funny. Val Kilmer is on top of that list and the fumigator has these weird jokey scenes. They stick out like sore thumbs. Harry Hole needs a new name or maybe it's another joke. More than anything, there are disconnections in the flow and the storytelling. I can see the popular criticism although this movie is not completely irredeemable. The filming looks good. The director blamed the mess on the shooting schedule but even at its best with all the pieces in place, this is a soapy pulpy rambling crime mystery thriller. The ceiling is not that high and this movie is closer to its floor.",The Snowman
3,Prismark10,Who's the daddy,4,30 June 2018,"This could easily had been a straightforward episode of Wallander (Kenneth Branagh version.)Instead Tomas Alfredson delivers a sluggish thriller with subplots that had no reason to be in the film apart from they meant to mislead the viewer. Alfredson has admitted that the film run out of money before the shooting script could be completed. It might had helped if he pared down the script.Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is an ace detective with issues. He is a drunk, he has left his family because he could not cope with them. Luckily his boss his understanding. Even his son's stepfather seems to show concern for Harry.A string of potential female abduction cases are brought to Harry's attention by a rookie cop from Bergen. A snowman is left as a calling card. Harry figures that this not just a person abducting women but a killer who has been operating for years.The killer is also taunting Harry like he taunted another drunken cop some years earlier.The icy setting of Norway gives the film a lot of initial interest despite its slow pace. This is a Scandi thriller after all. However after a while I did become restless, an hour in and nothing much was shaping up and there were all these splintered stories.By the end I had figured out the murderer but the killer's motivations made little sense as well as why some of the victims were chosen.",The Snowman
4,claudio_carvalho,"Great Thriller, Messy Screenplay",7,26 December 2017,"""The Snowman"" is a great thriller with a messy screenplay. The story is intriguing, with surprising plot points. The cast is magnificent with Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, J.K. Simmons and other stars; the former handsome Val Kilmer is impossible to be recognized. The cinematography and locations in the cold Norway are wonderful. Unfortunately the poor screenplay is confused and almost destroys the film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Boneco de Neve"" (""Snowman"")",The Snowman
5,nogodnomasters,I'll take it.,3,24 November 2017,Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is investigating the murders of mothers in Oslo. He has a partner Katrine (Rebecca Ferguson) who helps him. The killer leaves a small snowman as a calling card. The only thing the audience knows for sure is that the killer is the grown-up of the small boy we see in the first scene.The film is a very slow moving investigation going in all kind of dead end tangents that had little or nothing to do with the killings. The film had too many boring meaningless scenes for the average viewer. Not for everyone.Guide: F-word. Brief nudity.,The Snowman
6,kosmasp,More to it,7,10 March 2018,"Maybe if this was made into a series as another reviewer suggested, it would have been received better. As it is, most of it stands and falls with how you perceive the actors/characters. Because the story is solid! Though I would understand if some may feel it is too much for the running time. There are quirky things going on and a lot of weird little character traits.I do think they work and make the charme of the movie, but again it's all in the perception and how much you are willing to accept and give the movie some leeway. If that is happening, than you will be entertained by the movie and will be gripped by its suspense. Note that Val Kilmer apparently has been diagnosed with Throat Cancer. I'm only saying that, because I didn't know before I watched it and it was very irritating to see or rather hear him in his few scenes. If I hadn't read about his illness, I might have thought he was dubbed, it doesn't sound like him at all. Other than that, really good thriller with a great ending",The Snowman
7,Sleepin_Dragon,One for the forgotten pile of condemned blu rays.,4,6 April 2019,"I saw the trailers for this in the cinema, and never got round to seeing it. Gripped by the trailer I bought the blu ray, and have never been so disappointed. I can watch a bad film, that offers nothing, but this promised so much.The major problem here, is the lack of any sort of cohesion or flow with the story itself, it is so disjointed and hard to follow, that it becomes a boring watch.Michael Fassbinder is great, but that doesn't matter in such a flat, uninteresting film.The outcome of killer doesn't matter somehow, it becomes such hard work, you lose interest in it.I thought I was in for a classic, it turned out to be a mess. 4/10",The Snowman
8,lee_eisenberg,cold discomfort farm,4,4 August 2018,"I should start by noting that I've never read any of Jo Nesbø's novels (I've seen the movie version of ""Headhunters""). With that said, I hope that his novel is better than the muddled movie version of ""The Snowman"". It's a worthy effort, but it doesn't do much to draw the viewer into the story or make the viewer feel for the characters. Maybe it would've been better if filmed in its native Norwegian (as ""Headhunters"" was). It was especially jarring to see a movie set in Norway but everything's written in English! Even if it's a US-made movie...seriously, what the hell?The point is that the cast members have starred in far better movies (Steve Jobs, Florence Foster Jenkins, The Girl, Hitchcock, Boys Don't Cry, The Doors, Whiplash...and that's just a few of them), so why waste time on this?Elendig innsats!",The Snowman
9,Tweekums,"A decent, if somewhat messy, murder mystery",7,11 October 2018,"This murder mystery starts well as we see a woman kill herself in front of her son after her abusive lover leaves. Years later the son is killing people, leaving a snowman outside their houses. After receiving a cryptic letter signed with a picture of a snowman Inspector Harry Hole is given the case with new partner Katrine Bratt. It is quickly apparent that the killer is taunting the police; they are called out to find a missing woman only to find she is alive and well; minutes after they depart the killer strikes and they are called back. Intertwined with Harry's investigation we see a second, suspended detective looking for a missing woman at the behest of her husband.The first thing to say about this film is that it looks fantastic with its numerous sweeping shots of wintery Norwegian landscapes. We also get a really fine cast. Unfortunately the plot is a bit messy at times making things rather confusing. It is far from obvious that certain events we see took place years before the main events and certain plot strands don't really go anywhere... of course it could be argued that a real investigation would feature plenty of leads that lead nowhere and are then just dropped. The story provides many good tense moments, some of which don't lead to the outcome one might expect. As mentioned before the film has a fine cast; most notably Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson who play Harry and Katrine. There are also some fine actors who are really underused; it almost felt as though their characters were meant to be more important but was then reduced. Overall I'd say that this was a decent enough film but it felt as though it could be so much better; perhaps one to pick up in the bargain bucket or watch on TV.",The Snowman
10,Coventry,They went straight for the inferior remake!,5,15 March 2020,"Fact: Scandinavian people are incredibly talented when it comes to making tense, sinister, blackly comical and compelling horror/thriller cinema! There must be some kind of creativity-stimulating dust in the fresh, clean air in those countries, because the amount of awesome films, TV-series and novels coming from this part of the world is immense. Usually, the best and most successful films from Scandinavia quickly receive Hollywood remakes in which the beautiful Nordic landscapes and delightful languages are replaced with dull American ones. Recent examples include ""In Order of Disappearance"" (turned into ""Cold Pursuit"") and Thomas Alfredson's own ""Let the Right One In"" (became ""Let Me In""). With ""The Snowman"" they seemingly wanted to test a new approach, namely having the story take place in Norway, but with English-speaking and internationally acclaimed cast members supposedly portraying Norwegian characters. In other words, pretty much an attempt to skip the refreshing native original and directly make the inferior remake. It comes across as very unnatural to see Americans like Val Kilmer or J.K. Simmons act as if they were Norwegians.This is what personally bothered me the most, but strangely enough, this isn't the most frequently encountered complaint. ""The Snowman"" is not a very popular film, and most reviews criticize the lack of coherence of the plot. Admittedly it's not the greatest of its kind, and I reckon that people expect more from Thomas Alfredson and producer Martin Scorsese, but I though the plot was enjoyable enough. It's a compelling concept about a serial killer who targets married but unfaithful women and leaves a poor but creepy looking snowman behind at the place where he/she kidnaps them. Chronically depressed and borderline alcoholic police inspector Harry Hole (apparently the protagonist in a series of novels written by Jo Nesbø) investigates, with the help of a young female trainee with a seemingly hidden agenda, and also gets challenged to a cat-and-mouse game by the killer. ""The Snowman"" lacks a couple of really powerful and memorable sequences, and the denouement is also rather weak and predictable, but it's never boring and the scenery & landscapes are beautiful to look at.",The Snowman
11,michaelRokeefe,Taking another look at cold cases,4,6 July 2018,"This crime thriller has drunken self-estranged Detective Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) teaming with a rookie cop, Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson), on the Oslo police department. The pair investigate the disappearance of woman whose pink scarf is wrapped around the neck of a snowman in the first snowfall of the season in Norway. That clue leads to an exceptionally smart serial killer and a number of cold cases that share an unusual calling card...a snowman facing each murder scene. The cast also features: Jonas Karlsson, J.K. Simmons, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Toby Jones, Ronan Vibert and Val Kilmer.",The Snowman
12,CinemaSerf,"""vi går i lufta"" - Å, beklager, feil ""snømann""",4,9 December 2019,I watched this because I wanted to see what Charlotte Gainsbourg was up to nowadays. Not a lot is the answer. This ice-bound crime thriller centres around a killer who decapitates his victims and builds a snowman each time. Michael Fassbender does actually try to keep this rather ropey concept off the skids; but really to no avail. The snowscapes are great to look at - and Norway ought to get a decent tourist boost; especially around Christmas - but otherwise this has squat diddly to help keep your eyelids apart.,The Snowman
13,grantss,Intriguing but flawed,6,6 August 2018,"Harry Hole is a detective in the Oslo Police, and a highly successful one too. However, he has been having some personal problems of late, resulting in him turning to alcohol and prescription drugs. The lack of a case to solve isn't helping either. Then a woman disappears and another is murdered. This is looking like the work of a serial killer, one with a particular calling card - a snowman.Intriguing but flawed. The plot had great potential - an edgy murder-mystery with a lead character that has issues of his own. However, it fails to make the most of this potential.The sub-plots are half-baked and any character development is quite superficial. The attempts to develop Harry Hole's character, especially his relationship with his ex-girlfriend and his son, are quite cringeworthy. Throw in a host of American and British stars all trying to sound like Norwegians speaking English (wouldn't Norwegians speak Norwegian in Norway?) and it all feels very clumsy. Other than Michael Fassbender as Harry Hole, the American / British stars - Rebecca Ferguson, JK Simmons, Val Kilmer, Toby Jones, Adrian Dunbar, Chloe Sevigny - only seem there to give the film some credibility among American and British audiences. Only Ferguson has more than about 3 minutes of screentime. Val Kilmer's performance and character are so laughable they actually set the movie back.Why not have Norwegian actors speaking Norwegian, with subtitles? It would have felt much more authentic. This said, the main plot is quite intriguing and is what kept me watching despite all the negative aspects. There's a good red herring in the mix and the murderer isn't obvious until late in the piece. Plus, despite all the smokescreens and randomness that goes before, the whole thing does all come together at the end.In the end I liked it, but only just.",The Snowman
14,neil-476,Cold and a bit incoherent,6,8 May 2018,"Detective Harry Hole, aided by talented Katrine, is on the trail of a serial killer who dismembers his victims and leaves snowmen as his trademark.This crime thriller, based on a novel by Jo Nesbø, is set in and around Oslo during an extremely snowbound winter: I sat in the cinema clutching my coat round me, the movie was so cold. It is full of incident, occasionally graphic, and atmosphere, with red herrings, suspects and coincidences galore. Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson are very good.And then you come out after it ends and, if you're sensible, you don't ask yourself too many questions because as soon as you do, you realise that there is probably a good deal less to this than meets the eye, and much of it leaves you with far more questions than answers. The bits don't join together with anything like the coherence they should have. The fact that the trailer contains sequences which are not in the finished film suggests that incoherence may have originated in the editing room, though whose fault that is remains open to conjecture.This is quite involving as it goes along: the fact that there is always something happening stops you thinking too deeply. The genuinely frigid depths of a Norwegian winter mean that the film looks strikingly unusual, and it's a shame that the film is ultimately rather lame, for reasons unknown. I hope the story behind the film comes out at some point.",The Snowman
15,bombersflyup,Nothing here.,3,27 February 2019,"The Snowman is a slow monotonous mess, much like a television drama. Not a thriller, that's for sure.It's watchable, but I don't understand what they're going for here. The killer isn't a surprise.",The Snowman
16,FlashCallahan,Left me cold........,5,16 January 2018,"For Detective Harry Hole, the death of a young woman during the first snowfall of winter feels like anything but a routine murder. His investigation leads him to ""The Snowman Killer,"" a sociopath who continuously taunts Hole with his cat-and-mouse games. As the murders continue, Harry teams up with a top recruit to try and lure the madman out of the shadows before he can strike again.The Snowman had all the makings of a classic thriller which could have been mentioned in the same breath as 'Silence Of The Lambs'. Everything looked ship shape, Fassbender is a wonderful lead, the source material is thrilling, and the director showed us just how talented he is with Tinker Tailor......But, thanks to studio interference, this ends up nothing more than this thrillers that were rife in cinemas in the late nineties which usually starred Andy Garcia, Morgan Freeman, and Ashley Judd.The film doesn't really explore any character, Gole is a troubled man, a drinker who is alone but holds on to his last relationship, but he's never elaborated on here, the film would rather focus on the brilliant location and cinematography to win the audience over.Kilmer pops up in one of the most bizarre and pointless cameos of all time, dubbed, and looking a little worse for wear.When all is finally revealed, you couldn't care less about Hole, his family, or the motivations of the killer, you're just left wondering why Morgan Freeman doesn't play Alex Cross anymore.One of the biggest disappointments of the year.",The Snowman
17,deloudelouvain,Scandinavian mystery thriller,7,11 January 2018,"Why people would hate this movie is a mystery to me. The mystery element is what makes this movie interesting to watch. For the entire movie you speculate on what could be going on, on who's the killer and what are his reasons. There are enough twists and turns to make The Snowman a good movie in this genre. Maybe not the best but good enough to have a pleasant movie night. There are some good Scandinavian movies and series and this is one of them. The cast with Michael Fassbender, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Rebecca Ferguson is well chosen. They all add something special to the movie. I thought J.K.Simmons and Val Kilmer should have gotten a bigger role to make this movie even better. The horror parts were not too explicit but good enough to give you the suspense feeling. Certainly worth a watch.",The Snowman
18,JamesHitchcock,"What's the Norwegian for ""Alan Smithee""?",3,3 November 2017,"No, this is not a remake of Raymond Briggs's well-loved Christmas tale. This ""The Snowman"" is a piece of what has become known as ""Nordic Noir"". Although the Scandinavian countries have long enjoyed a reputation for being peaceful societies with a relatively low crime rate, they have also in recent years, at least in the English-speaking world, also acquired a reputation for their crime fiction. The Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was made into an excellent English-language film in 2011. (There was also a Swedish-language version which I have never seen).""The Snowman"" attempts to repeat the success of the earlier film by adapting a novel by the Norwegian writer Jo Nesbø. The lead character is the detective Harry Hole. Hole is pursuing a serial killer nicknamed ""The Snowman"" from his habit of building a snowman near the scene of each of his crimes. Each killing takes place just after the first snows of winter.I won't set out any more of the plot than that, because for much of its length the story is well-nigh incomprehensible, although some sort of meaning becomes apparent towards the end. That's not just my opinion, it seems to be the opinion of most of the critics as well. Although the film is a fairly lengthy one, it was, apparently, supposed to be even longer. According to the director Tomas Alfredson, the filming schedule was too short which meant that large chunks of the screenplay could not be shot, with the result that what actually was shot does not hang together or make a good deal of sense. What's the Norwegian for ""Alan Smithee""? The best thing about the film is Alfredson's moody, atmospheric photography of the Norwegian winter landscapes and townscapes, reminiscent of those in another, much better, neo-noir set in northern Europe, Alan Pakula's ""Gorky Park"" from the early eighties. Overall, however, the film is a waste of time and of all the talents involved, including such well-known actors (some of them employed in surprisingly minor roles) as Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Val Kilmer, Chloë Sevigny and Toby Jones. 3/10",The Snowman
19,Hellmant,Worth watching only late one night on Netflix.,6,26 October 2017,"'THE SNOWMAN': Three Stars (Out of Five)The new crime-mystery/horror flick, based on the best selling novel (of the same name) by Jo Nesbo. It tells the story of an Oslo detective, that's investigating a series of murders committed by a serial killer that uses snowmen as their calling card. It was directed by Tomas Alfredson (who also helmed the critically acclaimed thrillers 'TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY' and 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN'), and it was written by Hossein Amini, Soren Sveistrup and Peter Straughan (who also co- wrote 'TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY'). The film stars Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, J.K. Simmons, Val Kilmer, Toby Jones, Chloe Sevigny and James D'Arcy. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's a bomb at the Box Office as well. I found it to be effectively creepy at times, but it's also mostly just a bore. Harry Hole (Fassbender) is the lead detective of a special crime unit in Oslo. With the help of a new recruit, Katrine Bratt (Ferguson), he's put in charge of a missing person's case. The two later learn that a serial killer who uses snowmen as their calling card, is most likely responsible. Bratt and Hole work together to find out the killer's identity and stop his madness. The movie is really slow-paced at first, it does pick up in the second half though. It's got a very creepy, disturbing feel to it as well, and Fassbender is good in the lead. The characters aren't very well developed though, and the movie is mostly just dull. It might be worth watching late one night on Netflix still though.",The Snowman
20,thesar-2,Please Add Salt to These Wounds,2,31 December 2019,"Really...How Did This Get Made?I've promoted the fantastic How Did This Get Made? podcast on my show here many times and probably for the first time, I had to stop an episode ½ way through because...I HAD to see this disaster. They recently covered this and while I'd seen some hilarious YouTube reviews on this ""film,"" I hadn't heard their take. And...it was enough for me to finally see it.Two things they did teach me: 15-20% of the script wasn't filmed and the trailer contains many cool (ah-hem) scenes not featured in the final product. They were right. And I estimate the sad editors couldn't fit the trailer scenes in...anywhere...so they remained cut and those 15-20% lost script scenes weren't all in one shot. They HAD to be sprinkled throughout. 1% here, 3% there, 5% in the middle to really explain more and the rest throughout.Truly, this movie makes no sense and had one of the most jaw-dropping, worst edited and choppy finales of any film I've seen. It's obvious the filmmakers gave up early on, but they really had in the closing frames. I pretty much guessed who the killer was early on and when revealed, it's stupid and it's so poorly executed in the third act, you really shouldn't care by that point.While the book series might have more depth, this film did not. I have no freaking clue what this was about, throughout. Was it about a serial killer hellbent on avenging his dumb mum's suicide smile? Was it about a fake-alcoholic's plight from being jolted out of street-sleeping? Was it about people claiming young children as their own when said children continue to search for their real Daddies? Was it about Val Kilmer receiving a new voiceover?I dunno, I don't care. The ONE thing this movie had going for it: some shots were incredibly pretty in Norway. Though, you'd never know where this was filmed thanks to the non-accents.My question: If you weren't able to film crucial 15-20% scenes from the script and even more was available for a much more exciting trailer than the actual movie, scrap the movie. Don't embarrass yourself and leave this popular book series to be explored by more capable crews.Since this movie's plot is like Swiss cheese, skip it. It has some amazing shots you can see in any Google shot of Norway. So, NOT WORTH IT.***Final thoughts: ""When an elite crime squad's lead detective investigates the disappearance of a victim on the first snow of winter, he fears an elusive serial killer may be active again. With the help of a brilliant recruit, the cop must connect decades-old cold cases to the brutal new one if he hopes to outwit this unthinkable evil before the next snowfall. Written by Katrina L.

21,FeastMode,my notes,3,24 July 2019,"Pretty useless for the most part. a story you can barely latch onto or follow. their attempts at scariness or creepiness failed. and some really dumb moments and parts where you can't even tell what's happening because of bad editing. fassbendy is awesome, there were some really beautiful shots. but i couldn't wait for this movie to finish (1 viewing)",The Snowman
22,Lejink,Snow good,3,25 December 2017,"Perhaps this movie is a signpost changing tastes. I've certainly enjoyed my share of Scandi-Noir in the past, with their traits of grisly murders, flawed detectives, remote scenery and of course convoluted plots but I just found this particular movie to be particularly slow-moving, over-plotted and inscrutable.Michael Fassbinder plays lone 'tec Harry Hole who we learn early on lives a grubby existence, isn't a team player, has a difficult personal life but of course is an instinctive and brilliant sleuth. So far, so predictable. The serial killer this time takes the time and trouble to build frowning snowman at his crime scenes and then leave cryptic come-and-get-me notes as this type of killer always seems to do. In the course of his investigation, Hole cottons on that the killer's got previous as we're welcomed to a flashback sub-plot involving a previous detective played for some reason by Val Kilmer and involving a weird philanthropic businessman with a yen for young women.The plot then zig-zags and doubles back on itself as these things do, taking in the removal of various body parts by the killer, in the end leaving at least this viewer confused, frustrated and ultimately bored by the time Harry finally catches up with the hide-in-plain-perp and a highly iumprobable deliverance from harm as both skate on thin ice at the conclusion.Perhaps stretched out to the more usual 9 episodes which is de-rigeur for this sort of thing, I might have engaged more with the movie but with Fassbinder playing Hole as a cold fish and with his character's over-familiar issues with women, his ""son"" and his work colleagues, this just seemed like Danish deja-vu all over again, as the saying has it.",The Snowman
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Do you wanna build a snowman?,3,5 December 2019,"I mean... wow. I know the production was plagued with problems, to the point that the director estimates around fifteen percent of the screenplay didn't even get filmed, but... wow. 'The Snowman (2017)' is such a train-wreck, heading for disaster from the moment it begins. The opening is so bad that I'm sure I would have turned the entire affair off if I wasn't already determined to see it through to its end. It's seriously near-incomprehensible, muddled with sloppy storytelling and choppy editing. It's difficult to tell if the nonsensical narrative is actually nonsensical or if it's just edited to appear so. Thankfully, the beginning is the worst it gets. Even still, it's almost unbelievable how incoherent and inconsequential the overall piece really is. It's the kind of thing that makes you appreciate how difficult it is for a movie to even be mediocre. The amount of talent it wastes is almost inconceivable. The performances, delivered by an array of veteran actors, feel directionless and mismatched; the storytelling is incredibly straight-forward yet bizarrely strained, heavily relying on obvious ADR and unnecessary flashbacks; and the editing - oh, man, the editing - is consistently inconsistent, poorly paced and, even, downright confusing, to the point that it's nearly beyond belief frequent Scorsese collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker was involved with it in any shape or form. Plot-lines appear and then just shrivel away, most sequences are stretched out far beyond believability and some of the twists just don't make sense. The thing isn't efficient in any sense of the word. What's Val Kilmer doing? He's given nothing to work with and his subplot feels even less necessary than most of the others. Why is he even in this? The same goes for Toby Jones, who pops up in two or three scenes and doesn't do, well, anything really. Generally, as I already mentioned, the cast is wasted, overqualified yet underused. In the end, the entire feature is just bad. Everything is so overdone and over-serious that it goes beyond sincere and into silliness. The amount of apparently impactful things that come across as funny, which somehow include several gruesome murders, is laughable in itself. Thankfully, the piece isn't an absolute slog; it is, after all, rather unintentionally funny. It's also, I suppose, the absolute opposite of compelling. It doesn't even engage enough to get you mad. Instead, it just provokes apathy and the occasional bemused chuckle. It doesn't get under your skin because it doesn't even feel like a real film. It's more like a half-remembered dream, harmless and bizarre. I can recount its events but they don't take any tangible space in my brain. I can't quite describe it in any other way. As an experience, it's fine. As a film, it's awful. 3/10",The Snowman
24,ThomasDrufke,Waste of Time,3,21 October 2017,"When you make a crime-mystery-thriller, there are a few things you must do if you want to keep your audience attentive. Pace the film where the thrills are present enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, make the crime(s) impactful enough to care for the characters involved, and create a mystery that questions every turn that every character makes. The Snowman doesn't do a single one of those things.I saw the review scores before I spent my 2 hours on this film, but I love Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson enough to give them the benefit of the doubt and support their acting choices. Unfortunately, it's not them where the problems lie. Both of them are equally serviceable in their respected roles, however, the direction is absolutely lackluster to say the least. I haven't seen Tomas Alfredson's other films, but they have been acclaimed by the viewers. After seeing The Snowman, it seems like he just had no interest in telling a cohesive and well-thought out crime film. The film is overly confusing and lacks anything of interest to keep the plot going.Typically, it's make or break in terms of the lead serial killer/villain in these types of films. The ""Snowman Killer"" contains one of the laziest and nonsensical twists/reveals I have seen in quite some time. As if the movie wasn't frustrating to that point, the moment you find out who is pulling the strings really puts the movie completely over the rails.As with most bad films, I don't like wasting much energy on them, so all I'll say is that this film is a complete waste of time and opportunity. Talented actors and others are involved in the making of The Snowman, and it doesn't seem like anybody cared to bring their A- game.3.0/10",The Snowman
25,lesleyharris30,"Nothing Could Save this Mess,",1,6 December 2017,"The Snowman is a horrendous movie with a brutally developed plot and a talented cast that are completely wasted in this. For a thriller, it is immensely boring, taking it's sweet precious time to poorly develop its characters and introducing us to their world in a way that is neither interesting or exciting. The plot had so much potential and it had mislead me throughout that something big was going to happen to make me change my mind on this movie, but nothing ever does. There is literally no ""head in a box"" or ""here's Johnny"" moment that really brings it all together, it simply goes through the motions from beginning to end. There is a slew of very talented performers here, such as Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, J.K. Simmons and Val Kilmer, and it is saddening to say that they are all delivering some of their worst work. I do not blame them, there is literally nothing in their roles, Fassbender is an inactive male lead, Ferguson is very two dimensional, and I failed to find a reason as to why Simmons and Kilmer's characters were even necessary. I would rather forget this experience. Dull, boring, uninspired, The Snowman had potential to get so many things right, and got it all wrong, give it a miss.

26,inkblot11,"Not perfect, but a brave enigmatic thriller with spectacular scenery; critics wrong",8,28 September 2020,"In Norway, a young boy catches his mother in bed with ""Uncle Jonas"". The man flees, vowing never to return. Mother and son hop in a car to chase him down. Suddenly, the mother becomes catatonic, spins out over a frozen lake, and won't wake up. The son manages to escape and pleads in vain for his Mother to exit. She doesn't and, when the ice breaks, sinks and drowns. Now, quite a few number of years in the future, alcoholic detective Harry (Michael Fassbender) is nearly burned out, despite his stellar record as a man who catches the bad folks of Oslo. One of his problems is a recent breakup with a girlfriend, Rakel (Charlotte Gainsburg) and his attachment to her son, Oleg. Another is the lack of a serious case. This latter changes quickly. A newcomer detective, Katrine (Rebecca Ferguson) has recently transferred from the city of Bergen, bringing with her a case of missing females. Now, women are disappearing in Oslo, also, with eerie little snowmen left near the scenes of the crimes. When two of these victims turn up dead, Harry and Katrine join forces to try to stop what appears to be a serial killer. What Harry doesn't realize is Katrine already believes she knows who it is, a wealthy businessman named Arne (J.K.Simmons). All she has been trying to do is connect the dots, for Arne has a penchant for prostitutes provided by an Oslo doctor as the pimp. And, wouldn't you know, some of the missing women has consulted this doctor about infertility and other female related issues. Is it Arne indeed? Or is someone else the sadistic killer? Also, is there anyone connected to the tragic opening episode? This fine movie is somewhat disjointed in plot, true, going back and forth in time with confusing results. However, this doesn't really matter as the viewer never loses interest in discovering the secrets. The cast, with Fassbender in the lead, and Ferguson, Chloe Sevigny, Simmons, Gainsburg, Val Kilmer, Toby Jones, and others in attendance, is really quite wonderful. More breathtaking is the unbelievable beauty of the Norway scenery, the interesting camera work, and the totally creepy snowmen who begin to dot the crime scenes. An added plus are the motifs of a small computer with rabbit ears and a cellphone with a ringtone for Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King. If you heard this film was a failure, don't believe it. It has plenty of excitement and panache.",The Snowman

28,ops-52535,have they read the book??????????????,5,12 December 2017,"When i read the book called the snowman,ii amazed me and i swallowed it completely,and made me read all of jo nesbøs books about harry hole.they are really tremendouslly exciting crime novels. but after seeing this sightseeing film about a dark norwegian crime,i start to wonder if the scriptwriter,director and producer have read the book at all......and what they eventually have percepted from this,made a bad outcome in the product of this movie.
i do have a lot of trouble catching the line in the story,the characters are strangers ,and seems just like a bunch of incognitoes.i wish the director had used some of the tecniqs from the build up of ''real crime'' tv- series,like C.I,48 hours,snapped etc ,that shows how to make a setup that tells who, why ,what, where and when is not that difficult to do. it does in the book,why not in the film.
there are a lot of goofs and flaws to pick on ,especially some car driving locations,and when showing the speedboat HH uses to get to the island up the coast.
a car trip form oslo to the rjukan area in the end part of the film are a non oceanic drive in the eastern part of south norway,so when the film shows HH driving on the atlantic road in the northwest of southern norway,its kind of laughable to me .the location staff seems to have promotional thoughts to show what a wonderful country norway is,rather than telling the books story.
its all too narrow and too jumpy for me,i give 10 for the book and 1 for the film,a median of five,which is the number of times i guess i will need to be able to dechiffre the film.",The Snowman

He tries to find the serial killer while he has to surpass his own demons, fears while he collaborates with a brilliant recruit.I liked the movie since I ave sen the trailer of it but when I watched it, the first think that I thought it was that this movie it would be a great series. I liked the interpretation of Michael Fassbender who plays as a detective (Harry Hole) but except this I think that it's an average movie. I have to admit that I expected more from it due to the very good and interesting trailer of it. The big disappointment of this movie was that in some moments it was too boring because nothing was happening. At these points of the movie I was thinking what if this movie would be a series then each episode would last an hour and it would be very interesting at its whole duration. The direction of this film which was made by Tomas Alfredson was nice and the plot was interesting too.Finally I believe that ""The Snowman"" is a good movie to watch but it's just for spending your time. It will keep you awake because it has some interesting scenes and plot in combination with a medium to well written script but don't have high hopes on it especially if you watched the trailer. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.",The Snowman
30,cruise01,Snowman is dead in the ice that should never be revealed.,2,17 January 2018,"The Snowman is literally dead in the ice thriller that should stay buried in the ice. I am not sure what happened with this crime thriller film. Yes, the trailers look very promising with a stylish direction of a killer film with a snowman theme. Plus director Tomas Alfredson, also did the Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy film which was very good. Nearly, everything is wrong with The Snowman film unfortunately. The plot follows Detective Harry (Michael Fassbender) who receives a letter he is being watched by the snowman. A killer, who kidnaps and murders during winter. His victims all share a connection, they are usually married woman that is having an affair or failed at being a mother. Harry is going to need the help from Katrine (Rebecca Ferguson), a recruit that has been following this cold case for a decade. The only positive thing about The Snowman film is the actor involved. Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson are talented people that can only work with what they are given. But at least they tried. Fassbender plays a washed up detective, that's sleep deprived, and an alcohol addict. What did not work with the film is almost everything. The script and direction really felt like the film was missing a lot of transition scenes. Not sure, if it skips the easy transition to help ease the plot. But characters jump around a lot from one scene to another. Every scene does not feel coherent. It feels like they shot scenes and the editing were terribly put together. The way the characters interact with each other looks awkward like they are meeting for the first time even though they supposedly had history. Michael Fassbender taking his ex girlfriend son out to a concert looks like they are hanging out for the first time. The script terrible dialogue does not help as well. Then, the flashback of a decade earlier with detective Gert (Val Kilmer) also looks cheesy and the way characters behave just seemed unbelievable. Val Kilmer's performance was so bad and stale. The film does lack thrills and suspense as well. When the killer is capturing the victims and amputating body parts was quite dull. The direction does not build suspense at all. The characters are written to be awkward and flat, the plot is slow moving which seemed like the editors tried putting a dull story together. Then, a sub plot of Arve (J.K. Simmons), who takes a last minute creepy photo with his phone with attractive girls he meets also was left unresolved. Overall, The Snowman is a terrible film. Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson were good. But the direction, editing, and the script was so bad. It made the film very dull and boring, the story does not come together right and it turns out more awkward with the characters interaction. I rate the film 1 out of 5 stars. I do not recommend the film at all.",The Snowman
31,Floated2,Confusing and dull,3,4 November 2018,"The Snowman stars Michael Fassbender as a detective who is pitched as Oslo's greatest sleuth. Perhaps it's because Harry's too busy trying to find out who's going around killing various local women. Harry and his colleague, Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson), determine that the killer is targeting women who he believes have behaved immorally, whether via an affair or an abortion or what-have-you.Furthermore as a mystery, The Snowman is quite a failure as a thriller. The overall plot sounds quite intriguing but within the film, it is quite messy, dull, boring at times and overall confusing. Worse, the picture is so choppy and underdeveloped that it's near-impossible to place all the events from the killing spree (which take place over the course of a decade) in chronological order and have them make sense. When we look back in a few years, The Snowman may be remembered as the film which killed Michael Fassbender's Hollywood career.",The Snowman
32,eddie_baggins,A true oddity of bad filmmaking,2,12 February 2018,"How The Snowman became the film it ended up being will likely forever remain a great mystery of bad movie history.The Snowman's director Tomas Alfredson has publicly stated that his movie makes no sense, is missing a large percentage of its script due to filming time constraints and generally has stated that this is not the film he intended to make but that's no real excuse for the sleep inducing police thriller we get here.That The Snowman has been so universally panned and lamented is not surprising, as Alfredson is a filmmaker whose got run's on the board with brilliant vampire tale Let The Right One In and the great cold war thriller Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, but his not the only reason why so many were genuinely surprised by the downright blandness that was this adaptation of Jo Nesbø's famous series of book's.Starring Michael Fassbender (whose literally never been less charismatic or uninterested looking and is now officially in dire need of a hit) and such co-stars as J.K Simmons, Toby Jones, Val Kilmer and Rebecca Ferguson, produced by Martin Scorsese, scripted by competent screenwriters that includes Hossein Amini and even edited by Scorsese's long time editing master Thelma Schoonmaker, The Snowman has all the talent in the world and manages to squander it in a genuinely frustrating and uninvolving fashion as we slog through 2 hours of an indescribable mess of proceedings.The Snowman may not be the worst film of 2017 but it's clearly the biggest waste of potential and Alfredson's claims that some hugely important parts of the story weren't even filmed don't seem too far off the mark as characters come and disappear, important story strands are seemingly passed over, while the central story of a brutal killer building snowman with severed human heads whilst taunting Fassbender's alcoholic detective Harry Hole with letters and phone calls just never becomes even slightly thrilling or engaging against all the odds of it doing so.It's a bizarre experience witnessing a film with all the elements of being something of note and just never taking hold on any facet of its being, Alfredson ads no flair or imagination from behind the camera, Fassbender sleepwalks through his turn, Marco Beltrami's intrusive score annoys from the outset, even some badly computer generated seagulls look like they've been animated by Microsoft Paint.With everything and everyone in The Snowman failing to make a mark or even give off the vibe that they care, it makes you wonder if this was a case of no one really being truly invested in making a good film, or at the very least thinking that it would all just fall into place with the minimum effort exerted, proving that you can have all the talent assembled and still make a downright poor excuse for a feature.Final Say - Not 2017's worst film but certainly the most disappointing, The Snowman could've been (and really should've been) one of the year's best thriller's, that not only had audience's on the edge of their seats, but eagerly awaiting more Harry Hole adventures in what's clearly supposed to be a franchise set-up.What we get instead is a movie more likely to lull you into a sleep, than raise any form of interest or suspense.1 fork out of 5",The Snowman
33,leonblackwood,"Great cast, Bad movie!",3,4 March 2018,"Review:
With an impressive cast, my expectations for this movie was pretty high but now that I've watched it, I was terribly disappointed. I've quite enjoyed Michael Fassbenders movies to date but this one was a slow version of a Broadchurch episode. The beginning was promising but once the movie got going, the plot really wasn't that great, and the ending was a proper let down. Anyway, this movie sees Michael Fassbender playing a cop in Oslo, detective Harry Hole, who is an alcoholic, and divorced from his wife Rakel (Charlotte Gainsbourg). During the first snow of winter, a new recruit to the police force, Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) investigates the disappearance of a woman whose scarf is found wrapped around a weird looking snowman, with the help of Harry, who suspects that Katrine has deeper connections to the crime. After connecting all of the dots, which lead them down many different avenues, Harry finally comes face to face with the criminal, who was right under his nose all of the time but with his family in danger, he has to risk his life to take down the ruthless murderer. Believe me, it sounds better than it really is! Michael Fassbender is top form throughout the film but the storyline and the script was extremely weak. When the crime is eventually solved, it makes the rest of the film seem pointless, basically because there leads were leading them down the wrong path. The mood that was set from the beginning, made the film feel glum and pretty depressing, especially as there was a lack of interesting characters. Personally, I think that it was a waste of a good cast, and the director could have done much more with the boring plot. At the end of the day, it has to go down as a bad day at the office for Fassbender and the other leading names in the cast, and I very much doubt that were going to see a sequel. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Tomas Alfredson, 52, who also brought you Let The Right One In, and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy in 2011. The Swedish born director got big praise for Tinker but a lot of the audience that rushed to see this movie, was also thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely one of those films that looked much better during it's advertising campaign, hence why it made a profit but there just wasn't enough material to make this film interesting throughout. From a suspense point of view, I really didn't know who the murderer was, so I have to give the director props for not making it obvious but by the end of the film, I wasn't that bothered. 
With another X-Men due to be released this year, called Dark Phoenix, I'm sure that Fassbender will bounce back from this movie, and he is also starring alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger and David Hasselhoff in Kung Fury, which should raise a few eyebrows. As for Val Kilmer, I'm sure that questions will arise after his performance in this film, about his health and his weird speech. Budget: $35million

34,TheMovieDiorama,The Snowman fails to heat up as a thriller and slowly melts away into mediocrity.,5,27 February 2018,"Ahhhh what a missed opportunity this was! All the right components were there, yet somehow it completely missed the mark. A detective, with an alcohol problem, joins a newbie officer in investigating missing women. They soon realise that a pattern emerges and are embroiled in a chase with a sadistic serial killer. We've seen this a hundred times before, there is now no room for amateur thrillers anymore. None. Unfortunately for The Snowman, it is just that. Amateurish. Honestly the only memorable element that the film provides is a snowman being left at every crime scene. Some fully made out of snow, some with human body parts embedded...either way, its ludicrous. It is somewhat watchable. A slow burner with extremely inconsistent pacing, underdeveloped characters and a ridiculously anti-climatic ending...yet I can't say I was bored. The performances just about save this from being bad. Fassbender, Ferguson, Simmons and even Kilmer were good. But yikes does he look old! He's aged 20 years in the space of five! Fassbender brings some humanity, even if his character was cold as ice. The plot becomes more preposterous as it progresses but for the most part I was entertained. Not thrilling in the slightest, yet it reminded me of British TV serial dramas. I admired that approach. The screenplay was horrendously clunky, no charisma or wit at all. It's completely direct, which unfortunately does not provide any emotional connection with our protagonists. The 'twist' wasn't outrageous and I did guess the culprit halfway through but atleast it makes sense...I think? The frozen fjords of tundra Norway looked stunning. Although I've seen enough snow for one day, no more thanks. The majority of the editing was amateurish. Frequent cuts, spoken dialogue with no mouths moving...urghhh. I like thrillers, you all know I do. This should've been great, it wasn't. It left me feeling, dare I say, cold? Not the worst murder mystery I've seen, there are good things to take away from it. But...meh.",The Snowman
35,southdavid,Worth Watching? Nor-way!,2,11 March 2019,"Another film that I decided to watch as preparation for ""How Did This Get Made"" podcast, which is due to feature the 2017 flop this week.Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is a detective with the Norwegian police, who is struggling with an alcohol and insomnia problem that I can't remember if the film ever actually bothers to explain the reasons for. He's working on a case of a serial killer who likes kidnap and murder women and who likes to build a snowman, as a calling card. His partner on the case is Katrina Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) who seems pretty disinterested in the specifics of this case, and a lot more interested in investigating high profile businessman Arve Stop (JK Simmons).Plotwise, this movie is an absolute shambles. It's not the only reason for the films failure, but it's such a major one that no performance or cinematography styling could drag it back from. So many times I'm sat watching this wondering why that specific choice was made, and assuming that it's going to mean something later on, only for it not to appear in the plot again. I'm guessing that at least some of these holes might have been filled by the 15% of the film that was unshot, according to the usually talented director Tomas Alfredson. It's unusually though that it's not so much about what's missing, as to what was included. The whole plot about the businessman and his bid to win the ""Winter World Cup"" could have gone without damaging the film. His (I presume) prostitution ring (because it's never explained???) that might have been a plot point, but doesn't go anywhere. There's no reason why Katrina's character keeps her interest in the previous murders a secret, I mean, it's a conflict of interest to investigate your own father's murder, but it didn't seem like any of the rest of the force here were bothered about protocol. Did we need to actually see her father too, particularly given Kilmer's heath issues at the time? Why does Chloe Sevigny's character have a twin sister, whose only job is to say something that her sister could just have easily told the police herself? It's a parade of baffling decisions that if you told me where made up on the set to make a desired run time, I'd believe you.I've probably drifted too far into spoilers already not to post the review with the spoiler setting on anyway, so I might as well finish it off. The ending is ridiculous. They discover the link between the victims pretty early on, but if they'd just asked the obvious question about which doctor they saw, it would be over straight away. How the killer finds out where Brat is, and gets the drop on her, and knows that she's keeping all the records on her magic tablet thing are never explained and the final resolution is totally based on luck.It doesn't help that away from the plot, the film is also poor. Performances aren't good. Despite the great cast, every line feels like it's been redubbed (not just poor Kilmer's) and each time like the least engaged reading was the one they've used. Everyone's reactions to each other are odd and inconsistent. The editing is terrible too, and I think out of order, at one point I'm sure that Hole says that they're just working a missing persons cases, even though they've already found a body.Messy to the point of incoherence and yet somehow dull as watching snow melt. Abominable.",The Snowman
36,videorama-759-859391,Snowman isn't a no show,6,2 November 2017,"I love bad hype, then going to say that unfavorable movie. I can see audience's views to quite an extent. At the early stages, I was at a four out of ten, as it does a while to get the main story flowing. What The Snowman has above all else, is style. What it lacks badly is sustained suspense, with only a few nasty moments to jangle the senses, where we skip a few kills, not seeing most of them actually happened, where you think, ""What effrontery?"". I have the whole story down pat from the first frame, as I've seen it all before, and I don't want to go into it, as I will ruin it. Cool acting Michael Fassbender is great in the lead, a perfect fit as a drunken famous DCI detective, Harry Hole (love the name). He wants a case, and soon his wishes are granted, where a woman goes missing, minus a head where soon all of her is found in not so the best state. The killer always kills during snowfall and his female victims, are purposely sought out. The faceless killer, retractable netwire kit and all is his murder tool, where too, he's playing games with Harry. Charlotte Gainsborough, a great actress is again in top form as Fasssbender's ex, while Kilmer, a standout support here, another lush cop, appears in limited scenes, voice box and all, he too on the case. J.K Simmons is great too as a kind of sleazy hospital governor, while Ferguson lends strong support as Fassbender's new female partner. A few red herrings are thrown in, and the thriller elements are good, and there a score of suspects, having you go, from one to another, but overall, the film is something of a convoluted mess, with some predictabilities, one standing out like a sore thumb, as to how the killer gets it. There is some graphic gore- photos, and some unintentionally funny moments, that very short father (Fassbender) and son dollying train scene, of frankly spoken dialogue. There's a lot of things wrong with the movie, but nevertheless, this is one film, you shouldn't pass up, especially if you're a MF fan. A film that exudes in it's fresh style, one unforgettable bridge shot, and some coffee beans too",The Snowman
37,jtindahouse,A bleak experience,5,31 December 2017,"I've tried to read Jo Nesbo books before, and even made it through one or two of them, but eventually I had to give up because they were just so dull. The lead character of Harry Hole does absolutely nothing more me. A lead character in a series of books needs to be someone you can admire and aspire to be more like. Sure they need to have flaws, but their flaws shouldn't be overwhelming. So when I read somewhere that it seemed like Michael Fassbender playing Harry Hole had phoned in his performance I thought to myself I bet that isn't the case. In fact I bet he played him absolutely perfectly according to how he was written and it just seems that way because the character is so poor. Sure enough I was right. Fassbender unfortunately nailed it in a pretty awful film.The murder-mystery side of the story is actually reasonably strong and it is easy to see why they chose this as the first book to turn into a movie. It's all the in-between stuff that drags the film down. Every character is horrifically unlikeable and the direction in some scenes is beyond sloppy. I was surprised to see that this was directed by Tomas Alfredson whose work to this point has been very well received. In 'The Snowman' is felt almost amateurish at times. There was mention that this was not an ideal production so maybe that played a part.It's hard to recommend 'The Snowman' as a film to watch because it's just so bleak. I can't imagine anyone sitting down and having a really good time watching this. I'm certain there will be another entry in the Harry Hole series though so hopefully they learn their lessons from this one and improve upon them.",The Snowman

The books are written by a Norwegian named Jo Nesbo. Michael plays Harry Hole, a man with a past history of tragedy and addiction-in the form of alcoholism-who solves crimes in Norway. Women start disappearing and their bodies are found later-usually dismembered-and a recently built snowman is nearby. Rebecca is Michael's partner. They realize they have a serial killer and clues lead to older cases. One of those older cases is shown in flashback, with Val as the lead detective. FYI: I know Val has had some medical problems lately and you can tell here, with his slurred speech and just his general movements and appearance. J.K. plays a businessman with some shady appetites for younger women. The story is not bad but it is a little jerky in places, as if some scenes were left out. The whole movie is a little slow-paced, too. The movie ends with a little hint that there might be a new franchise in the works for Detective Harry Hole but unless the box-office really surprises me, I seriously doubt it.

42,kirbylee70-599-526179,Murder in Norway,7,31 January 2018,"Most won't be aware that the film THE SNOWMAN is the fourth in a series of books written by Norwegian author Jo Nesbo. The character is a nonconformist who works on the Oslo police force using unusual methods to get results. A sometime alcoholic and chain smoker he gets the job done he's assigned. And much of his back story is missing with this, the first film to feature the character even though it's based on the seventh book in the series.The film opens in the past with a man coming to visit a woman and her young son. He's instructing the young boy and bedding the mother who before he leaves threatens to tell his wife who the boy's father is. When he abruptly leaves the woman gathers her son in the car, drives out onto an ice covered lake and then allows herself to drown after he gets out of the car.Fast forward to the present where we find a man sleeping off a drunk on a park bench in the cold snowy land of Norway. He wakes and stumbles about, finally arriving at work where we discover his name is Harry Hole and he's a lead investigator for the Oslo police. The early part of the film moves along at a snail's pace and reveals bits and pieces without offering too much.A woman goes missing and left behind is a snowman in the front yard, a reference Harry notices since before he left to join the investigation a card addressed to him with a poem and drawing of a snowman was delivered. Looking deeper into the case Harry begins to think this is associated with a killing that took place years ago with a similar style, again with a snowman left behind.Several murders occur and Harry is assigned to the case along with two incompetent officers and a new recruit named Katherine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson). As each case unfolds it soon becomes apparent that they are on the track of the first serial killer in Norway. Subplots are revealed, personal reasons for Katherine to be tracing the potential involvement of a millionaire named Arve Stop (J.K. Simmons) who may be the killer and other suspects and clues are followed.Sifting through it all is Harry, dealing with issues of his own involving his teenage son and ex-wife Rakel (Charlotte Gainsbourg) as well as her new boyfriend, Mathias (Jonas Karlsson). Mathias does his best to help Rakel and the young boy when he can as well as attempting to befriend Harry as well. Several different scenes have him aiding Harry to stay connected to his son as well as offering him prescriptions to help him battle his alcoholism.More clues mount and a past case involving another investigator named Rafto (an almost unrecognizable Val Kilmer) looking into the past acts committed by this same killer helps to provide clues as to who the killer might be. Both Harry and Katherine have connections to that past case and it helps to motivate them to catch the killer this time around. With some luck they will make sure the killer doesn't have the opportunity to do so again.What could have been a very good movie instead ends up being mediocre at best. The first third of the film is so incredibly slow that it becomes a chore to watch. Bits and pieces are involved in telling us who these characters are and their motivations behind their actions but to the point of losing interest so much that you miss some of the items presented. The second act of the film is a little better, tying up those various components to make a bit more sense and offering some more clues that help the viewer get a better idea of what is going on. It isn't until the third act that things begin to make sense and move along at a more standard pace, offering a payoff by the film's end.Fassbinder felt wasted to me here. Having seen him in other films and enjoyed his performances in them I was surprised to see that he had little more to do here than act brooding, drunk or befuddled. From all I've read about the character I wouldn't associate those traits with him but that seems to be the way he's written in this screenplay. The rest of the casts fares better but not much. Well-known actors show up in bit parts and those in the lead feel under or wrongfully used.If you're going to set a film in a land covered in snow with a white or grey background for the majority of the time the action should make you ignore the setting and delve into the story. That doesn't happen here. Perhaps had they begun with the first book and let the viewer get to know the character it might have been different but that wasn't the case. The end result is a movie that's so so but that made this viewer want to seek out the source material to see if it was any better. My guess is that it was. The end result is a movie that could have been a launch for a series of films but that did so poorly hopes for that are gone.",The Snowman
43,kluseba,Under-appreciated like a fresh snowstorm,7,24 October 2017,"The Snowman is a psychological thriller based upon Jo Nesbo's critically acclaimed novel of the same name. This film received mixed to negative critics but I have to disagree. Despite a few flaws, this film is overall above average in my book. Let's take a look at what several critics had to say and compare their points to my personal experience.Many people complained that the movie didn't do the novel any justice and was missing several elements. I have to disagree because a movie can never be fully faithful to the original novel. That would also be quite unimaginative as you could simply stick to reading the novel if the movie had the very same characters, contents and dialogues. Overall, I think the movie portrayed the most important characters, events and locations and had a very appropriate length around two hours. If the movie had been longer, it would have overstayed its welcome and lost the audience's attention.Several critics say that the movie has a confusing timeline and feels incoherent. This isn't the case at all. The movie starts with an obvious and important flashback that introduces us to the serial killer and why he has become such a monster. The only other flashback shows us a police officer and later on detective in Bergen who was investigating a case related to what would turn out to be the serial killer's crimes. The content of the flashback as well as the portrayed investigator are very important for the film and add some crucial depth to it. Aside of these two flashbacks, the film has a perfectly coherent chronological order with a strong exposition, an elaborate rising action, an intense climax, a gloomy falling action and a very short resolution that doesn't overstay its welcome.I have read in many reviews that the potential of the actresses and actors isn't fully exploited. I have to disagree once more. Michael Fassbender was convincing as desperate police officer who was struggling with his alcohol addiction, his complicated family situation and the complex case. He performed this character with its credible flaws and strengths in a very authentic way. Rebecca Ferguson was just as convincing as young, energetic and dynamic officer with a mysterious hidden agenda. This actress also portrayed a credible character with amazing strengths and complex weaknesses. The supporting actresses and actors also did an excellent job from the pervert businessman to the disillusioned teenager. I would even go as far to say that this psychological thriller had some of the greatest acting performance and most interesting characters in recent memory.Add a constantly gloomy atmosphere, stunning landscapes in and around Bergen and Oslo and twisted finale and you have a very well- made genre movie.The only reasons why this movie didn't get an even better rating are the fact that the first third of the movie overstays its welcome and takes too much time to introduce characters and get the actual story started and that the story itself isn't the most original one and at times quite predictable if you are familiar with other genre movies and novels. Obviously, the source material has to be blamed for the latter downside and not the script.That being said, The Snowman is an overall enjoyable thriller with a gloomy atmosphere, stunning landscapes and great acting performances. While it might not be among this year's greatest film, one should ignore overtly harsh and biased critics and give this movie a fair chance. Genre fans should at least appreciate it.",The Snowman
44,davispittman,"Forgettable, convoluted whodunnit",3,9 July 2018,"The Snowman (2017) is a just such a mess in a lot of ways. The first problem that this film faces is not being able to hold the audiences attention. My attention really started to stray and I started to check my phone and see how much longer it had just within the first half hour. The plot is the second issue, I feel like there was some real potential here, it could've been intriguing and the plot could and should have been executed in a much more coherent fashion. They would introduce certain characters that I didn't fully understand why they were even in the film at all. And they would have short scenes that tried to explain some things but to be honest, the film was so all over the place and hard to follow that I just didn't care. The characters weren't given very much depth either, one character is kinda given a backstory but that's it. Also, the final scene is soooo dumb, something happens that i just cringed at, it was a ""seriously?"" kind of moment. This film is just all over the place and I left it thinking: ""well that just didn't make much sense"". I'm a big Fassbender fan, and he is a great actor, and to be fair he actually does well here, but him and Rebecca Ferguson are the only good things about The Snowman. 3/10.",The Snowman
45,aharmas,Just LIke Scattered Pieces,3,22 October 2017,"It's hard to believe a movie with Michael Fassbender would make me feel this frustrated. It's possible that he was as lost as most of us in the audience. Events happened with barely any relationships between them. Characters hardly tolerated being in the same scene with each other. I couldn't follow much of the story line, and I read the book. This should have been called something else or come in with a warning that said ""barely inspired by...""A serial killer is attacking a series of women and leave several clues to Harry Hole (Fassbender). He's clearly toying with him, and had it been another film we probably would have been either rooting for Fassbender or fearing for the lives of his close relatives. There's plenty of darkness, ""mood"", beautiful scenery, and potentially interesting characters, but the three responsible people for the screenplay must have been working in separate time zones or geographical locations without being able to contact each other.1) Character commits suicide. 2) Character loses a body part. 3) Characters wander around in the snow or dimly lit interiors. 4) Character can't understand the other because he/she doesn't make sense. 5) Suspense is hardly present.If the problem had been the incoherence that permeates most of the film, one would have been frustrated but some of the story changes and character substitutions don't make any sense. ""Gone With The Wind"" managed to be condensed into four hours, without losing its main points. What happened here?This film begs remake because there was something interesting and exciting, dark, and dangerous in its original concept, and it is a pity what happened to it.* out of ****(for its beautiful cinematography).",The Snowman
46,dierregi,Better than some reviews would suggest,7,5 April 2020,"This is yet another of those annoying cases of readers disappointed with movies based on novels they loved.Luckily for me, I did not read any Harry Hole novel and I had very low expectations for this film. I am also not a fan of Scandinavian crime story, which tend to be too gloomy for my taste.However, this is still acceptable. The movie opens with a puzzling scene taking place some 30 years before the main events, which contains the solution to the mystery, but also may lead you deceivingly down the wrong path.Then we move to the present and follow alcoholic Harry Hole (an emotionless Fassbender), a disgruntled Oslo police detective who seems to appreciate only difficult murder cases. He's separate from his girlfriend but takes a paternal interest in her child, Oleg.Hole meets a young and eager female cop and they start investigating the disappearance of young mothers, which may be linked to a case that happened in Bergen (another Norwegian town) years earlier.Several male characters have no other purpose than being possible suspects, while the serial killer will turn out as somebody not so obvious.A few scenes are totally irrelevant (those involving Sevigny) and the sub-plot with Hole's ex-girlfriend makes sense only towards the end, but the story is quite solid and not difficult to follow. Also, not too gory, albeit certainly not cheerful.On a side-note, ""signing"" the crimes with a snowman seems a stupid idea and certainly time-consuming. Finally, Val Kilmer is OK in his role and he was dubbed because suffering from throat cancer and unable to speak clearly.",The Snowman
47,masonsaul,A bad thriller,4,22 December 2018,"Unfortunately, The Snowman is a bad thriller. Despite really good performances from Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson and the film's beautiful visuals, it's full of plot holes and an overall lack of depth for the characters. It also wastes J. K. Simmons in a subplot that goes nowhere and is completely pointless and should have been removed.",The Snowman
48,rgkarim,That's SnowBiz For Ya,6,20 October 2017,"It's October and nothing says fall like warming your heart with a goodmurder mystery. Okay, not the most sense filled opening, but it transitions into my next review in the thriller/mystery saga of Hollywood. Tonight, we talk about the Snowman, one of the more popular installments in the Harry Hole mystery book series that swept the world. As Hollywood does, they decided to cut to the chase and bring the story to life in what they hope will be the biggest hit sensation. What lies in this cold-hearted killing flick? Robbie K here to give you the inside, without spoilers. Let's go. LIKES:Interesting concept: One thing about the world of crime is that it spans some creative ideas to put our characters up against. The Snowman creates a killer with a new calling card whose motives, like the faces on his snowmen, are cold, callous, and mysterious. This chilling concept creates the backbone of the movie, and kept me a little on edge as to what lay behind the white mask peering through the window. It has been a while since we last got such an original killer and I applaud the literary world for crafting it. Fassbender: Michael Fassbender continues to show his skills as an actor, branching his roles to yet another genre/world contained in Hollywood. I was impressed by his portrayal of Harry Hole, covering all the emotional arrays this character has on his shoulders. Hole is a struggling drug addict, trying to deal with the loss of some personal matters. Fassbender captures the drug addiction role quite well, turning those struggles into a deep seeded sadness that is only quelled by work. The suffering is well portrayed, only beaten by how well he has the detective role down as he tries to solve the crime. In truth, Fassbender just crafts a very interesting character with multiple layers, keeping you rooting for him. The Mystery: While the characters are certainly interesting, it's the actual mystery itself that will keep you engaged in at least the first half of the film. The Snowman's primary selling point is figuring out who is the wizard of frozen death and what are his motives, other than being crazy. Unlike Happy Death Day, this story has plenty of information to process, doing a nice job of keeping your mind active in pursuit of the answers. It took me about halfway to figure it out, so the challenge (unless you read the books you cheaters) are slightly more difficult and the foreshadowing is not as obvious. Thus, by using this mystery element, one remains in their seats to see the end. Scenery: Like my other reviewers, I have to give props to the camera-work in this movie, and the beautiful job done on capturing the majesty of the snowy filled cities. Sure, the soulless snowmen are creepy, as well as the unknown creator who creeps in the silent blanket. However, without the scenery there to set the deadly playing field I feel that edge would be much less. One can't help but get ""chills"" as our heroes wander the dark, quiet, frontier whose tranquility is only a mask for the threat it contains. It creates a field of isolation that is even scarier than the deranged killer. DISLIKES:Needs More suspense: The Snowman had potential in the beginning, but sadly they dropped much of the building suspense as the movie progressed. In search of a motif, a lot of drama started to bubble out, creating a convoluted (yet shallow) web of subplots that didn't need to be as detailed in the film. By getting too distracted in these elements, it took away from the thrilling chase, in a very dry attempt to develop our secondary characters. The Slow Pace: The Snowman film feels much like a book, long and drawn out with many details crammed into the mix. Had the suspense been up to par with my expectations, this would not have been a problem, but alas you feel how time creeps at parts of this movie. There were plenty of moments that could have been edited out of the film without taking away much, if anything, from the story. Without the mystery keeping me intrigued enough, this dull pace would have had me snoozing in my chair. The Weak Climax: After the long journey to get to the answer, you would hope for a strong finale. Again, The Snowman fails to deliver a satisfying conclusion, going for instead a rushed ending that tries to wrap everything up. This rapid finish first felt like they were just done with the movie, unable to come up with a justified ending. Despite the vivid mind games being dropped in this movie, the ending was a diluted, predictable mess, with a rather lazy conclusion. Worst of all though, the climax fails to fill in half the unanswered questions, relying on you to use vague sentences to piece together the overall puzzle. I'm hoping the book will answer these questions better, but making a film of the 7th book, left a lot to be desired in regards to solving all the mystery. The VERDICT: My fellow reviewers are correct in saying that the potential of this thriller was lost in this screen adaptation. Although there is an intriguing killer concept alongside a dynamic mystery, this movie just runs too slow and lacks that fulfilling punch needed in these types of films. Fassbender does his best to keep his character engaging enough to see you until the end, but it is still not enough to bring satisfaction to the award-winning book. My buddy and I agree this one is best left to home viewing/reading, holding out for next weekend to get your theater trip on. My scores:Crime/Drama/Horror: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",The Snowman
49,bkrauser-81-311064,The Snowman Sucketh,4,19 October 2017,"The trouble with The Snowman starts pretty much immediately after it starts. A young boy building a snowman looks out into the distance as a police car is approaching. Cut to the car parking. Cut to another angle of the car. Cut to a third angle; then cut to the interior of the home. Fourth angle, fifth angle, sixth, seventh, eighth – no rhyme, reason, impetus or new information comes across on the screen. The feeling evoked is not unlike getting whiplash while in park.The Snowman continues like this – shunting and sputtering through its plot like a car skating helplessly across a frozen lake. Everything needed to make this thing work is more-or-less on screen: an antihero protagonist hunting down a serial killer with a gimmick, a red herring, a moody locale, a parallel story set nine years in the past etc. But all of it is haphazardly tossed into a bleak kinda-sorta murder mystery that refuses to coagulate into anything engaging. At first it's frustrating. Than after you truly internalize the fact that no one on screen actually gives a s**t, it's actually kind of mesmerizing in a pustule popping kind of way.So what is The Snowman about? I mean, other than it being a malevolent attempt to scam a windfall ala the offices of Bialystock and Bloom. Well it stars Fassbender as an intermittently sozzled Oslo city police detective named Harry Hole (giggle). He and his new partner Katrine (Ferguson) investigate a series of deaths and disappearances that might possibly be linked to a set of murders that took place in another town nine years earlier. Their investigation then leads them on a tour of grizzly crime scenes whose clumsy staging and internal inconsistencies make them funnier as the film wears on. At one point a man's head is blown up by a shotgun and the police immediately rule suicide. ""He couldn't have shot himself at point blank range, it had to have been from an angle,"" says Hole (giggle) in a forced Anglo-Norwegian accent. ""You run your investigation, I'll run mine!"" responds his chief.The movie is like this throughout – grim looking characters pointing out the obvious while meaning and context is left completely absent. But lest you think The Snowman is merely run-of-the-mill bad, it punctuates nearly every fifteen minutes with truly bizarre choices. These choices range from near alien-like dialogue sequences to the occasional off-putting character quirk.J.K. Simmons appears at one point as a business mogul who in addition to snapping random photos of the women he likes, at one point gets his body man to proposition Katrine as he peers from the side of a curio cabinet. Because nothing says subtlety like involving three people and furniture for a sexy hotel rendezvous. And the less I say about Val Kilmer the better; the man looks like a Bull Terrier was forced to wear a Beau Bridges Halloween mask and acts though his scenes like he's being Bowfinger-ed (1999) (giggle).In a weird way, these injections of the bizarro, gift wraps this movie for a certain kind audience. Those waiting for the next Disaster Artist (2017) dissection of a uniquely awful movie need wait only a decade before Oscar Isaac is tapped to play Executive Producer Martin Scorsese. Yet for regular audiences looking for a new, atmospheric crime thriller, this thing doesn't even approach a late-nineties Ashley Judd movie. No, this thing is more like The Wicker Man (2006) remake with a slightly better cast.",The Snowman
50,shakercoola,No one can hear you scream...when the natives are out of town,4,17 June 2018,"An American crime thriller; A story about a detective investigating the disappearance of a woman whose scarf is found wrapped around an ominous-looking snowman. This Scandi-noir whodunnit is based on the Jo Nesbo novel. A grizzly, alcoholic, serial-killer-catching, rulebook-shredding, loose cannon cop is pitted against an antagonist who goes to time-consuming lengths to evade detection and capture. And yet they don't have the time to build a snowman, which serves to exemplify one of the many narrative inconsistencies along with inexplicable red herrings and arbitrary plot detours. There are questionable creative choices having an English accented cast play Norwegian locals. It is a sluggishly paced film that fails to produce enough tension at key plot turns.
As an aside, the film is not nearly as egregious as some newspaper critics' metaphorical gymnastics made out. It Norwegian setting and city vistas give it an atmosphere and there are some genuinely gruesome moments to keep the interest. Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson perform well even if some of the casting decisions are baffling.",The Snowman
51,OJT,Way better on second watch,6,13 October 2017,"The Snowman was right from the start panned with bad reviews. But I found this film was way better on the second viewing, just like Tomas Alfredsons Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy was. Exactly the same way! And that says a lot. Alfredson likes to do some subtle moves.When I saw this at a large outdoor pre-screening at the film's location Rjukan two days before the world premiere, I must admit I agreed to the rather bad reviews saying it's a 3 or 4/10. There were too many strange things which didn't make sense to me. Whatæs up with coffee bean thing? Why snowmen? Why this and that seemingly unmotivated scene? Well, I saw it again tonight, at peace with myself in a complete packed cinema, and everything was clear right from the start, though this film is in fact a murder mystery, and not a horror movie.I even found the drunken police man Val Kilmer's role quite decent the second time, and much of the acting was superb. I must admin I found Charlotte Gainsbourg over-playing a couple of times, and so with young Michael Yates as Oleg, but probably something they were asked to do.The photo is exquisite, the locations are interesting and beautiful, the cold and the feel is chilling, though i guess the film has been cut to much in the start. It's really difficult to follow what's happening in the first 1/3. More than this being a bad script or bad directing, I think it's but cut to pieces. Some parts makes no sense, before you the mystery bricks fell into place at the second view.So i really recommend those of you who have questions after the first viewing to go see it, or more likely put it on, once more. It's really not that bad at all. It's actually a quite decent serial murder mystery thriller.I also think this film is poised to be a box office success, though panned with the bad reviews, and so the makers, investors and actors will all laugh all the way to the bank. Maybe the film even will be labeled underrated in a few years. It wouldn't surprise me, now after my second view.Go see it again! And if you only saw Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy one, make sure you also watch that one also a second time. You might say with some right that a film isn't good enough if you have to watch it twice to really appreciate it, but then again that's what some might say is a mystery.",The Snowman
52,Troy_Campbell,Middle of the crime-thriller pack.,6,21 October 2017,"Based on Jo Nesbø's bestselling novel of the same name, this Oslo-set crime thriller has everything working for it: a brilliant ensemble cast, a sublimely intelligent director, a gorgeously enigmatic location, and cracking source material. It's curious then, that filmmaker Tomas Alfredson—the genius behind Let the Right One In and Tinker Tailer Solder Spy—has only managed a serviceable serial-killer mystery, rather than the genre classic it could have been. The first act does a terrific job establishing the bleak atmosphere, Norway's capital shot as a perpetually sombre city ripe for the grim murders being investigated by our drunken protagonist, Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender). Around the hour mark the plot, and the movie itself, starts to wither away; weird flashbacks to nine years earlier reveal a weak and unnecessary subplot, whilst Rebecca Ferguson's interesting supporting character is inexplicably sidelined for the final act. The requisite climactic rug-pull is present, however it's effectiveness is dampened due to rapidly waning interest levels and a lack of unpredictability. The essential elements for greatness are here and for a while it seems like it's going to deliver, but ultimately The Snowman squanders its potential to sit middle of the pack.",The Snowman

Gainsbourg does what she can with a character who never quite becomes a believable human being. And Val Kilmer is just worryingly odd.

It also contains some baffling individual scenes that contribute nothing to the plot or film as a whole.It improves as it goes along though and, contrary to what a lot of others have said, I thought the ending was relatively well done. The film is more of a mystery than a horror and it did keep me interested and guessing until the end... though I'm sure the stunning Scandinavian scenery did the film a lot of favours in terms of watchability.'The Snowman' is disappointing, but it does have some pluses and is not as bad as some are making it out to be.",The Snowman

57,one9eighty,"Not really ""flying in the air""",4,17 July 2018,"Michael Fassbender plays Harry Hole, a Norwegian detective who leads a miserable and self-destructive life - which seems to be a familiar formula if you want to be a screen detective nowadays. He's kind of tricked into opening a cold case about a serial killer by a new colleague who seems to flaunt evidence in front of him, knowing that it'll be too tempting to resist. The serial killer apparently kills on the first of the season and seems to leave a snowman as a calling card. As the investigation unfolds, Harry has to work out who his new colleague is, how she fits in with the serial killer, who the serial killer is, and how to track the serial killer before things get too nasty. With the increased popularity of TV detective series from Scandinavia and Europe over the last few years this felt like it was jumping on the bandwagon in a big way. I had no problem believing that it was based on a book by Jo Nesbo because it seemed to unfold slowly, drip feeding information, and reveals seems to feel like they would when turning the pages of a book. It felt like the film was done in chapters, because where it was tense and engaging in the first few chapters, it wasn't in the later chapters. It became lazy and occasionally confusing - I'm not saying I didn't understand it, it just felt like characters actions and motivations turned on a whim for no obvious reason. I found it obvious who the serial killer was by the middle of the film, despite the blatant attempt at film clues pointing towards other people - in fact I felt cheated having figured out who it was so early on and that's why I say it felt lazy. Nothing more so than the conclusion; it felt very much like a case of ""fart and you missed Fassbender saving the day"" and the killer meeting his fate. I didn't hate the film, but it promised so much more darkness and tension. I wanted to give this more but I can only give this a 4, I expected more and would have liked tension and thrills - for a film that's adapted from a book I'd have expected more character development and more interesting reveals too.

58,rockman182,The Snowman (2017),5,24 December 2017,"When I first heard and saw the trailer for this film, I thought it looked like a good murder mystery thriller. I was in when I saw Michael Fassbender in a leading role. I didn't get a chance to catch this in theaters but then again I heard some really terrible things about this film. I'm usually not one to go by word of mouth so I was going to watch it eventually. I wish I didn't. The film is really as messy and coherent as everyone was saying it was.The film is about a seasoned detective who must try to solve ""The Snowman Killer"" case. Decades prior similar cases occurred and now with a help of his new partner he must try to figure out who the killer is and put an end to the recent crop of killings. The film boasts quite a talented cast, which includes Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Chloe Sevigny and Charlotte Gainsbourg. All that talent, completely wasted on a mostly terrible film.The script for this film is confusing. I am certain that the film was not only rushed but a few scenes were cut out. The film feels disjointed and without a coherent flow. This really took away from the viewing experience. I wouldn't say the trailers are very misleading but I definitely was expecting a stronger film based on them. The film is mostly bereft of action, suspense, or any real tension. I heard production for the film was rushed and it shows.I think the film was aiming to be a European hit series based on a focal character (much like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) but this might have to be scrapped. I'm actually at a loss for drawing positives from this movie. Its a waste of talent and a rare misstep for Michael Fassbender. I'll give Tomas Alfredson another chance because Le The Right One In was massively entertaining. Avoid this film, its as bad as people say it was.4.5/10",The Snowman
59,carbuff,A stupid mess that shouldn't have been made and shouldn't be watched.,1,14 October 2019,"I had high hopes for ""The Snowman"", given how interesting so much Scandinavian crime fiction is. The anti-hero of this flick (Fassbender as Harry Hole) is an anti-hero to the point of being almost completely unlikable. The plot is a mishmash of countless serial killer movies that have been done to death. The scenery basically sucks. If you're going to live in a part of the world which is dark for 23 out of 24 hours, maybe such a generally sterile, colorless overall atmosphere isn't such a good idea. Getting back to the story directly, there is absolutely nothing here that you haven't seen done better many, many times before, and on TV at that. I guess some women might be drawn to Fassbender's grossly exaggerated ""troubled"" character with unspecified ""deep"" issues, but most of the rest of us will be thinking enough already. As another commentator indicated, the editor should be singled out for special blame, since he (or she or them) can only have made it worse. It's hard to imagine that this film was worse before some serious cutting was done to it. I mean, how could you possibly make this film worse. In the end, all I can really do is say don't watch ""The Snowman"". It's really that bad. I feel like one of those people who says, ""If I can save only one life, then it's worth it,"" except, in this case, instead of an entire life, we're only talking about two hours of your life.

Michael Fassbender, one of the best performers of his generation, here looks miserable and lost. The same goes for Rebecca Ferguson, for whom I've had a crush since her breakout role in Rogue Nation as Ilsa, the conflicted spy in a form-fitting yellow dress.Director Tomas Alfredson made one of my favourite spy thrillers ever, the phenomenal Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. One of the credited editors is none other than legendary Thelma Schoonmaker, long-time Scorsese collaborator and among the best in the business.So what happened? Time and money. Production was rushed, many scenes were never filmed, pacing is completely off. The result is a choppy, clunky mess; the noirish plot of a snowman-building serial killer unfolds with the elegance of a long fall downstairs.4/10",The Snowman
61,bankofmarquis,"Mis-Marketed - a ""good enough"" murder mystery, crime thriller",6,26 October 2017,"Did you know that the great Michael Fassbender is starring in a taught, tight ""hunt for the killer"" crime thriller THE SNOWMAN?If you are looking at the advertising for this film, I don't think you do. If you believe the advertising you are scratching your head wondering why Fassbender is starring in a serial killer horror flick where the bad guy stuffs the dead, dismembered bodies into Snowmen.Nothing could be further from the truth.Based on the 7th Novel in Norwegian author Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole series of crime novels, Fassbender stars as Hole - a brilliant, alcoholic detective who is brought in to solve a missing persons case that seems - at the beginning - as a crime that is beneath his abilities.  He is joined by ""new to the department"" Detective Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) who rolls her eyes to the fact that she has to ""carry"" this alcoholic through the case.As directed by Tomas Alfredson (TINKER, TAILOR, SOLDIER, SPY), THE SNOWMAN is moody and atmospheric, capturing the desolation of Norway in the winter.  Fassbender, of course, is fascinating to watch - a character with a deep past that shows on his face.The problem with this film is that it feels like the 7th story of a series - even though we are being introduced to the Fassbender character for the first time.  I felt like I am missing much, much backstory that - if I knew it - I would be much more invested in what Harry Hole is going through.As I stated, this film is ""moody and atmospheric"" - some would call it ""slow and boring"" - and I can see their point, though I caught the vibe of this film early and was okay with the leisurely pace (though I am glad I saw this in a movie theater, I don't know if I would have stayed with it had I watched it at home).  For those of you who have seen the WALLANDER Detective Series starring Kenneth Branagh on PBS, it moves at about that pace - slow.  Something about Scandanavian Detectives that brings out the slow pace, I guess.The supporting cast is competent - Ferguson, JK Simmons and Charlotte Gainsbourg are all worth watching.  And then there is the casting of Val Kilmer.  I don't know what to say about his performance but...bizarre.  I'm not really sure what he (and Director Alfredson) was going for there, but it didn't work for me.  And...maybe I'm wrong here...but I think all of his dialogue was ADR'd (dubbed-in) later on by another actor.All in all, a enjoyable (enough) murder mystery with a fine central performance by Michael Fassbender.Letter Grade:  B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",The Snowman
62,bob-the-movie-man,"""We're trudging through the slush...""",3,18 October 2017,"Unlike its animated namesake, ""The Snowman"" is not a good film. Frustratingly it has all the right ingredients:A story by bestselling Nordic writer Jo Nesbø; Gorgeously photogenic snowy scenes of Oslo and Bergen; A stellar cast (Michael Fassbender (""Alien: Covenant""); Rebecca Ferguson (""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation""); J.K. Simmons (""Whiplash""); Toby Jones (""Dad's Army""); Chloe Sevigny (""Love and Friendship""); Charlotte Gainsbourg (""Independence Day: Resurgence"", very sexy as Fassbender's ex-squeeze) and even Val Kilmer (""Top Gun"", whose mother – interesting fact – is actually Swedish).And while these elements congeal in the snow together quite well as vignettes, the whole film jerks from vignette to vignette in a most unsatisfactory way. I haven't read the book (which might be much better) but the inclusion in the (terrible!) trailers of key scenes that never made the final cut (where was the fire for example?, the fish? the man trap?) implied to me that the director (Tomas Alfredson, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"") and screen writing team – Peter Straughan (also ""Tinker, Tailor""), Hossein Amini (""The Two Faces of January"") and Søren Sveistrup (TV's ""The Killing"") – either didn't have (or didn't agree on) the direction they wanted the film to go in.Nesbø (and indeed most crime writers these days) litter their work with damaged cops. you have to question whether the detective application form has a mandatory check-box with ""alcoholic and borderline psycho"" on it!. This film is no exception. Fassbender plays Nesbø's master sleuth Harry Hole: an alcoholic insomniac well off the rails between homicide cases. ""If only Oslo had a higher murder rate"" bemoans his boss (Ronan Vibert). He joins forces with newby officer Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson), who has her fair share of mental demons to fight, in investigating a series of missing person/murder cases. The duo unearth a link between the cases – all happen when the snow starts to fall and to particular types of women, with the protagonist leaving a snowman at the scene.The plot is highly formulaic – I guessed who the killer was within about 20 minutes. But what makes this movie stand out, for all the wrong reasons, is that it has one of the most stupid, vacuous, flaccid, inane, ridiculous  (add 50 other thesaurus entries) endings imaginable. My mouth actually gaped in astonishment!There are also a surprisingly large number of loose ends you ponder after the film ends: why the ""Snowman""'s fixation with Harry?; what was with the ""Vetlesen cleaner"" subplot? How is Star Trek transportation possible in Norway? (But wait a minute... ""Telemark""... ""Teleport""... coincidence???? :-) ).On the plus side, there is some lovely Norwegian drone cinematography – (by Australian Dion Beebe (""Edge of Tomorrow"") – that immediately made me put ""travel by winter train from Oslo to Bergen"" on my life- map. The music by Marco Beltrami (""Logan"") is also effective and suitably Hitchcockian.If you like your films gory, this one is definitely for you, with some pretty graphic content that (for those who like to cover their eyes) is cut to so quickly by editors Thelma Schoonmaker (""The Wolf of Wall Street"") and Claire Simpson (""Far From The Madding Crowd"") that your hands won't have time to leave your lap! I remember this being a feature of a previous Nesbø adaptation (the much better ""Headhunters"" from 2011) but here it goes into overdrive.Overall this was a rather disappointing effort that was heading for a 5* rating. But just because of that ending I'm knocking a whole two stars off!(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook. Thanks.)",The Snowman
63,kjproulx,This Movie Needs A Lot Of Work,2,25 October 2017,"When meshing multiple genres together, it can be quite the challenge to please fans of each, but it's been done very well in the past. With the right amount of effort put, multiple genre films can be some of the best out there. Whether you're talking about Gone Girl being a Crime/Thriller or Hot Fuzz being an Action/Comedy, genre crossovers can be a real joy to see on-screen. The Snowman is the most recent film to mix genres, delivering a Horror/Thriller vibe, with a very large portion falling into the Mystery category as well. Sadly, this movie feels hollow, empty, and unfinished. With such a stellar cast and crew working on this movie, there's no reason for a movie like this to be terrible, but let me just start by saying this is one of the worst films of the year. The Snowman fails as a piece of compelling storytelling, as well as doing anything new for its genre.Starring Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, and Charlotte Gainsbourg, The Snowman follows detective Harry Hole as he investigates mysterious disappearances. Joined by detective Katrine Bratt, the two realize that the kidnapper/killer has been dismembering their victims and leaving traces in the form of snowmen. That's the simplest way to explain this film without spoiling or making it sound too ridiculous, because trust me, the twist and how the twist occurs is quite dumb in terms of storytelling. This film went through many issues when being filmed, but then why the major release? Quite honestly, this film deserved to be sent straight to home video, because everything from its clunky screenplay to its choppy editing felt off.Your movie makes it into post-production and is now being made into the best possible version it can be (hopefully), so why is it that it still turns out to look like a two-hour trailer that breezes past crucial plot points? There are multiple occasions throughout the course of this film that sequences feel missing. Although certain reveals are easily spottable throughout the first two acts, the movie asks you to patiently wait until the final 15-20 minutes in order to really invest yourself in the plot twists. That would've been fine if the story kept you on the edge of your seat, but not much of anything is truly that interesting throughout the first two acts. Yes, the premise itself could've lent itself to an interesting film overall, but it was only the performances that kept me from wanting to leave the theatre.I'm a huge fan of Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson. Although Ferguson hasn't really been all that present in the world of motion pictures for as long as Fassbender (at least in the mainstream spotlight), I find her work to be wonderful. Whether it's being a badass heroin in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation or giving a devoted dramatic performance in the lukewarm The Girl on the Train, she has proved herself to have some range. Fassbender is pretty likable in everything he does, so that should come as no surprise, but I'm honestly only gushing over these two performers because the film itself doesn't have much to lend a compliment to. I found myself incredibly bored with its pacing and lack of an inciting incident to really get me invested.In the end, there is a salvage score to keep the film's tone in line, a lot of the cinematography is well-done, and the performances seem to be devoted to their respective roles. That being said, the screenplay, along with the overall editing and final product, just doesn't match up to any of those aspects. The film feels like one long movie trailer for a ten-episode television series. The worst part is that you can see where the film could've been improved upon, which makes rewatching it impossible. There isn't a scenario in which I'll ever find myself recommending this movie to anyone. The Snowman is a neat idea that is stretched into a two-hour film that feels too long, while also feeling incomplete. A disappointing film to say the least.",The Snowman
64,kuarinofu,Mishandled,6,7 January 2019,"First of all, this movie looked and sounded great. Amazing cinematography and good atmospheric score (yet a little loud sometimes, should've been more subtle). The performances were ok for the most part, but it seems like nobody really cared enough to be remembered. I'm not sure though if Fassbender was playing an insomniac or he was just too bored to convey an emotion.
I can't tell for sure, but I think that the adaptation itself is what ruined it for me. I didn't read the book, but at times it feels too obvious that some parts were copied directly. It may be the book's fault, but some of the characters really lacked depth. It is usually easy to distinguish characters in scripts written for the screen and characters transcended from a book (these were pretty much a set of cliches, drunk/depressed cops, revenge fueled motivations etc. This doesn't feel deep enough. You need to have deep characters in a thriller these days.
The pacing/editing was clunky. Introductory scenes were really fast and cut in a somewhat confusing way. It's like if the movie is briefly filling you in on the premise. Since the introductory scenes are a mess it's really hard to establish an attitude towards the killer in the end. Then they throw a lot of characters and subplots at you, some of which disappear and reappear very randomly making you forget they were in the movie. It's not that slow or long, but it sure feels dragged out. I first checked time around 40 min in, and it's not a good thing for me when I do that. The twist was absolutely readable around 50% into the movie. I was nowhere near being even slightly surprised.
The ending, even though looking great, still felt lame. This is a result of a kind of confusing tone of some scenes. Some of them feel like unintentional comedy (or clever intentional one?). Like the mom drowning in a car doing a face you do when you meet the neighbor you don't know to well in an elevator. It also feels like the ending was re-written in a way, since the killer had no reason to move to the lake, he had a gun and if he wanted he could've killed them in the house or drive away. Even if he had other motivation the movie still doesn't tell us what is was.
It also had some weird stuff. Like casting a very odd (and old) looking Val Kilmer and dubbing his voice in a very unnatural way (badly lip-synched too).",The Snowman

It was good to see Val Kilmer, but you could tell he was sick and the voice over for him was odd. There was no real mystery to this and once the killer was revealed I fell asleep.

The editors probably tried their best to turn this into a coherent film, but they definitely did not succeed. This is one of the worst edited movies I've seen.I will say this however, this movie can be really damnfunny. There were so many scenes where I was laughing my ass off.When Harry Hole (yes, that's his name) sees the shape of a snowman drawn on the car roof, the completely random uses of Popcorn Song, when the camera moves around that random snowman to reveal that it's actually a ""scary"" snowman... comedy gold!

70,Alexander_Blanchett,Not read the book - and I think the hatred is overrated,6,24 February 2018,"Its not a great film but its also not as bad as people make it out to be. I think the films biggest problem was the editing. And that is shocking concerning it had such a great editor in Thelma Schoonmaker. The film ended up with a lot of holes and quite confusing. Actingwise it was fine. Michael Fassbender was the right choice for that role and while he was underused he still delivered. Rebecca Ferguson was also not brought to her full capacity but she was okay. Nice to see Charlotte Gainsbourg again. I did not really think it needed actors of the caliber of Val Kilmer or J.K. Simmons for the respective roles as both roles were useless and the characters not really challenging.
What I liked most about the film was the Norway setting which was so beautiful and gave the chance to have a lot of great images. The score was all right and the plot itself fine. I think even the rather weak conclusion would have worked better with a more inspired direction and more not the top editing. The source material at least is quite popular with both critics and readers. Oh well, not a film that needs to be seen but after all the bad word out mouth I really expected something worse.

72,CANpatbuck3664,The Only Thing That's Criminal About The Snowman is the Waste of Talent of Everyone Involved,3,21 October 2017,"The nice things I can say about the Snowman are brief but I feel that its important to mention them. The cinematography is solid, they capture the beauty of Oslo well and it makes for an interesting backdrop for this murder mystery. They take advantage of the environment to create some beautiful moments and I'll give them credit for that. The next thing is that I'm sure this book is interesting because despite The Snowman's every attempt to divert my attention through its lack of storytelling polish, I was interested on where the story was going to end up. Other than that the acting was okay? That's about all I got.I have to believe this was a better book. The story of Harry Hole investigating The Snowman killer has all the classic trappings of a good detective story. The violence is pretty brutal, the characters all have a twisted sense of morality and I didn't find it predictable. The Snowman fails at translating this because they fail to properly connect aspects of the story. We spend a good amount of time with Val Kilmer's character Rafto for a very minor reveal and then he's just gone for the rest of the movie. There are red herrings that occupy big amounts of screen time that are also dropped without a care. Some subplots have no purpose (who cares about his relationship with his stepson? It has nothing to do with anything!) and some just fade out into nothingness. I can't believe someone with Alfredson's ability would just fumble all of these basic things. There are a couple of stories about the troubled production that I'm inclined to believe them after viewing the final product.The Snowman doesn't lack for interesting characters. If Harry Hole was in a more complete picture, he'd be a great protagonist. His relationship with Katrine (as a non-romantic partner) made for a decent pairing. You also have some suitably slimy people operating in town (Arve and Vetlesen) to point the finger at. The raw materials are there but other than Hole and Bratt, none of them are developed. The beginning of movie highlights this, we get some shockingly graphic scenes with a boy and his mother being abused by a guest. Only after that do we meet Harry Hole and then that scene isn't even referenced till 3/4 of the way through the movie. We also get very little dimension about the Snowman killer after he's revealed. The movie just rushes into the finale, why does he leave snowmen outside? Why did he commit these crimes years ago and only recently decide to continue? These questions go unanswered (there are very minor hints dropped but I think we were due a better explanation) and it just added onto the frustrating experience.The largest problem with The Snowman is that baffling editing choices. Not only is this thing hacked up to death, it can't do even the bare minimum to help the story get along. There are scenes where you can't possibly understand the actions of the characters, not because they're poorly written but because of the bizarre scene transitions. People's motivations change on a dime, weapons disappear without an explanation and it was hard not to burst out laughing. I kept throwing up my hands and asking Why? What? How? so many times in this movie. It was honestly ridiculous, I don't want to blame the editor completely as the director admitted 10-15% of the script wasn't even filmed. There is also so much key dialogue said off screen that it makes the movie look sloppy. Would it been hard to throw a little more money into this to create a passable product? I guess that's not up to me but I can't imagine it would have been that difficult.I'm just unloading on this movie but I want to make it clear, I don't blame this misfire on the actors/actresses. I really like a lot of this cast. Fassbender is a great actor that can play in many different genres. He's decent as Harry Hole but he lacks the material to shape Hole into a memorable detective. I also really like Rebecca Ferguson, outside of MI: Rogue Nation, she just has a hard time picking worthwhile projects. She also does good work but her character is just so bland that you can only care about Katrine so much. Poor Val Kilmer, he looked like he was trying but this movie made him look awful. J.K. Simmons is fine but his accent is iffy and you think he's going to play a bigger part but he doesn't. Charlotte Gainsburg drifts in and out of the plot and she's undercut by the treatment of Hole's family issues.In the middle of this movie, I was around a 5 on it. Sure, its remarkable how bad it is considering the talent involved but as I mentioned, the mystery of who the killer was did keep me relatively interested. To my disappointment, the wheels fall off the cart completely at the end. Characters are left hanging without any kind of a resolution, the reveal comes completely out of nowhere and the ending is just thrown together and unsatisfying. The action is poorly filmed and it was hard not to walk out early with the final confrontation being so groan worthy.This is one of those times where the reviews on this are pitch perfect. If you're a fan of this book, I am so sorry. I can't remember another time where there was this much talent both behind and in front of the camera yet the end result is a dull and mishandled mess. I hope that this movie is a distant memory in the careers of the people involved. The only way I'd watch this again is with a case of beer and I were playing a game with some friends where you drink when something is unintentionally bad.",The Snowman
73,Rickting,Oh dear,4,13 October 2017,"What went wrong? That's what I want to know. What happened? This movie had everything going for it. It had an amazing book (I'm a massive Jo Nesbo fan; he must be furious about this movie) as the source material, a talented director and a seriously strong cast. It had all the ingredients to be an awesome Nordic-Noir thriller. How couldn't it be? Now, I'll start by saying that this is a watchable film for the most part. It's got plenty of lovely shots of Norway, one of the most beautiful countries out there in my opinion, and the requisite thrills, shocks and turns throughout most of the film. Don't get me wrong; the characters are cold and it's never scary, but at least it's interesting. All of the mostly English and American actors do fine (Well, mostly anyway) and speak with convincing Scandinavian accents, which was very helpful in getting us to accept that everyone in Norway suddenly speaks English the whole time. Then, then- then- comes, honestly, the worst finale of a film of this kind I've ever seen. No, I'm serious. The villain's reveal makes no sense, his psychology isn't explored, there's no tension, action or anything really resembling a stand-off and then one short scene later the film ends out of nowhere. Seriously, what were they thinking? The book had an awesome finale on the Oslo ski jump for crying out loud! By the looks of it, judging by all the unresolved subplots, terrible editing and complete lack of coherence, the causes of this failure must be either studio interference or 3 different people with different ideas writing the script. Seriously though, what happened? Also, this is the first time I've ever been bored by Michael Fassbender... and Harry Hole is such a great characters in the books! Poor Jo Nesbo. Still, hopefully someone else will do the books justice. Speaking of which... note to the makers of this film: It's Harry Hoo-lee not Harry Hole! 4/10",The Snowman
74,davidgee,Norwegian wooden,5,19 October 2017,"Another movie that didn't make much sense. I haven't read the rave- reviewed Jo Nesbo novel it's based on, but this kind of slightly 'noir' Scandinavian police procedural is usually adapted for television. The ingredients are formulaic: a detective with a drink problem (Michael Fassbender) investigates a serial killer who leaves a trademark/signature (the snowman) at each of his gruesome crime scenes.The psychology of the murderer is too lightly sketched in – abortion and abandonment seem to be part of his motivation – and the story goes off in too many directions with too many characters. The pace is erratic and then there's a rushed denouement which has some ludicrous elements, with a death scene that we've seen before (in OMEN 2 and elsewhere).The Norwegian scenery is very attractive and so is Michael Fassbender, although the script doesn't make many demands of him. Did this start out as a 6-hour series? If that's the case, the condensation has created a huge muddle, and it's still too long at two hours.",The Snowman

Terrible.",The Snowman
76,PyroSikTh,"Val Kilmer...What Happened to you, man?",3,17 October 2017,"I wasn't sure how this film could fail. Tomas Alfredson has delivered some great movies so far, that were both enthralling narratively and as an experience. Michael Fassbender is one of the best actors working today, and The Snowman boasts an impressive supporting cast to ensure he's kept up with at all times, from Rebecca Ferguson to Charlotte Gainsbourg to J.K. Simmons to Val Kilmer, Chloe Sevigny, Toby Jones, James D'Arcy, and David Dencik. Added bonus I noticed as the opening credits began; produced by Scorsese too.Unfortunately all the big names in the world weren't enough. The Snowman starts with intrigue and a fascinating attention to detail that Alfredson has made a habit of, but once the opening credits are over with, it's like they couldn't be bothered any more and haphazardly stuck it together the best and laziest way they could. Entire subplots are introduced that have no bearing on the film at all, and some things just happen without build-up or explanation. The twists and turns of the film's various revelations fall flat and add nothing, and the third act culminates with the epitome of an anti-climax.Harry Hole is a cop in Norway (for some reason) who has a serious drinking problem, is so bored at his mundane job that he doesn't appear for weeks at a time, and tries his best (and fails) to be a surrogate father to his ex-girlfriend's teenage son. Katrine is a new cop transferred over from a neighbouring city who is secretly following her own investigations for personal, vengeful reasons, that just so happen to align with what's starts to happen. That's the extent of the character development, for any characters, in the whole movie. Sure, a movie doesn't need a whole load of character development to work, especially in crime thrillers like this, but this felt extra hollow and soulless.Entire characters are introduced played by big-name actors that have no (or little) relevance to the story. Toby Jones has maybe thirty seconds of screen time in total, J.K. Simmons is a womanising philanthropist who's just there as an unlikely red herring (so unlikely that he's never even floated as being a possibility), James D'Arcy is the husband of the ""first"" victim whom they keep going back to for some reason, and Val Kilmer...Oh my god Val Kilmer is the worst thing about this already not-great movie. His botox has covered any and all expression of emotions, and the delivery of his lines was so unusable that they had to (badly) overdub him. What's worse is that they could've saved us the torture of his presence by cutting his character's subplot entirely, and the movie wouldn't have been affected at all.There's a lot that just sort of happens too, for no reason. For instance the killer replaces some pills in Harry's house that he got rid of. It's not made clear why, but it must be important right? The only importance it has is that his ex comes along, goes to the bathroom and finds the pills, and has a tantrum about them...for some reason. Besides the fact that there are too many variables for this to be a valid form of manipulation on the killer's behalf (the ex would visit Harry, would go to the bathroom, and would find the pills), it's inconsequential as the next time we see Harry and his ex again they're perfectly happy and fine as if nothing happened.The movie has some serious pacing issues too. It starts off slow in a cool way. It builds up tension and mystery and gets you gagging for more. However it soon turns slow in a not-so-cool way. The first act drags on far too long. This is a movie about a killer who leaves snowmen to taunt his victims, but it takes half the runtime of the entire movie before Harry and Katrine even realise there's a killer at all, let alone start chasing him. Once they do find out, you'd expect it to start kicking off and getting somewhere, but instead it pisses about with pointless subplots that have no bearing. It starts to drag so much that I actually found myself bored, which doesn't happen very often. Once we hit the third act, it rushes it's way through the twists and turns to reach a climax that is unsatisfactory and anti-climatic, we get a coda that lasts about two minutes and then credits, making you feel like you wasted your time having bared the long stretches of nothing that happens.The Snowman is up there as possibly the worst movie I've seen this year. It's lazy, boring, inconsequential, forgettable, badly written, badly edited, badly acted, badly paced. Just about the only praise I can muster for it is for Alfredson's signature directing style in the movie's opening, for Fassbender's tortured performance that makes the best of what it's given, and J.K. Simmons brief yet bizarre turn as the oddly awkward womanising philanthropist. I give The Snowman a bad 3/10.",The Snowman

79,MovieCriticOnline,An unmitigated mess,1,31 July 2020,It's like they shot a movie somewhere and after it was done they dump all the footage into a bucket and shook it up and then randomly put it together. That is the only explanation for how this could be so bad.Way too many characters and lack of a coherent storyline didn't help. And what's with the horrible accents? Why did they need them. Some spoke with a British accent others tried with a Norwegian accent.There was just no rhyme of reason to any of it.SKIP!,The Snowman
80,SkullScreamerReturns,Stylish but confusing,5,19 December 2019,"I haven't read the novel on which this film is based on but I'm willing to believe the book is actually very good. Watching the movie I see that there is a very exciting story...somewhere hidden between the images!The problem with this movie is that the scenes are visually very beautifully shot but it all seems too ""artistic"", like watching random scenes that lead to other random scenes. Half of the time I was confused who is that character and what is the relation of this and that character. Then there's some jumping between different times which went over my head. Somebody's depicted alive but the next scene he's been dead for decades, and I didn't even know it was a flashback.The actors are ok but no one's spectacular. I don't know what's the purpose of Val Kilmer's character except to make his name look good on the billing. He doesn't really do anything.So it's a little bit difficult film to follow but I don't think it's entirely bad. I really liked the outdoor landscapes and cool looking directing overall. It's just that the story is so complicated that it should have been explained a little better.If you like Scandinavian tyle thrillers and value visual style and atmosphere I think you might like this one too. But be sure to not to watch it when too sleepy because you need to be awake to try and understand the plot. Maybe better if re-watched but I'm not sure if I'm going to.",The Snowman
81,Rautus,An odd and strange film that leaves you with more questions than answers.,4,6 April 2018,"The Snowman, based on the best seller by Jo Nesbo was certainly lost in translation when adapted to the big screen. It's a missed opportunity, putting it mildly. I heard that the film was a mess and I decided to see it for myself if it really was a mess due to being unfinished, and they were right. It's a real unfinished mess all right. The film suffers from a strong lack of focus, the killer's methods are barely fleshed out. Fassbender plays nothing more than a burned out cop cliche. His partner is just stuck up for most of the film and then has some personal vendetta to avenger her father's death halfway through the film, only to get killed, which is bold but makes her already thin character arc even more superficial. Her death is supposed to be motivational for Fassbender's character but since they have zero chemistry together, it's all unengaging and doesn't amount to anything.The acting is very flat as a whole, no one shows much emotion, they are as cold as the environment they are surrounded in, which seems to be a common style for the director. And when they do emote, like the scene with the dad in the car talking about the girl being his daughter, it's that forced dramatic acting that's used to win Oscars.JK Simmons is such a poor red herring, his character is literally nothing more than that. I figured out the real killer's identity on the train scene where he talks with Fassbender, something about him made me feel that he was the killer, it just felt obvious.The final confrontation with the killer and the ending as a whole was rushed. You get the feeling that they just had to get everything wrapped up as quick as they could. The editing relied too much on choppy cuts. The cinematography was nice, some great shots of the locations. Overall, it really does feel like only 60% of the movie was filmed and edited together to give a very unfulfilling and unsatisfying experience with an odd and strange film that leaves you with more questions than answers.",The Snowman
82,drpainters,Just a terrible mess,4,5 April 2021,"A terrible mess of a movie, I was looking forward to seeing and like Fassbender.

Obviously, this movie has a lot of chunks taken out of it, but on second viewing you can follow the plot.Like everyone else, I really wanted to see this movie based on trailers and if you see the coming attractions you see that parts were cut out.However on second viewing, while the movie wasn't particularly intriguing or exciting or mysterious or any of those things, the plot is fairly coherent.Spoilers below:While there seems to be some extraneous scenes in this movie they actually all fit together.For example Renfo was actually murdered by the killer. The scene with the woman who was a twin was murdered by the killer for her abortion. The sleazebag and the woman he was pimping were murdered by the killer, maybe because he would be able to figure it out.The basic theme was, women who didn't take care of their children needed to die for it.We saw at the beginning of the movie his mother didn't protect him and she allowed him to witness her abuse and to be abused and then she abandoned him through suicide. So basically he grew up warped and he was out for revenge for women who didn't take care of their children in some way or he decided was neglect or poor mothering.The villain is so obvious and the introduction so awkward.

His investigation leads him to ""The Snowman Killer,"" an elusive sociopath who continuously taunts Hole with cat- and-mouse games. As the vicious murders continue, Harry teams up with a brilliant recruit to try and lure the madman out of the shadows before he can strike again.I understand that a 1001 things can go wrong for a film during it's production, to prevent it from perfect. But when you have such a talented cast of actors and a capable director, I don't understand how you can go as wrong as you have. Obviously esteemed actor have failed in the past, as have esteemed directors. But if you mix enough of them into a blender, it will surely create art. Right? Well apparently not, as this film fights to prove.Perhaps the one and only true redeeming quality in this movie is Michael Fassbender. The man is a sensational actor and I can buy him in almost any role he plays. And that is no different here! He succeeds in conveying the dark and troubled nature of his character and at point makes my sympathise for him.As far as minor praise goes, Rebecca Ferguson was at least decent in the movie. The setup was also pretty well done(not like it took 90 minutes or anything though) and the film at least looked very nice. It was a pleasant film to 'look' at. The cinematography and editing were both at least decent but it wasn't THAT great.Now for the issues this movie has. And trust me, there are a LOT of them! Firstly I should comment on the plot and conclusion, without spoilers of course. The 'plot' of this movie consists of 75% setup, 20% Fassbender Family Time(more on that later) and around 5% of the actual freaking serial killer. It is one of the most dull, uninspired and lazy plots I've seen all year. With the exception of Transformers and Flatliners, of course! Then there is that GOD awful conclusion. I don't want to jump to conclusion but it may very well be the most disappointing climax this year has presented. Yep. It was THAT bad. Then there is the fact that there an absurd number of characters, and NONE of them have any payoff whatsoever. What was the point of Val Kilmer{Top Gun}'s character? What was the point of JK Simmons{Spider-Man}'s character? What was the point of REBECCA FERGUSON's character? The answer to all of those questions is the exact same: there wasn't one. The story packs in so many characters and then NONE of them matter. Just Michael Fassbender and the serial killer. No one else in the entire film matters, but you'll be sure they do from the way a lot of them are presented.Another thing that bothered me was how much time they spent trying to get me to care about Fassbender's character and family. It makes what's going to happen far too obvious and just slowed down the movie. I don't care if they went to a dumb concert or whatever, it was boring and dumb and slowed the film down to a screeching halt.The pacing was also a major issue. The entire movie drags for 100 or so minutes and then all of a sudden we're forced into a very dull and stupid action climax where literally no worthwhile reveals are made and nothing of note even happens. I can't say I was let down because there was very was very little excitement and intrigue in me at this point. But if I can guess what's gonna happen in a SERIAL KILLER MYSTERY THRILLER, before the 30 minute mark; something is definitely wrong. Overall, I really didn't like this movie. It's such a dull and boring let down, because I got genuinely excited from the trailers and the talent involved. But as it stands, The Snowman's hopes and dreams of a recommendation are melting on thin ice(badum tish). I'll rate 'The Snowman' 4 'Snowmen' out of 10.",The Snowman

87,fciocca,"Really beautiful images, but flat story",6,13 September 2019,"I was genuinely curious abot this movie. The trailer was intriguing. I did not watch it at the cinema, as I wanted to do originally and in the end I recover it two years later.Let's start from things that I really liked: the cinematography, the framing, raw and snowy landscapes of Norway. The rhytm of the movie is slow, investigation scenes are very well made and music highlight the general mood. Of course I appreciated the cast: Rebecca Ferguson (Life), is very expressive and her perfomance is just amazing. I cannot say the same thing about Michael Fassbender, that despite is... okay in his perfomance, compared to other movies like Prometheus or Alien Covenant, is pretty flat and unmemorable. Anyway he well reppresents this lonely and alcoholic police man, with a difficult life.From a technical perspective, I have nothing to say: just amazing, the cinematography, the framing and different shootings were absolutely fantastic all this combined with an amazing color palette, composed of desaturated and cold colors.So where is the problem in this movie? mainly in the ending. I think that the latest 30 minutes were too rushed and instead to get to the final solution of the case calmly, it seems that suddently the detective discovers the truth. There are some clues that make you understand who is the culprit along the way, but how is unmasked is disappointing. The ending then is inchoerent with the rest of the movie and during the final score, I asked to myself: ""that's it? that's how is really ending?"". Yeah, because for the whole movie we see how skillful and smart Harry Hole is, and the resolution is due to a stroke of luck?That's why I personally think that this had to be a mini serie, maybe composed only by three or five parts maximum, and then develop and ending the story in a proper way. I even bet that if they would have done like this, ratings would have been way, way better.",The Snowman

They are able to take their time, for actual build-ups in their storytelling, with interesting characters, development and original plots and twists.The Snowman seems attractive, because of the source material and a decent cast. Michael Fassbender and Rebecca Ferguson are delightful to watch in a beautiful scenery that makes you hunger for the next shots, hoping that their hunt for a killer leads to something.Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. As individuals, the characters and motivations are interesting, but where it comes together in interactions and story development, they are lost in the mess. The mess doesn't imply that the story is just bad, because it isn't. The problem is that the movie constantly feels as if parts are cut or left out. This makes the story and the characters feel inconsistent, unhinged and incomplete. That feelings stays till the final seconds of the movie, where the big reveal does nothing to the viewer, because their is no commitment, no connection whatsoever.You probably won't care for the good guys, you won't care for the killer, nor will you care for the victims.

It's another Scandinavian murder thriller - to sate the demand the producers hope exists.Starring Michael Fassbender as famous but alcoholic Oslo cop - sorry, elite squad's lead detective - out to catch an elusive serial killer.If you like the ""Millennium"" series, be warned: no strong female characters here. It's all about watching the sweet but curiously expressionless face of Fassender dragging himself through mounds of snow to try and stop the killings.The critics seem to not like the poor ""Snowman"" at all: 8/100 at Rotten Tomatoes, 23/100 at Metacritic. Users are comparably cold: 22/100 and 2.3/10, respectively. Don't worry, the movie's not actually that bad. It's just not a gripping one.The story unfolding on the screen is so pedestrian and lifeless that you have to be a fan of the genre, or Fassbender, to get some joy out of this.The makers can't hold the suspense even though there are always new murders to fall back on. Actors can make the story watchable but the result fails to ignite. I can't even think of anything interesting to say about this.The teenagers in the cinema, or the majority of the audience, seemed to like it though. I heard them discussing the most blood-curdling scenes later. It is true that the movie offers some not-PG-friendly blood and violence.The impressive cast includes Charlotte Gainsbourg, Chloë Sevigny, Rebecca Ferguson, Jonas Karlsson, J.K.

94,bazookamouth-221-898097,"The movie is just really, really bad.",4,11 September 2018,"""The Snowman"" is an awful movie. It somehow has too little going on - gaps in the storytelling that make it incomprehensible - and is weirdly repetitive. It definitely isn't thrilling or scary or whatever else a serial killer mystery thriller is supposed to be. In addition to Fassbender and Ferguson, ""The Snowman"" has an excellent supporting cast. It includes Charlotte Gainsbourg, Toby Jones, J.K. Simmons, Chloë Sevigny, and Val Kilmer. Unfortunately, all of them have bizarre roles in the movie. Gainsbourg is an important character at first, but for some reason begins behaving erratically and irrationally later in the movie. Toby Jones is one of those actors you're pleasantly surprised to see in any movie, but has little to do here. And J.K. Simmons has a bizarre accent for reasons I can't discern. The movie plays him up to be an important character (he's trying to secure Oslo as the city to host the soccer world cup), but by the end of it, it's hard to see why he even needed to be in the picture. The two actors who the movie mistreats the most are Sevigny and Kilmer. Sevigny briefly shows up as a woman who quickly gets murdered, and then she shows up again as the dead woman's twin sister, who says little more than ""I'm her twin sister"" before disappearing from the movie.Kilmer's plot thread is even more confusing. He plays a policeman who was on the killer's tail some years previously, I think? At some point, he comes across a dead body, stares at it for a minute, and fires a gun into the air. In another scene, he's in the police station and gets a note from the killer, then walks over to a window in another room and climbs out through it.

96,Aly200,"Disappointing, Uninteresting and Poor Use of A-list Cast",4,18 January 2018,"Talk about a real bore of a supposed mystery film with a capable cast, bestselling source material (that I have not read) and a director with award nominated features under his belt. Alas this is the fate of Tomas Alfredson's middling adaptation of Jo Nesbo's novel of the same name. The plot features Michael Fassbender as Norwegian detective Harry Hole, an alcoholic yet intelligent investigator, who is called upon to investigate the country's first known serial killer (the titular Snowman) along with a new recruit (Rebecca Ferguson). However the killer proves elusive and taunts Harry, daring him to catch him before the next victim is slaughtered. Sadly the film's leads are woefully boring to watch and the results show on camera throughout the two hour run-time. Fassbender's Harry spends most of the film staring morosely into the distance, mumbling his lines or plodding along as victims are picked off. Even Fassbender's co-star chemistry that is normally well tuned is uninterested especially with actress Rebecca Ferguson as Katrine Bratt; the two actors don't even share eye contact half the time. There are additional forced relationships for Fassbender's Harry such as Charlotte Gainsbourg's Rakel (an unnecessary character till the film's boring climax) and her young son, Oleg (another unneeded character) who like Harry, but are sometimes annoyed by his bad habits. Even actors J.K. Simmons (in a throwaway role for the talented Oscar winner) and Val Kilmer (whose role eventually ties into the mystery, but isn't interesting or even developed) can't elevate the waste of actors whose characters we should care about, but don't.The film's plot is pretty generic as it features a long gestating mystery, a troubled lead and eventually a big reveal that does not excite. The story of such gruesome murders should be a real potboiler that makes you wonder who will be next or who the killer is. However the script does not devote anytime to offering any interesting suspects; a couple characters are suspected till the real culprit is eventually unmasked. Even the killer's motive is bland and uninteresting, making little sense outside of a petty grudge for a tragedy that occurs in the film's opening reel. The natural filming location of Norway does lend a credible brooding atmosphere with its cloudy skies and snowy locales unlike the brooding of its male lead.",The Snowman
97,dakjets,Such a shame....,3,27 February 2018,"I tried to watch this movie without pre-judging it. Considering all the bad reviews the movie has received. But after an exciting and promising start, things begin to go wrong.
Most is probably written here why this movie is so bad. I'm thinking: this project is really a lost opportunity. For the book by Jo Nesbø is really top crime, which had really deserved a better fate than this movie. I recommend everyone to watch the movie Headhunters instead. It has everything that this movie is missing, first and foremost it's exciting.
Did they bet on the wrong director here? Maybe. Everything was right with amazing Michael Fassbender in the lead, but even he does not manage to do any good here. The scripts sucks, and the story has so many loose ends.

98,PetarNeo,"What is there to say, you definitely won't remember this one",4,14 October 2017,"Incredible novel from great Norwegian writer Jo Nesbo has turned it's pages onto screen and once again book to movie adaptation suffers from same problems that always catch movies that try to portray characters and action that happens inside book and minds of readers. Movie follows Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) and Katherine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) as they stumble upon mysterious killer that leaves snowman's while killing his victims. Michael Fassbender gives an interesting insight into Hole's mind and his troubles but it seems as he was given too little to work with and he did a pretty good job in that. Rebecca Ferguson (Katherine Bratt) was also a good part of movie as she tries to move and gives her best in everything but kept Harry at distance most of time. Writers of the movie script took great project but as you hear the lines and dialogues it is obviously that something isn't right. Director Tomas Alfredson (Let the right one in, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) gives his view of Snowman and it was sometimes slick but many many time choppy and just feeling that movie needs to project horror and fear was missing mostly, there are some great scenes and shoots but it seems that he just didn't know how to put it together. For the 119 min movie you will find last 20 minutes most entertaining and filled with everything that movie needed from the beginning because they are horrifying, tense and very greatly put together. There's a lot people that love Jo Nesbo and his work because it's filled with great action, incredible mystery, stunning character evaluation and much more. Harry Hole as detective in all those books deserves the better and proper portrayal because of potential that it could have in movie world given how Snowman changed and messed with Harry which wasn't seen very much in movie.

100,Jared_Andrews,Terribly Dull & Incoherent,1,3 November 2017,"Who would ever name their son Harry Hole? That is one of the many questions that crossed my mind as I watched 'The Snowman,' which I suppose is technically a movie. But it fails miserably to deliver on many of the standard qualifications that 99.9% of all other movies meet.For one, most movies have an A plot and a B plot (sometimes more, but two story lines is a reasonable minimum). The A plot is primary focus, while the B plot offers its own characters and conflicts who in some way tie into the A plot. This is usually the case because it makes sense that if two story lines are going to exist in the same movie they should be at least somewhat related. It makes less sense if the two story lines are completely unrelated.In 'The Snowman,' the two story lines are completely unrelated. Plot A involves the unfortunately named Harry Hole trying to solve a series of grisly murders. Plot B involves a powerful politician and the city of Oslo's bid for the ""Winter Sports Cup."" There's also a drunken detective who is in the movie sometimes. I have absolutely no idea what any of these three stories had to do with one another. This is a problem.One half of the movie does not connect to the other half of the movie. Does Harry know the politician? Is he a big ""Winter Sports Cup"" fan? I have no idea. This would be like if 'Silence of the Lambs' was exactly the same except it added a side story about Chicago's mayoral election. Everyone would think, ""Yeah Hannibal Lecter is terrifying and interesting, but what does he have to do with the new mayor of Chicago?"" They had no consequence on each other.The two side plots of this movie had no consequence on much of anything. Neither really ended in a clear way. They only ended because they were not shown in the movie any longer, as if someone quit halfway through writing them. This is also a problem.For real tho, Harry Hole? The movie makes no acknowledgment of how ridiculous this name is, as if his name is Tom Johnson. When we first saw the name on an envelope addressed to him, I legitimately thought it was a gag, some inside joke from his pen pal or something.The whole movie feels like an inside joke that we're not a part of. The stories don't connect, the cuts between scenes appear random, and the ""surprise reveal"" of the killer surprises no one. 'The Snowman' is a tremendous waste of your time. I suggest you watch something else. Anything else.",The Snowman

The trailer looked excellent and had a very Seven vibe to it. Plus it has a excellent cast and a solid director. What could possibly go wrong? Apparently everything....To start this movie fails on near every level. The plot or lack thereof was an incoherent mess. I felt completely lost most of the time. There is absolutely zero character motivation in this film. On top of that there is a complete lack of suspense or any real element of horror. The movie felt so boring. The plot kept branching off and attempted be smart, but only turned into a mess.Acting wise the movie failed also. For me this is very disappointing considering I'm a big Michael Fassbender fan. This movie was a complete waste of acting talent.Despite the fact the movie took place in Norway, every character also seemed to have a different accent. This may seem small, but this really was quite jarring to watch. Plus since most characters were either caricatures or red herrings I didn't really care about them.On top of all that the CGI looked like something you would see from a student film. The only slightly redeeming quality is that the landscape in Norway was hauntingly beautiful. This is a rare example where even with a solid cast and good director, a movie can bomb.

Along comes headstrong detective Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) who's been transferred in for unknown reasons. Their investigation soon leads them to cross paths with the charismatic Arve Stop (J.K. Simmons), who we learn has a personal connection Bratt. The story is all very basic and never adds anything new or remotely interesting to the detective thriller genre. By the time the killer is revealed I had already given up and didn't care what happened next. The dreadful editing also makes the film overly confusing as to what is happening and how it all connects together. Shots are stringed together for no clear reason and some scenes feel like they were added for no purpose other than to pad the runtime Watching this felt like taking a test that is hard only because the questions are worded horribly. Director Tomas Alfredson has already proved himself with the 2011 spy thriller Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy so it's a huge letdown to see him fail so miserably here. While Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is also poorly edited and unnecessarily confusing, it is at least interesting to watch how the mystery would unfold over time.The cinematography is wildly inconsistent between being actually good and horribly bad. You get to see some beautiful shots of the frozen Norway landscape, but you are also forced to watch some amateur camera work done during important scenes that are key to the overall plot. Dion Beebe should switch to tourist videos since he would be great in that line of work.The only salvageable performance here is Michael Fassbender as he tries really hard to carry the film by himself. However, his character is written so poorly that it doesn't mean anything in the end. Rebecca Ferguson is just alright, but she also suffers from having her character being poorly written. J.K. Simmons is pretty forgettable, but you won't forget the accent he uses. I won't even talk in depth about Val Wilmer and Toby Jones since they are completely wasted in their minuscule roles, each getting three scenes that total about two and a half minutes of screen time.Lifeless and uneventful, The Snowman is a poor attempt to adapt the successful and acclaimed series by Jo Nesbø. Just like the end of a real snowman's life, this film is a wet and sloshy mess that has no redeemable features to warrant its existence.",The Snowman
106,manuelasaez,"Thsi film deserves a loud, resounding MEH",4,19 October 2017,"I was really looking forward to this movie, and who wouldn't? A movie directed by Tomas Alfredson, starring Michael Fassbender & Charlotte Gainsbourg, and executive produced by Martin Scorsese? SIGN ME UP! Man, was I utterly disappointed by how incredibly BORING this film turned out to be. For some reason, I thought that this film was going to be about a serial killer, but instead I got a PSA against Alcoholism. Seriously, it seemed like everyone in this film had a destructive vice, and focused way too much time and energy detailing each one. The ""killer"" doesn't even have much of a presence throughout the movie, an 30 minutes into the movie. It was obvious, and anyone who was paying attention would have seen it coming from a mile away.The film was expertly shot, and the acting was phenomenal. But the script was sub-par and so damn tame. Why make an R-rated movie about serial killers if you aren't going to go all out? You show rare glimpses of understanding why people like genre, but again, the movie ultimately caters to sensitive sensibilities and people who don't want to be bothered too much in watching a movie about someone who kills a bunch of people. I mean, it's okay, as long as you don't really show it, amirite? I am angry I spent $30 to watch this (I went to the iPic theater). I am angry that I didn't read at least a few reviews. I am angry that I wasted an hour and a half of my life sitting through this movie. 25 minutes in and you know if this movie is going to be for you. If you can't stop the movie and pic something else to watch, then you are wasting your time. I wouldn't even recommend it when they are showing it on basic cable. It's just not worth it.",The Snowman
107,asage19,"Excellent film, forget the low ratings",10,4 May 2020,"Beyond me to understand what they're expecting, and why they even watch. This is a beautiful film. I *have* read the Harry Hole novels. I am not outraged that this film is not a faithful adaptation. The cinematography is breathtaking, the acting right across the board is stellar, the plot and the psychology of the characters is so interesting, and presented in such an adult way (that's one of the things that I love about Scandinavian/European/British thrillers). The plot is not difficult to understand. That complaint about plot from some reviewers left me scratching my head, and I *do* occasionally wonder, as I read reviews, if some people don't actually read for pleasure, and therefore don't engage their brains when presented with fiction? Some movies are completely passive experiences, and I do enjoy explosions ;> OTOH, this film draws in the viewer, engages the viewer and makes the viewer part of the experience.",The Snowman
108,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,A major letdown.,3,4 March 2019,"All fans of Nordic Noir around the globe were expecting the release of this film, that was the first American adaptation of a Jo Nesbø's novel. ''The Snowman'' is the seventh installment in the infamous Harry Hole series and also one of the most horror-like books of the Norwegian super-star crime author. I enjoyed reading the book a few years ago, though I don't think that it is one of the best in this legendary series, as it lacked the ingenuity in plotting that is one of Nesbø's trademark characteristics as a crime writer. Nevertheless I was eager to watch the silver-screen adaptation, especially when I heard that Martin Scorsese was ready to participate in the production team.
Unfortunately, the final result was below mediocre and the ending of a film found me feeling sad that so many viewers around the world will form their opinion on both on the book author and the Nordic Noir as a genre, based on this unsuccessful attempt in producing a crime/thriller that echoes the melancholic mood of the novel(s).
The main -but definitely not the only- flaw with ''Snowman'' is its bad editing which makes the viewer feeling confused over a story that seems to be disjointed and not making any sense in some parts. The pacing of the movie is uneven and jumbled, lacking in both fluctuations and climax. The director, Tomas Alfredson is an experienced auteur and the person behind the camera in major commercial and artistic hits such as ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'', and ''Let the Right One In'' seems to be out of his depth in this one, while the actors try to do their best, but without proper guidance make cardboard characters that have little in common with the fleshed-out, compelling characters like Harry Hole or Katrine Bratt.
I can't recommend ''Snowman'' even to the most ardent films of the Nordic Noir genre and those who are fond of Jo Nesbø's Harry Hole universe and characters should better skip this one.",The Snowman
109,comps-784-38265,The Snowman Melts Into A Puddle of Dirty Water,4,15 October 2017,"The 'acid test' of what is, or is not, a 'good film' is (in my opinion) is the question: Would you watch it again? - For 'the snowman' the answer is a resounding NO This is trying to be a clever 'physiological thriller' and fails, and fails badly. It is clumsy, clunky, predictable and disjointed. It is hard to believe this was made by professional film makers. Fassbender and co, are good actors, excluding a barely recognisable Val Kilmer who was cringeworthy as some 'great' alcoholic detective. A predecessor to Harry Holes (Fassbender) Norway definitely has an alcoholic unsupervised irresponsible cop problem. A cast desperately in search of a good script, (or a plausible murder or murderer.) Have a look at the 'trailer' - it shows scenes not even in the actual film !!I can only presume the 'good script' was lost in an avalanche and buried deep in the Norwegian snow never to be found. So the film makers had to cobble together this ragtag montage of plot holes and WTF? moments e.g. Fassbender goes upstairs in a small wooden house, gun drawn looking for the bad guy. Hears phone, sees it's a decoy. Comes down stairs again and baaaam - 2 hostages are now sitting tied to chairs in the kitchen (where fassbender was only 2 minutes previous) with the bad guy with a garrot machine ready. How? What is it Star Trek and they were beamed down? He carried them in one under each arm? Ridiculous as the ice that conveniently cracks at the end and a guy with a gun being chased by an unarmed man. Some nice views of Norway though ! 4/10 seriously don't both",The Snowman

114,joshbarton15,Started so promisingly too,4,15 October 2017,"The snowy white landscapes of Oslo seemed like the perfect setting for chilling crime thriller The Snowman, a film based on Jo Nesbø's novel of the same name. The trailers promised so much and with a lead actor like Michael Fassbender on board, it had the potential to be one of the most intense films of the year. When Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is called to investigate a string of murders where the killer leaves snowmen as a calling card, he must delve into past cases to make a connection before the killer strikes again.For a crime thriller to work, it must grip the audience right through to the end. The first half of The Snowman had my full attention, unsure of where the story was going to go or what would be revealed however, as the film drew on and revelations were made, it utterly lost me due to how lazy it became. They storytelling that felt so strong in the first half was totally absent in the second, none of the revelations as impactful as they should have been and the ending coming so abruptly. I hate the fact the film didn't seem to wrap up this story properly before closing with such a sequel baiting final scene.As with Tomas Alfredson's previous films, the pacing is pretty slow however, unlike Let the Right One In and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, the consistence in quality isn't maintained throughout. Half an hour before the end I was ready for it to finish. Such a shame because this had such potential to be such a creepy thriller, instead the snowmen left as calling cards coming across as more comical than anything.Coming to the performances, The Snowman isn't exactly let down at all. It's just they feel a little uninspired considering some of the actors working in the film. Michael Fassbender is one of the best actors working today but even if he looks as if he's given up on the film towards the end. I'm still waiting for a Fassbender performance as good as Steve Jobs, and that was two years ago now. While I don't think anyone gave a bad performance, the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Val Kilmer, Toby Jones and J. K. Simmons were left a little too underused for my liking.A film of two halves for me, starting so promisingly before fizzling out to such an unsatisfying finale, The Snowman is rather annoyingly one of the biggest disappointments of the year.",The Snowman
115,jburtonprod-802-759029,Not As Bad as Critics Made Out,7,10 February 2018,"This movie is beautifully shot, taking full advantage of Norway's stark, atmospheric bleakness. It's also an above average detective story. So, I really don't get where all the hate is coming from. The writing is a little thin and Val Kilmer's presence in the film was unnecessary, strange and a little sad. The character does nothing to move the narrative forward and is from nine years before the main story takes place. They also badly dubbed a weird voice in for him. I've always liked Val Kilmer and I wish him the best in his battle with cancer but the director should've known enough to cut him out. I'm not a huge Fassender fan but he is good in this. For all it's moving around, going from point A to point B, there is not much detective work here and it seems the end would've arrived whether they were looking for 'The Snowman' or not. Also the they could've done a better job making creepy snowmen. These are pretty tame and not frightening at all. Other than that one, well... you'll see...Even with all that it was an entertaining watch. I had no expectations so there was no reason to feel let down. It's a decent 2 hrs of cinema. I just wish the writing had been better and a few choices were different. If you like atmospheric detective stories it's well worth the watch.",The Snowman
116,InaneSwine,Worst thriller of the year,2,3 December 2017,"The Snowman could honestly be a contender for worst thriller of the year. It's dull, boring, confusingly plotted, drearily acted, lazily edited and poses more questions than it can ever be bothered to answer. Why are all the Norwegians in the film British? Why is it set in Oslo? Why does the killer use snowmen as a calling card? What is the purpose of J.K. Simmons character, other than to effectively walk on screen and pronounce, ""And I'm J.K. Simmons""? Who are these women getting their pictures taken with a camera-phone? And finally, how could a film with such a strong ensemble cast and effective cinematography end up being such an unmitigated disaster? I know not one of the answers and, frankly, the time it took me to watch the film and write this review is about as much attention as I'm prepared to give this shoddy work. The most thrilling moment of the film was the end credits, as I could finally leave the cinema. Avoid like the plague.",The Snowman

118,manchester_england2004,How can a crime thriller be so boring?,2,15 December 2019,"Yesterday, I was reading the novel this film was based on. I am sad to say it, but I found the book very slow and boring. I only managed to get through the first 65 of the 500+ pages. Only one exciting scene was featured - and that scene sadly does not feature in the film.I had bought the film on Blu-Ray a few months before, in the hope that both the book and the film would be enjoyable, and that seeing how closely the film followed the book would be interesting in itself.The idea I had was simple - to read the book first and watch the film afterwards.In the end, I watched the film without finishing the book - because it bored me. And I hoped - desperately hoped - that the film would be better, given that the basic plot outline sounded interesting enough.Sadly, the film is just as boring as the book, if not even worse. And considering that more than 500 pages of text has been condensed into just a two-hour film, it is just incredible that the film is so slow paced. One would expect quite a fast pace, with clutter from the book removed.The plot concerns a cop investigating a series of murders in which the perpetrator leaves a snowman as his calling card. The trail for the killer leads the protagonist to look into past cases.Most of the film revolves around the cop, played by Michael Fassbender and his partner on the case, played by Rebecca Ferguson. In order to make this sort of set-up work, the protagonist needs to be interesting.Sadly what we see too much of in modern crime fiction is a penchant for adding flaws to characters and hoping that these things in themselves will make them interesting, likeable even. Well it doesn't work here. Harry Hole is a completely forgettable bloke and Fassbender plays him with seemingly no interest at all. It's as though he is simply sleepwalking through the part, like others have said or alluded to. He has not got an ounce of charisma and is not in the least bit interesting to watch on the screen.The murder scenes are interesting to watch but the rest of the film is nothing more than a tedious police procedural. Imagine for a moment a very boring Italian giallo from the 1970s, where police officers sit around talking a lot of boring nonsense. Now shift the setting from Italy to Norway and move the action from the 1970s into the mid-2000s. Finally, add in a lot of boring scenes surrounding the protagonist's life outside of work. Got it? Good. That's THE SNOWMAN in a nutshell. And it is tedious to the extreme.Where is the suspense to be found? The murder scenes are well-filmed, but the suspense isn't there.Where is the excitement? The killer taunts the cop with all kinds of text messages, sends him on wild goose chases and so on, and there's not a spark of excitement to be found. It's all done in a ""by the numbers"" way, like a poor episode of a cop show that has been running for many years too long.Why do modern crime thrillers insist on showing us the boring lives the cops lead outside of work? I for one don't want to see any of that, unless some establishing scenes are needed in the event that someone close to the cop is to become a victim of the killer. But these scenes should be brief so that what we see in the film and read in the books is relevant to the plot. Taken together, they shouldn't take up a third or more of the book/film or feel like they are.Much more interesting than watching the cops live their lives outside work is to see the cop at work, wrestling with the dilemma that the case might not be possible to solve, and exploring all the tensions and frustration that would have on the cop and how it all affects the way he interacts with his colleagues and the suspects.The film, like the book, simply features too many characters as well, just about all of whom are forgettable. My personal view is that thrillers work best when no more than six characters are the main focus. This is why I think books like The Girl on the Train work so well - there aren't too many people to keep track of. The only time writers should have lots of main characters is if we are being presented with a group of interesting suspects with some interesting red-herring motives raised and explored. This is not so in THE SNOWMAN.Agatha Christie novels sometimes feature a dozen suspects or so, yet I always remember who's who and remember them long after the story is over. That's because she knew how to create people we find interesting - interesting even when they are totally unlikeable, and whom we might actually despise if they were real people. Where THE SNOWMAN is concerned, I simply couldn't keep up with who was playing what role in the story and what their motives were. It is a mess, plain and simple.The revelation of the killer was only a mild surprise. There were two people I suspected. One was an obvious red herring. The other one was obvious in the ""twist"" sense. By that I mean the person was a likely candidate to be chosen as part of an intended twist.I have to admit I was wrong. I gave the writers more credit and guessed it was the first one. Granted, the revelation of the killer would not have been a surprise, but maybe an unusual motive could have been revealed, making the ending interesting. Instead, the writers decided the second one was the killer, and it was all cliched. I won't reveal the names of the characters in question, suffice to say that many will guess all too easily and be disappointed that a potential clever ending has been replaced with one more obvious, as well as being stupid and boring at the same time.Overall, THE SNOWMAN is a very boring film - simply one of the worst crime thrillers I have ever seen. As a result, I am unlikely to give the book a second read, in order to get through all of it.",The Snowman

120,Eric_Cubed,Far Better Than The Arse-buns critics On Rotten Tomatoes,5,27 July 2018,"The critics gleefully rip this one to shreds. They have many valid points, such as the dragging flow, confusing narrative of it all--a insipid and pervasive banality underlying. But the acting, cinematography, lighting and direction keep this one moving in a lesser impact than Crimson Rivers, but at least at par with Dennis Quaid's ""The Horseman."" This one should probably be a mainstay in film school about a movie that failed though all the right ingredients were present: a popular novel about a serial killer, one of our best actors living, superb supporting cast and a great premise. But the film feels like they shot a bunch of scenes, threw them into a lotto grinder, and hoped for the best. Was the editing the fallure? And if so, who approve the editing failure? Was it a direction failure? If so, which producers signed off on their final product? Really, all they had to do was follow the basic 80's horror films: a traumatized child, a mother complex, followed by compulsive sausage grinding. Why didn't they just follow a few episodes of Blacklist or Hannibal? So Easy. Was the ego of the director allowed so much freedom to mess this one up this bad? Honestly, without any film experience at all, following basic formulas, I'm sure I could have directed this one into a pale version of Silence of the Lambs, leaving all tech to everyone else, and instead using my skills as a psychologist to work with the actors to give their best performance. Let's just see if we can come up with our own story....there is a detective. An alcoholic detective--who strangely experiences missing gaps in time. Suddenly, he begins receiving messages from a serial killer--formerly dubbed as ""The Picasso Killer,"" (because he arranges his victims within grotesque picture frames in surreal fashion). The messages taunt and tease him, sending him vague clues he must decipher in order to stop the next killing. But then a twist occurs. The detective is actually suffering from multiple personality disorder, and it is then revealed he has been writing letters to himself all along. But then there is another twist, a twist within a twist, for we then understand the detective has a paradoxical form of multiple personality disorder in which he believes he and his twin are one person, due of course to childhood abuse. Who is the cop and who is the twin? The twin is a high ranking political candidate, sure of his victory, which is predicated on his twin detective solving his murderous rampage.

124,Field78,"Pretty cool, but should have been an entire season",7,8 November 2017,"There doesn't seem to be a lot of love for The Snowman, which is a pity since most of the elements I love about Scandinavian crime drama are there: an overall unglamourous look; icy landscapes; a protagonist with emotional issues and difficulties connecting with other people; gruesome killings; dark family secrets, enough red herrings to fill a small sea, and a surprise twist at the end. In fact, had this been a Norwegian movie, then I think that most people would have praised it as pleasantly non-Hollywood, but now they don't now what to make of it so they give it a critical drubbing. Director Tomas Alfredson (of Tinker Tailer Sodier Spy fame) knows how to put the elements together in the best tradition of series like The Killing (Forbrydelsen) and The Bridge (Bron) and films like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (Män Som Hatar Kvinnor), but, to be fair, The Snowman is also the lesser of this group.Much of that can be blamed on production issues. Apparently, Alfredson got involved late in the production, and large parts of the screenplay were not even filmed. Judging from scenes that are in the trailer and missing from the movie, editor Thelma Schoonmaaker (of Goodfellas fame) may have had a hard time to make a version that is at least coherent. Still, some sequences in the movie noticeably take their time for set-up, sometimes to little avail, as if essential parts are missing; other scenes, especially the climax and the epilogue, are too fast-paced to the point of feeling rushed. I haven't read the book but I have been told that Harry Hole is much more eccentric and complex than we get to see here. Michael Fassbender is an excellent actor, but I would have loved to see more of his troubles, other than his alcoholism and lack of remembering appointments.The best treatment for The Snowman probably would have been an entire miniseries, preferably with Norwegian actors. It would have given ample exposure to Harry's character, his interactions with suspects, and time to explore the subplots that are now only touched upon, especially the ones involving Val Kilmer, Toby Jones and J.K. Simmons, who get way too little to do. It kind of feels as if the makers tried to cut 10 hours worth of top television into a 2-hr feature. That said, I do not recognize some of the criticism that the film is utterly incomprehensible and its characters all over the place. Undoubtedly, many people are only familiar with heavily Americanized remakes of Scandinavian crime dramas where everything tends to be clear and everyone is rather normal. I would advise those people to watch a genuine one from Scandinavia, with subtitles, made by local actors and crew. Enigmatic, ambiguous characters who cannot be defined by a single character trait, and a measure of ambiguity in the plot should be part of the deal.A final plus is that the makers used their budget for some breathtaking shots of Norway's scenery, something that would have been difficult to realize on a television budget. This movie is certainly not perfect, but it has some great tense moments, and it saves you a ticket for a holiday to Norway.",The Snowman

The story kept me interested all the way through and the Norwegian setting is pretty stunning to look at.
It felt like a TV movie in places though probably because nothing is overly flashy and the movie wasn't particularly action packed but i did enjoy the police procedural elements. It's well acted and i was invested to know what would happen next.
Also you're kept in the dark until the last 15 minutes as to who the killer is and then my reaction was ""Oh, it's that guy....really?"".

A recipe for absolute success, which is the reason why i left the cinema with a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth. Personally, i don't think the movie is as bad as many people are saying, but i believe that you might get a bit more understanding of it, if you have read the book. Which is where the problem lies. You shouldn't have to have read the book, to understand the movie. Thomas Alfredsson manages to create a visually stunning film, packed with disturbing atmosphere and a nastiness to it that really captures the viewer in a downward spiral. Acting performances were passable, although i felt the majority weren't given roles to compliment their abilities. I thought that Michael Fassbender did a decent job as Harry Hole, but that is all that stood out. Unfortunately, the pacing of the film is very disjointed. There are parts missing, which will disorientate the viewer who lacks the knowledge of the missing gaps, filled in by the book. I thought that the movie bit way more off than it could chew, which is the most disappointing aspect of the whole experience. Everything was in place for a great experience, but , although its not terrible, it really failed to deliver on the goods that it promised.

I'll blame the writer and director, because the actors were quite good. The writing and direction was very lazy and formulaic. Here's how:1. It didn't build any suspense nor tension. It seemed like it could've gone in the direction to be more of a horror movie. Instead they went in the direction that seemed 'made for TV.' Just soft and boring.2. It took place in Oslo, Norway. Not a single person in the movie spoke Dutch. Not one Dutch word was used -- In spoken or written word. No one even had an accent. They might as well have filmed in Canada or northern US. Having it take place in Norway lent nothing to the film and didn't make it believable when no one spoke their native language. I kept waiting for someone to explain why this section of Oslo was so full of Americans.3. There were several times I had to scratch my head and wonder what just happened and what it lent to the plot. Several times that went unanswered. 4. Once the killer is revealed, there is no real reason to explain why he killed or what his motive was. You kind of assume, but there is no defining moment or reason. You just have the reveal dropped in your lap with a sub-par build up.With all the big names associated with this film, you kind of wonder how this got made. Pick something else. The acting was good. The cinematography even better. But there was nothing else to watch and you will forget it by the next day.",The Snowman

MF is eye candy for me, his face is both classically goodlooking and slightly asymmetrical also. His hero is a gloomy character but a moody expression suits his looks. The snow scenes, frozen lakes and snowmen have a novelty for the Australian viewer. I can't say much positive about the rest. The fact is I didn't engage much with the story because I was really confused. There were two dark haired women, I get it that one was his ex-partner and one was his workmate but I wasn't clear what was happening to which as they were a bit too alike. There were sequences involving Val Kilmer but his character was apparently dead? There was stuff about children but were we supposed to understand who grew up to be whom and what had actually happened to them? There was a character portrayed by J K Simmons who seemed to be presented as someone of importance but I lost track of any role he might have had in the story. It's a mystery to me!

The last one of his flops is an unfinished, messy and totally flat lined script about a detective trying to catch a serial killer that leaves his future victims a snowman before he mutilates them. Set in picturesque Norway, it shows off some spectacular empty landscapes, reflecting the vast emptiness of the story line, at least a decent plot or some sufficient acting.
Fassbender is looking dazed and confused through the entire course of the movie, like he himself can not beleive what he just filmed, wondering he took the job in the first place.

143,fxdx4,Ice cold trash,2,24 December 2017,"I was looking forward to this movie, as the blend of thriller and horror with an ultra talented Michael Fassbender is right up my ally. With that said, I gave this movie a huge length of rope; found myself trying to see the long boring, usually senseless scenes as mood building. Alas, no.So the plot goes like this. Killer who leaves a snowman as a calling card. Fassbender is a drunk cop who (theoretically) is a genius. It sounds like a good recipe for a movie. There is a bunch of other stuff thrown into the film, but I honestly can't figure out why, or how it relates to the plot. Val Kilmer is in the movie... so is J.K. Simmons... who their characters are, or why is still a mystery to me. OK, so let's give the film credit for it's cinematography. The shots of Norway are stunning. There is some good building of mood, even if it leads to nothing. Fassbender also does the very best with the role he can, but his director lets him down with abysmal pacing, directing choices. Very little about this mess is watchable. It makes no sense. It is agonizingly slow and the 'twists' are so obvious you assume they can't be. It is also disjointed, with little linking one scene to the next. As much as I want to like this movie (and I am going to book my tickets to Norway!), it is a total disaster. Watch the trailer, avoid the film. 2/10",The Snowman

A typical cold grey look that fits the landscape. But the trailer promised a disturbing thriller full of suspense. And man, fell the movie short of that! Other reviewers criticized the loose ends. Yes, it had some. If you spend precious run-time on J.K. Simmons taking pictures of girls, then I expect more pay-off than just a vague hotel room scene and then nothing. Why did they even put his character in the film? And every death scene was barely shown and offered very little suspense. On top of that: - The investigation was uninspired and dull. - The film had no humor. (Doesn't need to, but..) - There was no real character development. (How on earth did they manage to make it two hours long?) - The ending is a huge let-down. As anti-climatic as can be.That's it.

I personally have no love for shock value, and am never frightened by films. If i wanted to be scared, I would go watch Oprah or the Kardashians to be properly terrified at how absurdly stupid and inane the human race has become. Otherwise there isn't much a screen can do to terrify me. This isn't trying. It has the same goals as Wind River, but it fulfills them better. Probably because Detective Harry isn't a blundering idiot. I am unwilling to give up the plot like some others. I can say; nice pace, good story, not particularly original, but very well done.

146,Chiller7,"Not great, but not as bad as to call it incomprehensible",6,22 November 2017,"Okay, this wasn't a great movie. It's kinda bad overall, but not quite as unwatchable or incomprehensible as I've heard others describe it, so let me defend it a little bit. It's a complex plot, but I wouldn't say it's hard to follow. It's a story that's very fond of red herrings, false clues that lead in the wrong direction and ultimately don't connect to the central mystery. Viewers used to narratives that conveniently tie everything together might find this type of storytelling confusing, but it's a valid way of telling a mystery, so I don't fault it for this style of storytelling.And another thing that might confuse more than a few people is the movie's penchant for abruptly jumping into flashbacks with little clue that what we're seeing is in the past. It's not until later on that we realize, oh, so some of these scenes I've been seeing took place a long time ago? It's not a normal style of storytelling, certainly.For a while there, I was into the story. It starts off well, like a solid mystery thriller. Where the movie earns its bad rating is when it falls apart at the end. When we learn the truth behind the mystery, we're left thinking ""What? That's it? Why?"" It's a movie that's on the verge of being decent, if only the ending was better.Also, it's got some pretty big plot holes. I don't know if this is a consequence of carelessness by the filmmakers or what. Like, for instance, one of the murder victims is reported missing, even though the body is in a place so obvious that there's no reason it couldn't have been found before anyone would ever report that person missing. And the killer inexplicably is able to defy logic, by going to certain places and accomplish certain things, when there's no reasonable way he could have done all of it without being seen.But at least I got to take a look at life in a modern Scandinavian country, a part of the world I have limited knowledge of or exposure to. That was interesting. That's really what I was thinking about during the movie, which may be telling of the quality of the plot. Oh, wow, they have modern-looking cities, buildings, & roads. Their standard of living appears to be pretty good. And beautiful mountainous scenery! What was going on in the story again?...",The Snowman

Tomas Alfredson, known for adapting novels on the big screen, took helm of this crime mystery film and literally tried to put it piece by piece in post production.The film is based on a crime novel called ""The Snowman"" and it follows beat-down detective Harry Hole, played by Michael Fassbender in his quest to find a serial killer who uses little snowmen as his or hers calling card.
With that being said, the premise sounds great and after seeing it, I think the execution wasn't half as bad as everyone says it was and the critic reviews were definitely too harsh on the subject.The acting was top notch on everyone's part and even with such a short filming schedule as Tomas Alfredson would later say, the actors were deep into their roles.

Despite a talented cast and some picturesque Norwegian location photography, it's difficult to imagine a more dreary, inaccessible, humorless, or uninvolving movie. Although originally planned to be the first of a series of pictures featuring the character of Harry Hole—there are eight titles to date in Nesbo's series of books—the filmmakers and producers seemed to anticipate the movie's critical and commercial failure. Shortly after the picture's October 13 European release, director Tomas Alfredson candidly blamed the movie's failure on a lack of preparation time and a short production schedule. According to Alfredson, the short production schedule resulted in some 15% of the screenplay not being filmed, causing both inconsistencies and substantial narrative difficulties in the completed picture.And the reviews for ""The Snowman"" have been devastating—the Rotten Tomatoes website reports an approval rating of 9%, based on 116 critical reviews. And the CinemaScore market research film reports an average audience grade of D for ""The Snowman"" from a scale of A+ to F, based on exit polls of audiences who viewed the picture.Distributor Universal Pictures originally estimated an opening weekend gross of some $10 million for the picture from 1813 theaters across the United States.

157,Toph-22,Real disappointment,3,21 March 2021,"'The Snowman'. To break the movie down to its essence, a lot, really a lot of potential was wasted here.I do not even know where best to start.The motive of the murderer and the figure of the snowman is not comprehensible. There is an attempt to introduce the motive and the viewer also thinks, ok, here comes the interesting background. But wrongly thought, the perpetrator and his thoughts are completely interchangeable.This is supposed to be a high-quality, gritty thriller. Why the heck is CGI blood used consistently here? It looks incredibly inauthentic and gives the viewer the feeling of being in a B-movie. The few scenes I'm talking about would have looked so much better with real effects.The movie starts with a good suspense at the beginning and the atmosphere is also oppressive. Unfortunately, this swings relatively quickly in the course of the movie. In the middle part, some parallel storylines are opened, where 1. it's not clear to me what that's supposed to do and what relation it has to the actual plot and 2. these storylines aren't even told to the end.Much of the middle section could have been left out completely and the movie would have been neither worse nor better understood.I can't shake the feeling that the producers were already thinking about a sequel. To be able to build up a film series, everything possible was simply thrown into one pot to have a sufficiently good basis for sequels. This has to go in, this has to go in, oh yeah, and this has to go in too. But please don't go into too much detail, otherwise the movie will take too long.That's a real shame, because as I said, the potential would have been there.

Never has snow looked so beautiful until you see it photographed in Norway.To keep up with the plot you do have to pay attention to all the names of suspects, victims and time lines spoken abruptly in British accents within long contemplative pauses as if every character was avoiding breathing the cold air.Val Kilmer is almost unrecognizable and his voice sounds dubbed which kinda' makes his character oddly more interesting where I wish he was given more screen time.It's a decent, intelligently and beautifully produced movie perfect for curling up with some cocoa in cold winter months to find out who done it.

For the purposes of allowing some development of pace and plot, a couple of the sub-plots could easily have been abandoned and at least given the film a chance. After seeing the film I had to go back to the trailer to find out what it was that could have possibly made me think it was going to be a gripping who dunnit, and I was surprised that the (Australian) trailer contained some snippets that alluded to some more thrilling twists which either didn't make the cut, or possibly I'd lost consciousness at some point and missed them completely. I'm pretty sure it was the former. The dialogue is lame; all the actors (and there are enough great actors here to have made even an average film good, so that goes some way to showing how awful it is) are phoning it in - except for Val Kilmer who is so brutally dubbed over that he goes beyond looking ridiculous; the plot is a hot mess, going nowhere for ages and then landing in weird places (Chloe Sevigny must have had rent due to convince her to get involved with her very brief but very pointless plot line) in order to get a resolution (which is entirely unsatisfying); the scenery is sublime and some of the cinematography is terrific, but none of that can possibly make up for the rest of it. Even the tag line is a cop out. The first snow is well and truly already fallen, and there isn't really much of a hunt for the killer, just a lot of lazy mooching about and some policework that makes Brooklyn Nine Nine look like a documentary. I was honestly pretty mad about this film because it has everything going for it. The excuses that they didn't get to shoot all of the screenplay seem ridiculous. They should have shot less and developed story, and maybe even a character or two, more. Anyone who gives this more than 2 stars is beyond kind.",The Snowman

There's no real plot, you'll figure out who did it about halfway through and just continue watching because you WANT to be convinced that the absolutely awful plot and really bad acting by the ""star"" actors (no, I'm not talking about the leads, I'm talking about Val Kilmer) are really any better than you had hoped in the previous scenes before you guessed, yes, oh, right, that's the killer because, like an Ibsen play, the plot really doesn't matter.This is an exercise in bad acting, by over-the-hill actors who have absolutely no place in a good movie. Val Kilmer is a drunk, Chloe Sevigny, no idea why why agreed to be in this turkey, all the rest, the rent or their mansion mortgage must have been past due.This was just a bad movie. By bad, I don't mean to mislead you, it sucked as big hairy balls as you could possibly imagine. The only thing that COULD have saved this bad movie was the scenery and there just wasn't enough of that. By the end, you don't care who the killer is. You just want to be put out of your misery for having watched for almost two hours. DO NOT waste your money to go see this in the theater, just wait for it on Netflix. They should have just released it there any way. My apologies to the good actors in this movie. You know all the non-American ones. The American ones, I think they put them in here so that American audiences would be fooled to go see it. Ooh, Val Kilmer, Chloe Sevigny. No. Just no. These are bad actors in bad roles that don't even matter to the movie. Just save your money.",The Snowman
167,mattbaxter72,"Mister Police, you are a blithering idiot",1,27 January 2018,"The chances are, you know about this movie by now. The production schedule which meant that about 15% of it wasn't even shot, and the fact that somehow the director didn't notice this until he was in the editing room. The bizarre Val Kilmer cameo, and its terrible dubbing. The fact that Chloe Sevigny plays twins, for literally no reason.None of that can prepare you for the experience of actually watching this thing. It's utterly baffling, to the extent that you have to wonder if everyone involved lost their minds while they were making this film. Characters speak in strange, stilted dialogue, as though English isn't their native language. Accents are parcelled out randomly - Fassbender does an English accent, Adrian Dunbar retains his natural Irish accent, Sevigny and JK Simmons try out something that's probably meant to be Scandinavian, while Kilmer was apparently dubbed by Tom Waits. Plot threads go nowhere, scenes are inserted for no reason, and there's a recurring theme involving the awful song 'Popcorn'. Toby Jones appears for thirty seconds, and is gone again. I spent much of the film sitting there going 'What?' over and over again. At the centre of it all is Michael Fassbender, playing a brilliant alcoholic who's sometimes a detective. Actually, he's only sometimes an alcoholic, too - he has a remarkably ripped physique for someone who routinely wakes up on park benches. His topless shot is a five-second scene in which he stands at a window and looks a bit moody. He has several scenes like this, although in most of them he's wearing more clothes. At one point he wanders into a house and starts making donkey noises at a small child. Incredibly, that's only about the fifth most embarrassing moment in the movie. When the case is finally solved, the great detective Harry Hole (yes, really) solves it more by chance than anything else.For all that, you have to see this movie. Here is a major movie, with big stars that was released unfinished into cinemas. You have literally never seen anything like this.",The Snowman
168,temrok9,A noir masterpiece,10,15 October 2017,"Obviously we have seen different movies. Alfredson's The snowman is an excellent piece of modern cinema, built not on the conventions of a thriller, like Nesbo's book(although of course it works as a thriller), but on the tensions between the unfolding images, the mesmerizing effect of a hypnotic pace that encloses us in a dark and cold vision, the glorious revelations of landscapes(city landscapes, physical landscapes and human ones)that reveal themselves at certain points filling our regard with a sense of beauty. As the film went on, I felt immersed in its charm, building to an ending that creates not so much the tension one hopes to meet in a thriller, but a dark feeling, first as the killer sinks helplessly in the icy water(in a glimpse,as the film's narrative economy is extraordinary all the way through, in contrast with some other film that met glorious critical applause these days but needed 2.45 minutes of boring storytelling to make everything explicit), and second in the short epilogue, which is filmed in a way that creates a very strong impression, stressed by the music,leaving me shocked and thoughtful on the way out. I'll take it! .The snowman is an absolute masterpiece that deserves to be rediscovered in the far future, like many movies of the past have at some point been.",The Snowman

Very slow-paced, and arguably not enough of a pay-off, but it's solid enough to watch start-to-finish.***SPOILERS***The good part is that the film leads viewers down a long false trail. That had me wondering early on: there are no alternative suspects to the string of murders. It seemed too simple. A-ha, there came a twist.The bad part was that the twist didn't make a whole lot of sense. Perhaps because the killer is kept hidden so long, their motivation leaves too many question marks. The climactic scene leans heavily on exposition and flashback; sure signs that the story's presentation was weak.Also, there were so many separate murders that it makes you wonder how the heck this killer got around so much, and why?Still. 5.1 seems low.***MILDLY RECOMMENDED***",The Snowman
170,jb0579,"Either read the book or watch the movie, but not both",3,2 February 2021,"If you read the book - which is utter genius - you'll not like this movie, which smacks of opportunity lost. Characters in the film are homogenized or undeveloped, subplots crucial to the story as a whole are simply omitted, leaving the part of the audience who DID read the book disappointed and sorry for the rest of the viewers who did not read the book. This is akin to The Silence of the Lambs, for example, had they skipped the part of that film where Clarice meets with Dr. Lector in the dungenous prison. Unfulfilled. Its a pity, too; Fassbender is his usual brilliant, and the rest of the cast file neatly in with him. The director did a nice job of telling a story using the portion of the material that was used, but that's the thing - so much was just skipped omitted and tossed aside. And that material being ignored was not a favor to the production. Having said all that, let's take a look at what we have left. It works, but we have an unexplainable feeling of a plot unfolding with missing elements. There are some really well planned foreshadowing teases that if we catch are remarkably clever, and the Snowman motif that obviously was given to us serves to more or less camouflage the less obvious ones. And somehow even with all that's sadly missing, the director is still able to hook around to the final 15-20 minutes for a pretty decent ending with a twist or two we didn't expect. Harry Hole is a tortured soul who is on the trail of a killer who enjoys tormenting those who are on his tail. Give it a go - it's worth a try anyway.",The Snowman
171,michaelmouse1,"Moody, tense,engaging Thriller- not for Morons",9,29 July 2018,"Reading the various negative reviews of this film here indicates just how dumbed down audiences (particularly American audiences) have become by the garbage that Hollywood has been spewing out for decades. Here we have a film that succeeds on every level as a Thriller. It has a dark and disturbing atmosphere, sets its premise out quickly and subtly, then goes about its business without any of the formulaic story by numbers or fanfare that the major studios feel compelled to feed their clueless audiences. If you can't sit with this gently told story for two hours without relishing the expert editing, photography and direction that spins a tale of horror and suspense as good as you would find in any great Thriller of note then you deserve what you get...rubbish like the Independence Day series or Halloween. This is a movie for those who love a dark Thriller, loaded with atmosphere whose journey is much more important than the destination - as shocking at that might be in this case. There are elements here of the Girl in the Hornet's Nest trilogy, Seven,and other films that grab you by the throat and don't let go even as the end-titles are running. If you want simple, idiotic horror films where you know from the opening scene where things will end, this film is not for you. If you relish a couple of hours of slowly building tension that has a degree of challenge about it, then you should enjoy this little gem. Reading some of the truly bizarre reviews here saying people found it incomprehensible or hard to follow leads me to comment that they should stick to what they know...which clearly isn't much. There's nothing overly complicated about the plot...you just need to pay attention and enjoy the ride.

173,rolandjordaan2,The Snowman: Spoiler Free Review,2,14 September 2018,"It takes a special kind of movie to push great actors like Michael Fassbender into caring as little as he obviously cared about this movie. I'm not even going to try and explain what it was about, because I'm not certain that even the writers were exactly sure. The director himself admitted that they ran out of budget and the film was therefore never completely finished: and it shows. Key characters disappear without a trace, Michael Fassbender is constantly being seemingly teleported from one place to another...and the camera just constantly cuts to shots of snowmen for no reason, almost as if just trying to remind us that they are still there. Probably one of the worst and just dullest movies I've seen all year, rather go do push-ups or something, it'll be less tiring than trying to sit through this",The Snowman

I won't bore you with the plot details as you can read them for yourself.
The performances, pace and style is what sets this movie apart from other normal Hollywood thrillers.

175,GoldenBlunderbuss,"An abominable waste of potential, earning its frosty reception",3,31 July 2018,"While investigating a missing persons case, an Oslo detective comes to the realisation that he's hunting a prolific serial killer who leaves snowmen near his victims.
 
Based on the novel by Norwegian writer Jo Nesbo, Michael Fassbender does an admirable job working with either an awful script or a butchered final product (it's honestly hard to tell). It's not interesting and it's not engaging ... in fact, it's boring and confusing. The story jumps back and forth in time with no real indication that you, the audience, have done so and there are only a few moments worth the price of admission, including a victim's head discovered atop a snowman and Val Kilmer uncovering a body by firing his gun to scare away the gulls (as seen in the trailer).If you did happen to see the trailer and deciding the film looked half decent, you'll remember dramatic shots of Fassbender running around outside a burning house ... but ... there is no burning house in the film (apparently it was cut after initial test screenings). That disappointment summed up the entire film - it just seems to have been hacked apart and put back together but with significant chunks missing. There's a subplot regarding a corrupt Winter Olympic bid run by J. K. Simmons which just stops unresolved once the result is announced, there's a woman who's nude photo is taken and kept for no discernible purpose, and the final encounter with the killer is an anti-climactic deus ex machina and a slap in the face to an invested audience.It seems like no one likes this film. It currently has 5/10 on IMDB and a whopping 8% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is perhaps a little harsh since that's the same score given to The Emoji Movie. You might think it's lazy to recite statistics rather than continue to review the film, but I refuse to put in more effort than the production team did.

176,Steve-Zoicks,"Feel the movie, not expect what you would like",7,20 December 2017,"Most the times when people watch a movie they often have their own internal expectations of what they feel they are meant to experience with the adventure or what they meant to take from it. Having watched the snowman with Michael Fassbender I would agree with some of the reviews in saying that the movie was slow in following the sequence of events. But we need to take a step back and see what The snowman is meant to portray. Of course movies are meant to be imaginative and take us each on a journey and movies are interpretative stories from which we as viewers find our own personal connections. So let's take a real look at The Snowman. Yes it's slow and the jigsaw of occurrences are hard to piece together. And isn't that true for what a snowman is in itself. Take a long look at the original 1980's cartoon Frosty the Snowman and you will find the making of a snowman is a long hardous task that is uneven, challenging and slow. Then look at the similarities of every snowman built and you will find that the not one is ever the same. Using snow as a metaphor to hide the criminal in this movie, is in itself a great disguise of the truth. For a snowman is and isn't real. A snowman is cold but only comes and goes as the seasons past and each take of its creation leads to a growing snowball of mass proportions. With the dilemma being the truth of loving a step-son and why or why not should a child be brought up by their non-biological parent is a parody that we all face today. Our world is changing and more and more families are melting in the hot sun of societal demands placed on families. Our beliefs of family values are soaked in the desperation of alcohol to numb our pain and our constant answers of why are lost in our selfless battle of right and wrong. That is what the Snowman is about and so the slow moving pace places you in an awkward momentary process that challenges you to think of your own values and beliefs and holds you not to the action - for life is not full of action - but to the confused and difficult emotive a of the interrelated relationship of Mom, Dad, child and social etiquette that we all are part of and more interestingly we all take for granted in the Snowball rolling down the hill effect.",The Snowman

Sigh. Where to begin? The filming/directing style is gloomy and terrible. I don't mean metaphorically, I mean literally. This movie is shot in scenes too dark 80% of the time, it makes it hard to comprehend what is going on. The plot was minimized because movie, and I feel like they edited out many important scenes that would have helped us as viewers understand the story better and would have answered many questions. This movie leaves out a lot, there are many unanswered questions that they never bother trying to explain. The acting in one word is boring, the lead actor spends most of the movie looking hazy and uninterested. The other characters are just as equally boring and tedious to watch. Maybe, had they replaced the main actor with someone a bit more enthusiastic at their job it would have helped a bit. Overall, this project fails. If you're going to adopt a novel into a movie then you should either do it right, or not at all. It is silly to assume that all of your movie viewers have read the novel, so when you eliminate important stuff out you're asking for a bad public reception.

185,ChipperX,A Chillingly Complex Thriller.,10,5 March 2018,"The Snowman (2017).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq. Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is a renowned police detective in the town of Oslo, Norway. His prowess is the subject of study in classrooms, and his solved cases regularly make newspaper headlines. But when Harry isn't working an important murder case, he gets distracted by alcohol and becomes a falling-down drunk, sleeping on sidewalks, park benches, or wherever else his inebriated feet happen to take him. When Harry's fame grabs the attention of an obsessed psychopath, the detective is locked in mortal combat with a twisted genius that may even surpass his own. Directed by Tomas Alfredson (Let The Right One In & Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy), co-written by Peter Straughan, Soren Sveistrup & Hossein Amini (screenplay) and based upon the novel by Jo Nesbo, Snowman is a virtual smorgasbord of suspense, intrigue, cinematography and atmosphere. Fassbender brings his A-game to the character of Harry Hole, and is masterfully supported by Rebecca Ferguson as Katrine Bratt, who does an equal part of the heavy lifting. Most of the filming is completed in Norway, which adds a surreal depth to the film that might not have been achieved at another location. Unfortunately, all of the spoken dialog is in American English with no Norwegian subtitles, and all references to the Norwegian language, down to the writing on police vehicles, has been removed. Also, it is rumored that production was rushed, which resulted in some scenes found in the book not being filmed at all, and some filmed scenes which were added to trailers were not included in the finished product. Additionally, this film suffers from a lethargic second act, which is sure to cause the movie to drag for less attentive viewers. The great thing about Snowman is the fact that despite its less-than-perfect end result, it is more than the sum of its parts - this movie is far and away one of the best thrillers of 2017. The appreciative and patient film lover will be rewarded with a remarkable amount of violence, gore and an extremely well-crafted villain - in fact, you may never guess the antagonist's identity until Snowman's final act.

189,austinfromdahood,Tomas Alfredson took a fat L with this one,1,5 November 2018,"One of my most anticipated movies of all time no joke, is this movie I'm reviewing, The Snowman. I was pumped out of my mind to see this movie. The trailer looked intriguing, the concept, I thought was really unique, and it looked like a movie I would enjoy. Little did 13 year old Austin know, this movie was terrible. Watching it was a waste of time. This is around the time where I just found my interest in film, and this movie really disappointed a new coming film lover. This movie is probably one of the most disappointing movies I have ever seen. I paid my own hard earned money to see this movie, and it was such a waste of $10. I watched it a second time last week to get prepared for this review, and I still think this movie is terrible. The first 30 minutes of this movie was not that bad, it actually intrigued and interested me. But the rest of the movie was terrible and the first 30 minutes don't make up for it. I can compliment this movie on only 2 things, (but it won't change my score for this movie) the acting and cinematography. The acting is actually kind of good, especially from Michael Fassbender. The cinematography is beautiful, I feel like I'm in the snowy landscape of Norway (the place where the movie is set). And other than those aspects, I thought the movie was terrible. My biggest issue with this movie is how confusing it is. A lot of the events that happen don't add up and the conclusion feels out of place because everything before it felt out of place. For the majority of the movie, we are scratching our heads because we don't know what is going on. I've read from some articles that about 10 to 20 percent of the movie didn't get a chance to get film because of schedule problems. Maybe that 20 percent of movie could've fixed the final film's confusion. The main characters in this movie are bland as mayonaise. They are not interesting at all and we have to go along with them and witness them solve this mystery. At the end of the movie, we're not cheering for them because they are not likeable at all because they are boring. Another thing that frustrated me is the choice of cutting to another event when something remotely interesting happened. It really bothered me and that really ticked me off. There is an ""action"" scene at the end of the movie that didn't really make sense at all because the way it is shown on the screen is so rancid, it confused the poop out of me. And the main character's finger gets cut off in that scene, and it doesn't make sense on how it happened. Just watch that scene on youtube, it'll remind you of an Olivier Megaton movie. The ending scene of the movie also tries to set up a sequel, and in my mind, I was like, ""the sequel's not gonna happen"".

The director treated the last show down scene poorly. There's no strong motive for Mathias to become a serial killer. Katrine Bratt was a bad detective, putting herself in danger time and time again.
Somehow an alcoholic and just switch it off just like that? There must be miracle. While the movie building toward the climax, we learnt that killer's weapon is just a medical/ industrial wire fastener. While our brave hero Harry Hole moves towards the vicious villain, he had every chance to put one in his head, but good old Harry doesn't use his sidearm, instead, he obeys villain's command, sits down, gives up his superior weapon. Harry must not be a good calculator, who can't calculate risk, putting all in jeopardy.

192,CriticalRaccoon,"A Confusing, Horribly Edited Waste Of Talent",3,10 February 2020,"I have rarely ever been baffled by a movie. The Snowman baffled me.Oh, I'm not saying that the mystery in The Snowman was so elaborately crafted that it kept my guessing the entire time. The Snowman is a borderline incomprehensible mess of a film that one must see to even understand that it was allowed to exist. Wikipedia describes it as a ""psychological crime horror thriller"" which ... um ... there's a killer and some gore, but it is not thrilling or psychological in any way.The Snowman is director Tomas Alfredson's (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Let The Right One In) adaptation of the seventh novel in the detective Harry Hole series by Jo Nesbo. Now, I have no idea why they chose to adapt the seventh book specifically, I just assume it's because it had a marketable (if highly comical) gimmick and that it had been a while since the post-Se7en serial killer fad died down. Plus maybe they wanted to make a Norweigian Dirty Harry-esque series with Michael Fassbender, fresh off an Oscar nomination, to be the face of a revival of a long-dormant genre.Brilliant, alcoholic and horribly depressed Norwegian detective Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) is dealing with the break-up between him and his girlfriend Rakel (Charlotte Gainsburg) and their teenage son Oleg (who for some reason doesn't know Harry is his father?) as Rakel has moved on to a new husband. Harry gets a mysterious letter that has a crudely drawn snowman on it just as a woman goes missing. A new police officer named Katrine (Rebecca Ferguson) tags along as the number of missing persons rise, and a link to a decade-old case in another town come up involving another legendary alcoholic cop Gert Rafto (Val Kilmer). Of course all is not as it seems, as Katrine is also tailing businessman Arve Stop (JK Simmons) for some secret reason. Is this all connected? What is the significance of the snowman? Why do these scenes barely connect? Is this even the plot?With that out of the way, The Snowman is a mesmerizing mess of editing. In fact it might be one of the worst edited movies I've ever seen. Even if the director didn't announce that a chunk of the script was unfilmed you can easily tell by the way this Frankenstein's monster is stitched together. Scenes just happen with zero establishing. Subplots are added out of nowhere just to be dropped and forgotten - I'm looking at you, mold. The editing is so chaotic that at some points it looks like Michael Fassbender can teleport. Characters are set up and just vanish with no explanation. All the few scenes with Val Kilmer are just randomly spliced into the movie at unconnected moments and could easily have been cut out. The film has a cold opening scene that feels like it was pieced together with several different scripted versions of it. I could go on for days on how random this film can be but I'll leave it at that.In one of the weirdest things I'll ever say (thanks The Snowman!): while I know what happened in the movie, I'm not sure what the plot really was. I did my best to cobble together what was going on, but between the editing and missing scenes at times I needed to jump to a synopsis to understand what I was seeing. The basic detective plot would be enough for the movie, akin to David Fincher's Se7en, but with the half-dozen subplots being spliced in at seemingly random times with little-to-no relation to the investigation it's beyond lunacy. The Val Kilmer scenes in particular could and should have been cut because they do nothing but make the film more confusing. The revelation of the killer is almost an afterthought and comes across as the film picking a name out of a hat. It's hard enough to figure what is going on in a scene due to the editing, but juggling so much story makes The Snowman incomprehensible at times.I'm not sure what the heck was going on with the direction of Tomas Alfredson and the team that made The Snowman, but there's something just off with the execution. An all-star cast was assembled but all other choices are wrong. The performances of all our leads are in that ""just read the lines as written"" style with no one really trying to emote - more akin to a 1980s Italian horror film than a major Hollywood production. Accents are all over the place - JK Simmons in particular is sporting a ""British"" accent more at home in a Saturday Night Live sketch. There's a child actor that I'm convinced wasn't aware their character was supposed to be grieving for their dead mother. It's just inexplicable.It's hard to even recommend The Snowman ironically; there's no joy here, only bewilderment. Moments of filmmaking madness are sprinkled throughout; it's a film that should not have been released as is. You don't even get Fassbender acting with any of the raw intensity; he seems annoyed that he's stuck playing a nothing character. The only reason I was able to get through this is because I was fascinated by what painful decision the production would make next. There might be a good film buried underneath layers upon layers of bad choices. It almost comes across as an act of self-sabotage when you get those small glimpses of competence immediately followed by a terrible edit or soundtrack choice (the killer's signature song is Popcorn by Hot Butter, seriously). In some ways this movie should be studied as a master class on how to waste talent.The Snowman made me sad. I love Michael Fassbender. I love JK Simmons. I love Rebecca Ferguson. I loved Se7en, Saw and a lot of the films that ripped them off. I enjoy the serial killer sub-genre. The Snowman should have been a new film to call my own.The Snowman should be far better than it is. Superb casting could not save a movie where I legitimately wonder if it was cursed by a witch. Whatever could have gone wrong, did go wrong. A thriller without thrills, a horror without scares, The Snowman left me wishing I was anywhere else. The Snowman is incoherent, badly edited, blandly acted, and a chore to sit through. There are times I thought a good movie was trying to peak through this blizzard of badness, but it just couldn't find its way out. I'm certain that someone with a clear vision could make a good movie or miniseries based on the Nesbo series of books, but The Snowman is as big of a misfire as I've ever seen.",The Snowman

The mood does lighten slightly but it remains gloomy and gruesome for the rest of the 1 hour and 57 minutes of the movie. I loved the mystery and suspense as I evolved my theories as to who the serial killer was as we were introduced to the new victims and learnt what they had in common.

198,bxhancock,Great Potenial That Never Delivers.,5,23 February 2018,"I'm trying to really be objective with this movie. I'm a fan of northern European movies and shows. I watch ""Hinterland"", which is what I thought the flavor of this show would follow. It did not.First off, I hate that Val Kilmer has suffered from cancer but the terrible dubbing of his voice set the movie off on the wrong foot. Thankfully his part was mostly unspoken because every time that dubbing took over, it grated against my brain stem like a horny dog dry humping a fence post. Still, I hoped it would overcome that failing. It did not. It just got worse.The mood of the northern European style was still in the movie and I continued to hope for the best. Then JK Simmons, with his Kevin Costner-esque Robin Hood accent, failed terribly. It started to seem like a joke after that. Then the topless shot of the woman at the party brought nothing interesting to the table. It seemed to start to be disjointed at that point. At this point I was going to finish the movie no matter what. Mainly because I like Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson and Jonas Karlsson and was hoping that they were offer some redeeming quality to the movie. They did not.While their performances were not terrible, the direction was terrible, the story continued to be disjointed and even the decent performances by some of the cast were not able to save it. It would have taken a miracle to bring this picture together. This is what happens when a director does not follow a clear and logical path to the conclusion. Tomas Alfredson loses focus and what should have been a stellar movie, falls well short of its potential. Much like Michael Mann did with Heat, which was a remake of his failed ""L.A. Takedown"", I hope that they remake this movie in the next couple of years. Michael Mann took a great story line, his own failed movie and then remade it better than it probably would have been to begin with. I hope they do that with this movie, perhaps bringing in Ed Thomas or Gareth Bryn to direct the next one.",The Snowman

No one is likeable and half the characters are pretty much irrelevant. The plot bumbles along like a drunk walking home from the pub.

202,Chancery_Stone,Flawed but strangely compelling,7,15 January 2019,"There are things seriously wrong with this film; actions that appear not to be related to anything that's gone before, for starters, but it's an oddly riveting watch. Visually it is quite beautiful and although Scandinavian settings are hardly unusual any more, this one reveals the landscape, and more importantly perhaps, the weather in ways you've never really seen before. It's very nearly a character all by itself. It certainly influences the people in the movie.It is acted like a foreign film, so much so that although everyone is talking English it keeps giving a feeling of being dubbed, which is quite surreal. So pervasive is this sensation that it feels like the actors are all foreign language actors who have been coached in their English lines, which, obviously they aren't and haven't, so the effect is assumably intentional.The whole film has this odd other-worldly feel, with every character strangely detached from every other character - even the married ones don't seem to be able to communicate the most basic details of their calendars and activities, never mind their feelings.The film is flawed, without a doubt, at times being difficult to follow, or surprising you with what feels like non sequiturs, but it somehow works. It feels real in a strange way, with possibly the one exception of Val Kilmer, who feels terribly out of place, unless you forget he is Val Kilmer, in which case he passes as yet another weird, disassociated character in a film full of them.If you can forget the connotations of words like crime & thriller in Hollywood movies then you will have the opportunity to find yourself enjoying something that will stick in your mind long after far better crafted films have been forgotten. It also has one of the oddest and most riveting opening sequences in film history. A true curio of a movie that I, for one, would recommend for the sheer perversity of its uniquely skewed vision .",The Snowman

205,imdb-936-837144,A snowman in every crime scene.,8,23 October 2017,"The opening snow scene depicts an isolated hut where a kid's ""Uncle Jarnis"" drops in unexpectedly to grill his kid on Norwegian history. When the boy doesn't know the answer, the ""uncle"" takes it out on the mom, i.e. the uncle's mistress. When the couple repair to a private room, the kid builds a snow­man out­side. It's fitting as in the quiz the Norwegian head of state resumed his position on June 7, 1945, and a snow­man gets its head put on it, too. Amidst some grinding gears the visit ends in separation. The movie picks up years later when some­body has been dismembering women, mothers whose care for their young left some­thing to be desired.The Oslo police have assigned a couple incompetents (""the drunk and the half­wit"") to one case. A raw recruit Katherine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) investigates another one in Bergen. The official indifference is a seeming indictment against loser moms. In a way it reminds me of an anecdotal story of the Crusades: Opposing armies were set in array when a Muslim rider showed himself trailing a pennant reading ""Ave Maria"" and dipped in blood. A Christian knight courteously asked the queen for permission to fight him in order to defend the Virgin Mother's honor. Permission was granted, and they had a vigorous fight resulting in them being de-horsed, grappling on the ground, the Christian ending up pinned by the Mohammedan who is just about to administer the coup de grace when suddenly he rolls over dead. The Christian had shortened his sword now using it to stab his opponent in the heart. It was taken as a miracle.Professionally burned out Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) on a leave of absence asks the new recruit to look into her case. He's got enough cachet to be accepted. He makes progress, but he's out­matched by his opponent both in smarts and equipment. Just as chivalry prevented the armies from interfering with the contest of champions above, there doesn't seem to be any cavalry to come to the rescue. But he's fighting for sacred mother­hood, so who knows what will happen?There is a concurrent story running about Norway's quest for the World Cup, which seems some­how tied into ""values that make Norway great."" Norway is competing with many other countries. If it's child rearing values, the Jews (whom Hitler slaughtered) held of their law that, (Deut. 6:6-7) ""thou shalt teach these words diligently unto thy children, and talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou riseth up."" The ""uncle "" in a way was attempting this when the film opens.This command would be modernized by Christianized nations, as per, say, the historical fiction of Rev. William Ware (1797–1852) in his *Julian*: Jesus, ""preaching the truths which he conceives to be most essential, and in which the differences are to be discerned between what he holds to be best, and the ancient Law of Moses.  he seems to be rather a restorer of the Law to its true significance, and a rebuker of prevailing corruptions and abuses of it, than one who would over­throw and destroy it."" Or in this case (Eph. 6:4), ""And ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."" I've just supplied my own take on the best child-rearing practice that would take the cake on the values scale; the movie doesn't tell us. It just suggests that it must be some­thing better than what was portrayed in the first scene. The viewer is free to supply his own nominee. The movie does, how­ever, suggest that the mothers did have viable matronly instincts but were rail­roaded by their men into impossible situations with their children. But then again, the women made poor decisions on which men to mate with in the first place. And Norwegian culture does seem to be depicted as too permissive to embody the best family values.The scenery in ""Snowman"" is ultra-simple. The snowmen are basic, and so are the notes. The snow scenes are typically white all over. The back­ground colors are basic solids, lots of prime colors. The music is a succession of single tones, no chords or harmonics. The detectives if they muse on their cases, keep it pretty much to them­selves. If this is a psychological thriller—and it is—then it's basic psychology. Anybody can see it. The effect is a stark depiction of the bleak life of the orphan or neglected child. I mean, the movie never becomes maudlin, nor does it preach, but it leaves one in total sympathy with the children, and even some­what sympathetic to the neglectful moms.""The Snowman"" was directed by Tomas Alfred. It is too sedate and unpretentious to compete with American detective thrillers for the action-addicted aficionado, but it will surely appeal to the European taste in more mellow fare, and for those who enjoy foreign films. European actors tend to be trained and experienced. Those here were spot-on in their roles and not at all ostentatious. The (important) conversation is all in English, so there's no translation distraction. It's a well done film, but one must have a taste for this kind of detective film to appreciate it.",The Snowman
206,FilmsFillMyHoles,"Wow, this was quite the stinker!",3,12 October 2017,"I just don't know where to begin... ...well lets start with the story, a films core. The Snowman's plot and its execution was all over the place. It's not just that it was nonsensical and just laughably stupid by the end, but the movie was filled with scenes and complete subplots that were completely inconsequential and unnecessary. Some characters and their whole storyline could easily have been cut out and it wouldn't have had any effect on the plot. Excuse me, did I write characters? There were none in this film, only famous and recognizable faces who were hired because of their name. Talking about this stellar cast full of fantastic actors, they just as easily could have been replaced by complete unknowns and it wouldn't have changed a thing. I feel bad for them, since Fassbender is in my opinion one of the best working actors today, along with Charlotte Gainsbourg, J.K. Simmons and Toby Jones who unfortunately just did not have anything to work with from the get go.Okay, lets talk about the execution of this mess. It starts out slow after a very odd opening and stays that way for more than half of the movie. Nothing important happens. Then we are introduced to some new ""characters"" and subplots, which also didn't add anything to the film. Then there's some effort to build Fassbender's ""character"", which had no payoff and was completely unconvincing anyway. Then by the time you get to the half-way point you're bored out of your mind and already know who done did the things that had been done, so there's no reveal or twist by the end. And that ending. It is just completely ridiculous and has a few unintentionally laugh out loud moments. So, there's that.I have to say that I haven't read the source material, so I don't know if it's as bad as the film (probably not), but the film is just bad. Really bad. It's extremely stale and bafflingly stupid, which caught me off guard, since there was a time where Scorsese was set to direct. I wonder if he could have made it work. The only good that's worth mentioning is that the setting is very pretty to look at, shot at times beautifully, which at least adds a certain atmosphere to the film and lastly there was some fun gore and unintentionally funny scenes.

The sets and scenes are impressive and they have a great cast. But since the acting is mediocre it doesn't really matter. I don't care about any of these characters, they are all flat and boring.The bad stuff is really bad. I guessed the ending within the first half of the film. There is almost no tension in the movie. They film strange flashbacks with Val Kilmer that have almost nothing to do with the main plot. The action is boring and almost non-existent. Finally the majority of the music sucked. They have this one silly song that repeats continuously throughout the film and it detracts all tension. Finally my favorite part is the scenes revolving around the 2020 World Cup and J.K. Simon's.

Fortunately, I have read all the novels in the series, so I understood all the background of the characters which was mostly skimmed over or poorly displayed.A real shame, because Jo Nesbø's books are incredibly layered and nuanced and keep you guessing. Whereas this movie changes much more interesting aspects of the original story to instead regurgitate typical Hollywood thriller plot lines.On top of all that, they relegate a couple of semi-major and entertaining characters to nameless ones with a few meaningless lines in the film. And they didn't even pronounce the main character's name correctly.

But that was the mystery of it, and maybe others didn't appreciate it. :(From my perspective, The Snowman was written more like a Mystery than a Thriller and they did a Good Job in this film.",The Snowman

And I must compliment Tomas Alfredson for a brilliant film adaptation of Jo Nesbo's work. Although the book's conclusion is twisted in another direction, the finale explains what happens when married women have illicit sex with a lover while their adolescent children wait in the car outside; the victims' children have different fathers from the men they believe to be their father. Even Harry Hole's son, Oleg, is ignorant of who his real father is because his mother Rakel, Harry's ex-girlfriend, believes the boy isn't ready to accept the answer. Enjoy this movie, and look forward to the Son by Jo Nesbo that's about a young man in prison confessing to the crimes of others, but he breaks out to avenge his murdered father.

230,magda_butra,"what's wrong with the movie ""Snowman"" in 5 steps",2,18 January 2018,"It has nothing to do with a book. It has nothing to do with a good movie either. ""Snowman"" was one of those books that I (and probably million fans) was longing to see on the screen. It's on a scale with Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings or Twilight. Worldwide phenomenon. So the expectations were high, at least for me. But even if you simply want to watch a good thriller, you will be disappointed as well. Let's try to talk about this movie in 5 steps.Step 1: what is it all aboutFirst things first. ""Snowman"" is the seventh book from a book series about detective Harry Hole, written by a Norwegian author Jo Nesbø. This volume is considered to be the breaking point - it brought fame and success to Nesbø. From now on the Holemania lasts.""Snowman"" is about a serial killer, who murders unfaithful women. Usually they are married with kids. Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender), who at this stage of his life fights (again) with alcoholism and the fact of losing Rakel (Charlotte Gainsbourg), receives a letter from the killer, kind of an invitation to play in hide and seek. Harry works on the case with Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) who also tries to solve a case from her past. Thanks to this we can look at poorly preserved face of Val Kilmer, starring as Gert Rafto, former star of the Bergen police. In addition to that Harry and Katrine investigate a case of women trafficing, what leads them to Arve Støp (J.K. Simmons). To add a cherry on top, Harry has personal problems. He tries to remain close with Rakel's son, Oleg (Michael Yates), despite the fact that she has a new partner, Matthias (Jonas Karlsson).",The Snowman

232,reubenstojan,The Snowman Strikes Cold: A Whole Lot of Talent In A Fascinating Mess,3,8 February 2020,"""You can't force the pieces to fit"". A wise piece of advice from the lead detective character that those involved in the making of The Snowman may need to examine.In what can only be described as one of the strangest movie experiences of the year, The Snowman is a curiously constructed mess where multiple story threads do not quite fit together and a cast of characters float around, struggling to find purpose. It would not be the first time a crime thriller has collapsed under its own ambition, but when so many talented individuals are involved, one can only ask where it all went DEEPLY wrong.This convoluted tale of murder and mayhem takes place in Oslo, a city already well established in the genre by more successful, gripping Nordic crime dramas. The disappearance of a mother leads to the re-opening of a decades-old investigation into a killer that slays their victims in hideous fashion, leaving behind a calling card of a snowman at the scene of every crime. Not necessarily a winning story formula sure, but with Tomas Alfredson, who directed two of the greatest films of the last decade (Let The Right One In and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy) at the helm, dirt was bound to be made into gold. Not to mention a cast that involves A-list actors such as Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Gainsbourg, J.K. Simmons, Toby Jones, Val Kilmer and Chloe Sevigny. However, the final result comes out as by far, one of the most perplexing cinematic disasters to be seen in a while.There are bad films, but then there are those that are clearly unfinished, abandoned by their makers and left to scurry for life.
The problems arise almost immediately with an opening sequence so awfully edited; it would seem to be purposefully stylised to appear vague. If that is the case, boy; does it fail terribly. Without spoilers, the relevance of this scene to the rest of the plot does come to light later, but if anything, it adds to the confusion, falling so hard on its face and having zero impact value.The Snowman does eventually settle for a slower pace to introduce the main players of the film and set up the murders, but it progresses at a snail's pace. The first murder does not occur until about forty minutes into the film, trying to develop the lead detective of Harry Holes, played by Fassbender. This would be fine, but Harry's background story is so vanilla (drunkard, divorced, unreliable father, but oh apparently genius detective), this can really drag on. To add insult to injury, they fail to develop him very well anyway. Random cues to him waking up on the street are the only real indication of his drinking problem and him being a respected (legend as the film calls him) member of the police force are never really proven in the face of solving this murder.Rebecca Ferguson's Katrine fairs better as a rookie officer working alongside Harry who may have more at stake in this case than it would appear, but even her character by the end is poorly dealt with to make way for a deeply unnecessary complication in solving the case. In fact, it is fair to say most of the characters get lost within the grander scheme of the story. Most obvious is JK Simmons, who plays a seedy businessman with possible connections to woman trafficking and the Snowman killer, which becomes a major sub-plot, only to fizz out by the third act. You then have the out-of-the-blue flashbacks involving Val Kilmer's drunkard cop and his partner (Toby Jones) that has such a limp reason to exist at all, it could have easily been told through a one-minute explanation scene.At its core, The Snowman suffers from incoherence and lack of flow. It is so sloppily put together and paced, one could easily blame a hack editor but shockingly; Alfredson involved award-winning and regular of Scorsese's films (he's executive producing by the way); Thelma Schoonmaker. With the amount of logical gaps and WTF moments happening, this is definitely a case of struggling to piece together unfinished scenes into a coherent whole. I would like to say the film redeems itself by the conclusion, but it all culminates in the dumbest and most anti-climatic ending that will really test patience limits.If anything good can be said about The Snowman, it must be that the look of the film is breathtaking. Alfredson has always been an expert in capturing the bitter chill of winter landscapes and he continues this here. It would make the perfect location for a really thrilling and frightening screenplay. Too bad it's wasted on lousy snowmen.This will definitely go down as one of the most bizarre and disappointing releases of recent memory. There is certainly attraction in seeing how such an incoherent story could find itself released, but with such talent attached (Tomas Alfredson for goodness sake!), it is a tragic exercise in spotting the good movie that might have been if things had not fallen apart so badly. While Alfredson has already come out and admitted there were numerous production problems, it is hopeful we will find out more about what led to such an unfinished mess.",The Snowman
233,andrbdeea,Visually stunning & constant tension,8,15 October 2017,The movie has a rapid pace from the first 2 minutes.

234,DJNormand,Going by the book would have made a better film,6,26 November 2017,"Literally, The Snowman is from a series of books called the Harry Hole series, the seventh to be exact from Norwegian crime writer Joe Nesbo.Reading the plot of the entire story on Wikipedia makes far more sense than the changes the screen writers made in order to put it to film. Why they do this, I have no idea. The book was far more interesting plus there was closure to the story.I only gave this film an eight due to the beautiful cinematography and the stellar cast involved which was a terrible waste of their talent. I can't believe Michael Fassbender even signed up for this film.What the screen writers did was make a a great novel into a nonsensical film with plot holes galore, no explanation of hardly anything vital to understanding the story and no closure. You don't develop a sense of who these characters really are. It's almost as if the viewer is a voyeur looking into a glass darkly but gets no satisfaction of what they're witnessing.Oh, and don't bother looking at the trailer because several events were changed. The trailer gives the impression that the Snowman blew up the cabin with Harry's family inside. It never happens.With Martin Scorsese on board I expected a great film but came away with total emptiness and confusion.At this point I intend on buying the book to get the real story because it is an intriguing concept for a serial killer to leave a snowman at every murder. Now, I want to know why.",The Snowman
235,John-564-342449,"Borderline incoherent, incomprehensible & one of the worst-edited films ever",2,20 October 2017,"What happened to this movie ?That's a much more interesting question, than anything this destroyed artifact has to offerEverything about this project looked so good: World class cast, director, cinematographer, editors, producers, writer, all based on a bestselling thriller: I couldn't wait to see it.Executive producer Martin Scorsese even wanted to direct it himself years ago, so it couldn't possibly be bad, because that man knows his stuff, right?I didn't read the novel and avoided any plot description because I wanted to enjoy a good thriller without knowing too much. But if anyone tells you, that he 'understood' the plot and character motivations of this mess, then you know he's lying or he's talking about the novel.The director Tomas Alfredson - who did such a fantastic job on ""Tinker, Tailer, Soldier Spy"", which was hard to follow sometimes, too, but did make sense - said in an interview, that 10-15 % of the screenplay were not shot. No joke. And these were pretty important pages, it seems, because the lead characters sometimes behave in incomprehensible ways. What the motivation of the killer was, is still an enigma to me.Because key scenes were missing, the producers probably thought: ""Hey, we'll just hire the best editors and they'll solve the problem somehow!"" Thelma Schoonmaker and Claire Simpson are indeed two of the best editors in the world, but if not even they could construct something like a story out of the footage, then something went deeply wrong during the shoot.The footage itself looks great. Oscar winner Dion Beebe is at the top of his game here and every shot is artfully composed and feels just right: Cold, sinister, grey, realistic, but still beautifully stylized. We are talking here about award-worthy cinematography, no less.The acting is good, too, especially the beautiful Rebecca Ferguson and Michael Fassbender, who is too young for this part, but gives a decent performance.Yes, there are some ridiculous scenes, especially the idiotic showdown, where Harry Hole survives and catches the killer by pure coincidence, but good producers could have fixed this through re-shoots. They didn't even try, it seems. They just gave up, because it was a lost cause.How could the producers, screenwriters and director destroy a project that had so much going for it ?This is one of the worst films of the year & one of the strangest film artifacts ever released in cinemas. It could serve as an example for filmmakers how NOT to edit a film or how NOT to tell a story.I only gave it 2/10 because of the cinematography & I felt sorry for the actors.A crime against cinema.",The Snowman

Even Fassbender, an excellent actor, couldn't save this mess of a film. The plot wandered and lacked an overall cohesive feel; much of the original material from the book was left out, and I found my focus wandering. The best thing - and the only thing commendable about this movie - was the snow and the atmospheric rendering of Jo Nesbo's novel into film. It failed to deliver in every other respect. The script adaptation was a big mess and failed to capture the tension, or character development, particularly of the main character, of the novel.

The ending was a little ""quick"" and anticlimatic, but ok...why drag it out until it gets boring, right ? The scene at the lake with the clouds in the background was so beautiful. I found the movie kind of...odd. Something felt off about it...I cant quite put my finger on it. It felt weird in an strange way...like when u cant make up ur mind if its actually meant to be like that in a genious way...or not. It was directed by a swede...someone who knows about nordic oddity. So Im guessing it was deliberate. Most importantly...I ended up enjoying the movie...it was like a weird, trippy journey through a beautiful norwegian winter landscape. I have been to most of the locations in the movie. I was actually in the city of Bergen during the time of filming. I remember it was a very special winter atmosphere in the city those days...it was snowing and a thick fog covered the city for many days...there was a goulish, creepy atmosphere at nighttime. Im disappointed they didnt send a cameraman around the city to capture some of this atmosphere to include in the movie. But ok. All in all I liked the movie...it kind of stuck with me after I had watched it...the violine theme playing in my mind, caught myself thinking about the odd, twisted beautiful ride the movie took me on. Dont believe the 1 star reviews. Its not a perfect masterpiece, but its definitely not the rare disaster many make it out to be. Dont listen to book fanboys who slam the movie for not being true enough to the book. If u want the book version, read the book.

240,JoeBagz,Poor Storytelling in Norway in Winter,3,22 January 2018,"No spoilers. Pretty bad effort, not a good film based on a novel, which I did not read. The Plot: Burned out/damaged detective while investigating the disappearance of a woman, fears the return of an elusive serial killer. The plot I thought had real possibilities, the trailers for the film looked great... The screenplay was I think a huge part of the problem; it was all over the place. Lots of short scenes that lead nowhere, leave you wondering if you blinked and missed something important. Then it happens again and again and again. Subplots started then forgotten about making for a total absence of cohesive story telling... Based on the result it would seem three writers was a really bad idea. Direction: was weak or perhaps more accurately, missing, limited to vague/pained facial expressions. Zero character development, made the lead and the supporting cast far less interesting than the landscape where the story takes place. Cinematography: was very good, a bright spot making excellent use of the harsh weather winter in Norway. The cast: employed many screen veterans who's talents went unused. Just faces passing in and out of disjointed scenes. The Climax: pathetic, like the writers just wanted it over and done with. There ought to be a refund available for film ending's that are this bad.

246,noahlenzi,A Beautiful Disaster,4,26 October 2017,"From the look of the trailer, The Snowman appeared to be a welcome call back to the string of serial killer thrillers that became popular in the 90s. These films usually consisted of a killer with some kind of trademark, in Se7en it was the seven deadly sins, now it's snowmen. Things looked bright for this film as the cast consists of great actors like Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson, Toby Jones and J. K. Simmons. The director, Tomas Alfredson, has also made critically acclaimed thrillers such as Let the Right One In and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. The list of talent attached to this film would put anyone under the impression that the movie would be good at the very least. Michael Fassbender plays world famous Norwegian detective Harry Hole (I laughed too) in this adaptation of Jo Nesbø's novel of the same name. The concept involves multiple disappearances in that occur across several years all linking to a killer that leaves snowmen at the scene of every crime. It sounds like a fun thriller but it saddens me to say that The Snowman is one of this year's biggest disasters. Virtually everything about this film doesn't work and I don't say this as some pretentious remark. Really the only saving grace of this film is Dion Beebe's incredible cinematography. The best way to address the many problems of this film is to start at the beginning. The film opens with the child that will grow up to be the snowman killer. He lives with his mother and an abusive biological father who beats his mother. The mother threatens to tell the father's wife that the child is his. This sets him off and he says they'll never see him again then gets in his car and leaves. Problem solved right? As he leaves the mother and child chase him down in their car, screaming for him to come back. Why? As I sat in the theater I thought to myself that this was one of those things that would be explained later and that there was something more to this opening flashback. No. This is one of one of the many confusing aspects of the story that are thrown in as a plant for a reveal later but are never paid off. This aspect alone makes the film one of the most confusing I've seen in years, and not in a good way. Themes are also introduced at the start of the film only to return as paradoxical and laughable messages that make the least bit of sense. The film also contains one of the most underwhelming climaxes that honestly gives Fan4stic's final ""battle"" a run for its money. The story is essentially just a whodunit where they dump a couple suspicious looking characters into the mix and it's up to the audience to decide which one it is. There could have been at least some attempt to connect all these suspicious characters but instead we get a completely disjointed subplot about some underground sex ring involving the world cup that went absolutely nowhere. It doesn't even connect to the killer whatsoever and is never solved. The main characters are hollow and have very little involvement in the case itself. They build up Harry's character like he's some legend but he's just one of the dumbest cops ever put to film. It's almost like things just happen for them and the clues are given to them. This destroys all tension and we never truly get a suspenseful moment but when it does attempt to be scary its hilarious. All of these problems turn the film into a mess but what does the most damage by far is the goddamn editing in this movie.This is some of the worst editing of the year. I'm not just talking about the moments where they obviously made jump cuts in the middle of shots to make them move faster. The scene to scene editing will leave everyone confused, you'll wonder why certain scenes weren't placed before or later or how characters got from point A to point B. In my opinion, editing is the most important process in filmmaking. It's where the final product is produced and if it's in the wrong hands even a good film can be edited down to a piece of garbage. I think had they re-edited this film it would have actually been OK. There are definitely scenes missing from this movie and I think it's one of the reason why none of the themes and subplots amount to anything.In the end, The Snowman is a beautiful disaster. It contains some of today's best talents only to throw them into one of the most well shot ambitious pieces of garbage ever. According to the director, 15-20 percent of the script wasn't even shot and it shows. The movie has a few moments that made me laugh out loud but it's not worth seeing and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they wanted to see how bad it was. This is one of Fassbender's many recent duds and I hope he can get back on track before he does a career ender. So my recommendation would be to miss this one and go see the Blade Runner sequel instead.",The Snowman
247,Micubano,Total Waste Of Time,1,26 October 2017,"Right in the beginning I remember thinking that one scene was going to be like something from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but then nothing happened. And nothing kept happening for a long, long time. I got pretty quickly that the main character is tragically flawed. Stop shoving it down my throat and get to a story. For a long time I felt like I was watching Ralph Mellish by Monty Python, but it wasn't funny.It had elements that I usually really like in a film, like a story not told in chronological order, twins, and J.K. Simmons. But everything that this movie did was pure frustration. There was no focus and it drifted everywhere. The lead character kept overlooking the most obvious clues, but I guess that is what happens when your main character is overly flawed and not at all relatable in anyway. He wasn't a protagonist, antagonist, hero, or anti-hero. He was just there for most of the movie.If you like Nordic scenery, then this is a great movie. Just wait for it to come out on HBO or Netflix. The main character's name is Harry Hole and that is exactly were it feels like this movie came from. The trailer was better than the movie.In one scene a nipple was shown and that was my favorite part of the movie. Not because there was anything special about that scene, but because the 70ish year old guy behind me chucked like a little boy when he saw it and he was sitting next to his wife.

Also, why is it always model-like actors who get the leads in movies? It's just a snore, really. I watch English movies more and more because they have a deep bench of actors of all ages who are not afraid to show their real, well earned wrinkles.

It did, but only so we could both laugh about how bad it was afterwards.Having read the book I am completely familiar with the story, but when my partner said ""that's the killer"" the second they showed up on screen, I knew we were in for a lot of dross, as it was painfully predictable.Let me start by saying this is a seriously boring movie. Nothing happens for the majority of the running time. I can't believe this was made from the novel, which is gripping and filled with complex and interesting characters.There are many subplot points introduced which are completely unnecessary to the the overall story and you can't help but feel that a lot of this movie was left on the cutting room floor. This is a perfect example of when the trailer is better than the finished product and that has obviously helped this movie a lot financially, as every screening for the day I went to see it was a complete sell-out.Performance-wise, nothing is inspiring. Fassbender is probably one of the top actors working today, but he completely phones it in. Val Kilmer is wasted and I was distracted by the way he talks in the film every time he was on screen. There was something off about it. Can someone even tell me what the point of having J.K. Simmons in this film was? An excellent character actor given absolutely nothing to work with, except an unintentional comedy moment that had us both laughing loudly in the cinema.I'm giving this 3 points simply for the stunning Norwegian scenery but I think that's being generous. I normally like to inject my reviews with a bit of comedy but there's nothing funny about this complete waste of a great story and great actors. Unless we're talking about ""that"" J.K.

I kinda craved for something more since the beginning of the movie promised such notion. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie, If you like investigative-thriller, you'd love it. I recommend it.",The Snowman

259,mooviesuniverse,'The Snowman' is a promising project on paper but turns out to be a huge dud on the screen,4,17 December 2017,"After a woman disappears, detective Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) receives an ominous note. He teams up with young recruit Katrine Bratt (Rebecca Ferguson) to solve the mystery.The movie, produced by Martin Scorsese, is an adaptation of the bestselling novel by Jo Nesbo. Tomas Alfredson is in the director's seat, Thelma Schoonmaker came on board to edit and you have an international cast led by Michael Fassbender. If you take a look at the names involved this movie should have been a home run. It wasn't.Alfredson who has proven he's capable of making good movies ('Let the right one in', 'Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy'), fails miserably. The reason as to why it went so wrong is as puzzling as the movie itself. Apparently Alfredson was quoted as saying: ""Our shoot time in Norway was way too short, we didn't get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing."" That of course explains a lot. Furthermore according to the director 15% of the screenplay was never filmed. Too bad that was the 15% containing all the tension and thrills because watching 'The Snowman' is about as interesting as watching a snowman melt.Fassbender tries to save what is left but there's very little to his character. A brilliant detective with an alcohol problem. He sure seems drunk enough. Brilliant not so much. Then again Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot wouldn't have caught the killer based on the 'clues' Harry Hole (excellent name) gets in the movie.
Rebecca Ferguson's character has some backstory. She's about the only one. JK Simmons and Sofia Helin (The bridge) are severely underused.A small positive is some of the cinematography by Dion Beebe. Shot in Norway we get to see some beautiful scenery. The setting was nice but although it's set in Norway and the characters are supposed to be Norwegian they all speak English with a different accent. Even the papers are in English. If snow is the only reason for shooting in Norway they might as well have moved the whole thing to Alaska or Colorado for example.Worst part of all is that there has to be a good movie somewhere in this mess. Who knows? Maybe someday Alfredson finds the parts that are missing and we get an amazing director's cut. One can dream.",The Snowman

262,doktorwho,Bad but funny,4,7 January 2018,"Ok, so I haven't read the book, but I like watching a good thriller once in while, the trailer promised a nice Scandinavian film noir with great actors like Fassbender, Gainsbourg and even Val Kilmer , what could go wrong?.. Plenty apparently.Good things first.
The cinematography generally is lovely, great setting with this weird dark film noir settings, interiors with classic 70s IKEA furnitures in about every houses. In fact some of the details are so strange that it pulls you out of the usual stuffy feeling noir thrillers usually give you. . In one scene the detectives are working in what looks like an abandoned library, concentrated on their desk while police officers literally skated around with the book rolling tables , it all looked so weirdly surrealistic , I couldn't help but laugh.You'll see also lovely opening shots of sceneries from Norway, the coastal cities as well as the mountain, at times this movie felt more like a tourism commercial than a thriller, in that aspect it succeeded.Now the bad...
The plot is completely disjointed and finish abruptly , the motives of the numerous characters are at best unclear, some of them are never followed upon, as the director must have lost interest in the middle of the movie.
The actors did their best they could with their script, but in many of the scenes , it's if themselves didn't seem to understand their own lines.
The killer who you'll guess the identity after half an hour seems more weird than scary and while the murders are ghastly, they're so strange and out of place that it felt more like a mediocre episode of X-files . There is also an attempt of romance in there somewhere, but that too falls on its face. Luckily the movie goes into this area where it's so bad it's funny, which make it an enjoyable experience in my book. I'd definitely recommend it to a show like the Red Letter Media to review as a schlock on YouTube. If you can't appreciate the humorous mediocrity, you'll like the cinematography and lovely scenic shots. So this movie, while not a good thriller, will probably not feel like a complete waste of time, just don't take it seriously.",The Snowman

It tended to feel like a stomp through knee high snow rather than the slick pacy thriller the trailer would have you believe it to be. The partnership between Fassbender and Ferguson feels contrived and as a result fails to grow the emotional capital required to make you feel anything towards the end. I also found the twist too plainly signposted. The stark colour palette of the film helped emphasise the remote beauty of this film's location, but a little distraction might have been welcome. Ultimately this film makes you wait a long time for something to happen, and when it finally does it feels like scant reward for your efforts.",The Snowman

This is why people pirate movies.",The Snowman
269,tomfry-10237,"A boring, hollow, soulless disappointment",3,23 October 2017,"'The Snowman' is directed by Tomas Alfredson and stars Michael Fassbender, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Gainsbourg. Based on Jo Nesbø's novel of the same name, 'The Snowman' focuses on Detective Harry Hole, a washed up cop seeking an interesting new case to reinvigorate himself, before discovering a cryptic note addressed to his name: a note linked to missing women, broken families and icy snowmen marking the presence of death.As someone who never got around to viewing Alfredson's previous work such as 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' I personally wasn't overly excited for his new project when I first heard about it, yet over time my interest piqued as I learned of the involvement of credited actors Fassbender and Ferguson amongst others, as well as an intriguing, promising trailer. It therefore pains me to say that this film is a messy, convoluted disappointment. From a plot that has no idea where it is going to characters that are two dimensional and hollow, this is one of the most forgettable experiences of 2017.The most fundamental element dictating any film's success above all else, is in its ability to maintain a cohesive narrative that takes the audience on a journey, clearly having something to say regarding the world around us by the end. 'The Snowman' certainly has opinions, yet it conveys them in such a sloppy, unfocused way that these messages have nowhere near the impact intended. Additionally, the film appears to have no idea what is going to happen next, with random sub-plots ham-fisted into the story with little to no pay off, simply leaving you wondering why they are there to begin with. It truly lends to the sense of a rushed production, and consequently the absence of finesse.Furthermore, all of the characters are two dimensional and flat. They all fall into well worn crime drama caricatures: the washed up detective, the corrupt businessman, the young officer with a hidden agenda. Yet unfortunately, they all fail to escape these stereotypes to become something truly fresh and interesting due to a lack of inspired writing and any true surprises in their character arcs. This leaves them in the shadow of far more three dimensional, complex characters in similar works, such as Idris Elba's Luther and Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes in their respective BBC Drama's, suggesting that maybe this story was better off told as a TV drama, with more time to expand on character and motive.The only positives I can really find here is that all of the performances, shots and soundscapes incorporated are good; they aren't anything groundbreaking yet are the only elements that manage to suspend your disbelief whilst every other aspect of the film tries its hardest to pull you out of the experience.The word that comes to mind when thinking about this film is passable. Usually, that would not be too bad.I could say 'The Snowman' is a passable film perfect for the background of a Sunday afternoon, because in reality that is exactly the type of film that it is. Yet I then recall that the creative team behind this are some of the most talented creatives working in the industry today, and I personally expect better. Therefore, I have to say 'The Snowman' is a true disappointment, a passable experience that should have been a mesmerisingly haunting one. It is forgettable, it is lacklustre, but most regretfully, it is incredibly dull.",The Snowman
270,ekontrovitz,What's all the fuss about?,7,15 June 2019,"I stumbled upon this movie by accident but as I love thrillers I watched. I was shocked to see such terrible reviews but I think I know why. Once someone pans a movie everyone else doesn't want to be seen as so unsophisticated as to disagree. I disagree. Is this the best thriller I've ever seen? No. Is it the worst? Also no. Many of the criticisms are somewhat true IMHO, but many are just silly. Really? The music intrusive? If you think about it ALL movie music is intrusive. When was the last time there was music in the background of you life? Movie music sets the mood and the music in The Snowman did it just right.
The action disjointed. I can agree with that to a degree, which is why it's not a 10. Val Kilmer's dubbed voice. My question is not why his voice was dubbed because it has been explained by other commenters. My question is why either he didn't back out because of his cancer treatment, or why they cast him in the first place because he obviously was ill. The silliest criticism I read was the one about why the actors all had British accents. Well it's probably because they were largely British. If the movie had been cast with all American actors the accent would have been American. Did the critics expect everyone to try a Norwegian accent? Then I'm sure that would have been criticized. Have any of you watched Wallander? Maybe not.
I thought the movie had flaws, some large, but at the end I liked it more than disliked it. I don't care if the director, or critics don't. Would I recommend it? Yes, to those who like thrillers. In the end I think viewers know pretty quickly if they want to continue watching a movie or not. If you didn't like it but continued to watch you probably didn't hate it as much as you said. Give this movie a try. Turn it off if you hate it.",The Snowman

I had seen the bad reviews but wanted to see for myself. After all I often enjoy films despite critics panning them.But the movie is a mess. A lovely mess, beautiful cinematography. Decent score. I already mentioned the cast being excellent (I love Fassbender and Ferguson)...But you can tell something went very wrong in the shooting and editing of this film. Plot points are rushed over or flat out ignored. There is very little in the way of character development. The killer's motivation never seemed clear or made much sense. The investigation scenes feel sloppy and all over the place. Then there are the problems with taking a lead character seriously who has a name like Harry Hole. And what were they thinking dubbing over Val Kilmer's voice? It sounds unnatural and the lip syncing is badly done. Very distracting.So this time I have to agree with the critics.

Harry Hole is the absolute epitome of ""standard cop in a crime novel/move"". Drunk, but brilliant, women love him, but can't be with him, yada, yada, yada. So now that his ex-girlfriend and her son are living with another man, he is still in her son's life, but forgets about him when there's a big case. Definitely some strange editing choices, meaning that scenes were cut and then we were left wondering why something did or didn't happen, just what??Val Kilmer. Does he really look like or was he made up to look like that? I was so distracted by his scenery chewing that it was barely understandable what was going on with that aspect of the case. Michael Fassbender is fine as well other performances, except Val Kilmer as mentioned above. Although, Michael Fassbender seemed to be sleepwalking through it all. Question for someone in Norway. Do houses and buildings really have such large windows, including windows between rooms and rooms and the hallway? Seems like nothing good can come of that.There are a couple of minutes of atmosphere that are good. Also, it's too bad there aren't more Norwegians as main characters in the movie.

Tones of blue accentuate the season and the sound of crunching snow provides effective sensory stimulation to get the vision across.Cinematography is straightforward and effective. I feel the framing is neither uninspired nor radical. The story, however, is long and drawn out. Names are quickly and casually thrown about and then not mentioned, only to resurface 20 minutes later. What is the mystery here, where is this story going? is a question I found myself asking 45 minutes into the 120 minute film.Character motives aren't well defined until the end, an idea that works for antagonists but serves to confuse the viewer when it comes to the detectives and the children.Sadly, I found myself fighting to stay awake after 70 minutes of ""The Snowman"". I feel that critical reviews comparing it to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are wholly misleading and built expectations beyond what the director was able to deliver.Awarded 4 of 10 stars for effective use of sound, lighting, and mise en scene to bring the viewer into the frigid world of mid-winter Norway.",The Snowman

Michael Fassbender put in a really good performance.The visuals and cinematography were great. It was wonderfully shot and the locations looked beautiful.The soundtrack wasn't too bad, it built up the tension when it needed too.The one issue I've noticed people point out is that it feels like a mess and the pacing isn't great. I agree with this to some extent. At points in the movie it does feel a bit jumbled, but I feel like this was done on purpose, because some of this confusion is covered and made sense of in the third act.The third act is probably the best part of the film, the build up to the conclusion was done well, and it leaves you on the edge of your seat.

Putting that issue aside, there are not enough good murder mysteries being made, like Wind River. Nice bonus is that the scenery is spectacular, and the movie is filmed beautifully. It's the story of two detectives from different backgrounds, working together to track down a serial killer in Norway. The pace is slow, but not boring, though I was admittedly ready for the pace to pick up about half way through.

290,JimmyTheFilmCritic,The Snowman,4,19 October 2017,"A totally disjointed film that has a lot going on, but is poorly executed and leaves you feeling confused and asking yourself why is the killer so into snowmen for? I'll confess I've not read the book by Jo Nesbø so maybe it's explained better in the book, but in the film it isn't explained at all. What's even worst, it's pretty obvious who the killer was from quite early on which I hate. Because half the fun is trying to figure out who's done it. You never really connect to any of the characters either. So when they're in danger you don't particularly care and the killer's motive for doing what he/she were doing was a little thin for my taste. However, I think the biggest problem is the character Harry Hole (Michael Fassbender) the character just doesn't get enough character development for my liking. Apparently The Snowman is the seventh book in the Harry Hole series and that's abundantly clear in this film. No time was given to give us the audience enough insight into his character so we can understand his motivations and why he is the way he is. I think the film could have done with some of that.Overall, it's not worth your time. They're better films out there you can spend your two hours on and it's a shame because the premise was really good. But sadly, it's wasted on this poorly executed film.",The Snowman

His voice had to be overdubbed (badly) throughout which indicates that he decided to make his character even sillier than it ended up being with some terrible add-libbing or a daft voice. The Brando-esque cotton balls in his cheeks make him look truly bizarre and his acting is simply awful.

302,Ravnehjerte93,A disaster,3,11 October 2017,"The Snowman is a disaster. It's not only a disaster, it's an unfathomable disaster. This film had absolutely everything going for it. I've not read the source material, that the film is based on, but it's being hailed as one the best books in its genre here in Norway. The director, Tomas Alfredson, has made some great films in the past and the cast is great. Yet the film is a complete mess.The film actually looks unfinished. It looks like they had a version ready to go, but then some of the countless number of producers stepped in and told them to redo the whole film. Only that it wasn't enough time for them to actually make the new version comprehensible. There are scene transitions that are shockingly bad. Scenes that arrives and ends out of nowhere. Scenes that are included into the film for some reason that no one knows. Scenes that serves absolutely no pay-off, and are sort of just there for being there's sake. If one then takes a look at the trailer to the film, one can clearly see that huge parts of the dialogue and that some of the scenes from the trailer have been cut out of the film. This tells me that there are huge chunks of material left in some editing room out there, that probably would have caused the film to feel a lot more comprehensible.It wastes no time on character development. These type of films requires that audience manages to get inside the lead characters head. We need to be a part of the investigation. We need to feel the frustration and hopelessness of the characters. There's quite simply no emotion here. There's nothing to hold on to, and nothing to make you invested. Michael Fassbender's character features a lot of traits that ought to make him an interesting protagonist, but none of it is explored. It's actually quite baffling to see how neglected it all is. The Snowman got a wide range of characters, but none of them serve any other purpose than to serve the plot. Some of them doesn't even feel needed for that sake. Val Kilmer is one of the most useless characters I've seen in quite some time. For some reason, he was even dubbed.The whole film is entirely built around the plot, and leading up to the revelation of who the snowman killer is. Unfortunately, the film does a poor job of building up the suspense. It's quite frankly boring in huge parts and the revelation is predictable. Aside from the lack of character development and invested emotion (which is very much needed in order to care for a story), the film does a poor job in showcasing the investigation. Too many of the characters are doing things just because. Too much of the film is happening just because. There's very rarely given any reason for why things are happening. The overall plot is easy enough to follow, but in terms of logic it becomes a confusing mess.The Snowman is a mess. It's hard to understand how they managed to mess it up so badly, but they sure did. Aside from some neat visuals and a decent (if slightly forgettable) score, there's not much to enjoy here.",The Snowman
303,vargas42,"Great, great, good, OK, Jesus!, why?, cringe",6,18 November 2017,"I would have initially given The Snowman a rating of 7. Perhaps even an 8... thanks to a solid performance by Michael Fassbender. Even the premise lends itself to one of my favourite genres. However, the anti- climactic ending spoils the fun. It feels unrealistic and... the ice... come on. 6 because of the ice (not the mom's ice, that was pretty good).I would totally watch another one with Fassbender and his finger.",The Snowman

I was really looking forward to the CREEP FACTOR but got very little and was bored through most of the film. Not familiar with the book, but I'd bet too much from the book (additional story lines)was put in the script that took away from what should have been the focus of the film, the detective against the killer. I got lost in what and or why, some characters were in the film. If you are adding characters, make them possible killers. Tease the mind of the viewer. There was basically no direct conflict between the hero and the killer until the very end. And the ending itself was not only predictable but too coincidental. Definitely a PASS.

311,Koala_99,Disappointment...A huge Disappointment,3,17 October 2017,"After I watched the trailer, I thought to myself: ''Wow! This looks amazing!'' But after I watched the film...I became disappointed. When I was watching this in a movie theater, I was constantly hearing voices and whisperings around me and I realised that people, in a movie theater, were constantly chatting and talking, because people, after the first part of the movie, weren't interested anymore in watching it. That's kind of a proof how bad, tedious, awful and boring this film is. Actually, the story is far more interesting than the movie itself. The film had all the equipment and material they needed: the interesting story based on a famous book, the talented cast and crew, fine screenwriters and an amazing director, Tomas Alfredson. He is the director of a film called ''Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy'', and that film was great and I enjoyed it a lot. So my question is: ''What happened?''When the film started, the opening shot was the aerial shot of an beautiful landscape, in this case snowy mountains, after that, an establishing shot, again, of some snowy landscape and than again the establishing shot, but this time of some house settled in the middle of the snowy land, so I said to myself: ''Well, alright...This looks promising...''. But after that, everything became a mess.Here are the reasons why the film is bad:1) Acting, character development and dialogue. Acting was bad. There was no character development. Many characters were goofy and unrealistic. I feel sorry for the actors and actresses, because those are really talented people: Michael Fassbender, Charlotte Gainsbourg, J.K. Simmons, etc. At the beginning of the film, when boy started to scream and yelling to his father to not leave and mother screaming his name, it was really hilarious. The way how they portrayed their characters wasn't serious at all. In many moments in the film, Rebecca Ferguson and Charlotte Gainsbourg had given really awkward and goofy facial expressions. Val Kilmer's character was useless in the film. J.K. Simmons's fake British accent was half decent and half dull. The behaviour of all the characters was strange and awkward. The same goes with the dialogue between the characters, it doesn't make any sense and no one talks like that in real life. The characters are all stingy and selfish for no reason. I think that even the actors and actresses didn't have any idea what they were doing in the film. Maybe, but just maybe, Michael Fassbender was OK. Somehow, he managed to find his way to portray his character as realistic as possible after all this mess that had been created during the film. And maybe Jonas Karlsson, who portrayed the serial killer, was also OK. 2) Editing and pacing. The main reason why this film was so bad, it's mostly because of the editing and pacing. Everything went so fast, from selecting and changing shots, cutting scenes, etc. There were so many useless and boring shots that served no purpose to the storytelling. Each scene in the film contains the amount of pointless shots and fast pacing, that you, as the viewer, have no idea what is going on. For example, is he now in this specific position of the yard or room, or is he somewhere else, etc. Everything leads to confusion.3) Original score, music and sound effects. The music itself was fine, but it didn't quite match with some specific moments and situations in the film. It felt like when every time something intense and interesting is going on, the music doesn't follow the rhythm and atmosphere of this intensity. Sound effects were also useless, especially when they show something scary and terrifying, they add these useless sound effects, which I don't like at all.Honorable mentions: there was one scene when they found the slashed body of woman in some snowy mountains, there were some seagulls and it looked like CGI, but really awful.But still, there were some good things about the film. Visually is beautiful, cinematography is good, there are some well done shots and scenes in the film, for example at the end, when Fassbender's character, detective Harry Hole, confronts with the serial killer on the frozen snowy lake. But if they had made the story that it should had been, maybe I would love that scene even more.Anyway, if you really have the desire and reason to see this film, than fine, but I'm telling you that you'll be disappointed. There are plenty of great films and upcoming films that are worth of your time and attention. Maybe next time, the director will create a better film than this one.3/10",The Snowman

313,davidsmail008,The story with an extremely incredible plot,2,22 October 2017,"I saw the Snowman movie yesterday.  This movie has a most intriguing premise, followed up by a plot that stretched belief, very badly.  The premise is that there is a serial killer on the loose who enjoys 1) making snowmen to memorialize or announce his killings and 2) taunting the police.  Good; right?So, it could be good, but next, we learn, there are a series of leading suspects who are a doctor or business and community leaders . . . and then, as we approach the ending, we learn that the actual evil-doer is a psychologically disturbed orphan who grew up to be both a doctor and a friend to the lead detective . . . a man who has prescribed to the detective some medication he takes!  Now, I could be wrong, but it seems that there are not too many doctors who are sadistic, psychopathic, serial killers.  The medical profession seems to be underrepresented in lists of serial murderers.   This is not a case of Dr Richard Kimble being wrongly convicted for having killed his wife.  This is a medical doctor, one who is not a Nazi, who takes pleasure in cutting off the heads of his victims with garrotes or weapons.Along the way, the police manage to investigate several innocent persons and then, one of the police gets herself killed while in a hotel bed and while she is waiting to seduce another one of the innocent suspects who is mostly innocent.  Somehow the sadistic, psychopathic medical doctor is also very good at covert surveillance of police, and good at unarmed combat with police, and the psychopathic killer then leaves this crime scene without a visible trace of struggle and murder.  OK, that sounds normal.So, the sadistic and psychopathic doctor, psychologically disturbed, has also been auditioning for the role of  Wonder Woman and/or Batman.How we square all these things is not explained, just assumed . . . The once psychologically disturbed orphan is now really a genius, a fighter, a killer and one who also carefully cleans up murder scenes like this one to not leave blood or body parts behind.What we could have had was a movie about a disgruntled car mechanic or a postal worker as a serial killer who enjoyed taunting the police . . . and instead, the murderer is a doctor and a friend of the detective looking for him, in regular contact with him while doing various killings.  Wow.",The Snowman

I am a big fan of thriller/serial killer movies and this one had me entertained all the way through. The cinematography is beautiful. The movie actually makes you put pieces together which is probably why people here didn't enjoy it. I love movies that make me think and try to put things together and when you actually do, it makes sense. Everyone has a different taste in movies. The only negative i had about it was that because the director wasn't able to put all the scenes the filmed into this movie it felt a little rushed but another half hour prob would have been plenty of time to make it an even better film.

Cinematography is beautiful and the plot may have been confusing to some people but aren't most thrillers better when you have to put things together for it to make sense. Some people are just spoiled by having a film explain everything to you right in your face. I like movies that make me think, and this was certainly one of them.

320,jeanne3264,Very Satisfying. I love movies that make me think.,9,11 August 2020,"Like most psychological thrillers, this movie requires some thought & intelligence to enjoy. I didn't find one single scene, conversation, or character to be out of place. This is not the type of movie to watch while under the influence. It is also not the kind of movie to watch if your home is full of distractions - such as kids, visitors, barking, or talking. If you want to watch Animal House, then do that instead!
I loved it, & every time that I watch it, I give it a new higher rating. I watch all complex movies with the captions on. This way, I am able to catch ALL of the dialog, even through strange accents. It helps with the fact that I'm already being hit with a foreign landscape, foreign city, & foreign terminology.
I don't know what the actual author of the book thinks about the movie, but that's what happens. You either write the screenplay yourself, or you take a chance on the end result being different.
I really really enjoy ending a movie with a few questions in my head. Then with each subsequent viewing, I catch more & more. This one does come together wonderfully and all is answered in time. Very Satisfying. Somewhat sexy. Very suspenseful. Very intellectual.
I admit the first time through, I would get all of the sad pale-faced young husbands mixed up. I couldn't keep all of the lonely young mothers separate either. Using the IMOB App to see the list of character names helps me with this. This movie is most enjoyable when you are ready & able to understand it. It was well worth the time for me. I'll watch it again sometime and probably update it from 9 stars to 10.",The Snowman
321,mitymaty99,"I really wanted it to be good, but it's mostly a mess, with great visuals.",5,12 October 2017,"Let's start off with me saying that I loved the source material when I read it a few years ago, and when I saw that it's gonna get a movie adaptation I was really hyped for it. This movie had every chance of being something amazing, the book it's based on, the director, the cast would all be amazing, but somehow they messed the whole thing up. They changed parts of the book without thinking how it would effect the whole story, there are scenes in the trailer that are completely missing from the movie, and they didn't put enough time into character development. The first half showed some potential, but in the end there were multiple plot lines left hanging without much explanation. Plus they totally dumbed down the killer and his motivation, and messed up the killer reveal(that was really well done in the book, at least in my opinion), and the endgame. The killer runs away with Harry's loaded gun, but Harry the super-detective doesn't think that he might come back and shoot them, so he unties Rakel and Oleg to have a little emotional time....And then he runs out to chase down the killer who could just be hiding around the house to shoot him in the back, but no. Harry just goes after him, although he has no idea which way the killer might have gone. And when he catches up he gets shot, and he starts discussing that the killer has a wrong ideology just so he would walk closer. But why did the killer have to take a few more steps at the end? He could have shot Harry from that range easily, but no, he had to go really close, so he can fall into that conveniently placed hole in the ice and die. Oh and I just absolutely loved that they teased the adaptation for The Leopard, but seeing how this movie fell on its face I highly doubt that we'll see that happen soon, or maybe ever. I expected more from Tomas Alfredson, although it's not entirely his fault how this turned out. But at least you can see the beautiful landscapes of Norway, right?",The Snowman

If you are not in that category, I can see how the movie would seem slow and methodical. This is classic Norwegian noir brought to you by the same Director who did the classic ""Let The Right One In"". The mere fact that so many high profile actors chose such small roles just to work on this film (J.K. Simmons, Val Kilmer, Toby Jones, Jame D'Arcy, et. al) shows just how important this work is. At times, it was almost distracting to see so many recognizable faces while trying to follow the grisly tale of The Snowman Killer.

328,messie-54717,Complete garbage,1,1 November 2017,"I've never written a review here before, but I honestly feel like I have a responsibility to warn potential movie-goers.There are several deeply disturbing issues with The Snowman, which can't be saved by a partially good cast and a nice setting. I'm not going to go into details, because I can't remember most of it, since it was so incredibly boring, but I'll sum up the most crucial things.First, the movie is based on a highly regarded book, and it goes out of it's way to not live up to it. At the same time it seems like the movie actually hasn't got a screenplay, but rather is using the book straight up as a screenplay. This is evidenced by the horribly executed dialogue and off-beat cuts between scenes.Secondly, the most cringe thing about the movie, aside from everything being so frustratingly off, is that the producers felt it a good idea to set the movie in Norway, with exactly everyone having overly Scandinavian names, and then having almost everyone speak English with bad accents, pronouncing the names in the worst most Americanised way possible. This would seem like a somewhat good idea if you only want to cater to an English-speaking audience, but absolutely nothing in this movie requires it to be set in Norway, other than the books initiative. So why not just place it in Canada instead? Or better yet, just let everyone speak the actual Norwegian language.Okay, burst rant: The story is all over the place, You can see that the actors know that they are working on a bad movie, the big-name actors are completely irrelevant (especially Val Kilmer), everything that's slightly interesting can be seen in the first minute of the trailer, and the ending is so bad, it's just a big slap in the face of the viewer.It straight up feels as if the director and editors are young teenagers working on their first project in school, and have no idea what they are doing. This wouldn't be so bad, if the movie didn't take itself so seriously. But it actually gives off the impression that the plot-points are somehow intelligent, when it's the most watered down drink you can possibly imagine.I rank this movie in the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen. And that's the list of movies that are actually bad, not entertainingly bad. And it's on the absolute top of my list of movies that doesn't respect it's viewers.

Absolutely nothing makes sense in the film. It is difficult to understand the storyline if you have no idea about the book. Editing is so awful that I really don't know why some scenes are in the film as they are totally irrelevant.I think it also affected the cast's acting performances.

So what happened, it was terrible? The book had a reasonable premise, which gave the protagonist a reasonable motivation which the film completely ignored. Why would the scriptwriters do that.

However, having lived in Oslo for 9 years, it was fun to see familiar places and spot the fake ones. One of the locations used multiple times in the movie is also the physics building at the university, where I had my office at the time of the filming (early 2016). I walked through the set, and waited behind the camera, on several occasions, so I was additionally curious as to where familiar places would show up in the final movie. I will admit this was the main reason I watched the movie in the first place.The movie has captured quite well the somewhat sombre mood that is so common in many Norwegian productions, only lightened by the ever present bright, white snow. It also works well for the story - the theme is after all snow.The actors do a decent job at portraying the somewhat uninteresting characters, and the pace of the movie is a bit too slow for my taste. The main plot is fine, although I suspect the book is better. The subplots seem a bit disconnected at times, but the ending ties quite well with the beginning wrapping it all up nicely.Not a fantastic movie, but these somewhat standard serial killer plots tend to feel a bit recycled anyway.

So much depends on the viewer having faith that they're joining the dots themselves, or are are so dazzled by the star cast to notice that it really is a bit of a shambles of a screenplay.

Rebecca Ferguson shines as rookie cop Katrine Bratt. But what on earth was Val Kilmer doing? Certainly wasn't acting. His character was weird and out of place.

339,edkpgh,Interesting Murder Mystery,7,1 January 2018,"A nearly two hour movie, the pace is a bit slow but does build up to a climax. It was a bit odd watching a Norwegian movie where the entire film is English language, and had several notable Hollywood stars in it. As for the film itself, some of the character development leaves a bit to be desired. Perhaps it's just the way the story is told, in a non-Hollywood traditional way. There's a number of gory murder scenes and even though there is not much suspense as to who the killer ends up being, there is a good bit of suspense in the movie. The way the killer dies at the end is a bit lame, but at the same time, fitting given earlier events of the film.There's lots of spectacular scenery that really helps add to the film, and some good dialogue. The movie has it's flaws, but overall, worth checking out.",The Snowman
340,mark01254,The first movie ever to make me fall asleep in a cinema,3,23 October 2017,"As a big fan of horror and crime movies, especially the ones that are set in Nordic countries, which usually guarantees for a special atmosphere, this movie left me disappointed, bored and exhausted.With such a brilliant cast and having the very successful novel by Jo Nesbø as a background, expectations were high. And indeed, the film work itself, having Dion Beebe behind the camera and Thelma Schoonmaker as a cutter is good, but it simply doesn't compensate for a plot that massively lacks integrity, for bland and shallow characters whose actors would've offered so much more potential, for a complete lack of thrill and for inconsistencies on all levels. They even missed the chance to show a victim actually fighting for their life - the snowman is obviously prepared for everything.The trailer pretty is pretty much reduced to every thrilling moment this movie is offering, the snowman itself (now talking about the actual fella made of snow) doesn't really play a major role at all, it's almost cringeworthy to see it randomly stand somewhere at a crime scene, but in the movie it appears completely irrelevant to the story itself. Obviously, the snowman was supposed to be a signature similar to Jigsaw's clown mask or the stick dolls that represented the presence of the Blair Witch, but after all it seemed to me that it was just a random pick and after all it doesn't play any role other than making for a tired laugh in the audience whenever a grim snowman can be seen peaking through the window.There was a lot of potential - interesting characters with background stories, a great setting with a dark and hibernal Norwegian landscape, but the director completely wasted it.I've seen thousands of movies but this one was the first one ever that had me fall asleep and that made people leave the theater before it finished. I also never observed so many people from the audience leave to take a toilet break or have a smoke because they quickly noticed how the movie just makes the chance of missing something important so small after a certain point.My final rating is 3/10 - 2 points for great filming and photography and the effort. It would be OK for watching at home on a dark winter evening, having a hot cup of tea and some distraction to sit through it. But definitely not worth going to the cinema to see it.",The Snowman

So, after ""Tinker tailor soldier spy"" (in my opinion a truly brilliant masterpiece) I expected that Alfredson would be capable to extract the best of Nesbo's novel and make a thriller of quality. Especially because he doesn't produce films one after another and obviously needs some time between them. 6 years in this case.
But, unfortunately it turned out just the oposite. I honestly think that I could make such movie. A movie without passion, dull and shallow. Many things from the book are altered for no reason.

It is true that he book is better, very good in fact, but then again I am not sure I have seen a film that is better than the book they were based upon. This film is undoubtedly beautifully shot and the acting is good, Fassbender is very good as usual, infact he is a perfect Harry Hole and so are the supporting cast. The script it okay. The biggest problem is the bits of the story you do not see and have to guess at some of the motives and odd scenes that pop up. For me it helped that I had read the book I could see where things fitted better. Overall it feels like a fabulous film that has been edited by a novice. Having said that there are some wonderful scenes and at times edge of your seat drama ( the sinking car!). I was disappointed that they missed out the best scene in the book which was the stand off (sit off really) with Rakel at the end which is some of the best bits of writing I have read in a long while. Don't let the low score or the misguided criticism put you off this film. if you do not know the story it will keep you guessing and as mentioned the cinematography is beautiful. It is certainly not the best film of 2017 but it is certainly not the worst either and worth a watch if you have a couple of hours to spare.

It is not likely a critic's choice since the movie is very easy to analyze.

They must be people in/from Norway trying to hype up a story that originates from one of their compatriots. There's always outliers, but this goes beyond that, whatever the reason may be. Ignore the positive reviews, they are completely missing the mark. I still have a difficult time believing I actually watched this whole thing, I checked my phone for the time expecting to see that, based on the runtime, things should be winding down and that I'd soon be free from this abomination. I was shocked to see I was only 30 minutes into the movie. That's how boring and ridiculous this thing is. It was admitted that 10%-15% of the screenplay wasn't even filmed.. for whatever reason. They probably filmed in 8k and were shocked to see how fast the SSD was filling up and said to hell with it, let's just start wrapping this thing up. I think 10%-15% was a exaggeration, as the film watches as if 25% of the entire story is missing. I haven't read the book, and while the author I'm sure is popular for a reason, this movie has tainted me forever and I will avoid books from this author forever. If I was him, I would be proper angry over how they butchered one of my stories.What the hell kind of name is Harry Hole? I could hardly believe it. Harry freakin' Hole? What? I was even more shocked to hear there's a whole ""Harry Hole"" series. What do fans of the series say, ""Oh yes, I'm a huge Harry Hole fan, I can't get enough Harry Hole. I spend all day with my face buried in Harry Hole novels."" Yikes.Enough of that. Onto why this movie is TERRIBLE,The plot is stupid, and doesn't make any sense. Or more specifically, why they formulated it how they did makes no sense. If this movie was a actual mathematical formula, it would not balance. The character development is so bad, I didn't care what happened to any of them. It almost seems like they go out of their way to insert elements into the story to ensure you don't care what happens to these characters. It's obvious a lot of important scenes are woefully missing, and in their place there's a bunch of scenes that add nothing(to anything). Probably only 25 minutes has any relevance of any kind, and even some of that is shaky at best. A lot of the stories elements are just plain stupid, or done in a stupid way. This movie makes for a perfect example of what a filmmaker, writer, director, should NOT do. Every single element that makes a story worthy of actually being a story is missing, or entirely fails. I gave this movie 1 star, because it's a rare movie that actually deserves it. I know some are giving a extra star or 2 because it's well shot, which it is, and that's all fine and good if your talking about a calendar or something, but not a movie.

But going to see a thriller knowing who the killer is and exactly what's going to happen is perhaps not the best context to watch a movie with. I think the reason I was so disappointed with this movie, was that it seemed like they have taken a chapter of a history and just put it out of context.I give it a 6, and that is only because Fassbenders acting and the visually great quality of some of the scenes. They had such a great book to film and the lead actor is perfect, so I do believe they used the budget on one actor and just cast the rest on a whim. The female leads are horrible and do not fit in their roles. The plot is sort of put together like a bad puzzle and some of it just don't belong there at all.I had the same experience with 50 Shades of Grey. Even though I did not love the books I did look forward to see the first movie, and then they manage to ruin it with a bad script and worse acting. But well the 5 stars for Fassbender is earned, he fits the role and he did act, perhaps not so excellent as in Shame or 12 Years a Slave, but he is what I imagined Harry Hole to be.I do also think that the movie would be different if Martin Scorsese had directed it and if the female lead characters where better actresses. The movie has some visually great scenes and the music are good, but it just don't manage to capture you in the way a good thriller should.

I was looking forward to this this film as the trailer made it seem like it was going to be this thrilling and exciting horror movie, frankly it was neither thrilling or exciting. The plot was sub par, I don't think the writer and director had a clue whether they were making a horror or crime drama. It was a boring poor birth child of them both. The only thing that made it interesting was the nice visuals of Oslo and the other all look of the film, that was nice.My main problem with the film is that as a crime drama goes there was little drama,barley any investigation and . Whenever there was a suspect it was not properly developed. What really annoyed me was the actually suspect was really nice to the main character and had no development, this made him a boring and uninteresting character. What annoyed me was his motives, without spoiling it they were poor and unrealistic. Also, why the hell would you go around building snowmen, in the intro the kid builds snow men but it's not explained why. Is it a coping method for what he is going through or is it something he enjoys to do. Doesn't make sense and not explained.I say the visuals are good because they shot it in a photogenic place. This instantly made it look nice. I could of shot it on my iPhone 5s and it would of been a 10/10 master piece, look wise. It's a beautiful place. However one visual problem was the poor VFX, when a mans head get shot his neck flops around like a half eaten frube. That made me chuckle. I shouldn't laugh when someone's head gets blown apart but the effects made it comical.The acting was all right, nothing interesting. Convocations where really stale, like a bagel at the bottom of my bread bin after I forgot to eat last summer. Therewas one shot where Harry Hole (What kind of unimaginative name is that, like seriously) is talking to his ex wife's new boyfriend. They are on a train and Harry has forgot about a camp he was going on with his son who doesn't know he's Harry's son or something along the lines of that. 2 problems with this is that firstly, Harry forgets a few things. It is set up like some kind of gimmick which is never acted upon. He just forgets things. This annoys me as I'm not sure why this was in the film, is it to make it relatable because men forget things? I don't know! Secondly it was such a boring scene. I had more amusement picking the chewing gum I accidentally stood in of my shoe. That is not why I watch a movie.

The only movie that can sink is the Titanic.Overall, watch it if you want but don't expect anything too great! Joe Beaumont",The Snowman

They should have stuck more closely to the book for Katrine Bratt, such an important part. Ave Stop did not come across as the charismatic media guru. Instead, he appeared to be somewhat impotent. ldar Vetlesen may as well have been cut right out of it. The script very loosely followed the book. The twists in the plot were poorly handled.

I decided to give the novel a miss so I could watch this flick with an open mind and enjoy this as a film, rather than criticise what had inevitably been left out.
 
First off, the cinematography was at times, simply breathtaking. The acting was good and the film itself captured my attention instantly.
Despite the disappointment of clocking the killer as soon as he made an appearance, (over character acting) this was starting to look like a quality dark thriller about a serial killer, the sort of film I've been waiting for since the end of the 90's. Unfortunately It was at this point the film began to fall apart.. 
I was hoping the killer was meant to be as obvious as he was, but by the end it became abundantly clear that he wasn't. I found myself losing interest less than halfway though. Gaps in the plot began to appear, the red herrings didn't work as (again) the actor of the killer was far too obvious. The film soon became a muddled mess that led to an ending which was very sudden, and poorly executed.All in all, a very forgettable and disappointing film that started with such promise.

The script and execution: unbelievably terrible.,4,26 September 2019,"I don't know what was worse, the similar sound effects, soundtrack, cinematography and overly-British accents to Steig Larson's Americanised 'Dragon Tattoo' Film. The storyline was so poor, no gore AT ALL, no viewpoint of the killer and victim, everything done from two protagonists, but one gets killed off without an interesting twist. So one protagonist left, who doesn't have much dialogue, has a stereotypical British accent while being smack-centre in the Norwegian countryside and Oslo city, no Norwegian-ness at all present in this movie. I am so upset with Fassbender for doing this movie. How could you not tell by the script that it would have no suspense. However.

And even though I do not remember everything about the plot/story of the Snowman, I remember it being one of the best reads i've had! And I feel the genious of Nesbøs writing is not coming through on the big screen, in fact i feel nothing else than disappointment. I do not hate this film, but I'm just utterly disappointed. How is it even possible to not respect the source material enough to make a decent movie, the material seems made for the big screen and I bet Fassbender could have made better character development if more time was given to build that up. Suspect the whole production of the movie to be rushed, watching it feels like watching an episode of some kind of slow moving crime series. By the end, its just too frustrating to watch because of big differences from the book, characters are not developed enough to care about them and you also stop caring about what happens. I sort of knew what I was going into reading some of the reviews, and had low expectations, but this really wasn't an ok Movie. Really wanted it to be good!",The Snowman
390,lulin-2,What was that,5,15 October 2017,"I've waited impatiently for The Snowman to come out for the last few weeks and I have to tell that I'm not impressed at all with what I saw.The movie should be based on the novel of Nesbo, but it was very far away from the thriller and the twists in the book. We didn't see at all the passion of Hoole, his obsession of finding the murderer. The characters were presented very bad. I've read the book and the Mould Man has a very big role in the investigation of Harry Hole and in finding the murderer, and in this movie i believe the spectators didn't get why was he in the motion picture at all.Many of the facts from the book were changed, and even the main reason for the murders and the illness of the Snowman were cut from the script and this gave completely different vision of the movie. In the book The Showman kills his mother in a cold-blooded way, when he was a child and she is his first victim, and in that way we realize how twisted and insane he is, and here in the motion picture, we saw very different thing in the beginning.And the way Katrine Brat thought that there is a connection between the snowing, married women with kids and the murders - this was totally nonsense at all, it was kind of funny I can say. And in some moment she should be considered as the Snowman, but that part was out of the script also.And the top moment of this film was the terrible ending when the killer fell in the ice out of nowhere. Who wrote this, and who approve it as a way of murdering the Snowman?! This was absolutely bad, to put it mildly, even if they wanted to kill the Snowman, there were hundreds of different ways to do it much better, although this was not part of the book ending, but when you cut the main reason from the plot this is what happens.I thing the norwegian cinema will present this book in a much better way, so I hope that this will not be the last movie for this horrific thriller of Nesbo.",The Snowman

395,topkontaktik,Deserves a TV series,4,5 August 2018,"I had read the book The Snowman by Jo Nesbø before I watched the movie and I liked it very much. The movie, however, tried to fit 500-page book into a 2-hour movie not only by omitting many scenes but also by totally changing the script or cutting the scenes.The result is that the movie is not understandable for viewers who are not familiar with the book because too many characters and their motivations remain unexplained (e.g. Rafto). And viewers who have read the book are disappointed that the characters they know from the book behave significantly differently in the movie than in the book.But the Norwegian movie settings are beautiful and I guess The Snowman deserves a 10-part TV series that would better transfer the book content into the movie script.

399,rajkumar2141,Spoilers contained :very Disappointing considering excellent Novel,5,14 October 2017,"Jo Nesbo is one of my favourite authors and his Harry Hole series to me is just superb they way he has over time captured the very essence of all the main characters especially their human frailties as well as their brilliance.On seeing original trailer i was really looking forward to this film version of my favourite Jo Nesbo novel but at times it departs so greatly from source material and there definitely appears to have been many re-shoots and cuts as a lot of main scenes in cinema trailer are not even in the film.This could and indeed should have been superb considering strength of source material and the quality of the assembled cast and whilst i cannot fault Michal or Charlotte as Harry & Katrina the whole film does seem disjointed and i have no idea why they made significant changes to such a great story.Spoilers below so don't read further unless you want to knowIt appears although i cannot be certain because there is definitely ambiguity as to what actually happens with Katrina Bratt, is she murdered by killer which is such a marked change from Harry Hole series i cannot for life of me fathom out why directors would take such a step if they indeed are hoping to make further Harry Hole films.Katrina Bratt is such a key character to several of the novels and is still alive and well in most recent one, as i said i am not 100% sure she was murdered as may just have been still unconscious after killer drugged her and removed her finger.Please do not judge Jo Nesbo's books especially the Harry Hole( Hol- leh) series which is superb. The Snowman is such a well written and crafted book where you get a real sense of the genius of Harry's detecting Brain, his personal demons and the sexual chemistry between himself and Katrina which is always lying just below the surface. I guarantee that most people who are slagging film off would love the novel so if you get a chance give it a read and see how good it is and what a waste of great material this film is.",The Snowman

404,karlo556,It is not bad,9,23 October 2017,"Seen a lot of negativity in the reviews. Here's an explanation. 1. It is a 5th book from the Jo Nesbø, Harry Hole series.All the cool and fairly ,let's say important, characters you meet in The Redbreast and so on. Those characters in the police force are in all of the book series. You only meet Katrine Bratt, which is a new character in the book also. There is no explanation on Rakel or her son in the movie because it is explained in the previous books.Blame the directors of whoever thought it would pass as a good movie when people who haven't read the book don't know who is who and what it what. It looks like a mess, but it all has a story and explanation. Every single characterIf it was made from the Redbreast, Nemesis and Devil's Star (trilogy), Redeemer and the comes Snowman... Leopard, Phantom, Police, The Thirst. Then you'd have a lot ot positive reviews.Before you watch the MOVIE read the books from the beginning (including the Snowman) and you'll find the movie awesome. Because movie as a movie looks like The Snowman movie is based on a poorly written novel.Meet the characters in the book and watch the movie. You'll see how much better it becomes.I find the movie surprisingly awesome!!! But I know who is who and what's their story. The beginning is done different than in the book.

The plot just seems to tap the nail without actually hitting it. As a result as a viewer I find myself lost and at times bored. I don't feel I really know Harry Hole and the character bond I have with Katrine is far worse (and she is a really important character to the whole plot). I think once the writers failed in this aspect the film was always doomed in my mind at least.It's a real shame as I really bought into the premise, I love a crime thriller / who-dunnit set in a desolate landscape. There's a great cast and some good performances (Val Kilmer's cameo is really cool, I feel he grasps and portrays his character really well, as Mr Fassbender does) which makes it an even harder pill to swallow.

Instead the film strives, successfully, to evoke the atmosphere of Scandinavian Noire, while employing the story telling techniques of Knut Hamsun - no character development, no exposition, and entering the story mid-crisis. I wish it had been recorded in Norwegian so we could appreciate the conflict between Bergen and Oslo, so integral to the books. it's a mood film, not simply a whodunit. bringing in familiar USA actors was a clever red herring, but probably won't be appreciated, and instead some will complain these actors didn't get more screen time. finally, the anti-tourism photography of winter instead served the story and was worth the price of admission to the big screen view.

It stars Michael Fassbender, so you expect it to get good at some point. It does not.Instead, watch it as the hilarious, shockingly awful piece of garbage it is. His name is Harry Hole! He frequently passes out drunk in the snow! Their office is, for some reason, a giant echo-y room, which is never explained! Off-brand Olympics! JK Simmons does the weirdest accent I've ever heard and makes no sense as a character! Sudden, unexplained identical twins! Plot holes galore! The killer's notes aren't scary (addressed to ""Mister Police"" like a child). Neither are his snowmen scary! A spy camera the size of a briefcase! Nothing makes sense! And my favorite: Val Kilmer's lines are dubbed so poorly I laugh every time (apparently he'd had throat cancer surgery and was unintelligible-that part isn't funny, but the bad subbing someone else decided on is). I've seen it at least 10 times and I can never figure out exactly who made all of these terrible choices, but it's like a movie made by committee with everyone's bad ideas all incorporated into one film.It's genuinely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Bad writing, bad directing, bad editing...just bad choices from almost everyone involved. The acting isn't all bad, but it can't save this dumpster fire of a film. Whenever I'm feeling down, I turn it on and enjoy noting every nonsensical part of this movie.

Ask the actors, if anybody actually told someone who worked on this project that this was a ""clever"" or ""stimulating"" film they are either going to laugh at your low intelligence or try to fight you for provoking them. Seriously I read a few reviews on here. How could anyone give this a 9 or say things like ""the rest of you Michael Bay lovers won't get it""? I can't stand blow crap up actions or stupid nonsense plots, I mean the marvel movies are really lucky to get my money, but this is isn't anybody's cup of tea. If you like movies, you know films, stories that are told through meaningful dialogue and backed up with chronological and relevant scenes, then you will hate this. If you are trying to have a mentally stimulating evening try licking a window instead.If you want to teach people how to NOT screw up an entire film project, show them this in school.",The Snowman
441,angelgabi,After reading the book...,8,7 December 2019,"..... I watched the movie.
Well made movie, not your typical American sensationalized hype. It's deep, dark good Scandinavian Psychological thriller.
It's gripping and needs some better reviews, from people that know how to apply their minds.",The Snowman
442,lagalasoo,A Horror!,6,23 October 2017,"If you enjoy gruesome, gore, and horror this one's for you. Otherwise, the film's story is boring. It's just another who done it. There are far too many characters introduced just to confuse, and you soon give up trying to keep track. But, if you like winter and lots of snow and beautiful scenes of Oslo and Bergen, Norway then that will distract from the rest of the film.",The Snowman
443,shanine-salmon,A great story limited by the constraints of film,4,17 October 2017,"There are many issues with The Snowman. Fassbender is miscast and as a result, his character of Harry Hole makes no sense. How is this great detective THIS MAN? What is even more difficult is that this film makes no sense in its two-hour format. This was a 500-page book condensed into a predictable and nonsensical two hours. It is clear Scorsese felt this should be a TV show and walked away when it could only be made into a film. Tomas Alfredson is great at making long, complicated works make sense (His Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy was close to perfect) but even using great screen adaptators like Peter Straughan cannot make this work.The biggest issue is not the story, about women who are murdered and mutilated by a man using a Snowman as his MO, but the casting. Only the genuinely Scandinavian actors work, such as Rebecca Ferguson, David Dencik and Jonas Karlsson in their roles. Val Kilmer's presence is baffling but he provides some of the most interesting scenes.It feels like a production with no vision and even Alfredson's signature style of being voyeurs as we look through windows becomes dull. It is a disservice to not only Jo Nesbo but all Scandi-Noir.",The Snowman
444,pbjugn,Not a bad movie if you haven't read the book,7,15 October 2017,"For a start, my way into this is without having read any of the Harry Hole novels (which all the critics seems to have). So I can look at this movie from a somewhat more objective view and, I conclude, it's not bad. To me this feels like more of a super hero movie in genre in that the characters, both the likable and the less likable characters are a bit flat, I admit that but I think it works out well (this is why it reminds me of a classic super hero movie).Especially I like the secondary story told flashbacks about Rafto, the drunken police man, intriguingly played by Val Kilmer. Also Rebecca Ferguson and J.K. Simmons do good appearances. Michael Fassbender obviously the key performer, doing an excellent and trustworthy appearance. Although not as good as ""Tinker, Solder, Sailor, Spy"" (reg: Tomas Alfredson) or ""The Dark Knight"" (reg: Christopher Nolan), I think Alfredson this time is somehow within range of these movies on certain elements (such as scenery, pace, intriguing social milieu).I hear the novels are fast and direct, while I think the movie is a mix between an action and slow paced movie. Therefor I think you should not watch this as 1) a direct comparison to the books, or 2) towards a book (which you haven't read) but heard excellent things about, and as bad comparisons between the book and the movie.",The Snowman
445,natashaslick,Absolute mess!!,1,16 October 2017,The first ten minutes are undeniably the best parts of the movie- after that you might as well walk out and ask for your full refund at the box office. The only reason I didn't walk out myself is because i was so intrigued as to how they were going to wrap up this whole mess.However i must give credit to the beautiful cinematography and almost bearable acting by Fassbender and Ferguson- two of my favourite actors.Where do i start with this review? I'll just list everything that comes to mind starting with the fact that they managed to convince us that everyone in Norway (where the movie is set) speaks perfect English. Trying so hard to make us believe one person (I won't say who) is the killer that it actually creates massive loop holes at the end when we come to find out who the actual killer is. Useless characters who do nothing for the progress of the plot (but just a side story of what could possibly lead to another movie).The villain killing off a wide range of people- who again make the plot even more senseless and confusing. I'll be honest I still don't understand the movie and nor do I want to. Finally the ending- you manage to find out who the killer is half way though the movie but you convince yourself that it's not true as IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE. My only regret after watching the entire movie is not walking out after the first ten minutes. Word of advice DO NOT WATCH!!!,The Snowman
446,leada-09175,Disaster,1,16 October 2017,"Dear Mr. Nesbo, I'm really disappointed from The snowman movie. Such a waste of your talent. I don't expect that movies will be exact like a book, but this movie is really boring. Michael Fassbender it's a great actor, but he has nothing to do with Harry Hole. Actress playing Rakel, oh, I can't imagine the worst choice for this role. Katrin character was the good choice, but that was it... I love your books, I love Harry Hole books, I love The Son book, but this movie is waste of money. It had a great potential to make a great movie, but not like this :-(",The Snowman
447,tutorphd,failed potential,2,19 October 2017,"Beautiful winter cinematography, excellent soundtrack, and stellar cast were ruined by the way the plot was presented. I was intrigued in the beginning but once the movie picked up pace in the middle, way too many irrelevant short scenes were taking place in parallel and dumped on the viewer, and I found myself fighting to not fall asleep. The end was laughable in its futile attempts to be dramatic. The whole story felt incredibly amateurish to the point of ridiculous.",The Snowman
448,bsfrc,Worthy movie for every Movie lover Never to miss and lose.,10,23 October 2017,"It is a class thriller and gripping till the end. It is one of the finest in the class of thriller movies in terms of screenplay, photography and last but not least the story telling mechanism is stylish. Mystery is held tight and never could be revealed.Worth for the money. I think the world of movie review must lay out certain key indicators to be fair and honest and give true review The only shock was the general review I saw about this movie but what I saw was pretty cool. Coolest scenic beauty of European cities and cold winter snow added to the mystery value including some lifestyle and culture exposure for the audience. There is still room for improvements but the catch is deliberate subtleties pumped in the screenplay to confuse and keep biting the nails till end with some release of pressure from time to time to introduce new complexities. Overall a refreshing movie for thrill seekers..",The Snowman
449,farklefranuget,Not as bad as many people say,8,1 November 2017,"Like the summary, I believe the movie isn't as half as bad people say it is. People talk nonsense about characters.

Sure there are plots that might deem as dull, but altogether the movie was quite pleasing and interesting.",The Snowman

The film doesnt make sense.
Havent read the book but i guess that over 300 pages you get more sense than this.
What if rebecca ferguson didnt go into the trap?
What if Michale fassbender didnt get drunk?
What if Jk simmonds dint shout?
Have T Alfredson(mind you he made Tinker(a sensationally good movie ) gone mad?
The script writers(ie same as tinker) were they aware that the cutting would in fact make them surplus?

1 fork out of 5..",The Snowman
456,shopping-24105,"Great book, confusing movie",3,19 March 2018,"I've recently become a fan of Jo Nesbø's books, and have read the first seven Harry Hole novels. I had great hopes that this movie might help the flow of Nordic-based crime thrillers into movies that Stig Larsson and others began. Too bad that it wasn't so.The Snowman (as a book) is a terrific, if quite dark, crime thriller that throws out false clues and distractions, and even pretends to close up early a couple of times, but ends up as a fascinating and cohesive tale. By comparison, the movie offers quick glances into lives of several interacting characters following a similar path, without context to explain their quirks and motivations. Why was Harry involved in the Snowman case, and why was he getting clues from the killer? The movie doesn't say; it just happens. How was the killer choosing victims? A motivation is suggested, but doesn't completely fit with some of the actions. The same is true of Katrine Bratt's obsession with the case: her motivation is important, and helps to explain her actions; the movie just highlights that she *is* driven.Near the movie's end, I realized that the reason I was more disappointed than confused was that, having read the book, I could fill in the story gaps; if I had come in as a total novice, I can't image how I would have kept up with the plot. A complex, cerebral story like The Snowman will not translate verbatim onto the big screen. Plot elements may need to be trimmed; clues and background information may need condensing, or even blatant over-stating, to become linear and obvious in a 90-120 minute format. But therein lies the biggest paradox: while the movie cut out large and important portions of the story, the end result still managed to seem 30 minutes too long.I find it interesting that there are a couple of scenes in the trailers -- especially, the international one -- that seem to have been cut out of the movie proper. I clearly remember each one in the book. There was another story here -- it just got lost in the process of making a movie!",The Snowman

458,claspecialized,"Altered script, missing scenes from the trailer, average detective story",4,13 July 2018,"I love Harry Hole series. I have listened to all 11 audio-books several times just to hear how Harry lives and ages through them. This movie would be average detective thriller without ""Harry Hole"" brand. Even though lot of people could be confused by quite complicated plot and missing parts of the movie.The main plot differs so much from the original book. For example the movie kills characters which appear in following book (Leopard) and they have quite important role there. What a shame... I hope much better screen adaptation would come out later on. Harry series deserves proper HBO, NetFlix treatment....",The Snowman

460,k-38301,"Read it, saves you from disappointment and wasted time.",1,2 September 2018,"SPOILER ALERT
Still read it, it saves you from disappointment.
Think about a tarantino movie without a showdown.
The movie starts great and manages to build up a good thrill, then when you are ready for the orgasmic showdown...there is none.Like the director decided he doesnt cares anymore and just wants to get over with it.
Michael Fassbender doesn't need to fight, or put together a puzzle, and even fails to see the killer in the ""showdown"" who is shooting him with a pistol on a snow white frozen lake after Fassbender is screaming across the lake that he is ready for him. ( the killer isn't even wearing something white or so and just steps into the picture after the shot).
And then when the killer finally wants to shoot our blind detective dead he fails to see that there is a clearly visible hole in the ice and just steps into it and vanishes.If you want to see a good Scandinavian Thriller: Watch HEADHUNTERS!",The Snowman

462,mikenorman-82375,Started badly and just got worse,2,27 December 2018,"A baffling start to this movie simply set the tone for what turned out to be a very poor film that I urge you to avoid.I generally critique movies based on their realism, how likely is that to happen in real life, would this happen, would that happen etc? You get the gist, and hence I only watch dramas, thrillers, and horrors.From the very start this movie was full of head scratching moments that just made the movie so unrealistic and a huge disappointment. Like how did the murderer kill the woman in the hotel room (how did he know she was there for a start, and how did he get in the room) and within a few minutes, chop her finger off, know how to use a police computer, make the bed, and get the dead body out of the hotel room and the hotel itself without being seen.Why don't filmmakers watch what they've made and say to themselves, ""is that scene believable?"" And if the answer is no, then why hope that the viewers believe it or forgive it.Awful movie, avoid at all costs.",The Snowman
